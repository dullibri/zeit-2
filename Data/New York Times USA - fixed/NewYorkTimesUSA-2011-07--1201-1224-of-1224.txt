HEADLINE: Man Of The (Fine) Cloth

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRENDAN DOUGHERTY

 BODY:
Travis Cross, a 43-year-old unemployed hairdresser, was among the 200 or so people, most of them black and sharply dressed, filling the pews of Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Norfolk, Va., late last month. They had come to see visiting preacher Dr. Leroy Thompson -- ''the man of God, himself,'' Cross called him -- hold his ''Money Cometh to You'' conference, which promises that the Lord can solve even the worst financial problems. It was a message the congregation desperately wanted to hear; some of the bordering neighborhoods have unemployment rates over 15 percent.
''The blessing,'' Thompson said, ''is threefold: I'm saved, and I'm going to heaven. I got health in my body because I believe in healing. And I got money in my pocket because I believe in wealth.'' 
The calls for him to Preach! Preach! came from the assembly.
''My house is paid for,'' Thompson continued. ''And it's over 20,000 square feet! Fireplace after fireplace after fireplace. I got so many fireplaces in my house, you'll be walking through and call the fire truck!'' The room exploded in laughter and praise.
''Matthew says, 'Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and his' . . . what?'' he asked.
His righteousness!
''His what?''
His righteousness!
''And all these things shall be added to you.''
Mercy!
''Subtracted from you?''
No!
''Add! Add! Add!'' he thundered.
Thompson's Master Vision Bearers and Ministerial Association, who often travel with him and take their place in the front pews, stood up during emotional moments to add their descants of praise. Mount Pleasant's own stood up with them, matching, then exceeding, their intensity. The Bearers pulled bills and checks out of their wallets and placed them on Thompson's lectern. The local members rushed to outdo them again.
Travis Cross shifted his weight from one heel to the other as he listened to Thompson. It had been a bad year for him. ''People know me, high and low,'' Cross said. The mayor, the judge, his ex-girlfriend -- just about everyone in nearby Portsmouth knew he used to make six figures and that he owned his first building debt-free. And now they know that last fall he was evicted from his High Street shop and that the problem began when he bought a second building next door, where he was planning to open a Christian T-shirt company and a billiard hall. The building needed repairs, and he sank deeper and deeper into debt, and then in October 2010, the bank foreclosed on all of it -- more than $400,000 in total. He moved his wife and two daughters into a client's house, and his wife's paycheck for teaching was garnisheed for his debts. ''The Enemy tried to trick me and make me feel ashamed,'' he said.
In his troubles, Cross received a vision: ''The Lord told me to start doing these things with barbershop trailers.'' He plans to open his first next month. He believes his old buildings will continue to sit unsold as a lesson to him. ''I did it the world's way,'' he said, ''but now I'm going to get them back and more.''
Which is how he found himself seated toward the back of the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church. Shuffling behind the lectern, Thompson explained to cheers that ''no Christian should live in a ghetto.'' He testified that God gave him an abundant life, including a Falcon 900B airplane to deliver this message, as well as air conditioning so strong that he can wear a mink coat in the Louisiana summer.
He recounted Christ's parable from Matthew 25, in which the unprofitable servant's money is given to the profitable one. And he leveled with the congregation. ''A lot of the money I have has been taken from other people,'' he said. ''I didn't take it. The Lord took it. He gave it to me.
''Could it be that someone else has your money?'' Nearly a third of the congregation began jumping.
Cross had been waiting for this moment. Thompson announced the Holy Spirit's anointing and led the church in three ''pulls'' that would bring them wealth. The entire congregation, Cross included, leaned forward and thrust out their open right hands, then pulled them back to their sides in a closed fist, shouting: ''Money! Cometh to me now!''
Cross came to church with $60 in cash and left with none of it. ''All I had,'' he said. He put bills on the lectern throughout the service, and at the end he put the last in an envelope for Thompson's ministries. He described the moment he let the envelope go as ''an explosion,'' when all the guilt and shame he had been carrying melted away. He vowed to learn from Thompson, to stay debt-free, to ''owe no man nothing but love.''

 BODY:
Readers react to Wednesday's letter urging a more ambitious space program focusing on Mars.
The Letter
To the Editor:
Re ''After the Space Shuttle'' (editorial, July 22): As one of the most enthusiastic supporters of human spaceflight for 60 years, I appreciate your support of a ''far more ambitious set of manned voyages'' to follow the end of the shuttle program (which did, indeed, fail to live up to its promise) and ''inspire a new generation.''
I believe that Apollo and the shuttle's Hubble telescope repair flights proved conclusively the value of human spaceflight. Apollo sent half a dozen manned expeditions to land on the moon in less than a dozen years from the program's conception. That's ''ambitious,'' and it certainly inspired my generation.
Unfortunately, I cannot characterize the Obama plan as either ambitious or inspiring. President Obama wants us to spend the next 25 years on scientifically useless stunts like sending manned expeditions to land on a small asteroid and to orbit Mars. 
The goal is to land on Mars and search for life. We should immediately start on the Mars Direct proposal of Robert Zubrin, president of the Mars Society. We could return to the moon before this decade is out, followed by the first human landing on Mars early in the next decade. We could have permanent bases on the moon and perhaps Mars by the end of the next decade.

Like Mr. Morris, I, too, was thrilled by the Apollo program and heartened by the Hubble telescope repair, but I do not believe that either really ''proved conclusively the value of human spaceflight.''
Yes, there is excitement associated with manned space ventures, but these programs have been exceptionally costly, often wasteful and, of course, risky. Much more can be learned (and I would argue has been learned) about our universe through unmanned programs at far lower costs and with far lower risks.
Unless we can invent an inexpensive and safe, reliable way of supporting human beings in space (something that would seem exceptionally unlikely), whatever the future of humankind will be, it will be on Earth, not on our Moon, not on Mars and, I would agree, certainly not on a small asteroid.
Yes, we could return to the Moon and try to stay there, and we might be able to land human beings on Mars and try to stay there as well. But we should have learned the lessons of the last five decades or so. Too much was promised and too little achieved in putting humans into space and sustaining them there. These would, indeed, be ''stunts'' with only marginal real benefits for their extraordinary costs.
There are any number of other worthy and inspiring things that can and should be done on Earth, including doing whatever we can to make sure that it remains safe and secure for human (and all other species') habitation. That should be our legacy to future generations.
RICHARD D. REDDY Fredonia, N.Y., July 27, 2011
The writer is a professor of sociology at SUNY Fredonia.
Those of us who grew up on Walt Disney's ''Man in Space'' TV shows in the 1950s, which were narrated by Wernher von Braun, eagerly swallowed the promise of bases on the Moon and Mars and who knew where else Out There in our lifetime.
But after cold-war-driven Apollo, the big money for human space exploration ran out and has never come back. Every president since John F. Kennedy has possessed a nice space program on paper, but no other president has had the cash to ''make it so.'' President Obama doesn't have it, that's for sure.
What never ran out, of course, was the dreaming of Mr. Morris and millions of other Americans of a certain age. No amount of reality -- technical and management weaknesses that led to either deadly catastrophes or astronomic costs -- ever came close to overcoming the dreaming (and old-fashioned politics) that carried the shuttle program forward from start to finish.
My old heart is with you, Dick, sort of, but the thrill is gone.
WAYNE BIDDLE Baltimore, July 27, 2011
The writer is a former science and technology reporter for The New York Times and the author of ''Dark Side of the Moon: Wernher von Braun, the Third Reich and the Space Race.''
Mr. Morris's call for ''Mars Direct'' and human bases on Mars in 10 years is more ideological than practical. On the one hand, we have space enthusiasts who with unlimited enthusiasm and without political, economic, scientific or technological constraints advocate crash programs like Apollo.
On the other hand, we have politicians, most notably in Congress, designing human spaceflight simply to provide contracts to their constituents without regard for any real accomplishments or goals.
The latter group has made a mess of human spaceflight planning and may doom it to another 30 years of purposeless Earth-orbit flights. The former group, represented by Mr. Morris, has been totally marginalized in the political system.
We had a solution. The prestigious national commission led by a former aerospace executive, Norm Augustine, devised a flexible, sustainable ''pay as you go'' approach to exploring beyond Earth orbit. President Obama substantially adopted the plan.
Sadly, members of the space community didn't unite behind the president, instead preferring the Balkanized approach -- insisting that their favorite project, rocket contract or engineering approach was the only thing that they would support.
It appears that humans will dither on Earth rather than fly anywhere beyond it.
LOUIS FRIEDMAN Executive Director Emeritus The Planetary Society Pasadena, Calif., July 27, 2011
While I hesitate to call President Obama's plans for the next generation of American space exploration ''scientifically useless,'' I agree wholeheartedly that they fall far short of being ''ambitious'' and ''inspiring.''
In today's partisan political climate, our nation is in desperate need of a unifying endeavor, of an accomplishment that every American can point to and say, We did this. Not since we first landed on the Moon in 1969 has there been such a unifying factor in American life.
Americans are in search of something greater than themselves, a mission worthy of our nation. What better way to bring the country together than to look to the stars and launch ourselves into the heavens?
JUSTIN H. GRANSTEIN Scarsdale, N.Y., July 27, 2011
While I agree with Mr. Morris that the country should plan on a return to the Moon and ultimately send humans to Mars, I think we should focus on the process we use to get there. In the 1950s, Wernher von Braun (among others) advised that we develop rockets with recoverable and reusable ascent stages, build a permanent space station that incorporated artificial gravity (through rotation), use that station as a platform for staging lunar exploration, develop a permanent lunar colony, and finally, send humans to Mars.
Instead, at President John F. Kennedy's direction, we began a crash program to send men to the Moon. The result was a series of purpose-built rockets and spacecraft that left no successor hardware once the Apollo program ended. The space shuttle similarly represents a dead-end technology. And the multibillion-dollar space station is scheduled to be deorbited after 2020 , leaving nothing behind.
Part of the reason this keeps happening is fickle and insufficient financing by the government. But undoubtedly part of the problem lies with NASA's inability or unwillingness to outline a clear long-term development program that results in sustainable and evolving technology.
I support the current administration's decision to rely more on private industry to push new technologies and hardware programs forward. NASA can assist with grants for research and prototype development, but ultimately, it should be up to private industry to get us into space and keep us there.
As for the space station, I suggest that we auction it off to a consortium of private companies while it still has some economic value. Perhaps they can find a way to extend its useful life and use it as base for further development.
JAY EDELMAN Fremont, Calif., July 27, 2011
In decrying President Obama's rollback of the American space program, Mr. Morris reminds us that the exploration of the final frontier is far from a faded dream.
A manned mission to Mars within the next 20 years would bolster job creation and reclaim America's role as a pre-eminent spacefaring country. Moreover, the quest for life in other worlds would yield a mother lode of scientific knowledge.
Apollo 11 helped us shed the bonds of terra firma. When the Eagle lunar module alighted on the shores of an alien sea -- the moon's Mare Tranquillitatis -- it was the culmination of centuries of human progress. We had escaped low Earth orbit to soar the skyway of the gods.
We must not forsake our cosmic destiny. Though a journey to the stars is fraught with peril and hardship, it remains humanity's most noble imperative: Per ardua ad astra (through adversity to the stars).
ROSARIO A. IACONIS Mineola, N.Y., July 27, 2011
The last shuttle flight is not the end. Indeed, much of the excitement is still in space. Our bodies may go into space less often, or not at all, but the hummingbirds we send up continue to sing back to us.
Voyager I and II, launched nearly four years before the first shuttle, have left the solar system and to this day are talking to us about the edge of our sun's influence. The Spirit rover, intended to tweet to us from Mars for three months, sang loud for six years. Its brother, Opportunity, still sings, and successors are planned.
Cassini has been joyously celebrating its vacation in orbit around Saturn since 2004 and has made plans to stay until 2017.
Many more of our little birds are talking to us, including Messenger, which entered orbit around Mercury just four months ago.
What's not to be excited about?
EDWARD REID Tallahassee, Fla., July 27, 2011
President Obama's manned spaceflight plans, while far from audacious, reflect an unfortunate reality: There is little political will in Congress to adequately finance a return to the Moon in 10 years and land on Mars shortly thereafter. The commercial crew program, which relies on private companies to build and operate orbital spacecraft, and the plans for a rendezvous with an asteroid by 2025 are more within the realm of possibility given current budget constraints.
The 2025 asteroid mission is hardly useless scientifically. It will be the first test of our ability to send astronauts far beyond the Earth-Moon system -- critical to a Mars mission. And if we ever have to deflect a space object from a collision course with Earth, understanding how to interact with asteroids is crucial.
Landing on Mars will be an extraordinarily hazardous and costly enterprise. We should be realistic about the timeline for manned space exploration, particularly in the face of deep cuts to NASA's budget.
ALEX TEACHEY Brooklyn, July 27, 2011
I agree with Mr. Morris's comments about pursuing deeper missions in space: a Moon space station, a manned mission to Mars! Instead, what appears to be happening is an entrepreneurial ''gold rush'' to the moon for the Google LunarX Prize, and an emphasis on the moon as the next big ''market'' ( ''In a Private Race to the Moon, Flights of Fancy Are in the Air,'' front page, July 22).
Let us go to the moon, but as a public-private, scientifically viable expedition that is in the interest of all mankind. Let us be guided by, and expand, both the Outer Space Treaty (1967) and the Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (1979).
These United Nations agreements emphasize that the moon (and other celestial bodies) should be explored for the benefit of all mankind; that its exploration should prevent disruption of its environment; and that its resources are the common heritage of all mankind.

The Writer Responds
Like Mr. Granstein, I hesitated to characterize the planned precursor missions to an asteroid or Mars orbit as ''scientifically useless,'' but did so because I have not seen a credible explanation of what scientific, or other, benefits will result from them. For example, we do not need a manned expedition to return samples from an asteroid. Indeed, we already have tens, if not hundreds, of tons of asteroid samples in museums and private collections. They're called ''meteorites.'' We know what asteroids are made of in great detail. Nor do we need to know the composition of a particular asteroid before deflecting it from a potential collision course with Earth.
The proposed precursor missions amount to little more than test flights of some of the systems that we will use to return to the Moon and go on to Mars. But there are other ways to accomplish that, and more, such as by landing the initial elements of a lunar base on the Moon, over a period of about a year, followed by a manned lunar landing, using the same hardware that will be used for Mars flights.
I agree with Professor Reddy that we need much greater efforts to control costs and improve reliability, and that unmanned spacecraft have returned a great deal of useful information. Unmanned spacecraft do an excellent job of taking photographs and measuring particles and fields under remote control, but I think a case can be made that, based on the amount of information returned, the Apollo landings were more cost-effective than the unmanned precursors.
As for Mars, the Spirit rover was a wonderful little machine and Opportunity rover continues to be, but a manned expedition could have accomplished as much exploration in a few weeks and returned actual samples as well.
Contrary to the claim by Mr. Friedman, I do not advocate a ''crash program'' but a properly paced one: stretching programs out, such as by developing program elements in series that are designed to work together, greatly increases their total costs. A first Mars landing is doable in 10 to 12 years, but a permanent base will take more like 20 to 25 years.
I am acutely aware of the political constraints that have confined us to low Earth orbit for nearly 40 years, but the technological constraints have been overblown: We have had virtually all the technology required for manned expeditions to Mars for decades. There were serious and credible plans for manned Mars expeditions to follow up on the Apollo program.
If the manned space program had been competently managed from the early 1970s through the early 1990s, we would have bases on the Moon and Mars today, and it all could have cost less than we have actually spent in the interim.
The cost of everything we do in space is largely a function of the cost of getting there. Low-cost Earth-to-orbit transportation requires that we build reliable, fully reusable launch vehicles, and we have had the technology to do that for more than 40 years. A two-stage, fully reusable, vertical-takeoff-and-landing launcher could have been developed for about what we spent on the shuttle, and would have cost far less to operate.
Such a vehicle would have many other uses besides human lunar and Mars exploration, thus immunizing those programs from cancellation, as happened with Apollo.
This country needs, and deserves, a more aggressive human spaceflight program, and it needs it now. The capabilities of thousands of engineers and technicians will be difficult to recreate later once they have been lost. And we are at great risk of losing what remains of our lead in space technology and development.

But there are other ways to accomplish that, and more, such as by landing the initial elements of a lunar base on the Moon, over a period of about a year, followed by a manned lunar landing, using the same hardware that will be used for Mars flights.
I agree with Professor Reddy that we need much greater efforts to control costs and improve reliability, and that unmanned spacecraft have returned a great deal of useful information. Unmanned spacecraft do an excellent job of taking photographs and measuring particles and fields under remote control, but I think a case can be made that, based on the amount of information returned, the Apollo landings were more cost-effective than the unmanned precursors.
As for Mars, the Spirit rover was a wonderful little machine and Opportunity rover continues to be, but a manned expedition could have accomplished as much exploration in a few weeks and returned actual samples as well.
Contrary to the claim by Mr. Friedman, I do not advocate a ''crash program'' but a properly paced one: stretching programs out, such as by developing program elements in series that are designed to work together, greatly increases their total costs. A first Mars landing is doable in 10 to 12 years, but a permanent base will take more like 20 to 25 years.
I am acutely aware of the political constraints that have confined us to low Earth orbit for nearly 40 years, but the technological constraints have been overblown: We have had virtually all the technology required for manned expeditions to Mars for decades. There were serious and credible plans for manned Mars expeditions to follow up on the Apollo program.
If the manned space program had been competently managed from the early 1970s through the early 1990s, we would have bases on the Moon and Mars today, and it all could have cost less than we have actually spent in the interim.
The cost of everything we do in space is largely a function of the cost of getting there. Low-cost Earth-to-orbit transportation requires that we build reliable, fully reusable launch vehicles, and we have had the technology to do that for more than 40 years. A two-stage, fully reusable, vertical-takeoff-and-landing launcher could have been developed for about what we spent on the shuttle, and would have cost far less to operate.
Such a vehicle would have many other uses besides human lunar and Mars exploration, thus immunizing those programs from cancellation, as happened with Apollo.
This country needs, and deserves, a more aggressive human spaceflight program, and it needs it now. The capabilities of thousands of engineers and technicians will be difficult to recreate later once they have been lost. And we are at great risk of losing what remains of our lead in space technology and development.

 BODY:
Readers react to Wednesday's letter urging a more ambitious space program focusing on Mars.
The Letter
To the Editor:
Re ''After the Space Shuttle'' (editorial, July 22): As one of the most enthusiastic supporters of human spaceflight for 60 years, I appreciate your support of a ''far more ambitious set of manned voyages'' to follow the end of the shuttle program (which did, indeed, fail to live up to its promise) and ''inspire a new generation.''
I believe that Apollo and the shuttle's Hubble telescope repair flights proved conclusively the value of human spaceflight. Apollo sent half a dozen manned expeditions to land on the moon in less than a dozen years from the program's conception. That's ''ambitious,'' and it certainly inspired my generation.
Unfortunately, I cannot characterize the Obama plan as either ambitious or inspiring. President Obama wants us to spend the next 25 years on scientifically useless stunts like sending manned expeditions to land on a small asteroid and to orbit Mars. 
The goal is to land on Mars and search for life. We should immediately start on the Mars Direct proposal of Robert Zubrin, president of the Mars Society. We could return to the moon before this decade is out, followed by the first human landing on Mars early in the next decade. We could have permanent bases on the moon and perhaps Mars by the end of the next decade.

Readers React
Like Mr. Morris, I, too, was thrilled by the Apollo program and heartened by the Hubble telescope repair, but I do not believe that either really ''proved conclusively the value of human spaceflight.''
Yes, there is excitement associated with manned space ventures, but these programs have been exceptionally costly, often wasteful and, of course, risky. Much more can be learned (and I would argue has been learned) about our universe through unmanned programs at far lower costs and with far lower risks.
Unless we can invent an inexpensive and safe, reliable way of supporting human beings in space (something that would seem exceptionally unlikely), whatever the future of humankind will be, it will be on Earth, not on our Moon, not on Mars and, I would agree, certainly not on a small asteroid.
Yes, we could return to the Moon and try to stay there, and we might be able to land human beings on Mars and try to stay there as well. But we should have learned the lessons of the last five decades or so. Too much was promised and too little achieved in putting humans into space and sustaining them there. These would, indeed, be ''stunts'' with only marginal real benefits for their extraordinary costs.
There are any number of other worthy and inspiring things that can and should be done on Earth, including doing whatever we can to make sure that it remains safe and secure for human (and all other species') habitation. That should be our legacy to future generations.
RICHARD D. REDDY Fredonia, N.Y., July 27, 2011
The writer is a professor of sociology at SUNY Fredonia.
Those of us who grew up on Walt Disney's ''Man in Space'' TV shows in the 1950s, which were narrated by Wernher von Braun, eagerly swallowed the promise of bases on the Moon and Mars and who knew where else Out There in our lifetime.
But after cold-war-driven Apollo, the big money for human space exploration ran out and has never come back. Every president since John F. Kennedy has possessed a nice space program on paper, but no other president has had the cash to ''make it so.'' President Obama doesn't have it, that's for sure.
What never ran out, of course, was the dreaming of Mr. Morris and millions of other Americans of a certain age. No amount of reality -- technical and management weaknesses that led to either deadly catastrophes or astronomic costs -- ever came close to overcoming the dreaming (and old-fashioned politics) that carried the shuttle program forward from start to finish.
My old heart is with you, Dick, sort of, but the thrill is gone.
WAYNE BIDDLE Baltimore, July 27, 2011
The writer is a former science and technology reporter for The New York Times and the author of ''Dark Side of the Moon: Wernher von Braun, the Third Reich and the Space Race.''
Mr. Morris's call for ''Mars Direct'' and human bases on Mars in 10 years is more ideological than practical. On the one hand, we have space enthusiasts who with unlimited enthusiasm and without political, economic, scientific or technological constraints advocate crash programs like Apollo.
On the other hand, we have politicians, most notably in Congress, designing human spaceflight simply to provide contracts to their constituents without regard for any real accomplishments or goals.
The latter group has made a mess of human spaceflight planning and may doom it to another 30 years of purposeless Earth-orbit flights. The former group, represented by Mr. Morris, has been totally marginalized in the political system.
We had a solution. The prestigious national commission led by a former aerospace executive, Norm Augustine, devised a flexible, sustainable ''pay as you go'' approach to exploring beyond Earth orbit. President Obama substantially adopted the plan.
Sadly, members of the space community didn't unite behind the president, instead preferring the Balkanized approach -- insisting that their favorite project, rocket contract or engineering approach was the only thing that they would support.
It appears that humans will dither on Earth rather than fly anywhere beyond it.
LOUIS FRIEDMAN Executive Director Emeritus The Planetary Society Pasadena, Calif., July 27, 2011
While I hesitate to call President Obama's plans for the next generation of American space exploration ''scientifically useless,'' I agree wholeheartedly that they fall far short of being ''ambitious'' and ''inspiring.''
In today's partisan political climate, our nation is in desperate need of a unifying endeavor, of an accomplishment that every American can point to and say, We did this. Not since we first landed on the Moon in 1969 has there been such a unifying factor in American life.
Americans are in search of something greater than themselves, a mission worthy of our nation. What better way to bring the country together than to look to the stars and launch ourselves into the heavens?
JUSTIN H. GRANSTEIN Scarsdale, N.Y., July 27, 2011
While I agree with Mr. Morris that the country should plan on a return to the Moon and ultimately send humans to Mars, I think we should focus on the process we use to get there. In the 1950s, Wernher von Braun (among others) advised that we develop rockets with recoverable and reusable ascent stages, build a permanent space station that incorporated artificial gravity (through rotation), use that station as a platform for staging lunar exploration, develop a permanent lunar colony, and finally, send humans to Mars.
Instead, at President John F. Kennedy's direction, we began a crash program to send men to the Moon. The result was a series of purpose-built rockets and spacecraft that left no successor hardware once the Apollo program ended. The space shuttle similarly represents a dead-end technology. And the multibillion-dollar space station is scheduled to be deorbited after 2020 , leaving nothing behind.
Part of the reason this keeps happening is fickle and insufficient financing by the government. But undoubtedly part of the problem lies with NASA's inability or unwillingness to outline a clear long-term development program that results in sustainable and evolving technology.
I support the current administration's decision to rely more on private industry to push new technologies and hardware programs forward. NASA can assist with grants for research and prototype development, but ultimately, it should be up to private industry to get us into space and keep us there.
As for the space station, I suggest that we auction it off to a consortium of private companies while it still has some economic value. Perhaps they can find a way to extend its useful life and use it as base for further development.
JAY EDELMAN Fremont, Calif., July 27, 2011
In decrying President Obama's rollback of the American space program, Mr. Morris reminds us that the exploration of the final frontier is far from a faded dream.
A manned mission to Mars within the next 20 years would bolster job creation and reclaim America's role as a pre-eminent spacefaring country. Moreover, the quest for life in other worlds would yield a mother lode of scientific knowledge.
Apollo 11 helped us shed the bonds of terra firma. When the Eagle lunar module alighted on the shores of an alien sea -- the moon's Mare Tranquillitatis -- it was the culmination of centuries of human progress. We had escaped low Earth orbit to soar the skyway of the gods.
We must not forsake our cosmic destiny. Though a journey to the stars is fraught with peril and hardship, it remains humanity's most noble imperative: Per ardua ad astra (through adversity to the stars).
ROSARIO A. IACONIS Mineola, N.Y., July 27, 2011
The last shuttle flight is not the end. Indeed, much of the excitement is still in space. Our bodies may go into space less often, or not at all, but the hummingbirds we send up continue to sing back to us.
Voyager I and II, launched nearly four years before the first shuttle, have left the solar system and to this day are talking to us about the edge of our sun's influence. The Spirit rover, intended to tweet to us from Mars for three months, sang loud for six years. Its brother, Opportunity, still sings, and successors are planned.
Cassini has been joyously celebrating its vacation in orbit around Saturn since 2004 and has made plans to stay until 2017.
Many more of our little birds are talking to us, including Messenger, which entered orbit around Mercury just four months ago.
What's not to be excited about?
EDWARD REID Tallahassee, Fla., July 27, 2011
President Obama's manned spaceflight plans, while far from audacious, reflect an unfortunate reality: There is little political will in Congress to adequately finance a return to the Moon in 10 years and land on Mars shortly thereafter. The commercial crew program, which relies on private companies to build and operate orbital spacecraft, and the plans for a rendezvous with an asteroid by 2025 are more within the realm of possibility given current budget constraints.
The 2025 asteroid mission is hardly useless scientifically. It will be the first test of our ability to send astronauts far beyond the Earth-Moon system -- critical to a Mars mission. And if we ever have to deflect a space object from a collision course with Earth, understanding how to interact with asteroids is crucial.
Landing on Mars will be an extraordinarily hazardous and costly enterprise. We should be realistic about the timeline for manned space exploration, particularly in the face of deep cuts to NASA's budget.
ALEX TEACHEY Brooklyn, July 27, 2011
I agree with Mr. Morris's comments about pursuing deeper missions in space: a Moon space station, a manned mission to Mars! Instead, what appears to be happening is an entrepreneurial ''gold rush'' to the moon for the Google LunarX Prize, and an emphasis on the moon as the next big ''market'' ( ''In a Private Race to the Moon, Flights of Fancy Are in the Air,'' front page, July 22).
Let us go to the moon, but as a public-private, scientifically viable expedition that is in the interest of all mankind. Let us be guided by, and expand, both the Outer Space Treaty (1967) and the Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (1979).
These United Nations agreements emphasize that the moon (and other celestial bodies) should be explored for the benefit of all mankind; that its exploration should prevent disruption of its environment; and that its resources are the common heritage of all mankind.

The Writer Responds
Like Mr. Granstein, I hesitated to characterize the planned precursor missions to an asteroid or Mars orbit as ''scientifically useless,'' but did so because I have not seen a credible explanation of what scientific, or other, benefits will result from them. For example, we do not need a manned expedition to return samples from an asteroid. Indeed, we already have tens, if not hundreds, of tons of asteroid samples in museums and private collections. They're called ''meteorites.'' We know what asteroids are made of in great detail. Nor do we need to know the composition of a particular asteroid before deflecting it from a potential collision course with Earth.
The proposed precursor missions amount to little more than test flights of some of the systems that we will use to return to the Moon and go on to Mars. But there are other ways to accomplish that, and more, such as by landing the initial elements of a lunar base on the Moon, over a period of about a year, followed by a manned lunar landing, using the same hardware that will be used for Mars flights.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees Washington as Mad, And the Capital Doesn't Argue

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Ground zero of the debt crisis in Washington just might be Speaker John A. Boehner's call center, hidden away in a corner of the Capitol, where five besieged staff members have as many as 300 people on hold at a time. ''Diane from Oregon'' managed to get through on Thursday to tell the center's director, Thomas A. Andrews, that Mr. Boehner should ''cut spending now.''
Mr. Andrews, 24, thanked her for her thoughts, then checked to see how long her wait time had been. ''Oh, it's actually down to 30 minutes,'' he said, cheered that it was not an hour and a half. Quickly, he returned to work, where the rest of an astonishing deluge -- 15,000 voice mail messages and 30,000 e-mails a day -- cried out for his attention.
If the rest of the country thinks Washington has gone mad this summer, that is pretty much the view in this bewildered capital, too, even in Mr. Boehner's overwhelmed call center. 
Among the bar patrons at the Old Ebbitt Grill worried about stock portfolios, the tourists anxious about disability checks and the current and former policy makers stunned by Washington paralysis, the mood was described variously as one of doom, disgust and disbelief.
Washington is talking of little else.
''I never saw anything like this, and I never thought I would see anything like this,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Federal Reserve governor who has been fielding calls to his Washington research firm, Macroeconomic Advisers, from worried hedge fund clients. ''I never appreciated how dysfunctional our political system is.''
Tourists who have come from around the world to see messy American democracy in action are watching far more mess than they ever expected.
''You guys are nuts,'' said Joseph Eastwood, 44, a Toronto accountant who was waiting in the Capitol Visitor Center for a tour last week. ''Instead of building the country, you're destroying it.''
A German tourist standing nearby was more tactful but was perplexed as he tried to teach his two teenage children about the scale of United States debt. ''They are not quite understanding the sum of money borrowed,'' said Peter Radewahn, 54, the director of a Bonn lobbying group. (The United States has about $14 trillion in debt, which is 99.5 percent of its yearly economic output. Germany has $2.85 trillion in debt, or 80 percent of its output.)
Mr. Radewahn said he did not want to say more because he was a guest in America and wished to be diplomatic.
At the Washington National Zoo on Saturday, Dean Thompson, 53, a Republican and a mechanical engineer visiting from Augusta, Ga., was filled with disdain for lawmakers of both parties on Capitol Hill. ''They're playing with people's savings is what they're doing,'' he said. ''It's like a game to them.''
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, fumed on Friday that although Mr. Boehner was throwing ''piece after piece of red meat to his right-wing lions'' -- that is, Tea Party-allied Republicans who are steadfastly opposed to raising the debt limit -- they were never sated.
Of course, few could match the scorn last week of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who, quoting an editorial in The Wall Street Journal, derided the ''Tea Party Hobbits.'' (Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Tea Party-allied Republican, later retorted, ''I'd rather be a hobbit than a troll.'')
Beyond the sniping of opposing lawmakers, this legislative crisis has reached deeper into the layers of Washington, perhaps even more than the protracted debate over health care did.
Much of what is occurring in Congress may be incomprehensible, but the basic issue -- that the United States needs to increase the limit on its credit card or not be able to pay its bills -- is understood.
''I get people stopping me around the Capitol more, asking what's going to happen,'' said Kelly O'Donnell, the Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC, who said she was averaging about four hours of sleep a night. ''A lot of kids ask, which is interesting.''
One such visitor, Luke Stancil, 13, the chairman of the Teenage Republicans of Johnston County, N.C., had many questions and thoughts about the debt crisis during a trip to Washington last week.
While waiting to see Mr. Paul with a group of other teenage Republicans in the Cannon House Office Building on Thursday, Luke said that although he liked conservatives affiliated with the Tea Party, he felt that in the interest of the country they should support Mr. Boehner's bill to raise the debt ceiling.
''That's all they have now,'' he said soberly. (Mr. Boehner ended up postponing the vote because of a lack of conservative support, but a modified bill was passed on Friday before it was killed later that day in the Senate.)
Meanwhile, weighing in from Chicago was its newly elected mayor, Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's incendiary former White House chief of staff, who, had he been in his old job, would have been engaged in hand-to-hand combat on Capitol Hill.
''I just passed four bills today, so I'm very happy,'' Mr. Emanuel reported. Well, what did he make of what was going on in Washington? ''My basic point is, look, your country requires you to take responsibility and understand what an honest compromise is,'' he said. He declined to answer a question about whether he missed the capital.
At the Old Ebbitt Grill, across the street from the Treasury Department, Cory Carlson, a 27-year-old account executive for the EMC Corporation, a technology giant, was at the bar on Thursday with friends. Asked about the chaos on Capitol Hill, Mr. Carlson said that the health of the economy depended on Congress raising the debt limit and that he was worried about his investments. ''Don't get me started,'' he said.
In front of the Treasury building on Friday, Margaret McCoy, a 64-year-old Democrat visiting from Pembroke, N.C., said she was worried, too -- about her government disability checks.
''I'm fed up with it, just fed up with it,'' she said, referring to the battle in Congress. ''If their checks were cut like they said ours might be cut, I wonder how they would feel.''
She looked toward the White House and saw a knot of demonstrators. Were they protesting the debt crisis, she wondered, a note of hope in her voice.
Actually, no. The demonstrators were celebrating a White House visit by President Alpha Conde, considered Guinea's first democratically elected leader. (A separate Guinean group was also protesting the visit. The street outside the White House is a busy place.)
The Guineans in the pro-Conde group said they were astonished by the debt crisis and the chaos on Capitol Hill. ''It's crazy, it's just crazy,'' said Noumouke Cisse, 57, a taxi driver from New Haven. ''They are the world leaders, you know? We are very surprised they continue to fight each other.''

HEADLINE: Rightward Tilt Leaves Obama With Party Rift

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Binyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- However the debt limit showdown ends, one thing is clear: under pressure from Congressional Republicans, President Obama has moved rightward on budget policy, deepening a rift within his party heading into the next election.
Entering a campaign that is shaping up as an epic clash over the parties' divergent views on the size and role of the federal government, Republicans have changed the terms of the national debate. Mr. Obama, seeking to appeal to the broad swath of independent voters, has adopted the Republicans' language and in some cases their policies, while signaling a willingness to break with liberals on some issues.
That has some progressive members of Congress and liberal groups arguing that by not fighting for more stimulus spending, Mr. Obama could be left with an economy still producing so few jobs by Election Day that his re-election could be threatened. Besides turning off independents, Mr. Obama risks alienating Democratic voters already disappointed by his escalation of the war in Afghanistan and his failure to close the Guantanamo Bay prison, end the Bush-era tax cuts and enact a government-run health insurance system.
''The activist liberal base will support Obama because they're terrified of the right wing,'' said Robert L. Borosage, co-director of the liberal group Campaign for America's Future. 
But he said, ''I believe that the voting base of the Democratic Party -- young people, single women, African-Americans, Latinos -- are going to be so discouraged by this economy and so dismayed unless the president starts to champion a jobs program and take on the Republican Congress that the ability of labor to turn out its vote, the ability of activists to mobilize that vote, is going to be dramatically reduced.''
While Mr. Obama and Republicans have been unable to agree on a debt reduction plan for spending cuts and revenue increases to cut $4 trillion in the first decade, on Saturday they were negotiating a deal with fewer spending cuts that would ensure the government's debt ceiling would be increased into 2013 to avoid another deadlock in the heat of campaign season.
No matter how the immediate issue is resolved, Mr. Obama, in his failed effort for greater deficit reduction, has put on the table far more in reductions for future years' spending, including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, than he did in new revenue from the wealthy and corporations. He proposed fewer cuts in military spending and more in health care than a bipartisan Senate group that includes one of the chamber's most conservative Republicans.
To win approval of the essential increase in the nation's $14.3 trillion borrowing ceiling, Mr. Obama sought more in deficit reduction than Republicans did, and with fewer changes to the entitlement programs, because he was willing to raise additional revenue starting in 2013 and they were not. And despite unemployment lingering at its highest level in decades, Mr. Obama has not fought this year for a big jobs program with billions of dollars for public-works projects, which liberals in his party have clamored for. Instead, he wants to extend a temporary payroll tax cut for everyone, since Republicans will support tax cuts, despite studies showing that spending programs are generally the more effective stimulus.
Even before last November's election gave the Republicans control of the House, Mr. Obama had said he would pivot to deficit reduction after two years of stimulus measures intended first to rescue the economy and then to spur a recovery from the near collapse of the financial system. With Republicans' gains in the midterm elections, that pivot became a lurch. Yet Congressional Republicans say Mr. Obama seeks a debt limit increase as ''a blank check'' to keep spending.
''The Republicans won, and they don't know how to accept victory,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
In his budget proposal in January, Mr. Obama declined to suggest a plan along the lines proposed by a majority of his bipartisan fiscal commission, which in December recommended $4 trillion in savings over 10 years through cuts in military and domestic programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and a tax code overhaul to lower rates while also raising more revenue.
Even though Mr. Obama was widely criticized, administration officials said at the time that to have embraced that approach then would have put him too far to the right -- where he ultimately wanted to end up in any compromise with Republicans, not where he wanted to start.
But by this month, in ultimately unsuccessful talks with Speaker John A. Boehner, Mr. Obama tentatively agreed to a plan that was farther to the right than that of the majority of the fiscal commission and a bipartisan group of senators, the so-called Gang of Six. It also included a slow rise in the Medicare eligibility age to 67 from 65, and, after 2015, a change in the formula for Social Security cost-of-living adjustments long sought by economists.
''He's accommodated himself to the new reality in Washington,'' said Tom Davis, a former House Republican leader from Virginia. ''That's what leaders do.''
But Congressional Democrats and liberal groups objected.
''The president's proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare has the potential to sap the energy of the Democratic base -- among older voters because of Medicare and Medicaid and younger voters because of the lack of jobs,'' said Damon A. Silvers, policy director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''And second, all these fiscal austerity proposals on the table will make the economy worse.''
Mr. Obama's situation has parallels with the mid-1990s, when President Bill Clinton shifted to the center after Republicans took Congress and battled them on deficit reduction and a welfare overhaul. Many Democrats were angered by his concessions, by a sense of being left out of negotiations and by a fear of alienating Democratic voters. Mr. Clinton was re-elected in 1996.
But Mr. Obama is likely to face the voters with a weaker economy and higher unemployment than during Mr. Clinton's era. Still, his advisers express confidence that voters will reward Mr. Obama either for winning a bipartisan deal, if that were to happen, or for at least having a more balanced approach that does not remake Medicare and Medicaid and asks for more revenue from the wealthy. And they suggest another potential parallel with the Clinton years of divided government: that Republicans risk a voter backlash with their uncompromising stands.
''Democrats created Social Security and Medicare, and we have fought for decades against Republican attempts to end these programs,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, Mr. Obama's communications director. ''And President Obama believes that now is the time for Democrats to be the ones to step up and save Social Security and Medicare.''
Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said polling data showed that at this point in his term, Mr. Obama, compared with past Democratic presidents, was doing as well or better with Democratic voters. ''Whatever qualms or questions they may have about this policy or that policy, at the end of the day the one thing they're absolutely certain of -- they're going to hate these Republican candidates,'' Mr. Mellman said. ''So I'm not honestly all that worried about a solid or enthusiastic base.''

HEADLINE: Can These Guys Make You 'Bing'?

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
BELLEVUE, Wash.
MIKE NICHOLS has a poster on his office wall. It shows the young Muhammad Ali glaring down at a fallen Sonny Liston, the bruising heavyweight who had seemed invincible -- until Ali beat him, in 1964, in one of the biggest upsets in sports history, and then beat him again a year later.
''The triumphant underdog,'' Mr. Nichols says, nodding toward the wall.
The inspirational fight poster is fitting, because Mr. Nichols, a general manager at Microsoft, is a lieutenant in an underdog corporate army here. Its daunting mission is to take on the Google juggernaut. 
Microsoft's assault on Google in Internet search and search advertising may be the steepest competitive challenge in business today. It is certainly among the most costly. Trying to go head-to-head with Google costs Microsoft upward of $5 billion a year, industry executives and analysts estimate.
As the overwhelming search leader, Google has advantages that tend to reinforce one another. It has the most people typing in searches -- billions a day -- and that generates more data for Google's algorithms to mine to improve its search results. All those users attract advertisers. And there is the huge behavioral advantage: ''Google'' is synonymous with search, the habitual choice.
Once it starts, this cycle of prosperity snowballs -- more users, more data, and more ad dollars. Economists call the phenomenon ''network effects''; business executives just call it momentum. In search, Google has it in spades, and Microsoft, against the odds, wants to reverse it.
Microsoft has gained some ground. Its Bing search site has steadily picked up traffic since its introduction two years ago, accounting for more than 14 percent of searches in the American market, according to comScore. Add the searches that Microsoft handles for Yahoo, in a partnership begun last year, and Microsoft's search technology fields 30 percent of the total.
Yet those gains have not come at the expense of Google. Its two-thirds share of the market in the United States -- Google claims an even higher share in many foreign markets -- has remained unchanged in the last two years. The share losers have been Yahoo and smaller search players.
The costs for Microsoft, meanwhile, keep mounting. In the latest fiscal year, ended in June, the online services division -- mainly the search business -- lost $2.56 billion. The unit's revenue rose 15 percent, to $2.53 billion, but the losses still exceeded the revenue.
Microsoft is a big, rich company. But investors are growing restless at the cost of its search campaign. In May, when David Einhorn, the hedge fund manager, called for Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's C.E.O., to be replaced, he pointed to the online unit as a particular sore spot.
Qi Lu, president of Microsoft's online services division, sees the situation this way: ''To break through, we have to change the game. But this is a long-term journey.''
MR. LU, 49, knows about long journeys -- and persistence. His grandparents raised him in rural China, in a home without running water or electricity. A bright student, he won a scholarship to the doctoral program at Carnegie Mellon.
After stints at the Almaden Research Center of I.B.M. and at Yahoo, where he was in charge of its search and search ad technology, he joined Microsoft at the end of 2008. He was recruited by Mr. Ballmer, who assured him that Microsoft was committed to search and competing with Google for the long haul.
Paul Yiu came from Yahoo two years ago, impressed by Microsoft's approach to competing in search. A business and product manager, Mr. Yiu had spent most of his career in Silicon Valley, often working for Microsoft adversaries like Netscape and Oracle.
He explains that in the valley, with its job-hopping and start-up culture, there is a ''renters' mentality'': if things aren't working out, just move on. At Microsoft, he says, there is a ''homeowners' mentality'': a dedication to making things work.
''If you're in the expensive search game, you need to have a homeowners' mentality,'' Mr. Yiu says.
Microsoft's leadership knew years ago that becoming a real competitor to Google would take patience as well as dollars. In 2007, Mr. Ballmer met with Harry Shum, a computer scientist who led Microsoft's research lab in Beijing at the time. Mr. Ballmer, as Mr. Shum recalls, told him that the company wanted to make a concerted push in search and bring in leading technical experts and business managers.
''You spent 10 years in research, and now you'll spend the next 10 years in search,'' he remembers Mr. Ballmer saying to him.
When Mr. Lu and Mr. Shum, another Ph.D. graduate of Carnegie Mellon, talk of changing the game, they mean making search smarter. Today's search, they say, primarily finds topics, or noun phrases -- a person's name, a city, a product, a disease and so on.
''Search is still essentially a Web site finder.'' Mr. Lu says. ''It's all nouns. But the future of search is verbs -- computationally discerning user intent to give them the knowledge to complete tasks.''
The phrase that Microsoft uses is ''decision engine,'' as opposed to search engine.
New classes of information will help. Social network data, for example. Microsoft has an exclusive partnership with Facebook, and in May it included a feature for linking the ''Like'' tags of a person's Facebook friends to that person's search results in Bing. It might show, say, that 15 of your Facebook friends ''liked'' a certain restaurant. It is a first step, Mr. Lu says, in including trusted opinions in search -- and not just the popular ones that conventional search does so well.
Location data, especially from the growing share of searches on smartphones, offers another rich stream of information. If the engine knows where you are, it can add another layer of context and knowledge to the search.
The ability to write increasingly responsive, full-featured applications for the Web -- using the new HTML5 programming language -- should also make search more intelligent. The goal, Mr. Lu says, is that someday you will speak a phrase into your smartphone -- ''dinner for two on Friday and movie after'' -- and the software will go to work. It will connect to your personal data -- your location, your dining and film preferences. It will then connect to dining and restaurant reservation applications, like Yelp and OpenTable, and movie reservation applications like Fandango.
Then the engine will begin a dialogue: ''Here's what is available. Where would you like to eat and when?''
In short, Mr. Lu describes a vision of a search engine that is part intelligent software assistant and part mind reader.
In Bing, the most visible evidence of the decision-engine concept is the ability to aggregate and present specific kinds of information in a search result. Microsoft has invested in travel services, for example. Type ''flights to San Francisco'' into Bing, and below a few blue-shaded links to ads is a Bing Travel flight database. Click on departure and return dates, and it performs a full search of all flights and predicts whether the fare is likely to rise or fall in the days before the departure date. That feature is based on technology from Farecast, a start-up that Microsoft bought for $115 million in 2008.
Bing also uses technology from MedStory, a health search engine it bought four years ago for an undisclosed price, to pull together information from across the Web and present it in an on-screen box above the conventional search links. Type in ''diabetes,'' and the gray-shaded information box contains a short definition from the Mayo Clinic, along with a link to the full article. Just below are links to diabetes articles from other professional health publications. Next come links to four related conditions, like high blood pressure and obesity, and four to related medications. At the bottom are links to recent Twitter posts about diabetes.
Technology experts agree that Bing is making innovative strides. ''There is so little context in current search, and what Microsoft is trying to do is present users with context and structure, more a map of the world of information instead of just ranking it, especially in specific subject areas like travel and health,'' says Esther Dyson, an investor in start-ups and a longtime technology analyst. ''Microsoft is trying to beat Google at this different game.''
But while Microsoft may be ahead in some facets, Google is innovating as well -- and acquiring specialized technology to fold into its search engine. In April, the Justice Department approved Google's $700 million purchase of ITA Software, which collects and organizes online data for airline flights. Last year, Google paid an undisclosed sum for MetaWeb, a start-up that used a vast database to better decipher the meaning, and not just the words, of search queries. In 2008, Microsoft paid an estimated $100 million for Powerset, a start-up that is also a specialist in so-called semantic search technology.
''Both these companies are making important steps to make search more intelligent,'' says Oren Etzioni, a computer scientist at the University of Washington. ''It's an arms race.''
At Google, the Microsoft talk of a ''decision engine'' is regarded as a clever turn of phrase that merely describes the long-range ambition of search and information retrieval, as the field was called in the years before the Internet.
''The goal has always been the same,'' explains Amit Singhal, a computer scientist who leads Google's search team. ''The progression is from data to useful information to knowledge that answers questions people have or helps them do things. Knowledge is the quest.''
IT'S a Wednesday morning in June, and Brian MacDonald is presiding over back-to-back product meetings for Bing.
Mr. MacDonald, 49 and a vice president, is a returnee to Microsoft. His first stint began in 1989, when Microsoft acquired a business software company he co-founded; he stayed on, managing the development of a series of programs in Microsoft's lucrative Office business until 2001. In those 12 years, Microsoft's share price soared, and stock options for managers yielded the kind of personal wealth that opened up life choices. He left, invested in a few start-ups, spent time with his young children. But his children became teenagers and the appeal of dabbling in start-ups faded, and he was lured back to Microsoft in 2007, when, he says, the company was finally becoming ''focused and serious about search.''
The meetings are in a sixth-floor conference room in an office complex here in Bellevue, a Seattle suburb. (Most Bing employees work in Bellevue, needing more space than was available at the headquarters campus in Redmond.) Each meeting involves about a half-dozen designers and engineers ranging in age from the late 20s to 40s. A few others join in by phone and videoconference from Silicon Valley and India.
The first session focuses on software still in the concept stage, called Bing DeskBar. It is downloadable software for personal computers, and perhaps for smartphones and tablets. The DeskBar, in the early June prototype, sorts information by categories like people, documents and Web sites. It presents information in those categories in large on-screen icons, or tiles, and sorts data by what is most ''recent, relevant and frequently used,'' as one designer says.
The people feature, for example, sorts through communications including e-mail, Facebook and Twitter messages. The idea is to filter messages according to computed criteria -- like those from your work colleagues, or from people you communicate with most often.
DeskBar is one of several experimental projects in the larger Bing strategy, Mr. MacDonald explains later. ''You take a product category, you expand it and you own that expanded category,'' he says. ''We have a recipe.''
That is the formula that worked in the past for Microsoft in PC software, with Windows and Office. But whether that game plan will work against Google is uncertain at best.
The second meeting focuses on design tweaks in Bing's next wave of improvements, which would be released into the search engine a few weeks later. The upgrades have come in six-month cycles since the preparations for Bing's introduction in May 2009.
Each cycle is named for a city. First was Kiev, then Oslo, Boston and Denver. A recent upgrade was called Mountain View, for the Silicon Valley town where Google is based. The next three cycles will be named for rock bands formed in West Coast cities, gradually moving closer to Microsoft's base: Metallica (Los Angeles), Nirvana (Aberdeen, Wash.) and Soundgarden (Seattle).
''We're bringing it back here,'' Mr. MacDonald says.
Witty code names aside, Bing has a long way to go. It is praised for improvements in search quality and features that distinguish it from Google, including its stylish home page -- a different and striking picture each day, typically of a place, plant or animal, with four links to information about the subject that appear when a computer cursor passes over the image.
Advertisers have noticed Bing's progress. Laura Desmond, C.E.O. of Starcom MediaVest, an ad strategy and placement agency, says Microsoft's share of its corporate clients' click volume from search ads has grown to 24 percent, from 14 percent, in the last nine months or so.
''Bing is clearly behind Google, but now it's a scale player as well,'' Ms. Desmond says.
Becoming a solid No. 2 behind Google is an accomplishment, but at what cost? Yusuf Mehdi, a Microsoft senior vice president, declined to say when the company planned to break even in search. The huge reported losses, he says, are a result of aggressive investment over the last few years to hire people and build data centers that can handle 30 percent to 40 percent of search traffic, first in the United States and later in other markets. Those upfront, fixed costs are enormous, Mr. Mehdi acknowledges, but once Microsoft's search traffic and ad volumes rise, the financial picture could brighten quickly.
''As we grow share,'' he says, ''that really can drive the profitability, and that's the key for us to turn to profitability and then grow beyond.''
Microsoft is not yet translating its search traffic -- that 30 percent share in the United States, including the Yahoo partnership -- into comparable ad dollars. Revenue per search from Yahoo traffic it handles is far less than it was when Yahoo managed its own search ads, Yahoo said in its recent earnings report. But Microsoft and Yahoo executives say the shortfall is temporary, a result of making a complex technology switch while a business is running.
''It's a matter of time and effort, not an inability to do it,'' says Mark Morrissey, a Yahoo senior vice president. ''I'm as confident of the economic payoff from this partnership as I was on Day 1.''
IF those tech teething problems can be solved, the big remaining challenge will be attracting more traffic at Google's expense. At this stage, says Mr. MacDonald at Microsoft, the greatest hurdle for Bing is the habitual behavior that works to Google's advantage.
''For most people, Google is search -- they go to Google without even thinking about it,'' he says. ''We've got to develop our own habits, of people trying Bing.''
Yes, says Mr. Singhal at Google, user habits are a powerful force that help his company. Those habits, he adds, result from Google's doing so well for so long.
''Those habits are earned with trust over the years,'' he says.
Still, there may be an opening for Microsoft, underdog that it is. Charlene Li, founder of the Altimeter Group, a tech research firm, calls herself a ''huge Google user'' who turns to its search engine many times a day. ''It takes a lot to move me out of Google,'' she says.
Yet Ms. Li says she now uses Bing for travel -- finding airline flights -- and sometimes to search for restaurants, too.
''Microsoft's best hope is that it gets more and more people to migrate to Bing for specific tasks like travel,'' she says. ''Then, if they like what they see, they may use Bing more broadly.''

Bing is trying new approaches to distinguish itself from Google, as shown in their comparable search results for ''diabetes.'' The Bing search, at left, yields an onscreen box combining a Mayo Clinic definition with links to articles, Twitter posts and information on related conditions.
 In contrast to Google's sparse home-page design, Bing, top left, offers a different picture each day, with links to information about the subject that appear when a computer cursor passes over the image. Both Bing and Google are collecting and analyzing airline data, so that a search for New York-San Francisco flights, above, produces more than simple links. Bing's search, left, offers a tool for finding specific flights, while Google has a link to a full schedule. (BU5)

HEADLINE: What's With All the Bernanke Bashing?

BYLINE: By N. GREGORY MANKIW. 
N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard. He is advising Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, in the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.

 BODY:
POOR Ben Bernanke.
He left a comfortable professorship at Princeton to run the Federal Reserve -- and this is what he gets.
Mr. Bernanke has worked tirelessly to shepherd the economy through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and yet, for all his efforts, seems vastly underappreciated.
CNBC recently asked people, ''Do you have confidence in the way Ben Bernanke is handling the economy?'' Ninety-five percent of the respondents said no. 
Yes, the CNBC survey was hardly scientific. Nonetheless, it reflected the deep unease that many Americans feel about our central bank and its policies. Critics on both the left and right see much to dislike in how Mr. Bernanke and his Fed colleagues have been doing their jobs.
Let's review the complaints.
Critics on the left look at the depth of the recent recession and the meager economic recovery we are experiencing and argue that the Fed should have done more. They fear that the United States might slip into a long malaise akin to Japan's lost decade, in which unemployment remains high and the risks of deflation deter people from borrowing, investing and returning the economy to its potential.
Critics on the right, meanwhile, worry that the Fed has increased the nation's monetary base at a historically unprecedented pace while keeping interest rates near zero -- an approach that they say will eventually ignite inflation. Some in this camp have gone so far as to propose repealing the Fed's dual mandate of simultaneously maintaining price stability -- that is, holding inflation at bay -- while maximizing sustainable employment. Better, these people say, to replace those twin goals with a single-minded focus on inflation.
Yet Mr. Bernanke's record shows that the fears of both sides have been exaggerated.
Mr. Bernanke became the Fed chairman in February 2006. Since then, the inflation measure favored by the Fed -- the price index for personal consumption, excluding food and energy -- has averaged 1.9 percent, annualized. A broader price index that includes food and energy has averaged 2.1 percent.
Either way, the outcome is remarkably close to the Fed's unofficial inflation target of 2 percent. So, despite the economic turmoil of the last five years, the Fed has kept inflation on track.
Of course, this record could come undone in future years. Yet the signals in the financial markets are reassuring. The interest rate on a 10-year Treasury bond, for instance, is now about 2.8 percent. A 10-year inflation-protected Treasury bond yields about 0.4 percent.
The difference between those yields, the so-called ''break-even inflation rate,'' is the inflation rate at which the two bonds earn the same return. That figure is now a bit over 2 percent, a sign that the market does not expect inflation in the coming decade to differ much from that experienced over the last five years. Inflation expectations are anchored at close to their target rate.
Could the Fed have done substantially more to avoid the recession and promote recovery? Probably not. The Fed used its main weapon against recession -- cuts in short-term interest rates -- aggressively as the depth of the downturn became apparent. And it turned to various unconventional weapons as well, including two rounds of quantitative easing -- essentially buying bonds -- in an attempt to lower long-term interest rates.
A few economists have argued, with some logic, that the employment picture would be brighter if the Fed raised its target for inflation above 2 percent. They say higher expected inflation would lower real interest rates, thus encouraging borrowing. That, in turn, would expand the aggregate demand for goods and services. With more demand for their products, companies would increase hiring.
Even if that were true, a higher inflation target is a political nonstarter. Economists are divided about whether a higher target makes sense, and the public would likely oppose a more rapidly rising cost of living. If Chairman Bernanke ever suggested increasing inflation to, say, 4 percent, he would quickly return to being Professor Bernanke.
What the Fed could do, however, is codify its projected price path of 2 percent. That is, the Fed could announce that, hereafter, it would aim for a price level that rises 2 percent a year. And it would promise to pursue policies to get back to the target price path if shocks to the economy ever pushed the actual price level away from it.
Such an announcement could help mollify critics on both the left and right. If we started to see the Japanese-style deflation that the left fears, the Fed would maintain a loose monetary policy and even allow a bit of extra inflation to make up for past tracking errors. If we faced the high inflation that worries the right, the Fed would be committed to raising interest rates aggressively to bring inflation back on target.
MORE important, an announced target path for inflation would add more certainty to the economy. Americans planning their retirement would have a better sense about the cost of living a decade or two hence. Companies borrowing in the bond market could more accurately pin down the real cost of financing their investment projects.
Mr. Bernanke cannot remove all of the uncertainty that households and businesses face, but he can eliminate one small piece of it. Less uncertainty would, other things being equal, encourage spending and promote more rapid recovery. It might even raise Mr. Bernanke's approval ratings a bit.

HEADLINE: U.S. Report Says Iraq Still Plagued by Corruption, Security and Electricity Troubles

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT; Yasir Ghazi and Zaid Thaker contributed reporting from Baghdad, and an employee of The New York Times from Diyala Province, Iraq.

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- Over the past year, security in Iraq has deteriorated and electricity shortages and corruption have continued unabated, according to a report released Saturday by a special inspector appointed by Congress to oversee Iraq's reconstruction. 
The report, released five months before the United States is scheduled to withdraw 47,000 troops from Iraq, paints a bleaker picture of the country's stability than assessments by diplomatic officials.
''Iraq remains an extraordinarily dangerous place to work,'' said Stuart W. Bowen Jr., who has run the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction since its creation in 2004.
''Buttressing this conclusion is the fact that June was the deadliest month for U.S. troops in more than two years,'' he added. ''Shia militias -- possibly armed and trained by Iran -- were responsible for some of the lethal attacks.''
In particular, Mr. Bowen said that Diyala Province, a region east of Baghdad that is one of the most violent battlegrounds for sectarian violence, remained unstable. He added that local officials were extremely pessimistic about security and the economy.
''In July meetings about the security situation the province's chief prosecutor remarked that every time he steps outside his house, it 'is a walk into the unknown,' '' the report said.
There have been several significant attacks in Diyala in recent months. And on Saturday, at least nine civilians were wounded in two separate attacks in the province, local security officials said.
The report said that Iraqis had significantly increased their use of electricity over the past two years but that the supply had remained the same and significant power shortages continued. Investigators looking into corruption by the Iraqi government ''remain stymied by political resistance and lack of capacity and have difficulty pursuing cases involving complex crimes and high-level officials,'' the report said.
It also offered a cautious view of State Department plans for Iraq's development, mentioning that the training of the Iraqi police force ''will be challenging,'' in part because it will include only 200 advisers based at three sites across the country's 10 provinces.
Reiterating statements Mr. Bowen made earlier this year, the report said that State Department officials had thwarted his office's attempts to audit the program. A State Department spokesman in Washington declined comment; department officials have contended that Mr. Bowen's office does not have jurisdiction over their operations after Oct. 1.
Some Iraqi officials in Baghdad objected to the report's assessment of their country's security situation. ''The report is exaggerated,'' said Hussain al-Asadi, a member of Parliament from Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki's State of Law bloc. ''There are failures and shortcomings in the government and the security forces, but it is not as bad as the report says it is.''
He added, ''Such reports have meaning inside America, but in Iraq it has no impact.''
Also on Saturday, Mr. Maliki gave a speech before Parliament about shrinking the Iraqi government. Mr. Maliki had been under pressure to reduce the budget in response to protests in February calling for a more accountable government. After the speech, Parliament voted to eliminate 14 departments, including the ministers of state for marshes, tribal affairs and Parliament affairs.

HEADLINE: Amid New Talks, Some Optimism On Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Reporting was contributed by Jackie Calmes, Helene Cooper, Binyamin Appelbaum and Robert Pear from Washington, and Thom Shanker from Kandahar, Afghanistan.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- New budget talks between top Congressional Republicans and President Obama made progress late Saturday, suddenly stirring optimism that a last-minute deal could be reached to avert a potential federal default that threatened significant economic and political consequences.
After a tense day of Congressional floor fights and angry exchanges, Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, called off a planned showdown vote set for after midnight, but said he would convene the Senate at noon on Sunday for a vote an hour later. He said he wanted to give the new negotiations a chance to produce a plan to raise the federal debt limit in exchange for spending cuts and the creation of a new Congressional committee that would try to assemble a long-range deficit-cutting proposal.
''There are many elements to be finalized and there is still a distance to go before an arrangement can be completed,'' said Mr. Reid, who just a few hours earlier had played down talk of any agreement. ''But I believe we should give everyone as much room as possible to do their work.'' 
Mr. Reid's announcement set off an almost audible sigh of relief on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers and their aides had been bracing for an overnight clash over the debt following a day that had seen a heated House vote and lawmakers trudging from office to office in search of an answer to the impasse.
The first indication off a softening of the hard lines that have marked weeks of partisan wrangling over the debt limit came in the afternoon when the two leading Congressional Republicans announced that they had reopened fiscal talks with the White House and expected their last-ditch drive to produce a compromise.
Following the House's sharp rejection of a proposal by Mr. Reid to raise the debt limit and cut spending, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader and a linchpin in efforts to reach a deal, said he and Speaker John A. Boehner were ''now fully engaged'' in efforts with the White House to find a resolution that would tie an increase in the debt limit to spending cuts and other conditions.
''I'm confident and optimistic that we're going to get an agreement in the very near future and resolve this crisis in the best interests of the American people,'' said Mr. McConnell, who noted he was personally talking to both Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a favorite partner in past negotiations.
Mr. Boehner, who would have to steer a compromise through the House, said he based his confidence on the prospect of an agreement on the sense that ''we're dealing with reasonable, responsible people who want this crisis to end as quickly as possible.''
A Democratic official with knowledge of the talks said that Mr. McConnell called Mr. Biden early Saturday afternoon, the first conversation between the two men since Wednesday. The official said they talked at least four more times on Saturday as they tried to work out an agreement.
The deal they were discussing, this person said, resembled the bill that Mr. Boehner won approval for in the House on Friday more than it did the one that Mr. Reid had proposed.
It would immediately raise the debt ceiling by about $1 trillion, accompanied by a similar range of spending cuts, and set up a new bipartisan committee that would work to find deeper cuts in exchange for a second debt limit increase that would extend through the 2012 election.
A failure of the new committee to win enactment of its proposal could then set off automatic spending cuts across the board, including to entitlement programs. Other ideas were swirling around the Capitol as lawmakers searched for a way to avoid default. One of Mr. Reid's top lieutenants said he saw at least a glimmer of hope.
''We are a long way from any sort of negotiated agreement,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, ''but there is certainly a more positive feeling about reaching an agreement than I've felt in a long time.''
The flurry of activity came as anxiety built up in many corners, including among Wall Street investors worried about the effects on the markets and active-duty soldiers worried about their paychecks.
After Mr. McConnell sounded a hopeful note, Mr. Reid called members of the Senate to the floor to hear him dispute the claims by his Republican counterpart and accuse Republicans of failing to enter into serious negotiations even as the Treasury risked running out of money to pay all its bills after Tuesday.
''The speaker and Republican leader should know that merely saying you have an agreement in front of television cameras doesn't make it so,'' Mr. Reid said after returning from a visit to the White House with Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader in the House.
Trying to build momentum for his own proposal, Mr. Reid and fellow Democrats were working to win over Republican senators to support his plan to raise the debt ceiling through 2012 and circumvent Mr. McConnell.
''Americans are watching us and demanding a result that is balanced,'' Mr. Reid said.
The Senate Democrats' efforts were set back Saturday when 43 of the 47 Republican senators signed a letter to Mr. Reid saying they would not back his proposal, which would allow a $2.4 trillion increase in the debt ceiling in two stages while establishing a new Congressional committee to explore deeper spending cuts. The numbers signaled that without changes in the plan, Mr. Reid would not be able to overcome a Republican filibuster, which requires 60 votes.
House Republicans signaled their disapproval of the Reid plan by holding a symbolic vote on Saturday, rejecting it by a 246 to 173 vote, in a move intended to show it had no chance of passing in that chamber. About a dozen Democrats joined Republicans in rejecting the Reid plan.
The pre-emptive vote could strengthen Mr. McConnell's hand as he seeks to shape any final compromise.
At the White House and in talks in Congressional offices and corridors, most of the attention was focused on finding a way to define the precise conditions under which the president could get a second increase in the debt limit that would be needed early in 2012 under both Republican and Democratic proposals. Officials in both parties said another idea that had surfaced was to require a change in Social Security policy if the new committee deadlocked, providing an incentive for the new committee to act on its own.
Under the proposal that the Congressional Budget Office said could save more than $100 billion over 10 years, a different measure of inflation would be used to calculate the annual cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security benefits. Supporters say the alternative measure of inflation is more accurate because it reflects what happens when prices rise; advocates for the elderly say the proposal is a backdoor way of cutting benefits.
Members of both parties took the floor to push for compromise, noting that the two sides were not far apart on major elements of their deficit-reduction plans.
''Failure should not be an option for us in this case, and it's time we started finding common ground,'' said Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia.
The unusual Saturday session came after a week of brinkmanship on Capitol Hill. On Friday, Mr. Boehner managed to pass his own House bill, along party lines, just a day after suspending the vote as the Republican leadership tried frantically to line up enough votes for passage. But the Senate swiftly rejected that plan late Friday.
While some of the back-and-forth between the House and Senate and the party leaders was typical of the late stages of a negotiation, the combative and unyielding tone in both chambers of Congress was creating more pessimism in the rank and file about the prospects that a final agreement could be struck and cleared before Tuesday.
Even if a measure is able to win significant bipartisan endorsement in the Senate, the reception in the House could be different with the Treasury Department's Tuesday deadline for increasing the debt limit at hand. But how to push a plan by House conservatives remained a major question mark.
At the Treasury Department, Secretary Timothy F. Geithner met with top advisers on Saturday on contingency plans for managing the financial consequences of Congressional inaction. ''No one will be pleased,'' said one adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The Treasury Department calculates that the government will exhaust its ability to borrow money at the end of Tuesday, forcing the government to pay its bills from a dwindling pile of cash. Independent analysts estimate the government has enough money on hand to pay all of its bills for another week, more or less, before it starts missing payments.
Mr. Obama has repeatedly called on Congress to raise the borrowing limit, known as the debt ceiling, by Tuesday to avoid any uncertainty about the government's ability to meet its obligations. Financial markets are particularly concerned about the payment of interest on the federal debt. A default on those obligations could precipitate a global financial crisis.
The painful negotiations to resolve the crisis have caught the attention of troops in Afghanistan, where Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was quizzed repeatedly on Saturday by soldiers and Marines worried about their paychecks.
In Kandahar and Helmand Provinces, Admiral Mullen said it remained uncertain where money would be found if the government defaulted. Regardless of budget talks in Washington, the mission for American troops in Afghanistan would not halt, he said.
''We're going to continue to come to work,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Why Voters Tune Out Democrats

BYLINE: By STANLEY B. GREENBERG. 
The chief executive of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, a polling company that works with center-left political parties in the United States and abroad.

 BODY:
Stanley B. Greenberg is the chief executive of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, a polling company that works with center-left political parties in the United States and abroad.
BARACK OBAMA can't catch a break from the American public on the economy, even though he prevented a depression and saved global capitalism.
Perhaps the president finds solace in knowing he's not alone. During this period of economic crisis and uncertainty, voters are generally turning to conservative and right-wing political parties, most notably in Europe and in Canada.
It's perplexing. When unemployment is high, and the rich are getting richer, you would think that voters of average means would flock to progressives, who are supposed to have their interests in mind -- and who historically have delivered for them. 
During the last half-century or so, when a Democratic president has led the country, people have tended to experience lower unemployment, less inequality and rising income compared with periods of Republican governance. There is a reason, however, that many voters in the developed world are turning away from Democrats, Socialists, liberals and progressives.
My vantage point on voter behavior comes through my company, Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, and its work for center-left parties globally, starting with Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992. For the last decade, I have worked in partnership with James Carville conducting monthly polls digging into America's mood and studying how progressives can develop successful electoral strategies. (I am also married to a Democratic congresswoman from Connecticut, Rosa L. DeLauro.)
In analyzing these polls in the United States, I see clearly that voters feel ever more estranged from government -- and that they associate Democrats with government. If Democrats are going to be encumbered by that link, they need to change voters' feelings about government. They can recite their good plans as a mantra and raise their voices as if they had not been heard, but voters will not listen to them if government is disreputable.
Oddly, many voters prefer the policies of Democrats to the policies of Republicans. They just don't trust the Democrats to carry out those promises.
When we conducted our election-night national survey after last year's Republican sweep, voters strongly chose new investment over a new national austerity. They thought Democrats were more likely to champion the middle class. And as has become clear in the months since, the public does not share conservatives' views on rejecting tax cuts and cutting retirement programs. Numerous recent polls have shown that the public sides with the president and Democrats on raising taxes to get to a balanced budget.
But in smaller, more probing focus groups, voters show they are fairly cynical about Democratic politicians' stands. They tune out the politicians' fine speeches and plans and express sentiments like these: ''It's just words.'' ''There's just such a control of government by the wealthy that whatever happens, it's not working for all the people; it's working for a few of the people.'' ''We don't have a representative government anymore.''
This distrust of government and politicians is unfolding as a full-blown crisis of legitimacy sidelines Democrats and liberalism. Just a quarter of the country is optimistic about our system of government -- the lowest since polls by ABC and others began asking this question in 1974. But a crisis of government legitimacy is a crisis of liberalism. It doesn't hurt Republicans. If government is seen as useless, what is the point of electing Democrats who aim to use government to advance some public end?
In earlier periods, confidence in the economy and rising personal incomes put limits on voter discontent. Today, a dispiriting economy combined with a well-developed critique of government leaves government not just distrusted but illegitimate.
GOVERNMENT operates by the wrong values and rules, for the wrong people and purposes, the Americans I've surveyed believe. Government rushes to help the irresponsible and does little for the responsible. Wall Street lobbyists govern, not Main Street voters. Vexingly, this promotes both national and middle-class decline yet cannot be moved by conventional democratic politics. Lost jobs, soaring spending and crippling debt make America ever weaker, unable to meet its basic obligations to educate and protect its citizens. Yet politicians take care of themselves and party interests, while government grows remote and unresponsive, leaving people feeling powerless.
If they are to win trust, and votes, Democrats must show they are as determined as the Tea Party movement to change the rules of the game. In our surveys and media work for Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign, we found that only if people thought a candidate was going to change government in fundamental ways -- starting with welfare and reinventing government -- would they give permission to spend their money.
The same is true today. In our recent Web survey of 2,000 respondents, voters respond strongly to Democratic messages on the economy only when a party leader declares, ''We have to start by changing Washington. ... The middle class won't catch a break until we confront the power of money and the lobbyists.''
Why is that?
You do not have to look very far. If there is an article of faith among contemporary center-left leaders, it is that investment in education will pay dividends with increased productivity and increased income. And yet the evidence is piling up that the economy is not working for the middle class. Productivity and education increase but wages do not follow.
When presented with vivid descriptions of income inequality in America, people are deflated, rather than empowered to bring change. In surveys, they tell me that they think the politicians and the chief executives are ''piggybacking off each other.'' They think that the game is rigged and that the wealthy and big industries get policies that reinforce their advantage. And they do not think their voices matter.
That government and the elite appear blithely to promote globalization and economic integration, while the working population loses income, makes the frustration more intense.
Our research shows that the growth of self-identified conservatives began in the fall of 2008 with the Wall Street bailout, well before Mr. Obama embarked on his recovery and spending program. The public watched the elite and leaders of both parties rush to the rescue. The government saved irresponsible executives who bankrupted their own companies, hurt many people and threatened the welfare of the country. When Mr. Obama championed the bailout of the auto companies and allowed senior executives at bailed-out companies to take bonuses, voters concluded that he was part of the operating elite consensus. If you owned a small business that was in trouble or a home or pension that lost much of its value, you were on your own. As people across the country told me, the average citizen doesn't ''get money for free.'' Their conclusion: Government works for the irresponsible, not the responsible.
Everything they witness affirms the public's developing view of how government really works. They see a nexus of money and power, greased by special interest lobbyists and large campaign donations, that makes these outcomes irresistible. They do not believe the fundamentals have really changed in Mr. Obama's Washington.
What should Democrats do?
The Democrats have to start detoxifying politics by proposing to severely limit or bar individual and corporate campaign contributions, which would mean a fight with the Supreme Court. They must make the case for public financing of campaigns and force the broadcast and cable networks to provide free time for candidate ads. And they must become the strongest advocates for transparency in campaign donations and in the lobbying of elected officials.
IF they want to win the trust of the public, Democrats should propose taxing lobbyist expenses and excessive chief executive bonuses and put a small fee on the sale of stocks, bonds and other financial instruments. By radically simplifying the tax code to allow only a few deductions, the Democrats would generate new revenue and remove the loopholes that allow special interests to win favorable treatment. The ordinary citizen, according to our surveys and focus groups, feels there is no way to play that game and views simplifying the tax code as an important reform.
To show that government can protect the nation's interests, Democrats should advocate policies that would control the borders and address problems of undocumented workers.
Dealing with this is even more important in Europe, where anti-immigrant and anti-Islamic parties are surging at the expense of the mainstream left and right parties in France, Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway, site of the recent slaughter for which an extreme right-winger has claimed responsibility.
In the face of such madness, it is tempting to view the issue as illegitimate, but mainstream parties do so at great cost. Our work in Austria and Britain shows that it is possible for progressives to champion immigration policies that protect the labor market and promote and require integration, beginning with language and schooling.
In the United States, those who advocate comprehensive immigration reform are demonstrating that they consider responsibility a primary value. My surveys show that voters want comprehensive immigration reform rather than half measures. They would like to see strong enforcement at the border and in the workplace, and the expulsion of troublesome undocumented immigrants. While favoring toughness, they also want to find ways to put undocumented workers on a path to citizenship.
These measures, if pushed by Democrats, would show that government operated by the right values. Just as Mr. Clinton's welfare reform in 1996 required efforts to make work pay and expand child care, immigration reform can show how progressives punish irresponsibility and reward responsibility.
Finally, progressives have to be serious about reducing the country's long-term deficits, constraining special interest spending and tax breaks and making government accountable to the ordinary citizen. The deficit matters to people and has real meaning and consequences. A government that spends and borrows without the kind of limits that would govern an ordinary family is going to have big troubles. Voters I've studied say things like, if ''we keep spending like this, we're going to be bankrupt and there won't be anything for anybody,'' especially ''our children.'' The final straw is the government's decision to continue spending and to put the country deeper into debt and more dependent on China.
President Obama understood this essential lesson when he decided to unveil his own plan for long-term deficit reduction. The fog of the debt-limit debate has obscured that commitment, and his determination to raise taxes on the most fortunate to reduce our indebtedness and fund his priorities. Polls show that the public is with him, scornful of the Republican demand for no tax increases. Rather than treating deficit reduction as an ''eat your peas moment,'' progressives should embrace the liberal think tanks' bold deficit plans, which would raise taxes more and defend progressive priorities.
That would be in the spirit of President Clinton's first economic plan, which used a 50-50 mix of tax increases and spending cuts to cut the deficit. That laid the groundwork for a restoration in trust in government later in the 1990s.
Recently, it has been the conservatives, the Tea Party members and the anti-immigrant groups who understand the anger with government, and rush in to exploit it. Perhaps now, with the debacle in Washington, liberals will become instinctively angry with this illegitimate government and build their politics from there.

HEADLINE: Lowering Nation's Credit Rating May Have Little Effect, Economists Suggest

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As political leaders race to avoid a default on the nation's debts by striking a deal to borrow more money, there is a growing chance that a secondary goal, preserving the nation's pristine credit rating, might slip beyond reach.
A credit downgrade would probably increase the cost of borrowing for the federal government and for everyone else. But the Obama administration, House Republicans, some economists and Wall Street strategists have concluded that the economic impact would be surprisingly modest, one reason that negotiations over a ''grand bargain'' for debt reduction broke down. 
The plans being debated instead by House Republicans and Senate Democrats would not reduce the federal debt to a level that most economists regard as manageable, and it seems likely that further efforts will await the results of the 2012 elections.
A compromise between the parties would avert the catastrophic consequences of default, but even if Congress agrees to pay its bills, one of the three credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor's, has said it may remove the United States from its list of risk-free borrowers.
''A downgrade has lots of downsides, but they're minor in comparison to not raising the debt ceiling on time, so I think the focus is correct at this point,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, a sister company to the rating agency that rates debt securities.
''What's most important is raising the debt ceiling. That's the minimum that they need to do to make sure the recovery in fact remains a recovery.''
Asked Thursday whether his plan would avoid a downgrade, House Speaker John A. Boehner said, ''That is beyond my control.'' He said the legislation, which the House passed Friday on a party-line vote, is ''as large a step as we're able to take at this point in time.''
President Obama warned Friday morning that the government was at risk of a downgrade, ''Not because we didn't have the capacity to pay our bills -- we do -- but because we didn't have a AAA political system to match our AAA credit rating.'' But administration officials say that the White House also regards the issue a secondary concern.
There was widespread alarm in Washington this month when S & P, followed by Moody's and Fitch, other credit rating concerns, warned that the soaring federal debt and the political standoff over raising the debt ceiling had placed the nation's credit rating at risk.
The federal government makes about $250 billion in interest payments a year. Even a small increase in the rates demanded by investors in United States debt could add tens of billions of dollars to those payments. And the credit rating agencies have said other downgrades would follow like dominoes.
For example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage companies that are backed by the federal government, would be downgraded, raising rates on home mortgage loans for borrowers. Maryland and Virginia, their economies tied to the government, would also be downgraded. So would New Mexico, because a high proportion of residents depend on federal benefits.
''A default on our nation's obligations, or a downgrade of America's credit rating,'' 13 financial company chief executives said on Thursday in a letter to the president and Congress, ''would be a tremendous blow to business and investor confidence -- raising interest rates for everyone who borrows, undermining the value of the dollar, and roiling stock and bond markets -- and, therefore, dramatically worsening our nation's already difficult economic circumstances.''
Still, Washington's fears of a downgrade have eased for several reasons.
Standard & Poor's warned that it might downgrade the United States in the next three months if the government did not agree on a credible plan to reduce its debts by about $4 trillion -- the number used in the talks between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner.
But the other two agencies, Moody's and Fitch, have shown greater patience, saying that progress toward paying down debts did not need to start immediately. That is significant, because a downgrade by a single rating agency matters less than a consensus.
Moody's said on Friday that it would maintain its Aaa rating for the United States so long as the Treasury keeps paying bondholders and Congress passes a long-term deal to extend the debt ceiling. The announcement said that failure to act by Tuesday night, or to meet other obligations, including Social Security payments, would not prompt a downgrade.
The company added, however, that the government still needed to produce a long-term plan to reduce its debts to avoid an eventual downgrade. ''The chances of a significant improvement in the long-term credit profile of the government coming from deficit reductions of the magnitude proposed in either plan are not high,'' Moody's said.
Concerns about a downgrade have also been eased by closer inspection of the potential consequences.
Oddly, because Treasuries have always been considered perfectly safe, many rules are written as if there were no possibility that their status would deteriorate. The federal government, in other words, does not really need a credit rating, which is reflected in the fact that it does not pay a fee to the ratings agencies, while everyone else does.
Banking regulations, for example, accord Treasuries a special status that is not contingent on their rating. Some investment funds, too, often treat Treasuries as a separate asset category, so that there is no need to sell Treasuries simply because they are no longer rated triple-A.
Also, the concerns of the ratings agencies are focused on long-term Treasury bonds, not the short-term federal debt widely held by money market mutual funds.
In other words, almost no one would be precluded from investing in federal debt, and even the ratings agencies have concluded that few investors would walk away voluntarily.
The experience of other nations that have been downgraded, including Japan and Canada, both downgraded more than a decade ago, suggests that investors do not necessarily react by demanding higher interest rates.
Finally, there is widespread skepticism that S & P will follow through on its downgrade threat.
''A downgrade of the U.S. government would, in our view, not cause that many investors to dispose of their Treasuries,'' Arnaud Mares, head of sovereign strategy at Morgan Stanley, told investors during a conference call on Thursday.
''We think it would accelerate the ongoing trend toward less reliance on ratings in regulation and investment mandates.''
''So the effect,'' he said, ''would be more on the use of ratings than on the market itself.''

HEADLINE: Tempest in A Tea Party

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
SO I was chatting with Chris Coons, the new Democratic senator from Delaware who had a rare win over the Tea Party when he beat loony Christine ''I've Dabbled in Witchcraft but I Am Not a Witch'' O'Donnell in the midterms.
Coons is a smart guy who's alarmed at finding himself in a vicious combat zone that makes ''Shark Week'' look like a guppy party. 
He said he felt as if he were in ''an alternative universe.'' He wonders if the president, rather than using an analogy about late credit card payments, should explain that failing to raise the debt ceiling is like the nation's refusing to pay its mortgage. And he glumly noted that there would be a ''bouquet of blame'' for everyone if Congress and the White House allowed the country to ''Titanic.''
''You know,'' I told the suffering senator, ''there is an easy solution.''
He looked up hopefully.
''Witchcraft,'' I beamed. ''Too bad we don't have a senator who knows some spells.''
Ancient incantations and eye of newt -- not that Newt -- would be the only way to conjure up a less embarrassing group of leaders.
The world is watching in fearful -- and sometimes gleeful -- fascination as the Tea Party drives a Thunderbird off the cliff with the president and speaker of the House strapped in the back. The Dow is hiding under the bed with a glass of single malt. Can it get more excruciating? Apple has more cash than the U.S. government.
Amid the chilling anarchy, there's not a single strong leader to be seen -- not even a misguided one. All the leaders are followers. You have to wonder if President Obama at some level doesn't want to lead. Maybe he just wants to be loved.
The citizens of this country tremble at the thought that these are the people governing them. Should we stick our money under our mattresses? It's not only the economy that gets nourished by confidence; it's also politics.
The maniacal Tea Party freshmen are trying to burn down the House they were elected to serve in. It turns out they wanted to come inside to get a blueprint of the historic building to sabotage it.
Like gargoyles on the Capitol, the adamantine nihilists are determined to blow up the country's prestige, their party and even their own re-election chances if that's what it takes. (Many are worried about primary races with even more dogmatic challengers, which is a truly scary thought.) If they can drag President Obama off his pedestal, even better. They think he looks down on them and sneers at their values.
Democratic lawmakers worry that the Tea Party freshmen have already ''neutered'' the president, as one told me. They fret that Obama is an inept negotiator. They worry that he should have been out in the country selling a concrete plan, rather than once more kowtowing to Republicans and, as with the stimulus plan, health care and Libya, leading from behind.
As one Democratic senator complained: ''The president veers between talking like a peevish professor and a scolding parent.'' (Not to mention a jilted lover.) Another moaned: ''We are watching him turn into Jimmy Carter right before our eyes.''
Obama's ''We must lift ourselves to a higher place'' trope doesn't work on this rough crowd. If somebody at dinner is about to kill you, you don't worry about his table manners.
More and more, 2008 looks like the tulip mania.
When Obama came before the cameras Friday to say that ''any solution to avoid default must be bipartisan,'' many Democrats wish he had just gone all unilateral and taken Bill Clinton's advice to invoke the 14th Amendment. They yearned to see the president beat the political suicide bombers over the head with the Constitution. Impeaching a constitutional lawyer for saving the economy would be an even more difficult sell than impeaching a rogue for fibbing about a dalliance.
The Gingrich revolution pulled Republicans to the right of the Reagan revolution and the Tea Party revolution pulled Republicans to the right of the Gingrich revolution. The difference, though, is existentially striking: The Reagan and Gingrich forces wanted a leaner government, but they still believed in government.
The sighing, spectral Harry Reid does not look up to the task of taking on the freshman wolfen.
The laconic president emerges from the sidelines periodically to warn about economic default, but we're already in political default.
Consider what the towel-snapping Tea Party crazies have already accomplished. They've changed the entire discussion. They've neutralized the White House. They've whipped their leadership into submission. They've taken taxes and revenues off the table. They've withered the stock and bond markets. They've made journalists speak to them as though they're John Calhoun and Alexander Hamilton.
Obama and John Boehner have been completely outplayed by the ''hobbits,'' as The Wall Street Journal and John McCain called them.
What if this is all a cruel joke on us? What if the people who hate government are good at it and the people who love government are bad at it?

 BODY:
James Traub challenges Senator John Kerry's impression that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel ''is prepared to make real sacrifices for peace'' by claiming that ''there's scant evidence that this is so.'' On the contrary, Netanyahu has demonstrated his commitment to peace in both word and deed. In 2009, he articulated his policy of a ''Palestinian state side by side with the Jewish state'' and in a recent speech to Congress, he stated that, in a peace agreement, ''some settlements will end up beyond Israel's borders'' and that ''with creativity and goodwill a solution can be found'' to the Jerusalem issue. He removed hundreds of checkpoints to strengthen the Palestinian economy in the West Bank and implemented an unprecedented 10-month moratorium on new settlement construction. Throughout, he has repeatedly expressed his readiness to negotiate with the Palestinians, without preconditions, to achieve peace.

Correction: An article on July 17 about the musician Wyclef Jean and his relief efforts in Haiti referred erroneously to a draft report from the United States Agency for International Development that gave the number of deaths from the earthquake in 2010. While the report initially stated 85,000, the agency had rescinded the figure and has not revised it. (The Haitian government claims the number is more than 300,000.)
Correction: An article on July 17 about Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority whip, misstated the level of cuts in government spending relative to gross domestic product as proposed in the legislation passed by the House of Representatives in April. It would have shrunk the percentage of federal nonsecurity discretionary spending, not the percentage of overall federal government spending, to pre-Great Depression levels.
Correction: The Riff column on June 19, about hoarding, misstated the profession of Gail Steketee, who has done research on the subject. She is the dean of the School of Social Work at Boston University, not a psychologist.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Increases Effort To Press for Compromise

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; Louise Story and Julie Creswell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
After a year of clashing with Washington over new financial reforms, the country's most powerful bankers have found common ground with regulators in the hard-fought effort to lift the debt ceiling and avoid a default.
Wall Street is no longer watching from the sidelines as the most polarizing political fight in years plays out on Capitol Hill. In the last few days, top executives have been in close contact with Washington in a last-ditch attempt to prod lawmakers toward a compromise by Tuesday, the administration's deadline to reach a deal.
On Friday, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, raised concerns with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner about the standoff over the debt ceiling and its potential to disrupt the system through which JP Morgan and other big banks disburse federal payments. Mr. Geithner assured him that the Treasury and Federal Reserve had taken steps to keep the payment system functioning smoothly, according to individuals briefed on the call.
In addition, more than a dozen chief executives from the nation's biggest financial services firms wrote a joint letter to President Obama and members of Congress on Thursday warning of ''very grave'' consequences for the economy and the job market if an agreement wasn't reached. 
It's not just chief executives who are now doing the talking, either.
Bankers have deluged Congressional staff members with research reports outlining the bleak consequences of a default, or even a downgrade of United States government debt by the major rating agencies. And in corporate America's version of grassroots mobilization, Allstate e-mailed 45,000 employees urging them to call their local members of Congress and demand a deal.
Hedge fund managers, normally among Wall Street's most secretive tribes, have been stepping out of the shadows, too.
Marc Lasry, a major Democratic fundraiser who manages the $14 billion Avenue Capital hedge fund, said he spoke to half a dozen members of Congress from both parties on Thursday and Friday with blunt warnings that failure to compromise on the debt ceiling risked permanently damaging the nation's financial standing.
''Over the last couple of weeks, everybody assumed it would get done,'' said Mr. Lasry. ''It's only in the last couple of days that I've gotten worried it might not.''
Not since 2008 have federal officials and bankers been so clearly aligned in their push for the same policies. Back then, the industry and regulators pressed Congress to pass legislation allowing the federal bank bailout at the height of the financial crisis.
''They both have the same interests at the end of the day,'' said Tom Block, a consultant and formerly the global head of government relations at JPMorgan Chase. ''They both want the banking system to be safe and sound.''
To be sure, with market turbulence almost certain to follow a default, Wall Streeters also want to safeguard bank profits and their own bonuses. Nevertheless, for much of the spring and early summer, while battle lines were being drawn by Republican and Democratic lawmakers, financial executives mostly stayed out of the fray.
According to lobbyists and executives, banks believed the two sides in Washington would ultimately find a way to make a deal. Plus, there were worries that being too outspoken might spook the financial markets. Most important, with the industry's image in tatters in the wake of the financial crisis and subsequent bailout, some bankers feared their involvement might actually be detrimental.
''Every time Wall Street raises its head, there are a lot of people ready to chop it off,'' said one senior banking industry official.
But as the deadline approached, anxiety began to take hold. A turning point came on July 11, when top officials from some of Wall Street's most powerful lobbying groups filed into an ornate conference room opposite Mr. Geithner's office on the third floor of the Treasury Building to make their case about the danger of inaction.
Several of the representatives, like Frank Keating of the American Bankers Association and John Engler of the Business Roundtable, were former governors with deep political connections. Others, including Robert S. Nichols of the Financial Services Forum and Leigh Ann Pusey of the American Insurance Association, are among the most powerful lobbyists in Washington.
''Everyone was on the same page,'' said Mr. Nichols. ''We all said this had to get done and it was urgent.''
Mr. Geithner told the group that anything they could do to get the debt ceiling lifted would be helpful, according to Mr. Nichols.
Administration officials reached out to the business community this spring, anticipating a bruising political fight. Over a lunch buffet in April in the Manhattan boardroom of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Mr. Geithner warned Wall Street executives of the dire consequences of failing to raise the debt ceiling.
Among the attendees were Henry Kravis, the private equity titan, Gary Cohn of Goldman Sachs, Robert Wolf of UBS, and the hedge fund managers John Paulson and Paul Singer.
But Wall Street's ensuing steps were mostly below the radar -- a very different tack than the much more dramatic efforts of recent days, and a sharp contrast to the tenacious and more public fight bankers have waged with the administration as it implements the financial regulatory reforms signed into law last summer.
Mr. Dimon's call to Mr. Geithner Friday was prompted by a growing concern in the last week that even a brief disruption in federal payments might force JPMorgan and other big banks to lay out billions of dollars to food-stamp recipients, military service members, and other beneficiaries of the government, unnerving both banks officials and customers.
In a statement, a Treasury spokeswoman, Colleen Murray, said ''in the event Congress does not act to raise the debt ceiling, Treasury had assured the Federal Reserve that we will only authorize them to make government payments when there are sufficient funds to cover such payments.''
A day before Mr. Dimon's phone call to Mr. Geithner, Allstate urged its employees to ''add your voice as an individual by encouraging your elected officials to redouble their efforts immediately to find a reasonable compromise.''
Earlier in the week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which donated heavily to Republican candidates last year, threw its weight behind a proposal to raise the debt ceiling backed by the House Speaker, John A. Boehner.
Mr. Boehner retooled his proposal to win House passage, but it was rejected by the Senate Friday night. Still, the Financial Services Roundtable, another major trade association, prepared a lobbying blitz this weekend to secure passage of whatever budget blueprint finally emerges.
But some lobbyists say it's the market, not political maneuvering, that will ultimately force Congress's hand.
''At the end of the day, people won't do this because they want to do this,'' said Jimmy Ryan, a lobbyist whose clients include the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and Citigroup. ''They will do this because they are scared of what will happen if they don't do it.''

HEADLINE: House Manager

BYLINE: By NORMAN ORNSTEIN. 
Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, is a co-author, with Thomas E. Mann, of ''The Broken Branch: How Congress Is Failing America and How to Get It Back on Track.''

 BODY:
MR. SPEAKER!
The Life and Times of Thomas B. Reed, the Man Who Broke the Filibuster
By James Grant
Illustrated. 426 pp. Simon & Schuster. $28.
Every serious student of Congress is familiar with Thomas B. Reed, a dominant speaker of the House near the end of the 19th century who was known as a ''czar'' for his use of the House rules to achieve the goals of his Republican majority. He was the precursor of the much more authoritarian ''Uncle Joe'' Cannon, whose ham-handed exercise of power led to the storied 1910 revolt that created the seniority system in Congress. It was Reed who transformed the speakership for the 20th century, but to most Americans, he is at best a dim figure from history, perhaps a candidate for a particularly tough question on ''Jeopardy!''
In some ways, Reed's relative anonymity is curious. He might have become president, or at least have won his party's nomination, if he had actively pursued it. Erudite and intellectual, possessed of a wicked wit, he kept Republicans together by the force of his personality and the power of his arguments, and defended his tough and controversial command of the House in a way that generated widespread respect among his colleagues from both parties. 
Cannon, on the other hand, was rough-hewn and imperious, and lost his power because a large number of his own resentful Republicans joined with Democrats to overturn his hegemony. Still, it is Cannon who has one of the three main House office buildings named after him, alongside Sam Rayburn and Nicholas Longworth.
James Grant would not immediately leap out as the logical choice to write a biography of Tom Reed. He is best known as a financial analyst, the editor of the respected Grant's Interest Rate Observer. But he is also an accomplished biographer, having previously taken on Bernard Baruch and John Adams. I suspect Grant was drawn to Reed in part because his era was rife with pitched battles over monetary policy. The question of whether gold, silver, both metals or none would back up Civil War greenbacks dominated much of the political debate, especially during presidential campaigns. And Grant writes about these issues at great length.
Whatever his reasons, in ''Mr. Speaker!'' Grant admirably succeeds in interweaving three components of the Reed story: his life and persona; the internal dynamics and operation of the House of Representatives; and the era in which Reed lived. The last is a story that will have meaning for anyone caught up with the politics of our own time.
Born in Portland, Me., in 1839, Reed practiced law before moving into politics in the State Legislature and as state attorney general. At the age of 37 he was elected to Congress, where he served 12 terms, including two tours as speaker of the House, from 1889 to 1891 and from 1895 to 1899. He resigned from Congress in large part over his disagreement with the American decision to go to war with Spain and build an empire by annexing Hawaii and the Philippines. This caused immense strain in his close relationship with Theodore Roosevelt, who had been an early and ardent supporter. He died at age 63 in 1902.
Congress in Reed's day had many powerful and talented figures, but he rose to the top as a tough partisan who made himself a master of the rules and ways of the House. His reputation was enhanced early on when, as a freshman, he conducted a devastatingly effective cross-examination of Samuel Tilden, the Democratic presidential nominee, during the dispute over the 1876 election. Reed made the point that there had been corruption and questionable behavior on both sides, which took much of the sting out of the charge that Rutherford B. Hayes and the Republicans had stolen the election. Soon he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. In 1889, despite formidable opposition (including from William McKinley, who later had to settle for the presidency), he ascended to the speakership, and with it the chairmanship of the powerful Rules Committee.
Reed immediately set out to deal with the problem that had plagued the House for decades -- its inability to overcome the incessant filibusters permitted through a device known as the disappearing quorum. The Constitution sets a majority of each house as the quorum required to do any official business. For decades, members of the House, even if physically in the chamber, were not counted for purposes of a quorum if they did not respond when their names were called. Given the frequent absences and illnesses in Congress in those days, the minority could easily paralyze procedures. Arguing against his Democratic colleagues' emotional defense that their practice was part of their constitutional duty, Reed replied, ''There is no such thing as suicide in any provision of the Constitution.'' It was one of several aphorisms Reed coined that are still in circulation today.
As Grant notes, obstructionism was a feature of many democratic institutions. It had plagued the British Parliament and even the Illinois Legislature, where in 1840, Abraham Lincoln jumped out a window in the state capitol to deny the Democratic majority the quorum it needed to adjourn. (Grant offers no comparisons with the modern United States Senate -- an unfortunate omission, especially since so many think the Senate filibuster came from the framers.) I know as well as anybody how difficult it is to write intelligibly, much less entertainingly, about Congressional procedures, and Grant explains complicated processes in lively and lucid terms.
The same is true of his treatment of Reed's life and times. This is actually a perfect moment for a full biography of Reed. His era spanned the Gilded Age (he was a friend of Mark Twain). It included tumultuous politics and even more tumultuous economics. Reed's role in the Tilden-Hayes election controversy brings to mind the Bush-Gore dispute of 2000 (though the earlier episode was even smellier and contained more threats of violence). It was a time of extremely close partisan divisions, swings in presidential elections and several changes in party control in Congress, just like ours. It featured tons of political scandals, involving money, patronage, huge interests lobbying to get their way -- just like our new Gilded Age. There were periods of boom and bust, an enormous real estate bubble that burst and the severe depression of 1893. There were also sharp controversies over the size and scope of government, and over whether the United States should go to war in distant places.
But the parallels seem to be part of what might be called a parallel universe. In Reed's time, the defender of expansive, activist government and of staunch protectionism was the Republican Party; the Democrats were the upholders of limited government and the champions of free trade. The huge fiscal problems of that day centered not on federal deficits but on federal surpluses, and what to do about them. For Republicans like Reed, high tariffs existed not just to protect industries, but to protect workers in America, enabling them to get better wages. Reed was also an outspoken proponent of woman suffrage (of which his wife disapproved). Congressional gridlock involving the use and misuse of the filibuster to thwart the majority's will was a problem in the House; back then, it wasn't a problem for the Senate.
It is good to have this excellent biography of Thomas Reed, a vastly underappreciated major figure in American political history. But it is especially worthwhile reading about him right now, because his era has so many similarities -- maybe too many -- with our own tumultuous and dysfunctional times.

BYLINE: By ZEV CHAFETS

 BODY:
The temperature was hovering near 90 degrees on the afternoon of Memorial Day when James O'Keefe III emerged from the woods and ambled over to my car. He was tall and thin, with pale skin and matted reddish hair. When his mug shot ran in the papers, some people told him he looked like Matthew Modine. Others said Lee Harvey Oswald. On the day I met him, he wore muddy work boots, filthy jeans and, despite the heat, a long-sleeved shirt. ''Keeps the mosquitoes off,'' he said. All day he was in the outback of a regional park just west of the Hudson, breaking rocks with a pickax to construct a trail. As a boy he was an Eagle Scout, but this wasn't a nature project. O'Keefe, the man whose video stings helped take down high-ranking people at National Public Radio and led to the demise of Acorn, the nation's biggest grass-roots community organizing group, was doing federal time. 
Eighteen months ago O'Keefe and three confederates, two dressed as telephone repairmen, walked into the New Orleans office of Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. This was during the debate over President Obama's health-care plan, and angry opponents of the bill, which Landrieu supported, claimed their calls weren't being answered. Landrieu's staff said the voice-mail system was not working properly because of high call volume, and O'Keefe's guys were out to get her staff to say that the phones were really fine while he captured the exchange on film. Similar strategies worked well in the past, but this time he was arrested and brought before a federal judge. In the end, he pleaded to a misdemeanor charge of entering federal property under false pretenses, paid a $1,500 fine and was sentenced to three years of probation and 100 hours of community service.
O'Keefe wasn't happy about spending his Memorial Day turning rocks into pebbles to pay his debt to society, but what really bothered him were the terms of his probation. He couldn't leave New Jersey, his home state, without court approval, and the court in New Orleans, where he was sentenced, had turned down a travel request. At first O'Keefe feared revealing this bit of information -- ''my enemies will use it against me,'' he said darkly -- but indignation overcame caution. ''I have to get government permission to accept speaking dates, which is how I make my living. I can't travel to work on new projects. And I can't leave to train others.''
To him, this was the most galling restriction. O'Keefe aspires to more than making movies. He seems to be styling himself as the organizer and commander in chief of a vast guerrilla army of young conservatives trained in his methods and inspired by his example. ''There are already dozens of teams out there working,'' he told me. ''And there are thousands more who want to learn and get involved. The more they restrict me, the more they inspire me.'' He extracted a cellphone from the pocket of his work shirt. ''Have you ever heard of a Russian named Solzhenitsyn?'' he asked. The question reminded me that O'Keefe, who in some ways is knowing and cynical, is also just 27. For a moment I thought he was going to call the Soviet dissident, who died in 2008, but he simply wanted to access and declaim a few lines of a Solzhenitsyn speech on liberty, law and the abuse of government power, which he thought I should find relevant to his predicament.
''I'm not comparing my situation to the gulag,'' he said. ''But I speak truth to power. You'd think liberal baby boomers would support me. Isn't that what the '60s were all about? Do we really want political prisoners in America?'' Still, the restrictions he faced weren't really slowing him down. As we spoke, he told me, an army of videographers was spreading out across the land and taking aim at a fresh target. This will be the biggest one yet, he promised.
My first meeting with O'Keefe, a month or so earlier, was somewhat awkward. He arrived at the Chart House restaurant in Weehawken, N.J., right on time, but he seemed slightly surprised he had showed up at all. ''You're from The New York Times,'' he said. ''How can I be sure you'll be objective and accurate?''
''The same way I can be sure you're not filming this conversation,'' I replied.
O'Keefe assured me that he would never do such a thing. I assured him that my article would be a model of journalistic rectitude. I think it is fair to say that neither of us was fully convinced, then or in our subsequent encounters. He came to the meeting with a large plastic bag full of newspaper clippings of his exploits. Most of them, he felt, were examples of shoddy journalism. O'Keefe is not a fan of the media. ''All journalists are either pundits or stenographers,'' he told me, a remark I duly noted in my notebook. ''We need stenographers, as long as they record the truth,'' he added graciously.
I made it clear to O'Keefe that, in addition to faithfully relating his thoughts, I wanted to see him in action. ''You mean see how the sausage is made?'' he asked. ''I don't know about that.''
''Take your time and think about it,'' I said. We walked out of the restaurant together, and by the time we reached his car -- a 1975 Triumph Spitfire convertible -- he had made his decision. ''I'll call you when there's something going on,'' he said.
The call came a couple of weeks later, on a blustery Saturday afternoon. O'Keefe and an actor were shooting ''b-roll'' for a coming sting. ''I can't tell you what the actual project is,'' he said. ''That would compromise the mission. But I think this will be interesting for you. Meet me in an hour at Liberty State Park in Jersey City.''
When I arrived, O'Keefe was on one knee, aiming his Sony high-definition camcorder at a young fellow clad in a leather jacket, Glengarry military hat and kilt. A white fox head sporran dangled between his legs. He wore shades and carried a briefcase, which turned out to be full of gold- and silver-plated bars that he took out and replaced at O'Keefe's direction. In the distance, with her back to the scene, loomed Lady Liberty. It seemed appropriate that she was being filmed from her blind side.
The fellow in the kilt introduced himself as Sean Murphy. When I asked him for the spelling of his given name, he stumbled. ''It's an alias,'' O'Keefe explained, which he would use on the videos. Sean had a black '84 Corvette, and O'Keefe filmed him climbing in and out of the driver's seat several times. They wrapped the shot, jumped in the car and peeled out to the New Jersey Turnpike with me, in a rented blue Corolla, in hot pursuit. For the next few hours we careered around north Jersey, stopping at various sites to shoot pieces of the puzzle. One was at the Bayonne docks, where huge shipping containers stacked five and six high behind a storm fence formed a backdrop. It seemed to me that someone might construe filming here as suspicious, but O'Keefe was untroubled. ''It's completely legal to be here,'' he said. ''Besides, there are no security cameras around here. I checked it out.''
O'Keefe's stings, marked by outlandish costumes and outrageous stories, are as much theater as political statement. But there is nothing of the merry prankster about him. He is a worrier, with the bitten-down fingernails to prove it. He has a keen eye for the absurdity and hypocrisy of others, but it is unmatched by self-deprecating humor or a discernible sense of fun.
As a director, he is all business. Our final destination was Newark Liberty International Airport, and in the baggage area he slipped Sean a pocket-size audio recorder and instructed him to approach the Welcome Desk, swivel his head as if searching for something and strike up a conversation with the clerk. ''Tell him you've spoken with health-department officials and you need to pick up your product, your shipment. Ask him where the docks are. Have the conversation, see how it goes.''
Sean ambled over to the desk, where a young man in a red jacket began leafing through schedules, trying to be of help. O'Keefe stood 50 feet away, behind a baggage cart, his Sony at hip level, obscured by the handlebars, filming. The scene took about two minutes, and it required just one take.
Gold and silver bars, a black Corvette, a mysterious shipment -- I still had no idea what O'Keefe's sting was going to be. But no matter what it exposed, I doubted it would be more frightening than the fact that two young guys, one in a kilt, the other equipped with a video camera, can film the Statue of Liberty, the New Jersey docks and a major international airport without attracting any attention.
''One thing you have to know about me is that I'm a builder,'' O'Keefe told me. ''My grandfather is a carpenter, and he spent his life making things out of nothing. I'm that way, too. A lot of people sit around discussing what to do. They draw up proposals, look for funding and nothing happens. I grab my camera and go do it.''
O'Keefe grew up in Westwood, N.J., and still lives with his parents. His father is an engineer, his mother a physical therapist. In high school he was a theater guy, but Rutgers radicalized him. He was incensed by what he considered the political correctness on campus. Soon he began writing biting columns in the college newspaper, The Daily Targum, which caught the eye of Morton Blackwell, the head of the Leadership Institute in Arlington, Va., which he founded 32 years ago. The institute trains young conservative activists and budding journalists (including Ainsley Earhardt and Adam Housley of Fox News). In all, Blackwell says that there are some 90 institute graduates working in local and network news around the country. The institute has also helped establish more than 100 conservative alternative campus newspapers and magazines, and it gave O'Keefe seed money for The Centurion. O'Keefe's last editorial, ''I Have a Dream,'' set forth a vision of a college where, among other things, conservative views were respected, Christian tradition was honored and people realized that ''guns are no more responsible for Columbine than spoons are responsible for Michael Moore's obesity.''
Rutgers was also the target of O'Keefe's first sting. He and two friends, posing as members of the Irish Heritage Society, met with a dining-hall administrator to complain that the ''green-cladded huckster'' leprechaun on the Lucky Charms cereal boxes sold in the cafeteria was offensive. The cereal wasn't banned, but the clip of the Rutgers official solemnly weighing the merits of the case became an instant right-wing campus classic.
After graduating in 2006, O'Keefe went to work at the Leadership Institute. ''James was an extremely hard worker,'' Blackwell says. ''He probably conducted about 75 training programs around the country.'' In California he met Lila Rose, a student at U.C.L.A. Posing as a couple, they visited two offices of Planned Parenthood in Los Angeles. At one, Rose, who claimed to be 15 years old and pregnant, was advised by a worker to lie about her age to qualify for an abortion. ''Just figure out a birthday that works,'' the Planned Parenthood staff member said. ''I don't know anything.'' This video cost two people their jobs. One was the Planned Parenthood employee; the other was James O'Keefe.
''We teach conservatives how to focus their principles, but we don't take positions on contentious issues,'' says Blackwell, whose institute's tax-exempt status depends on at least the veneer of nonpartisanship. ''We told James to end his sting activities or leave.''
It wasn't a hard choice for a zealous young man. For a while O'Keefe did freelance reporting. He also began to work on his Acorn prank, in which he and a woman named Hannah Giles posed as a pimp and a prostitute and secretly recorded officials advising them on how to break various laws. He got some financial support from Andrew Breitbart, the conservative media provocateur who also helped disseminate the Acorn videos. The two are still on friendly terms, but O'Keefe struck out on his own, establishing Project Veritas, whose mission is ''to investigate and expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical and transparent society.'' In April 2011, the I.R.S. granted Veritas tax-exempt status. O'Keefe considers this to be a vindication, proof that he is a nonpartisan journalistic investigator.
''Undercover journalism goes back to at least the 1820s in this country,'' says Brooke Kroeger, the director of the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute at New York University, who has written a book on the subject, to be published next year. ''And the use of hidden cameras to do it came into prominence after World War II.'' Muckrakers, of course, are advocates, loved or despised according to the targets they choose. ''For years, advocacy groups such as those for a better government have partnered with journalistic organizations,'' Kroeger says. ''Last year the Humane Society released an undercover video of the inhumane treatment of pigs in Virginia that got picked up by media around the country and won applause from animal lovers. Many of those same people vociferously went after O'Keefe for his expose of NPR. It's basically a question of what you care about and what side you are on.''
Earlier this year, two of O'Keefe's actors, posing as fictitious representatives of a Muslim philanthropic organization, had lunch with Ron Schiller, NPR's senior vice president for development. In the course of ingratiating himself with these potential donors, Schiller was caught denigrating Tea Party members and Republicans in language that the corporation later said it was appalled by. The scandal hastened the departures of both Schiller and his boss, Vivian Schiller (no relation). When it was suggested that the tapes had been dishonestly edited, O'Keefe invited people to watch them in their entirety. ''He said it, that's just a fact,'' Dana Davis Rehm, a spokesman for NPR, said of Ron Schiller. In the aftermath, NPR conducted sessions on ethics for its support and operational staff and is planning to publish updated ethics guidelines in September.
His takedown of Acorn was even more devastating, although Bertha Lewis, Acorn's former chief executive, contends that the videos were dishonest. ''He is demon, a liar and a cheat,'' she says. ''What he did was despicable. He created a fiction.'' Bertha Lewis still insists that Acorn did not offer advice on how to break the law. Clark Hoyt, a former public editor for The New York Times, reviewed O'Keefe's raw footage and edited tapes and concluded that ''the most damning words match the transcripts and the audio, and do not seem out of context.''
There is no doubt that O'Keefe disseminated only the material that supported his thesis about Acorn, but this kind of selectivity is the norm in advocacy journalism. ''I put James O'Keefe in the same category as Michael Moore,'' says Dean Mills, dean of the University of Missouri's school of journalism. ''Some ethicists say it is never right for a journalist to deceive for any reason, but there are wrongs in the world that will never be exposed without some kind of subterfuge.''
''People can't control me,'' O'Keefe says. ''No one tells me what to investigate.'' But that freedom from oversight means he has no one to offer a second opinion. Andrew Breitbart, summing it up after the fact, called the Landrieu sting a ''high risk, low reward'' mistake. O'Keefe himself acknowledges that he used bad judgment in that operation. ''If I had it to do over again, I'd do it outside a federal building.''
Hundreds of people contact James O'Keefe with suggestions for investigations and stings. He looks for situations that illustrate what he sees as larger injustices. He also recruits activists. ''It takes a lot of what you could call courage to go into the opposition's presence and tell a story under a false name,'' he says. ''People ready to improvise and maybe get caught.''
I met two such risk-takers at a nighttime strategy session in Room 218 of the Comfort Inn Hotel in Paramus, N.J. Vanessa Jean-Louis, a 26-year-old woman of Haitian descent who counsels inner-city youth in northern New Jersey, was there. She met O'Keefe at last year's Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington and volunteered for Project Veritas. Shaughn Adeleye, a Nigerian-American in his 30s who has worked with O'Keefe before, joined us by Skype from Lafayette, La.
When it comes to motivation, O'Keefe is a student of the left-wing community organizer Saul Alinksy and of Douglas Hyde, a British Communist who became a Catholic convert and activist. Their shared insight is that action begins with a personal concern. Jean-Louis, for whom this would be an inaugural project, was worried about the children she worked with. ''Ninety percent of the kids have no father living at home,'' she said. ''They're maladapted because of government policies that leave them fatherless.''
''There has always been a sense of family in the African-American community, and it is being chipped away,'' Adeleye said.
O'Keefe sat on the couch, a computer on his lap, typing. Adeleye said, ''We should expose the incentives that the system gives for fatherless families.''
''What agencies do this?'' O'Keefe asked.
''Welfare,'' Jean-Louis said.
''We need to find out the specifics,'' O'Keefe said. He didn't challenge Jean-Louis's assumption; it is standard conservative doctrine. But there is a difference between a topic and a story.
''A couple could approach a caseworker and say they're thinking of getting married, but they can't decide if they should because it might be a loss in benefits,'' Adeleye offered.
''A mom and a baby daddy, and the caseworker telling them not to get married,'' Jean-Louis added.
''Even if they love each other,'' O'Keefe said, giving the story an emotional center. ''If the caseworker still says not to get married, that would be really powerful. Of course the headline will say, 'O'Keefe Goes After Welfare,' but some people actually need welfare. We're looking to expose people who don't. Maybe we should give the couple good jobs. That way there would be no economic justification for telling them to stay on welfare.''
''Right,'' Jean-Louis. ''A caseworker telling a black man not to marry.''
''A white caseworker,'' Adeleye said.
Jean-Louis laughed. ''A white male caseworker telling a black male.''
''You won't find a white male caseworker,'' Adeleye said.
''O.K., a white woman caseworker telling a black man not to marry a black woman. You know sisters are going to be outraged at that!''
''Maybe we should do a comparison video,'' O'Keefe said, ''with a white couple or a white man.''
''Oh, wow!'' Jean-Louis said. ''If there is no racial aspect to this, if it is just policy, it's bigger than just race!''
''Exactly,'' O'Keefe said. ''Marriage is being challenged, made extinct.''
''The only thing is,'' Jean-Louis said, ''I don't want anybody losing their job over this, just because they are following policy.''
''This isn't about just one person or a few bad apples,'' O'Keefe said. His critics charge that he often goes after small fry instead of taking on the higher-ups. This was certainly true in the cases of Acorn and Planned Parenthood. But he argues that by showing what goes on in the trenches, it is possible to infer patterns of institutional behavior.
''Right,'' Jean-Louis said. ''The objective is to affect policy.''
''No,'' O'Keefe said firmly. ''The object is to expose reality. We don't choose the consequences. Let the people change things. Remember, Congress and the president defunded Acorn, not me.''
In the woods on Memorial Day, I asked O'Keefe if he knew the song ''I Fought the Law'' (''and the law won''). ''Another side of the '60s,'' I said. He smiled without mirth. He was stuck in New Jersey, unable to pursue his mission, and after I left, he'd be heading back to work among the mosquitoes.
But June brought O'Keefe good news. The court in New Orleans decided to allow him to travel for work. And earlier this month he began releasing a series of videos taken in Medicaid offices around the country. In one of the first he made public, ''Sean Murphy,'' dressed in the same regalia he wore on the New Jersey shoot, presented himself to a Medicaid worker in Charleston, S.C., as an Irish drug importer and Irish Republican Army member who wanted coverage for 25 wounded comrades who entered the U.S. illegally. The kindly worker spent time photocopying applications and dealing with this improbable applicant. While she made it clear that he had to abide by the regulations, she also assured him that she didn't want to know details. ''It is definitely not in my own best interest to divulge anything to anyone,'' she said. ''I do not want to go to jail.'' In another video, shot in Ohio, two fake Russian drug dealers requested government help. It isn't exactly a secret that some Medicaid money winds up in unqualified hands, but it was surprising to see how willingly minor officials turned a blind eye and, in some cases, even offered advice on how to game the system. No money was distributed, but there will be repercussions. The first video was out for only hours before an Ohio state spokesman called it ''extremely troubling.'' Soon after, it was announced that the Medicaid worker who coached them on how to hide their ownership of an $800,000 automobile had been placed on paid administrative leave. Officials in at least two states immediately began their own investigations.
Had the videos revealed a larger injustice, O'Keefe's stated goal? Had they demonstrated waste and abuse in Great Society initiatives run amok, or were they simply exposing the failures of some well-meaning, low-level bureaucrats in a basically worthy government program? It depends on your perspective. As for James O'Keefe, he is already looking for the next target.

 BODY:
AGE OF GREED
The Triumph of Finance and the Decline of America, 1970 to the Present
By Jeff Madrick
Illustrated. 464 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $30.
Seven years ago, James Mann published ''Rise of the Vulcans,'' a history of the neoconservative foreign-policy advisers who rose to prominence with the presidency of George W. Bush. Mann traced the group's origins to the 1970s, when figures like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld got their start in government, and told how events from East Asia to Kuwait solidified their faith in American assertiveness abroad. Of course, Mann was writing against the backdrop of the Iraq invasion. The belief system he chronicled had culminated in overreach. 
Jeff Madrick's ''Age of Greed'' almost seems to have set out to be the economic equivalent of Mann's history. Writing against the backdrop of the 2007-9 financial crisis, Madrick, the author of ''The End of Affluence,'' also starts his story in the 1970s, tracing the regulatory and cultural changes that led to our current trouble. In Madrick's telling, a cabal of conservatives, driven first by greed and second by ''extreme free-market ideology,'' gradually seized power. The result, as proclaimed in his bold subtitle, was ''the triumph of finance and the decline of America.''
It's clear from the outset that Madrick has his work cut out for him. Where Mann's story concentrated on six individuals who held office through successive Republican administrations, Madrick draws in a far wider cast of characters: thinkers like Milton Friedman; business leaders like Jack Welch; presidents like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. It's not always obvious what connects these disparate figures, so the book jumps from pen portrait to pen portrait without always advancing its main theme.
And the theme itself is slippery. A history of neoconservatism can home in on self-professed neocons, whose actions are clearly informed by a defined body of beliefs. But it's harder to identify a cabal that self-consciously embraced greed as a guiding philosophy. To be sure, the insider trader Ivan Boesky once defended greed at a forum in Berkeley, Calif. But an undertow of avarice is surely a human constant. Was Sandy Weill, the Wall Street executive who retained a corporate jet while slashing retired employees' health insurance, really so very different from a 19th-century Rockefeller or Vanderbilt?
If the greed of Boesky or Weill is unsurprising, the lack of greed evinced by some of Madrick's characters is striking. Paul Volcker, the Fed chairman whom Madrick eccentrically berates for his determined fight against inflation, was known to be frugal; John Reed, Citigroup's boss during the 1990s, was by Madrick's own account ''thoughtful and unflashy.'' Reagan himself was more enthusiastic about self-reliance and hard work than about material advancement, remarking that ''free enterprise is not a hunting license.'' Early in his career, Walter Wriston, Reed's predecessor at Citi and perhaps the character whom Madrick conjures most successfully, was offered a salary of $1 million to move to Monaco and work for Aristotle Onassis. He chose to remain in a middle-income housing project in Stuyvesant Village.
If ''Age of Greed'' is an unhelpful label, what of Madrick's secondary contention -- that the era was defined by extreme free-market ideology? Well, the extreme was pretty mainstream. Free-market ideas were embraced by Democrats almost as much as by Republicans. Jimmy Carter initiated the big push toward deregulation, generally with the support of his party in Congress. Bill Clinton presided over the growth of the loosely supervised shadow financial system and the repeal of Depression-era restrictions on commercial banks. Centrist intellectuals like Lawrence Summers, who was fully aware of market failures -- indeed, who had emphasized them in his academic writings -- nonetheless embraced pro-market public policies because, he thought, they were more right than not.
Besides, free-market policies were never embraced with the unqualified enthusiasm that some imagine. Throughout Madrick's period, entitlement spending grew and armies of supervisors at multiple agencies tried to keep the financial sector in check. Contrary to Madrick's view that the regulators were always retreating, the 1980s saw the imposition of new capital-adequacy rules on banks, and the 2000s brought the passage of the ambitious /Sarbanes-Oxley accounting reforms. These regulatory efforts proved hard to enforce, but the record hardly supports Madrick's argument that policy was captured by free-market extremists.
The real causes of the crisis are more subtle and interesting than Madrick believes. Frequently, as the nation built the system that ultimately imploded, intelligent, pragmatic, nonideological and generally ungreedy individuals wrestled with the options that confronted them -- and concluded that some measure of deregulation was the least bad way forward.
Consider the response to Wriston's efforts in the 1960s to end-run Regulation Q, the rule that restricted banks' freedom to pay interest on demand deposits. Regulators fully understood that the demise of Reg Q would drive up the banks' borrowing costs, which would in turn lead them to chase higher-yielding loans to riskier customers. But regulators could also see that Q was an anachronism. Given the inflation of the Vietnam period, savers were not going to hand banks their money unless they were paid interest. If Q was enforced, depositors would lend directly to companies by buying their debt in the securities markets. The choice was between deregulating the banks, which would be risky, or seeing financial activity move into hard-to-monitor markets, which might be even more risky.
By allowing such stories into his narrative, Madrick rescues his book from his own unconvincing thesis. He makes extensive and generally good use of secondary sources (I am among the many authors cited), though there are some confusions and errors. He twice states that the hedge fund manager Julian Robertson escaped losses during the October 1987 crash. Actually, Robertson took a 30 percent hit that month, and afterward told his investors that ''probably none of us have ever lost so much money so fast in our lives.'' More seriously, Madrick misconstrues the Princeton economist Alan Blinder, citing him in support of the curious view that policy makers could have dealt with the Carter-era inflation by waiting it out. What Blinder actually wrote was that part of the 1970s inflation required no policy response, since it resulted from temporary spikes in food and fuel prices that would self-correct. But the other part of the decade's inflation, Blinder acknowledged, reflected excessively loose money, and the Fed had no choice but to tighten the supply.
Even though Madrick does not deliver on his thesis, readers will still find worthwhile stories in his pages. In 1970 Walter Wriston, having loaded up on risky assets after sidestepping Reg Q, faced the prospect of a large loss when Penn Central railroad defaulted. He immediately called the Fed and announced that the financial system itself was at risk, demanding that the central bank's emergency lending operations be kept open over the weekend. The Fed obliged, easing Wriston's losses. Four decades ago, in other words, the ''too big to fail'' doctrine was already /operative.

HEADLINE: Taxes, and a Dangerous Purity

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
WHAT does the face of antitax absolutism look like?
It has a tentative beard, more shadow than shag, like an awkward weigh station on the road from callow to professorial. It wears blunt glasses over narrowed eyes that glint mischievously, and its mouth is rarely still, because there's no end to the jeremiads pouring forth: about the peril of Obama, the profligacy of Democrats and the paramount importance of opposing all tax increases, even ones that close the loopiest of loopholes.
It belongs to Grover Norquist, and if you hadn't seen it before, you probably spotted it last week, as he pinged from CNN to MSNBC to Fox, reveling in the solidarity Republicans had shown against any new revenue. The country was lurching toward a possible default, but Norquist was riding high. In between television appointments on Thursday, he met me for breakfast near Times Square.
As he walked in and sat down he was sermonizing. As he got up and left an hour later he was still going strong. He seems to live his whole life in midsentence and takes few detectable breaths, his zeal boundless and his catechism changeless: Washington is an indiscriminate glutton, and extra taxes are like excess calories, sure to bloat the Beast. 
When he ordered only an egg white omelet with spinach, I had to wonder: preferred meal or deliberate metaphor?
He's that consumed. Moments earlier, when he had asked a server about the breakfast options and was directed to a menu right in front of him, he proclaimed, ''Oh, it's written down! Unlike the Gang of Six proposal.'' He was against that -- it included revenue -- and wasn't about to miss a chance to say so, even this oddly incongruent opportunity.
It's the group Norquist runs, Americans for Tax Reform, that has been pressing politicians for decades to sign a pledge not to vote for any net tax increase under any circumstances. All but 6 of the 240 Republicans in the House, along with two Democrats, have done so.
Republicans differ on whether that reflects the sway of Norquist, who often vilifies pledge resisters during their primary campaigns, or is simply the temper of these Tea Partying times. Which came first: the Norquist or the egg?
Either way, he has emerged as the most visible mouthpiece and muse of the lower-taxes, less-government troops that have played a major role in the debt crisis. And he provides a handy window into them.
His assessment of Obama was succinct: ''The president of the United States is a left-wing ideologue.''
His analysis of the Democratic Party's values and tactics was unambiguous -- and uncomplicated by the deficits racked up under Obama's predecessor.
''Their game plan has always been spend, spend, spend, then come and ask Republicans to be responsible and raise taxes,'' he said.
''Democrats are like a teenage boy on a prom date,'' he added, proceeding to act out multiple parts in an imagined conversation, which is one of his favorite things to do. ''They keep asking. Maybe she'll say yes. 'No! No! No!' But they have to keep asking. It's part of their DNA -- teenage boys and Democrats.''
Norquist has metaphor mania. The one he hatched to argue that tax increases -- as opposed to spending cuts -- are a clumsy way to manage budgetary woes yanked the conversation into a hypothetical operating room.
''I'm a surgeon,'' he posited. ''I'm never going to have a baseball bat in my list of tools, because I don't think a baseball bat is very useful in taking out a kidney. 'Oh, it worked for one patient!' No! I'm not going to use a baseball bat to take out a kidney. It leaves too much blood on the floor.''
In short, tax increases are inelegant instruments, and you can't let Derek Jeter perform organ excavation. Whether or not it's covered under Obamacare.
Norquist equated keeping a lid on taxes with separating church and state, casting both as unshakable positions. The Founding Fathers, he added, had no problem with absolutes.
''The Constitution has a list of things that the government's not allowed to do ever, ever, ever. The government's not allowed to tell you what church to go to. Ever. Period. It's just not. So you say, 'What if God comes down and tells everyone He's an Episcopalian? Can we do it then?' No! Not then. Even then we cannot do it. Got it? It's not allowed. We can't steal your guns. 'Well, what if I want to? What if a bad person has a gun?' No. Uh-uh. No.'' His omelet was virtually untouched.
What Democrats want, he said, is ''to turn us into Europe, the European welfare state, somewhere between France and Greece. Which is an improvement. When I was in college, the guys I debated wanted to turn us into something between Sweden and East Germany. The left has receded in its demands. Most people on college campuses don't speak as admiringly as the kids I went to college used to about the Khmer Rouge.''
That college was the same bastion of supposed elitism that gave the president his law degree: Harvard. In the decades after Norquist, now 54, graduated, he became an immensely well-connected player in the conservative establishment, a compatriot of the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, and a magnet for corporate support. Businesses like their loopholes.
But they don't like default, and there was chatter in Washington last week about whether Norquist had done their bidding too well. Were the Boehner-resistant House conservatives Norquist acolytes run amok? Was he having a Dr. Frankenstein moment?
And is his tax-slashing fervor entirely genuine, or is it ramped up, a theatrical means to get attention? That question dogs him as well. He has framed many of the newspaper and magazine articles about him, and displays them in the A.T.R.'s Washington headquarters.
But vanity is too commonplace inside the Beltway to be troubling. What's alarming about Norquist and the pledge mentality, which has spread to other causes and other points of the political spectrum, is their promotion of the idea that political rigidity is to be prized above all else. That purity is king. Such a theology precludes nimbleness and compromise, which are not only the hallmarks of maturity but also the essence of sane government.
When making the rounds on Capitol Hill last week, I dropped in on Representative Kevin Yoder, a Republican freshman from Kansas. He considers himself a fiscal conservative, but voted in favor of the Boehner bill. And he never did sign Norquist's pledge.
His reason was as modestly stated as it was unimpeachable. ''My responsibility lies to my constituents,'' not to Norquist, he said, adding: ''I can't foresee every scenario.'' No one can. That's why it's best not to paint yourself into a corner, and to leave room even for an Episcopal conversion.

 BODY:
Look at the rates on inflation-protected US bonds:
Negative rates at 5 and 7 years; all of 0.38 percent on 10 years. Borrowing to spend on useful infrastructure, or even just to put people to work in ways that enhance revenue down the road, would almost surely improve the long-run fiscal picture. Conversely, austerity now almost surely hurts the budget as well as the economy.
So you know what all the serious people insist that we be doing ...

HEADLINE: Becoming the Party of Freedom

BYLINE: MARC EGNAL


HIGHLIGHT: What pushed the Civil War Republicans to embrace emancipation?

 BODY:
Republicans began the Civil War as the party of Union, not the party of Freedom. They did not become the celebrated destroyers of slavery until almost two years into the war, with the Emancipation Proclamation, issued Jan. 1, 1863. But during the summer of 1861 the direction of change was unmistakable, as Republicans took the first, crucial steps in a mounting attack on the South's "peculiar institution." Long-held beliefs about the immorality of slavery combined with the challenges posed by an escalating conflict, explain the evolving outlook of the Republicans. 
Along with a strong commitment to expanding the Northern economy, the Republican Party had always emphasized its opposition to slavery: both the 1856 and 1860 platforms cited the Declaration of Independence with its ringing affirmation of liberty for all. Many of the individuals leading the new party had long denounced bondage. Representative Owen Lovejoy, whose abolitionist brother had been killed by a pro-slavery mob, labeled the institution "the sum of all villainy"; Abraham Lincoln remarked that he favored free soil "because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself." Most mainstream Republicans shared this outlook. 
And yet that cauldron of antislavery sentiment bubbled alongside the carefully restrained policies the party enunciated. Republicans promised to respect slavery where it existed. They agreed to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act. Seeking to rule a nation of property owners, the new party eschewed lawless actions, even those committed in opposition to slavery. Indeed, before 1861 the only step the Republicans advocated to speed the demise of slavery was restricting its spread into the territories. But, free soil was not abolition, and Republicans recognized that barring slavery from the West would lead to its ultimate extinction only far in the future.
Had the Civil War been brief, the Republicans' reverence for property rights - rather than their profound antislavery convictions - would have prevailed, and Southern institutions would likely have emerged unscathed. During April and May 1861 federal forces captured and returned the hundreds of African Americans who rushed to the Union troops in Maryland or crossed the Mason-Dixon Line into Pennsylvania. A Maryland editorialist remarked that more fugitives had been recovered since Lincoln took office "than during the whole of Mr. Buchanan's presidential term."
But as the clash continued, new circumstances gradually led the Republicans to rethink their cautious policies. The beginnings of change came toward the end of May, when Gen. Benjamin Butler accepted three fugitives at Fort Monroe in Virginia. Butler wrote to the War Department for advice, leading Lincoln to discuss the matter with his cabinet. Many in Washington, like General in Chief Winfield Scott (who chortled at "Butler's fugitive slave law"), expected a simple reaffirmation of the administration's commitment to returning slaves. 
Instead, in response to Butler's request Lincoln and his cabinet mapped out a policy that moved the North away from strict adherence to the fugitive slave law. The president had to strike a careful balance. On the one hand, he knew that various concerns reinforced the Republicans' defense of property rights. To win the war and preserve the republican "experiment" Lincoln had to keep together an unwieldy coalition. It included not only Republicans but also Democrats and Border State Unionists who demanded a strict adherence to the Constitution. On the other hand, Lincoln and other members of the cabinet could hardly ignore their long-held antislavery beliefs and the wonderful opportunity offered by Butler's initiative. 
The result? Butler was told that his decision to harbor the slaves was "approved," but he was given no indication whether these individuals, and the many others now arriving at "Fortress Freedom," were considered free. Similarly mixed messages were provided to other commanders. Hence some officers welcomed numerous "contrabands" into their camps, while others, like Henry Halleck and George McClellan, returned runaways to their masters. Not until March 1862 did Congress order the Army to keep all fugitives. 
The Northern defeat at Bull Run on July 21 led Republicans to take yet another step toward emancipation. In the immediate aftermath of the battle, lawmakers accepted a resolution, put forth by John Crittenden of Kentucky, affirming that the Union would not interfere "with the rights or established institutions" of the South. But many Republicans soon had second thoughts about any effort to protect slavery. Northerners now recognized that the conflict would be a prolonged one and that slaves were an important resource for the Confederates. More than ever before, Republicans voiced long-held antislavery feelings, and expounded the moral, economic and strategic reasons for emancipation. 
The most visible result was that on Aug. 6 Congress passed the Confiscation Act, which allowed Union officers to take and free those slaves the Confederates had used for military purposes. This measure, which moved a step beyond what Butler had done, worried Lincoln, who feared it might alienate the Border States. He signed the bill, according to the New York Times, "with great reluctance."
The next step in the radicalization of Republican, and Northern, opinion came with John C. Fremont's proclamation at the end of August. After suffering a series of reverses, Fremont, who commanded federal forces in Missouri, declared that he would emancipate the slaves owned by his Confederate opponents. Republicans across the North cheered this bold move. "Everybody of every sect, party, sex, and color approves it," declared Senator James Grimes of Iowa. But Lincoln, acutely aware of the impact the proclamation would have on the pivotal state of Kentucky, first requested and then ordered Fremont to revoke his decree. A few weeks later he removed the general. 
Despite Fremont's removal, by the fall of 1861 Lincoln's views and the outlook of most Republicans had become far more radical. While as yet only a minority of senators and congressmen called for emancipation, that chorus had grown mightily since the beginning of the war. When Congress reconvened in December it refused to reaffirm the Crittenden resolution. In his State of the Union address Lincoln set forth his own plan for ending slavery. Although the proposal would prove unworkable, resting as it did on voluntarism, compensation and colonization, the plan displayed Lincoln's newfound belief that the status quo was unacceptable.
The boldness of the slaves themselves and the escalating war helped drive this change. But "events" are not a sufficient explanation. Democrats and Border State Unionists, who traditionally had been less vehement in their opposition to bondage, resisted each of the steps. Only when changing circumstances are combined with the beliefs of a party that had long condemned (in Lincoln's words) the "vast moral evil" of slavery does the march toward freedom become understandable.

HEADLINE: How Far Will Republicans Go to Avoid Defense Cuts?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: As a philosophical matter, tax increases are probably more anathema to Republican voters than defense cuts. But as a practical matter the reverse may be true.

 BODY:
One of the only negatives for Republicans in a debt ceiling deal that otherwise looks very favorable to them is the possibility of heavy cuts to defense spending. Roughly $600 billion in cuts to the Pentagon's budget would be "triggered" if Congress is unable to agree to the deficit-reduction recommendations made by a special Congressional Joint Committee.
Democratic lawmakers have argued that the defense cuts are likely to be an insufficient inducement for Republicans to consider raising taxes as part of the Joint Committee process. That would guarantee that at all $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction would be achieved through spending cuts of one kind or another.
So just what do Republicans think about defense cuts? Although some Tea Party-affiliated groups have taken a more tolerant attitude toward cuts in defense spending, they remain deeply unpopular with Republican-identified voters. A recent CNN poll found that just 29 percent of Republican voters would favor defense cuts as part of a debt ceiling deal. (Independent and Democratic voters differ: 50 and 56 percent of them favor defense cuts, respectively.)
The more relevant question, however, may be how Republicans regard defense cuts vis-a-vis tax increases, since that could be the choice put to them by the Joint Committee.A Pew Poll conducted in May, which divided respondents into nine political typologies, has one take on this question. In that survey, just 28 percent of voters in Republican-affiliated groups favored cuts to defense spending as part of a deficit-reduction package. But even fewer Republicans -- 19 percent -- were comfortable with raising taxes.
The CNN survey, which asked about tax increases in more detail, comes up with a different answer. In that poll, a of Republican respondents were in favor of some specific types of tax increases. Some 51 percent of Republicans favored raising taxes on those making at least $250,000 per year as part of a deal to raise the debt ceiling, for example, while 65 percent favored increasing the taxes paid by oil and gas companies.
In short, as a philosophical matter, tax increases are probably even more anathema to Republican voters than defense cuts. But as a practical matter the reverse may be true.
Defense cuts aren't unique in this regard. In general, spending cuts are preferred to tax increases in the abstract -- but not once you start to get specific. 
Not only were defense cuts objected to by large majorities of Republicans in the CNN poll, but so were cuts to Medicare (just 13 percent of Republicans were in favor) and to Social Security (18 percent in favor). Cuts to Medicaid, to farm subsidies, and to benefits for retired government workers were preferred to defense cuts -- but were nevertheless opposed by a majority of Republican voters in the poll.
These sentiments extend even to voters who say they support the Tea Party. In the poll, 44 percent of Tea Party supporters were in favor of increasing taxes on those making more than $250,000 per year. That compares to 38 percent of Tea Party voters who support cuts in defense spending and just 22 percent who said they favor Medicare cuts.
What the Republicans in Congress think, of course, may be an entirely different matter. Public opinion has so far had very little relationship to the choices that Washington has made in this debate.

HEADLINE: Reid Hopes for Sunday Night Debt Vote

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Voting quickly is not a hallmark of the Senate, and a debt ceiling deal has not been announced, but Mr. Reid expressed optimism as negotiations continued.

 BODY:
The Senate's top Democrat raised the possibility that his chamber might vote as early as Sunday night on a yet-to-be-announced debt ceiling compromise designed to avert a potential economic crisis this week.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, emerged from a two-hour meeting with other Democratic lawmakers and was asked whether the Senate would vote on a deal Sunday.
"I hope so," he told a swarm of reporters. 
A Sunday vote seemed unlikely just a few hours earlier as top lawmakers and the White House continued to work behind closed doors to finalize a debt agreement that would cut spending by more than $2.5 trillion and raise the debt ceiling into 2013.
The Department of Treasury has said it will exhaust its borrowing authority at midnight on Tuesday night if the debt ceiling is not increased.
Voting quickly is not a hallmark of the Senate, where procedures often slow the legislative work to a crawl. For Mr. Reid to move to a vote by Sunday evening would require plenty of cooperation from the Republican minority to waive several of those procedures.
But Democratic leadership aides said that they are "close" to a deal and that Senate Democrats are ready to present the plan to members of their caucus.
