HEADLINE: Mario Cuomo, Unusually Reserved

 BODY:
Reality governed rhetoric in Mario Cuomo's 11th annual address to the State Legislature. With no money around and none in sight, the Governor kept his proposals and promises to a minimum. The result was an unusually flat presentation for the grandiloquent Mr. Cuomo. He missed a chance to set an overarching theme for the new year. But he was wise not to raise false hopes for a recession-weary state.
His most provocative proposal was to let local school districts finance their share of education costs through local income taxes instead of property taxes. That wouldn't cost the state anything, but is likely to spark more debate than change. 
 Another proposal would create jobs by spending $25 billion on infrastructure over five years. That sounds original, but it includes the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's pending capital program as well as already allocated Federal highway money. Mr. Cuomo also called for reforms to eliminate excessive borrowing, a fairer allocation of state education funds and further streamlining of some state agencies. He hasn't put much muscle behind such worthy proposals in the past; maybe this year will be different.
He said he would oppose higher broad-based taxes like income taxes. But if the state is facing a budget gap of up to $4 billion, Mr. Cuomo will need to explain how he expects to avoid them. After several bruising budget years, can New Yorkers afford more service cuts? Mr. Cuomo's budget, due in two weeks, will no doubt reveal more.
The Governor's message has often been a dazzling exercise in the art of broad-brushing. This year, he made references to what he called "The New York Proposition" -- opportunity, liberty, responsibility and family. Otherwise he was all business. After all, the Republicans he loves to beat up on are leaving the White House and Mr. Cuomo no longer flirts with national office. He may also have sensed that grand flourishes would be inconsistent with modest times.

HEADLINE: Choosing a School for Chelsea

 BODY:
No one can reasonably argue with President-elect and Mrs. Clinton's desire to choose the school they think best for their daughter, Chelsea. That is their obligation as parents. But Mr. Clinton also had a larger obligation that he took on by campaigning as an advocate of public education. He has not served the spirit of that obligation by choosing a private school, and the handling of this family decision has provided ammunition for his opponents in the struggle to rebuild public schools.
The public schools are losing support because many middle-class parents have rushed to put their children in private schools. In settling on Sidwell Friends, an institution favored by affluent, liberal Democrats in Washington, the Clintons have joined that rush. Were there sound personal, educational and security reasons? Possibly. But according to news accounts, the Clintons did not even visit any public schools in the District of Columbia. 
 When one of the nation's staunchest advocates of public education chooses not to use those schools, he owes the public a clear, detailed explanation. Absent that explanation, educators and students in public schools have every reason to believe he views their institutions as second-rate -- and to question the President-elect's commitment.
That message was reinforced by the dishonest way in which the decision was announced. Mr. Clinton's spokesman, George Stephanopoulos, insisted that the Clintons "didn't reject public schools." But, of course, that is exactly what they did. The reasons were probably those that lead many middle- and upper-income parents -- even those who support public education as an important vehicle of social and economic mobility -- to opt for private or parochial schools for their own children.
The Washington schools are in big trouble. Five separate reports criticized them last year. An outside audit said the system was "unstable and mismanaged." And Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly said she would no longer throw "good money . . . after bad."
Not citing these problems as a factor in this decision damages Mr. Clinton's credibility. He has opposed taxpayer-financed vouchers that would help any student pay tuition at private or parochial schools. Now voucher proponents are needling him as a hypocrite who would prohibit poor families from making the same choice he has made. But that misses the point: Vouchers for private school tuition would drain tax dollars from the public schools, weakening them still further.
As a family, the Clintons have made a choice. That decision now makes it even more imperative that as President, Mr. Clinton fulfill his promise to restore and improve public schools so that all families will have better choices.

HEADLINE: New Cuban-Americans Also Oppose Castro;
Change Old Attitudes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "A Bridge to Cuba" (Op-Ed, Dec. 18), Prof. Ruth Behar, a second-generation Cuban-American, urges rapprochement with her native land. The United States should rethink its parochial mind-set and consider a more magnanimous attitude toward our neighbor. We should support the almost-unanimous United Nations resolution calling for an end to the Cuban embargo. 
 Fidel Castro won control of Cuba through a popularly supported revolution against the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. The Batista reign of narrow self-interest, ruthless exploitation or degradation of the Cuban peasantry for the benefit of a small plutocracy was replaced by a more benign dictatorship. Overwhelmed by fear of Communism, the United States condemned Mr. Castro, rather than the hated regime he replaced.
In retrospect, our defensive antagonism toward the small island nation at our doorstep appears inordinate. Had we been more reasonable or less parochial and extended at least a conditional hand of friendship to the young Fidel Castro, who knows what might have happened? The Bay of Pigs and missile crisis might never have occurred. Cuba might have lessened or avoided its servitude to Moscow. At any rate, in a matter of a few short years, there will be a new government in Cuba.
A small coterie based in Miami would like to hasten that day and substitute its own oligarchy to control the island's people and their future. A return to a Batistalike, far-right regime, however, is clearly not in the best interests of either Cuba or the United States. We can discourage these more polished despots and help assure a democratic successor to Fidel Castro if we extend a tentative hand of cooperation to the economically desperate Cuban people.
Persuasion and friendship are apt to be far more effective in promoting democracy than hostility and coercion. Tourism and trade would soften the hard edges of pride and prejudice, and benefit both economies.
Let us celebrate in meaningful and generous fashion the passing of narrow ideologies, the end of the cold war. We should act with self-confidence, rather than insecurity, as we discard another, symbolically important relic of that war. An era of a new and truer pan-Americanism should be encouraged.

HEADLINE: In the South Bronx, the Grass Roots Grow Up;
Organizations Born in Protest Uncomfortably Find They're Now the Establishment

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Nearly two decades ago, a band of urban homesteaders intent on blocking the city from demolishing the South Bronx apartment building they were painstakingly renovating linked arms, stood firm and stared down the city's bulldozers. They won the confrontation and their building, and in the process spawned the Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association, named for the curved block of Kelly Street where they made their stand.
Like pioneering urban groups all over the country, they succeeded where government had failed, providing spotless buildings, low-income cooperatives and greatly needed social services. And nowhere has that success been more evident than in the South Bronx, where Banana Kelly and others helped revive an area that arson and political inaction had consigned to the depths of urban chaos and despair. 
 Yet as they became major players in neighborhood development, taking problem buildings off the hands of the city and adding a slew of social services to their portfolio, these groups have been transformed into landlords and corporations caught between the community of their birth and the government agencies and foundations that sustain them.
In many ways, they have become like the very government they set out to fight. And some people worry that by doing so, the groups have lost some of their all-important edge.
"A lot of the groups have become, for better or worse, surrogates for government in terms of delivery of services and have become part of the establishment," said Harry DeRienzo, a founding organizer and past director of Banana Kelly who now provides assistance to other such groups. "It goes from a grass-roots organization responsible locally to one responsible to institutional needs and where its money comes from."
 
A New Role
 As the groups take on added management responsibilities, they are finding themselves in the sometimes uncomfortable position of having to evict free-loading tenants or others who sell drugs from their apartments. Like landlords anywhere, they also must deal with angry tenants and worry if rental income will cover the cost of repairs. And as providers of social services, they must balance their compassion for a client's problems with their organization's self-interest as a landlord.
They have changed and grown so much that about the only thing they don't do is the old-fashioned organizing that was the heart of their mission.
"We gave up our right to advocate and organize in this community," said Yolanda Rivera, Banana Kelly's executive director, whose group now has a multimillion-dollar budget and 92 employees. "It's the responsibility of the residents to organize like in the early days."
According to the National Center for Community Economic Development, an organization in Washington that assists these groups, the nation's 2,000 or so community-development corporations have developed more than 320,000 low-income apartments and helped create or keep more than 90,000 jobs.
The record of these groups is startlingly evident in areas like the Morrisania section of the Bronx, where Charlotte Street once cut a grim swath through a jumbled moonscape of empty lots and buildings weakened by neglect and the flight of many hard-working families.
This was the birthplace of the MBD Housing Development Corporation, a group started in the mid-1970's by local residents unwilling or unable to move from their community. The group's name came from its attitude -- desperate to see a change for the better, they called themselves the Mid-Bronx Desperadoes.
Alarmed by the seemingly incessant fires and lack of city services, residents banded together, trooped to various city agencies and demanded to know what plans those agencies had for the neighborhood. The frustrating reply was, in a word, none.
But an official at the Department of Housing Preservation and Development turned the tables on them and asked what plans they had. Over time, the group agreed to take over city-owned buildings, renovating and eventually managing them.
 
Taking the Place Of the Government
 "Most of the not-for-profits got started because of a lack of city policy and the city not having the will to implement any policy," said Genevieve Brooks, an organizer of the Mid-Bronx Desperadoes who is now the deputy borough president of the Bronx. "We saw what was wrong and saw an opportunity if we became part of the policy-making group. We could make a difference."
The changes are evident along blocks where MBD helped bring ranch houses with tidy lawns and clean sidewalks as well as rows of squat but well-kept town houses. A few blocks away, the fresh-scrubbed brick facades of renovated apartment buildings stand in contrast to the graffiti-marred walls of city housing projects across the street.
The successes have not gone unnoticed.
"Government learned a long time ago it is the most inefficient producer of housing," said Angelo J. Aponte, the Commissioner of the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal. "We found that community-based organizations had the pulse of the community. Groups like Banana Kelly and MBD have become very sophisticated as to what it takes to rehab and develop."
Part of the effectiveness of groups like MBD is the attention paid to sizing up prospective tenants, interviewing them and visiting their homes as part of the application process. The interviews give them a sense of the family's strengths and potential problems, some of which can be addressed through social services offered by the group in its buildings. The families range from single mothers fresh from the city's shelter system to blue-collar workers and elderly residents who have lived in the buildings for decades.
 
Suddenly Learning To Be Landlords
 But while they are seen as having a greater stake in their community's future than absentee landlords, the groups have nonetheless faced some of the same frustrations as landlords in low-income neighborhoods.
"The toughest part is the realization of having responsibilities that leave them in a quandary," said Getz Obstfeld, a former director of Banana Kelly who is now a consultant to community housing groups. "They realize that each apartment in that building costs X amount of money to run."
And while the line between good-guy tenants and bad-guy landlords was clearly drawn in their early days, the groups are now finding that life is not as simple when you're the landlord. It may be easy to rally against a landlord who is bleeding a building and neglecting repairs, but it is hard to pull tenants together around the complexities of housing finance or building management.
"The world for them has changed from black and white to very gray," said Mr. Obstfeld. "It's a hard position to be in when the values that created you and the tactics were protest and community mobilization. It's hard to mobilize people around gray issues."
Another concern is that groups will shy away from confronting city agencies on behalf of tenants if they are also relying on those same agencies for buildings and budgets. Some groups, like the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, have spun off independent housing-development corporations that allow the parent organization to maintain its focus on tenant organizing and advocacy.
In other cases, some groups have had to take elaborate steps to prevent information gathered by workers in the social-service arm of the organizations from being used against tenants in eviction proceedings by the landlord arm.
 
Some Complaints Sound the Same
 But even at its most basic, tenant-landlord relations have their own singular dynamic. Some of those difficulties can be seen at 783 Beck Street, a building renovated and managed by Banana Kelly. While sunken floors, rickety windows and loitering crackheads no longer plague the building, some of its tenants complain that Banana Kelly did a slipshod job and does not respond quickly enough to repair requests.
"They've gotten way over their head," said Rose Davis, part of whose bedroom ceiling collapsed because of water leaking from a faulty radiator upstairs. She said she told the superintendent of the leak before the collapse but was informed the repair would take at least a week.
The repair took three weeks. It was completed the week before Christmas.
"They've got too many buildings now," Ms. Davis said. "Now they're like a corporation, and you have to take a turn."
Ms. Rivera admitted that Banana Kelly had to balance repairs with rental income, but she said she hoped their experiences would point the way to new partnerships. In larger terms, she has been leading her group to re-examine its mission in hopes of getting the community more involved.
Banana Kelly and five other South Bronx groups are hoping to find those answers through their participation in the Comprehensive Community Revitalization Program, a $5.5 million demonstration project financed by the Surdna Foundation, a private philanthropic organization. The project hopes to help propel these groups into the next stage of their development -- coordinated planning for the economic, social and housing needs of the future.
In regular meetings, staff members from the various groups meet with one another as they discuss plans for their communities. They have brought in tenant leaders and made them part of a dialogue about how they see the community's future, zeroing in on needs for education, job training and new businesses, among others.
MBD is hoping to bring health-care centers to the neighborhood and to develop a sprawling tract north of East 174th Street into a large supermarket and other businesses that would employ hundreds from the community. Banana Kelly is also developing health care and day care, but it has taken the opposite approach to economic development, examining ways to help provide loans to residents.
Increasingly, Ms. Rivera of Banana Kelly talks about instilling in residents the skills and encouragement they need to organize themselves and take on a greater role in running their buildings and communities. It is being done partly through training sessions in "values clarification" and self-esteem, which are also a component of the Community Revitalization Program.
"People depend on the system to provide services," said Ms. Rivera. "But you have all the answers inside. You need to know and feel comfortable you can do this. We give them techniques they can use to understand the concept. If you have values, you have to do something about them. Values in a vacuum are irrelevant."
Some observers are skeptical of the training sessions, which are modeled after a successful program in Dade County, Florida, and criticize them for treating poverty as a pathology.
"I've got problems with it," said Chester Hartman, the executive director of the Poverty and Race Research Action Council, a Washington organization that assists community groups. "It puts the onus on the individual and not the system."
 
Sources of Money, Sources of Power
 He added that one reason why community groups are pursuing such classes is that they are in vogue among some foundation officials. His reservation is echoed by others, including some staff members at community organizations, who see the phenomenon as symptomatic of the problems these groups encounter during their growth: As overhead increases and programs expand, they become more responsive to their sources of money than to the immediate needs of the community.
Many directors of community-development corporations say they are keenly aware of these criticisms, but many admit it is a situation they have to make the most of, since there can be precious few resources to handle an ever-expanding workload.
"If we don't get paid, we can't deliver services," said Ralph Porter, the executive director of MBD. "If it wasn't for the needs of the community, we wouldn't be in existence either. Community-development corporations came into being because there is a need. The Hamptons don't have a community development corporation."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 11, 1993, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about community groups' role in the revitalization of the Bronx referred incorrectly to the financing of a program to help the groups plan. The Surdna Foundation did the initial work in developing the program -- the Comprehensive Community Revitalization Program -- but nine other foundations and corporations contributed money.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 36.20 for Steepest Loss in 3 Months

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
A late selloff in the bond market crumpled the stock market yesterday, leaving the Dow Jones industrial average with its largest one-day loss in three months.
The Dow closed down 36.20 points, or 1.1 percent, to 3,268.96, with the broader market off almost as much. Volume, at 304.9 million shares, exceeded 300 million for only the third time in the last year, as the decline accelerated in the last hour of trading. 
 Just as many investors had let their optimism about the new Clinton Administration guide their buying since the election, some analysts said, many gave in to their fears yesterday after the President-elect backed away from his pledge to halve the budget deficit in four years.
With stocks already expensive relative to their dividends and earnings, said Byron R. Wien, a Morgan Stanley strategist, their prices react violently to disappointments. "In a market that's tender anyway," he said, "investors shifted from being complacent to being concerned."
Prices in the bond market fell first, with the yield on the 30-year treasury bond rising 9 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.44 percent. Heavy borrowing by the Government to cover the budget deficit tends to raise interest rates, and higher rates make the returns available from stocks less attractive relative to bonds.
Philip Smyth, an analyst at Birinyi Associates, said that sell programs accounted for about 25 points of the Dow's decline. Although these programs are used in sophisticated trading strategies, the underlying cause was the rise in interest rates, he said. Other things being equal, yesterday's higher bond yields lowered the relative value of the Standard & Poor's 500 stocks by a good deal more than 1 percent, he said, even more than this average actually declined.
A report that weekly unemployment insurance claims reached their lowest level in four years contributed to the bond market's decline but initially raised investors' hopes for a stronger recovery. Until early afternoon, the stock market was slightly ahead.
Many of the Dow stocks fell a point or more by the close, with Alcoa losing 2, to 70 5/8; Woolworth, 1 7/8, to 30 1/4, and I.B.M., 1, to 47, reaching lows last seen in the mid-1970's.
A big loser in over-the-counter trading was Hunter Environmental Services, which lost 411/16 , to close at 1, after the Texas Water Commission denied its application to build a toxic-waste disposal site outside Houston.
 
Gains in Transportation
 Among the market's few sources of support, some economically sensitive stocks, especially in transportation, finished the day with gains, as the Dow Jones transportation average rose 12.49, or 0.85 percent, to 1480.23.
Airlines and railroads depend on the domestic market for most of their business, so they are more likely to profit from a recovery than manufacturers with heavy sales abroad.
Philip Morris, up 3/4, to 72 5/8, on volume that led the Big Board, arrested its sharp decline with a public relations offensive. A senior executive attacked news reports concerning the health effects of cigarettes and said that 1992 earnings improved about 20 percent.
A continuing rally in Intel, up 1 yesterday, to 99 5/8, on heavy volume, helped the Nasdaq composite average finish with only about half the percentage loss of the Dow. The Nasdaq average fell 3.64, or 0.53 percent, to 678.21.

HEADLINE: Push by U.S. To Cut Tariffs Is Reported

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
In a change of tactics, the Bush Administration is secretly trying to strike a deal by the end of next week to bring about a reduction in tariffs around the world, American and European officials said today.
As the Bush Administration draws to a close, its officials are eager to achieve success in one of the few foreign policy arenas that has consistently frustrated them for four years. But they insist that they will not make unnecessary concessions or sacrifice America's economic interests for the sake of a quick deal. 
 If a deal is made, it will eventually result in lower prices for billions of consumers on a wide range of goods -- from basic clothing to fine crystal -- and remove one of the biggest remaining obstacles to a comprehensive world trade agreement.
A worldwide agreement would, in all likelihood, act as a strong stimulus to the global economy.
 
Vigorous Effort Reported
 Some officials involved in the talks cautioned that many differences remained, and a senior Administration trade official said he doubted the effort would succeed. But others said it was the most vigorous since the United States and the Europeans reached a farm subsidies agreement two months ago, and success could not be ruled out.
The new negotiating began Saturday, when Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, made an unannounced visit to London. She met there with Sir Leon Brittan, a British politician and free-trade enthusiast who is now the European Community's Commissioner for External Affairs, including trade negotiations.
Mrs. Hills and Sir Leon reviewed the stalemate and are said to have concluded that the best way to make progress now was to shift the center of attention to tariffs from free-trade rules, like allowing banks and insurance companies to do business across national frontiers.
As a result, Bush Administration officials are working out proposals to reduce hundreds of specific American import taxes, or tariffs, in exchange for matching cuts in foreign tariffs that hurt overseas sales of American goods. The proposals will be carried to Geneva on Friday by a team of Mrs. Hills's senior aides, said officials who insisted on anonymity.
Mrs. Hills has been personally handling even the most minute details with only a handful of her top aides, excluding many Administration officials normally involved in such talks.
"There are three who know precisely what we're going to do and those are Carla Hills, Jules Katz and Warren Lavorel," one official said. Mr. Katz is senior deputy trade representative; Mr. Lavorel is another top American negotiator.
 
Stress Shifted to Tariffs
 The Americans and Europeans have "had conversations every day this week, some on the telephone and some face to face," the official added. The United States, he said, shifted its emphasis to tariffs in response to renewed European interest.
A trans-Atlantic deal would be tantamount to a worldwide tariff agreement, such is the economic power of the American and European blocs.
The breakthrough sought by the Bush Administration by the end of next week would put pressure on the Clinton Administration to finish the overall talks soon after it takes office, before the negotiating authority from Congress expires on March 2.
But the Bush Administration has told the Clinton transition team almost nothing about the details, one Democrat complained, and Clinton aides have shown little enthusiasm for dealing with the complicated negotiations in their first 100 days in office. Instead, they hope to focus on domestic issues.
Mrs. Hills has pointed out repeatedly that President Bush remains legally in charge until the inauguration of Bill Clinton on Jan. 20, and that Mr. Clinton endorsed the Bush Administration's continued handling of trade matters after he won the election.
Farm subsidies, tariffs and free-trade rules have been the major issues in the talks aimed at broadening the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a series of free-trade pacts. Until now, however, tariffs have been largely ignored. The United States and the European Community have very different sets of these import taxes, and, as a result, different priorities in the negotiations.
The United States has negligible tariffs on most manufactured goods and raw materials but is extremely protective of a few low-skill industries that employ thousands of people, with tariffs of 20 percent or more on imports of products like household glassware and apparel. The European Community has tariffs of 5 or 10 percent on a broad range of manufactured goods and raw materials that the United States produces.
The European Community wants to reduce a few of the highest tariffs on both sides, while the United States seeks the complete elimination of already low tariffs on many goods.

HEADLINE: PEROT TO USE TV TO PROMOTE GROUP

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Texas billionaires don't fade away, it would seem. They just keep coming back on TV.
No matter that the campaign is long over. On Monday, Ross Perot returns to his favorite venues: a news conference in Dallas followed by CNN's "Larry King Live," where it all began. Then ABC's "Good Morning America" Tuesday and NBC's "Today" program on Thursday. 
 Since there is no longer an election to talk about, Mr. Perot will talk up his grass-roots organization, United We Stand, America. For $15 a year, he will tell viewers, they can be part of his group, which says it is promoting issues Mr. Perot emphasized during the campaign, like deficit reduction.
"He'll be making sure that we get more than just promises on the national economy," said Sharon Holman, the spokeswoman for United We Stand.
 
Link to Inauguration Denied
 Ms. Holman said Mr. Perot's plan had nothing to do with President-elect Bill Clinton's imminent inauguration -- that his only motivation was to begin the membership drive.
Although the President-elect has been solicitous of Mr. Perot's supporters, he has apparently felt little compulsion to seek the advice of Mr. Perot, the independent Presidential candidate who got about 19 percent of the vote.
He did not invite Mr. Perot to his economic conference in Little Rock last month. But few would doubt that Mr. Perot will reprise his favorite lines about the deficit, urging the new President (as he urged the old one) to get "under the hood of the car, working on the engine."
Mr. King, who saw his audience shoot up with Mr. Perot's countless appearances last year, has high hopes for Monday night. "In a weird kind of way, people miss him," he said. "It won't be as fervent as in the heat of the campaign, but there will always be interest in Ross Perot. Whatever that potion is that goes into a television screen and beams out to make people attracted to him, Perot has it."
Mr. Perot's plans to return to the cameras suggest that for television viewers, this year may not seem much different from the campaign year. Already, Mr. Clinton has made no secret that he intends to run a permanent campaign out of the White House.
 
'Probably Bored'
 But Edward J. Rollins, who briefly served as Mr. Perot's campaign co-chairman before the two turned on each other, said his former boss may find that he will not get as much attention in the shadows of a new President.
"Obviously, he is probably bored being out of the limelight," Mr. Rollins said. "Usually in a campaign you try to motivate people to do something. What is his motivation here, except to get his ego stroked?"
But he said it would be a mistake for Mr. Perot to attack the incoming President. "In the honeymoon period," Mr. Rollins said, "there wouldn't be many people who would listen to him."
Indeed, Mr. King said, "I don't think you're going to see him come on and blast Clinton. But the public's going to be interested in what he thinks of the Cabinet."
Mr. Perot drew a larger share of the vote than any third-party or independent Presidential candidate since Theodore Roosevelt in 1912. Ms. Holman described United We Stand as a nonpartisan organization that would not endorse candidates or make contributions but might issue report cards on candidates' voting records.
It should come as no surprise that Mr. Perot's return to television next week will not be his last appearance, Ms. Holman said. "He'll be highly visible," Ms. Holman said. Does Mr. Perot miss the attention? "You'd have to ask him," Ms. Holman said.

HEADLINE: Audit of Government Says Billions Are Being Wasted

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
The top Federal auditor told President-elect Bill Clinton today that the Government did "an abysmal job of rudimentary bookkeeping" and had tens of billions of dollars in hidden liabilities.
In a series of 45 transition reports, Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, the head of the General Accounting Office, painted a grim picture of a Government plagued by mismanagement, unable to collect delinquent taxes and unwilling to acknowledge the full cost of its long-term commitments. 
 He said the State Department, the Transportation Department, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Health Care Financing Administration and the Energy Department were losing billions of dollars a year because they were lax in supervising Federal contractors who build embassies, subways and satellites, pay Medicare claims and run Government laboratories.
"Widespread financial management weaknesses are crippling the ability of our leaders to effectively run the Federal Government," Mr. Bowsher said.
The Comptroller General has historically been a nonpartisan official appointed by the President. Mr. Bowsher was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 for a 15-year term.
 
Poor Bookkeeping
 The Government, he said, spends $1.5 trillion a year but does "an abysmal job of rudimentary bookkeeping," using unreliable, ineffective techniques to control the flow of money.
As a flagrant example, Mr. Bowsher cited an Agriculture Department program that lends money to farmers. Under the program, run by the Farmers Home Administration, farmers are delinquent on more than one-third of the $20.5 billion in outstanding loans, and "borrowers who have defaulted on past loans are free to obtain new loans," he said.
Federal officials "seem to believe that keeping farmers on the land is more important than making prudent lending decisions," he said.
In another example, Mr. Bowsher said the Government did not properly supervise private insurance companies that process claims under Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly. These contractors "focus more on paying claims quickly than on reviewing the accuracy of payments," he said. In many cases, he said, the Medicare contractors fail to investigate beneficiaries' complaints about fraud by doctors, laboratories and other services.
Likewise, Mr. Bowsher criticized the Energy Department for its supervision of companies that produce nuclear weapons and operate national laboratories for the Government. Under some of these arrangements, he said, the Government must reimburse contractors for money and materials stolen by the contractors' employees and must pay fines incurred by contractors for violating environmental laws.
The Comptroller General's original role, when the General Accounting Office was created in 1921, was to rule on the legality of Government spending. But in recent years the office has spent more and more time analyzing the quality of programs. With a staff of 5,090 employees, the Comptroller General has virtually unlimited power to investigate Government operations.
In the reports, Mr. Bowsher warned Mr. Clinton against relaxing Federal regulation of banks, as the industry and some Clinton advisers have recommended as a way to stimulate the economy by encouraging lending. But Mr. Bowsher said the current inspection of banks by regulators was inadequate to assess "the safety and soundness of bank operations," or to provide early warning of problems.
In fact, Mr. Bowsher recommended new banking regulations. He suggested that Congress should set accounting standards for delinquent loans if the accounting profession did not voluntarily adopt tougher standards.
 
4 Years Since Last Study
 Congress asked Mr. Bowsher in November to analyze the issues facing the new President. In December 1988, Mr. Bowsher gave the President-elect, George Bush, a report that urged him to address domestic problems neglected by the Reagan Administration and said the costs would be staggering.
Now, in the new reports, Mr. Bowsher said the problems and the costs of fixing them had risen sharply.
Mr. Bowsher also warned that the $290 billion Federal deficit in 1992 -- up from $155 billion in 1988 -- understated the fiscal squeeze. He said the shortfall of $386 billion in the Government's operating accounts last year was partly offset by a surplus of $96 billion in trust funds like Social Security.
"This trust fund surplus is a temporary phenomenon that will begin to evaporate within the next 20 years as the baby boom retires," he wrote.
Mr. Bowsher said tax increases were likely to be part of "any credible strategy to reduce the deficit" because "growth in revenues has not kept pace with Federal spending."
The Comptroller General said it would be very difficult for Mr. Clinton to cut the deficit in half in four years, as he promised in the Presidential campaign. "It's more important that he have a plan over a longer period, that he persevere and get the job done," Mr. Bowsher said today in an interview.
He said the experience of the last four years showed that his earlier warnings had been conservative. He noted that recently the inspectors general at several agencies reached similar conclusions after doing their own audits and investigations.
 
Solutions Cost More Now
 In 1988, he said it would cost $100 billion to $130 billion to modernize and clean up the nation's nuclear weapon production plants. In his new report, he puts the cost at $160 billion.
In 1988, Mr. Bowsher said it would cost $50 billion or more for the Government to take over insolvent savings and loan associations, dispose of their assets and pay off depositors. Today he said, "Estimates of the eventual cost to taxpayers of the savings and loan cleanup exceed $300 billion."
In 1988, he said it would cost as much as $14 billion to clean up toxic wastes dumped by Defense Department installations. In his new report, he put the cost at $24.5 billion.
Mr. Bowsher also warned that "current welfare reform efforts may falter or fail." In the late 1980's, Congress, with support from Mr. Clinton, among other Governors, passed several laws to help poor families get job training and jobs. But the laws have not been fully carried out because of rising case loads and state budget constraints," he said.
Finally, the Comptroller General said the savings from military cutbacks would prove elusive. He said: "Our work shows that many of the assumed savings may not materialize. The Defense Department may be faced with additional program reductions of nearly $100 billion."

HEADLINE: Clinton to Meet Today With Mexican Leader

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico will not try to settle their highly complicated differences on North American trade issues when they meet Friday, Democrats and Mexican officials said this week.
George Stephanopoulos, the communications director for Mr. Clinton's transition team, said the meeting in Austin, Tex., would cover immigration and foreign-aid issues as well as the North American Free Trade Agreement, which would eliminate trade barriers among the United States, Canada and Mexico. 
 But Mr. Clinton's Cabinet nominees and Mexico's senior trade negotiators will not attend the session, which both sides described as an opportunity for the two to get to know each other.
 
Mexicans Rooted for Bush
 The meeting is intended partly to mend ties after the American election campaign, when Mexican officials rooted for the re-election of President Bush, Democrats said. Mr. Salinas sat with Mr. Bush in July at the All-Star baseball game in San Diego, which Republicans saw at the time as an opportunity to woo Hispanic voters.
But no details on the free-trade pact will be worked out until officials from all three countries come together, Mr. Stephanopoulos said.
He also said Mr. Clinton had called Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada today and invited him to meet shortly after the inauguration in the first meeting of the Clinton Presidency with any foreign leader.
Mr. Clinton said on Oct. 4 that he would not sign legislation putting the North American pact into law until he had negotiated three supplemental agreements with Mexico and made five changes in American law. The agreements would cover labor and environmental issues and the reimposition of tariffs if imports surge.
 
Language Still Undecided
 The changes would increase spending on workers who lose their jobs because of imports; spend more money on environmental cleanup; help farmers shift away from crops that Mexico grows more efficiently; tighten licensing requirements for Mexican truck drivers who cross the border, and raise barriers to the immigration of strikebreakers.
But the Clinton transition has not yet decided how these broad principles should be translated into legal language, Democrats said.
One important unresolved question is how to raise the money to help people who may lose their jobs because of imports from Mexico or because of the relocation of American factories to Mexico. Economic studies have consistently shown that while the agreement may create more jobs than it destroys, the job losses could nonetheless approach 200,000 over the next few years.

Aspin Questions Bush Estimates on Arms Budget

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton's choice for Defense Secretary, Representative Les Aspin, said today that the Bush Administration's military budget for the next six years may overestimate savings and underestimate weapons costs.
The estimates are significant because Mr. Clinton promised to cut $60 billion out of Mr. Bush's budget of $1.42 trillion for the fiscal years 1992 through 1997. 
 If Mr. Bush's anticipated savings cannot be achieved or if weapons cost more than planned, the Clinton Administration will face the hard choice of cutting more from military spending to make up the difference or scaling back planned cuts to avoid broader troop reductions and layoffs by Pentagon contractors.
 
$60 Million Error?
 Mr. Aspin said that one of his first acts as Defense Secretary would be to sort out the budget figures.
"Are we talking about a realistic number from which the President-elect has pledged to cut $60 billion, or are we talking about something else?" Mr. Aspin asked.
The Bush Administration, for example, contends it can save $71 billion by 1997 through internal cost-cutting steps, like consolidating supply depots and changing accounting procedures. But some Pentagon officials say those measures will save only $10 billion to $20 billion.
Mr. Aspin, a Wisconsin Democrat, began his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee today by outlining what he sees as the four big dangers facing American security interests in the post-cold war world: weakened control over nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union, regional conflicts, failed reform in the former Soviet republics and sluggish economic growth in the United States.
The 54-year-old chairman of the House Armed Services Committee sailed through today's hearing, easily fielding questions from senators he has dealt with for years and handling subjects as varied as homosexuals in the military and the use of force in Iraq and Bosnia.
But the voluble Mr. Aspin, who typically dispenses his ideas and opinions freely, was under strict orders from the Clinton camp not to say anything controversial. As a result, he declined to comment on several sensitive issues, including women in combat and the possibility of American air strikes against Serbian targets in Bosnia, until the new cabinet could convene.
Today also marked the beginning of a new relationship between Mr. Aspin and Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee. As respective chairmen of the House and Senate panels controlling military programs, the two lawmakers have for years been co-equals, horse trading pet programs and policy compromises. Now, as the Defense Secretary-designate, Mr. Aspin will depend largely on Mr. Nunn and his colleagues for the Pentagon's annual budget.
 
Conciliatory Tone
 Mr. Aspin offered an olive branch to the armed services, whose senior leaders view him suspiciously because he supports a 1.4 million-member military by 1995, which is 200,000 fewer troops than President Bush has proposed. "We will not lose sight of our first duty -- the maintenance of sound, ready, effective forces," Mr. Aspin said in concluding his opening statement.
While refusing to discuss his personal recommendations on military options in Bosnia, Mr. Aspin said the end of the cold war had changed the calculations behind the use of force.
Critics of air strikes against Serbian positions have feared that if aerial bombardment failed to reverse Serbian policies, ground troops would have to be sent in as a natural escalation of force.
"Maybe you use force not to achieve something but to punish people for doing certain things," Mr. Aspin said. "If it doesn't work, the backing off of it doesn't have the same kind of international concerns."
 
Divisive Issues Addressed
 Among social issues affecting the military, Mr. Clinton's promise to lift the ban on homosexuals in the armed services has raised howls of protest from service members and senior officers. Mr. Aspin said as Defense Secretary he would carry out the new policy, but "very carefully and very deliberately."
"From an equity and fairness standpoint, I think there's some real problems with the way the policy is going right now," he said. "We're going to be dealing with this thing in the next four years, no matter what. Either we deal with it forthrightly and well, or backhandedly and bumble it."
Mr. Aspin also defended Mr. Clinton's plan to shrink the military and the Pentagon, and he said pressures to make deeper cuts are coming from lawmakers who do not have military installations or weapons plants in their districts.
"The current situation in Congress right now is not a split between hawks and doves, between liberals and conservatives, between Democrats and Republicans," Mr. Aspin said. "It's between those people that have military bases and facilities in their districts and those who don't."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Deficit and Economic News Batter the Treasury Market

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury bonds and notes plunged yesterday as traders and investors got a glimpse of a slightly stronger economy. And they may also have begun to peek at the huge deficit in the Federal budget that President Bush proposed on Wednesday and wonder about President-elect Bill Clinton's commitment to reducing it.
Traders said a lot of selling was also prompted by the need to reduce the risk of losses from the billions of dollars in new corporate bonds that dealers issued this week. This was accomplished by selling Treasury securities as a hedge. More than $4.1 billion of new corporate issues were sold yesterday, bringing the total for the week to $10.4 billion. 
 The price of the 30-year bond was off more than a point, and the yield jumped to 7.44 percent, more than wiping out the gains from a rally on Monday. The yield on Wednesday was 7.35 percent. The rally at the beginning of the week pushed the yield down to 7.32 percent from 7.39 percent on Dec. 31.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell more then 3/4 point, and the yield rose to 6.73 percent, from 6.61 percent on Wednesday; the yield on the five-year note jumped to 6.04 percent from 5.92 percent.
The bond selloff also depressed stock prices. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 36.20 points, its largest one-day loss in three months, to close at 3,268.96. [Page D4.]
The bond market has been behaving abnormally recently, but yesterday's rout seemed to be a return to normal -- for at least a day.
Despite economic data that show the economy growing, prices of Treasury bonds and notes rose recently. Normally, economic growth would worry investors and traders because it would signal rising inflation. But many investors had decided that more growth was positive because it would mean Mr. Clinton could scale back plans to stimulate the economy through spending and tax incentives.
At the same time, investors seemed to become unusually comfortable with the President-elect, a Democrat, and his commitment to reducing the record Federal deficit.
"Those arguments got tired" yesterday, said Jay Goldinger, a government bond trader at Capital Insight in Los Angeles.
The day started with a report of a very sharp decline in initial claims for unemployment insurance, reflecting an improvement in the economy that was better than expected. Claims fell by 40,000 in the week ended Dec. 26, to 291,000, the lowest level since April 1989.
To make matters worse, the report came the day before the Labor Department's release of the monthly employment report, which always makes the market nervous.
Some investors and traders were also beginning to look at the projections of a deficit of $300 billion to $400 billion, based on the budget that President Bush sent to Congress on Wednesday. Comments from Mr. Clinton's staff indicating that the President-elect would have to go slower than planned on cutting the deficit also did not help.
John Costas, the managing director of government trading at First Boston, said he was beginning to see a change in the market's thinking. The focus, he said, had been on the slow increase in job growth and the fact that the economy would not accelerate too quickly. This meant no immediate inflationary threat, which would normally push bond prices lower.
But he said some people were talking more about the demand for capital as the economy grows and private capital borrowing demands increase. With the deficit at record levels and moving higher, there could be a scramble for credit that would push interest rates higher.
"Just because you are not having a lot of hiring does not mean there will not be a demand for credit," he said.
The market for new corporate issues was dominated yesterday by the World Bank, Time Warner and RJR Nabisco.
The 30-year World Bank issue was priced to yield 7.669 percent, or about 28 basis points more than the Treasury's 30-year benchmark issue. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The 20-year Time Warner bonds were priced to yield 9.125 percent, about 175 basis points more than the 30-year Treasury. The 7-year RJR notes were priced to yield 8.095 percent, about 167.5 basis points more than the when-issued seven-year Treasury note.

HEADLINE: Retailers' Holidays: Happy Indeed

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The nation's chain stores yesterday reported stunningly strong sales in December, their best holiday season since 1988.
Retailers had anticipated moderate gains for the Christmas season, but few had predicted sales as vigorous as they turned out to be. And even the most optimistic were surprised by the results. 
 "Sales were not good -- they were great," said Edward Johnson, director of the Johnson Redbook Service, a publication of Lynch, Jones & Ryan, a New York brokerage firm, that monitors the performance of retail companies. He was one of the few analysts who had predicted outstanding sales growth. "The consumer came out of the closet," he said.
 
 
Lower Sales Ahead?
 Sales are likely to slow in the first quarter of this year, for several reasons. Retailers managed their inventories well during the holidays, so they have relatively few goods left to mark down. Conversely, last year they had so much merchandise to clear out at cut-rate prices that sales soared in January and February. Any gains early this year are likely to pale in comparison.
Behind the surge were many shoppers who had locked their credit cards in the family safe to reduce their debt, but pulled them out for the holidays. "We're wondering whether there won't be some credit card panic this month when people get their bills," Mr. Johnson said.
And many people who ran up bills in December, anticipating their income-tax refunds early this year, may be disappointed to find that their refunds will be smaller than usual. The Bush Administration adjusted the Federal tax-withholding tables to put more money in consumers' pockets last year.
Still, analysts say that retailers have little to fear at the start of the new year, with lean inventories that will protect their profit margins. Retail companies that have languished for the last few years now have reason to celebrate.
"Strong sales coupled with an absence of the price promoting of the last several years and a much more disciplined approach to management made this Christmas a barn-burner," said Jeffrey M. Feiner, a retail analyst at Salomon Brothers.
The Salomon Brothers retail index, which tracks the monthly sales of 22 large retailers and compiles them in a weighted average, rose 8 percent in December. Most analysts and merchants were expecting sales gains of 4 to 6 percent.
 For the five weeks that ended on Saturday, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the country's largest retail chain, posted its best comparable-store sales gains in five years, rising 10 percent above the previous year's level.
Sales at Sears, Roebuck & Company stores open at least a year jumped 8.2 percent, well beyond the company's 5 percent goal. Analysts watch sales in stores open at least a year, known as comparable-store sales, more closely than total sales, because they are a more accurate indicator of a retail chain's performance.
 
 
Big-Ticket Items
 While Sears said sales were strong in all of its departments, home office equipment, video games and furniture were among the goods that led the surge.
After a two-year slump, the Limited, the specialty-store operator that has battled to increase sales this year, had comparable-store sales gains of 9 percent.
 The December reports from some retailers were not so good. The Gap, which routinely earned double-digit sales gains during the recession by making white T-shirts and blue jeans newly fashionable, had a 5 percent sales increase at stores open at least a year, and the company warned that a good portion of those sales came at the expense of profits.
And Kmart discount stores in the United States had a meager 2.3 percent increase in comparable-store sales. At the specialty stores that the Kmart Corporation operates, which include Waldenbooks and the Sports Authority, sales were up 2.2 percent in stores open at least a year. Over all, sales for the corporation were up 2.4 percent.
"While sales in December were at an all-time high, they were slightly under plan, reflecting reduced promotional activity in the U.S. Kmart division," said the chairman and chief executive of the company, Joseph E. Antonini.
He was quick to add that good inventory management, which helped the company match sales to demand, would make Christmas 1992 the most profitable holiday in Kmart's history.
 
Department Stores Surge
 Target, the Dayton Hudson Corporation's discount chain, struggled, like Kmart, until last-minute shoppers lifted its sales just before Christmas. Sales rose 8 percent at Target stores that were open at least a year.
Department store chains, which consumers all but abandoned for discount stores and mass merchants during the recession, celebrated their best monthly sales increases of the year. The Neiman Marcus Group's same-store sales climbed 10.1 percent as shoppers splurged on expensive apparel. Federated Department Stores Inc., which operates Bloomingdale's, Rich's and seven other department store chains, had a 10 percent gain in comparable-store sales.
This was the first holiday season in three years in which stores specializing in trend-setting fashion merchandise, like Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdale's, Express, Ann Taylor and J. C. Penney, outperformed many of the leading discounters.
"With the snapback in consumer spending, spending on apparel snapped back, too," said Wayne Hood, a retailing analyst at Prudential Securities. "It's so noticeable because consumers held off buying apparel for so long."
And gift givers did not neglect retailers specializing in home electronics, computers, furniture and other, longer-lasting merchandise. Circuit City Stores Inc., a consumer electronics retailer, had a 9 percent increase in sales at stores open at least one year. Its chief national competitor, the Best Buys Company, posted a 13 percent sales increase at its comparable stores.

HEADLINE: Weicker's Statewide School Plan Could Resolve Hartford Bias Suit

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST HARTFORD, Conn., Jan. 7

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s call for a statewide school-integration effort will not end a suit challenging segregation in Hartford's schools, but it could lead to a resolution of the suit that would avoid a court imposing a desegregation plan on the state capital and its suburbs.
The outlines of Mr. Weicker's plan, lawyers for the plaintiffs in the suit said today, meet one of their basic requirements, that integration be approached on a regional basis. 
 But equally important, they said, the Governor, in his address to the General Assembly on Wednesday, acknowledged the state's responsibility to eliminate segregation even if it is unintentional, a result not of laws, but of housing patterns, poverty, or town lines drawn hundreds of years ago.
That acknowledgement, said one of the plaintiffs' lawyers, John C. Brittain, opened a door for the plaintiffs to discuss with state officials the details of an integration bill that is to be submitted to the Legislature in February.
 
A Sticking Point Is Removed
 "One sticking point was liability," Mr. Brittain said today of talks with state officials before the trial opened. "The state can't admit it, and we can't afford to waive it."
The Governor's statement that the state must address the segregation regardless of who or what is responsible for it "largely eliminates that obstacle," Mr. Brittain said.
In the trial in Superior Court, lawyers for the state continue to argue that the state is not responsible for the segregation in Hartford's schools, where 90 percent of the children are from minority groups and half are on welfare.
Now that the Governor has made a major proposal, Mr. Brittain said, "Why not talk?"
"Ideally it would be best to go to the Legislature with a proposal jointly sponsored by the administration and the plaintiffs," he said.
While testimony in the suit is likely to conclude before a bill is introduced, legislation endorsed by the plaintiffs would be similar to a settlement. It would lay out a mutually agreed upon goal, a process and a timetable for integrating the schools.
Since his election campaign in 1990, Mr. Weicker has expressed concern over the growing segregation of schools in Connecticut's cities. His address to legislators, challenging them to uphold the State Constitution's guarantee of an equal public education for everyone, staked out the moral issue of equal opportunity while pointing out the economic benefits of providing all children with a good education.
"There's not enough money in all of Connecticut for the jails that will be," he concluded, after noting that Connecticut is projected to build many more jails than schools this decade.
Mr. Weicker called for dividing Connecticut into six regions, within which towns and cities would develop plans to balance the racial makeup of their schools starting in the 1995-96 school year.
He offered few specifics, other than that the planning process would preserve local control, that towns could consider many options and that the state would help.
 
Statewide Solution Sought
 Mr. Weicker has emphasized that he wants a statewide solution. In a news conference today he did not mention negotiations with lawyers in the Hartford lawsuit. His spokeswoman, Avice Meehan, said he would not comment on the suit.
For many residents, however, the Governor's speech brought to life the issues that have been slowly taking shape in Superior Court in this Hartford suburb, where Judge Harry Hammer has heard three weeks of testimony in the suit known as Sheff v. O'Neill.
The idea that Simsbury, where 95.9 percent of the students are white, or Wethersfield, where 94.4 percent are white, might soon have to strike some balance with Hartford suddenly was made real. Similar racial disparities, along with sharp differences in wealth, exist across the state.
Mr. Weicker's proposals come as no surprise to the state's educators, however, and his call for towns to begin discussing regional integration plans by this fall does not catch them unprepared, especially in the Hartford area, which has been living with the Sheff case for four years.
Part of the case that Mr. Brittain and his colleagues are trying to build rests on reports prepared by the State Department of Education in 1988 and 1989 documenting the growing segregation in the state and describing ways it could be addressed.
The first recommendation of the 1988 report was "that the state, through administrative and legislative means, endorse the concept of 'collective responsibility' for desegregating the public schools."
 
Some Work Undertaken
 The state, witnesses for the plaintiffs have testified, never acted on that or other recommendations. But school superintendents have been studying them carefully, so Mr. Weicker's call for quick action this week did not dismay them, many of them said.
In the Hartford area, superintendents have been meeting for several years to develop programs that bring city and suburban children together. "Small things," said Stephen Tegarden, the Superintendent in Glastonbury, "but certainly in the spirit of cooperation and collaboration. The dialogue has begun."
The superintendents, however, have even undertaken what some describe as war games, in the event of a court desegregation order. "We've taken some time and played out different scenarios," Mr. Tegarden said, " 'what if a judge says do this by such and such a date,' that sort of thing."
The officials, he said, identified half a dozen "critical success factors" in carrying out any such plan, and now Mr. Weicker has led to the start of informational initiatives.
"A lot of them," Mr. Tegarden said, "have to do with getting information out and educating our residents."

'Main St.' Not Stirred By Change In the Wind

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Thomas Caviness isn't going. He isn't in the mood.
Bernadine Carie is curious, but she hasn't quite caught the spirit. 
 Along Georgia Avenue, which is Bill Clinton's designated symbol of the real America in the capital, they might as well be watching the birth of the Clinton Administration from Kalamazoo. To hear the the people along Georgia Avenue discuss it, the inauguration, just four miles and two weeks away, feels like a coming attraction at the cineplex in suburban Silver Spring.
Mr. Clinton's high-energy inaugural machine has been busily pumping up its five-day festival of symbolism, a high-concept political mini-series starring Mr. Clinton and his family, with appearances by Jefferson, Lincoln, the Liberty Bell and the American people. But it just doesn't matter much to Georgia Avenue.
Untouched by the hoopla, they listen to the radio's daily broadcasts on ticket availability (it's slim pickin's). Bill Clinton touched them deeply when he visited their stores shortly after his election, bridging the gap between the marble grandeur of Pennsylvania Avenue and the brick and boards of their own neighborhood. They are happy to see the same spirit in his inauguration. But they aren't exactly excited.
"You have to be in the mood," said Mr. Caviness, 68, owner of Tynisha's Art and Gift shop, as he photocopied some of the press clippings from Mr. Clinton's mid-November visit to his block of black, blue-collar Washington. "Some of this is a quest for publicity, and some of it is an attempt to send a message that he's a down-to-earth President. But I'm not going. I have little use for crowds."
"I haven't really decided if I want to go," said Ms. Carie, a hairdresser, as she spun Justina Cunningham's hair around a curler.
She was pleased, though, that 9-year-old Tiara Dews will be going "to everything," as her grandmother Mary Dews said. Tiara and her mother, Cheri Dews, are going to be part of the Faces of Hope lunch, and Tiara is attending an inaugural ball (one of 11) in a "special designer gown" paid for by the inaugural committee.
A few miles away, Richard Mintz, communications director for the Presidential Inaugural Committee, was describing the process as "like putting together a Fortune 500 Company." His committee should not to be confused with the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Celebrations or any of the dozens of unofficial events that are using the "inaugural" name.
The official events alone are enough to cause a run on Roman numerals. There's Inaugural I: The Bus Ride, Inaugural II: The Bell-Ringing, and Inaugural III: The Fireworks.
And that's just on Sunday, Jan. 17, well before the Diplomatic Reception, the Reunion on the Mall, the four formal dinners, the concerts at the Capital Center, the Salutes (to Children and Youth) at the Kennedy Center and the actual inauguration at the United States Capitol on Wednesday at 11:30 A.M., with a crowd of 250,000 looking on.
On the unofficial side, the celebration of promise is also a celebration of political and economic pragmatism.
For instance, the Arkansas State Society has arranged a gala event for the home-state folk. The organization rounded up money from nine Fortune 500 companies (mostly telecommunications, energy and timber) and four major trade associations (bankers, insurers and small businesses) to defray the costs.
Washington fax machines, accustomed to spitting out ponderous statements on trade and telecommunications policy, are suddenly producing exclamation-point-filled notices of inaugural events to remember. One group, advertising yet another Elvis-look-alike at yet another party, even put an exclamation point after the word "fax!"
The faxes, of course, are not going up to Georgia Avenue.
"The inauguration's nice," said Elizabeth Neal, 69, who lives above Yong Mo Chong's liquor store, "Hamilton Beverages." "But the most important thing is what's going to happen afterwards. Because we've had a hard time."

HEADLINE: Cuomo's Schools Proposal Strikes a Chord

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposal to let counties finance schools with income rather than property taxes is a response to an outcry in many communities over property taxes that have continued to rise, sometimes sharply, even during the economic downturn.
"It points up the desperation single-family home owners feel because their property taxes just keep going up," Edwin L. Crawford, executive director of the New York State Association of Counties, said of Mr. Cuomo's proposal. 
 Many details of Mr. Cuomo's program remain sketchy and it is not clear how its impact would vary from taxpayer to taxpayer. But Mr. Cuomo contends his proposal would create a fairer system of school financing because he says income is better than property as a measure of wealth.
The problem of rising property taxes has fueled an emotional debate on Long Island, where officials say high taxes have squeezed elderly residents on fixed incomes and kept young families from buying homes. Concern about property taxes led to the formation of a commission two years ago to study tax relief.
 
'Political Dynamite'
 The New York State Temporary Commission for Tax Relief on Long Island, appointed by the county executives of Nassau and Suffolk counties and partly financed by the state, said that school costs were a major reason for rising property taxes.
In its final report, released late last year, the commission concluded that financing schools with income taxes would be more fair to the poor and middle class, and could stabilize or reduce property taxes.
According to a statistical analysis by the commission, Long Island residents earning over $100,000 per year would pay a larger share of school budgets if schools were financed through income taxes.
The idea had been discussed before, said John V. N. Klein, co-chairman of the commission, but no elected official had proposed it because it was considered "political dynamite."
"People viewed it as yet another tax in addition to existing taxes, and it was politically very treacherous to try to explain some of the nuances," said Mr. Klein, a lawyer in Mineola.
 
Squeeze on Taxpayers
 Mr. Cuomo's proposal, which was introduced in in his State of the State address on Wednesday, may have given the idea new life, Mr. Klein and other officials said.
Though Mr. Cuomo's aides said the Governor had not based his proposal on the Long Island study, they said the Governor did believe that Long Island needed property-tax relief.
"The reality is, property taxes are squeezing people and therefore it's led to this cry for a system that more reflects people's ability to pay," said Andrew J. Zambelli, Mr. Cuomo's chief of staff.
And though he provided only the sketchy outlines of a program, Mr. Cuomo has generated a statewide debate not only over property taxes, but also the financing of education, one of the thorniest subjects in state politics.
 
Unanswered Questions
 In his speech and in interviews afterward, Mr. Cuomo said that each county would be allowed to hold a referendum to determine whether voters would prefer the income-tax or the property-tax system.
If the county decided to switch to the income-tax system, taxes would be levied as a surcharge on the state income tax. The state would collect the money and return it to the county to be distributed among local school districts according to a formula.
But Mr. Cuomo left many details vague, some perhaps purposely for political reasons, some perhaps because his staff has yet to work them out. For instance, it is not clear who could call for a countywide referendum on the school-tax issue. Would it be county legislators, county executives or school boards?
More important, who would establish the formula that would determine how the revenue would be distributed among various school districts in a county? Would it be the state, the county or the school boards? Would those formulas be required to equalize the distribution of money between rich and poor districts?
And what about the 100 or so school districts that cross county lines?
Mr. Cuomo's aides said they intended to answer those questions after consulting with state legislators and local officials.
 
An Uphill Battle
 The answers will determine the type of opposition Mr. Cuomo's proposal will face. School boards, for instance, are likely to fight any plan that reduces their control over raising or spending taxes.
Even in its vague form, Mr. Cuomo's plan faces an uphill battle. The Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican from Nassau County, has said he would prefer that the income tax be raised statewide rather than county by county.
Many school administrators say that revenues from property taxes are more stable than income taxes and less likely to drop during a recession. And some have also questioned whether Mr. Cuomo's idea would indeed relieve the tax burden on the poor, the middle class and the elderly.

HEADLINE: 2 Economists See Recovery In New Jersey

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
The recession in New Jersey may be over, according to a new report by Rutgers University economists, but even using the most optimistic forecast of job growth, they say, it will be 1999 before employment returns to 1989 levels.
New Jersey lost jobs in every category but services and government employment from 1989 through 1992, the report found. Moreover, the slump eroded white-collar jobs in the usually robust wholesale and retail trades and in financial and real-estate services. Those job categories once seemed recession proof and in fact grew during the brief recession of 1981-82. 
 Getting back to 1989 levels by 1999 would require adding 50,000 jobs annually, which has been the average annual growth since World War II.
"This is a grim look back but it is not a grim look ahead," said Joseph J. Seneca, a professor of economics and vice present for academic affairs, who wrote the report with James W. Hughes, professor of public planning. It is part of a series of Rutgers reports on the state's economy.
 
Heady '80's 'Not Returning'
 "My caveat is that the recovery is going to be modest, and the heady times we saw in the mid-80's are not returning, which is perhaps all for the best," Professor Seneca said.
In Trenton today, the state's new director of economic recovery echoed that note of optimism, saying the economic situation was clearly not as bad as it has been.
Robert E. Hughey, named by Gov. Jim Florio last October to a one-year assignment as Chief of Economic Recovery, told a legislative committee that he expected growth in the state's economy "on the order of about 3 percent" over the next year, based on the predictions of economists.
"That's really very fast given where we have been for the past three years" Mr. Hughey said.
In the 1989-92 recession, the only nongovernment service jobs that showed strong growth were in health and social services.
The authors called the 1989-92 recession "a Texas-size debacle," because both Texas in the oil bust of the early 1980's and New Jersey in this recession lost 8.7 percent of their employment total, or about one job in 12.
That is not as bad as Massachusetts, the Rutgers report found. During roughly the same period as the New Jersey recession, Massachusetts lost 11.5 percent of its total employment, or one job out of nine. Connecticut fared about the same as Massachusetts, losing 11.7 percent of its total employment during the recession. Similar figures of New York State were not yet available.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Fall to a 44-Month Low

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
First-time claims for state unemployment insurance tumbled during Christmas week to the lowest level in more than three years, the Labor Department said today.
The unexpected decrease of 40,000 claims, to a seasonally adjusted 291,000 in the week ended Dec. 26, followed a revised drop of 29,000, to 331,000, a week earlier. The previous week's report initially showed a decline of 28,000, to 332,000. 
 The latest weekly level of claims was the lowest since April 22, 1989, when it was also 291,000, a Labor Department spokeswoman said.
Economists generally view the volatile weekly number with some skepticism, however, preferring the four-week moving average. But that average decreased by 8,500 claims, to 332,500, the lowest since September 1989.
"Christmas might have thrown some static, but these numbers have been improving week after week," said Mike Dancey, a trader at the Brokers Resource Corporation in Chicago. "Things are improving."
Although the numbers signal that layoffs continue to taper off as the economy gains strength, a workweek shortened by the Christmas holiday also contributed to the decrease in claims, the government statistics showed.
"If we wash all this through the machinery, I'd say we'd come out with a 5,000 decline in real terms," said Marco Babic, an economist at Evans Economics in Washington. "I think most of it is holiday related."
Twenty-nine states and territories reported decreases in jobless claims in the latest reporting week, led by California and North Carolina. Twenty-four reported increases, led by Wisconsin and Puerto Rico.
The Labor Department also said the number of people receiving benefits in the week ended Dec. 19 decreased 20,000, to 2.75 million, the lowest since October 1990.
The Labor Department also said that 27,430 workers in 50 states and territories filed emergency claims under a separate program providing extended jobless benefits.

Free Agents and the Ratings Pie

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
Is free agency in the National Football League NBC's hope for a brighter future? Will an influx of big-name National Conference players to the American Conference tilt the ratings balance from historically dominant CBS to NBC?
It has been 17 seasons since NBC, the A.F.C. network, earned higher Nielsen ratings than CBS, the N.F.C. network. Back in 1975, NBC won the ratings game, 14.2-14.0, after winning, 14.0-13.7, in 1974. Those were the network's only victories. 
 Ever since, the closest NBC has come to CBS was losing, 15.3-15.0, in 1980. (In those days, each rating point represented 685,000 television households. Today, each rating point equals 931,000 TV households.)
Most of CBS's historic ratings dominance has to do with geographic market size. The N.F.C. has teams in larger markets, which help CBS's ratings even when the cities' teams are not Super Bowl contenders.
The N.F.C. has the only teams in Chicago, San Francisco, Washington, Philadelphia and Dallas, plus the only recently competitive team in New York. There is no offsetting balm for NBC in knowing that the A.F.C.'s strength lies in markets with playoff teams like Buffalo, Miami and Pittsburgh.
And when it loses important A.F.C. games such as Buffalo-Houston to ESPN, as it did on the final Sunday night of the season, the peacock network could just plotz.
"In the 1970's at CBS, we used to dream about the days when the Bears, Eagles, Giants and Redskins would all be good at the same time," said Kevin O'Malley, a former CBS official who is now senior vice president of Turner Sports.
The best potential news for NBC came Wednesday when the league and the players agreed on a seven-year labor agreement that gives veteran players true free agency. From March 1 to July 15, more than 250 players -- except for those designated as "franchise players" -- will be eligible to negotiate with any team.
Imagine if the bulk of the elite N.F.C. free agents defected to A.F.C. teams (and A.F.C. teams suffered a lesser corresponding talent drain) bringing in players like Eagles defensive end Reggie White, Packers wide receiver Sterling Sharpe, Giants linebacker Carl Banks, Redskins receivers Art Monk and Gary Clark and Redskins linebacker Wilber Marshall.
"What a wonderful prospect," said Terry O'Neil, executive producer of NBC Sports.
Would such an interconference migration narrow the ratings chasm between CBS and NBC, which finished the regular season at 13.0-11.2? Would watching Reggie White in Jets green or Carl Banks in the Browns' Dog Pound make a difference?
O'Neil isn't certain. The relatively greater success of NBC in the 1970's, he said, was attributed more to the overall appeal of the Steelers, Dolphins and Raiders, not individual player allure.
Any marquee-player movement that favored the A.F.C. would have to be one element in conference-wide improvement that would chip away, not overcome, the N.F.C.'s natural advantage in market size.
"We're waiting for the cycle to reverse, but you need to see it reverse itself on the field," said O'Neil. "One player doesn't make that big a difference."
Until any infusion of N.F.C. talent resuscitates A.F.C. ratings on NBC, O'Neil is content to nurture his network's underdog status and wait for days when strong N.F.C. teams play A.F.C. teams. (NBC televises the games when the visiting team is from the A.F.C.)
"We get to use their strength against them," he said.
The significance of any N.F.C.-to-A.F.C. power shift may pale in importance with the anticipated leap in the cost of signing free agents. That uptick will come at a time when CBS, NBC, ABC, TNT and ESPN, already losing money on their $3.6 billion worth of contracts, want to pay less when the deals expire after next season.
N.F.L. owners made their financial situation less certain last year by rejecting a plan to slash 1993 rights fees by about $238 million and extend the deals at that level through 1995. Instead, the owners decided on a $28 million rollback in 1993 and to roll the dice on an improving economy.
But labor talks put off TV talks. "We haven't visited with the networks for three months," said the Cleveland Browns' owner, Art Modell, a key proponent of the rollback. "We have a new configuration of costs that we have to discuss among ourselves before we go to the networks."
It is possible, a person close to the situation who asked not to be named said, for owners to revisit the $28 million reduction for next year.
Ross Greenburg, the executive producer of HBO Sports, said: "The networks are the banks for the league and their revenues dictate what the owners have to spend. If one owner pays a player $5 million a year, it puts the whole system out of whack. I don't think TV money can support those kinds of salaries. They're all losing money now, without free agency."
Of course, Greenburg wants HBO to join the N.F.L.'s TV/banking fraternity, saying: "I'd hope we're looked on as a legitimate player, to help make up for the network shortfall."

Mass Moca, Round 2
The Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art has been given another chance. Last week, Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts agreed to give the museum's Cultural Development Commission a six-month extension to raise $12 million. If it can come up with the money, the Governor said, he will release the $33 million approved by the State Legislature in 1988 to establish the museum in North Adams, Mass. Governor Weld temporarily froze the money after he took office in 1991.
So far, the commission has secured pledges of $4.1 million from individuals, corporations and foundations. The project, popularly known as Mass Moca, is billed as the world's largest museum of contemporary art, concentrating on works from the 1960's, 70's and 80's. The ambitious goal is to fill the abandoned Sprague Technologies plant in North Adams, a complex of 28 buildings on 13.5 acres. 
 "The Governor feels the commission should be able to have more time for fund-raising," said Ann Murphy, a spokeswoman for Mr. Weld. "This fall he visited the site, and although he realizes the potential economic stimulus it could provide to the Berkshires, he believes this has to be a joint public-private venture. Now the private sector has to come up with its end of the bargain."
Former Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis supported the project, authorizing almost $2 million for the master plan. Designed by a team of architects headed by Frank Gehry of Los Angeles, Robert Venturi of Philadelphia and David Childs of Skidmore Owings & Merrill in New York City, the 400,000-square-foot complex would include galleries, a cafe, art-related offices, a hotel and retail space. The commission estimates that the project would cost $70 million, attract 130,000 to 150,000 visitors a year, and provide employment and tourist income for North Adams, an economically depressed city of 17,000.
 
Wanted: A Partner
 "When the Governor took office, he asked the executive planning group of the Mass Moca Commission for three things before he would release the money," said Gary Schiff, the project manager. "The first was the $12 million in private funds; the second, to secure the building permits needed to proceed with the renovations, and the third, to hire an operator, a partner like the Guggenheim Museum, that would bring art to the table."
Mr. Schiff said the commission has obtained the local permits. It has also received statements of interest from three institutions that could run Mass Moca: the Guggenheim in Manhattan, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Art Gallery of Ontario.
Mr. Schiff said the commission's first choice would be the Guggenheim, an obvious partner because Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim's director, was chairman of the original planning group for Mass Moca in 1985. In those days, Mr. Krens was the director of the Williams College Art Museum in nearby Williamstown, Mass.
A collaboration is also in keeping with the Guggenheim's ambitious plans to run satellite institutions that would use its permanent collection. "Like the Governor, we're watching the state of the economy and the amount of commitment to the project," said Michael Govan, the Guggenheim's deputy director. "We believe that Mass Moca is a valid concept that no museum provides: to properly exhibit the work of the last three decades."
Mr. Govan said the Guggenheim would seriously consider running Mass Moca if the proper resources were found. At this point, however, nothing is definite. The commission is to meet with Governor Weld on July 31 to review the project's progress. "It doesn't make sense to squash this now," Mr. Schiff said. "Not when it's gone this far."
 
Evening Viewings
 About 10 years ago, downtown department stores in various cities began staying open later to attract working customers and compete with shopping malls. Then museums began extending their hours to accommodate young professionals. So perhaps it should come as no surprise that a retail-minded auction house like Sotheby's would be next.
Sotheby's in New York is now offering viewing until 8 P.M. before certain sales. To make the event even more appealing, it will serve wine. The first late evening is scheduled for Monday, when the Old Master paintings and drawings go on view before sales on Wednesday and next Friday.
It would be logical to assume that this was an idea from Sotheby's chairman, the shopping-center magnate A. Alfred Taubman. But Diana D. Brooks, president and chief operating officer of Sotheby's, said the Old Masters department thought up the scheme. Inside every Old Masters sale catalogue is an elegant blue-trimmed card, inviting clients to the evening viewing.
"We're planning to try these later viewing hours for a number of departments and see how they work," Mrs. Brooks said. "The whole point is to try to be more accessible." She added that Sotheby's had many catalogue subscribers its staff didn't know personally and that the invitations were enclosed in the catalogues in the hopes of enticing them into the auction house.
Sotheby's has also been experimenting with Sunday sales. The first was held on Oct. 25, when Sotheby's auctioned American furniture, folk art and paintings in Manhattan. "We're doing another Sunday sale this month, too," Mrs. Brooks said, citing the Jan. 31 sale of American furniture in Manhattan.
Does Christie's plan to follow its rival? "Not at this point," a spokeswoman said.
Bets are, however, that it, too, will start burning the candle at both ends.
 
Freud and Acquavella
 The 70-year-old English realist painter Lucian Freud has switched galleries, leaving James Kirkman of London, who had been Mr. Freud's dealer for 20 years, for the William Acquavella Gallery in New York. It is an unusual choice, since the gallery does not usually represent living artists.
"He's the only artist I've taken on," said William Acquavella, the owner of the Manhattan gallery. "I've really never represented anyone, except years ago when I briefly took on some younger artists. But I like Freud as a painter, so I've committed to him. But he'll probably be the only one."
While Mr. Acquavella declined to discuss the details of the arrangement, he did confirm that he had purchased a large body of work from Mr. Freud's studio. "Right now he's working on large-scale pieces, which I think are the best he's ever done," Mr. Acquavella said. The gallery already has three.
Mr. Acquavella's timing is certainly right. A traveling exhibition of paintings, drawings and etchings done since 1980 is to open at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London in September, then travel to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in December and to the Reina Sofia in Madrid in 1994.

Restraint and Ebullience In Cuban and Colleagues

BYLINE: BY ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
"Wifredo Lam and His Contemporaries, 1938-1952" is like a play whose two acts couldn't be more different. The first is slow and quiet, the second fast and loud; but together they form a dense, thought-provoking unit.
Downstairs at the Studio Museum in Harlem, restraint rules. Proceeding at an almost stately pace, the show focuses on the unfolding of Wifredo Lam's moody but gentlemanly art in the years just before, during and after World War II. Lam, who was born in Cuba of a Chinese father and a mulatto mother, went to Spain to study art in 1923, when he was 21, and to Paris in 1938, where he was befriended by Picasso and Andre Breton. He spent most of the years covered by this exhibition back in Cuba, driven there by the war in 1941, and during this time he integrated Cubist and Surrealist innovations with symbols and motifs of his own Afro-Cuban culture. 
 The works on display -- the best of which are on paper and date from the first half of the 1940's -- are often pale and light of touch. They feature Picassoid figures whose violently rearranged bodies and faces blend aspects of horse and human with hints of mysterious rites and rituals. Although Lam did not visit New York until 1948, he had one-man shows at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in 1942, '44 and '45. His efforts from these years are very much in step with, if not a little in advance of, the totemic images and mythical subjects of a number of North American artists whose style would soon be called Abstract Expressionist.
The high point here is the verdant blue-green "Jungle" from 1943, an enormous crowded painting on paper that groups five of Lam's hybrid beings against dense tropical foliage. Its proudly glaring figures look back to Picasso's "Demoiselles d'Avignon," while its shallow space and tightly rhythmic composition seem to presage Pollock's all-over drip paintings.
Upstairs, Lam's friends, acquaintances and contemporaries from Europe, the United States and Cuba hold forth. Here, the scene is charged, at times ebullient and almost raucously diverse, as an array of sensibilities both legendary and nearly unknown, respond to different strains of European modernism. Various Abstract Expressionists are on hand, including Pollock, Adolph Gottlieb, Robert Motherwell and Richard Pousette-Dart, as are Europe-based painters like Matta and Andre Masson, who waited out the war in the United States, and Victor Brauner and Oscar Dominguez, a Spanish Surrealist. Many of them are represented by fascinating paintings not often seen in New York.
The expressionist figuration of the Cobra group, which was formed in Belgium in 1948, and which shared Lam's belief in national styles, is briefly glimpsed in small paintings and watercolors by Asger Jorn, Constant and Karl Appel. And more than half the upstairs space here is devoted to the work of Lam's Cuban contemporaries, who abandoned academic training (often with the help of travel to Paris) for Cubism and Surrealism, sometimes adding heavy flavorings of folk art.
This section, which is spotty but in some ways the liveliest part of the show, is full of relatively unknown names and unfamiliar paintings. (Many of them belong to the Museum of Modern Art, which actively collected Latin American art in the 1940's and 50's.) Especially noteworthy are the bright, brashly confident Cubist works of Amelia Pelaez del Casals; "The Tornado," by Mario Carreno, which has a suave, faux-naivete similar to that of Raoul Dufy's work; "The Giadrunama and the Bird," by Luis Martinez-Pedro, an artist of dazzling graphic skills, and Rene Portocarrero's "Cerro Interior," which translates stained glass and tiled floors into a vibrant visual mosaic.
This is the second big Lam exhibition of the season, and it is better than the first, a retrospective of the artist's works on paper at the Americas Society in Manhattan last fall. In the earlier show, Lam's often wan images seemed overshadowed by inflationary wall texts. These touted him as a "decolonizer" who transcended and disrupted European modernism by infusing his art with a more authentic primitivism derived from his own cultural roots. But the visual evidence spoke of his debt to a range of artists, from Picasso to Matta.
The Studio Museum show takes a different tack, assembling stronger works and also removing Lam's art from the vacuum of theory. Specializing in wall texts that concentrate on identifying the Afro-Cuban sources of some of Lam's motifs, it demonstrates that the return to Cuba precipitated Lam's most original work. In addition, it simply places Lam's work in the diverse company of the art of his time, allowing viewers to compare and contrast and draw their own conclusions.
The chance to compare Lam's work with that of his Abstract Expressionist and Cuban contemporaries, in particular, sharpens one's appreciation of his achievement and his personality. Although his early 40's works seem especially prescient, in the second half of the decade, when Abstract Expressionism came into its own, Lam's art fell more heavily than ever under the spell of Picasso, in particular the tortured animal-human forms of "Guernica." The oddly arid, attenuated images from these years, which, tellingly, are on canvas not paper, forsake the lush plant forms of the Cuban landscape that inspired the artist when he first returned to his homeland. They seem adrift, as if the end of the war had refocused Lam's attention on Europe. In fact, he returned to Paris to live in 1952, dying there is 1982.
Compared to his Cuban contemporaries, Lam seems extraordinarily ambitious, determined to achieve an art of international stature. But he also comes across as inhibited, as if constricted or weighed down by this ambition, or by some intrinsic personality trait. Apart from a few images -- most notably "The Jungle," his small drawings and a tiny softly colored painting from 1948 titled "I Am Leaving" -- Lam seemed to keep all the different cultures he moved through at arm's length. His work is dignified and aloof, entirely consistent with the way this tall, rather priestly artist himself appears in photographs. But in the end it is also more admirable than satisfying, which is why you may find yourself enjoying this exhibition's second act a bit more than its first.
"Wifredo Lam and His Contemporaries, 1938-1952" remains at the Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, through April 11.

HEADLINE: The First, Faltering Steps Toward A Free Market

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
"Russia for Sale: The Rough Road to Capitalism" covers two turbulent years of Russia's staggerings toward a market economy, from 1990, when aspiring entrepreneurs were running into entrenched obstructionists, through the attempted coup by hard-liners in August 1991, up to the shaky ascendance of President Boris N. Yeltsin.
Sasha, a St. Petersburg steelworker and the central figure of a timely documentary on Sunday, is an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Yeltsin. You can see him at work at two jobs and then giving blood to earn a few more rubles, at home in the unspacious but subsidized apartment where he lives with his wife and two sons, and on long lines with other shoppers. Sasha tells of his disillusionment with Communist Party promises -- "We've simply been cheated" -- and his faith in the democratic movement, with its goal of a free market. 
 The theme of the evening is the clash between the Yeltsin-style innovators and the party bosses who still run things. One wishful businessman focused on here, Volodya, spent nine months in prison for his efforts to become a capitalist. Whether he actually violated the law is not clear, in part because the laws, made for a wholly state-controlled economic system, are themselves far from clear when it comes to dealing with anything resembling an unfettered economy.
Many Russians, still faced with bare shelves in Government stores and out-of-reach prices in private markets, are not entranced by the new businessmen, whom they dismiss as shady operators with little concern for the general well-being. But prospects of profit seem to be dancing in many heads. By the end of this pro-Yeltsin hour, the police officer who arrested Volodya has set up his own private security business, staffed with those, like himself, who learned their job by cracking down on the emerging Volodyas and Sashas.
'Elvis, U.S.A.'
 TBS, tonight at 8:05
Tonight you can join Paul Provenza, a low-key comedian who looks a little like Robert De Niro, on an intermittently droll journey around the United States in a 1956 Cadillac convertible in search of the spirit of Elvis Presley. He finds it in forms like the Elvis Potato (Mr. Provenza is not able to attract much interest in a pumpkin that he says looks like Ed Asner); a piece of a carpet that Elvis may have stood on ("On, boy," Mr. Provenza says, "if only those stains could talk"); a roll of toilet paper said to have been stolen from Graceland, Elvis's home in Memphis, and other intimate artifacts like a wart that may once have been attached to Elvis and a promising toenail.
Mr. Provenza's bemused view of the phenomenon seems rational in the circumstances. He asks one of the innumerable Elvis imitators he encounters, "Why do you think this never happened to Robert Goulet?"
'Pole to Pole'
 A&E, Sunday at 8 P.M
On the subjects of journeys and Russia, the former Soviet Union is the destination in the opening hour of Michael Palin's eight-hour account of his travels from the North Pole to the South Pole without the help of the scheduled airlines. You can follow the good-humored, enthusiastic British actor and writer, last seen on A&E in "Around the World in 80 Days," from the top of the world down through Scandinavia by small plane, motorized sledge, icebreaker, fishing trawler, speedboat and other means of locomotion.
En route he discusses vegetarianism with a trapper in the middle of a snowy nowhere, swings from one ship to another on a hook, pans for gold, chats with Santa Claus and goes skinny-dipping after enduring an authentic Finnish sauna. The second hour, also on Sunday, at 9, finds him hastening to catch a ferry to Turkey. Next week he goes on to Egypt, and most of the rest of his journey will be through Africa. It's a vigorous and colorful trip, and Mr. Palin makes agreeable company if you can keep up with him.

The trial, which received considerable attention, including gavel-to-gavel coverage by Court TV, in September, led to a shift in legal assumptions about the rights and duties of parents and children.

Rangers' Plight Falls On Captain Dad Now

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
Captain Dad knows best. He is stern but merry, kindly and brave, leads by example playing hard and hurt; you would follow him through fire on ice because he's always right or, even better, because he relieves you of the responsibility to think for yourself.
But when Captain Dad fails to deliver, he takes all the blame; his shame is worse than his honor. 
 There have been two games since Mark Messier, the Rangers' captain, became Dad on Monday. The tie with the New Jersey Devils, a good team struggling, and the rout of the Ottawa Senators, a poor team dying, offered no sure clues to the outcome of Messier's gamble: in its twilight, he has put the image of his career on the line.
It was no compulsive gesture; the scenario and his personality dictated it. He had been brought to New York as the frozen chosen, a man with four Stanley Cup rings who knew how to win. He skated like a winner, chilly-eyed, confident; off the ice, the cant of his body and the controlled tension of his voice were reminiscent of generals' at press briefings.
The struggle for control of the team between Messier and Coach Roger Neilson did not become critical until the Rangers collapsed in the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Even a winning hockey team is not really the family you wish you had, but a losing team or a team that has lost its way is a nightmare family from hell, a jittery jumble of blamethrowers.
There's blame enough for all. Neilson, reserved, cerebral, was a stereotypical football coach -- videotape-head, chess-player, control freak -- for a team that needed a basketball coach -- a creative consultant, a manipulative salesperson who made each player feel significant and stretched. Neilson was sure to have problems with Messier, an aging, battered warrior-prince who had played in the shadow of the Great Gretzky and wanted to be the hero of a team of his own.
And Messier, for all his superstar aura -- typically, Eric Lindros as a junior player made his locker a grotto of Messier photos -- did not necessarily feed the potential of others. He centered a line that included his personal bodyguard, Adam Graves, and an emerging marksman, Tony Amonte, and because of his infirmities rarely pulled his weight on defense.
There are players on the Rangers, Brian Leetch, Mike Gartner, James Patrick, now the Russians, who in their ways are as interesting performers as Messier. They have done well, but perhaps not flowered as much as they might under a system that made Messier the hub of the wheel. He is, after all, the essential Canadian hard-core gunner (Gordie Howe was another), cold, mean, efficient, constantly hooking, pushing tripping, brilliantly alert to opportunity.
But it is Messier as team leader, party host, moral beacon, big brother, that makes the muckers and grinders moist. Perhaps more than any other major sports team members, hockey players revel in their brotherhood of hard men -- like hunters and firefighters and soldiers on the line -- whose talk of macho and single-minded discipline often borders on authoritarianism.
That traditional hockey esthetic may be changing now as the game seems poised to follow the National Basketball Association into a new world of marketing, expansion, internationalism, television. The waves of gifted, flashy American, Russian and European players are making the game more exciting and accessible to people who didn't skate to school. The new franchises representing Blockbuster Video and Disney World may vote differently from the old boy Canadians.
Paramount's current desperation for a winning Ranger team is not a response to their ever-loyal fans but to the coming new order in hockey. New York teams can no longer assume they will be their leagues' flagship franchises. There are too many truly major league cities in North America now. The Rangers cannot afford to be a failure when it's morning in The Rink.
Even though Messier represents the old order, it made far more immediate strategic, economic and public-relations sense to dump Neilson; after all, Madonna had never considered Roger a boy-toy. But the fans are waiting to be shown; they booed Messier at the Garden the other night.
Maybe the booing was just a casual sympathy vote for Neilson, who was heading home to Canada with his best friend, the cancer-riddled 14-year-old Labrador, Mike. Roger wanted to get home before Mike died, so he could be put down and buried in his native soil.
Or maybe the booing was really for Mess, a man clutching and grabbing at his time, a man who doesn't hit people much anymore, and when he does they don't always notice.
The rest of the season will be Messier's failure or triumph. In 10 days, Messier will turn 32, old for a hockey player, not necessarily old for the lead in the continuing Ranger sitcom, which will be called either Captain Dad or Father Knew Worst.

This Year at Javits Center, Industry Stages Variety Show

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD

 BODY:
It is considered a marine trade exhibition, but the New York National Boat Show this year is offering enough sideshows to fill a circus tent.
The event, in its 83d year, is scheduled to open officially tomorrow at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, at 11th Avenue between 34th and 39th Streets. It is open for a sneak preview today for anyone willing to pay $20 for a ticket, compared with the regular $8 admission price for an adult. 
 With as many as 1,000 recreational boats filling an area the size of six football fields, the show, designed as a kind of marketing barometer on anticipated sales for the upcoming boating season, has plenty of browsing potential. But added to the marine lineup, which includes thousands of boating accessories, will be many other exhibits designed to educate and entertain showgoers.
For instance, there will be an indoor pond, measuring 25 feet by 50 feet, for radio-controlled model boats, which visitors will be able to operate. Several world-class fishing experts will offer seminars on fresh-water and saltwater techniques. And instructors will conduct a water-ski clinic. An exhibit of antique boats will include a 1939 hydroplane once raced by Guy Lombardo.
Ninety percent of the new boats on display will be powerboats. While the New York show usually emphasizes power rather than sail, the concentration this year is heavier than usual. Many sailboat manufacturers have chosen to show their wares instead at Sail Expo, a new exhibition scheduled for Feb. 4-7 in Atlantic City.
In an effort to woo sailing enthusiasts to the New York show, organizers have set up Sail Pier 34, an indoor floor area where sailboats will be tied up at a waterfront dock.
The boating industry has been hit hard by the recession. Since 1988, the last lucrative year in the marine industry, when sales totaled $18 billion, sales have declined by 45 percent. Nevertheless, people in the marine industry appear to be taking a more optimistic view this year.
"With the economy coming back, I'm looking for increased attendance at the show," said Michael Duffy, the New York show's manager. He noted that ticket sales in recent years, which he declined to reveal, have been off as much as 20 percent from the boom years of the late 1980's.
Exhibit space at the New York show, which extends through Sunday, Jan. 17, is sold out this year, Duffy said.
For information on the show, telephone (212) 216-3616.

Reich Charts a Path to Return the Labor Dept. to Center Stage

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN

 BODY:

Federico F. Pena
Secretary of Transportation
WASHINGTON (Special to The New York Times) -- Federico F. Pena, the Transportation Secretary-designate, put himself at odds with budget cutters in the Clinton Administration when he said that money now used to keep the deficit down should be spent on public works. 
 Mr. Pena told the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation that the Aviation Trust Fund, which is financed by a tax on airline tickets, has a $7.5 billion surplus and said the money should be used to build and renovate airports and to modernize air traffic-control systems. That is the original purpose of the trust fund, but for more than a decade its surpluses have gone unspent to avoid increasing the deficit. Mr. Clinton's top budget officials have repeatedly described budget reduction as their top priority.
Anticipating Mr. Pena's battles with Mr. Clinton's budget cutters, Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat who is chairman of the committee, told Mr. Pena to leave immediately for Little Rock. "They're picking your pockets right now," Mr. Hollings said.
Mr. Hollings predicted that his committee would approve Mr. Pena's nomination next week and send it to the floor for swift approval.
Mr. Pena described his goal as a public-private "partnership." Jim Landry, president of the Air Transport Association, which represents the airline industry, said that although he welcomed this approach, "U.S. airlines also need some immediate tax and regulatory relief that must be addressed if we are to put a stop to the layoff notices for airline employees."
Mr. Pena said that re-regulation of the airline industry was "not on my radar." He endorsed a proposal by Stephen M. Wolf, chairman of United Air Lines, who on Wednesday called for a national commission to study the beleaguered airline industry, which has lost $8 billion since 1990. United announced on Wednesday that it would eliminate 2,800 jobs in an economy effort.
"We need to bring the best minds that we can to look at this, and come up with some solution," Mr. Pena said.
On other issues, Mr. Pena endorsed tougher fuel-economy standards, high-speed trains and the use of public pension funds to build and modernize parts of the transportation system. "If you structure a program carefully, so that it's a sound investment, I think there's a way to make that work," he said.

At Wits' End: Algonquinites in Hollywood

BYLINE: By CARYN JAMES

 BODY:
BY 1935, Dorothy Parker had abandoned the life of a New York sophisticate for that of a Hollywood screenwriter, but the sunshine did nothing to mellow her caustic outlook. As she wrote in a letter back east to Alexander Woollcott, her friend from the old days of the Algonquin Round Table, "Aside from the work which I hate like holy water, I love it here." It was the kindest thing she ever said about writing for the movies.
About the same time, George S. Kaufman, the quintessential Broadway playwright, wrote to a friend, "I'm going to Hollywood, God damn it, this Saturday, but only for a few weeks." He was true to his word, which went a long way toward saving his self-respect. 
 For while Parker, Kaufman, Woollcott and Robert Benchley -- the core group of writers who gathered daily for lunch at the Algonquin Hotel in the 1920's -- were not big on matters of faith, there were a few things they deeply believed in: wit, fame and the fundamental truth expressed in a telegram from their pal Herman Mankiewicz. Soon after arriving in Hollywood as a screenwriter, Mankiewicz cabled Ben Hecht: "There are millions to be grabbed out here and your only competition is idiots. Don't let this get around."
The Algonquinites hated Hollywood, but that doesn't mean they weren't good at it. The proof is in "Tales of the Algonquin Round Table," a deliciously entertaining, extravagant series running at the Film Forum in the South Village from today through Feb. 18. The series includes about 50 features connected (sometimes in a glancing way) to the Algonquinites: great Hollywood valentines like "Dinner at Eight"; arty eccentricities like "The Scoundrel," with Noel Coward as the supercilious title character; the early screwball comedy "Laughter," and several programs of classic Benchley shorts, comic lectures like "How to Sleep" and "The Sex Life of the Polyp." All demonstrate that the Algonquin writers contributed richly to the movies in spite of themselves.
"The Ten-Year Lunch," Aviva Slesin's 1987 documentary (shown at matinees this weekend), offers a vivid introduction to the pre-Hollywood Round Table. They were journalists when they started out: Woollcott, the most influential drama critic of his day; Kaufman, the drama editor of The New York Times; Robert Sherwood, a film critic whose work pre-dated talkies; Benchley and Parker and Donald Ogden Stewart, essayists and critics for various magazines. They ate together, worked together and, most important, quoted each other's remarks in print, and so became famous for being famously witty.
In "The Ten-Year Lunch," you can find the Round Table's best and best-known lines. Playing one of the word games the group loved, Parker was asked to use "horticulture" in a sentence and said, "You can lead a whore to culture but you can't make her think."
By 1929, the Round Table had disbanded, partly because so many had become successful on Broadway or, more frequently, in Hollywood.
Some, like Kaufman, took the movie money and ran. Though he worked on some film scripts -- notably, "A Night at the Opera," having co-written "The Cocoanuts" and "Animal Crackers" for the Marx Brothers on Broadway -- most of Kaufman's contributions to Hollywood came from the constant stream of hit plays he co-wrote, then surrendered to Hollywood studios and writers.
Several films based on his plays -- "Dinner at Eight," "The Royal Family of Broadway," "The Man Who Came to Dinner" -- are social satires that cozy up to the rich, only to discover that they are as wonderfully foolish as poor folk. (That, basically, is what the Algonquinites did in life, too.) But there is a refreshing current of cynicism in everything Kaufman touched. It was he, after all, who suggested that Irving Berlin change the line "I'll be loving you always" to "I'll be loving you Thursday."
"The Man Who Came to Dinner" (to be shown this weekend) was written by Kaufman and Moss Hart because they had promised Woollcott a play for him to star in. They created Sheriden Whiteside, a Woollcott clone and self-important curmudgeon, who breaks a hip while on a lecture tour and takes over the house and lives of his nouveau riche host. As it happened, on stage and screen Monty Wooley played Whiteside with a great deal more heart than the insufferable Woollcott might have.
At least that's the conclusion to be drawn from seeing Woollcott on screen in the 1934 short "Mr. W.'s Little Game" (on a later program with "The Man With Two Faces," based on a Kaufman-Woollcott play). It isn't much of a film, but it is a fascinating biographical footnote. Playing himself, Woollcott sits in a restaurant and instigates a word game that he is certain, with his superior intellect, to win. His competitor is a blonde he calls Little Miss Birdbrain. Whatever charms Woollcott had in life -- and he was said to be generous as well as insulting and vicious -- they fail to come through on screen. His writing seems dated and shallow today, and the petty personality behind "Mr. W.'s Little Game" suggests why.
Woollcott usually stayed far away from the movies, but Hollywood has its revenge on the cautious Kaufman. When the actress Mary Astor was embroiled in an ugly custody suit, her ex-husband leaked parts of her diary to the press. There in print was the evidence of her love affair with Kaufman, including the detail that she considered him a "perfect" lover. Kaufman was in Hollywood when he was summoned to court in the case, but he escaped by hiding out in Moss Hart's house, then on Irving Thalberg's yacht, and then by sneaking onto a train back East, still on the lam.
The Astor diary was a tabloid scandal for weeks, and Kaufman was mortified. So you have to wonder why the only film Kaufman ever directed, a dozen years later, was a comedy about tabloids competing to get their hands on a scandalous diary. In "The Senator Was Indiscreet" (1947), William Powell plays a genially corrupt Senator. "There's an old saying in my state," the Senator says. "If you can't beat 'em, bribe 'em." When he misplaces the dairy that recorded those bribes, tabloids scramble to find it, much the way they competed to publish the Astor diaries. Kaufman directs this without a wink at the audience.
As a film, "The Senator Was Indiscreet" is stiffly theatrical, with conspicuous painted backdrops. But as a satire (written by Charles MacArthur), it seems fresher than ever. Note the Senator's campaign banner that says: "Against inflation. Against deflation. For flation."
Kaufman obviously forgave Hollywood. Other Algonquinites like Parker and Benchley hated themselves for selling out their talent, and basically drank themselves to death.
Parker, who usually worked on scripts with her on-and-off husband, Alan Campbell, contributed little to movies that can be attributed to her with any certainty. Parker and Campbell wrote the screenplay for the 1937 version of "A Star Is Born," still a scathing look at Hollywood's destructive shallowness. But much of her work was additional dialogue and script doctoring. Much of the time, she wasn't sober. There is a story of Parker in Hollywood, weeping into her drink, "I used to be a poet."
Benchley was just as tortured. All his life he intended to write a historical book about Queen Anne, meaning to become a "serious" writer. He never knew that his contribution to the movies would remain enduring and wildly comic.
The dozens of shorts he began making in 1928 are parodies of lectures, with the ever-inept Benchley character explaining some banal experience. His discussion of "How to Start the Day" or "How to Behave" (when you're a houseguest, it doesn't pay to sleep till noon) are examples of deadpan wit at its best. In "Important Business," Benchley plays a businessman who tells his family and colleagues he is going to Washington on top-secret business. He actually goes to Washington, though he never gets beyond the train station. Self-importance was never so genially or sympathetically mocked.
The immense range and wealth of the Film Forum series comes with a catch: a broad definition of what the Round Table was, extending the group's reach to include peripheral members like Mankiewicz, Hecht and MacArthur. But Bruce Goldstein, the Film Forum's repertory programmer, has created this series with his usual savvy sense. His generous definition reveals that the wry, sophisticated Algonquin spirit was often best expressed on film by artists who were not charter members of the Round Table.
Hecht and MacArthur and Mankiewicz contributed far more to the movies than any of the true Algonquinites. Not coincidentally (and despite Mankiewicz's telegram), they were not so snobbishly hostile to Hollywood. Their lesser-known films offer some of the best surprises in this series.
Mankiewicz's script for "Ladies' Man" (1931), with William Powell as an unabashed gigolo involved with Carole Lombard and her mother, is a sharp, uncompromising period piece. The audience has no misconceptions about why the wealthy older woman allows Powell to sell her jewels and keep the cash. As in many films of the day, there is too much melodrama here; someone is always threatening suicide or pulling a gun to resolve romantic differences. But Mankiewicz's steely dialogue remains effective.
"If you're not going to marry me, I'll kill myself," Lombard tells Powell. "Are you going to marry me?"
Calmly, urbanely, Powell answers, "I don't think so."
Two little-known Hecht-MacArthur films are the most intriguing and cinematic in the series. In the mid-1930's, the team wrote, produced and directed several films, including "Crime Without Passion," in which Claude Rains plays a caddish lawyer who thinks he commits a murder out of jealousy. The film's editor, Slavko Vorkapitch, created a spectacular, surreal opening montage in which women representing the Furies fly up against New York skyscrapers while shattering glass falls around them. Later, as Rains tries to cover up his crime, he walks the streets mentally talking to himself in voice-over. There is an affection for the camera and the possibilities of film here that the true Algonquinites never possessed.
And the 1936 Hecht-MacArthur film, "The Scoundrel," may exemplify the Algonquin spirit best of all. Noel Coward, as a heartless, womanizing book publisher named Anthony Mallare, is the soul of cynical sophistication. Stepping out of the shower next to his office, Mallare tells his colleagues why he will not publish a sure best-seller. "It reeks of morality," he says contemptuously. "It's a vulgar way to swindle the public, selling them the things they least need -- virtue and dullness."
Mallare comes to reject -- through a laughable return from the dead -- his own cold-hearted life. "The Scoundrel" ends bizarrely, as if "It's a Wonderful Life" were grafted onto an Oscar Wilde play. But until then, it offers glimpses of the Algonquin Round Table at its worst and best. The worst is personified by Alexander Woollcott in a cameo role. As an author-friend of Mallare, Woollcott suggests all the chic, empty cynicism of his set.
But you can say this for the multi-talented Algonquinites: They were never virtuous and never dull. They might have taken that as a great compliment.

Who's Who at the Round Table
 Not every member (regular or occasional) of the Algonquin Round Table went to Hollywood. But here is a glimpse of those who did and are included in the Film Forum series:
ROBERT BENCHLEY: A humorist, critic and magazine writer. Benchley left New York behind for a lucrative career, starring in an immensely popular series of movie shorts. "How to Sleep" (1935) won an Academy Award.
MARC CONNELLY: A theater reporter turned playwright. Connelly was a true Algonquinite and George S. Kaufman's earliest collaborator.
EDNA FERBER: A Round Table regular. Ferber was one of Kaufman's best collaborators ("The Royal Family," "Dinner at Eight") and a novelist on her own ("Giant").
GEORGE S. KAUFMAN: He wrote only one play on his own, but with various collaborators Kaufman became one of the most successful playwrights and directors in Broadway history. He directed the original "Guys and Dolls," and some say he wrote Groucho Marx's best lines.
BEN HECHT: A peripheral Algonquinite. Hecht was a Chicago newspaperman turned playwright and an immensely talented screenwriter. With Charles MacArthur he wrote such Broadway and Hollywood classics as "The Front Page" (directed on stage by Kaufman) and "Twentieth Century."
RING LARDNER: A sportswriter and short-story writer on friendly terms with the Round Table.
CHARLES MACARTHUR: Like his partner Ben Hecht, MacArthur was a newspaperman turned playwright and screenwriter. He and his wife, Helen Hayes, sometimes dropped by the Round Table.
HERMAN J. MANKIEWICZ: Once Kaufman's assistant in The New York Times's drama department, in Hollywood Mankiewicz became a prolific screenwriter and producer. He co-wrote "Citizen Kane" (how much was his and how much Orson Welles's is a subject of endless dispute).
ALICE DUER MILLER: A sometime Algonquinite. She wrote the poem "The White Cliffs of Dover."
DOROTHY PARKER:Famous as a poet, short-story writer and wit ("Men seldom make passes/At girls who wear glasses" is hers). Parker published several books before heading to Hollywood. By the 1930's she was already in a steep decline, though she lived until 1967.
ROBERT E. SHERWOOD: An original Algonquinite, and a great friend and colleague of Parker and Benchley at Vanity Fair. Sherwood began writing plays seriously ("The Petrified Forest" and "Waterloo Bridge") only after he walked away from the Round Table.
DONALD OGDEN STEWART: A humorist and essayist. Stewart was a Round Table member who became one of Hollywood's sharpest screenwriters (including "Holiday" and "The Philadelphia Story," both based on Philip Barry's plays, and the early screwball comedy "Laughter.") His Hollywood career ended when he was blacklisted.
JAMES THURBER: The great New Yorker writer, cartoonist and all-around satirist. His path crossed that of the Round Table.
ALEXANDER WOOLLCOTT: The Algonquin Round Table started at a lunch in Woollcott's honor in 1919, and he was always at the group's center. His drama criticism (first for The New York Times, then for The New York Herald and The World) made him a Broadway power. He went on to do radio shows and commercial endorsements, and actually appeared on tour in "The Man Who Came to Dinner," whose lead character was based on him. CARYN JAMES

Hoving's Adventures At the Met

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
Making the Mummies Dance By Thomas Hoving Illustrated. 448 pages. Simon & Schuster. $25. 
In "Making the Mummies Dance," his bizarre, nasty and ultimately disheartening account of his stormy 10-year reign as director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Thomas Hoving gloats about a bit of heads-up detective work. He writes that as a candidate in 1966 for the directorship, he discovered, unbeknownst to museum officials, that "the relentless State Commissioner for Human Rights, Eleanor Holmes Norton, was preparing to hit the museum with a series of legal charges alleging massive abuses in the hiring practices and promotions of women employees." His "shocker," he recalls, stunned the trustees, and he implies that it helped him to win the job.
 This anecdote is vintage Hoving for its combination of skulduggery, one-upmanship, bravado and unreliability. In 1966, Ms. Norton was working for the American Civil Liberties Union and had no dealings with the museum; she never served as State Commissioner, although in 1971 she became chairwoman of the New York City Commission on Human Rights. Furthermore, according to the museum, no such investigation of hiring practices took place until 1971, during Mr. Hoving's own tenure; and then it involved the office of the New York State Attorney General, not Ms. Norton, who this week confirmed the inaccuracies of Mr. Hoving's story.
 Details, details. Mr. Hoving does not let them get in the way of this docudrama of a memoir, which, like the incident with Eleanor Holmes Norton, has little to do, in the end, with art, and sheds too little light on the running of a great museum.
 The author makes embarrassing art-historical blunders: he refers to frescoes by Verrocchio, although none exist by the artist; twice Mr. Hoving attributes a portrait by David to Ingres; he calls the artist Bramante, who was born near Urbino, a Florentine. And he packs his book with extensive and spicy quotations, many now at least 20 years old, by dozens of people, some of whom have since died, lots of whom sound suspiciously like Mr. Hoving: this, from someone who admits in his book that as director he "embellished the truth."
 Moreover, in skewering one enemy after another, Mr. Hoving comes across as having a chip on his shoulder the size of the Euphronius krater, that imposing ancient Greek pot of questionable provenance whose purchase by the Metropolitan caused one of the bigger brouhahas of his tenure. He calls one curator "something of a dunce" and accuses another of "a pattern of sloth and manipulation"; a trustee is written off as "a bumbling lightweight," while Charles and Jayne Wrightsman, consistent and remarkably generous supporters of the museum, although inconsistent supporters of Mr. Hoving, are described as "cardboard-thin, moving through life by rote."
 Yet the real problem with "Making the Mummies Dance" has to do not with its petty slipups, its spasms of revenge and its incredible anecdotes, but with the fact that the author has chosen to make such trivial matters the substance of his work.
 Mr. Hoving obviously knows the impact of his directorship was not trivial. With typical egotism, but in this case with some justification, he takes credit for "the most sweeping revolution in the history of art museums." Indeed, he is probably the most influential and innovative museum official of the postwar period, and the issues of his tenure from 1967 to 1977 are indeed sweeping and very much still alive.
 He by no means invented the idea of the blockbuster show, nor the notion of opening up art museums, partly through educational programs, to a wide public: the Museum of Modern Art, for one, was working along those lines decades before Mr. Hoving came along, and Frances Henry Taylor, as director of the Metropolitan during the 1940's and early 50's, strove to make the museum more accessible.
 But Mr. Hoving carried those ideas forward with extraordinary zeal, and from the bully pulpit of his position as director of the country's premier art museum he spread with extraordinary success the gospels of expansion and populism. The vast building programs, the stream of lavish loan exhibitions smartly designed like department store displays to broaden their appeal, the ambitious accompanying catalogues, the whole notion of the art museum as public spectacle -- which all came to characterize the museum world of the 1970's and 80's, but which in their way were outgrowths of 1960's thinking -- can be partly traced to Mr. Hoving and the groundbreaking Metropolitan Centennial celebrations organized by George Trescher under Mr. Hoving between 1969 and 1971.
 His legacy is immensely complicated, all the more so because his increasing fixation as director on banalities like museum shops and attendance figures tends to obscure the more idealistic and substantive aspects of his era. One thinks of his longtime rival, J. Carter Brown, who as head of the National Gallery of Art in Washington charted a much steadier course in masterminding grand, popular shows and a physical expansion program, but whose record of acquisitions -- the most enduring legacy a director leaves behind -- cannot compare.
 One also thinks of Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim Museum's current director and Mr. Hoving's heir as museum innovator and art-world lightning rod. Like Mr. Hoving, Mr. Krens gives the impression that he conceives of museums in terms of money and power and of artworks as commodities and prizes. But unlike Mr. Hoving, he has not also demonstrated (at least not yet) any eye, or genuine feel, for art.
 Mr. Hoving is an easy scapegoat for every excess of the museum world -- for the commercialism and overexpansion that followed in his wake -- and he makes himself all the more so by this once-over-lightly, tattletale memoir. But in fairness, he oversaw the organization of exhibitions of historic importance that combined widespread popularity with seriousness of purpose, like "19th-Century America," "Masterpieces of Tapestry" and "The Year 1200," as well as calamitous events like "Harlem on My Mind" (whose anti-Semitic catalogue introduction Mr. Hoving defends interestingly, although unpersuasively, in "Making the Mummies Dance").
 It's obvious, in retrospect, that the sale of art, or deaccessioning, that took place at the museum under Mr. Hoving was as disastrous and ill-managed as his critics at the time thought. But he also oversaw a renovation and expansion of the Metropolitan that transformed the institution from what was widely regarded as a dingy, sleepy place into a glittering palace, more coherently organized, with new wings for the Temple of Dendur, for Nelson Rockefeller's African, Oceanic and Mesoamerican art collection, for Robert Lehman's outstanding collection of Old Master and 19th-century paintings and drawings and decorative arts, and for all the other treasures that came into the museum's possession under Mr. Hoving.
 How curious, in retrospect, was the turmoil that the Metropolitan's expansion plan caused. Conservationists, alarmed about encroachment on Central Park, railed against it and especially against Mr. Hoving, a former Parks Commissioner whom they considered a turncoat. Politicians argued that the museum should, instead, disperse its holdings among the city's boroughs, an attempt to trump the populist director at his own game.
 Today, the idea of dispersal is widely discredited. And Central Park is undiminished. The downside of the expansion plan has to do with other matters, with the banality and pomposity of the architecture, with the mediocrity of Dendur, with the dubious deals that were cut, like the one allowing the Lehman collection to become a museum within the museum. When Mr. Hoving gets around in his book to analyzing the impact of expansion, after dozens of pages chronicling the wheeling and dealing that brought it about, he writes all of three paragraphs, acknowledging the drawbacks of the Lehman bequest, briefly noting the complaints of critics and asserting that the Grand Staircase should have been demolished, more escalators and elevators installed and a bigger garage built. He sums it up in a macho sound-bite: "If the master plan possesses one failing, it is not, as these critics suggest, that it is too big, but that it is too little and too cowardly."
So it goes throughout "Making the Mummies Dance." About deaccessioning, Mr. Hoving accepts blame for public-relations gaffes that included lying; but he does not debate the merits of the works that were sold, like a van Gogh whose value rose far beyond what the Metropolitan got for it, or like three Max Beckmanns whose sale drastically diminished the museum's German Expressionist collection. Nor does he debate the wisdom of having almost sold such works as a grisaille Odalisque by Ingres, which under Mr. Hoving was in storage but which lately has been revalued and put prominently on view. Had he engaged fairly in such debates, it would have been much harder for him to defend his actions. He eschews serious reflection as if fearful of boring readers whom he has enticed by juicy gossip. In this respect, the book is a fitting analog for the failures of his populist agenda, with its confusion of style for substance and of mass appeal for mass edification.
 Just how appealing the book will be, however, for the masses unfamiliar with Mr. Hoving's cast of characters and unconcerned with the minutiae, say, of his battle to construct a parking garage beneath the museum, is an open question. To insiders, on the other hand, it can be riveting, but in a morbid sort of way, as one waits for the next water balloon to drop on the head of one or another of Mr. Hoving's enemies.
 "Making the Mummies Dance" is in the end most revealing as a romp through Mr. Hoving's quirky mind. Just when one is thinking that the author is a cold, driven man given to dangerous extremes, he confesses that he's "a very hard, driving and cold man" who goes "overboard, which I tended to do more and more as the years went on." He admits that he has "never had close friends," he refers to himself as a toady, hypocrite and shark, and he quotes without rebuttal a colleague's criticism of him that he has a "craving for admiration and tendency to lapse into self-pity." He is disarmingly, almost touchingly, self-critical, and at times even tougher on himself than he deserves. He is as eager to trumpet his faults as his triumphs, because it is the trumpeting that seems to count, the need -- as it was when he was director, and even at the risk of self-sacrifice -- to "always be in the news."
His book provides, especially in its stories about organizing blockbusters, a number of timely parables about the pitfalls of glitz. But it mostly holds up a distorted lens through which everything in the museum world seems to depend on the director. Mr. Hoving, as he would clearly be the first to say, is a clever and complex man and there is a great and substantive book to be written about his years at the Metropolitan. "Making the Mummies Dance" is not it.

HEADLINE: Shannon McCune, 79, Educator, Geographer and Asia Expert, Dies

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
Shannon McCune, an educator, geographer and specialist in Asian studies, died Monday at his home in Gainesville, Fla. He was 79.
 His family said he died of congestive heart failure. 
Dr. McCune, a former president of the University of Vermont and provost of the University of Massachusetts, was an expert on the geography of the Far East. Besides his academic positions he was director of Unesco's education department in Paris and held several United States Government positions as an Asian expert.
 He served as the first civil administrator of Japan's Ryukyu Islands from 1962 to 1964, when the islands were under American military control. He returned to Okinawa, the main island, in 1970 with a research grant from the National Science Foundation.
 
Began Teaching in 1939
 He was born in Sonchon, Korea, the son of Presbyterian missionaries. He received a bachelor's degree from the College of Wooster, in Ohio, a master's degree from Syracuse University and a Ph.D. in geography from Clark University in Worcester, Mass., in 1939.
 Dr. McCune began his teaching career in 1939 at Ohio State University. In 1947 he went to Colgate University as chairman of the geography department, where he remained until 1955.
 He was provost of the University of Massachusetts from 1955 to 1961. In 1965 he was named president of the University of Vermont, but resigned in 1966 to do research for the university in the Far East.
 Dr. McCune was director of the American Geographical Society of New York from 1967 to 1969. He then went to the University of Florida in Gainesville as a professor and chairman of the geography department, retiring in 1979.
 
Won Medal of Freedom
 He served with the Foreign Economic Administration in India, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and in China, for which he won the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1946, and was educational consultant to a United Nations development mission in the Indonesian province of West Irian in 1967.
 In addition to scores of articles and monographs on Asian geography, Dr. McCune was the author of several books, including "Korea's Heritage, a Regional and Social Geography," published in 1956 by the Charles E. Tuttle Company in Rutland, Vt.; "Korea: Land of Broken Calm," published in 1966 by the Van Nostrand Company in Princeton, N.J., and "The Ryuku Islands," published in 1975 in England.
 He is survived by his wife, the former Edith Blair; two daughters, Antoinette Bement of Jamaica, Vt., and Shannon Wagner of Pittsburgh; a son, George Blair McCune of Anchorage, and seven grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Taking the Big Plunge Into the Sea of Mutual Funds

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
Call them the investments of the 90's.
Millions of people have discovered that mutual funds are a simple, low-cost way to own stocks and bonds. The funds allow investors to minimize their risks by spreading their money among many securities. They are easy to buy and sell and, perhaps most important, they give buyers an investment edge because the money they put into funds is managed by professionals. 
 With those advantages, it is not surprising that one in four Americans now owns shares in mutual funds, and their number is growing as people abandon certificates of deposit and other forms of insured savings that now offer low interest rates.
In 1992 some investors struck gold in funds. The top-performing fund, Fidelity Select Savings and Loan, soared 57.8 percent in value. Second- place Oakmark gained 48.5 percent, and third-place Fidelity Select Regional Banks, 48.6 percent. But there was bad news, too. Lexington Strategic Investments, 1992's worst performer, plummeted a dizzying 60.7 percent.
To help investors pick winners, The New York Times is publishing a table today showing the 1992 performance of more than 3,000 stock and bond funds. The table, which begins on Page 37, identifies funds by the kinds of securities they invest in and also gives their performance over the last five years. A second table lists average returns for more than 80 different kinds of funds, so you can compare a fund's performance with how well its peers are doing.
These tables provide the information you need to get started in funds. If you are new to the game, and apprehensive, relax -- you are not alone. More than half of the new customers calling Fidelity Investments about mutual funds described themselves as investment beginners, Fidelity found in a recent survey. So did a quarter of their existing investors. Lack of confidence about making investment decisions isn't confined to novices or young people. While they are older than 50, on average, only 24 percent of Fidelity's customers described themselves as experienced.
So let's start from the beginning. Behind the hype is this reality: a mutual fund is simply a way to let a small investor behave like a big investor. Funds, called investment companies, pool your money with other people's and use it to buy stocks, bonds and other securities. Investors own shares in the fund proportionate to the amount they invest. Each share represents ownership of part of the fund's underlying securities, and share prices are based on the current value of the fund's holdings. If the value increases (or drops), the fund's share price rises (or falls).
Fund investing is convenient. You can do business by mail or by telephone. Most funds let you automatically reinvest dividends, a good way to save systematically. (A system called dollar cost averaging, investing the same amount of money regularly, can reduce the average cost of your shares over time.) Because fund shares are priced daily, you always know what your investments are worth, and you can sell out at any time, just as you can with stocks. Many funds belong to families of stock, bond and money market funds, so you can build a balanced group of funds with one company.
Of course, funds are not without their own set of problems. Gains may be shaved by high expenses and up-front charges, or loads. Not all the professional managers of the funds are prudent and prescient, and some have lost money for their investors. Moreover, members of investment clubs for many years have been reaping rich rewards by taking the risk of putting money into individual stocks and bonds. And late last year, in a rather startling opinion, Peter Lynch, former manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund and arguably the best mutual fund manager ever, suggested that investors might be better off picking their own stocks.
So with those caveats in mind, people who want to begin picking funds should first get a grasp of the concept of investment risk. The goal is to match the fund's risk level to your own.
There are three basic types of risk. Market risk is the risk that the value of your investment will decline. Credit risk is the risk that a bond issuer will not pay the interest owed or the principal amount at maturity. Inflation risk is the risk that when you sell, the dollar you get back may be worth less than the dollar you invested. And remember that no fund is insured like a bank deposit.
One basic rule applies to all investments: the greater the risk, the greater the potential reward. Conversely the less risk you take, the smaller your potential return. No investments are risk-free -- even federally insured bank accounts are vulnerable to inflation risk.
Investors were spoiled during the 80's, an unusual time when low-risk investments like bank accounts and certificates of deposit paid hefty yields. Today those yields have evaporated, forcing investors into higher-risk alternatives.
How much risk should you take? That depends largely on how long your money will be invested. The more time you have, the more risks you can afford because historically the stock market has risen in spite of temporary declines.
Before moving onto the where's and how's of buying funds, you should learn about asset allocation, a fancy word for dividing your money among a variety of investments to reduce risk. Think about splitting your holdings among several types of stock and bond funds and also consider investing overseas as well as in the United States.
Investors who enjoy researching the market can save money by buying shares in no-load funds directly from the company. You pay no sales charge but still pay fund administrative expenses, of course.
Start by finding funds with good five-year records in the tables. Consistent performance from year to year is important; it's risky to buy a fund based on one good year's performance because it may not be repeated. Funds are ranked by "total return," which measures changes in share price plus income.
 
For Further Information
 You can get more information in reference works like Morningstar Mutual Fund Sourcebook or Standard & Poor's/Lipper Mutual Fund Profiles, which your local library may own.
Most fund companies have toll-free telephone numbers (call the toll- free directory at 1 800 555-1212). Trained telephone representatives can answer questions from whether the fund manager who built the track record is still there (always ask!) to how to fill out forms to open the account.
Otherwise, you can buy funds through stock brokers or financial planners, who are compensated by the load, or sales charge, levied by about two-thirds of all funds. Low-loads charge from 1 to 3 percent, mid-loads, 4 to 6 percent of the amount invested. Paying a load reduces your return because less of the money you invest buys fund shares. Loads are not included in the returns listed in the table.
Every fund has an investment objective that the fund manager works toward. These are designated by the abbreviations used in the tables.
 
Riskiest of Funds
 The riskiest of the five major types of stock funds are capital appreciation funds. Next are small-company funds, this year's winner with a gain of 12.5 percent. Then come growth funds, which invest in stocks of more established companies.
Growth-and-income funds aim for capital appreciation plus income by owning high dividend-paying stocks plus some bonds. So do equity-income funds, which focus more on yield.
Specialty funds invest in narrow sectors like health care or gold stocks. Because of that, they shine when the markets favor their sector and sink when it doesn't. In 1992, financial services funds gained 35.3 percent, for example, while gold funds fell 14.6 percent. But top performers over longer periods usually are the more diversified growth funds.
Hybrid funds combine stocks and bonds in varying proportions. Balanced funds usually own 60 percent stocks, 40 percent bonds while flexible funds shift the proportions.
Bond funds are staples for investors who want income. Along the spectrum of credit risk, government bond funds are least risky. Next come high-quality corporate bond funds and then junk bond funds.
Because rising interest rates push down bond prices, short-term bond funds carry the least amount of market risk, followed by intermediate- and long-term bond funds. The usual rule applies: the greater the risk, the higher the yield.
Expenses are critical in bond funds because returns move in narrower ranges than stock funds. Make sure your fund's expenses are in line.
Tax-free bond funds probably will soar in popularity if President-elect Clinton raises tax rates because the interest they pay is free of Federal taxes, and also may be free of state and local taxes. Remember, however, that capital gains are taxable.

HEADLINE: TOP BOSNIAN AIDE IS SLAIN BY SERB

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Serbian nationalist troops besieging Sarajevo shot and killed a top official of the Bosnian Government today after halting a United Nations armored vehicle that was carrying him from Sarajevo airport into the city.
Members of a hard-line faction in the Government immediately announced that they would not return to peace talks with their Serbian nationalist opponents until they were given convincing assurances that the Serbs were genuinely seeking peace. 
 [ Alija Izetbegovic, the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina, said in New York that his Government was discussing whether "to withdraw the Bosnian delegation from the negotiations" in Geneva, The Associated Press reported. Speaking at Kennedy Airport, where he met with Vice President-elect Al Gore before returning to Bosnia, he said he didn't know whether a decision had been made.]
 
Appeal for Restraint
 The slain official, Hakija Turajlic, was one of three Deputy Prime Ministers of the Muslim-led Bosnian Government, which has been struggling to survive a war with a secessionist army of Serbian nationalists. Mr. Turajlic was in charge of economic policy.
Gen. Philippe Morillon of France, the United Nations commander for Bosnia and Herzegovina, called the killing "one of the most detestable violations in this conflict."
General Morillon, fearing that the incident could provide the spark for a major Bosnian counteroffensive, appealed to both sides for restraint.
"It's a catastrophe," he said after an emergency meeting with the top officers of the 7,500-man United Nations military force. "I will try to convince everybody that it is perhaps not the reason to start the war again, but perhaps on the contrary a reason for everybody to understand that this tragedy has to stop as soon as possible."
The killing took place as Mr. Turajlic, 47 years old, was inside an armored personnel carrier belonging to the French marine battalion assigned to the United Nations forces. The vehicle, painted white and bearing the blue United Nations flag and insignia, was halted about 500 yards from the airport exit gate by two Serbian tanks and what General Morillon described as a force of 30 to 40 Serbian soldiers.
General Morillon said the Serbian troops demanded that the three French soldiers operating the vehicle hand over Mr. Turajlic. The soldiers radioed for help and were joined by the French officer who commands the airport, Col. Patrice Sartre. A confrontation lasting one hour and 45 minutes ensued, which ended with a Serbian soldier thrusting his automatic weapon over Colonel Sartre's shoulder and firing at Mr. Turajlic through the vehicle's open rear door.
The general said that Mr. Turajlic, who joined the Bosnian Government last year after serving as managing director of an industrial conglomerate in the former Yugoslavia, was struck by seven bullets, three in the chest, and died instantly.
General Morillon said that the Serbian soldiers withdrew from the scene immediately, and that Colonel Sartre, acting under United Nations rules of engagement that allow soldiers to open fire only to save lives, decided not to fire back.
General Morillon said Mr. Turajlic had requested a United Nations armored vehicle to take him to the airport, along a notoriously dangerous route that runs between Serbian and Bosnian front lines, when the United Nations headquarters was unable to make arrangements for a Turkish Government delegation to enter the city. The general said that the Turkish officials had arrived at the airport aboard a Turkish aircraft at lunchtime, with virtually no advance notice, and that United Nations officers had agreed to take Mr. Turajlic to meet the Turkish officials at the airport.
The Serbian troops rushed onto the road ahead of the United Nations vehicle as it returned to Sarajevo at 4:30 P.M., dusk in the Balkans at this time of year. General Morillon said the Serbian soldiers had told the French soldiers that they had seen the Turkish aircraft and knew that it had carried 150 Turkish troops to join the Bosnian forces in the defense of Sarajevo. General Morillon said the Turkish aircraft had carried relief supplies..
The general said that he had ordered an inquiry to establish several key points, including why the French marines, outnumbered 10 to 1, had not been reinforced during the protracted standoff by other soldiers from the French battalion that has its headquarters at an airport garrison that is within sight of the spot where the killing occurred. The general also said he wanted to know why the rear door of the armored vehicle had been opened, against normal procedures here. "I think it was because the Serbian soldiers wanted to inspect the vehicle for weapons," he said.
 
Following U.N. Guidelines
 The general said Colonel Sartre's decison not to call in more French marines followed established United Nations practice here. He said Serbian nationalist forces had repeatedly halted United Nations armored vehicles at gunpoint, ordered their doors opened and searched the vehicles, usually on the pretext that they were carrying arms for the Bosnian forces. Normally, the general said, such incidents are resolved without resort to force. "We are not prepared for such madness," he said.
"I have asked the Serbian side not only to arrest the author of this assassination, and they say he is under arrest, but also to arrest the commanding officer responsible for the decision that had these results."
For the United Nations force, the killing was the second major embarrassment in four days. On Tuesday, the operators of a home for the elderly that is only 750 yards from the United Nations headquarters on the embattled western edge of Sarajevo announced that 10 residents had died in 36 hours of the zero-degree cold that has settled over the Bosnian capital. Their deaths brought to 190 out of 302 residents at the home who have died since the Bosnian war began last April.
Employees at the home had appealed to United Nations commanders for help in evacuating the residents from the battle zone for at least four months, and, if evacuation was impossible, for wood-burning heaters to stave off the bitter Balkan winter. But because of what United Nations officials described as a failure of communications, nothing was done for the residents of the home apart from weekly deliveries of food supplies, even after all electricity in Sarajevo failed and cut off the home's only heating.
Even before the setbacks this week, the United Nations force here appeared to be in serious trouble. It has operated under a mandate that limits it to negotiation with the warring sides, and the rival factions have repeatedly taken advantage of this lack of military authority.
 
Blow for U.N. Commander
 General Morillon, 57, who took command of the force in September, appeared to take today's killing as a personal blow. The United Nations force has had 17 of its own men killed, many of them by mortar and sniper fire from Serbian or Bosnian troops around Sarajevo.
But General Morillon, like his predecessor, Maj. Gen. Lewis W. Mackenzie of Canada, has consistently spoken out against the alternative to the United Nations peacekeeping force, which many believe should include Western military intervention.
General Morillon named the officer commanding the Serbian troops who carried out the killing as Gen. Stanislav Galic, a top commander of the Serbian fighters in Bosnia and Herzegovina, most of whom belonged to the Yugoslav Army garrison stationed in Sarajevo before Bosnia declared its independence. General Galic's tanks, artillery and antiaircraft guns have inflicted most of the heaviest damage on Sarajevo, where an estimated 55,000 people have been killed or wounded during the siege.
The leaders of the Serbian nationalist cause in Bosnia were reported to be attending a meeting in the eastern Bosnian town of Zvornik. General Morillon said he had been told that the session was to decide policy for the resumption of the Geneva peace talks, where both Serbian and Bosnian Government leaders have balked at a joint United Nations-European Community plan to divide Bosnia into semiautonomous regions under a weak central government.
 
Peace Talks in Doubt
 Ejup Ganic, a Bosnian vice president, said that the decision not to resume negotiations in Geneva had been made "here, in Sarajevo, by those running the Government" in the absence of President Izetbegovic.
"It's a great tragedy," Mr. Ganic said. "Hakija Turajlic was absolutely the most efficient, competent minister in this Government."
"I think we shouldn't go to continue talks in Geneva unless the aggressors show that they are for peace," Mr. Ganic said. "If we continue like this, they will kill each of us, one by one, until there is no Government left."
The killing appeared likely to strengthen hard-liners in the Bosnian Government, including Mr. Ganic, who have differed with Mr. Izetbegovic in the past over his decision to continue negotiations with the Serbian nationalists. Mr. Ganic and the Bosnian military commander, Maj. Sefer Halilovic, have taken the position that any negotiated settlement with the Serbian nationalists, who now occupy about two-thirds of the republic, would amount to a surrender, and that the Bosnia Muslims should resolve to fight on, regardless of the costs.
At the United Nations, in New York, the Security Council said in a statement that it was "profoundly shocked" to learn of the killing of Mr. Turajlic "while he was under the protection of the United Nations Protection Force." The Council called his death an "outrageous act of terrorism," a "grave violation of international humanitarian law" and "a flagrant challange to the authority of the United Nations force.
The Council also asked Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to investigate in the killing and report back "without delay."

HEADLINE: Issues of Survival for Declining Union

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
The latest painful labor battle at The Daily News is a sign of the decline of the power of unions in the New York City newspaper industry, highlighting deep and, some say, permanent divisions between New York unions that once derived their power from unity.
It showed how weak newspaper unions have become in an age when technology has made it possible for publishers to put out newspapers without union members, and thus is a watershed in the labor movement and in the news industry. 
 The New York Newspaper Guild, which represents news, advertising and circulation employees, is fighting for its life as a credible union after a third of its members at The Daily News became unemployed this week because of the actions of Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the new Daily News owner.
 
Another Struggle Exposed
 The struggle of the guild, the largest of the city's newspaper unions, exposed a little mentioned debate in newsrooms over whether unions have a place there. A number of reporters and editors, the beneficiaries of better pay and greater prestige won over several generations, see themselves as professionals who have moved beyond the need for labor alliances forged by their predecessors.
And, perhaps most important, this week's events raised questions about whether a union can be called a union at all if it must stand by without a strike, a job action or a picket line, while an employer demands that union members apply for their own jobs. After The Daily News's bankruptcy, and the guild's failure to reach an accord with Mr. Zuckerman, the new publisher took advantage of his legal right to view the newspaper as a newly created business and the 540 guild employees as job applicants.
"This is yet another sign of how feeble labor unions are generally and particularly in the news industry in New York," said Mitchell Stephens, chairman of New York University's department of journalism and the author of a book on the history of the news business.
"It is a very sad day," Mr. Stephens said yesterday, "for people who know the accomplishments of labor in the development of the New York City press."
The guild is now relying on a call for a readers' boycott and a planned "corporate campaign" to have supporters stop doing business with Mr. Zuckerman's real-estate and publishing enterprises. It is also pressing for continued negotiations with Mr. Zuckerman.
That the union has fallen back on the boycott tool, often used in battles that do not involve unions at all, is a symbol itself of the defensive posture forced upon the guild. Nearly half its members eventually crossed the picket lines of the five-month Daily News strike two years ago. Even many of those who supported that strike knew, as the crisis was building with Mr. Zuckerman in recent weeks, that another strike would never win the support of the guild rank-and-file.
 
Methodical Approach
 A strike would almost certainly have failed. Mr. Zuckerman methodically won contracts with the only unions that can still stop newspaper production and delivery, the unions representing pressmen and drivers, and with the other trade unions. As the guild headed toward what Mr. Zuckerman said was an inevitable winnowing of its ranks, he had 9 of The News's 10 unions on his side.
Together, those unions, their joint umbrella group, the Allied Printing Trades Council, and the council's influential president, George E. McDonald, repeatedly signaled the guild that they had the deal they wanted. It was clear that the other unions would have broken a guild strike.
Even if the union manages to stage what would now be viewed as a comeback at The Daily News, the guild has lost enormous ground. This week's events come after signs of growing dissension in the union citywide. The guild represents employees at The New York Times and The New York Post and other major New York news organizations. For several years, dissidents have openly criticized the union's leadership for what they say is passiveness with publishers and undemocratic union management.
Barry F. Lipton, the guild president, acknowledged yesterday that this week's events were a serious blow. He said the union was made vulnerable partly because Federal labor law allowed what he called Mr. Zuckerman's effort to break the union. He also said the union was on the defensive because the new publisher was able to isolate the guild from the other Daily News unions.
Some guild members who are critics of the citywide leadership acknowledge that the weakness of the guild is due in large measure to declining loyalty of members. At The New York Post, Mr. Lipton was criticized for negotiating a take-it-or-see-the-newspaper-die deal in 1990 with Peter S. Kalikow, the publisher.
Mr. Lipton has been under fire at The Post ever since by a group of dissidents who say he gave away too much. He has repeatedly said the deal was the only option. It cut employee work weeks, and pay, by 20 percent and generally reduced the ranks and morale of guild members.
Karen Phillips, the secretary of the guild local at The Post, is one of Mr. Lipton's critics. But this week, she acknowledged that the problems of the guild are more fundamental than internal politics.
"Most of the people in newspapers," she said, "don't understand unions. They think they're for auto workers."
In most industries, a union's weakness is best measured by the reaction of management when a union gets into difficulty at one company. Competitors see that as an opportunity.
It is the same in the news business. In response to a question yesterday, Nancy Nielsen, a spokeswoman for The New York Times, said that Mr. Zuckerman's actions would not necessarily require changes at The Times.
But, she said, The News labor situation "is bound to have some effect; we don't live in a vacuum." The Times's current contract with the guild expires in March.
At The Post, even before Mr. Zuckerman had completed his staff reduction, Mr. Kalikow saw an opportunity. "Assuming he tries to assassinate the guild, which is what he seems to be doing," Mr. Kalikow said this week, "I'm sure we will be able to negotiate a deal which improves our position."
Yesterday, Tonice Sgrignoli, a copy editor who has been one of the most vocal guild members at The Daily News, said this week's events suggested that the guild, after telling its members to follow management instructions to apply for jobs with Mr. Zuckerman, may be so weak now that it cannot rightly be called a union.
"When I was told to reappy for my job, I said: 'Why don't we just admit it: We don't have a union.' "
Ms. Sgrignoli did what the union recommended and applied for the job. In the envelope she received on Thursday, there was a form letter telling her that her application had been rejected.

HEADLINE: U.S. JOBLESS RATE SHOWS NO CHANGE

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Employers' payrolls grew by a modest 64,000 jobs in December as the nation's unemployment rate remained at 7.3 percent, the Labor Department said today in a report that underscores how slowly the job market is reacting to economic expansion.
The figures were somewhat disappointing in light of recent drops in first-time claims for jobless benefits and other indications that the economy is slowly recovering from the recession. 
 The employment report appeared to increase the chances that President-elect Bill Clinton, who has been meeting with his economic advisers this week in Little Rock, Ark., would undertake an aggressive program of fiscal stimulus. The current unemployment rate is half a percentage point higher than the 6.8 percent that prevailed in March 1991, the month recently designated as the bottom of the recession.
 
Deficit Outlook Worsens
 The latest lackluster job data came two days after President Bush, in his final budget, projected deficits over the next several years far deeper than the Administration had estimated as recently as July. This would tend to deter Mr. Clinton from trying to buoy the economy by extra spending on highways and other public works projects. Despite nearly two years of expansion in the national output, sluggish though it has been, American employers have added no more workers than absolutely necessary. The strategy has been to use existing workers for extra hours and to work them harder and to make greater use of temporary employees.
"Companies are just reluctant to hire in this period of increased global competition," said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist for Morgan Stanley & Company. Instead, he said, the emphasis is still on improving efficiency, a boon for the economy in the long run but in the short run a many-faceted problem, often involving hardships for individuals.
Today's report, the first broad appraisal of the economy's performance for December, included numerous revisions, aberrations and adjustments that combined to reinforce the recent pattern of a weak pickup in demand for workers.
"In general, we can say that the trend of recent months has been one of slow improvement," William G. Barron Jr., the Deputy Commissioner of Labor Statistics, told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
The gain of 64,000 in nonfarm payrolls was toward the lower end of expectations, analysts said, but the increase would have been fairly respectable had it not been for the absence of poll watchers and other temporary election workers who, the Labor Department estimated, swelled November payrolls by 45,000.
 
Weather Played a Role
 Similarly, the length of the average workweek in private industry declined 18 minutes, to 34.3 hours, but much of the drop was attributed to severe storms that hit the Northeast in mid-December. The workweek at factories, meanwhile, rose for the third straight week to what the department called a "very high" reading of 41.3 hours.
Factory jobs, however, edged up just 3,000 after growing 25,000 in November and employment in construction fell another 5,000 to remain below levels a year earlier.
This meant all the growth was in services, mainly business and health services, as slower-than-normal seasonal hiring in department and clothing stores was offset by increases at auto dealers, restaurants and bars.
The Government survey of households showed more job growth, 247,000 in December, than did employers' payrolls. But because the labor force grew by 226,000, there was no change in the unemployment rate.
 
Plenty of Revisions
 The jobless rate had initially been reported at 7.2 percent for November but was moved up today to 7.3 percent after the annual applications of updated seasonal adjustment factors. The jobless rate for April was also revised one-tenth of a point higher for April but was lowered by that amount for May, June and July.
The number of so-called discouraged workers -- those who have stopped looking for jobs because they think it futile -- declined 42,000 in the tabulation for the fourth quarter, but the rounded total remained 1.1 million, the same level that has prevailed since the third quarter of 1991.
Regionally, the Midwest continued to post the lowest jobless rate even though it showed a rise last month to 6.1 percent from 5.9. In the Northeast, the rate rose to 8.1 percent from 8, but the South and West both had declines, to 6.7 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively.
The number of Americans working part time because of economic reasons -- the so-called partially unemployed -- eased by about 150,000 during December to 6,349,000, a number that has shown little trend over the last year.
The average spell of unemployment lasted 19.2 weeks, up from 18.4 weeks in November and returning to the October level. Those out of work more than 15 weeks climbed 159,000 while the newly unemployed -- jobless for less than five weeks -- fell 78,000.
Reflecting the shorter workweek, average weekly earnings slumped 1 percent last month, prompting fresh doubts among some analysts about the ability of consumers to sustain their vigorous spending pace of recent months.
Today's report also showed that the department's index of aggregate weekly hours -- a proxy for industrial production -- fell to 121.1 last month from 122 in November. On the other hand, 52.9 percent of industries added to their payrolls in December, up from 50.6 percent and the fourth straight increase.
Over all, said Joan D. Schneider, economist for Continental Bank in Chicago, "It's heartening that things are getting better, but the improvement is pretty anemic relative to what we were doing before the recession."

HEADLINE: New York City Is Star Of Showbiz Expo East

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Despite its brassy name and exuberant commercialism, the Showbiz Expo East, which ends tonight, is more than just a trade show. The high-decibel, high-tech convention that has commandeered the New York Hilton for the last two days has become a continuing referendum on the viability of New York's film-, theater- and television-production industries.
Many of the 6,000 entertainment-industry managers, production workers and technical apparatchiks attending the event expressed delight simply that the Expo, a Los Angeles institution for the last nine years, had actually come to New York for the first time. This is, after all, a winter in which the city's entertainment industry finds itself still mired deeply in a recession, even though economists tell us the nation is on the rebound. According to a new study unveiled at the Expo, there are also lingering effects of the talent drain caused by the nine-month Hollywood film boycott that ended in 1991. 
 The main preoccupation of conventiongoers, in fact, whether they were schmoozing in corridors, seated in panel sessions or navigating through a three-floor circus of 200 exhibitors' booths, was a trio of recurring questions: How bad is the city's entertainment economy? Will more jobs leave for the South, the West and the Canadian North? Will the work come back if the economy improves under a new President?
The answers varied widely, from unvarnished gloom to irrepressible optimism.
Barry J. Shapiro, a producer and director of commercials, said that a lot of New York film companies had gone out of business "and didn't pay their bills, and there are a lot of horror stories out there about that."
Alan Eisenberg, executive secretary of Actors Equity, said that "actors have been fleeing the city and the East Coast because they can't make a living." For those who have stayed, he added, there has been a reduction not only in the number of weeks worked each year, but also in salary levels.
Alison Johns, the editor of Millimeter, the motion-picture-industry magazine, said, "Things pretty much hit bottom when 'Lost in Yonkers' was filmed in Cincinnati."
A somewhat rosier assessment was offered by Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project. "Going to the cold shower of the 90's from the Jacuzzi of the 80's has been good for all of us," she said. "It's good, facing reality. New York City is not going to drop off a cliff, and we want to be ready when the good times come again."
Thomas F. Leahy, president of the Theater Development Fund, agreed. "I'm an Irish Catholic," he said, "and I believe that all growth comes out of pain."
 
Creating 'Buzz and Momentum'
 The Expo offered more than 20 panel discussions, on theater financing and video breakthroughs as well as one that promised to show "how you can use film festivals to create the necessary buzz and momentum for your next film." There was also a session officially dubbed "Safe Sets," a discussion of liability issues on movie sets.
Or participants could simply mill around and rub shoulders with theater, film and television managers, government officials, union executives, directors, cinematographers, designers, make-up artists and prop people. Those attending the Expo paid from $25 to $195, depending upon the number of days and panels chosen.
If the convention's Showbiz name conjures images of lounge thrushes crooning in smoky nightclubs or deal-making weasels in agent suits, the reality of the Expo was an electronic bedlam of exhibitors' booths. People hawked their up-to-the-minute wares, which included underwater cameras, satellite phones, film-to-video transfer systems and theatrical fogging machines using liquid-nitrogen smoke generators, which are replacing the traditional dry-ice machines.
The cost of space ran from $1,900 to $10,000 for exhibitors, who included a film-location weathercasting company ("24 hours, 7 days, always a live meteorologist, never a recording!" a sign said) as well as an abundance of salesmen flogging 10 competing script-writing software packages, and representatives of 42 local, state and national film offices (among them Canadian, British and Portuguese), all trying to attract production companies.
Standing staunchly against this invading army was Richard Brick, the new director of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, who characterized New York as "the premiere urban landscape in the world, a tremendous investment value for any film."
Alluding to the fact that the city has never rebounded from the effects of the Hollywood boycott, Mr. Brick added, "Right now, New York could not be more user-friendly, because people are hungry now here."
Mr. Brick announced that the budget for his office had been doubled, from $500,000 to about $1 million, and insisted that the increase in funds was accompanied by a new sense of urgency to win back the movie business. Part of the extra money will be used to raise New York's visibility in Los Angeles and at the major international film festivals, he said.
The Broadway Alliance, which for the past two years has tried to fight the recession by bringing lower-cost productions to Broadway -- through cost concessions from producers, theater owners and theatrical unions -- also announced plans to expand: from 3 theaters to 10 or more. The plays thus far produced by the alliance have been critical and commercial disappointments, and some people have said that the location of the three theaters currently used has limited the interest of producers in future alliance presentations. The three -- the Belasco, Nederlander and Walter Kerr -- are some distance from Broadway's theatrical core.
 
Proposed Additions
 David S. Rosenak, the chairman of the alliance, announced that theater owners and most of the seven participating theatrical unions had agreed to add the Brooks Atkinson, the Ambassador, the Cort, the Golden, the Longacre and the Neil Simon to the current list of alliance houses.
The plan is still under negotiation, however, since Actors Equity has not yet approved the proposal to add the Eugene O'Neill and the Royale to the alliance roster. Mr. Eisenberg of Actors Equity said the union was looking favorably toward the O'Neill but not the Royale.
Perhaps the best thing the Expo provided was the chance to just hang out. "In this business, a lot of us work alone, and this is a great way to get together and realize we're all part of one family," said Bob Gerardi, an actor and composer who also produces music for film and commercials.
Richard Cohn, a gaffer, or film-crew head electrician, who lives in Brooklyn, said, "It's really great to see just how many people are alive and well and still working here."

HEADLINE: Taking Reins, Zuckerman Faces Union Challenge

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Mortimer B. Zuckerman assumed control of The Daily News yesterday with an olive branch for the news staff he had decimated in an economy measure and a firm pledge to restore his new, $36.3 million property to its glory days as New York's sassy-but-serious hometown tabloid.
"It should be, and has been, a popular and populist paper -- a street smart, sassy, serious journal for the average New York family," the new owner and co-publisher said in an interview, echoing a vision sketched earlier in a meeting with a somber, occasionally defiant news staff. 
 But even as he took over the ailing paper, Mr. Zuckerman was hit with a new challenge. The Newspaper Guild of New York -- whose ranks he had slashed by about 170 jobs Thursday night, out of 540 -- moved to start a reader and advertiser boycott of The News and a broader campaign against other Zuckerman properties in a bid to win back curtailed jobs, salaries and benefits.
 
Little Support for Guild
 Guild leaders announced that Ray Rogers, a controversial labor consultant known for organizing boycotts and other pressure tactics against J. P. Stevens, Hormel, American Airlines, International Paper and other companies since the 1970's, had been hired to run the union's fight against Mr. Zuckerman.
A spokesman for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Rex Hardesty, said the national labor organization had not yet heard about the call for a boycott by the Newspaper Guild, and he could not comment on whether it would support a boycott.
But the guild, which represents news, advertising and circulation employees, had no support among other unions and many guild members, who had lost careers overnight, expressed skepticism about the tactic. Some also were critical of their union, saying it had not protected their jobs.
On his first whirlwind day as owner, Mr. Zuckerman, 55, a real-estate and publishing entrepreneur, took a midnight tour of The New's decrepit Brooklyn printing plant, gave newspaper and television interviews and met with a news staff whose somber faces and angry remarks reflected bitterness over the fate of scores of colleagues who had been let go, many after decades of service.
 
Portrays Self as Savior
 At The News's main office at 220 East 42d Street, Mr. Zuckerman walked through the seventh-floor newsroom lined with famous front pages and the ghosts of 73 years of fast, flashy journalism. He settled himself on a desk amid jumbles of paper and bleating phones and was soon surrounded by editors, reporters and photographers, some of the survivors of a staff cut by a third.
Calm and articulate, his tone earnest but at times more forceful in response to belligerent comments in a one-hour meeting, Mr. Zuckerman portrayed himself as the savior of The News, sketched his vision of its future and repeatedly expressed regret over layoffs he portrayed as necessary for survival of a bankrupt paper that had lost $100 million over the last decade.
He said mistakes might have been made in what some called the brutal way the layoffs were handled. He also said mistakes might have been made in what he portrayed as swift decisions by subordinates on which staff members to cut. He promised to review the cuts and "rectify our mistakes if we've made them."
He wavered between apology and sympathy. "No one likes to be associated with something like this," Mr. Zuckerman said. He said that he expected to hire new employees to bring back the newsroom staffing, which he said he had reduced for reasons of quality, to its pre-layoff level, and he noted that other unions at The News had also suffered sharp staff cuts.
But Don Singleton, a reporter, contradicted him, saying the drivers and pressmen had not lost as many jobs as it seemed, but rather had a cutback of working shifts that had been filled by overtime and casual workers.
Mr. Zuckerman said that was a fair point. But he said he had sincerely tried to reach an agreement with the guild.
Tom Robbins, a reporter who had been on the guild negotiating committee, disputed him. "You never put a final offer on the table," he said.
The voice of Juan Gonzalez, the columnist, shook with anger as he spoke of his shock over the way the layoffs had been handled and demanded to know what management deadwood Mr. Zuckerman might cut. Mr. Zuckerman, his face flushed, said there would probably be a "merit adjustment" for management workers and repeated forcefully his desire to have a productive work force at all levels.
Larry Sutton, another reporter, asked if staff assignments would be shuffled. Mr. Zuckerman said his attention had been so focused on the details of buying The News that he had had little time for editorial direction beyond hiring a new metro editor, Richard Esposito, from New York Newsday.
He underscored his commitment to building a new $150 million color printing plant for The News in the next 18 months.
After the meeting, many staff members streamed out to a meeting at Guild headquarters on West 44th Street.
At Guild headquarters, about 200 members gathered in the afternoon and spoke of their plight. Some who were let go said they were eligible for a buyout equal to two and a half weeks' pay for every year of service, paid weekly over a long time, or two weeks pay for every year paid in a lump sum. They said they were also entitled to 18 months of health benefits at a favorable group rate.
Some who were still on the staff said they had been offered lower-paying jobs, with salary cuts ranging from $50 to $400 a week. Those offered jobs said they had been offered the options of taking buyouts or staying on at current seniority, waiving rights to severance benefits.
Those who stay will be given a new health insurance policy. Under the new policy, they said, they will have to pay 25 percent of their health care costs.

HEADLINE: Word of Bosnian's Killing Cuts Clinton Briefing Short

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
The President of Bosnia, Alija Izetbegovic, was briefing Clinton aides on the negotiations in Geneva to end the killing in his country when the news arrived of his Deputy Prime Minister's assassination by Serbian gunmen.
Though Mr. Izetbegovic struggled to contain his emotions in the face of the news and the open weeping of some of his aides, the meeting broke up about 15 minutes later. It was a turn of events that vividly illustrated for members of the Clinton transition team the volatile nature of the Balkan crisis they will be responsible for handling in less than two weeks. 
 "It was a moment that I will never forget," said a transition official who was in the room when the news arrived of the assassination of Hakija Turalic, Bosnia's Deputy Prime Minister for Economics.
Earlier Mr. Izetbegovic, who traveled to the United States this week to drum up support for his country, met with Bush Administration officials who urged him to "remain engaged" in the Geneva peace talks.
 
Boycott Is Possible
 Janet Amon, an official with the Bosnian Mission to the United Nations, said tonight that Mr. Izetbegovic was considering boycotting the Geneva talks because of the killing.
Ms. Amon said the Bosnian President was considering taking part in a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Countries in Dakar, Senegal, next week, instead of traveling to Geneva.
Mr. Izetbegovic later said that his Government was discussing whether "to withdraw the Bosnian delegation from the negotiations" in Geneva, The Associated Press reported. Speaking after a meeting in New York with President-elect Al Gore, the Bosnian President said he did not know whether a decision had been made.
Administration officials had originally declined to meet Mr. Izetbegovic for fear that it could be seen as an opening for him to pull out of the talks.
"We discussed the Geneva process and our side expressed the belief that it is the best hope for peace," said an Administration official who insisted on not being identified. The official said the Administration was not taking a position on any of the specific proposals that have been put forward, including a plan to devide Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous regions. The plan has been criticized as legitimizing aggression by Serbs who now control the majority of Bosnian territory.
 
News of Killing
 Immediately after the meeting with Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, and Arnold Kanter, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, at the White House, Mr. Izetbegovic told reporters that the slaying was "not only an attack on our Government, but at the same time it is an attack upon the United Nations."
Mr. Turajlic was riding in a United Nations convoy traveling from Sarajevo Airport when the armored vehicle he was in was stopped by Serbian gunmen, the general commanding the United Nations force in Bosnia and Herzegovina said. After an hour and a half the confrontation ended when a Serbian soldier shot the minister, firing over the shoulder of the United Nations commander on the scene.
Clinton aides said their meeting with Mr. Izetbegovic took place this afternoon in a hotel room in the Georgetown section of Washington. An official with Mr. Clinton's transition team said the Bosnian leader had pulled out a map and was explaining how the country would be divided under a plan that had been put forward by Cyrus R. Vance, the former United States Secretary of State, and Lord Owen of Britain, co-chairmen of the Geneva talks.
As Mr. Izetbegovic began his explanation, one of his aides burst into the room and informed him in his native language that Mr. Turajlic had been killed. Hearing the news, several of Mr. Izetbegovic's aides began sobbing.
 
Pressure to Join Talks
 Leon Fuerth, a transition official who works in the foreign policy area, reportedly asked Mr. Izetbegovic if he wanted to recess the meeting to regain his composure. But the Bosnia leader chose to continue.
But after about 15 minutes, it was decided that the discussion should resume later.
In recent days, the Bush Administration and the Clinton transition team have vacillated over whether they should meet with him. Mr. Vance expressed concern that meetings with Mr. Izetbegovic would upset the delicate negotiations.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Izetbegovic said he had been pressed into entering into the Geneva negotiations by Mr. Vance and Mr. Owen. The Bosnian leader said the two men told him that he risked responsibility for the failure of peace efforts if he declined to take part in the talks.
At a breakfast sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Mr. Izetbegovic said that Bosnians consider it "to be a humiliation" for him to be negotiating with Serbian leaders whom he considers war criminals.

HEADLINE: Region Adds Jobs but Data Remain Mixed

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in December rose a bit in New York State and dropped in New Jersey, but employment among residents of both states increased, offering further evidence that their recession-ravaged economies are bottoming out.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in New York increased to 8.4 percent, from 8 percent in November, while New Jersey's rate fell to 8 percent from 8.7 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday. Data on Connecticut were not released yesterday. 
 "The negatives are losing force and the positives are strengthening," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the bureau's regional commissioner. "We're seeing the tide of the decline receding. The improvement is agonizingly slow. It is coming in fits and starts but it's there."
The number of employed New Yorkers rose by a scant 31,000, to 7,872,000, in December from 7,841,000 in November. But there was also an increase in the active labor force, or those seeking or available for jobs. That increase accounts for the rise in the unemployment rate.
New York City's unadjusted unemployment rate rose to 11 percent in December from 10.5 percent in November. The number of city residents with jobs rose by 45,000. Seasonally adjusted data for the city were not available. Seasonal adjustment is an attempt by the bureau to help make comparisons more meaningful by compensating for temporary factors like increased retail hiring during the Christmas season.
"Manufacturing job losses in New York State have slowed to a trickle, jobs in business services are showing some gains for the first time in several years and retail trade has picked up slightly," Mr. Ehrenhalt said. "Among the major industries, only construction is still cutting back substantially."
The preliminary average unemployment rate in New York State for all of 1992 was the highest in nine years at 8.5 percent, up from the 7.2 percent average in 1991.
 
New Jersey Job Picture Improves
 New Jersey's unemployment rate last month was the lowest since April. December was the third consecutive month that the rate has been below 9 percent. The number of New Jersey residents with jobs increased in December by 69,000, or more than twice the number in New York State, to 3,697,000.
"In New Jersey, there have been no further declines in manufacturing jobs for several months, construction is stabilizing and employment in services has been moving up for several months," Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
New Jersey's preliminary average unemployment rate for 1992 was 8.4 percent, the highest in a decade. The 1991 average was 6.6 percent.

HEADLINE: Iraq's War of Nerves

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
The latest showdown between Washington and Baghdad demonstrates once again, two years after the fact, how sharply the denouement of the war in the Persian Gulf differed from what the victorious allies expected at the time.
By defeating Saddam Hussein's armies in the field, President Bush and other Western leaders concluded, they had weakened him to the point that he would either be toppled in a coup or find it impossible to resist the enforcement of the United Nations resolutions designed to curb his powers. 
 But the Iraqi President remains in charge, and he has retained enough power to tweak the nose of the United States and the United Nations again and again. He hindered the inspection teams trying to prevent Iraq from rebuilding a nuclear capacity. He cut the routes used by convoys carrying relief supplies to the Kurds in the north. And then he moved surface-to-air missiles into position to threaten allied plans patrolling the no-flight zone in the south.
 
No Quick Solutions
 With only 10 days left in his Presidency, Mr. Bush took to the phones again, lining up support for air strikes against the Iraqis if the missiles were not moved. But whether they are moved far enough fast enough to suit the Americans, the President is in no position in the gulf -- any more than he is in Somalia or Bosnia -- to wrap up the trouble neatly before Jan. 20 and present Bill Clinton with a relatively clean foreign-policy slate.
If Mr. Hussein complied with the allied demands, which he would almost certainly do only while proclaiming to the world and to his own people that he had no intention of doing so, or if he dismantled the missiles, as appeared possible tonight, little would be resolved. He would retain the capacity to move them into a hostile position once more, or to test the allies in other ways.
A number of Middle East analysts, for instance, fear that the Iraqi leader may try to further suppress resistance among the Iraqi Kurds, who live along the border with Turkey. Between 1988 and 1989, Iraqi troops are believed to have killed more than 150,000 Kurds, perhaps as many as 200,000, and Pentagon officials said Baghdad retains ample military capacity to carry out another such slaughter.
If the missiles are not moved, and air strikes are carried out, a possibility that seemed to be receding as the deadline passed, it is difficult to see how the strikes could have more than a transitory effect. Iraq might lose some anti-aircraft missiles or some other aging military equipment if Mr. Bush decided to strike at the missiles themselves. He might lose more if the raids hit established bases rather than the mobile missiles, but nothing that he could not quickly replace.
According to American intelligence reports, the Iraqis have kept their best missile batteries, equipped with Soviet-built SA-11's and SA-13's, well north of the no-flight zone imposed to protect Shiite Muslim rebels. The missiles that were moved there, touching off the present crisis, are older, obsolescent models considered expendable.
 
Former Allies Unallied
 But the resistance of nations like Egypt, Syria and Turkey, which were crucial allies in the 1991 conflict, will make it very difficult to strike at Baghdad itself, European diplomats said. Nor is there much support for attacks on the resources that keep Mr. Hussein in power, from the rebuilt munitions factories to the barracks of the elite troops based in the Baghdad region.
The high-tech weapons of which American commanders were so proud during the war, and which constitute one of the main Western advantages in the continuing conflict with Mr. Hussein, are of very limited use in this situation.
From Mr. Hussein's point of view, the war of nerves is very useful. It gives him a chance to posture as the defender of Iraqi sovereignty, as the man who takes the West right to the brink. To the degree that that prompts feelings of patriotism and diverts attention from the raging inflation and the epidemic of shortages caused by economic sanctions, he is clearly the beneficiary.
Laurie Mylroie, a scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, thinks the Iraqi President and his circle are convinced that they won the war, in the sense that they clung to power in the face of overwhelming firepower and diplomatic strength. They "stood up to the Americans."
"Watching him on Iraqi television when I was there in November," Ms. Mylroie said, "it was stunning to see his self-confidence and his arrogance, and his evident pleasure in public adulation, however obviously coerced. Bombing isn't going to change that much. It has very limited utility."
Mr. Clinton, she suggested, will have to decide for himself whether to reformulate American goals to include the elimination of Mr. Hussein or accept the fact that the Security Council resolutions cannot be fully enforced until he loses power.
 
An Uncertain Policy
 In a speech in October, Mr. Clinton, who rather reluctantly supported the use of force in the gulf two years ago, hinted that he might adopt a tougher policy in the region if elected. It was a mistake, he said then, to urge the Kurds and the Shiites to resist and then do little to support them.
But the President-elect has never suggested that he would be willing to contemplate allied military incursions to help the rebels. At any rate, such an intervention would almost certainly be resisted by the Pentagon on the ground that it constituted an open-ended commitment in an unstable region.
Today, Mr. Clinton remained the foreign-policy team player he has been since November. Mr. Bush had consulted him "about the action that the President proposed to take," he said, "and I agree with the action."

HEADLINE: Visiting U.S. General Warns Haiti's Military Chiefs

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Jan. 8

 BODY:
As part of intensive joint efforts by the Bush Administration and aides of President-elect Bill Clinton to settle Haiti's political crisis and avert a renewed flood of refugees, a United States Marine Corps general, in a visit here, has warned Haitian military leaders that they must quickly recognize the country's exiled President.
The officer, Maj. Gen. John Sheehan, told the Haitian High Command that any solution of the crisis must include their recognition of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown in a military coup on September 1991, Haitians and Americans close to the discussions said today. 
 In a tense meeting at Haitian Army headquarters, they said, General Sheehan, who was dressed in formal uniform, warned the military leaders that if the country's crisis was allowed to fester they would not "be able to look to their American counterparts for any kind of sustenance."
 
A 'Window of Opportunity'
 Later, General Sheehan told the military leaders that if they quickly ended their opposition to a return of democratic government the United States was prepared to resume nonlethal aid to the Haitian military as part of a program to professionalize a ragtag and undisciplined army. In the second of two long meetings on Thursday night, General Sheehan began preliminary explorations of what shape such aid might take.
The general ended a 72-hour visit here this morning. Commenting on his visit, the first by a high-level American officer since the coup against Father Aristide, a senior Bush Administration official said that for the first time in months there was now a "window of opportunity" for settling Haiti's crisis.
The official pinned his cautious optimism on what he described as the "unprecedented cooperation" between incoming and outgoing Administrations in sending a clear message to all parties to the Haitian crisis, the recent decision by the United Nations to become involved, and "fear in Haiti of harsher measures to come as well as simple exhaustion."
Other than the warning by General Sheehan that the United States would not help extricate members of Haiti's High Command if the crisis was allowed to deteriorate, officials said no direct threats of punitive action had been made.
 
Pressure on President, Too
 Although the United States Embassy said General Sheehan's visit was part of a long-planned swing through the region, diplomats and Haitians involved in discussions toward a political solution here said that the military exchange represented part of an aggressive and concerted push by the Bush Administration, aides to Mr. Clinton and the United Nations.
While talks were under way here, a participant said, Father Aristide, who has lived in exile in Washington since his overthrow, was being told by these same parties that his cooperation was also expected and that concessions must be made by his side as well.
In 15 months of on-again, off-again efforts to settle Haiti's crisis, diplomats say, the country's army commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, has steadfastly sought refuge behind a series of civilian governments backed by the military, blocking progress by refusing to become directly involved in political discussions.
At the same time, when settlements have appeared close, Father Aristide has balked at the last moment, the diplomats say. At other times, they say, he has simply refused to engage in the negotiating efforts.
The prospect of a resurgence of Haiti's refugee crisis has brought high-level attention to the country's problems in Washington. This attention, coming on top of the recent decision by the United Nations to supplement an ineffective Organization of American States as a broker here, appears to have brought a level of urgency to the situation that for the first time in months has raised hopes for an early solution.
 
'An Offer You Can't Refuse'
 "The U.N. and the U.S. are all together banging home the same message to both the generals and to Aristide saying this is an offer you can't refuse," said a participant in the discussions who declined to be further identified. "And there have been enough communications back and forth so that each side knows what kind of lumps the other is taking."
Asked for an assessment of how General Sheehan's message was received by General Cedras, another person with knowledge of the talks said of the Haitian High Command, "Even though nobody exactly told them the wrath of God was about to come down on their heads, they were pretty shaken up."
But despite the coordinated international efforts to resolve the crisis, an official warned, "There are still many things which could come unraveled here by the work of any number of actors, from refugee groups to Father Aristide's supporters to elements of the military to human rights people to the Haitian Parliament."
Among the many questions that remain unresolved are the selection of a new Prime Minister who would be acceptable across Haiti's deep divides between left and right and rich and poor. Even thornier, diplomats say, is the fate of General Cedras, whose punishment or exile has been demanded by Father Aristide for his role in the coup.
In recent diplomatic discussions, General Cedras has sought to justify the coup by saying that it was an attempt to block Father Aristide's threatened use of political violence.
In his talks with Haitians officers, General Sheehan told them that "a professional military is one that is subservient to civilian authority and your explanations are not sufficient," a person close to the discussions said.
But in recent weeks, senior American officials have said that in addition to the troubling remarks of the populist President during his seven-month tenure, they are now convinced, bolstered by an F.B.I. investigation of the matter, that Father Aristide personally ordered the killing in prison of one of his most bitter opponents, Roger Lafontant, while the coup was under way. Father Aristide's supporters deny this.
Also undetermined is the timing for Father Aristide's return once a settlement is reached. In the past, diplomats have said the Haitian President could return only after a substantial interim period during which the country's economy was revived and all its institutions, from the army itself to the judiciary to health care and education, were stabilized. Father Aristide and many of his supporters have held out for a quick return.
Another potential stumbling block are plans by the provisional Prime Minister, Marc L. Bazin, to hold legislative elections on Jan. 18, which diplomats say are intended to pack the Parliament with Mr. Bazin's supporters, hence blocking Father Aristide's return or sharply curtailing his powers. Despite a seeming willingness to cooperate, elements of the armed forces were most likely backing these efforts behind the scenes, several diplomats said.
"Perhaps we'll have an agreement before then," one said. "I know that is what we are pushing for. Then Marc Bazin will not be a factor and we can avoid a whole other layer of complication."

HEADLINE: Dow Off 17.29 in 4th Fall in Row

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Queasy investors sent stocks zigging and zagging yesterday, leaving the Dow with its fourth straight drop in heavy trading and a loss of almost 50 points for the first week of the year.
The Dow finished with a decline of 17.29, about half a percent, to 3,251.67 yesterday after sagging by as much as 37 points earlier in the session. 
 Still, the Dow's decline overstated the broader market's retreat only somewhat, as Big Board losers decisively outnumbered gainers.
Many itches in many places seemed to account for all the scratching and selling yesterday and this week. The greatest irritant, perhaps, was the outlook for the coming Clinton Administration, with growing doubts about whether President-elect Bill Clinton can fulfill his pledges to cut the Federal budget deficit and stimulate the economy at the same time.
 
Pause to Reap Profits
 Some traders said investors were merely pausing to take profits they have rolled up since fall. Others said they wanted to reduce their risks in view of a possible showdown between the United States and Iraq.
The bond market also had a rough week, with the 30-year Treasury bond sliding again yesterday, raising the yield to 7.46 percent. [Page 50.]
Yesterday's report that unemployment remained at 7.3 percent in December convinced some investors that Mr. Clinton would have to spend vigorously for the economy to generate more jobs.
Yet analysts and traders were more inclined to treat the week as a post-election, post-holiday letdown than an ominous start to the new year.
"You had your Clinton honeymoon and everyone felt good," spending heavily for Christmas, said Edward M. Kerschner, chief strategist at Paine Webber. "Now people sit down and say, 'What's he actually going to do?' But there hasn't been any change in fundamentals."
 
Buyers Find Bargains
 Those fundamentals -- low interest rates, a gradual recovery and strong investor enthusiasm -- assure some money managers that stocks can remain at levels that by most measures are high.
Indeed, the Dow came more than halfway back from its lows in mid-afternoon yesterday once investors saw some favorite stocks at tempting levels.
Among the prominent winners yesterday were stocks that had done the worst earlier in the week. Philip Morris, beaten down earlier by the threat of increased tobacco taxes and regulation, gained 1 3/8, to 74, yesterday in heavy trading. Medical stocks also recovered, with Baxter, Merck, Lilly and Johnson & Johnson each gaining at least a point.
Airlines and railroads continued to advance, propelling the Dow Jones transportation average up 8.06 points, to 1,488.29, for a 39-point 2.7 percent gain during the week. Analysts say that transportation stocks will benefit from the recovery in the United States without suffering from slowdowns abroad.
Smaller stocks, which advanced twice this week on days the Dow industrials fell, continued to fare somewhat better than larger issues yesterday. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks slipped just a point, to 677.21. Among those falling was Intel, which broke a string of strong advances by falling 7/8, to 98 3/4, yesterday as Nasdaq's most active stock.
 
Buy Recommendations
 Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman, Sachs & Company is among the analysts still saying that those companies likely to prosper in the early phases of a domestic recovery -- retail, transportation, media and some technology -- are now the ones to buy.
While some of these issues resisted the market's decline for much of the week, yesterday's selling was widespread. Procter & Gamble, Woolworth, Boeing and Exxon were among widely held stocks losing a point or more.
National Medical Enterprises, the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, fell 1 3/4, to 9 7/8, after The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday on the ramifications of complaints of malpractice and fraud at the company's psychiatric hospitals.
I.B.M. fell 1/2 point, to 46 1/2, in heavy trading, down 3 7/8 for the week to levels last seen in the computer punchcard era of the 1970's. A few brave analysts predicted a rebound, saying that year-end selling for tax and reporting reasons had pushed I.B.M. below its real worth.
Some investors seeking havens apparently left the stock market altogether for short-term Treasury issues, the traditional parking place for timid money.
 
'Flight to Quality'
 "It's a flight to quality from equities," said Dennis Jarrett, chief market analyst at Kidder, Peabody. "People don't want to hold stock too heavily over the weekend. They don't know what's going to happen in Iraq."
He attributed last week's high volume to outright confusion, in a churning market that has made money managers shift investments from sector to sector as they wonder about what to do next.
Few analysts are still counting on a January rally like the ones they used to know. Rao Chalasani, the chief investment strategist for Kemper Securities, told investors to cut back their stock holdings by 10 percentage points, to 50 percent for the conservative or 60 percent for the aggressive.
"The January effect was in October," he said.

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
The next two weeks may determine whether the incoming Clinton Administration and the nation's Roman Catholic bishops lock themselves into a moral and political cold war. When the head of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote President-elect Bill Clinton a month ago, offering prayers for his success, the good wishes masked some serious difficulties the bishops are having in settling on a stance toward the new Administration.
One sign of this groping is the very date of the letter -- more than a month after Mr. Clinton's election. The delay reflects a fundamental disagreement between the church and the new Administration over an issue that has generated more than its share of discord over the years: abortion. Already there are signs that this disagreement could shape their whole relationship. 
 At a meeting at the bishops' conference in mid-November, James Cardinal Hickey, the Archibishop of Washington, even asked whether it would be appropriate for a Catholic prelate to share a public platform with the incoming President. And in the Vatican there are reports of intense discussions about the United States, quite possibly echoes of the consternation felt by some of the American hierarchy.
It would be wrong to dismiss this edginess as something without consequences for the new Administration. Mr. Clinton is too savvy not to recognize the damage that a cold war with the bishops could do to his plans. The church has significant influence on issues like health care, welfare reform and child care -- issues on which Mr. Clinton is placing his highest hopes.
There is also great potential for an alliance. In the 1992 campaign, Mr. Clinton contended that his agenda and the Democratic Party's "historic commitments" to social-welfare issues were much closer to the Catholic Church's social vision than Republican ideas were.
Many bishops would agree, up to a point. Fighting poverty and helping new immigrants with housing and health care are not abstract concerns for the bishops; they have seen the church's charitable resources often stretched to serve four times as many people as they did 10 years ago.
At a more philosophical level, Mr. Clinton's notion that the Government has a responsibility to redress economic and social inequities certainly comes closer to the Catholic tradition than Reaganism did.
But for the bishops, abortion has a special place on their moral and political horizon, much as Israel's security has for leaders of Jewish groups. To opponents of abortion it is a life-and-death matter, generating the kind of passionate repudiations of compromises or half measures that AIDS has generated among gay rights groups.
To have a Presidential campaign so unambiguously identify itself with abortion rights, as the Democratic Party did at its convention in New York last July, was deeply disturbing to the bishops. All the more so because it proved to be far from similarly disturbing to the electorate, which did not let its mixed views on abortion overshadow its clear-cut desire for new leadership.
In this sense, even if Mr. Clinton's victory was not a statement about abortion, it was a statement about the politics of abortion -- and a stinging loss for the anti-abortion movement. While that may eventually compel the movement to reassess its strategy, its first public response has been to appeal to the troops to demonstrate greater dedication than ever.
So the Catholic bishops, despite their tendencies toward caution and pragmatism, are feeling both political and moral pressures to take an adversarial stance toward the new Administration.
That would mean renouncing the chance to influence important proposals on issues where the church and the White House might share common ground. But it could also mean reducing the chance to influence their own parishioners, who may not welcome a manifestly uncooperative attitude toward a Presidency in which they, along with many other Americans, have invested their hopes.
So far, the bishops and Mr. Clinton appear determined to avoid this kind of cold war, working together when possible and disagreeing when it is inevitable. The most significant of Mr. Clinton's positions on abortion, his support of abortion-rights legislation, may not become a live issue while the new President and Congress concentrate on the economy.
But the annual anti-abortion march in Washington on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade will take place on Jan. 22, two days after Mr. Clinton's inauguration. At least one Cardinal will address marchers at a service on Jan. 21.
Mr. Clinton has promised to remove Federal restrictions on research using tissue from aborted fetuses, on abortion-related procedures in military hospitals overseas and on the information about abortion that can be provided by federally financed clinics.
If he honors those pledges swiftly, issuing the necessary executive orders immediately after his inauguration -- and on the eve of the anti-abortion march -- a quick conflict can be expected. The church will be publicly represented by Cardinals who need not check their statements with other members of the hierarchy. They will be speaking to a fervent audience eager for words of uncompromising condemnation.
Right then and there, the pattern may be set.

HEADLINE: Japan Takes a Pre-emptive Step on Auto Exports

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Japanese auto executives said the Government's decision today that it would extend for another year its current ceiling on automobile exports to the United States was an effort to head off expected demands from the new Administration in Washington for more trade concessions.
But the continuation of the voluntary export restraints at 1.65 million cars for the fiscal year that begins in April is not expected to please United States auto makers, some of whose executives have been seeking tighter limits. Harold A. Poling, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, has said Japan should cut the ceiling to 1.3 million cars or less. He said in Detroit today that Japan's decision to maintain export quotas at the current level would not help ease trade problems.
 
Ministry Denial
 Auto executives here say they suspect Japan's Government announced the export cap before President-elect Bill Clinton takes office later this month to pre-empt possible demands for a lower ceiling by the new Administration, which has promised to be more aggressive in helping American industries. 
 But an official in Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry denied this, saying the decision on export restraints is disclosed at this time almost every year. He said the export cap was extended in recognition of the problems the Big Three auto makers, particularly the General Motors Corporation, are facing.
Auto executives here say Japan's trade ministry considered lowering the ceiling but feared it would hurt Japan's own auto companies, which are in a severe slump because of falling sales in their home markets and weak economies abroad.
In Washington today, Kathleen Lydon, press secretary for the United States trade representative, declined to comment on Japan's decision on export quotas, citing a policy of not discussing voluntary Japanese trade arrangements that are not bilateral deals.
In recent years, exports to the United States have been below the ceiling because Japanese auto makers have been shifting production to their United States factories. For that reason, the restraints have been derided as meaningless.
Last year, the limit was cut to 1.65 million vehicles from 2.3 million, but exports are expected to be slightly below even this lower ceiling for the current fiscal year, ending in March.
But Japanese Government officials and auto industry analysts say that if the automobile sales in the United States grow in the coming year, as expected as the American economy recovers, Japanese companies might want to increase their exports. In that case, the restrictions could begin to bite, though not in a major way.
"The Japanese won't be able to expand their sales as fast as the market might improve, which means that the Japanese market share comes down," said Benjamin Moyer, analyst for Merrill Lynch in Tokyo.
He said, however, that such supply problems will not arise in the next year or so because the Japanese companies still have room to increase production at their American plants to make up for a shortfall in exports.
The Japanese automobile companies seem willing to live with the quota system, which has caused them little pain while helping to mollify a major trading partner.
Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of the Nissan Motor Company, said in a statement today that the Government's decision "takes into account the overall Japan-U.S. relations and is a realistic measure."
But American auto makers take a different view. The heads of the Big Three auto makers and of the United Automobile Workers union met with Mr. Clinton in Little Rock, Ark., earlier this week and at least some of the officials were believed to have sought a lower ceiling on Japanese exports. It is not known what Mr. Clinton's reply was, but the auto executives and Owen Bieber, the union chief, said they were pleased with the meeting.
Rather than focusing on Japanese auto exports, the Big Three American auto makers have agreed to focus on Japan's overall trade deficit, which is affected in the automotive sector by the export of engines and other parts. The auto makers have said they wish the new Administration to take a tough stand on pushing Japan to reduce that deficit any way it can.
In Detroit today, Mr. Poling of Ford told the Economic Club of Detroit that the decision by Japan not to lower its export quotas would worsen the country's trade deficit with the United States. He said the decision by the Japanese "shows they are not very concerned about it."
He said the automotive portion of the trade imbalance had remained at about $33 billion a year since 1986.
John F. Smith Jr., president of G.M., and Robert J. Eaton, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, reiterated at the Detroit meeting statements they made to President-elect Clinton earlier in the week seeking help for the domestic auto industry.

Boston Bank To Double Loan Funds

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WALTHAM, Mass., Jan. 8

 BODY:
Officials of the Bank of Boston said today that they would double, to $6 billion, the amount of new loans they had pledged to make in New England by the end of next year.
The nation's 21st-largest bank holding company said it was increasing the amount because of greater-than-expected demand under a loan-marketing program it announced in May to lend $3 billion to consumers and small businesses in New England. 
 Officials said the bank had lent $2 billion of the $3 billion in only seven months without lowering its credit standards. They said the bank logged 7,800 calls to a toll-free telephone number since May.
 
Suggests New Demand
 "That suggests to us that there are a lot more people out there who can use loans and who are creditworthy," Ira Stepanian, the Bank of Boston's chairman and chief executive, said today at a forum the bank held here.
Thomas Theurkauf, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, an investment bank specializing in bank stocks, said the lending program appeared to be successful, but that it was not unique to the region. "The other major banks, and for that matter the smaller banks, are also in the process of reinvigorating their marketing programs," he added.
Mr. Theurkauf said that while demand under the Bank of Boston program appeared strong, it was difficult to determine how much was from existing customers of the bank. "It's a marketing program and a useful one, but I don't think anyone can say it's caused $2 billion in activity," he said.
Mr. Stepanian acknowledged that his bank and others, under fire from regulators for making bad real estate loans in the 1980's, had slowed New England's recovery by reacting with "undue caution" to recent loan requests. But he said the Bank of Boston was now "seeking to dispel the notion that banks are unwilling or unable to make loans."
The bank can make $6 billion available because it has had five profitable quarters, raising $558 million in the last year from stock sales and earnings.
The Bank of Boston is seeking new borrowers mainly among creditworthy small businesses, Mr. Stepanian said. Of the 1,200 businesses that have been promised loans so far, 1,000 are small businesses that requested loans of less than $1 million, and 38 are businesses in inner cities.
But small-business owners said they had seen no signs that other large area banks were changing their conservative lending policies.
Kerry C. Stackpole, executive director of the 1,400-member Small Business Association of New England, said a survey in November showed that 45 percent of his association's members were still having trouble getting loans despite the perception that the New England economy may be turning around.

HEADLINE: Economists Meet, and Puzzle Over a Slump

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif., Jan. 8

 BODY:
The recession has been pronounced over, but a panel of economists at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association this week said traditional economic theory failed to explain why it ever happened.
"My overall assessment is that you cannot explain this one," said Robert E. Hall, the Stanford University economist who heads the committee that formally sets dates for the beginnings and ends of recessions. In a paper, he rejected the eight or so standard causes of recession -- things like high interest rates or declining government outlays -- as having caused this one. 
 Two panelists and many of the 200 or more experts in the audience seemed to agree that an unusual event had occurred in mid-1990, one that someday might enter history as a consumer spending version of a stock market crash.
People suddenly stopped buying. The trigger was clearly the Persian Gulf crisis and the danger of higher oil prices, which did not occur. The Persian Gulf shock should have worn off in a few months, and consumers should have returned to more robust buying, without bringing on a recession. After all, people had the income to buy more and the room to take on more debt, but they did not do either. And their reluctance, their loss of confidence, cascaded through the economy.
"In 1990, for some reason, consumers got scared and stayed scared," said Olivier Blanchard, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist. "They have spent much less than we would have predicted from past experience and income." Mr. Blanchard, who has studied the phenomenon, labeled it "negative animal spirits."
While acknowledging the phenomenon, Mr. Hall said the fall in consumer buying seemed insufficient to have resulted in the free fall in the economy that occurred in 1990 and 1991.
Nevertheless, no one at the session, including Mr. Hall and Mr. Blanchard, offered assurances of good times ahead, despite the pickup in retail sales over the holiday.

HEADLINE: Rutgers Feels Cuts, but President Won't Cry

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Jan. 7

 BODY:
Dr. Francis L. Lawrence's desk in the president's office at Rutgers University is clean and tidy, but his agenda for the state's flagship campus is cluttered with fallout from New Jersey's slumping economy.
State financing for the 48,000-student network of undergraduate and graduate schools has declined outright since the economy went into recession in 1989. As Dr. Lawrence begins his third year on the job, Rutgers is scrambling to make up $121 million in salary increases to which it is already committed and to postpone needed maintenance, including work on the balky elevator at the law school that stranded a Federal judge between floors last year. 
 Faculty members who greeted Dr. Lawrence's installation as a relief from what they perceived as the imperious administration of his predecessor, Edward J. Bloustein, now complain that they find Dr. Lawrence aloof, particularly on budget questions.
"I was as high as the sky on him when he came here," said Stanley Hall, a chemistry professor on the university's Newark campus. "Now I'm kind of at a low ebb."
Meanwhile, the faculty union, whose contract expired in June, is talking about a "job action" after students return from winter break on Jan. 19 if the administration does not agree to such requests as higher pay for teachers with long tenure and more liberal family leave policies.
At the same time, the faculty union is supporting members of student government who have disrupted meetings of the university's governing board and staged sit-ins at university buildings to protest tuition increases and demand funds for a statewide student lobbying group. Amid these challenges, Dr. Lawrence maintains an air of managerial aplomb that might seem more attuned to his former role as provost of Tulane University, the private university in New Orleans that he left in 1990, than to the hurly-burly of a public institution with four times the enrollment.
He is moving ahead with his own agenda, confident that the faculty will settle, that the State House will open its purse and that disruptive students will behave. His focus is on strengthening undergraduate instruction that suffered over the last decade as administrators focused on new construction and on scientific research. He is requiring more thorough examination of the academic achievements of prospective faculty members, has created refresher courses in teaching for faculty members who want to improve their skills and is attacking the organizational red tape that he thinks contributes to frazzled tempers in hard economic times.
 
What Chaos?
 He scoffed at reports of despair and chaos at the university.
"Do you see chaos around here? No," he said. "Am I backed into a corner by the funding cuts? No. Am I convinced that the state is not doing enough for us? Yes."
Dr. Lawrence's "top, highest priority" is to restore the ranks of full-time faculty members at Rutgers, which has hired an increasing number of less expensive part-timers over the last four years. The university's New Brunswick campus employed just 10 part-time instructors in 1989, and has 113 today.
The president also wants to attack the $110 million backlog of needed maintenance and repairs that has accumulated since the mid-1980's, when the backlog was just $10 million.
Besides creating a vice presidency for undergraduate education and a faculty and student committee on reforming undergraduate education, Dr. Lawrence opened centers for tutoring and special workshops in students' fields. In their first term last fall, 1,700 students went to the evening learning centers, and the biggest complaint seems to be that they are not open late enough.
In addition, he created training centers for undergraduate teachers, where faculty members sit down with "master teachers" for ideas on improving their work.
Dr. Lawrence ticks off these initiatives in a brisk, boardroom style with more of the M.B.A. about it than the 16th-century Romance languages and culture that are his academic specialities. He crackles with virile corporate neologisms -- "I'll ball park the figures," "We have to prioritize" and "That's my M.O."
"I'm a humanist, but I'm also a T.Q.M. type," he said in reply to a question about his style. "Total quality management. I believe in discipline, sound management and accountability."
Dr. Wells Keddie, the president of the faculty union, the campus chapter of the American Association of University Professors, credits Dr. Lawrence with improving undergraduate education. "In the last 15 years it was clear to anyone with a willing eye to see that undergraduate education was playing second fiddle to research, and Dr. Lawrence is trying for better balance."
But Dr. Keddie accused the present administration of being negative toward union negotiators. "I have decided that there are people in power in the central administration that have decide to demonize this union and its leadership."
To some students, the issue should be money today, to stabilize or even to reduce tuition, not long-range changes handed down from the president's suite of offices in Old Queens.
 
'There Is a Crisis'
 "Our position is that there is a crisis in higher education," said Rob Hill, a 1992 graduate and now head of United Students of New Jersey, whose supporters have disrupted administration meetings to press demands for funds for their lobbying group. "Most people except Lawrence seem to recognize that students are the main people who can solve this crisis, who can go to Trenton and fight for the students."
But Rebecca Rolnick, assignment editor of the student newspaper, The Daily Targum, said the depth of students' support for the undergraduate colleges' student government groups was hard to gauge.
"There is some support for the student governing associations on this, but I have no idea how much or how little, she said. "I would say that this is not something that has got people tearing down our door or writing a lot of letters to us about."
Meanwhile, Dr. Lawrence angered many faculty members by having his deans, without consulting with department members, draw up contingency plans for cutting department budgets by 5, 10 or 15 percent if the need should arise.
"My real concern is that this was done to the exclusion of the faculty," said Dr. Hall, the professor of chemistry, who is also a member of the University Senate. "They never brought this in to us and said: 'This is what might have to be done. What can you do to help?' Instead we have a lot of rumors going around about the weak departments that are going to get it."
Dr. Lawrence is not inclined to pause for the ritual bewailing of budget cuts and the grim vows to squeeze help from Trenton that the faculty union and some students want to hear.
"We have to be realistic," he said. "We have to be accountable and we have to address the problems that exist today."

HEADLINE: Shock in a Land of Lifetime Jobs: 35 Managers Dismissed in Japan

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 8

 BODY:
The unthinkable has happened in Japan, and it has touched a nerve in the ranks of the nation's middle managers.
A well-known maker of audio and video equipment, Pioneer Electronic, conceded today that it was essentially firing 35 middle managers, a candid admission that Japanese companies have begun to violate their long-cherished policies of lifetime employment. 
 Such a move would barely attract notice in the United States, where thousands of employees are sometimes given pink slips in a day. But in Japan, the commitment to keeping people employed through good times and bad is a pillar of a management system in which Japanese workers remain highly dedicated to their companies. And the move, in the midst of a severe economic slump, portends significant changes in the Japanese corporate culture.
 
 
'It Has Come to This'
 "My first reaction, honestly, was, 'My God, it has come to this,' " an automobile executive said. But he quickly added, "If the current slump continues for another year or two, a lot of companies will be doing the same thing."
Pioneer, a Tokyo-based maker of car stereos, laser-disk players and other other electronics gear, did not actually fire the employees outright, a spokesman said. Rather, it told the managers in late December that they would have until the end of January to retire.
If the managers, all in their 50's, did retire, they would receive a hefty bonus. If they didn't, they would eventually be dismissed. "This is actually, practically, a dismissal," the spokesman, Yojiro Orita, said.
Takeo Naruse, deputy general manager of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, a lobbying group, called the Pioneer move "shock therapy." He said most other companies would not resort to such drastic actions, which could hurt company morale. Still, he said, "Gradually, Japanese employment practices are changing."
To be sure, lifetime employment has never been universal. Small and medium-sized companies, which often supply components to large companies, frequently lay off workers and act as a buffer to help the big companies maintain full employment. And even at large corporations, the job guarantee does not apply to legions of part-time or temporary workers. But in the case of Pioneer, a leading electronics company, the affected managers are full-time employees.
Some experts said Pioneer's approach was a slightly stricter version of what was now happening quietly in many businesses, with managers being asked to retire for the good of the companies. The procedure is called "kata tataki," or a tap on the shoulder. Most employees accept the offer, although they usually have the option of declining if they are willing to accept lower pay or a lesser job.
Many employers insist that they are not dismissing workers, but the boundary between forced resignations and voluntary departures is becoming very narrow. "Most companies have been terminating middle managers already for a long time," said Kazunori Morishita, president of Bright Career, a firm that helps workers find new jobs. "But they don't say, 'If you don't agree, you will be fired.' "
Many economists have questioned how much longer Japanese companies can continue their practice of lifetime employment in the face of the severe economic slump. During the speculative "bubble economy" of the late 1980's, companies actively hired, believing the economy would keep expanding. Now that the economy has slowed, many employees are no longer necessary.
 
Redundant Workers
 Some economic research organizations estimate that about 1 million employees in Japanese companies, out of the nation's total employment of about 65 million, are redundant. This underemployment, which drags down corporate earnings, is in some sense a bigger problem than unemployment, which is still a low 2.3 percent.
So far, many companies have announced plans to cut thousands of employees in the next few years. But they insist they will do that by reducing hiring, offering voluntary retirements or transferring employees to other divisions or to subsidiaries.
Many companies bend over backward to avoid layoffs -- by paying people to stay home, for example. Or a steel company with excess employees might lend them to an auto company with a shortage of workers.
 
Fears of Worker Shortage
 Part of the resolve to hang on to employees stems from fear that because of Japan's low birth rates, the severe worker shortage that plagued the nation until recently will reoccur when the economy recovers.
Another aspect of Japanese management that is changing is the seniority system, in which promotions and salaries tend to rise with the length of service. That has weighed down companies with many middle-aged managers with high salaries but little opportunity to advance. Now, some leading companies like Honda and Fujitsu are moving toward a system in which pay is based on merit, at least for top managers.
"In the old, traditional system, you work long and are eventually promoted to manager," said Mr. Orita, the Pioneer spokesman. "That system can no longer work because we're moving into a severe economic situation. So we're forced to look at each manager's achievements."
Mr. Orita said the 35 employees, whose identities were being kept secret even in the company, were chosen because they were not performing up to par. Because of their seniority, many have the rank and salary of a section chief but have no one reporting to them.
 
Morale May Suffer
 Some outsiders questioned the move, saying that eliminating 35 employees out of more than 1,000 managers saves Pioneer barely any money and will hurt morale. While its profits are dropping, Pioneer is still making money, unlike many other consumer electronics companies.
A few months ago, the president of TDK, a manufacturer of magnetic tapes, proposed paying about 50 older managers 90 percent of their salaries if they would stay home until they reached retirement age. But the employees revolted, forcing the president to rescind the plan.
Mr. Orita said that when Pioneer employees learned about the forced retirements from newspapers or television -- the company did not announce them internally -- some managers were shocked and feared they would be the next to get the tap on the shoulder. But, he said, the move could raise the morale of younger executives who resent having promotions blocked by older managers who do not work as hard.
As he emerged from work today at the company's headquarters, one manager in his 30's said the action was "drastic" and would hurt morale. Another merely shrugged. "It's strict," he said, "but it's unavoidable."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Proposes to End 'Back-Door Financing'

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 8

 BODY:
It has become a familiar ritual. Every year, New York State faces another yawning budget gap. And every year, it comes up with another creative financing maneuver to balance its books and borrow money for things like prisons and roads.
The schemes have given New York State a reputation for off-budget financial legerdemain and saddled the state with one of the lowest credit ratings in the country. But on Wednesday, to the cautious praise of fiscal watchdogs who have long criticized his borrowing practices, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposed changing the way the state does its long-term borrowing.
 
No More Sleight of Hand
 Under the proposal, quasi-governmental authorities like the Urban Development Corporation would no longer be able to float bonds to build things they were never intended to build, like prisons. Nor would the state be able to sell things it already owns -- prisons, or sections of the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway -- to its own authorities to raise money to balance its budget. 
 The goal of Mr. Cuomo's plan, he said in his State of the State speech, is to "give the people more say in how much debt we create and to stop back-door financing altogether." The State Budget Director, Patrick J. Bulgaro, said that it would eventually put an end to much of the borrowing by authorities, borrowing that costs the state far more in annual interest payments than borrowing by the state itself.
 
They Want Details
 Legislative leaders said that they would have to see more details before they could comment fully on the plan. But it may have a better than usual chance in the Legislature this year, because it has the support of State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, a Republican who has repeatedly charged that the budgetary remedies favored by Governor Cuomo, a Democrat, were no better than dressed-up money-laundering schemes.
"This is really a turning of the corner," Mr. Regan said in an interview. "You can't go back after this and say, 'How about a little money here, how about a little money there.' This is just a reversal of 30 years of horseplay."
New York State now owes about $24.3 billion, which eventually must be paid back by the taxpayers. In the current fiscal year, the state is paying $2.1 billion in interest alone.
 
More Scrutiny
 Under Mr. Cuomo's proposal, the state would probably not borrow any less than it does now. But its borrowing would be more subject to voter scrutiny, and would also result in more favorable interest rates and lower interest costs, Mr. Bulgaro said.
Currently the state is allowed to put only one bond issue before the voters at a time. This forces officials either to pile a lot of borrowing into a single large package and hope the voters will approve, or to resort to backdoor borrowing without voter approval. The last two bond issues -- a $1.98 billion environmental bond act in 1990 and an $800 million jobs bond act in November -- were defeated amid deep public disillusionment over state finances.
Mr. Cuomo's plan calls for amendments to the State Constitution that would allow the state to put more than one bond issue before the voters at a time, presumably in smaller amounts, so that the voters might be more willing to accept them.
The new bonds would also be backed by specific revenue sources, like the state income tax. Currently, money borrowed by quasi-governmental authorities is paid back through annual appropriations from the State Legislature, a practice disdained as unreliable by rating agencies, which therefore results in lower bond ratings and higher interest rates.
The difficulty is that the plan would require amendments to the Constitution, a long and difficult process that means the measures would not be enacted until 1996 at the earliest. In the interim, the Governor has left some legislators leery by proposing to create a new authority that could centralize state borrowing, with tighter voter controls, until the Constitution could be amended.
"The sum total of all the reforms will raise the state's credit rating, and once the voters understand the package they will approve it," Mr. Bulgaro said. "You will get a central review of the state's capacity to incur and afford debt, and we will not borrow to eliminate budget deficits. Debt would be used for capital purposes."
Budget watchdogs and officials at rating agencies reacted to the plan with a positive but wait-and-see attitude.
Cynthia Green, the senior research analyst for the Citizens Budget Commission, a private group that monitors the state's finances, said that she welcomed efforts to change but that nothing short of a complete overhaul, including a full-scale study of the state's long-term borrowing needs, would be enough.

HEADLINE: Consumers' Borrowing Up 3d Month

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Consumers increased their borrowing in November for the third consecutive month, the longest string of advances in two years, the Government said today.
The outstanding consumer installment credit rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 percent, to $723.9 billion, the Federal Reserve said. It rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in October and 2.4 percent in September. 
 The last time outstanding credit increased three months in a row was September through November in 1990. Before the latest gains, outstanding credit had shrunk for seven consecutive months.
The November report fits with other economic indicators, including surveys showing a jump in consumer confidence after the Presidential election and chain-store reports showing the best Christmas sales in four years.
But, economists warn that the spending will not continue unless businesses pick up the pace of their hiring.
"Ultimately, for the upturn in consumer spending to be sustained, job growth has to be better because job growth affects income growth," said Allen Sinai, an economist at the Boston Company Inc., a unit of Shearson Lehman Brothers.
Mr. Sinai said the most recent job gain reported by the Labor Department, 64,000 in December, "might not sustain the optimism of the household sector that we've seen develop since the election."
Consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of all economic activity, is crucial to the recovery. During and after the recession, loans outstanding shrank as cautious consumers reduced the debt they had incurred during the go-go years of the 1980's.
In November, revolving loans outstanding edged up at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of five-tenths of 1 percent, to $250.6 billion, the fourth consecutive increase.
Automobile loans jumped at a 3.3 percent annual rate, to $257.8 billion, after a 1.3 percent decline in October.
Other consumer loans advanced at a 2.3 percent annual rate, to $215.5 billion. This category includes loans for mobile homes, education, boats, trailers and vacations.
The various changes left total consumer debt not secured by real estate at the highest total since March.

HEADLINE: Pausing to See Poverty, and to Remember Neediest

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Sure, they're New Yorkers -- pushing and shoving and scrapping their way through the day. But these people belie the popular image of the jaded and grumbling Gothamite. They do not scorn the homeless men who wander past them on the subway. They are moved by stories of middle-aged women thrown out of work for the first time in their lives by the recession.
And for them, giving to charity is a cathartic experience. They send donations to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund because they feel they must try to rid their city of some of its suffering.
 
'Maybe Next Year'
 "How fortunate we are to have the possibility of feeding our hungry as individuals," Jacqueline Simon of Manhattan wrote in a note that she enclosed with her donation of $1,000. "We do not need the marines, just our personal humanity and your fine services. How shameful it is that there are people in our generous country in the sad and dramatic straits you describe each day." 
 Other contributors also expressed frustration with poverty in New York City.
"Every year I hope the need will be smaller -- or at least no greater," wrote Lauren W. Field of Manhattan, who also gave $1,000. "Once again, I am disappointed. Maybe next year I won't be."
Added Peggy Straus of Manhattan, who sent $ 10: "I wish it were possible to say that I've noticed any kind of improvement in meeting the needs of the poor and the helpless. But if anything, their needs continue to go largely unmet, as government turns its attention elsewhere."
Since the early years of this century, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has helped tens of thousands of people whose lives seemed devoid of hope. The New York Times pays the expenses of the Neediest Cases campaign, so all contributions are given directly to seven charities. This year's appeal, the 81st, ends on Feb. 28.
In her letter to the fund that she enclosed with a $300 check, Joan Skurnik of Manhattan posed a question: "Dare we hope things will be better next year?"
"I wish I could do more -- New York has been good to me and you have been good to New Yorkers," she wrote. "However, as this century closes, more people than ever are in need. Something has gone terribly wrong with our social contract."
And Harriette A. Simons of Manhattan sent $100, explaining that she was giving to the Neediest Cases for the first time because she was upset by the growing misery in the United States and around the world.
"Perhaps the pictures and stories from Somalia and Bosnia sharpened and prodded my conscience," she wrote. "Suddenly I feel personally involved."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Fears of Conflict Lift Dollar; Gold Prices Also Move Up

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed mostly higher yesterday in busy currency trading as political instability heated up around the world.
Gold prices also settled mostly higher. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $329.20 an ounce, up 50 cents from Thursday. The Republic National Bank said gold added 35 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $329.25. 
 The dollar advanced overnight in Europe, setting the stage for a strong opening when trading shifted to domestic markets. Analysts said the dollar was in demand again as a "safe haven" currency, as it often is in times of world turmoil.
Iraq rejected a Western ultimatum that it remove missiles from southern Iraq and said any allied attack would provoke a counterattack.
And in Yugoslavia, Serbian gunmen killed the Deputy Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina at a roadblock in Sarajevo.
"There are not a lot of reasons to sell the dollar," said Frank Pusateri, a vice president of the Bank of Boston. "There is still concern over Iraq and the Bosnian minister."
 
 
A Brief Selloff
 The dollar sold off briefly after a report on December unemployment. The Labor Department said the jobless rate held at 7.3 percent last month. Currency traders focused on the gain of 64,000 jobs, which was well below analysts' expectations of gains ranging from 100,000 to 120,000.
Still, Mr. Pusateri noted that most other world economies were perceived as being "in worse shape than we are," and the dollar recovered to close at its highs for the day.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to close at 125.42 Japanese yen, from 125.09 yen at the Thursday close. Later in London, it fell to 124.25 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 125.35 yen, up from 125.15 on Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.5407, from $1.5345 late Thursday. In New York, it cost $1.5320 to buy 1, more expensive than $1.5315 on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with the late Thursday rates, included: 1.6465 German marks, up from 1.6365; 1.5010 Swiss francs, up from 1.4945; 5.6020 French francs, up from 5.5635; 1,508.25 Italian lire, down from 1.510.00, and 1.2825 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2801.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with the late Thursday rates, included: 1.6375 German marks, unchanged; 1.4940 Swiss francs, down from 1.4947; 5.5715 French francs, up from 5.5630; 1.8405 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8390; 1,497 Italian lire, down from 1,513, and 1.2820 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2795.

HEADLINE: Opening Up Japanese Politics

 BODY:
After 36 years of one-party dominance, Japan appears headed toward competitive politics. The leading faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party has shattered, pointing the way to a realignment that could eventually bring an American-style two-party system. For a time, political infighting could make it harder for Tokyo to deliver on diplomatic deals. In the longer run, democratic competition would be good for Japan, and the U.S.
Ichiro Ozawa, Japan's most formidable younger politician and its most fiercely ambitious, forced the split. After building his career as the protege of Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced "godfather" of Japanese factional politics, Mr. Ozawa has now cleverly, if cynically, reinvented himself as the champion of political reform. 
 That new image should help him in the wake of the big political corruption scandals that have sparked anger in a usually complacent electorate. But it should also help the reform cause; major changes rarely happen in Japan without powerful sponsors.
Mr. Ozawa is still working out the details of his reform agenda. The most effective steps would be strictly enforced limits on political contributions, comprehensive disclosure requirements and a long-overdue reapportionment of parliamentary seats to reflect urbanization.
At present, large secret contributions are made with an eye to steering government business toward the contributors, often at the expense of foreign competitors. The rural bias in Parliament gives extra weight to protectionist rice growers and other farmers. This comes at the expense of urban consumers, who prefer more competitive retail prices and more government spending on social services. They also tend to be Japan's most internationally minded citizens.
The rise of a more competitive politics is likely to give ordinary Japanese greater influence in public affairs. By making himself their champion, Mr. Ozawa can accelerate this process.
One-party rule has guided Japan through decades of economic success. But that success has now pushed a new international and social agenda to the fore, an agenda that would benefit mightily from political competition and anti-corruption reforms.
As different as the U.S. and Japanese political systems are, Americans in 1993 can readily empathize with the disgust ordinary Japanese feel toward "money politics" and their desire for constructive change.

HEADLINE: In Bad Times, U.S. Should Assist States More

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Tax That Rides the Tides" (Op-Ed, Dec. 22), Ralph Bradburd's proposal for a permanent Federal income tax surcharge that automatically varies inversely with the unemployment rate is a sensible way to attack the deficit problem and the need for short-term economic stimulus. It is one of those long-term structural reforms that, once enacted, would make most people wonder why it had not been done years earlier. 
 A complement to this surcharge would be a permanent program of Federal countercyclical aid to state and local governments, similar to one we had in the late 1970's. As in that program, the total the Federal Government provides each year would depend on how bad economic conditions are nationally, with the program winding down as the economy recovers. Like the earlier program, the per capita amount each state received should depend on its unemployment rate, with a threshold rate below which a state receives nothing.
Unlike the Federal Government, state governments respond strongly to recession, but in ways that make it worse: they cut back spending and increase taxes, to balance budgets thrown into deep deficit by recession. Federal assistance not tied to any specific type of spending would be immediately effective in stopping such recession-deepening actions by the states. After all, cutting programs and raising taxes are not popular things to do. Governors and legislators would love to stop doing them.
Like the income tax surcharge, this program combines short-term stimulus and a long-term deficit reduction strategy. Both need to be permanent and automatic to realize their promise.

HEADLINE: German Law Won't End Immigration Problems

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Germany Closes the Gate" (editorial, Dec. 9) you criticize the accord reached by Germany's major parties severely to limit entry of foreigners seeking to escape persecution or economic hardships in their countries. Unfortunately, this policy, once enacted into law in 1993, will not solve the problems of illegal immigration, which will increase sharply, and of right-wing backlash. 
 True, Germany cannot absorb all who want to better their economic conditions, but an immigration policy based on a quota system, as stipulated in bills introduced in the Parliament this year by the Alternative '90 and Greens deputies, would be a partial solution. Those bills would integrate foreigners into German society, granting them more civil rights after five years of residence and German citizenship for children of foreign parents born on German soil.
Unfortunately, most Government deputies are opposed to a quota system based on the concept that Germany should be a country of immigration; thus it is unlikely this proposal will be implemented soon.
There is hope, however, that citizenship will be granted to foreigners more easily. You are not correct in saying that German citizenship is denied to a Turkish guest worker who has lived in Germany for 30 years. Any foreigner who has resided in Germany for 15 years (and spouse and children for less time) can apply for citizenship before January 1996, but may not have dual citizenship. Any foreigner younger than 23 is entitled to apply for citizenship after eight years' residence, including six years' attendance at a German school. The procedure, however, is complex, time-consuming and costly.
Critics of limited immigration say convincingly that national solutions to migration problems will not work without international efforts to remove the causes of large-scale movement of poor people to wealthier countries. For the German Government and other West European governments to try to buttress a Fortress Europe policy will fail as long as the gap widens between the first world (United States, Canada, Western Europe) on one side and the second world (former Communist bloc states) and third world (most African, Asian and Latin American states) on the other.
First world states must share more of their wealth with poorer states in order to slow down the exodus of people. An international social charter is needed that would provide minimum protection for workers and families in their home countries on a global scale. Finally, wealthy states must adopt foreign policies that would assist, rather than harm, third world states.

HEADLINE: Shock in a Land of Lifetime Jobs: 35 Managers Dismissed in Japan

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 8

 BODY:
The unthinkable has happened in Japan, and it has touched a nerve in the ranks of the nation's middle managers.
A well-known maker of audio and video equipment, Pioneer Electronic, conceded today that it was essentially firing 35 middle managers, a candid admission that Japanese companies have begun to violate their long-cherished policies of lifetime employment. 
 Such a move would barely attract notice in the United States, where thousands of employees are sometimes given pink slips in a day. But in Japan, the commitment to keeping people employed through good times and bad is a pillar of a management system in which Japanese workers remain highly dedicated to their companies. And the move, in the midst of a severe economic slump, portends significant changes in the Japanese corporate culture.
 
 
'It Has Come to This'
 "My first reaction, honestly, was, 'My God, it has come to this,' " an automobile executive said. But he quickly added, "If the current slump continues for another year or two, a lot of companies will be doing the same thing."
Pioneer, a Tokyo-based maker of car stereos, laser-disk players and other other electronics gear, did not actually fire the employees outright, a spokesman said. Rather, it told the managers in late December that they would have until the end of January to retire.
If the managers, all in their 50's, did retire, they would receive a hefty bonus. If they didn't, they would eventually be dismissed. "This is actually, practically, a dismissal," the spokesman, Yojiro Orita, said.
Takeo Naruse, deputy general manager of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, a lobbying group, called the Pioneer move "shock therapy." He said most other companies would not resort to such drastic actions, which could hurt company morale. Still, he said, "Gradually, Japanese employment practices are changing."
To be sure, lifetime employment has never been universal. Small and medium-sized companies, which often supply components to large companies, frequently lay off workers and act as a buffer to help the big companies maintain full employment. And even at large corporations, the job guarantee does not apply to legions of part-time or temporary workers. But in the case of Pioneer, a leading electronics company, the affected managers are full-time employees.
Some experts said Pioneer's approach was a slightly stricter version of what was now happening quietly in many businesses, with managers being asked to retire for the good of the companies. The procedure is called "kata tataki," or a tap on the shoulder. Most employees accept the offer, although they usually have the option of declining if they are willing to accept lower pay or a lesser job.
Many employers insist that they are not dismissing workers, but the boundary between forced resignations and voluntary departures is becoming very narrow. "Most companies have been terminating middle managers already for a long time," said Kazunori Morishita, president of Bright Career, a firm that helps workers find new jobs. "But they don't say, 'If you don't agree, you will be fired.' "
Many economists have questioned how much longer Japanese companies can continue their practice of lifetime employment in the face of the severe economic slump. During the speculative "bubble economy" of the late 1980's, companies actively hired, believing the economy would keep expanding. Now that the economy has slowed, many employees are no longer necessary.
 
Redundant Workers
 Some economic research organizations estimate that about 1 million employees in Japanese companies, out of the nation's total employment of about 65 million, are redundant. This underemployment, which drags down corporate earnings, is in some sense a bigger problem than unemployment, which is still a low 2.3 percent.
So far, many companies have announced plans to cut thousands of employees in the next few years. But they insist they will do that by reducing hiring, offering voluntary retirements or transferring employees to other divisions or to subsidiaries.
Many companies bend over backward to avoid layoffs -- by paying people to stay home, for example. Or a steel company with excess employees might lend them to an auto company with a shortage of workers.
 
Fears of Worker Shortage
 Part of the resolve to hang on to employees stems from fear that because of Japan's low birth rates, the severe worker shortage that plagued the nation until recently will reoccur when the economy recovers.
Another aspect of Japanese management that is changing is the seniority system, in which promotions and salaries tend to rise with the length of service. That has weighed down companies with many middle-aged managers with high salaries but little opportunity to advance. Now, some leading companies like Honda and Fujitsu are moving toward a system in which pay is based on merit, at least for top managers.
"In the old, traditional system, you work long and are eventually promoted to manager," said Mr. Orita, the Pioneer spokesman. "That system can no longer work because we're moving into a severe economic situation. So we're forced to look at each manager's achievements."
Mr. Orita said the 35 employees, whose identities were being kept secret even in the company, were chosen because they were not performing up to par. Because of their seniority, many have the rank and salary of a section chief but have no one reporting to them.
 
Morale May Suffer
 Some outsiders questioned the move, saying that eliminating 35 employees out of more than 1,000 managers saves Pioneer barely any money and will hurt morale. While its profits are dropping, Pioneer is still making money, unlike many other consumer electronics companies.
A few months ago, the president of TDK, a manufacturer of magnetic tapes, proposed paying about 50 older managers 90 percent of their salaries if they would stay home until they reached retirement age. But the employees revolted, forcing the president to rescind the plan.
Mr. Orita said that when Pioneer employees learned about the forced retirements from newspapers or television -- the company did not announce them internally -- some managers were shocked and feared they would be the next to get the tap on the shoulder. But, he said, the move could raise the morale of younger executives who resent having promotions blocked by older managers who do not work as hard.
As he emerged from work today at the company's headquarters, one manager in his 30's said the action was "drastic" and would hurt morale. Another merely shrugged. "It's strict," he said, "but it's unavoidable."

HEADLINE: College Curriculums Shaken to the Core

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3D

 BODY:
EVER SINCE Stanford University overhauled its curriculum in 1988 from a rigid core of courses dealing with Western civilization to one that includes few required courses and a larger, more varied menu of subjects on women and minorities from which students can choose, life hasn't been the same at the nation's colleges and universities.
College core curriculums, those courses that supposedly represent the core of learning that each institution wants to instill in its graduates, are undergoing a reformation. The process is leaving the intellectual underpinnings of some institutions teetering and others firmly set upon a new educational path. 
 The major battle in this revolution pits those who believe the core should be based on the Western canon against those who support a broader, multicultural base rich in the voices of women, minorities and foreign cultures. But an examination of curriculum revisions nationwide indicates that while this struggle draws the passion and attention, it is a lesser issue whose heat masks the main question: whether a particular American college or university needs a core curriculum, and if so, what purpose it should serve.
It is a challenge that few institutions are consciously undertaking. But whether by design or default, a clear trend in core curriculums is emerging: American colleges and universities are moving away from an emphasis on content -- requiring all students to take specific courses in which they will study the same texts -- and toward an emphasis on intellectual processes: requiring students to sample certain subjects, within which they can take any courses as long as they are taught to think critically and analytically.
According to a survey by the American Council on Education, an association of 1,700 public and private colleges and universities, the percentage of its members that maintained core curriculums in the spring of 1992 was 80 percent, down from 82 percent in 1987. But Clifton Conrad, a professor of higher education at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said the slight drop over the last five years masks great turmoil among colleges. "Literally hundreds of them are revising their curriculums," Professor Conrad said.
O. T. Hargrave, associate dean for student academic affairs at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, which revised its curriculum this academic year, agrees that "There is across the country a lot of revision going on." At S.M.U., Mr. Hargrave said, curriculum revisions "focus more on teaching critical analysis rather than making sure we have covered all the basic contents."
However, according to Professor Conrad, who has been following the core curriculum debate closely: "People think it's just an issue about whose voices we hear, but it's much more profound. There are some essential questions we should be asking."
Students of higher education reform say many institutions are avoiding the task. Most, they say, are distracted by the debate over Western versus multicultural curriculums because it is an emotional one, defined by issues of race and gender. Among faculty members, too, there is some resistance to change because "the university is the most conservative of all our social institutions," said Professor Conrad.
"And, frankly," he added, "anytime anyone has certain control or privileges they are unwilling to give up their power."
There are questions of cost, too: New materials often must be purchased and new professors hired to teach the new courses.
As a result, revised curriculums often are politicized by the fights over Western versus non-Western thought and the relative importance of each department or subject, and without any obvious educational focus, critics say. Indeed, many students earn bachelor's degrees without knowledge of "basic landmarks of history and thought," wrote Lynne V. Cheney, chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, in a 1989 report, "50 Hours." The report urged institutions of higher learning to revise curriculums so that undergraduates study a more cohesive, focused curriculum, including Western thought, math, science and social science.
The endowment backed its complaints with evidence: 25 percent of 700 college seniors surveyed in 1989, for example, did not know that Columbus landed in the Western Hemisphere before 1500, according to a Gallup poll released with the endowment's study. And most students surveyed could not identify Magna Carta. "Many American colleges and universities fail to provide enough structure in curriculums," the Endowment report concluded.
SOME STUDENTS concur, saying they feel as if they are in a supermarket making disparate selections that find them at the checkout counter without the makings of a complete, intellectually nutritious meal and graduating without a sense of what they know. Other students have avoided institutions with cafeteria-style curriculums.
When Jeff A. Zanarini graduated from high school in Omaha, Neb., three years ago, for example, he visited Stanford. He was turned off, he said, by the smorgasbord approach to curriculum. "Universities like Stanford have really gone too far," said Mr. Zanarini, now a junior with a double major in economics and French at Southern Methodist University, whose curriculum is largely based on the Western canon and requires students to take one multicultural course. "Every student expects some non-Western course; I feel I'm getting the right dose at S.M.U."
For administrators and faculty who may feel less sure, the Association of American Colleges last month released a 127-page book, "Core Curriculum and Cultural Pluralism: A Guide for Campus Planners," by Betty Schmitz, director of the Curriculum Transformation Project at the University of Washington.
Meanwhile, to fill the vacuum that has resulted from the battle over core curriculums, individual schools and departments in which students major are producing increasingly structured curriculum requirements of their own. The purpose of these requirements -- to equip graduates for the job market -- stands in marked contrast to the purpose of their progenitors.
Columbia University instituted the grandfather of core curriculums in 1919, a year after the end of World War I. Columbia took war issues as a model for an innovative course called "Contemporary Civilization." The idea won faculty support by promising to provide students with a common background of ideas and by spanning compartmentalized disciplines. But the course also had an ideological mission: "Contemporary Civilization" would inoculate young people against Bolshevism and other subversive doctrines. One dean said it would produce students "who shall be safe for democracy."
That purpose rarely obtains on today's college campuses. Rather, new core curriculums, where instituted, must be geared to a world that has experienced an information explosion, the globalization of national economies and a radically changing job market.
There are many ways to design core curriculums that will achieve these new ends. At some institutions, the debate comes down to using the Western canon or a multicultural curriculum as stepping stones to critical thinking. Western core advocates and universities that embrace the "Great Books" -- disparagingly referred to by some as works by Dead White European Males, or DWEM -- argue that certain universal truths speak to all generations of students. This is a Western culture, they say, and all students should understand its underpinnings.
Supporters of multicultural curriculums say they recognize that knowledge is neither finite nor static. This nation, they maintain, is a multicultural society whose constituents bring strength and vigor to college studies. Core curriculums should include these new voices, proponents say, and new ways to teach students how to approach learning and thinking.
At other institutions the debate seems to be between structuralists, who advocate a rigid set of courses required of all students, and advocates of choice, who see little merit in all students studying the same materials. At St. John's College in Annapolis, Md., for instance, the curriculum is based on the Western core, with no apologies. "We are supplying students with the common and the universal root of their present conditions," said Eva T. H. Brann, dean of the college. And works by Asian or African-American women writers are "not central to the tradition."
"They say everyone should read the same thing," said Henry Rosovsky, the architect of Harvard University's core curriculum, disparaging the structuralists as politically motivated. "Our curriculum offers choice."
Harvard's core was revamped in 1978, well before Stanford triggered the current debate, but because of Harvard's stature it remains a lightning rod in the curriculum wars. The Harvard core, say critics, is too broad and poorly focused. "It is not a core," said William J. Bennett, the United States Secretary of Education from 1985 to 1988 and now a fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative research institution. Mr. Bennett derisively called Harvard's curriculum "core light," and added: "The Harvard core is essentially a group of professorial idiosyncrasies elevated to the status of a seeming coherent core."
Not so, responds Mr. Rosovsky, who chronicled some of the debate in his book "The University: An Owner's Manual" (Norton, 1990). Harvard students must take 16 courses across a spectrum of 10 academic areas including historical studies, literature and arts, social analysis, science and moral reasoning.
Within these areas, students are offered so many choices that they could graduate without ever taking a course in Western civilization. "Can one -- as has often been asked -- graduate from Harvard without reading Shakespeare?" Mr. Rosovsky writes. "Yes, but one cannot get a degree without reading literary classics in a critical and analytical way under the guidance of a specialist."
 
'At Harvard, We Have Chosen One Way'
 "There is no one way to define an educated person," Mr. Rosovsky added in an interview. "The requirements are aimed at broadening someone's intellectual perspective. At Harvard, we have chosen one way. I am not saying it is the only way."
Scholars at the University of California at Berkeley agree. "Knowledge comes in a lot of different ways, and the strength of a larger university is its ability to offer intellectual diversity," said Arnold L. Lieman, chairman of the psychology department.
At Berkeley, for instance, the 14 colleges and schools that constitute the university design their own curriculums and maintain their own requirements. Two courses are required of all students: "American Cultures" and basic English. Besides those, students fill their plates with a dizzying array of requirements for their majors.
There have been few cries of protest from students on campus, many of whom say they welcome the choice. "U.C. Berkeley offers enough in terms of selection," said Nick Perlmuter, a junior from Huntington Beach, Calif., majoring in environmental science. Mr. Perlmuter said he didn't feel cheated by the lack of other required courses because "what they are training us to do is go out and find the information, because it's already there, and analyze it."
Unlike many other universities, Boise State University in Idaho is asking hard questions about curriculum. The faculty is considering revisions that take a more measured approach, one that balances the Western canon with non-Western courses and that teaches all courses in a way that helps students think and analyze information in different ways. "A core curriculum should reflect certain common experiences or knowledge that most undergraduates should be exposed to," said Daryl E. Jones, interim executive vice president. "It is one of the things that binds us all together."
Currently Boise State maintains a 51-credit core curriculum, which requires students to take six credits of English composition and pass a writing exam, and 12 credits each of required courses in three areas: arts and humanities, social sciences, and natural science and mathematics. They are also required to take nine more elective credits in those three areas.
But as Boise State ponders revisions, "the key issue is how that relates to other cultures and other experiences and fits in the overall education of a student," Mr. Jones said. "We haven't resolved all the issues ourselves."

HEADLINE: A Nation of Readers Dumps Its Writers

BYLINE: By Katie Hafner; Katie Hafner is at work on a book about the consequences of German reunification.

 BODY:
In the Summer of 1990, barely six months after the Berlin wall fell, residents of Kommlitz, a small village near Leipzig in southeastern Germany, made a bizarre discovery. Their local garbage dump had been turned into a mountain of books. It looked as if a city library had been turned upside down and had its contents shaken out. It was a curiously arbitrary collection. Communist tracts were discarded along with German classics; Lenin's "State and Revolution" lay next to the works of Tolstoy. But most of the books were by East Germany's most celebrated fiction writers: Christa Wolf, Stefan Heym, Hermann Kant and Anna Seghers.
As it turned out, the main East German book distributor had simply dumped some 10 million volumes, emptying its warehouse to make way for a soft-drink repository. After people had picked through the books, taking what they wanted, the rest were buried in a huge pit. 
 East Germans threw away a lot of things after the wall came down. They abandoned their plastic two-stroke Trabants in favor of sturdy, speedy Volkswagen Golfs. They discarded their ill-cut blue jeans made of synthetic fiber and bought Levi's instead. When kiwis, avocados and tomatoes arrived in the stores, they stopped buying the tiresome native-grown apples and cabbage they had suffered for 40 years. And why not?
But the rejection of their own authors' books was the rejection of a collective soul. The collapse of Communist East Germany has taken its writers with it. Once among that nation's most elite and privileged citizens, they have suffered a summary fall from grace. Once heroes, they are now being accused of timidity and are falling into discredit. Once looked to for the truth, they are now mistrusted and, still worse, ignored.
East Germany was called the Nation of Readers. Its citizens adored their authors. Writers were the Oprah Winfreys and Phil Donahues of the nation, the ones to whom people turned for what the Germans call Lebenshilfe, or life help, the ones designated to answer the question: How do you get by in an authoritarian regime? It was in the pages of East German novels that such topics as alcoholism, homosexuality and abortion were first broached. Public readings were always standing room only, and often they turned into mass public confessionals. It was at readings, says Therese Hornigk, a literary historian in Eastern Berlin, that people realized they weren't alone. "People went to readings to experience solidarity and build up self-confidence," she says.
Christa Wolf, in particular, East Germany's most famous writer, was a kind of Mother Confessor. Wolf's cathartic, intensely personal and multilayered prose inspired thousands of people to write to her about their own lives. She employed a secretary just to help her answer the dozens of letters she received every day.
Prominent writers enjoyed commensurately privileged lives. They were free to travel to Western countries for lectures and readings. They lived in large apartments and houses in exclusive neighborhoods in East Berlin, and drove Western cars. Many of them had country homes as well. Some even kept bank accounts in Switzerland. When Wolf traveled, she was a diplomat-celebrity.
Even writers with mediocre talent could find a publisher and make a good living -- if they espoused the party line. As a rule, books in East Germany enjoyed enormous first printings by Western standards -- and still there was a shortage. East Germans waited for new works from Christa Wolf, Christoph Hein and Stefan Heym the way they waited for the oranges that were fleetingly available around Christmas. A first printing of 500,000 wasn't unusual for those writers, and their books would sell out within days. A volume of poetry would typically have a first print run of 20,000 copies, while in the West a first printing of 2,000 for a book of poetry is considered large. And, curiously enough, books were hoarded the way sugar and coffee were, just in the event of lean times. The central distributor in Leipzig hoarded millions of books, which is how it ended up with so many after the wall fell.
When East Germany became a nation in 1949, its writers were idealistic Socialists. Many of them moved there from the West because they believed that they were taking part in building the better of the two postwar Germanys. Christa Wolf and others participated in a writer-worker movement in the late 50's and early 60's, in which writers were encouraged to work in factories and then describe their experiences. With few exceptions, East German literature was characterized by its intensity and earnestness, by a culture of sacrifice and suffering -- one of Christa Wolf's favorite settings is a hospital. It was Socialist realism mixed with utopian dreaming. Protagonists might have flirted with the idea of going West, but the real heroes rejected emigration in the end.
Hermann Kant's 1965 novel, "The Auditorium," is a classic example. It is the story of an East German journalist's visit to his hometown in a frightening and disquieting West Germany. The journalist's brief trip turns into a personal confrontation with a divided Germany, and the lesson Kant imparts is a common one in East German fiction: the reactionary Western state is to be rejected in favor of the "new" Socialist one. "The Auditorium" was required reading in East German schools and there were one million copies in print.
In return for the adulation they bestowed, readers got a kind of intellectual balm. The books they took refuge in might have occasionally ruffled the state, but they seldom questioned the legitimacy of one-party rule. East German literature served to reinforce the idea of Communism, if not exactly the reality of it. And in return for its largess, the Communist state got a body of literature that inadvertently sustained rather than exposed the hard-edged, brutal reality of a dictatorship.
Morally, writers in East Germany lived a kind of double life. Their brand of dissidence was far more cautious than the radical dissidence of Vaclav Havel in Czechoslovakia and Gyorgy Konrad in Hungary. East German writers engaged in a constant balancing act, at once adherents to the "Project" of Socialism and purveyors of a truth that couldn't be found in East German newspapers. In her 1987 novel, "Accident/A Day's News," for example, Wolf wrote critically of the Chernobyl nuclear accident, after official East German press reports had minimized the event.
As in other East Bloc countries, in East Germany there was a culture of artistic allusion and linguistic evasion. Censors worked full-time to catch double- and triple-entendres. When the East German Government refused to print a book, authors occasionally published the book in West Germany. The Communist regime didn't discourage the practice, because it pocketed the hard currency. Writers who went too far in the eyes of the regime, like Gunter Kunert and Rainer Kunze, were simply exported to West Germany.
But a true literature of dissent like the Samizdat underground literature in the Soviet Union never appeared in East Germany. Writers drew much of their sustenance from the rejection of their other half, West Germany, as a land of crass consumerism still run by fascists. This bred a peculiarly weak tradition of defiance. "Much more than in other East Bloc countries, writers were very involved in the Project of Socialism," says Peter Schneider, a writer from Western Berlin. "This created a mental block, a fixation not to become West Germany. In thousands of pages of literature in East Germany, you never find the simple demand for democracy. In Czechoslovakia, on the other hand, you wouldn't meet a single serious writer after 1968 who would say, 'I'm still a Communist.' "
Although they could have left for the West, writers like Christa Wolf felt obligated to stay, especially during the period of mass emigration in 1961 just before the wall went up. Wolf received hundreds of letters from readers imploring her not to leave. "People needed me," she says. "People needed something to give them strength." Besides, Wolf says: "I couldn't have written the books I wrote anywhere else. There was nothing that interested me more than the country, its people and the conflict situation there."
Even after the wall fell in November 1989 and the nation was crumbling around them, East German intellectuals who had stayed held fast to the idea of a Third Way: Socialism with a human face. Deaf to their fellow citizens' demands for Western goods and hard currency, intellectuals instead issued declarations and manifestoes imploring East Germans to stay and help reform Socialism.
There were some who didn't stay. Through the years, East Germany lost many of its most talented and popular stars to the West. Some, like the dissident poet and songwriter Wolf Biermann, were forced to leave. After holding a concert in Cologne in late 1976, during which he sang songs with particularly pointed antigovernment lyrics, Biermann, a cross between Bob Dylan and Andrei Sakharov, was told by the East German authorities not to return. Biermann's expulsion set off a protest among his fellow writers, several of whom eventually followed him to West Germany.
For their part, West German writers were well aware of the effect their country's presence had on East German writers. The two groups shared a history and a language, but they had little in common as writers. Martin Walser, one of West Germany's most prolific novelists, says he felt more comfortable talking with writers from England and France than from East Germany. Encounters with Eastern colleagues were awkward because the writers all had a whiff of collusion about them. "It always made conversations very artificially polite," Walser recalls. "Hermann Kant was always very nice but I was never sure about his background."
Writers from the two halves of Germany still maintain separate branches of PEN, the writers' organization, and the question of whether they should merge is a topic of heavy debate. Writers from the former West Germany are reluctant to sit in the same room with writers from the former East Germany, and the Western PEN group is insisting that certain Communist members of the Eastern branch leave the organization before the two branches unite. Those who left East Germany before late 1989 are even more self-righteous. Monika Maron, an outspoken writer who has embraced the West wholeheartedly since leaving East Germany five years ago, says she can't imagine that the two PEN's will someday merge. "We're just waiting for them all to die out," she says of those in the Eastern branch.
Today, the question of who stayed and who left is a topic discussed with a lingering moral defensiveness. Maron left East Germany after she was unable to publish her first novel, "Flight of Ashes," there. "Flight of Ashes" is the story of an East German journalist and the unpleasant consequences she faces after writing the truth about the environmental conditions in and around the town of Bitterfeld. For years, East Germany's chemical industries had saturated the Bitterfeld surround with hazardous wastes, making it one of the most polluted spots in Europe. For anyone who traveled to within a few miles of the area, the filthy air and blackened rivers were impossible to overlook. After the East German authorities refused to print the book, Maron had it published in West Germany in 1981, then finally left seven years later.
Maron has taken on the style and biting humor that still distinguish many self-assured Western Germans from their Eastern counterparts. Her most recent novel appeared in 1991 to excellent reviews, and she has the air of someone satisfied to know that she was right after all, that the Christa Wolfs of the world were wrong. She moved to Hamburg nearly five years ago but keeps an apartment in Pankow, a quiet tree-lined neighborhood in Eastern Berlin where Wolf and other members of the East German literary set still live. But Maron is uncomfortable there; chance encounters with the writers who stayed are always awkward, and she is looking for an apartment in Western Berlin. "It's unbelievable to me that people who think for a living didn't see what a pile of filth and muck the entire country was," Maron says.
A FORM OF LITERARY AMNESIA HAS struck citizens in the erstwhile Nation of Readers. Ask people in Eastern Germany whether they read certain authors from the German Democratic Republic and they'll give a look of puzzlement mixed with guilt and shake their heads, as if the names are vaguely familiar, but they can't recall having read the books. If they did read them, they can't recall having liked them.
One of the most poignant scenes illustrating the precipitous fall of East German writers came at the annual Frankfurt Book Fair in October. While thousands of publishers and book agents from around the world were in deal-signing overdrive and dozens of authors read from their works, Hermann Kant read from his recently published memoir.
Four years ago, a public reading by Kant would have drawn hundreds. But his Frankfurt appearance was relegated to a local youth hostel on the fringes of the book fair's main action. The audience was composed of a group of fellow travelers. In an embarrassing development for Kant, it had just been disclosed that for all the years he presided over the powerful East German writers' union he had been an informant for the Stasi, the East German secret police.
"It was really very sad," says Frank Schirrmacher, the literary editor of the influential Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Germany's largest national daily newspaper, who attended Kant's reading. "This is where the whole story of East German literature ended, in the basement of a youth hostel in Frankfurt." As a bitter footnote, Schirrmacher adds that the very movement that started in that city in the 1920's with the founding of the Marxist-oriented Frankfurt Institute has been reduced to a roomful of depressed and broken old men with heart ailments. "Kant's reading was a kind of symbolic last encounter with the whole idea of Communist cultural understanding," says Schirrmacher.
Writers don't quite belong in the gallery of villains alongside Erich Honecker, the former East German leader who is now on trial in Berlin, or Erich Mielke, the former head of the Stasi, who is on trial for murder. But their ambiguous role has caused readers in the former East Germany to recoil from the literature that once helped them through the day; it sparked attacks from a generation of brash young critics and brought about a silence among the writers themselves.
After an initial flurry of essays once the wall came down, and a handful of memoirs, writers from the former East Germany stopped producing. The fall of Communism should have liberated writers -- instead it crippled them and exposed them to the world of harsh criticism. It pointed up the difference between writers in the West, who write because they believe they have something to say, and writers in the East, who wrote because their readers needed them to say something.
Schirrmacher started the onslaught in 1990, with an unprecedented attack on Christa Wolf. For years rumored to be on the short list for the Nobel Prize, Wolf had gained a worldwide reputation. Her subtly critical fiction and her readiness to take on contemporary German history made her a hero both to East German readers and West German critics. Through the years, the 63-year-old novelist's writing, translated into 27 languages, has engendered a voluminous body of secondary literature. She has a particularly large following among American feminists.
Shortly after the Berlin wall fell, Wolf published a 100-page book titled "What Remains," a novella she had written a decade earlier and kept in a desk drawer. The book is based on a period she spent under Stasi surveillance in the late 1970's after she protested the expulsion of Wolf Biermann.
As soon as Christa Wolf's book appeared in the spring of 1990, Schirrmacher did the unthinkable. With brazen disrespect, Schirrmacher, then 33, attacked older critics for having perpetuated the myth of an East German literature of dissent, and he attacked Wolf herself for having lacked the courage to publish the book 10 years earlier. If she had done so, Schirrmacher argued, she could have forced into public a discussion of the Stasi -- a topic conspicuously absent from East German literature -- much earlier. She claimed to be complaining about the Stasi, but she waited until it was safe to do it. She claimed to be a victim but was in fact a tacit collaborator.
Sensitive and unaccustomed to such harsh treatment, Wolf largely withdrew from public view. For the next two years, she declined invitations to appear at conferences and colloquia. Last September she went to Santa Monica, Calif., to begin a nine-month stay as a visiting scholar at the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities. One of her conditions in accepting the invitation was that she be shielded from the press.
German literary critics have described Wolf's decision to leave Germany as a form of self-imposed exile, but she says she was simply looking for a way to get some work done. Life on the California shoreline appears to have had its effect on the intense Wolf. She's living close to the beach and has seen an acupuncturist for pain in her hip. More significantly, she is re-emerging as an intellectual voice. Last year, she gave two readings in New York, and two of her books are coming out this spring in English translation. In a recent telephone interview, she sounded positively mellow.
Wolf's California sojourn has also given her the time and distance she needs to reflect on her once and future role in German literature. She dismisses Schirrmacher's attack on her intellectual integrity as "arrogant nonsense." But in a way he was right. Wolf's exalted position as a virtual State Poet would have protected her from ugly consequences. If the East German authorities had refused to print her novella, she could have done what many of her colleagues and even she had done in the past -- published it in West Germany. "There could have been a real explosion," says Schirrmacher. Then he went a step further. While he was at it, he decided to pose some larger questions that no West German critic had yet dared ask. Were East Germany's biggest talents independent thinkers or panderers to the Communist regime? Were they the conscience of their nation or cowardly collaborators in the failed experiment of East Germany?
Sadly, they were a little bit of all these things. But what Schirrmacher and others have ignored is that they were also the most reliable chroniclers of a corner of history that the world is all too eager to forget.
EAST GERMAN WRITERS WHO counted on a built-in audience must grapple now with the vagaries of a fickle reading public; they must compete, in essence, with Stephen King. Many publishing houses in the former East Germany have folded or been bought out by Western firms and sharply reduced their lists, leaving hundreds of writers without a publisher at all. Many are now demanding unemployment benefits from the German Government.
People in Eastern Germany need a new kind of "life help" now. In the Literature Store halfway down a busy pedestrian mall in Potsdam near Berlin, customers pass by the shelf of serious literature at the door; barely stop to leaf through any number of tomes analyzing the fall of East Germany; ignore translations of Charles Bukowski and Richard Ford, and head for a table near the cash register. It is stacked with books offering tax advice, insurance primers, travel guides and language texts. When Eastern Germans do spend money on books, these are the books they buy.
Part of the reason people have stopped buying books is that they are no longer so affordable. The average price of a hard-cover book in East Germany was $4. Today it is $30, or the equivalent of a month's rent in the former East Germany. One influential German publisher says that although former East Germans account for one-fifth of the overall population in Germany today, they buy less than 2 percent of all books sold.
It's depressing to be irrelevant all of a sudden. Since the wall fell, fewer than a dozen copies of Kant's "Auditorium" have been sold. Kant's rambling house next to a lake on the outskirts of Berlin is being reclaimed by its Western owners and, given the recent news of his Stasi connections, he is uncertain of his future.
The chasm between writers and their public in the former East Germany has also taken some grotesque turns. The life of 79-year-old Stefan Heym was known to every East German schoolchild. Heym, a Jew, fled Hitler and fought in the United States Army during World War II, then moved to East Germany in 1952 out of a commitment to Socialism. He went on to become one of East Germany's most prolific and privileged writers. When he wrote books that weren't to the East German Government's liking, he simply had them published in the West.
A prickly personality, Heym has the air of someone who's seen it all. But even Heym was rattled by what happened to him last summer. He was sitting in a restaurant when a stranger, smiling politely, approached his table, then punched him in the face. "He came up to me and I thought I knew him. I thought he'd read my books," Heym recalls. "Instead he wanted to smash my skull." Heym's assailant turned out to be a former East German who had long since emigrated to the United States and was apparently intent on blaming Heym personally for the East Germans' 40 years of suffering under Communism. A few weeks later he got a note from another stranger calling him a "Commie Jewish swine."
ONCE THE Eastern Germans have learned how to file their taxes and buy their car insurance, once they have seen Miami and read a few airport novels, they might be ready to start reading serious literature again.
And what they find might surprise them.
Since the wall fell, a new generation of writers has emerged, and it is getting a lot of attention. These writers are twenty- and thirtysomething, and they are far more taken with Hemingway and Faulkner and Austrian Surrealists than they ever were with Christa Wolf or Stefan Heym. Theirs is a generation saved, perhaps, by its lack of investment in East-West politics. In the same way that it took someone of Schirrmacher's youth to attack a writer twice his age, it could take a new generation of writers to produce the next burst of literature in the former East Germany.
Durs Grunbein, outgoing and self-possessed, smokes a long slender cigar of Brazilian tobacco and sips Glenlivet whisky in the Cafe Einstein, a Viennese-style coffeehouse in Berlin that Berliners might describe as shicki-micki, a bit too chic for comfort. The 30-year-old poet is a rising star. His powerfully graphic poems have made him a darling among the Western critics, particularly Frank Schirrmacher. The Frankfurt paper publishes his poetry regularly. There's something frightening about the imagery in Grunbein's verse, and German critics welcome its anarchistic, occasionally criminal elements.
A Grunbein sample: " 'Still any bomb splinters?!' Good for spiked gums,/Installed in violet baby skulls./Tell me, which nurse pressed her thumb/unfeelingly into our soft fontanel?"
Grunbein, who considers Ezra Pound one of his biggest influences, explains that he wrote this after reading a poem by another young poet who lives in Cologne. He has much more of an affinity with this young peer in the West, to whom the poem is dedicated, than with writers like Christa Wolf.
These young writers see themselves less as East Germans than as writers who live in Germany. And they certainly have no hang-ups about parlaying the past three years into fiction. As the older writers hold back, the younger set is already getting attention.
Johannes Jansen, 26, and Holger Teschke, 34, are two good examples. Jansen, who writes abstract, experimental prose, has a contract with Suhrkamp Verlag, one of Germany's largest publishers, and has finished a trilogy. He is moving now toward "real stories," and is at work on a book-length parable whose protagonist is a blend of the hero of a Grimms Fairy Tale and Job. Teschke works as a producer at the famous Berliner Ensemble theater and he's on his way to the United States for a five-month stay at Amherst College, where he plans to write a novel about German reunification, possibly through the lens of the Thirty Years' War.
Still, the most likely source of a great and lasting literary work that tackles the fall of the Berlin wall and the collapse of Communism will be someone with the pure gift and historical reach of Christa Wolf. The wrenching period of the last three years is going to have to emerge in fictional form from someone of Wolf's stature -- perhaps from Wolf herself. No one has doubted her talent; it's her politics they question. Wolf says it is "laughable" for critics to expect a big literary work any time soon. She points out that it can take decades before a historic event is ready to be retold as fiction. Tolstoy wrote "War and Peace" 50 years after the Napoleonic wars; Hemingway wrote "A Farewell to Arms" 11 years after the Armistice.
Wolf's stay in Los Angeles, where such writers as Bertolt Brecht and Thomas Mann spent years in exile, may be just the prescription. "I think we'll see astonishing sentences from her," says the German writer Martin Walser. "A little California always does good," he adds, without a trace of humor. "Especially for the East German writers. They should all get stipends to go to California." That's not because they need a rest cure, but because they need some distance. Real distance, Walser adds, "from this terribly confining place. Germany."

HEADLINE: PROFILE;
At Milton, a Headmaster With a Difference

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

 BODY:
SOON AFTER Edwin P. Fredie assumed duties as Milton Academy's new headmaster in the fall of 1991, he surprised the campus at the season's first assembly by standing outside the hall and personally greeting each student. His friendliness went against the stereotype of the aloof headmaster of a venerable, prestigious New England boarding school.
Then, having established a reputation for accessibility at the school, in Milton, Mass., Mr. Fredie also demonstrated his authority. At an assembly in the spring where candidates running for student-body president gave campaign talks, one junior laced his speech with expletives. Mr. Fredie promptly stood up to object, saying that such language was inappropriate in a public assembly. 
"It stunned people," said Leopolvo Maza, a teacher of Spanish. "Milton is known for its individualism. But people also realized he was bringing important ethical standards."
Mr. Fredie's actions have been under particular scrutiny because he is the first black to be named headmaster of one of the major American private schools, which are often seen as protectors of privilege.
Moreover, while his name rhymes with "tweedy," the 47-year-old Mr. Fredie is decidedly not preppy. He is a product of public school education, albeit Boston's best -- the Boston Latin School -- and his career has been spent as a public school teacher and principal. That background made him an unusual choice for a private ivy-covered institution that was founded in 1798 and includes among its graduates the poet T. S. Eliot, the architect R. Buckminster Fuller and Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Edward M. Kennedy. With 972 students on its red-brick campus 10 miles south of Boston, Milton is generally considered one of the most sought-after schools in the nation.
But Milton's teachers, administrators and alumni are virtually unanimous in praising the performance of Mr. Fredie, a round-faced man with a quiet, low-key manner and a reputation as a skilled administrator. "It is too early for a definitive judgment, but all the signs are very positive," said Carol Surkin, a 1955 Milton graduate, a trustee and a co-chairwoman of the search committee that picked Mr. Fredie.
William Moore, a teacher of French, said, "He has established a new tone, a very direct, human, tolerant tone." And, Mr. Moore said, Mr. Fredie "represents multiple perspectives on class and race, so he is ideal for an institution like Milton that is committed to diversity."
 
Lives on Campus
 Mr. Fredie lives on campus in Milton's headmaster's house, a comfortable New England-style clapboard dwelling, with his wife, Marcia. After he became headmaster, she quit her job as a merchandise coordinator at The Talbot's, a women's clothing-store chain. Two of the Fredies' children are students at Milton, while a son, Michael, is studying at the Coast Guard Academy and a daughter, Kenya, is entering the Ph.D. anthropology program at the University of Arizona this month.
Although Mrs. Surkin and other members of the search committee deny that race was a factor in Mr. Fredie's selection, a number of people familiar with Milton say that, like other leading prep schools, it has been making a determined effort to be more democratic, trying to transform itself into a more culturally diverse school reflecting the realities of contemporary America.
Mr. Fredie's name was suggested not by the consultant the school hired, but by the parents of a student who lived in Needham, another Boston suburb, where Mr. Fredie was the high school principal.
There Mr. Fredie, whose father was a home builder and whose mother was a lawyer, had developed a stellar reputation. He had introduced a tough core curriculum that helped raise students' test scores.
He had also coped with sharply falling enrollment and consequent devastating cutbacks in state and local financing for public education as Massachusetts towns were hit by the effects of a new law that restricted their ability to raise property taxes. Under Mr. Fredie, Needham High School went from 1,800 students in three grades to 1,000 students in four grades. Mr. Fredie had to reduce the number of teachers to 100, from 150.
Mr. Fredie acknowledged that when the search committee invited him for a job interview, he was reluctant. "I had this image of private schools in England, uniforms and Mr. Chips," he said in an interview.
But he went, and wowed the committee. "I was sitting next to him and I was amazed," said George E. Ayers, a vice president of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, based in Washington, D.C. "He was so warm, he had a glow of caring about students."
As Mrs. Surkin remembers it, that Mr. Fredie would be the first black headmaster of a prep school "was a subject that really didn't come up -- none of us cared."
 
A Warning on Donors
 But Mr. Ayers, who is also black, said he reminded the committee that some alumni, and potential donors, might be concerned. "I've spent 90 percent of my life being the only black dealing with a white world," he said. "I said, 'You'll definitely have some people with that concern.' "
There was a sense of shock that Mr. Fredie, who became interested in education while registering black voters in rural Georgia in 1965 and had since devoted himself wholeheartedly to the public education system, would want to move to a private school. After graduating from Boston University and receiving a master's degree from the Harvard School of Education, he taught at Harlem's Public School 129 in New York City and in the Needham public school system.
Mr. Fredie's answer is direct. He had become "frustrated and disappointed with public education," he said, and was planning to retire soon anyway, to seek a job in another field.
In his view, "public education is going in the wrong direction." For one thing, schools are burdened by an increasingly centralized bureaucracy, with more and more state mandates requiring reams of paperwork. "Less and less time is devoted to actually finding out what makes good students and teachers," he said.
In public schools, he said, "Everyone is on an assembly line. The structure of the school is based on economics, not educational excellence." Teachers, through their unions, "have become consumed by how much money they can make. They have become focused on what is good for them, not what is good for students."
"I know my colleagues will say that the problem is that kids from single-parent families are not prepared to learn," he said. "But any kid can succeed. What you need is a teacher who can challenge you."
The proof, Mr. Fredie said, can be found at Milton. "We have kids from very privileged backgrounds. And we have some from very dysfunctional families. But you can't tell the difference. The reason is that our classes are small and our teachers are dedicated."
At Milton, he said, "We have teachers who are not afraid to tell kids, 'I'll see you on Monday afternoon at 3, and you're going to be here till you get it right.' "
 
48 Percent Are Girls
 Milton starts with kindergarten, though the largest bulge of students is in the 9th through 12th grades; it has always been coeducational and today 48 percent of the enrollees are girls. Tuition for boarders is $19,000 a year. Some 25 percent of the students receive financial aid, and 10 percent are black, some of them from neighboring Mattapan, a heavily black and low-income section of Boston.
Milton's proximity to a large black community presents both an opportunity and source of concern. Last September, several black students from Milton High School showed up at Milton Academy for what was supposed to be a closed dance. A security guard, following orders, turned them away. But some students from the academy who knew the visitors came out and argued that the guard was discriminating based on their color.
Mr. Fredie moved swiftly to defuse the incident. He spoke about it in an assembly, and brought together the students and security guard to discuss the issue. The academy's security staff has also been directed to join special sessions devoted to multicultural awareness being run at the school by a private Boston company.
Deval Patrick, class of 1974, a member of Milton's board of trustees and a lawyer in Boston, said Mr. Fredie's actions showed one of his strengths -- he sees everything as an educational opportunity. "When there is a minor crisis," Mr. Patrick said, "he uses it to help kids mature."

HEADLINE: The Middle Class Goes Public

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
DURING the last generation, the idea of middle-class people enrolling their children in urban public schools has become something akin to letting the youngsters play in traffic: too dangerous for any sensible parent to even consider.
So when people move to a new city, they are often greeted with the kind of advice that Susan Krinsky, who lives in New Orleans, heard time and again: "You cannot, of course, send your kids to the public schools. Here is a list of the acceptable private schools." 
 But growing numbers of middle-class parents are organizing in defense of public schools. They contend that the horror stories about public schools have been exaggerated and tinted by racial stereotypes. And they say private schools present their own set of perils by creating a sheltered, homogeneous world for children who will graduate unprepared for a diverse society. Others say they simply cannot afford the high-priced tuition of private academies, and will fight to improve the public schools, for which they pay taxes anyway.
Whatever the reasons, public schools have lately been holding their own on enrollment, a generation after middle-class people began leaving in droves. Nationally, the number of children in private schools has leveled off in recent years at about 10.5 percent.
 
Nationwide Growth
 The successes of a group in Jackson, Miss., to restore racial and economic balance to public schools has inspired the creation of chapters nationwide called Parents for Public Schools. In Jackson, a racial integration plan in the 1980's fueled "white flight" that changed public school enrollment from 60 percent white to 80 percent black. The departure of middle-class families, along with their loss of faith in the schools, led to the failure of bond issues that threatened to eviscerate school programs.
In 1989, 26 parents joined in trying to persuade middle-class people to reconsider public schools. They targeted four elementary schools that had become virtually all black. In four years, they have succeeded in building an enrollment that reflects the racial makeup of those neighborhoods; the schools are now 60 to 65 percent white.
"We told people, 'Let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater,' " said Sandra Murley, executive director of the Jackson group, which has 3,500 members nationally. "The public schools can be what we want them to be if we just hang in there." She added: "We've got a lot of children growing up in settings that don't reflect the community. People today don't have a lot of empathy for those unlike themselves. And I think that's because they don't know much about them."
Scholars who have followed school enrollments say middle-class parents are hardly rushing back to public schools in great numbers. But they express optimism that more parents appear to be open to the idea. Many public schools, meanwhile, have aggressively courted the middle class, designing special programs that smaller private schools cannot afford to offer.
 
Is the Tide Turning?
 "We still see a lot of movement away from the public schools," said Amy Stuart Wells, an assistant professor of educational policy at the University of California at Los Angeles. "But it could be that the tide is turning back. We've spent the last 10 years beating up on the public schools. Maybe the next stage will be concentrating on ways to fix them. The fundamental question is: Do we still want public education in this country?"
Ms. Krinsky, who is the associate dean at Tulane University's law school, said she would hear people at parties criticize public schools. When she would ask, "Have you ever been in one of the schools?" she said the answer was usually, "Well, no."
Before their children reached school age, Ms. Krinsky said that she and her family assumed they would choose private schools. But while voting at a nearby school, she was struck by its vibrancy and by the creative drawings on the walls. So she talked with a principal, who allowed her to sit in on classes.
"I didn't see anything go on that doesn't go on in a private school," Ms. Krinsky said. "And I saw a lot happening that doesn't go on in a private school -- like racial integration."
To be sure, even their most enthusiastic defenders acknowledge that many public schools, especially in big cities, are riven with serious problems. The debate over "school choice" and tax vouchers for private schools illustrates the widespread discontent with public schools.
Even in affluent suburban districts, some parents have become frustrated with what they consider an insensitive bureaucracy. "When parents do get involved, the administrators patronize you, then they ignore you, then they confront you, then they threaten you," said Phil Burgess, the head of a research organization.
When classes opened last fall, Mr. Burgess said, his second-grade daughter brought home a teacher's note to parents. "It said essentially, 'Our job is the three "r's" -- reading, writing and arithmetic. And your job is respect, responsibility and rectitude.' The implication was: you stay out of our business and we'll stay out of yours."
For years, the notion of the superiority of private schools and upper-middle-class suburban schools has gone virtually unchallenged. But some parents have found those schools wanting. After sending her daughter to private school for a year, Allyson Shuldberg Eccles, who lives in Denver, said, "I felt like we had tossed away $6,000."
In choosing a private school, the Eccleses had "followed the old adage -- you get what you pay for," said Milton Eccles, an investment consultant. "But it didn't work out that way." Their daughter received no more attention than she had in public school.
Then Ms. Eccles discovered a magnet public school called Denver School of the Arts, which opened last year. There her daughter takes two drama classes a day and a music class, in addition to her regular academic load. Ms. Eccles was also struck with the diversity of children on the public school playgrounds. "You didn't just see white kids and black kids," she said. "There were Hispanic kids, Asian kids. There were kids from Russia."
Like many big-city districts, Denver lost huge numbers of middle-class whites after a Federal judge in 1969 ordered its schools to become racially integrated. Twenty years later, schools that had been two-thirds "Anglo," or non-Hispanic white, were now only one-third.
But in the last four years the white population has leveled off, and the district's enrollment has stabilized. Denver schools are now about 42 percent Hispanic, 31.5 percent white, 21.6 percent black, 3.7 percent Asian and 1.2 percent American Indian, according to the city's Board of Education.
The public schools have learned that they must market themselves to win back middle-class students, said Dorothy Gotlieb, the president of the Denver Board of Education.
So the Denver schools recently ran television advertisements. They were produced for free by a local agency. Air time was paid by the television station and local businesses.
In one ad, a narrator intones: "You will always find those who excel in school and are successful after leaving it. But you don't usually find so many, who do so well, from the same place. Ladies and gentlemen, graduates of the Denver public schools." The ad then displays a long list of former students who have gained prominence.
Denver has also dropped the tuition requirement for nonresident students. This year, 1,200 students from the suburbs are attending Denver schools.
 
Notions of Status
 In some places, the choice of a school is bound up with notions of status. Ms. Krinsky said an acquaintance had fretted that his business contacts would look askance when they learned his children attended public schools. "He was worried that sending his kids to public school would hurt him professionally," she said.
Paul Reams, an executive at the International Business Machines Corporation in Macon, Ga., said that on learning that his children attend public school, some members of his church "pretty much say: 'What's wrong with you? You can afford a private school.' "
In many cases, Mr. Reams said, people draw conclusions about city schools based on the buildings, which tend to be in need of repair, and the neighborhoods, which have comparatively high crime rates. "I went into a public school and looked around," he said. "What I found was teachers who really cared and kids who were bright and hopeful. We're very happy with our decision."

HEADLINE: BLACKBOARD;
What's New At the U.N.? Ask Drew U.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POLLAK

 BODY:
THE WORTH of the United Nations may be debated at least as long as Saddam Hussein survives, but its popularity could be measured by Drew University's Semester on the United Nations.
For 30 years, Drew, in Madison, N.J., has offered a semester of formal study at United Nations headquarters in Manhattan; the semester is also open to non-Drew students. Most of that time Drew has had the only regular on-site campus program there, with its own office across First Avenue from the General Assembly building and a veteran United Nations officer as assistant director. 
 "The dead period, so to speak, was the mid-1970's to the mid-1980's," said Richard S. Rhone, a political science professor who has directed the semester for much of the last 20 years. Once the cold war paralyzed the Security Council and the agency turned to patrolling neutral zones and promoting economic development and humanitarian aid, interest fell. Those tasks were "quite frankly, not as sexy and exciting" as the original image of enforcing collective security, he said.
"Since the mid-1980's it's a whole new world out there," Professor Rhone said. With the end of the cold war and the Persian Gulf fighting, more students have shown interest in the security apparatus of the United Nations, he said. Enrollment, however, is limited to 30.
Students are currently being briefed on the United Nations' role in supplying aid to Somalia, a role the professor called somewhere between the armed force of the gulf war and typical peacekeeping. "The program emphasis changes as the emphasis of the U.N. changes," he said.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Programs In a Meltdown

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
NUCLEAR power has grabbed headlines lately because of the premature retirement of several reactors, but something else in the industry is quietly withering away: its educational infrastructure.
Nationwide, only about 1,000 college juniors and seniors are enrolled in nuclear engineering degree programs, down from a peak of about 2,100 in the late 1970's, according to Energy Department surveys. Enrollment in master's programs stands at about 800, down from 1,400 in the mid-70's. 
 At first glance the department's surveys suggest that doctoral students are bucking the trend: their numbers have risen slightly since the mid-70's, to about 700. But half the students are from abroad. And while foreigners constitute a large proportion of most doctoral engineering programs in the United States, foreign graduates in other fields tend to stay here, university professors report; in the nuclear field they go home, because their countries are building more plants than this country is.
 
Undergraduates Drop
 Still, at least the doctoral programs can survive on foreign students until a time when more American students might apply. Energy Department figures show the number of undergraduate programs dropping from 80 in 1975 to 53 in the last academic year.
More precipitous is the decline in the number of research reactors, the tools near the heart of the graduate programs. About 27 survive, down from 76 in the mid-70's. Some succumbed to student losses; others to increasing maintenance and security costs.
The demise of nuclear engineering programs mimics the industry's slump. Until the mid-1970's, experts were predicting that there would be 1,000 power-generating reactors in this country by the turn of the century, and by 1978 utilities nationwide had placed orders for 250 reactors. But half those orders were canceled, and the reactor population now stands at 111 and falling.
Most were done in by unfavorable economics; compared with other sources of electricity, reactors were too expensive to build and operate. The 1979 accident at Three Mile Island did not improve the industry's image. But professors say that students do not mention this.
It's all bad news for engineering schools, said Kenneth C. Rogers, who was president of the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., until President Reagan appointed him to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission five years ago. "The problem is that it hasn't been perceived as an expanding, exciting field to go into," Mr. Rogers said.
The drop in the number of nuclear engineering students would not be an issue if it paralleled the job market. But nuclear engineers, along with other specialists like radiation protection technicians, are likely to be in high demand as the Federal Government begins to clean up its complex for producing nuclear weapons. As a legacy of 40 years of nuclear weapons production, the Energy Department has polluted vast areas and has thousands of buildings to decontaminate.
The department says that the project is the largest environmental restoration project in history. It will require tearing down old structures and putting up factories to process wastes into safer forms and other "engineered structures," from bunkers to fabricated caves, to store wastes. The project will also require constant attention to radiation exposure and to the potential for concentrating scraps of bomb fuel. If too much fuel is brought together, a chain reaction will result, creating a lethal shower of radiation and spreading the wastes.
 
Licenses Expiring
 At Pennsylvania State University, Edward H. Klevans, head of the nuclear program and an associate dean in the college of engineering, sees other reasons the nuclear industry may need more engineers. In the next few years some plants will approach the expiration of their 40-year operating licenses and will apply for extensions, Professor Klevans said. Recertifying them would require extensive engineering work.
But even plant retirements will create jobs, he said, since the fuel must be carefully removed; then contaminated parts must be cleaned or painstakingly cut up with remote-controlled equipment for disposal, and worker exposure to radiation must be minimized.
And new plants could be built. The energy bill that Congress passed last year simplifies the rules for licensing a new generation of power reactors, and smoothes the way for disposal of nuclear waste, in hopes of eventually spawning a rebirth of the technology.
Indeed, by some projections there could be more jobs than people to fill them. A 1990 report by the National Academy of Sciences said that if orders for nuclear plants resume, the demand for nuclear engineers could double or triple. "This demand would greatly exceed the output of current nuclear engineering programs even if they were to expand to full capacity," the study found.
In case of shortage, the industry is likely to rely more heavily on other kinds of engineers, who would be specially trained for nuclear work. Already, nuclear engineering professors say, utilities are following this path. But people trained as nuclear engineers are better suited, experts in the field say, because they have a particularly broad background in physics, chemistry, fluid mechanics, and other areas.
The civilian nuclear industry had hoped that its fortunes, and its recruits, would be strengthened by the public's recent focus on the environment. From acid rain to global warming, electric utilities are beset with problems that nuclear power would seem to sidestep.
But that has not lured more students, said Kent F. Hansen, a professor of nuclear engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a faculty member for 30 years. In discussions with students entering the field, Professor Hansen said, "Only a few said they were concerned about nuclear being environmentally more benign than the alternatives."
The reasons they did give, he said, were varied and pedestrian: Some had lived near nuclear plants; others had friends and neighbors who were nuclear engineers; still others were interested in an engineering field they consider more exotic than others.
The industry is trying to shore up this educational base. The Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, a utility group formed after the Three Mile Island accident to increase communication among utilities and bring peer pressure to bear on those with operating problems, last year sponsored 275 undergraduate scholarships and 40 graduate-level fellowships. One goal, said Angelina Howard, a spokeswoman, is to keep talented people "going into the educational pipeline and coming out into the industry."
But the key, Professor Hansen said, will be the new plant orders. "I don't see how it can carry on without that happening," he said.

Can Botstein Convince The Young?

BYLINE: By Alex Ross

 BODY:
With typical irony, the composer Hector Berlioz wrote that "for all the obvious shortcomings of a performance the conductor is not blamed." Except, perhaps, when the conductor is also a college president, whirlwind polymath and minor celebrity. Leon Botstein, in his first three concerts as music director of the American Symphony Orchestra, fashioned programs on interdisciplinary themes, largely devoid of familiar music; his musicianship did not quite live up to the richness of his aims, and blame naturally fell on him.
Shortcomings were easily found in the first half of the season. The American Symphony does not have a sumptuous tone, and the conductor is no virtuoso. Performances sometimes lost momentum, and power was restored in crude climaxes. Mr. Botstein distracted himself and the audience with breathless, overstated pronouncements between works: "There's really something very dangerous about this piece," he said several times. He offered too many ideas at once. The great German conductor Hans von Bulow, who advised colleagues to keep the score in the head, not the head in the score, might have made an exception here. 
 But Mr. Botstein's slow progress as a conductor does not diminish the overriding importance of his goals. With financial crises in the wings, orchestras must take strenuous action to save themselves; Mr. Botstein has shown one possible path, more or less discarding the traditional repertory in programs arranged around distinct, often extramusical topics. The first concert, in September, gathered music of Europeans who lived in America during World War II (Martinu, Korngold, Hindemith, Weill); the second, in November, examined the influence of surrealism on composers (Poulenc, Cage, Varese, Koechlin); the third, late last month, linked American modernist painters with compositional contemporaries (Cowell, Copland, Feldman, Sessions and others).
This approach addresses, first, the widening rift between concerts and recordings. With the explosion of novelties on records, collectors have been inventing their own alternative repertory, their own musical subculture. A solitary rendition of a work by Martinu or Feldman can assume greater importance than all 69 current CD's of Mozart's "Kleine Nachtmusik." Many of these listeners, unwilling to let the aloof machinations of big-league programming dictate what they hear, have been avoiding concert halls. They may find solace in Mr. Botstein's off-center programming.
So may some others. Everyone murmurs religiously these days that classical music must find new, young listeners. Influenced, perhaps, by the 20-something generation's reputation for superficiality, some recommend a glossy repackaging of tradition, a make-over. They are wrong. This coveted young audience resists classical music precisely because it seems remote, shrouded, wrapped up in itself. They find musical sophistication elsewhere -- for instance, in the brand of alternative rock that links individuality with social skepticism. A devotee of Pere Ubu's "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo" may not see the need for Penderecki's "Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima."
Mr. Botstein's concept has potential to convince younger listeners that classical music is not some cobwebbed ghost ship, lost in time. The ultimate task remains the rejuvenation of new music. (In contrast to the American Symphony of the Stokowski era, 1962-72, when premieres came fast and furious, Mr. Botstein's orchestra has so far avoided works written after 1975.) But without some sense of what went on earlier in the century, premieres will continue to be greeted either by dull incomprehension or by a fleeting, circuslike excitement. What must be cultivated is a nontraditional vision of the musical past that emphasizes links between music and society, between music and other cultural disciplines in which the younger generation is better schooled.
This vision will be difficult to achieve. Simply publicizing the American Symphony venture is a Sisyphean task. Eugene Carr, the orchestra's executive director, says that subscriptions are up 20 percent, and that new ticket buyers have been drawn in by offbeat advertising techniques and low ticket prices. The audience for the one Friday-night concert did look a bit younger, but the somewhat sparse crowd on Sunday afternoons resembled the norm (the Mumbler, the Dozer, the Unwrapper and other familiar characters).
Mr. Botstein, for his part, faces the challenge of ensemble precision; crucial elements of his audience, the connoisseurs and record collectors, expect sharper performances. He also needs to adopt a less professorial tone. Lectures should be confined to the beginning of each half to avoid the deadly appearance of "tagging" each work as an academic find. And the programming should have more balance. "This is a program Leopold Stokowski would have been proud of," Mr. Botstein boasted at one concert; but Stokowski would have linked the obscurities to a better-known work, which the audience could use as a point of reference (as when he paired Ives's Fourth Symphony with Beethoven's Fifth).
Most of the performances have been acceptable; a few have been inspired. Given time, Mr. Botstein should be able to produce polished performances of serious intent, as his Richard Strauss festival at Bard College showed last summer. If in the end he falls short, younger audiences may indeed be out of reach, and larger failures will follow.

Pop Can Survive Almost Anything. But Respect?!

BYLINE: By Jon Pareles

 BODY:
A President who plays saxophone, admires Elvis Presley and came of age in the late 1960's is bound to affect the course of popular music. Bill Clinton doubtless has memories of a time when popular music helped shake America loose from white-bread 50's illusions, and he clearly likes the stuff; Aretha Franklin sang at his convention. During the campaign, Al Gore was so up to date he cited R.E.M. albums when facing a young audience in Georgia.
The question for the next four years is whether R-E-S-P-E-C-T from the top will make popular music more innovative, or more complacent. Under a pluralistic administration, new musical coalitions could be built, but genres that have been screaming in the wilderness may find themselves with less to complain about. 
 For more than a decade, popular music has been greeted with negligence, incomprehension and suspicion. The Reagan years brought the first Senate hearings about popular music since the 1950's (convened by a subcommittee that Mr. Gore headed after his wife, Tipper, fanned parental anxieties). The Senate's jaw-boning led to warning labels on potentially offensive albums. Although George Bush posed with an electric guitar at his inaugural, the two Republican Administrations clearly came from the pre-rock generation.
President Bush's vaunted love of country music seemed mostly a marketing tactic. Even so, during his Administration, country made huge commercial gains. But Nashville's rise, as personified by Garth Brooks, actually parallels the Clinton campaign: acknowledging but not emphasizing Southern roots, using modern showmanship, and making a direct pitch for suburban and baby-boomer audiences.
If the mainstream follows the President's public example, there are some obvious predictions for the Clinton years. The upswing in Elvis imagery may start a 50's revival that makes "Grease" look authentic. And baby boomers are bound to try to reclaim the high ground of rock from the grunge, hip-hop and thrash noise makers who make boomers feel old. Will Wynonna Judd and the Red Hot Chili Peppers sing vintage Motown songs?
As a saxophonist, the President-elect is rhythmically challenged and sounds anemic, yet his example should boost interest in jazz and blues. And while the Smithsonian is already committed to American vernacular music, a Presidential imprimatur can only help confirm the legitimacy of honkers and shouters. But Mr. Clinton is a centrist; he won't kick the National Symphony Orchestra out of the Kennedy Center.
The resurgent feminism that helped elect Mr. Clinton is already giving women a stronger voice across pop and is battling the misogyny that mars hard-rock and hip-hop. The Clinton campaign's emphasis on tolerance could also lessen homophobia. With luck, the nastiest voices will begin to sound dated and unhip.
Since family values issues failed to sway most voters, the moral panic around popular music (and other cultural forms) may recede. The result could be a renewal of free-speech guarantees, from the National Endowment for the Arts to major entertainment conglomerates.
At the same time, performers who depend largely on shock value and sensationalism are likely to miss the inevitable publicity. Tolerance may do more to blunt the Andrew Dice Clays and 2 Live Crews of the world than all the outrage and litigation of the last decade. It would be an appropriate moment for Tipper Gore, who is still affiliated with the Parents Music Resource Center (which led the movement for warning labels on albums), to resign from the group, and to admit that much of the center's so-called educational materials reflected the influence of the religious right.
Democratic Administrations presided over one of rock's most fertile periods, from 1961-68, and one of its most contradictory ones, 1977-80, during Jimmy Carter's Presidency. In the 60's, under Kennedy and Johnson, an expanding economy and the friction over civil rights and Vietnam convinced rockers that they represented a vanguard community, that they could experiment yet stay popular. The Carter years were another story, with domesticity in the foreground and economic turbulence lurking. A recession bred the comfortable, introspective corporate pop of groups like the Eagles or Fleetwood Mac (who provided the Clinton campaign's theme song), the boom and bust of disco, and the radical mutations of punk-rock and hip-hop, which were influential but commercially marginal.
The Reagan-Bush years made a whole generation feel marginal. People in their teens and 20's faced indifferent elders, the affluent yuppies. People in power grabbed consumer goodies, sliced spending for education and infrastructure, and shunted young workers toward jobs as hamburger flippers and keypunch operators. Young folks couldn't distract themselves with unrestrained sexual license or drug-induced pleasures, either.
In response, the growth areas of late-80's and early-90's popular music offered mechanical dance-beat escapism and tidings of anger and death. Rock grew even more contrary. Black separatist hip-hop counterbalanced racially divisive Willie Horton campaign advertisements; after the Reagan defense buildup and backpedaling on the environment sustained countless songs about nuclear war, dying on the battlefield and toxic terror. Instead of the implicit optimism of protest songs, apocalyptic thrash bands and rappers offered a chance to vent.
The priorities of the new Administration are likely to ricochet, directly and contrarily, through the popular music of the mid-90's. Clinton likes high technology; dancers already like techno music. Hillary Clinton's interest in children's issues may bring more songs about child abuse, troubled families and growing up ignored or uneducated.
Those concerns, in turn, may be part of a general shift away from global affairs to private ones. As everyone knows by now, Chelsea Clinton's name was suggested by a late 60's Joni Mitchell song; the Clinton years may bring a new crop of confessional songwriters, though they'll probably use drum machines along with finger-picking.
By raising expectations, the Clinton Administration is bound to sidetrack some musical extremists. With the cold war over, thrashers are already backing away from the H-bomb repertory; the new Administation's environmental initiatives could make pollution seem less threatening. If the politicians address such broad issues, rock's most vociferous pessimists might turn to personal miseries.
Hip-hop may not be so easily mollified. The Presidential campaign avoided virtually all discussion of urban issues, and one of Clinton's cheapest shots was a swipe at the little-known but divisive rapper Sister Souljah and, through her, at the Rev. Jesse Jackson. (Rappers, among the most self-conscious of community spokespeople, are likely to shout even louder if they feel no one is listening.)
Yet with that conspicuous exception, the Clinton Administration arrives on a promising mandate. The electorate voted not for some imagined good old days or to "stay the course," but to make changes, perhaps even to experiment. It wants something new, and that -- not revivals or reactions -- is what stimulates the best popular music.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Hold the Hunk Stuff, The Man's an Actor First

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

 BODY:
Liam Neeson was letting a bit of his subliminated Irishness show, worrying like Yeats about his stony epitaph. "Is this what's going to be on my tombstone? 'He dated Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand.' "
The actor, for all his careful study of Hollywood and its narcissistic folkways, was railing pleasantly at how his social and personal life gets misrepresented in what for the last five years has been his hometown, the Hollywood Hills, an ocean and a culture away from Ballymena, County Antrim, the small rural town where he was born in Northern Ireland. 
 His point is well taken, of course. How can the gossips of Tinseltown imply he's just a 6-foot-4 Celtic hunk on the evidence of a few celebrity dates and friendships, when Mr. Neeson is in the midst of a more than average run of acting, recharging himself in what he talks of as his ancient craft of itinerant pretenders and vagabond make-believers. Just his sort of people, he says thankfully, while his limousine waits outside a hotel on Central Park South in Manhattan to get him back to rehearsal.
Fresh from gimping about in the title role of the forthcoming film version of Edith Wharton's "Ethan Frome," a job of work that presents no assault on the Schwarzenegger school of thespian arts, Mr. Neeson is taking a 10-week break from Hollywood to appear on Broadway in the Roundabout Theater Company production of "Anna Christie." This is Eugene O'Neill's ever-dark evergreen about failed life and love on the seafaring fringe. It opens on Thursday at the Criterion Center with Mr. Neeson playing the drunken, lyrical suitor to Natasha Richardson's fallen Anna, and Rip Torn as her sad, sodden father.
With this, his first stage role in eight years, the 40-year-old actor is consciously trying to have it both ways, doing some heavy lifting for the vagabond craft to sharpen his edge for returning to the Hollywood Hills for another crack at the crass art of becoming box office. He speaks of it that bluntly, invoking Gary Cooper and James Cagney as ghostly role models for his goal of seeing if he can master the right mix of the acting and money arts.
"They don't give a damn out there if you did the greatest Hamlet of the decade or whatever," he says. "But if you're in a hit film -- doesn't matter if you're an average actor, a competent actor or not -- then you'll be the flavor. They'll send you scripts and they'll evolve films around you," he says, with a mix of envy and loathing.
"Nowadays, if you've got a ponytail and a nice Armani suit and the gift of the gab you can make it in Hollywood," he says, mourning the old days he imagines when there was at least a studio craft system. "But I'd love to be in a hit film," he has to admit. "And then I'll decide the life after that."
Thus far, Mr. Neeson carefully measures his journeyman's strivings in 15 films across five years, incidentally describing a Hollywood that is strange and ingrown enough to seem just over the rise from Ballymena, particularly when his mother, Kitty, pays a visit. She goes walking the Hollywood Hills and cadges a cup of tea and a life story from some of her son's mystery neighbors in the cinema jungle.
"I'd say, 'Mommy, you've been gone hours. Where were you?' " says Mr. Neeson, slipping into the Irish narrative gift at life's small events. "And she'd say, 'Well, I was on a walk and met this nice man who brought me in and made me tea.' And then she'd give me another life story of someone."
Mr. Neeson, his voice low and sardonic, makes the Hollywood thicket seem at least as real and foggy as O'Neill's waterfront. "It will be interesting after this play to see how long I can take it back there," says the actor, whose experience is grounded in the Irish and English stage.
"I mean, Hollywood is the center of the English-speaking cinema. That's where the work is. It's not in London and it's certainly not in Ireland," says Mr. Neeson, who took a flier from those workplaces in 1987 and gambled on cracking the movies, arriving in Los Angeles, he recalls, with just five weeks' rent and a resolve not to be narrowly typecast as a boy-o off the boat.
"I told these guys: 'Please don't say I'm an Irish actor,' " he recalls of the agents he hired. "I'm an actor. An actor who wants to audition for parts for an actor my age."
Mr. Neeson is also a big handsome man with a memorable look of self-doubt on his broad face. This is a casting quality that, as he moves safely beyond his five-week gamble, seems to pass as easily for urban angst, as in one of the confused-lover roles that he played in Woody Allen's "Husbands and Wives," as for self-tragedy in O'Neill's Mat Burke and Wharton's Ethan Frome, or even self-comedy, as in his part as a Kansas sheriff in Steve Martin's new film, "Leap of Faith."
About the film "Ethan Frome," to be released on Feb. 26, and his role of almost inarticulate pathos demanding the twisted-body acting of a Lon Chaney, he says he is pleased -- as much for the movie's lean economics as its artistic goals. "I'm very proud of that -- made for $2.4 million when the average Hollywood film costs $25 million," he stresses. Less certainly, he adds, about the film directed by John Madden: "I'm scared to say it's my best work, but I feel the role suits me and I suit the role."
Mr. Neeson says O'Neill reminds him of some of the O'Casey and other Irish masterworks he did at the Abbey Theater in Dublin. "A poetic construction," he says. "You can really go for this stuff. It's not like Stoppard, where you play with words or everybody hides emotions through wonderfully odd sentences. This guy O'Neill goes straight for it.
"The play is unbelievably passionate and everybody bares their soul," he says about the rehearsals, pleased at the chance to work with Natasha Richardson, who talked him into playing Mat Burke, the broken-hearted coal stoker. "David Leveaux, the director, gave us a great talk and said we have to go for this: 'Trust me as I'm trusting you. Let's take this as far as we can, and don't be afraid, because whatever pain or misery or happiness you're feeling on stage, just imagine O'Neill felt 10 times that to inspire him to write this.' "
So the O'Neill sounds as though it will do as a breather, even if it may not be the real-life struggle of Hollywood. "In the early days of rehearsing, I was seeing how far I could go. I was far too theatrical. But the play holds you up," he explains. "Twelve hours of rehearsals a day and you'll still do two more at the pub later talking about it."
In speaking like so many before him of getting back to his roots on stage, Mr. Neeson says he has had to dust off three different sorts of Irish accents to play Mat Burke. "At times, O'Neill makes my character passionate, like he's from the west of Ireland, and I'll pronounce 'slap' as givin' ya a great 'shlap'! Other times, he's Dublin gutteral: 'A hard whorulld -- world -- it is.' Or flat Belfast: 'You'll be wishin' you were married to a FAIR-mur' -- a farmer." A big smile at this, the actor so dedicated to full-craft acting resorting, like the latest rap-star Hollywood transport, to playing bits of himself.
"I'm doing this play in part because I'm always lambasting young actors out there who wouldn't know a theater if they passed it on the street. They arrive there by the truckload every day, these young beautiful girls and boys hoping to be soap opera stars. No craft at all, looking for the easy life," he says, Nathanael West-angry, not O'Neill-despairing, about his life.
"I'm here for my sanity," he summarizes, sipping tea by the hotel bar, minutes from escaping by limo back into O'Neill's bleak lyricism. "I'd hate to be in Hollywood at age 18 or 19 and believe all that blather."
Mr. Neeson is proud he has been coming on steadily out there, being remembered occasionally, by casting specialists at least, for playing Diane Keaton's thoughtful boyfriend in "The Good Mother" or the deaf mute helped by Cher in "Suspect."
"I've avoided being pigeonholed so far, knock on wood. But I'm not going to flog myself stupid if it doesn't happen," he takes care to contend, the "it" being box-office brute force.
"I'm paying the bills and my next role is up for grabs," says the actor, sounding like O'Neill's stoker retreating to the sea, shipping out in a limo. "But that's what I like about acting. You know, I'm a single guy and I love being able to pack a suitcase at a moment's notice and head off somewhere. I like being from that."
He stops for a kind of epitaph worthy of a tombstone in Hollywood, not Ballymena. "Sometimes I'm sitting out there in L.A. by my pool and it's 85 degrees and I suddenly think, 'I'm lonesome.' And then I take a fresh look about me, and I say, 'Stuff it, I'm doing all right here -- I could be digging ditches back in Ireland.' "

HEADLINE: Packages Unwrapped: A Sampling

BYLINE: By SUZANNE MacNEILLE; SUZANNE MacNEILLE is a journalist who specializes in travel.

 BODY:
IF the thought of traveling to London during the most off of the off-season months has never crossed your mind, tour operators with package deals to Britain will be happy to supply reasons why you might consider switching your July vacation to January or February. You won't have to stand on line to see the Crown Jewels; the theater season is in full swing; Harrods winter sale is on. They will also assert that a week in London can be surprisingly inexpensive, even for the traditionally slow off-season.
How is it possible that six nights in London, including air fare, can cost as little as $449? The dollar's new-found strength -- at the end of December the pound was worth only about $1.55, compared with $1.93 a year earlier -- is the major reason. 
 The stronger dollar, says Neil Johnson, marketing director of Travel Bound, which is offering the $449 deal, has "made London a truly affordable place to consider."
Christopher Ford, president of Europe Express, which has a $469 six-night air-land London package, said the downward trend in tour prices had also come about because London hotels were offering lower rates. "In real terms, London is as cheap as it's been in many years," Mr. Ford said.
Aside from these factors, of course, tour packagers can usually offer lower prices than the independent traveler pays because they reserve blocks of rooms -- and airline seats -- and get them at special rates.
Some of the current London packages, including the Europe Express program, which started at $569 last winter, cost even less than in the 1991-92 season. At that time airlines and tour companies, eager to persuade Americans to cross the Atlantic during the height of the recession, kept prices almost as low as they did the year before -- when the Gulf war was hurting travel to Europe. The recession and the Gulf war were blamed for reducing the number of American visitors to Britain from more than 3 million in 1990 to 2.25 million in 1991. In a sense they have also set the pricing standards for 1993.
For instance, in its current brochure, British Airways, which maintains it is the largest wholesaler of British packages in the United States, lists hotel rates comparable to last year's, in some cases lower.
Air fares are also staying at levels similar to last year's. As of Dec. 30 American Airlines was publishing a round-trip midweek fare from New York of $379, which must be purchased two weeks in advance for travel through March 31. That fare is the same as last winter. British Airways also offers a $379 ticket with similar restrictions. USAir has a round-trip weekday fare of $306, which must be purchased within 48 hours of booking. USAir's New York-London flight involves connections through Baltimore, Pittsburgh or other cities.
This year most operators are promoting packages that focus mainly on the essentials: air fare coupled with hotels, or selling hotel space separately, on a per-night basis.
"There used to be a philosophy of including everything in a single program," said Patrick Henry, manager of international product development for American Airlines' Fly AAway Vacations, which offers six-night London hotel stays starting at $191 a person, sharing a double room.
"In the past few years we've been going more and more for a bare-bones structure to which you can add on." This, he says, keeps prices down.
But even with the strong dollar, and the bare-bones argument, some of these deals seem too good to be true. Are they just attempts to persuade you to trade up to higher-priced lodgings? Is the hotel some dump on the outskirts of London? Would it be cheaper to fashion your own package, utilizing a low air fare and booking the hotels yourself?
Calling as an ordinary tourist -- in mid-December -- to book a selection of packages offered by tour companies proved to be a straightforward process. There were no attempts to bait and switch to a higher-priced hotel. Rooms in all categories were readily available (though reservations at least two weeks ahead are suggested). In some cases, the operator offered a savings of 50 percent or more over the hotel's regular rates.
As for the hotels themselves, an inspection of eight budget and medium-priced hotels used in package tours -- and listed in the accompanying article -- suggested that, while most involve some sort of trade-off, they generally offer clean bedrooms with private bathrooms, television and radio, and direct-dial telephone. All have at least one restaurant and one bar.
THE programs highlighted below, all of the bare-bones variety, are only a sampling of the many packages available; most airlines flying to London, and many tour companies, offer them. All prices, including the hotel's listed rates, which are given for comparative purposes, are per person, double occupancy. Taxes and service charges are included. (The totals are calculated at the rate of about $1.55 to the pound.) Extra nights can usually be added.
The prices of packages that include air fare are based on weekday, round-trip economy fares from New York, Newark and other Northeastern cities. The $379 round-trip fares recently quoted by British Airways and American are used for comparison, although fares may drop $20 or more as the season progresses. The cost of air transfers is based on the approximately $15 one would spend on bus fare to and from Heathrow and central London. (Gatwick is slightly more expensive.)
The prices quoted are for the winter season -- but keep in mind that March, traditionally the last month of the off-season, is often more expensive, sometimes by as much as 30 percent, than January and February. Some of the more expensive hotels have additional periods when higher rates apply.
All of the tour companies have complicated refund policies, described in detail in the brochures. When a traveler cancels, most companies will charge a fee and-or a percentage of the package price, based on how many days in advance the trip is canceled. All operators strongly suggest purchasing trip-cancellation insurance.
British Airways, (800) 247-9297, offers its passengers London packages with few or many frills. Among the most minimal of its programs is the London Six Night Special, a land-only program that includes airport transfers and Continental breakfast. It starts at $190 for accommodations at the President Hotel in Russell Square; for $367, you can stay at the statelier Grosvenor Hotel on Buckingham Palace Road. (The Grosvenor, near Victoria Station, is not to be confused with Grosvenor House, the deluxe hotel on Park Lane.) If you were to book these hotels yourself, without buying a package, six nights at the President with breakfast and airport transfers would cost about $300 a person, based on two in a room; at the Grosvenor Hotel, $630.
The Historic London package, which combines air fare with accommodations, starts at $629 for six nights at the Tavistock near Russell Square, and includes Continental breakfast, transfers and entertainment vouchers. Accommodations at the St. Giles Hotel near the British Museum, cost $727; a stay at the Grosvenor near Victoria Station is $823. Using British Airways' $379 fare, an independently designed package would cost about $685 with accommodations at the Tavistock, $860 for the St. Giles and $1,035 for the Grosvenor.
The airline will also book rooms at about 60 centrally situated London hotels on a per-night basis. The Strand Palace near Covent Garden costs $58 a person, including English breakfast (compared with $94 a person if purchased independently); the most expensive listing, the luxurious Grosvenor House near Hyde Park, is $138 (compared with $200) with full English breakfast.
American Airlines, (800) 832-8383), has a London a La Carte program, a six-night land package that includes transfers, Continental breakfast, a London bus tour and a cruise on the River Thames. The program starts at $191 for accommodations in the Harewood in Marylebone (compared with $418, including the cost of tours, transfers and the hotel's listed rates for room and breakfast). Rooms at the White House near Regent's Park are $259 (compared with $633, including the cost of all features); $285 at the Drury Lane Moat House near Covent Garden (compared with $630 for four weekday and two weekend nights), and $403 at the Strand Palace near Covent Garden (compared with $585). Travelers should note the conditions attached to these bookings. They must reserve their hotel at the same time as the flight, or there is a $99 surcharge. There's also a $15 surcharge unless one books a room more than 31 days before departure.
Europe Express, (212) 334-0836, a two-and-a-half-year-old company based in New York, is offering a $469 air and land package, using USAir as the carrier. While this package may eventually change if USAir raises its trans-Atlantic fares, Mr. Ford, the company's president, says another, virtually identical program with British Airways, costing $499, will not change. The lowest rates for both packages are for accommodations in less expensive hotels that include the Norfolk Towers near Paddington Station. (Booking the components independently, using the hotel's listed rates and USAir's $306 connecting flight and British Airways' $379 fare, the price would be, respectively, $702 and $775.)
Six nights at the Norfolk in South Kensington costs $569 with USAir and $599 with British Airways. (The comparison cost is $964 for two weekend nights and four weekdays at the Norfolk, using USAir; $1,037 when using British Airways.)
Europe Express also offers a la carte prices at 28 London hotels, with Continental breakfast. While the company will not guarantee the quality of the room, Mr. Ford says that Travco, the London company that helps make land arrangements for his packages, will find clients more suitable accommodations if they are not satisfied.
Travel Bound, (212) 334-1350 or (800) 456-8656, which is based in New York and has been in operation since 1982, uses Virgin Atlantic Airways for its Royal Londoner package. The package includes a cream tea at Self ridge's department store, and Continental breakfast, and starts at $449 for six nights at the Barkston Hotel off Earl's Court Road; $549 will put you in the Forte Crest near Regent's Park. (Booked independently and using Virgin Atlantic, the trip would cost $765 at the Barkston and $894 at the Forte Crest Regents Park.) A similar package, using Continental Air Lines, is slightly more expensive, starting at $499.
These rates, according to Mr. Johnson of Travel Bound, will not be affected by any further currency fluctuations or change in air fares.
Travel Bound also has a selection of 25 hotels that can be booked on a nightly basis. The Drury Lane Moat House is $69 a night, with breakfast, compared with $107 if paying the hotel's weekday rate for room and breakfast. No minimum stay is required.

HEADLINE: PROBLEMS WE THOUGHT WE SOLVED

 BODY:
The first paragraph of Perri Klass's article "Tackling Problems We Thought We Solved" (Dec. 13), where she describes the unnecessary death of a 9-month-old baby from dehydrating diarrhea for lack of a $6 bottle of rehydrating solution, captures just about everything that ails our health-care system: the lack of basic primary care for mothers and children; the high cost of simple remedies that put them out of reach of poor families; the lack of outreach, education and community support; the underlying poverty. For those of us who work on health issues in the developing world, it is a reminder of how important our work is and how relevant to the needs of American children.
Worldwide, more than three million children die every year from diarrhea, most of them in countries where the annual per capita spending on all health care is less than the price of that one prescription for Pedialyte. 
 Despite such grim financial realities, enormous progress has been made in the developing world. In her home country of El Salvador, the mother of that infant might very well have been instructed to make a mixture of household sugar, salt and water that would have prevented her infant's death. It is time to apply at home some of the lessons learned internationally.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Architects Now On Board;
Huge L.I. Federal Court Complex

 BODY:
With the choice of Richard Meier and Michael Harris Spector as architects of the $195 million Federal Building and United States Courthouse planned in Islip, L.I., the Government has shown that it is not looking for a neo-classical temple with fluted columns and pediments. Mr. Meier, in particular, is widely known for the spare serenity of his designs: crisp, cool, bright and uncluttered.
"This will be a contemporary, modern court complex," Mr. Spector declared. "That's what we presented as our philosophy and what's been accepted by the General Services Administration and the judiciary." 
 William J. Diamond, the regional administrator of the General Services Administration, said the project would be the first major Federal complex ever built on Long Island and a "fantastic shot in the arm" for the local economy.
The 450,000-square-foot office and courthouse project is to rise on a 24.7-acre site at North Spur Drive and Carleton Avenue, beginning in 1995. It is expected to take three years to build. There will be 21 courtrooms in the new building.
Two weeks ago, the Government chose the Spector Group of North Hills, L.I., as architects, working in association with Richard Meier & Partners of Manhattan.
"The whole idea," Mr. Diamond said, "is to build something there that will be of architectural high quality."
Mr. Meier said the project would be his first important civic building for a public client in the United States. "There was a point when Federal buildings were considered in this country to be among the most important, prestigious works of architecture," Mr. Meier said. "I believe there are people in the Government who feel that very strongly again."

HEADLINE: Perspectives: The New York Gains Tax;
An Added Weight on a Struggling Market

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
THE tax collectors of New York State sat happily in the 80's in a cart pulled by a frisky horse, the active market in real-estate sales. They collected hundreds of millions of dollars from a tax that no other jurisdiction decided to levy -- 10 percent of the gain on sales of more than $1 million.
But the horse has staggered. And as the gains tax enters its second decade, it has become an element in retarding recovery, inarguably so in the case of workouts of troubled properties. 
 The long-term effect is likely to be the inhibition of the development of new co-ops and condominiums and the sale of commercial real estate, often a prelude to investment in property improvements. At present the tax is primarily interfering with workouts of troubled property. It also routinely complicates corporate sales when real estate is a major asset. That these consequences would follow a turn in the cycle was widely predicted even before the tax was adopted as a budgetary expedient in 1983. But upward momentum in the market made it an irresistible revenue-raiser for state government.
In an interview last month, James W. Wetzler, the state's Commissioner of Taxation and Finance, said that no consideration was being given to repealing the tax. He said that it was "never designed for a period when real estate is depressed" and was "creating notable problems." But it will raise about $110 million this fiscal year, ending March 31, based on current transaction levels, he said. It will be the sixth year of declining revenue since the $792 million peak of fiscal 1987.
The focus now is on making the tax liability conform more closely to real economic gain, Mr. Wetzler said. A good case has been made for changing the way the tax applies in workouts, he said. It has complicated workouts because would-be sellers find themselves liable for tax on properties on which they lost money.
Conversion sponsors seeking to rid themselves of co-op apartments are a notable case in point. Another concerns developers of newly built office buildings, or developers who in the 80's purchased existing buildings planning major renovations and re-leasing.
There have been some reforms. Co-op corporations don't have to pay the tax when sponsor-owned shares are seized because of defaults in maintenance payments. And under a one-year "targeted penalty abatement program," interest-payment penalties for late payers or underpayers have been waived. In foreclosures, lenders taking back property don't have to pay the tax to record a deed. But the former owner is still liable for the tax.
There are many reasons beyond the gains tax -- nicknamed the Cuomo tax in the real-estate world -- for the drop in real-estate sales activity in the state. But if owners are discouraged from selling because of tax consequences, if buyers start to discount possible future taxes from what they are willing to pay and if developers are discouraged from risk-taking, the economy of the state will suffer, property owners and lenders say.
"The tax has definitely had a negative impact on real estate in New York," said Joseph A. DeLuca, executive vice president of the real estate group of Chemical Bank.
"It's just one more good reason for keeping away from New York," said William Zeckendorf Jr., a major condominium builder in the 80's. He said he considers the tax a gross sales tax rather than a gains tax, because builders and converters are not allowed to consider many of the key soft costs of development as part of the cost basis used for calculating the gain.
These costs include interest on site-acquisition loans; the cost of carrying unsold space after construction; marketing and advertising expenses; the expense, in Manhattan, of buying Section 421a tax abatement certificates to enhance affordability to buyers; leasing-up expenses; brokerage commissions for leasing; tenant relocation expenses and marketing and advertising costs.
"THE tax is a significant hardship," said Jan Nicholson, vice president of Citicorp Real Estate. "Because of the problems, we will be much more cautious about making real estate loans in New York." In default situations it inhibits borrowers from working with their lender, she said, and it has been a major problem for condominium development as well.
The problem for lenders is that the tax has impeded their ability to negotiate expeditious takeovers of real estate from defaulting condominium and office builders, conversion sponsors and owners of commercial property generally. Technically, the tax is based on the difference between what the state determines is the "consideration" (what the seller derives from the sale) and what it considers to be the "original purchase price," the basis from which the gain is calculated.
In a transfer in lieu of foreclosure, the consideration has been taken to reflect what is owed rather than what a property is currently worth in the marketplace. This can produce a large tax liability for a borrower already facing an economic loss, leaving defaulting borrowers unwilling to transfer deeds back to lenders. Lenders are obliged to go through long and costly foreclosure procedures, while the debt mounts and buildings cannot compete effectively for tenants.
Some lawyers and accountants think that the Department of Taxation and Finance may have pointed a way out of this situation in an advisory opinion issued late last month. It says the state will accept fair-market value, rather than debt owed, as the consideration when there is a transfer of a controlling interest in an entity in which real estate is one of the assets.
The opinion was issued to accountants at Deloitte & Touche. The firm's senior tax manager, William H. Korman, said it opens the door to partnership or stock acquisitions by lenders, rather than asset acquisitions, as a way of avoiding the gains tax in transfers to a lender after default.
Tax lawyers representing owners contend the statute itself is explicit that the measure of the gains tax in a controlling-interest transfer is the real estate's fair-market value. But there had been no explicit confirmation until the new advisory opinion.
As much as the gains tax has been a problem in workouts, its long-term effect is greatest on real-estate activity generally -- decisions on whether to buy or sell and the availability of mortgage loans.
Existing commercial properties that need new capital and new leadership will find it harder to come by them, real estate professionals say. Long-term owners, facing extraordinary gains taxes because of the law's failure to provide for updating basis to account for inflation, are less likely to sell.
Risk-taking buyers who need to borrow new capital, improve buildings and look for new tenants are likely to lower their expectations of what the property will be worth if their efforts succeed. They will therefore be willing to pay less to buy.
"The state does not respect bottom-fisher costs," said Carolyn Lee Ichel, a lawyer at Roberts & Holland.
Nor does it respect the economic losses of risk-takers. Jeffrey R. Gural, president of Newmark & Company Real Estate, a management company whose principals bought Class B Manhattan buildings in the 80's, told of paying a tax of $1 million on a downtown building that was purchased half empty for $50 million, improved, rented up and sold two years later for $70 million.
"Our total cost was $70 million," he said, "but the state said we made a $10 million profit." Among other things, $5 million in interest on the acquisition loan was not allowed as part of the basis for calculating gain.
In Albany, some of the most contentious issues have been adjudicated by the state's three-member Tax Appeals Tribunal, an independent division of the Department of Taxation and Finance. Its president, John P. Dugan, said that the tribunal's decision that the "cost of carry in a soft market doesn't reduce the amount of consideration subject to gain" had been confirmed by the Appellate Division of state Supreme Court.
"It's a tough law," Mr. Dugan said, noting that the state Legislature passed it in 1983 as the "budget closer" expecting it to produce $85 million in taxes. In fact, it far exceeded those expectations.
However, some of the activities that produced those revenues are now extinct, and under current Federal tax law are unlikely to revive even in an improvement in the sales market. Conversions of rentals to co-ops and condominiums are one. In 1990 the state assessed $46 million on sponsors of co-op conversions, for example. There were $37 million of assessments on newly built condominiums, for which taxes are due as aggregate sales reach $1 million.
Such development activity -- especially in New York City, where multifamily property is involved -- seems far less likely in the future. The gains tax is a significant reason.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Manhattan Office Leasing;
A Glow at the End of the Tunnel?

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
IT'S not exactly a rebound. And if it's a light at the end of the tunnel, it's no more than a 40-watt bulb. But it looks like maybe, just maybe, the end of 1992 will be remembered as the cheer-up point for the depressed midtown market.
Vacancy rates were down and rents slowed their precipitous slide. 
 Tenants started exercising options to expand and some brokers report that concession packages -- free rent, build-out money and the like -- were getting smaller, too.
"I'm not saying landlords aren't hurting, or that rents are going up at more than a creep, or that New York should expect huge increases in tax revenues from commercial buildings any time soon,"said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. "But the fact is, midtown leasing activity is way, way up."
December numbers aren't all compiled yet, but the data that emerged through November show reasons for cheer.
The Edward S. Gordon Company, for example, reported that in the first 11 months of 1992 nearly 2 million square feet of midtown space were absorbed; in the same period last year, more than 3 million were added to an already glutted market. That absorption brought the midtown vacancy rate, Gordon says, down to 16.8 percent (or 31.9 million feet), from 17.6 percent (33.3 million feet) for the same time last year.
But such statistics, while plentiful -- many large brokerages issue quarterly market reports -- are not definitive. Most are based on anecodotal evidence or surveys of landlords and buildings deemed, often arbitrarily, to be representative.
Space absorption figures are particularly problematic. They rarely take into account space that, while officially occupied, is available for sublease. And, if a tenant signs a lease for, say, 100,000 feet effective in 1994, that space is immediately subtracted from the market availability list. But the space the tenant currently occupies often is not added to the market figures until the tenant moves. So while the future space and current space should cancel each other out statistically, in fact the space shuffling often shows up as another 100,000 feet of space absorbed.
If brokers don't agree on the numbers, they certainly agree on the direction those numbers are pointing: Up.
"The first part of 1992 was all about tenants dragging their feet in negotiations," said Bruce Mosler, vice chairman of the Galbreath Riverbank brokerage. "But the end of 1992 was about making real commitments."
Brokers cite many factors behind the new buoyancy. High on most lists is pent-up demand for space. In the last few years, many tenants held off looking for new space, waiting to see if rents would drop even further. Finally, many could hold out no longer; their existing leases were too close to expiration.
Other tenants, with less time pressure, jumped in when they felt that no stronger deals could be found.
"For two years no one wanted to commit to space," said Barry Gosin, president of Newmark Real Estate Services. "Now corporate chairmen have decided the market has hit bottom and it's time to negotiate."
And many tenants finally felt more secure about their own businesses and their ability to expand. Big accounting concerns like Price Waterhouse and Ernst & Young took extra space scarcely months after the ink on their new leases had dried. And many tenants signed long-term leases, in part to lock in bargains, but also in part because they had decided to tough it out in New York.
"Long leases don't have an immediate impact on vacancies, but they send the right signal about New York," said William M. Korchak, director of leasing for Compass Management & Leasing, part of Equitable Real Estate Investment Management.
For large tenants, in fact, there was a sense of impending scarcity amidst the glut, a belief that they had better grab large blocks of space now, lest they not be available later.
"NO ONE expects any speculative building any time soon," said James S. Vanderslice, managing director of Cushman & Wakefield.
Mergers, particularly among banks, will release space, of course. Bank of America, which merged with Security Pacific, will probably move to Security Pacific Plaza at 40 East 52d Street, vacating some 300,000 feet at 355 Madison Avenue, near 45th. And brokers expect Chemical Bank to free 900,000 feet of space at 277 Park Avenue, near 48th Street, in 1994, and consolidate with its merger partner, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, across the street at 270 Park Avenue.
"The space is being quietly shopped around, but there's a 50-50 chance that it will hit the market empty," said Michael T. Cohen, president of Williams Real Estate.
Still, most brokers expect a net shrinkage in marketable blocks of large space. Americas Towers, the city's newest and highest-profile building, is rapidly being leased. Smith Barney will probably buy 1585 Broadway and use much of it itself, taking that building off the market.
Paramount is looking for several hundred thousand feet somewhere in midtown. Metropolitan Life, which bought the Pan Am building at 200 Park Avenue, will occupy at least 210,000 feet itself, even though other tenants showed definite interest in the space.
"We had a live tenant looking for more than 100,000 feet of space, that we simply couldn't get in there," said Steven B. Siegel, Gordon's chief executive.
For landlords, it has meant a new sense of empowerment. Brokers report that while large tenants can still pretty well get whatever they want, smaller tenants no longer can count on an automatic year's free rent or $45 a foot in work. They may get them, but they have to bargain much harder for them.
"It's still a tenant's market, but the footing is a bit more equal now," said Mr. Spinola.
Of course, there have been losers.
THERE'S been a flight to quality as tenants find they can rent luxury space in Class A buildings for what, barely three years ago, would have put them in cramped, Class B quarters. Cushman & Wakefield notes that in the third quarter of 1992 vacancy rates in Class A buildings had dropped to 16 percent, from 16.7 percent in the second quarter. But vacancies in Class B buildings held stubbornly at 19.9 percent.
Moreover, some brokers predict more foreclosures. Once free rent, build-out work and other costs are factored in, top-of-the-line midtown space seems to have bottomed out at about $35 a foot.
"That's just not enough to support a lot of the debt that these buildings took on in the 80's," warned Mr. Cohen of Williams.
And much of midtown's gain was at downtown's expense.
"There's a real tale of two cities here," said Randal Fuchs, director of marketing and research for Joseph Hilton & Associates. "We're seeing tenants moving uptown, simply shuffling space."
One example: Bank of Tokyo moved out of about 150,000 feet at 100 Broadway, in the Wall Street area, to similar space at 1251 Avenue of the Americas, near 51st Street.
Still, even downtown may have reason for some cheer. As midtown tightens up, some tenants will have to look downtown. Mr. Siegel reports that one publishing company that is now in prime midtown space is looking downtown. And there is talk that the city may provide incentives for converting more than 5 million feet of antiquated downtown office space to residential use, which would automatically tighten up the market.
No one is suggesting that midtown's problems are over. Midtown is a headquarters area, and even if the economy recovers, corporations are unlikely to restore the layers of executive jobs they cut in the 1980's. Moreover, most of the leasing activity in 1992 was from companies that already had space.
"The city still has to find a way to provide incentives for new tenants to walk in here," warned Mr. Mosler of Galbraith Riverbank.
All in all, though, most brokers entered 1993 with buoyant spirits.
"As everything seemed to be recovering in 1992, my main question was, 'Would this last through 1993?' " said Gordon's Mr. Siegel. "Now, I think it will."
Even those who think that talk of recovery is premature express a certain optimism.
"Large corporations are still downsizing, Wall Street isn't hiring, but small businesses are picking up the slack," said Newmark's Mr. Gosin. "The next couple years won't be a bed of roses, but nothing will get worse."

HEADLINE: New L.I. Faces In Congress Mean a Loss Of Influence

BYLINE: By States News Service

 BODY:
TWO years ago, Long Island's representatives in Congress had worked their way up in the seniority system to gain a fair amount of influence in the House.
Representatives Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of West Islip, and Raymond J. McGrath, Republican of Valley Stream, sat on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. Representative Robert J. Mrazek, Democrat of Huntington, helped dispense money as a member of the Appropriations Committee. Norman F. Lent, Republican of Baldwin with 22 years in the House, helped influence issues important to Long Island, like fishing and other water-related problems, with his seat on the Merchant Marines and Fisheries Committee. Mr. Lent also sat on the investigative Energy and Commerce Committee. 
 But redistricting and the election in November changed the face of the delegation. Mr. Lent and Mr. McGrath announced early on that they were retiring. Mr. Mrazek bowed out after an abortive primary bid for the Senate, and redistricting shaved a seat from the Island's representation. A tight election felled nine-term Mr. Downey, and redistricting moved Representative Gary L. Ackerman, Democrat of Forest Hills, solidly into Nassau County.
As a result the five-member delegation now includes three first-year members and one new member to the Island in addition to Representative George Hochbrueckner, Democrat of Centereach.
Long Island lawmakers say there is no question that the changes leave the group less influential.
"I don't think anybody can deny we've lost an awful lot of years in seniority," said Representative David Levy, Republican of Baldwin. Mr. Levy represents the redrawn 4th District, previously in Mr. McGrath and Mr. Lent's territory.
"You take Norm out and Ray, a high-ranking Republican for 18 years, and Tom Downey, who was in the majority on Ways and Means -- clearly, that's a tremendous loss of clout which cannot be made up for many years to come," said Mr. Hochbrueckner, who will be returning for his fourth term.
 
'The Landscape Has Changed'
 "Those bridges of trust take some time to develop," said Rick Lazio, Republican of Brightwaters, who defeated Mr. Downey. "I know I'm not going to get everything done in the first six months or first year or even the first term."
Further hampering the effectiveness is the party affiliation of the first-year members. All three are Republicans in a Democratically controlled House as a Democratic President prepares to take office.
"I am acutely aware of the fact that the landscape has changed," Mr. Lazio said. "Speaking for myself, I need to be a little bit quicker and smarter. It means I need to develop good personal relationships with Democrats as well as Republicans."
Representative Peter King, Republican of Seaford, said the votes of his party colleagues' would have meant much more if President Bush were returning for a second term. "With a Democratic President, there's no question that that takes away a lot of leverage," he said. "Sure, I'm going to miss that."
But new and old members alike maintain that Island voters are not doomed to years of lost projects and less money. Although the delegation is rife with neophyte lawmakers, the sheer size of the Class of '92 in Congress -- 110 new members, nearly a quarter of the House -- means that the first-year members are not starting from the same back benches that most current members did.
"I think it makes it easier to get in the game quickly," Mr. Hochbrueckner said. "The organization and the institution that you have to cozy up to is smaller. When I came in there were something like 35 new members and 400 old ones This year there is less there to work on in terms of cracking the system."
He and Mr. King said the proportions of the class would allow the group to be somewhat of a voting bloc. "I don't expect to be able to walk in right away and be Norman Lent," Mr. King said. "But with so many new members we become almost a swing vote. I think it's up to me and the other new members to exercise that swing vote."
"As a class they have a lot of clout," Mr. Hochbrueckner said. "I think you'll find a lot of senior types will be more willing to work with the freshmen."
Other longtime members like Mr. Ackerman were less enthusiastic. "There's a little bit of naivete there," he said. "In order to get things done you have to get coalitions. The power structure is based on seniority, and there's going to be coalitions built within all levels of the pyramid. If they're counting on functioning as a cohesive freshman group, that's not going to work. It's going to break down into regions and committees."
 
Can the Bacon Still Be Harvested?
 Many politicians agree that the success of the first-year members from Long Island will largely depend on how far the White House and the Democratic leadership in Congress extends a hand to the minority.
"It depends on the partisan shift," said Herbert Rosenbaum, a professor of political science at Hofstra University. "The Long Island constituents have been very carefully taught that their representatives are the ambassadors to bring home the bacon. Whether they can do that depends on the leadership in the White House and how much leeway the new President gives the Republicans."
Nevertheless, the Long Island lawmakers said the delegation planned to work together to push projects for the region. The group, with a full schedule of plans, met a few times between Election Day and the official swearing-in, on Jan. 5.
"We're going to try to get up to speed for the people of Long Island," Mr. Ackerman said. "Regardless of political affiliation, that's the only way to go. We've talked about the economy and the loss of jobs on Long Island. We met jointly with Grumman to discuss the problems there."
 
Important Committee Assignments
 Mr. Hochbrueckner said the conversion of military industries and other programs to help displaced workers topped his agenda. Mr. King said that as a member of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries panel he would work to find money to combat beach erosion and other destruction caused by major storms.
Helping the group are the committee assignments. Mr. King, Mr. Lazio and Mr. Levy did not receive their first choices, Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce. But their assignments were among their top requests.
Mr. Levy was assigned to the Foreign Affairs and Public Works Committees. He said that he did not have a specific agenda, but that he was pleased that the Foreign Affairs panel would let him to address issues dealing with Israel. "I have a large constituency in my district that is interested in matters involving Israel," he said. "I'll be dealing with that."
 
To Fight 'Regulatory Morass'
 Mr. Lazio, who received seats on the Banking and Budget committees, said he hoped to review the "regulatory morass" that he says is keeping banks from lending money and stifling the recovery from the recession. "I think if we can carefully scrutinize regulations that have been or about to be implemented and eliminate some of those that are ill advised," Mr. Lazio said. "We can pump billions of dollars into the economy without raising taxes or increasing the deficit."
He will be joined on the Banking committee by Mr. King, who replaces Mr. Lent on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. "That committee serves in a watchdog role," Mr. King said. "My district includes all of the South Shore and some of the North Shore. So of course while there, I'll work to protect the fishing industry" in addition to finding money to repair storm damage.

HEADLINE: New College Loan Rules Take Effect

BYLINE: States News Service

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS a senior at John Jay High School in Katonah, Amanda Arpino had her heart set on Ripon College in Wisconsin. But her mother, Carol, could not afford the $18,000 yearly cost, and she knew her $70,000 income and $240,000 condominium would keep her daughter from qualifying for Federal aid. They didn't even bother filling out the loan forms. Ripon offered a scholarship, but it wasn't enough.
Amanda settled for the State University of New York at Binghamton, a much larger college that fit into Carol's $6,000 yearly school budget. 
 Now the Federal Government is loosening its loan rules to make it easier for middle-class students to pay for college. That is good news for some families, but educators worry that the relaxed rules will encourage students and parents to take on more debt than they can afford.
The Arpinos aren't giving into the temptation. Although the new rules would put Ripon's expensive education within Amanda Arpino's reach, she and her mother decided that the debt -- $12,000 a year -- would be more than they could handle.
 
Three Major Loan Programs
 Although many people think of grants when they think of student aid, for years most of the help from the Federal Government came in the form of federally guaranteed low-interest bank loans available through three major programs. The largest is the subsidized Stafford loan program, which allows low-income students to borrow for college or graduate school.
There is also the Supplemental Loans for Students program, which lets any student, regardless of income, take out a small Government-guaranteed bank loan, and the Plus Loan, which lets parents get low-interest loans to pay for their child's college education. Unlike the other two, Stafford is a subsidized loan, which means the Government makes the student's interest payments so long as he or she stays in school.
The revised Higher Education Act, signed into law last summer, makes dozens of changes to existing grant and loan programs. Four changes, in particular, are expected to increase student borrowing in Westchester.
 
Borrowing Becomes Easier
 First, the act creates a new non-need-based Stafford loan. Every student in America is eligible for the loans, which are now available to pay for the semester starting this month. The loans offer low-interest rates but are considered unsubsidized because the Government doesn't cover the initial interest payments. Banks will continue lending money to low-income students through the regular subsidized Stafford program.
Second, the law loosens the Federal formula that decides who gets student aid and how much. Specifically, the Government will stop counting home equity when it determines how much families can borrow under need-based programs like the regular Stafford.
Third, it removes lending limits from the Plus program, letting parents borrow up to the full cost of a child's education. Under the old law, parents were able to borrow only $4,000 a year.
Fourth, the law increases the size of most Stafford loans, increasing lifetime limits for undergraduates to $23,000 from $17,250. It also raises the limits for graduate school Stafford borrowing, to $8,500 a year from $7,500. The limits for upperclassmen on Supplemental Loans for Students will also increase.
 
Embracing the Middle Class
 One of the goals of the changes was to "embrace the middle class in student-aid programs," said John Curtice, director of financial services at the State University's central administration office in Albany. The new law helps families that can "stomach the loans" to pay for college, he said.
When students hear the words "financial aid" they tend to imagine grants and scholarships, not loans, said Kathleen Payea, associate director of financial services at College Scholarship Service, the Manhattan-based student-aid arm of the nonprofit organization called the College Board, which is best known for administering standardized tests. Ms. Payea said the new law has raised expectations that won't be met.
One has a choice between having a loan and not being able to pay for college at all, countered Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of Harrison, a member of the House Education and Labor Committee and a supporter of the law. "The role of the Government is to provide access and opportunity for all youngsters, but the individual decision to take on that debt has to be the individual's."
The Arpinos are better off financially than the typical Westchester family, but their home is worth less than the average home in the county. As a supervisor of guidance and business education at Woodlands High School, Carol Arpino makes $70,000 a year, above the 1990 county median of $58,862 for a family. Her Cross River town house, which she bought for $240,000 five years ago, cost less than the median of $283,500. But as a divorced mother working off a nearly new mortgage and paying for her daughter's education on her own, her finances are tighter than most family's. She can only afford to spend $6,000 a year on her daughter's college education.
Still, they are among the middle- class people that the rule changes were designed to help, and a look at the way the new rules could help pay for Amanda Arpino's education could offer some guidance for other Westchester families.
 
Below-Market Interest Rate
 With the new non-need-based Stafford Loans becoming available this month, Amanda Arpino, a sophomore in college, will be able to borrow $2,625. As with a regular need-based Stafford, her money will be lent by banks at a below-market interest rate, and the Government will guarantee that the bank is paid back. Because her loan won't come from the old subsidized program, Amanda Arpino won't get Government help with the early interest payments.
Amanda Arpino's new $2,625 loan will bring her closer to a semester at Ripon but won't get her to the school, which costs about $9,000 a term.
Having already spent about $2,000 on college for this school year, Carol Arpino could contribute about $4,000 for Ripon. That would still leave Amanda Arpino $2,000 short of Ripon's single semester cost.
In Westchester, the unsubsidized program could generate close to 10,000 new loans, giving area students $24 million in new funds, said Charles Treadwell, director of research policy at the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation, the company that will insure most of those loans. Mr. Treadwell couldn't say exactly who will borrow the unsubsidized funds, but a similar Pennsylvania program gives out most of its loans to families who make $30,000 to $54,000 a year, according to the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, which insures that state's student loans.
 
Home Equity to Be Removed
 Next fall Amanda Arpino's loan package could improve again, when the Government relaxes the eligibility rules for need-based aid, raises the Stafford loan limits and removes the limits on how much Carol Arpino can borrow under the Plus program.
Under the relaxed Stafford borrowing rules, the Government won't count home equity or other assets when it decides how much a family should contribute to its child's education. The Government figures out how much aid to give each student by subtracting the family's share from the cost of the school. The Government covers its share, ranging from $2,625 for freshmen to $8,500 for graduate students, through loan programs, and most schools try to pick up the rest of the tab.
Nationwide, the new rules will reduce the amount families put in by an average of about $700, said Ms. Payea of the College Scholarship Service. Homeowners will benefit the most. Their share will drop an average of $1,500 while most renters will see their tuition share increase, she said.
Together, the new Stafford and Plus rules would make it possible for Amanda Arpino to spend her junior and senior years at Ripon.
 
To Go Into Debt or Not?
 Under the new formula, the Government will require Carol Arpino to put about $15,000 (in cash or loans) toward her daughter's education, according to rough calculations made by Ms. Payea. Subtract that $15,000 from Ripon's $18,000 annual cost, and that leaves Amanda Arpino eligible for $3,000 in need-based aid. The Government would probably offer Amanda Arpino a $3,000 subsidized Stafford to cover the Government's share.
But Carol Arpino can only afford to contribute $6,000 a year, so that will leave the family with a $9,000 annual gap. Amanda Arpino can fill part of that gap by borrowing another $2,500 from the new unsubsidized Stafford program in each of her last two years of college. That will still leave the Arpinos $6,500 short each year. Carol Arpino can take up that slack with a $6,500 Plus loan or Amanda Arpino can borrow $5,000 under the Supplemental Loans for Students program while her mother borrows $1,500 from Plus. Amanda Arpino works part time and contributes something to the cost of her education.
But for the Arpinos, the total debt for two years at Ripon would still be about $24,000. The question for them and other Westchester families is whether the exclusive private school education is worth the debt.
The answer for the Arpinos is no. After college, Armanda Arpino said, she plans to earn both business and law degrees. She expects her graduate education to put her $100,000 in debt and she says that any undergraduate loans are out of the question. For other families the answer may be different.
 
 
 
COLLEGES DOUBT THEY CAN GIVE MORE HELP

 
 NEXT fall, new Federal lending rules will reduce the amount that middle-class families must put toward college and increase Government contributions. The new rules will also leave a larger financial gap for colleges to cover. Financial-aid officers at several colleges say they can't afford to fill that new gap. Instead, they are coming up with their own formulas. Here is how several are coping:
Sarah Lawrence in Yonkers can't afford to use the new Federal formula, said Robert M. Kinnally, the school's director of financial aid. Instead, the school is using an aid formula developed by the College Scholarship Service, the student-aid arm of the nonprofit College Board, the group that administers standardized admissions tests.
Mr. Kinnally described the College Scholarship formula as an affordable compromise between the new and old Federal formulas that will "keep our budget intact and keep our families as happy as possible."
Under the old Federal formula, the Government included the full value of a family's home when it determined how much that family would have tocontribute to college costs -- and how much was left over for the Federal Government to contribute. Under the new Federal formula, the Government doesn't consider home value at all. Using the College Scholarship formula, Sarah Lawrence will look at part of a family's home value -- up to three times the family's income -- when it decides how to distribute its funds. In other ways the College Scholarship formula follows the new Federal formula, Mr. Kinnally said.
Though Sarah Lawrence is changing its aid formula in an effort to keep up with the Federal changes, Mr. Kinnally said he expects the college's new formula to yield just about the same dollar amounts as the old one. "We think it's going to be some kind of a wash," he said. "It has to be."
Sarah Lawrence now gives out about $5 million of its grant money every year. That figure can't go up much, Mr. Kinnally said, because the extra money isn't there. If using the new College Scholarship formula results in higher costs than using the old method, Sarah Lawrence will have to rethink the way it disburses funds, Mr. Kinnally said.
Vassar College in Poughkeepsie would have to spend $1.5 million to $2 million of its own money this fall to finance all the middle-class students the Federal Government now says are eligible. The college just doesn't have the extra cash, said Michael Fraher, the director of financial aid.
"Basically, we're going to continue to use the old formula" to distribute Vassar funds, Mr. Fraher said. Students who are already getting aid from Vassar will get the same package in the 1993-94 school year. And students who are not eligible for Vassar money now won't qualify for it in the future.
At Pace University, using the new formula would also cost millions of dollars, said Leo Kornfeld, vice president of enrollment management. But the university, which already puts 15 percent of its tuition income into grants and scholarships, will not be able to increase its grant budget by millions, he said.
"We have never, nor can we ever meet the needs of all the students who come to Pace," he said. Pace will continue to allocate its limited scholarship dollars by helping the best students first, he said.
The new Federal rules are not going to change the financial-aid picture at Mercy College, said Marion Dale, the school's director of financial aid. The school offers some merit-based scholarships, but its largest aid program offers grants to students whose family income is less than $15,000 a year, Miss Dale said. The Dobbs Ferry college can't afford to expand its program to include the middle class, she said.
Similarly, Iona College will not offer new grants. "There's no way a school with our endowment can meet all the need," said Monica Simotas, Iona's director of financial aid. "My budget for financial aid is not going to be increased."

Bright Forecasts for the Far East

BYLINE: By Sheryl WuDunn

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
The Hong Kong stock market's stellar performance last year might have stunned and dazzled overseas investors, but local investors are grumbling.
They are distressed that nearly half the gains they scored when the Hang Seng index hit a record in mid-November were erased in December. From a high of 6,570.83, the index tumbled by year's end to 5,512.39. Still, that was up 28.3 percent for the entire year, the highest growth of all the world's markets. 
 Volatility is a way of life in the Hong Kong market, where fortunes and failures are intricately linked to the political winds of mainland China, particularly to the activities of a small group of octogenarians who with a single grunt or a smile on television can send ripples through the market. Last year, economic optimism in Hong Kong surged because China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, visited the country's southern region to dramatize the need for faster economic growth and more capitalist-style changes.
Business executives and traders scurry back and forth between the territory and the mainland, agonizing over risky opportunities that boast of doubling their capital in a couple of years.
Once dismissed as a far-away market that ignored fundamentals, Hong Kong is now attracting growing numbers of overseas investors -- Americans, in particular. With the Hong Kong dollar pegged to the American dollar at a rate of 7.8 to 1, Americans face little currency risk.
Hong Kong's link with China -- once viewed as negative by investors who feared the territory would be swallowed up by China in 1997 -- increasingly is seen as an advantage. Investors eager to cash in on China's economic boom see the Hong Kong market as a China play offering a more orderly environment than Chinese stocks themselves.
Indeed, the pendulum has swung so far that many brokers have criticized Hong Kong's new governor, Christopher Patten, for introducing democracy proposals that offended China. A bitter denunciation by Chinese authorities caused Hong Kong stocks to plunge in the last six weeks of 1992.
"Can you believe it?" asked a Chinese business executive with interests in Hong Kong. "The Communists and the capitalists are on the same side against democracy?"
This year Hong Kong's economy is expected to remain buoyant as it prepares to enter the Year of the Rooster, mostly on the coattails of China's economic boom, and some analysts expect the market to set records again. Price/earnings ratios for Hang Seng index stocks in 1992 were about 11-to-1, and some analysts project that based on prospects for high corporate earnings for this year, that even with higher prices the ratio will drop to 9-to-1.
Still, the contretemps over Mr. Patten's pro-democracy proposals overshadows the market. China reiterated a few days ago that it would not accept the proposals, nor would it compromise. Mr. Patten submits his proposals next month to the Legislative Council, and talks could drag on for weeks and even months.
A secondary concern is Washington. Some fear that President-elect Bill Clinton and the Democrat-controlled Congress will attach conditions to United States trade benefits to China. Such worries could damp the usual optimism and flurry of investment that precedes the Chinese New Year on Jan. 23.
The market closed Friday at 5,529.56, down 17.76 points from Thursday's close.
Other Asian markets, notably Malaysia and Thailand, also showed handsome gains last year. Only three years after spinning off from a partnership with Singapore, the Kuala Lumpur Composite Index closed at 643.96, up 15.8 percent last year, compared with a 4.2 percent rise for the Dow Jones industrial average.
Prospects for this year are also somewhat rosy. Malaysia's economy, with real growth last year of 8.5 percent over 1991, is Asia's fastest growing next to China. This year, after several years of impressive growth, economists predict a lower but still healthy growth rate of about 7 to 8 percent.
"There has to be some sort of consolidation if nothing else just to cope with the slow economy we are seeing in Western countries and the domestic bottlenecks," said Paul S. B. Chan, head of research at OCBC Securities (Melaka) Sdn Berhad, in Kuala Lumpur. "All these are converging around this time, so I think it will lead to a slower rate of growth for equity prices as well."
Analysts say the index could rise to 700 or 750 by the end of the year, and that prices could be 15 to 20 times 1993 earnings.
Thailand's stock market surprised investors by pulling itself out of a deep slump brought on by an attempted coup. The SET index ended the year at 893.42, up 25.6 percent. The economy grew 7.5 percent and is expected to do even better this year.
With $55 billion in market capitalization, or about half that of Malaysia's market, and more than three times its turnover, Thailand may be a somewhat risky but potentially profitable option for overseas investors.
"Thailand is one of the better picks, and I expect it will hit new highs," said Timothy H. Moe, head of regional research at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd. "If politics are resolved in Hong Kong, then Hong Kong has the potential to go up higher than Thailand."
"But Thailand right now is not laboring under the same political cloud as Hong Kong," he added, "and it's a better bet than Malaysia, because the overall valuations are cheaper in Thailand."

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
High Hopes for Public Bonds

BYLINE: By Leslie Wayne

 BODY:
For the municipal bond market, Christmas came in November with the election of Bill Clinton as President. After 12 years of Republican efforts to shrink Government at all levels, states and cities, along with the Wall Street firms that underwrite their bonds, now feel that they've got a friend in the White House.
Wall Street, while trying to contain its optimism, expects politically fascinating and financially lucrative days ahead. What is unclear, however, is precisely what the Clinton Administration, however committed to greater public-works spending, will actually do. Equally unknown is what these new policies will mean for municipal issuers and underwriters. 
 Part of this good feeling stems from the fact that 1992 was a record year for municipal bonds, even with a Republican Administration. The volume of long-term municipal securities issued -- bonds to build prisons, bridges, roads and other bits of the infrastructure -- rose 36 percent, to a record $233 billion. Much of the volume came about because low interest rates enabled state and local governments to redeem old high-coupon bonds with lower-coupon, lower-cost, ones. A record $95 billion in municipal bonds were redeemed in 1992, twice 1991's level.
If interest rates stay low, refundings will continue in 1993, although at a slower pace, since most issuers that could refund have already done so. Instead, the action is shifting to Washington, where President-elect Clinton has promised to spend $20 billion a year in what he calls "hard Federal dollars" on infrastructure projects. And while details are fuzzy, Mr. Clinton has outlined a plan of matching Federal funds with municipal borrowings and private dollars.
Those in the municipal bond market are heartened by the perception that Mr. Clinton is one of them: a former bond issuer who has sat on numerous industry commissions. "He is someone who really understands this market and what it can do," said Michael McCarthy, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Co. "The question is whether this will translate into legislation that allows projects to happen that aren't already happening."
This is a far cry from the dark days for the industry that began with the far-reaching 1986 tax act. That measure made it harder for municipalities to issue many types of tax-exempt bonds and knocked some big buyers, mainly banks, out of the market. Since then, the cry for more public projects has increased as urban areas continue to decay and social, and environmental, problems rise. And at the same time, new funding for these projects has limped along.
So, at a time of pent-up demand for public-works financing comes a President ready to embrace it -- and raise taxes on the wealthy to increase the audience for tax-free bonds. But, many ask, how might this all happen? Former Representative Beryl Anthony of Arkansas, head of the influential Anthony Commission, has put forth a legislative package to roll back many of the 1986 changes -- including making it easier for banks to buy tax-free bonds, permitting more public-private ventures and lifting restrictions capping the amount of bonds municipalities can issue.
Mr. Anthony said he expects "broad support" for this package. And with plenty of reason: Mr. Clinton, as Arkansas Governor, was a founding member of the Anthony Commission and helped kick around some of these ideas. Besides, a similar package passed Congress last year only to be vetoed by President Bush. "As long as Bush was in the White House, no one wanted to work hard and get vetoed," said Mr. Anthony. "Now our work has a chance of getting enacted."
A more controversial proposal being floated by Mr. Anthony is the creation of a new type of tax-exempt bond, called a "public activity" bond. This bond would allow private investors to use tax-free bonds to build or buy a public-use business, like a wastewater treatment plant, and run it at a profit. This proposal raises the specter of past abuses where municipal bond proceeds were used solely for private ventures. But many years have passed since those abuses occurred, and public-private ventures are squarely in keeping with Mr. Clinton's stated philosophy.
Another notion being aired is the concept of federally guaranteed taxable infrastructure bonds, similar to Ginnie Mae bonds. These would be designed to lure some of the $3 trillion in pension dollars to infrastructure projects. Since pensions are not taxed, they rarely buy tax-free securities. But they would buy a federally-guaranteed taxable municipal bond -- if it existed. In Washington, however, some worry that this new guarantee will only create another contingent liability on the Federal budget. And they say there are already enough potential municipal bond investors out there, without having to turn to pensions. "I'm not sure it's understood how much our existing marketplace, with some minor changes, could be used without creating another government guarantee," said Micah S. Greene, executive vice president of the Public Securities Association. Lobbyists are scurrying around the transition team, and one another, to fine-tune this concept.
Oddly enough, however, some suggest that Mr. Clinton might just bypass the municipal bond market entirely and make direct Federal grants for projects. "Some people have seen past Democratic Administrations and think they can get the government to give them some money," said R. Fenn Putman, a managing director at Lehman Brothers. "And free money is better than low-cost money." Yet a close reading of Mr. Clinton's statements indicates that he will use Federal funds as seed money for state revolving funds, which then borrow in the marketplace. This "leveraging" creates more money for projects, even if some is borrowed.
Still, hardheaded Wall Street financiers are not ready to declare that happy days are here again. "Over the last 10 years, everything that could go wrong for the municipal market did," said Daniel Keating, head of municipal finance at Bear Stearns. "So if all this happens, it will work out well for us. But these days, no one is overly optimistic."

Did Wall Street Vigilantes Take a Snooze?

BYLINE: By Robert D. Hershey Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
They're known as Wall Street's vigilantes, the professional skeptics who buy and sell bonds for a living and who can reputedly see inflation threats visible to no one else. Their hypersensitive reactions to shifting Federal budget prospects are now studied by politicians as well as investors.
But the vigilantes, at least until the past few days, seem to have gone to sleep. How else do you explain a yield of less than 7 1/2 percent on 30-year Treasury bonds, a quarter percentage point less than when Bill Clinton was elected President, in the face of a hemorrhaging Federal budget? Perhaps the Street is reassured by the prominence in the new Administration of two of its own -- Robert E. Rubin of Goldman Sachs as chairman of the National Economic Council and Roger Altman of Blackstone Group as No. 2 at Treasury. 
 Perhaps Wall Street thinks global recession will keep interest rates in check. Oddly, recent statistics showing American growth picking up have tended to push interest rates down, not up, in the belief that Mr. Clinton will need a less ambitious stimulation package.
More likely, however, the vigilantes have forgotten -- or never learned -- budget history and still don't recognize the deficit's structural nature. Jimmy Carter with his "zero based" methodology projected a balanced budget, and he left office with record red ink. The same, writ large, for Ronald Reagan. And four years ago, the O.M.B. chief, Richard G. Darman, said: "We will succeed at deficit reduction," only to watch the deficit more than double, to $327.3 billion for the current year.
The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation failed to contain, much less reduce, the deficit. Nor has the ballyhooed but evadable Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The Government, which last posted a surplus in 1969, can no longer envision budgetary balance in distant years. And last week's annual projections by the Bush Administration brought a replay of political arguments about phony numbers, allowing the Clinton camp to start backing away from campaign pledges to halve the deficit over four years.
"There is a honeymoon going on," said one market operator when asked about the apparent suspension of critical faculties during the Clinton transition.
You don't have to buy the whole deficit-disaster scenario of Harry E. Figgie Jr.'s "Bankruptcy 1995" to lose sleep. Consider the fact that recent deficits do not yet reflect the exploding cost of health care and other entitlements, which accounted for the same 11 percent of national output in 1991 as they did in 1976.
Of course, Mr. Clinton and the Congressional Democrats, realizing that there's no longer anyone else to blame, may perform the fiscal equivalent of Richard Nixon's going to China and slash spening. But this doesn't seem the smart way to bet, particularly since Mr. Clinton's rhetoric is at odds with the evidence of him as a guy who finds it hard to say no.

Stock Twists and Turns of '92

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Playing the stock market so far in the 90's has been like taking a ride on Coney Island's famous Cyclone roller-coaster. Stock funds in 1990 suffered a 7.3 percent loss on average, only to attain a return of 30.7 percent in '91 and then skid last year to a gain of just 6 percent.
But even that small return didn't come until the end of the year. The stock market was flat most of 1992, nervously waiting to learn who would next occupy the White House, and only bounded up in November and December on post-election euphoria. 
 In another abrupt turn, the market finally began favoring undervalued stocks over growth companies and funds that invest in smaller companies bested their blue-chip cousins for the second year in a row.
Funds that invest in shares of small companies, by far the riskiest group of major stock funds, led that pack with a 12.5 percent return, according to Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J. Next in line were equity-income funds, with a 9.4 percent return, and growth-and-income funds, 8.6 percent, both of which own high-dividend stocks or bonds that lift their returns.
Among specialty funds, the 14 financial services funds, which invest in banks, brokerages, insurance companies and the like, continued their strong run, landing first place in that category with a remarkable 35.3 percent return. Other winners were science and technology, 13.5 percent, and real estate, 12.8 percent. Stodgy utilities funds also shone, at 9.1 percent.
Starring among hybrid funds were the convertible securities funds, boasting a 13.6 percent return. Other funds that own a mix of stocks and bonds performed about the same as all-stock ones. Balanced funds showed a return of 7.2 percent and asset-allocation funds had a 7.5 percent return.
Despite the European currency crisis last fall and other instability abroad, funds that invest in gold, which is fast losing its reputation as a refuge from international turmoil, showed a 14.6 percent loss. Other losers were the health-and-biotechnology funds -- 1991's biggest gainers -- with an 8.3 percent loss, and environmental funds, a 6.2 percent loss.
For the fourth consecutive year, America was the best place to invest, with major stock funds returning 8.9 percent. The international funds as a group lost 5.1 percent. Because of a stock market scandal and continuing political and economic problems in Japan, funds that invest there were the year's biggest losers, plunging 21.3 percent. European issues did not fare too well either, losing 8 percent. Funds in Latin America and the Pacific region were basically flat.
This middle-of-the-road year for the investor looks much rosier from the perspective of the fund industry. Record-low yields in taxable money markets -- the funds yielded 3.39 percent on average for the year, according to IBC/Donoghue in Ashland, Mass. -- pushed investors into higher-risk alternatives.
As a result, the industry will wind up with twelve-month net sales of roughly $185 billion, up $40 billion from the previous record set in 1986 and $66.5 billion higher than in 1991, said Dean P. Eberling, an asset management and brokerage analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers.
The explosive growth probably will continue if significant household money now in money market funds, certificates of deposit and bank accounts continues to flow into stock and bond funds. Any type of pro-savings legislation coming from the new Democratic administration "would be an additional positive," Mr. Eberling said.
Just as hordes of first-time investors moved into mutual funds, one large recipient of their money, the short-term multi-market funds, collapsed. These funds, intended to capture high yields on government securities abroad, fell victim to the European currency crisis. When funds move into such sophisticated trading strategies or derivative securities, the results have been mainly disastrous and last year was no exception.
As the fixed-income market gets more and more esoteric, "I worry that we will have more problems," said Don Phillips, vice president of Morningstar Inc., a mutual fund research group in Chicago.
Trouble ahead could come in the form of a spike in interest rates. Most investors and fund managers haven't seen interest rates rise in years. While investors may be aware of default risk, many do not understand that prices of long-term securities, like most municipal bonds, would fall if rates rose.
One portent of trouble may be that 1992 was the year of the deal in the fund industry. Recalling that the sales of Smith Barney and Kidder Peabody came just before the 1987 stock market crash, some have suggested that such transactions are a warning of market peaks.
This year, two of the biggest players in municipal bond funds changed hands: John Nuveen & Company sold shares to the public and Van Kampen Merritt, a Xerox division, was sold to its management.
The biggest deal of all was the acquisition of John Templeton's international mutual fund empire by Franklin Resources Inc. for $913 million.
Franklin has a strong domestic fixed-income business, and its new bet on international equities, especially those culled using a value approach, may be as shrewd, some analysts say, as its original bet on bonds in the early 80's.

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
Where Giants Tread: A New Biography of Microsoft's Chief

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
William H. Gates is one of the busiest executives in the world, people who work for him say, yet he still finds time to read books. If he can do it, so can anyone. An appropriate one to start with is "Gates: How Microsoft's Mogul Reinvented an Industry and Made Himself the Richest Man in America," by Stephen Manes and Paul Andrews ($25, Doubleday).
It is not the first biography of Mr. Gates, co-founder and chairman of the Microsoft Corporation and, as everyone seems compelled to add, the richest man in America. Given that Mr. Gates is but 37 years old, there will surely be many other attempts. But this book, written by a veteran computer industry columnist and a reporter for The Seattle Times, is to date the definitive work. 
 The most complete and thoroughly documented history of the Microsoft Corporation and its role in the emergence of the personal computer industry, the book provides many surprises. Contrary to what one would expect from a company that so thoroughly dominates the software industry, Microsoft's success arises from a steady procession of failures and missteps. The key is that each spurred Mr. Gates all the more to succeed.
"Gates," the book, gets beyond the cliche of Gates the billionaire nerd. It reveals, instead, a very smart guy with a passion not just to succeed but to win . . . no, to dominate. In his early 20's, he rebuffed a lucrative buyout offer from H. Ross Perot. He works 72 hours a week with occasional bursts of up to 90, and even when he is not working he devours information the way a black hole sucks up light.
But there are lots of very smart and competitive men and women at the helms of businesses, and "Gates" is particularly good at providing insights into what sets Mr. Gates apart. To use a computer analogy, the book tries to peer at his source code, at the basic instructions that define his essence. The field of biotechnology is his second passion, and logic and rationale replace spirituality and faith in Mr. Gates's cosmology.
His management style is heavier on the stick than on the carrot, but the carrot is golden. A single $1 share of Microsoft stock held since 1981, before the company went public, is worth approximately $1,500 today. At one point, new programmers were given 2,500 shares with a promise that they would someday be a "downpayment on a house." Mr. Gates's worth is estimated at more than $7 billion; literally hundreds of his employees have stock holdings worth more than $1 million, and Mr. Gates's chief lieutenant, Steve Ballmer, is a billionaire. So is Paul Allen, a high school pal of Mr. Gates and a co-founder of Microsoft who now owns the Seattle Supersonics basketball team.
Mr. Gates appears to shrug off the current Federal Trade Commission investigation into whether Microsoft's business practices are monopolistic and impassive when the stock market buffets his Microsoft holdings ("I have an infinite amount of money"). But he is truly outraged when he reads that a competitor, Philippe Kahn of Borland International Inc., referred to him as "not a technical guy."
When Mr. Gates prefaces a response to reporter's question by saying "I don't know how technical you are," he might as well be questioning the writer's character. Although he has not personally coded any Microsoft software in years, he still appears to take greater pride in his technical savvy than in his substantial business skills.
The nontechnical side of Mr. Gates is illuminated to some degree -- not enough, but far more than in previous accounts of Mr. Gates's life: his well-to-do family in Seattle, with whom he remains very close; his occasional escapades, from marathon poker games to undergraduate pranks at Harvard, before he dropped out; his collections of exotic cars and speeding tickets.
Whether this approach reflects Mr. Gates's obsession with business or the writers' inability to tap into the other parts of his personality is unclear. Mr. Gates did consent to be interviewed and opened the Microsoft archives to the writers, but most detail from those interviews appears to focus on business matters.
Mr. Manes said in a telephone interview that after Mr. Gates obtained a bootlegged copy of the book's galley proofs, the Microsoft chief spent seven hours on the phone from Hawaii, where he was vacationing, arguing with the writers "in excruciating detail" about various points.
Mr. Gates's main concern, Mr. Manes said, appeared to be that he felt he did not get enough credit for his achievements as a programmer and that Microsoft did not get enough credit for outsmarting its rivals, as opposed to simply being lucky or aggressive or persistent.
In the end, readers may still not feel that they know Mr. Gates, but they certainly will understand him better. And because Mr. Gates is, for all practical purposes, the embodiment of the personal computer industry, readers will also have a better understanding of the issues that affect the industry.
 
'The Virtual Corporation'
 Another thoughtful book for the new year is "The Virtual Corporation: Structuring and Revitalizing the Corporation for the 21st Century," by William H. Davidow and Michael S. Malone ($23, Harper Collins).
Virtual is a buzzword in the industry today -- with virtual machines, virtual memory and virtual reality. It means, essentially, something that acts as if it is something else. A virtual corporation, then, is a business organization that can be many things to many people, quite apart from the rigid, hierarchical corporations of today. In this vision, the corporation's structure is determined by its customers, rather than its executives.
Using examples taken from successful businesses, the authors attempt to outline the requisites for business success in the coming century, when they expect "virtual companies" to compete on a global scale to deliver "virtual products" -- mainly information -- instantly to customers.
The authors are occasionally given to breathless forecasting: "By the year 2015, the United States will either be a leader in this new business revolution or it will be a postindustrial version of a developing country. Either a nation of independent knowledge workers or a colony of economic serfs." If such binary thinking is a bit hard to take, the book does present a compelling vision of how businesses are evolving. The challenges are already clear: education of the workforce as learning becomes more important than manual labor; increased global competition, and the changing role of management in an information-based company.

HEADLINE: Father Earth

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: TAOS, N.M.

 BODY:
About 15 miles west of Taos, a road with no name tapers off into the flat tableland beneath the Tres Orejas, three small volcanic peaks. Soon the road disappears entirely. All that remains is a thick carpet of snow and a set of coyote tracks pitching toward infinity.
But if you can envision an Alternative Republic here, you don't need a road. Thus, a frigid winter morning recently found Michael Reynolds, a one-man Monkey Wrench gang of architecture, barreling through the snowdrifts, his Dodge pickup swerving every which way, destined for an unsightly pile of tires and dirt, his new Atlantis: downtown Star. 
 And so, as the New Year begins, changing the world has come down to this: a Taos morning blue with cold, a 47-year-old man with fly-away hair and a pickax pounding frozen dirt into used tires -- the detritus of 20th-century civilization and building blocks of a new utopia.
Star is an acronym for the Social Transformation Alternative Republic, a 1,100-acre self-sufficient community for around 300 people that Mr. Reynolds, a renegade pioneer in the alternative-housing movement, is building on a sage- and pinon-flecked periphery of town.
The houses at Star will be what Mr. Reynolds has christened "earth ships," dwellings made of rammed earth and tires that the architect has been perfecting in and around Taos for the last 20 years. His goal -- already realized at another project nearby -- is to be independent of the conventional power grid. Instead of being heated by electricity, the earth ships will use sculpted earth, tire walls and the sun, which also powers the photovoltaic cells that provide electricity. Rather than conventional plumbing, there will be catch-water roof systems to harvest and filter runoff from snow and rain. Used water from bathtubs and sinks will be piped into jungly planters where flowers and vegetables grow. There will be no sewers -- only solar toilets, an invention of Mr. Reynolds that reduces human waste to dust, dust that "may even be good for something," he said.
Mr. Reynolds called Star a republic, rather than a housing development, and half jokingly threatened secession from the United States if Government authorities try to intervene. He talks fast and thinks globally. His main objective at Star, according to the community's articles of association, will be to "evolve humanity into an earthen harmony." The earthen harmony, he said, will be "half dictatorship, half democracy."
Mr. Reynolds doesn't think of himself as a guru, though ardent disciples read his books and watch his videos. He doesn't particularly look like one, either, padding around his offices in kneepads and wool socks with toes poking through, or being engaged in his seemingly futile midwinter tire-pounding rituals, proof "you can build these things even in the dead of winter with bozos," as he called his crew. He sees himself as a scout, a "scout on a wagon train going west."
Alternative building styles, from his steel-belted radicalism to houses constructed of straw bales, have experienced something of a resurgence recently in New Mexico, a home of adobe construction. Though the material has a poverty stigma in the third world, where it is a staple, in places like Santa Fe, it is as much an accouterment of the good life as are Range Rovers and Jacuzzis.
A movement within the growing green architecture movement, which focuses on energy efficiency and nontoxic building materials, the current bubble of alternative activity is "a somewhat logical extension of the 60's," said Stuart Brand, the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog. It combines a concern for home and family with affordable housing and environmentalism. Mr. Reynolds's grand experiment is anti-industrial in the way it uses technology to bypass utilities and other outside life-support systems but is more sophisticated and replicable than early back-to-the-land efforts.
Viewed collectively, Mr. Brand said, mini-movements like Mr. Reynolds's suggest that "hippie premises haven't been entirely undone, and people now have the time and money to act on them." Mr. Reynolds believes that earth ships contrast with the now-fabled communes, which betrayed a "naive trust in human nature." "The thing is," he said, "people don't want to live together. These people also froze to death. They didn't have the right vessel."
The right vessel -- the low-budget model -- is a two-bedroom, 1,000-square-foot house with horseshoe-shaped rooms tucked into the earth. Its walls are made from stacked tire casings, indestructible building blocks packed solidly with dirt. The rammed dirt functions like a battery, storing and releasing the earth's own warmth as well as heat from the sun. It takes about 800 or 900 automobile tires (and a matrix of innumerable aluminum cans and cement) to build one house. A basic earth ship can cost anywhere from $30,000 to $40,000 if the owner is his own contractor and does much of the work himself. And it can cost as little as $60,000 for a custom-designed original by his company, Solar Survival Architecture.
On a treacherously steep mountainside outside of town, Mr. Reynolds's latest ideas have already taken root at Reach (or Rural Earthship Alternative Community Habitat), a cluster of 15 earth ships, two of which have been completed, slinking up the cliffside like a new-age Mesa Verde.
Among the Reach homeowners are the actor Dennis Weaver and his wife, Gerry, who have also built a $1 million, 10,000-square-foot earth ship in Ridgway, Colo., a mammoth pad that Mr. Reynolds wryly referred to as the Earth Yacht. Keith Carradine is another client. Mr. Weaver called Mr. Reynolds "an absolute dedicated risk-taking visionary genius." The actor is promulgating the earth-ship concept through lectures and his own mail-order video. (Mr. Weaver's come-on on the package has a more show-biz feeling: "As seen on 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.' Mr. Reynolds's pitch in promotional literature -- "Good for getting permits" -- is more basic.)
For Mr. Reynolds, earth ships are a social mission that transcends architecture. "A lunar module allows you to go to the moon and function," he is fond of saying, vaguely echoing Buckminster Fuller, whose geodesic domes were considered radical concepts for spaceship earth. "This vessel enables you to live on the earth and function."
Mr. Reynolds's inspiration is not Buckminster Fuller. It is Noah. "Noah was building an ark to survive the coming storm," he said, pounding tires one afternoon on the mesa, the red dirt flinging from his pickax and adhering to the sweat on his nose. "We're building vessels for the storm we're already in."
Underlying the world's problems is stress, or so Mr. Reynolds thinks -- the terrible stress that comes from having to "work at a job seven days a week" to pay the mortgage. Give people a cheap, energy-efficient house that they can build themselves, and you liberate them from the "rip-off" of mortgages and bank loans. They are then free to pursue whatever makes them happy. It's the fluffy bunny-rabbit theory: "Put it into a corner, and it'll claw you," he said. "But take the stress out of its life, put it in a house with solar heat and banana leaves, and it will blossom. It's no fun to be around cornered rabbits who are uptight and weirded out."
So far, Mr. Reynolds has signed up 29 weirded-out rabbit couples for Star, where construction will begin in earnest in late March, and he expects nearly 200 more. Earth-ship owners have the option of buying a generic set of drawings for $1,200 from Mr. Reynolds and building the house with a knowledgeable crew, or hiring Solar Survival Architecture to do the work (at a minimum of $65 a square foot), as Mr. Weaver did. Or they can combine the two. Solar Survival offers weekend how-to seminars seven times a year, costing $600 a couple or $350 a person. Mr. Reynolds has published the two-volume "Earthship: How to Build Your Own," which has sold 20,000 copies and become something of a cult classic. Thanks in part to Mr. Weaver's video, word has spread. Pat Habicht, a soft-spoken Englishwoman who lives in an early-model earth ship, charges $15 for earth-ship tours to the curious pilgrims seeking enlightment on earth ships.
One recent morning, two 40-ish women from San Francisco -- one a massage therapist, the other a nutritionist -- met with Mr. Reynolds at his headquarters, in a place he calls the Castle, a bizarre-looking sparkly structure of cement and beer cans that tends to exude an unearthly glow. They were talking about what he called their tool scene and finalizing the generic earth ship that they plan to build with a crew at Star this spring for $50 a square foot. Their home will include fish and waterlilies. "It's like being a pioneer," one of them said. "You're taking responsibility for your own beingness."
MR. REYNOLDS forsees a time when people might be liberated by their earth ships, in which he said most food "except bacon and Cheetos." could be grown. He also predicts the money economy will be replaced by a barter economy as the drudgery of earning a living slips away. Eventually, the dams, landfills, nuclear power plants and other scourges of humankind could disappear.
"The ramifications are pretty intense," Mr. Reynolds said. "I turned a rock over in my imagination and saw a pearl."
Mr. Reynolds, who grew up in and around Louisville, Ky., moved to northern New Mexico in the 1960's after studying architecture at the University of Cincinnati with the goal of "racing motorcycles, getting hurt and avoiding the draft." His mother was a homemaker. His father, a milkman, used to hoard materials like oatmeal cartons. "That planted the seed," he recalled. "I learned that this was not waste. It was material."
He got a teaching job at a vocational school outside Taos, resulting in a draft deferment. After watching news reports of housing and garbage crises, he started tinkering with beer cans. In 1971, he built his first beer-can house in Taos. "It was in The Denver Post right under Nixon's picture, in color," he recalled nostalgically.
He began experimenting with bunkerlike rammed-earth dwellings, and wilder structures topped with wind turbines that had an esthetic not unlike that of a cement mixer. But it wasn't until he discovered pyramids that he had an epiphany -- a drugless one, he hastens to point out.
As he wrote in his book "A Coming of Wizards: A Manual of Human Potential" (High Mesa Press, 1988), sleeping in a pyramid connected him with the energy patterns of the universe. The room started tilting and spinning, and there were swirling purples and a red misty haze. The wizards spoke. "Whether it was my mind or the cosmos talking, I don't know," he says today. He was one weirded-out rabbit.
Abandoning pyramids because 75 percent of the people wouldn't understand them, he pursued the less telepathic earth ship. He was determined to find a housing solution that, "like a radio frequency," could hook people up with their "energy band."
His penchant for test-piloting his own houses has taken a toll. "The typical wife," he said, doesn't want to move every three years to another "psychic proving ground." He's had five weddings (three to the same person); his wife, Chris Simpson, is an astrologer. His energy band includes a sense of humor. "At least they always get a house out of it," he said of his exes.
Despite his cosmic observances, the two completed earth ships at Reach -- custom-built by his company -- are down-to-earth and quite lovely. The houses, one of them Mr. Weaver's, have thick curved walls, echoing the bend in the tires, and exposed rugged cliff faces that contrast with the smooth earthen/ stucco finishes. Rooms are designed in U-shapes, instead of at right angles, and they open onto a bright hallway lined with solar windows that face south. The slanting glass is angled to fully capture the winter sun's reflection. An interior wetlands runs the full length of the house, a lush welter of tomato plants, peas, flowers and herbs.
It's too soon to tell how the Reach houses -- the first ones to go cold turkey off the conventional power grid -- will work day in and day out (one wonders how a compost toilet and photovoltaic-powered washer-dryer work during extended family gatherings). But many of the ideas are rooted in common sense, and that is why New Mexico building officials seem willing to work with him.
Although Reach and Star are located outside the Taos city limits, they are still subject to New Mexico state building codes, which have responded to statewide interest in alternative building by granting experimental permits to people like Mr. Reynolds. Homeowner must also sign waivers saying they are aware of their houses' experimental nature and absolving the state of liability.
Of the fledgling earth ships built by Solar Survival in and around Taos, some of them 18 years old, none have suffered building failure, said Bob Koss, the state's regional building inspector. But questions remain about what will happen when novices with tires in their eyes build earth ships on a large scale. At Star, Mr. Koss noted, Mr. Reynolds "is getting close to the point where he's not going to have the control that he did." Mr. Reynolds will inspect the earth ships, for a sliding fee, four times during the construction process.
ONE of Mr. Reynolds's major premises is that earth ships can be built by anybody, anywhere. Although Noah survived 40 days and 40 nights of rain, some people doubt that earth ships would. The Austin, Tex., architect Pliny Fisk 3d, an expert on alternative building technologies, worries that "people are getting mesmerized." In damper climates, he said, there is a concern that walls one day may collapse. Others wonder about invading pristine places with "vacation houses for environmental dilettantes," as one Taos resident put it.
Though Mr. Reynolds said his do-it-yourself earth-ship formula is "hard to mess up," the idea that any committed person can build one is certainly debatable. Marsha Campbell, a 49-year-old social worker, moved to Taos from Ohio to build an earth ship in 1991. Her tales are reminiscent of Great Plains pioneer women in sod houses -- living in an unfinished dirt house, hauling 40-pound containers of water, dashing to the outhouse in the dead of night. Eventually she reached the end of her $20,000, unable to complete the project. Along the way, she and her lover broke up.
"I think Michael Reynolds is a genius," she now says, "and the idea works if you can hire him to build the house. But if you can't, you suffer. In my life, I've been pretty much able to do everything I set out to do. But I certainly couldn't build that stupid house."
Mr. Reynolds's personal supervision costs money -- $65 an hour, to be exact. He acknowledges that the popularity of the books and videos may have lead to some false expectations. "They somehow get the impression that I'm on call anytime to take them to nirvana," he said. There is a potential scenario at Star not unlike one involving 200 fifth graders who all need Daddy to help them with their homework.
Still, out on the Taos mesas, where the soul feels limitless and it seems possible to see forever, some have clearly found, if not exactly nirvana, a reasonable facsimile. There is something elemental about living in a house that requires its occupants to watch the weather, as if they were hawks or beavers, sensing what the wind and clouds will do instead of setting a thermostat.
"You have to be partners with the house," said Mr. Weaver, who has become the Bob Vila of earth ships. If it's cloudy three days in a row, you can't use the washing machine. Speaking by telephone, Mr. Weaver sounded genuinely happy. Indoors, there were bananas. Outside, it was blizzarding.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Congress And Clinton: A Handshake If Not a Kiss

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ALL over the Capitol, moonstruck Democrats are pledging allegiance to Bill Clinton and the legislation for which he stands. Whatever that is.
For example, Senate aides say campaign finance legislation, a subject of more than casual interest to the lawmakers, simply awaits Mr. Clinton's improvements. Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, told a subcommittee chairman last week that the committee would do what Mr. Clinton wanted on health care. The new chairman of the House Budget Committee, Representative Martin O. Sabo, said the committee would delay work on deficit reduction legislation until it hears from him. 
 The amiable mood has even been taken up by Senate Republicans, who are playing patty-cake with Mr. Clinton's Cabinet selections. But that seems more like a tactical approach -- lying low until a target is spotted.
But what is the basis of this lovesick behavior by the Democrats? And how long can it last?
 
Too Few Accomplishments
 First of all, it is not a longstanding romance. Mr. Clinton became the choice of Congressional Democrats, whom he occasionally slighted, only after they concluded he had a good chance to be President. While they admire him, at root this is a marriage of political convenience.
There are two main reasons this marriage seems advantageous to the Congressional Democrats. The first is that they think the country looks down on Congress because it couldn't accomplish much fighting with President Bush, and that their fate is therefore linked to Mr. Clinton's. Only if he succeeds can they succeed. Second, many important lawmakers want to make laws, not just be here.
Speaker Thomas S. Foley is not striking a political pose when he says, "There is a tremendous desire here to work with the new Administration and to produce a legislative result and to move forward on the deficit, economic growth and health care reform." It's not just those big issues, either. Committee chairmen are already at work translating some of his campaign promises into bills they hope he will support, in areas from job apprenticeship to childhood immunizations.
They already have his support on some bills Mr. Bush vetoed last year, especially family leave and voter registration, so they can pass them soon.
But this relationship faces problems when it starts confronting money. The Government doesn't have nearly enough to do all that Mr. Clinton or the Congressional Democrats would like to do, and someone has to be denied. As Prof. Charles Jones of the University of Wisconsin put it, in some ways the issues "don't change very much from what Bush and the Congress were facing last year. And those issues go to the core of how are you going to do more with less. How are you going to solve these problems within the constraint of the great Reagan debt?"
That issue has to be faced first sometime in March, when the national debt bumps up against its statutory ceiling and the House confronts the need to cast painful if meaningless votes to raise the ceiling. And if that issue is combined with deficit reduction measures, as House leaders expect, some interests in the party are going to feel shortchanged.
The test for Mr. Clinton and Congressional leaders is to frame those questions in ways that give members "political cover for disappointing their constituents," as Representative Vic Fazio put it.
Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, who is more inclined than many Washingtonians to expect the good mood to last, said: "To help Clinton, they will have to incur the wrath of someone. The challenge to Clinton is to frame the choices and the issues in a way that gets members to recalculate -- to think through anew those costs and benefits."
Or, as Mr. Fazio said, to explain that you were voting for something that wasn't perfect in order to support the President "for the good of the country." He added: "A lot of people are inclined to do that for Clinton."
It is not clear just what the Republicans can do to affect this process. In the Senate, they can filibuster. They say they want to see what Mr. Clinton will actually propose. "The game hasn't begun yet," said Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader. "We're in the warm-up period. Everyone's shooting free throws."
 
Mindless Obstructionism
 In the House, Republicans expect to obstruct and delay. Their quarrel is not so much with Mr. Clinton as with House Democrats. Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, their second-ranking leader, said this week that Republicans would routinely force every roll call they can as a way to show displeasure at Democratic bullying on rules. But to the country it might just look like mindless obstructionism, and there is nothing like Mr. Gingrich and such tactics to unify the Democrats.
In the long run, Mr. Foley observed, "it's unrealistic to assume that there will never be disagreement and all will be perfect consensus." So Mr. Clinton's reaction will matter when Congress amends a proposal and passes it. Will he be like Lyndon B. Johnson, who used to claim victory if he got more or less what he asked, or like Jimmy Carter, who used to grumble when he didn't get absolutely everything?
The future of this relationship depends most of all on Mr. Clinton, and how he handles his Presidency generally. "Presidents who are perceived to be powerful and popular get their way," Mr. Fazio said.

HEADLINE: SO MUCH FOR THEORY;
Clinton's Bright Ideas Get to Meet the Ugly Facts

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN campaigning for President, Abraham Lincoln promised not to abolish slavery. Franklin D. Roosevelt vowed to balance the budget. Lyndon B. Johnson said he was not "about to send American boys 9,000 or 10,000 miles away from home to do what Asian boys ought to be doing for themselves." Richard M. Nixon had a secret plan to end the war in Vietnam. Jimmy Carter said he would remove price controls on natural gas. Ronald Reagan said he would never negotiate for the release of hostages. And, of course, George Bush promised not to raise taxes.
So when Bill Clinton seemed to back off last week from his campaign pledge to cut the Federal budget deficit in half over the next four years, hardly anyone was surprised. As Mr. Bush said in 1990 when he announced he had changed his mind about taxes, "That's the American system." 
 It is not so much that candidates mean to lie. Most of the time, they honestly think they can keep their campaign promises. But the problems of government turn out to be more intractable as one gets closer to being responsible for solving them.
Presidential candidates can make the world stand still. They are free to develop promises and proposals at the outset and stick with them through Election Day. For a President, the world spins round and round, and what seemed like wise policy yesterday is often overtaken by events by tomorrow.
Peter B. Teeley, the United States Ambassador to Canada, who is a friend and political adviser of Mr. Bush's, put the matter this way: "You get into office and you get very hard information for the first time. It can be economic figures or it can be intelligence on foreign policy or defense problems, and it becomes a very cold shower that wakes you up from the campaign."
That is what has happened to Mr. Clinton. Last January, the Bush Administration's Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office, the Government's two main economic forecasters, both reported that a strong economy and the completion of the savings and loan bailout would allow the deficit in 1996 to be about half what it was in 1992, even if no tax and spending policies were changed. So Mr. Clinton's promise was somewhat empty. All it meant was that if somewhere he cut taxes or increased spending, elsewhere he would have to raise taxes or reduce spending.
By July, circumstances had changed. The economy was growing more slowly than expected. Medical costs were rising faster. Some expenditures for the savings and loan bailout had been put off for another fiscal year. Budget officials reported in their midyear review that the 1992 deficit would be slightly lower than had been forecast in January but that in 1996 it would be quite a bit higher.
But while his advisers cautioned him during the summer that his promise to cut the deficit in half over four years would be much harder to keep, Mr. Clinton, at least publicly, paid them no heed. "A candidate can't afford to keep changing positions," said an aide who regularly traveled on the campaign plane. "He would have been accused of flip-flopping, and no candidate can stand that in the middle of a campaign."
Last week, Mr. Bush's budget office released its official economic forecasts, and they painted a picture that was worse than ever. The deficit in fiscal year 1992, which ended in September, was $290 billion, and without any changes in policy, the Administration reported, the deficit will be $266 billion in 1996 and $305 billion in 1997.
In Little Rock, Mr. Clinton called the new figures an "unsettling revelation." His assistants accused the Bush Administration of cooking the books in a way that actually understated the probable deficit for 1996 and 1997 by as much as $60 billion each year, an assertion that Richard G. Darman, Mr. Bush's budget director, denied.
 
Off Balance
 Mr. Clinton's surprise was surely exaggerated, and Mr. Darman's figures were probably unrealistic. But they agreed on one basic point: Mr. Clinton cannot cut the deficit in half and still fulfill his promises to increase spending for public works, education and job training, to allow college students to work off loans by joining a national service corps, to overhaul the welfare system, to cut taxes for middle-income families and businesses that invest in new equipment and to raise taxes on no one but families with annual incomes above $200,000.
"The math does not work," said Mr. Darman.
In a way, Mr. Clinton seemed to relish the news. It gave him a trap door to escape some campaign promises, and it helped prepare political ground for unpopular tax and spending measures.
There was other bad news last week as well. The Commerce Department reported that spending on health care rose to 14 percent of the nation's total economic output in 1992, the highest ever, and that medical spending would continue to go up 12 percent to 15 percent a year "unless significant changes in the health-care system occur."
The chief Federal auditor, Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, a Reagan appointee, warned the new Administration that the Government's books had been seriously mismanaged in recent years and that it had tens of billions of dollars of hidden liabilities for such matters as cleaning up toxic waste and paying off depositors of failed banks and savings and loan associations.
Overseas, tensions worsened in Iraq and Somalia. The war and human tragedy in Bosnia continued with the Clinton team seemingly undecided about what course to follow. Mr. Clinton and his advisers have worried aloud since the election that international problems, basically ignored during the campaign, might be so demanding that Mr. Clinton would not be able to pay full attention to economic issues at home.
 
Tax and Charge
 So far, the economy is still topic A. No one divulged exactly what was discussed at Mr. Clinton's meeting Thursday with his economic advisers. But a good bet is that they talked about how the only way to limit the deficit is to increase the taxes of middle-income Americans, cut popular programs or both, and how the only way to get a handle on medical costs is to change the system under which most people get whatever treatment they want wherever they want, at little or no out-of-pocket cost.
Mr. Clinton clearly understands this. During his two-day economic conference in Little Rock last month, he displayed a dazzling grasp of economic and social policy issues. But not once during the campaign and not since has Mr. Clinton let on that ordinary Americans might have to sacrifice anything they now enjoy.
In other words, he has still not addressed the fundamental questions he ducked during the campaign but will have to face squarely as President: Who will have to give up what, and when will he tell them so?

Coming Soon: Fingerprints at Many Fingertips

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
SAY the word "fingerprint" and scenes out of Dragnet begin to flicker: A burly cop rolling a suspect's fingers in messy black ink. Detectives with magnifying glasses poring over smudged file cards.
But think again. 
 A fingerprint, thanks to recent technological advances, can now be captured in a flash by an optical scanner tethered to a personal computer. No ink involved. And that new ease in taking prints -- which some say removes the air of being arrested -- means that the demand for fingerprints may rise the same way that demand for Social Security numbers has risen over the last 50 years. This cheers some police departments and worries some civil libertarians.
Someday, fingerprints may be imbedded -- as a numerical code, not as an actual print -- in credit cards so a cashier with a finger scanner can tell whether the person presenting the card is the person who owns it. Eventually, a fingerprint registered at the front desk may replace hotel room keys, and a touch on a mini-scanner will open the door to the room.
"It's the only true form of identification," said Archie Yew, marketing manager of Cogent Systems of Alhambra, Calif., which writes software for fingerprint systems. "And you carry it with you wherever you go."
The new fingerprint technology has been slowly developed over the last 20 years for its obvious first customer, law enforcement agencies.
Already, more than half the states and several major cities have set up their own data bases that, sometimes within hours, can electronically identify fingerprints lifted at a crime scene. Once, a detective's only options were to send in a list of suspects with the prints, or request a print-by-print search that might take weeks or months by hand.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has converted the prints of about 24 million criminals into mathematical formulas. It has the prints of another 4 million criminals, plus the prints of 38 million other Americans, most of them military veterans or Federal employees, on file cards.
Right now, despite what television has led people to think, the police rarely dust for fingerprints except in murders and other serious crimes. It is expensive and time-consuming to collect prints at the scene -- and then fingerprint other people to sort out the ones that belong to the victim or anyone else there legitimately. But if having fingerprints might instantly produce a list of suspects from old arrest records, the police might begin dusting for prints more often.
Some spectacular breakthroughs have already been made. In October, a 37-year-old ex-burglar was convicted of murdering a widow in the Bronx in 1974. Fingerprints had been found on a brandy glass and a window, but had lain in police files for 17 years until a detective decided to try cross-checking them in the new data bases of the F.B.I. and several states. They matched those of Herman Myers, a former Bronx resident who was living in South Carolina and had been arrested on an incest charge there.
Other law-enforcement uses are in the offing. In about two years, the F.B.I. says, fingerprint scanners tied to a national computer network will be in some police cruisers, letting officers know, for example, whether a speeder is a wanted fugitive.
The new technology is already being used by other agencies to prevent things like welfare fraud.
Social services officials in California's Los Angeles County and in two upstate New York State counties are fingerprinting welfare applicants to prevent them from collecting duplicate benefits by registering at several offices under different names. In the California program's first 16 months, officials said, it saved $7.8 million because 314 applicants were caught filing duplicate applications and another 3,010 were dropped from the rolls after refusing to be fingerprinted.
The new technology converts the unique pattern of a fingerprint's ridges, bifurcations and endings, called minutiae, into a mathematical formula. A computer data base can quickly compare a print's formula with others.
With better software and the recent development of "live" scanners -- which read the print directly from the finger, rather than from a card -- the technology can be installed almost anywhere.
 
ExpensiveAt a Cost
 But it's expensive. A minimal system, like that used by one county, costs over $2 million. A large one like that used by California's Department of Justice costs over $30 million.
A single scanner can cost $1,000, said Oscar Pieper, president of Identicator Corp. in California. But hardware should get cheaper. "As time goes on, it will become less expensive, like calculators and microwaves and VCR's," said Julie Watts, marketing director for National Registry, a St. Petersburg, Fla., company that markets the devices.
Lawrence Sherman, professor of criminology at the University of Maryland, said he is skeptical that there will be any revolution in police work. Even cities that can afford scanners in cruisers may worry about their adverse effects.
It may be "better policing not to be so intrusive on the street," Professor Sherman said. "In a racially tense or economically tense area, if the police are stopping people a lot and checking ID's, it can precipitate disturbances or maybe even riots."
 
Cross-Referencing
 Civil libertarians fear that the confidentiality of fingerprint data gathered to fight crime will quickly be breached. What, some ask, would stop immigration authorities from retrieving the fingerprints of welfare recipients, or even of credit-card holders, to ferret out illegal aliens?
"Because the largest fingerprint file is maintained by law enforcement," said Janlori Goldman, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's privacy and technology project, "my concern is the sort of cross-referencing of fingerprints between the F.B.I., the Department of Motor Vehicles, the immigration office and the welfare office."
To guard against such pooling of data, the New York state legislature, for one, has barred state welfare officials from sharing the prints of welfare applicants with the criminal justice system. And private manufacturers assure that their data bases will be impenetrable by the government.
Even with scanners that make getting fingerprinted more like photocopying one's hand than like Dragnet, many people still associate the process with crime. That bothers many advocates for the poor, who say it may frighten away the people who need help most.
It "really is a criminalization of poverty," said Rachel Leon, an advocate for the poor in Albany. "To people who do not understand, there may be a real fear that in the future it will be used against them."
Lisa Nunez, an official in Los Angeles County's Department of Social Services, disagreed.
"The system is very user-friendly," she said. "Having your picture taken has to be a lot more intimidating than having your print scanned."

HEADLINE: U.S. SAYS BAGHDAD REMOVED MISSILES

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
The White House said today that it was satisfied that Baghdad had "backed down" in the face of an allied ultimatum by removing surface-to-air missiles that were threatening allied planes patrolling the skies of southern Iraq.
American officials said it did not appear that Iraq had fully met the allies' original demands that the missiles, which set off a new confrontation over Iraqi military movements, be returned to their "original sites or configurations" within 48 hours. 
 But the officials said that the Iraqis had removed the immediate threat to allied air patrols by dismantling and dispersing the missile batteries, and that some of them seemed to be headed to their original locations.
 
Preliminary View Confirmed
 There were indications Friday night that the White House believed Baghdad had responded in a way that would make military action unnecessary. But it was not until today, when additional reconnaissance was conducted in the Persian Gulf, that Administration officials issued a statement saying Iraq had acceded to their demands.
"All available evidence indicates that Iraq is acceding to the requirements of the coalition's Jan. 6 demarche," the White House statement said.
"No Iraqi aircraft have entered the no-fly zone south of the 32d parallel and the Iraqi surface-to-air missiles have been dispersed and are no longer threatening coalition flight operations."
Iraq had deployed about half a dozen SA-3 missile batteries and a smaller number of SA-2 missile batteries near the town of Al Amarah, where they were used to cover jets flying in the no-flight zone. Most of the missile batteries were drawn from north of the 32d parallel, which marks the northern boundary of the air exclusion zone. At least one SAM missile battery was also moved from Basra, where it was stationed when the air exclusion zone went into effect.
 
Concerned About New Missiles
 The United States was particularly concerned about the deployment of the new missiles. Some officials said they believed that the missile batteries had been deployed as a trap while other officials said they believed that the weapons were intended to inhibit the United States and allies from enforcing the no-flight zone. By packing up and dispersing the missiles, Iraq has removed that immediate threat.
Administration officials said the White House statement, asserting that the Iraqi leader had "backed down" in the face of allied demands, was intended to humiliate President Saddam Hussein of Iraq by portraying him as compliant and weak.
 
Situation Called Complex
 But some American officials, who asked not to be named, said the actual situation was more complex. The ultimatum delivered to the Iraqis on Wednesday demanded that all of the Iraqi missiles that were recently moved into new positions in the south "be returned to their original sites or configurations within 48 hours."
One American official who insisted on anonymity said that not all of the surface to air missiles had been located by American intelligence and that it was not clear if all of them were being returned to their original locations. The White House statement implied as much by warning that the United States would keep Iraq's military activities under close scrutiny and strike without warning if it deemed the missiles posed a future threat.
Thus the defusing of the showdown over the missiles does not mean that the confrontation between Baghdad and Washington is over.
Even as it moved the missiles, Baghdad set off a new confrontation with the West by banning all flights by United Nations weapons inspectors on United Nations aircraft inside Iraq. The United Nations Security Council has declared the Iraqi ban a "material breach" of its obligations under the resolutions that ended the Persian Gulf war.
 
Questions of Sanctions
 In stating that United Nations teams would no longer be allowed to fly into Iraq on United Nations planes, Iraqis are trying to force the United Nations inspectors to use chartered Iraqi planes.
To use Iraqi planes an exception would have to be made to the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq, which ban flights of Iraqi commercial aircraft outside Iraq. In condemning the Iraqi move, the Security Council condemned it as "clearly an attempt to impede" the United Nations inspections.
A senior Bush Administration official said that the Iraqi ban on United Nations flights was "potentially no less serious than what was talked about in the Jan. 6 demarche," which was the message demanding that Iraq's surface-to-air missiles be moved. This official said that he could not rule out that military force might again be threatened to try to compel Baghdad to comply.
The Iraqi ban on United Nations flights was the latest in a series of steps that Baghdad has taken to frustrate the inspections. According to a report issued last month by the United Nations, Iraq has not provided all the information that inspectors has sought on it programs to develop weapons of mass destruction.
 
Leaving With Documents
 In one recent inspection, a team of nuclear inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency who went to a site to look for documents found people leaving with documents.
"Upon arrival of the team, persons left the buildings carrying documents, despite the protests of the chief inspector," the United Nations report notes. "While the Iraqi counterparts promised to return the documents, and indeed did produce some, the inspectors were unable to verify that these were the documents taken from building."
Robert Gates, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, has said that Iraq is continuing the efforts to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
Iraq's frustration of the United Nations inspection effort is not the only source of concern. According to a United Nations commission on border demarcation, the Kuwait and Iraq boundary is to be moved north. United Nations border monitors have told the Iraqis that the boundary should be in force by Jan. 15, an Administration official said. In the meantime, Iraqi soldiers have also been crossing the newly demarcated Iraq-Kuwait border and destroying structures that are to end up on the Kuwaiti side of the line.
 
Relief Official Slain
 And last week, a official with the CARE relief organization was shot and killed. While the group has said it has no evidence that the killing was arranged by the Iraqi Government, Administration officials strongly suspect that Iraqi agents were responsible.
Iraq has continued to make public statements in a bellicose tone. Abdul-Jabbar Mohsen, the chief press secretary to the Iraqi leader, wrote in the official al-Jomhuriya daily in Baghdad that Iraqis "have no choice but to resist and fight for survival."
"The highest degree of preparation is required for an honorable holy war, the timing of which will be decided by our leadership," he said.
The pattern of Iraqi behavior suggests that Baghdad is likely to continue to test Washington in the early months of the Clinton Administration, on the assumption that Mr. Clinton wants to focus on his domestic agenda and does not share Mr. Bush's attitude toward Mr. Hussein.
 
Shwowing Its Power
 Baghdad may be trying to demonstrate that it is still a power to be reckoned with in the region, has the initiative in the foreign policy confrontations with the West and can provoke an international crisis almost at will.
By demonstrating his ability to create an international crisis, Mr. Hussein may be seeking to regain control over the Kurdish enclave in the north, to end the air-exclusion zones of its territory, to stop the United Nations inspections and to end the economic sanctions.
In issuing its statement, the White House said it hoped its threat to use force made clear that Iraqi interference with the United Nations and coalition operations would not be tolerated.
"I hope Saddam Hussein won't put us in this position again," President-elect Clinton said Friday night in Little Rock, Ark. "There is no point in it and he shouldn't do it, and it would be a serious misreading of our political system to think that just because President Bush has a week left in office, that either he or I would somehow be deterred from doing what's right here."

Though End of Recession Is Here, Prosperity Isn't Even Near Corner

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON, N.Y.

 BODY:
Amid strong signs that the recession was lifting its grip elsewhere in the nation, Martin A. Gardner braced against a cold wind here the other day, waited for his train to Manhattan and described the ordeal of being out of work for 20 months.
"Maybe, if I were a carpenter, I'd go to Florida," said Mr. Gardner, 55 years old, who has a doctorate in communications and 30 years' experience in advertising, sales and management. So far, he has sent 300 resumes to New York area companies. 
 "I'm optimistic," he said, but added that "there are an awful lot of us out here" looking for executive positions in New York City and its suburbs.
"New York has certainly lost some of its luster," he said.
 
Deep, Enduring Recession
 Mr. Gardner's problems finding work, despite his strong corporate credentials, are emblematic of the depth and enduring nature of the recession that has battered New York, New Jersey and Connecticut for four years. And his ambivalence about his own future comes at a time of sharply mixed signals about the economic prospects of the region.
Experts say there is some good news: The region's recession has finally hit bottom, or at least come close. The number of jobs in the region began to rise in November and December, and there are other signs of improvement, including a slight drop in office vacancies in midtown Manhattan.
But from Montauk to Trenton, and from New London to Atlantic City, the economic landscape has forever changed from the robust years of the mid-1980's.
Compared with most parts of the nation, the region's downturn has been extraordinarily deep, bringing huge job losses, a torrent of business failures and the worst real-estate slump in 50 years. Now, the analysts say, recovery will take five years or longer, and some segments of the regional economy will never regain their strength of the 1980's.
For thousands like Mr. Gardner -- out-of-work executives who once had high-paying jobs in the nation's largest concentration of banks, law firms, brokerage houses and corporate offices -- full recovery may never come. They are victims of a permanent reordering of the region's job market, in which technology has displaced many senior executives in the same way it once made assembly-line workers obsolete. Companies in almost every field are determined to do more with fewer employees.
In what has widely been described as the nation's first "white-collar recession," the carnage has been the worst within a 100-mile radius of midtown Manhattan, and it has not confined itself to white-collar workers. Connecticut has lost 12 percent of its jobs since the beginning of 1989; New Jersey has lost 9 percent and New York has lost 7 percent.
"Recovery is going to be a slow and painful affair," said Nicholas S. Perna, chief economist for the Shawmut National Corporation, a bank in Connecticut. "Sad to say, a lot of the jobs of the 1980's are just gone."
Still, there is widespread evidence that the worst has passed.
"New York City's recession came to an end during the summer of 1992," concluded a study in late December by the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University, where a team of economists analyzed what they called the "leading indicators" of the city economy, ranging from airport traffic to stock trading volume.
Others are less precise about timing, but no less confident that the recession has ended.
"The numbers clearly indicate that the tri-state region has turned the corner and is now poised for economic recovery," said Lou Salvatore, director of the New York office of Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, which surveyed 500 business owners in December. Seventy-five percent of the executives reported either stable or improved sales in 1992, and 66 percent had increased profits.
 
Christmas Cheer
 Glimmers of hope abound. Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Strauss and retailers in many suburban shopping malls say Christmas sales were the strongest in four years.
"Finally, people are spending money again," said Rick Marino, manager of Dodge auto sales at Stevens Auto Supermarket in Milford, Conn. His gauge of the recession is simple: beginning in late 1989, he said, most of his customers purchased used cars costing under $5,000; since July, most have been been buying new cars, typically costing over $15,000.
Some pockets of the regional economy are particularly robust. Heading the list is Wall Street, where stock brokerages and investment banking firms have compiled two years of rising profits, record trading volume and lofty executive bonuses, typically over $100,000.
In central New Jersey, home to the nation's largest concentration of pharmaceutical manufacturing, companies like Johnson & Johnson and Merck have been expanding rapidly. And 1992 was a successful year for Broadway, with rising attendance and growing income.
 
Hold Off on Celebration
 Still, experts warn against any surge of good cheer.
"There is reason for hope, but you have to place that on the canvas of what has happened over the last three years," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, New York regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "The job losses have been staggering."
According to the Federal Government, the metropolitan region lost 806,000 private-sector jobs from February 1989 to November, when employment rose slightly. The huge losses wiped out 12 years of gains, leaving the region with no more jobs than it had in 1976, when New York City was close to bankruptcy. Most of the losses were in manufacturing, construction, finance, and retail and wholesale trade. Service jobs and government work remained flat.
Despite the national scope of the recession, the Government said, 92 percent of the nation's job losses since the beginning of 1989 have been in 10 states, 9 of them in the Northeast: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. The lone outsider was California.
In the New York region, the downturn has been as wide as it has been deep. The cuts since 1988 have been almost equally divided between the city and the suburbs, which are now suffering harsh setbacks after attracting thousands of corporate offices and executive jobs over the last two decades.
Even more important, economists say, is the range of industries that have been damaged by business failures and lost jobs.
 
Manufacturing
A Painful Plunge In a Long Decline
 For manufacturers, the recession has turned a long, relentless period of decline, beginning in the 1950's, into something closer to collapse. The Government said 270,000 manufacturing jobs, 24 percent of the region's total, have been eliminated since November 1987, with the pace of decline showing no sign of subsiding.
The most recent jolt came last week, when International Business Machines, based in the Westchester County suburb of Armonk, said it would eliminate 3,500 jobs at its plants in Peekskill, Kingston and Poughkeepsie, N.Y. That announcement came two weeks after the company said it would lay off 25,000 workers around the world, acknowledging that a major share of its market for mainframe computers had been overtaken by other companies that make personal computers and small work stations.
I.B.M.'s bad news came a year after General Motors said it would close the largest factory in the region, its assembly plant in North Tarrytown. The closing, by 1996, will eliminate 3,400 jobs.
Elsewhere in the region, manufacturers have fallen prey to problems that have stalked them for decades: wages that are far higher than in other regions and abroad, and the cost of maintaining old, inefficient plants.
 
'Nothing to Cheer About'
 But since the recession began in 1988, one of the last large segments of the region's manufacturing economy -- the military suppliers of Long Island and Connecticut -- have had a new problem to contend with: the sudden decline in the Government's military spending.
"I see nothing to cheer about in 1993," said Greg Frisby, the chief executive of Frisby Airborne Hydraulics in Freeport, L.I. His company, which has produced fighter-jet parts for more than 30 years, is struggling to find non-Government markets for its products.
Frisby, with 85 workers, now makes hydraulic parts for commercial aircraft, supplying the Boeing Company, the Beech Aircraft Company and others that are themselves being hurt by weak demand for finished aircraft. Mr. Frisby said sales of his company's parts, weak in 1992, will be weak again in 1993, but should rise in 1994 as the national economic recovery gains momentum.
 
Surprising Bright Spot
 One unlikely corner of optimism among manufacturers is among small and specialized garment makers, the stubborn survivors of a far larger garment industry that until the 1960's supported huge plants in New York City and New Jersey, but has since faded almost into extinction.
"The signs have turned quite encouraging," said Ralph Shomer, owner of the Young American Clothing Company, which employs 52 immigrants from Portugal in an industrial loft in downtown Newark. Because of intense competition from garment makers in the Far East and Mexico, he had planned to close his company this year.
But now, he said, Young American has had a sudden increase in orders, mainly because his small plant, which specializes in women's coats, can turn them out for American buyers more quickly than its foreign competitors. Retailers, who have been caught off guard by a sudden increase in consumer demand, are turning to Mr. Shomer for help.
Instead of closing, he said, he may hire more workers. "It looks to me," he said, "like 1993 will be a good year."
 
White-Collar Careers
Lawyers, Bankers And Job Searches
 The most damaging legacy of the recession in the region, economists say, may be its impact on the same industries that were responsible for much of its growth in the 1980's.
Law firms, accounting firms, advertising agencies, management consulting firms, banks, real-estate brokerages and corporate headquarters have long given the region the nation's highest concentration of finance and professional services, and its highest paid work force.
"Our strengths have become our weaknesses," said Irwin Kellner, chief economist for the Chemical Banking Corporation of Manhattan. "Five years from now, even though the economic climate will be brighter, we will look back and see permanently lower levels of employment."
 
All Segments Vulnerable
 Since Chemical Bank merged in December 1991 with Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, Chemical has eliminated 5,438 workers, many of them professionals in finance, commercial lending and real estate.
Government data show that companies in the region engaged in finance, insurance and real-estate sales have shed 72,000 jobs since November 1987, or 8 percent of their total, and that other large cuts have been made in fields, like law and accounting, that had been considered the least vulnerable to recession.
At one of New Jersey's largest law firms, Greenbaum, Rowe, Smith, Ravin & Davis, based in Woodbridge, Paul Rowe, the managing partner, said the extent of the downturn was underscored for him late last year, when he was stopped for speeding near East Hampton, L.I.
When Mr. Rowe told the officer that he was a lawyer, the patrolman responded that he too was a law school graduate but could not find work as a lawyer. (Mr. Rowe didn't get a ticket.)
"In the 1980's, the mere thought that law firms would stop growing never popped into anybody's minds," said Mr. Rowe.
 
Some Losses Permanent
 Although a recovery is certain to bring back some of the professional jobs, the experts say some of the losses will be permanent. One reason is technology, which has made many jobs obsolete. While phone mail systems have displaced telephone clerks, and fax machines have claimed central spots in most mail rooms, corporate executives have turned increasingly to tele-conferencing systems and computers to cut the time and expense of management.
"The New York region will epitomize the corporate philosophy of the 1990's," Mr. Kellner said. "Companies will do more with fewer people."

 
 
Real Estate
Reaching Bottom Is Called Victory
 Executives say the prospects for recovery are the weakest in the region's real-estate industry, particularly among the developers and landlords of commercial office space. Despite a slight improvement in 1992, vacancy rates in Manhattan remain above 10 percent. And in some suburbs, including Fairfield County and northern New Jersey, vacancies are over 20 percent -- among the highest in the nation.
The downturn "has been so deep that any signs that we have reached bottom have to be considered a victory," said Hugh Kelly, director of economic research for Landhauer Associates, a real-estate consulting firm in Manhattan. And because of the vast surplus of office space, he said he did not expect a full recovery until 1998.
The market for homes and condominiums shows stronger signs of recovery. Although the inventory of unsold homes remains huge and prices have declined by as much as a third across the region, experts say there is pent-up demand among buyers who have been waiting out the recession and hoping to take advantage of low interest rates.
Still, no one is predicting a sudden upswing in sales.
"Buyers are still scared to death," said Carl Peek, a broker in the Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill sections of Brooklyn, two enclaves of brownstones that attracted waves of affluent buyers during the 1980's.
"The same kind of people who would have been anxious to buy five years ago now say they want to rent, and rent at the lowest price they can," he said. "We are a long way from out of the woods. I think it will take at least five years."
 
Wall Street
On the Way Back After Crash of '87
 Perhaps the single brightest segment of the region's economy is Wall Street. Since the stock market collapse of Oct. 19, 1987, which economists say led the region into its long recession, business has largely rebounded for stock brokerages and others in the securities industry.
According to the Securities Industry Association, a trade group that represents all members of the New York Stock Exchange, the industry has grown steadily for two years. Trading volume on the exchange reached records in both 1991 and 1992, and profits of member firms hit new highs in both years.
But even Wall Street has so far failed one crucial test of a recovery. New York City brokerage houses and investment banking firms laid off 38,000 workers between the stock market collapse of October 1987 and January 1992, but have restored fewer than 4,000 of those jobs, despite the robust business over the last year.
"Wall Street is to New York what the oil industry is to Houston, and it is now this region's strongest sector," said Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "My hunch is that those big salaries and bonuses have been used over the last two years for savings and to reduce personal debt. The big question for the region in 1993 is whether people on Wall Street will become bigger consumers."
 
Different Indicators
 Some executives find reason for optimism in unusual measures of the economy's performance. For instance, a study was conducted recently by a research team at Columbia University, which dispensed with past methods of analyzing economic trends and instead looked at things like the number of passengers traveling through the region's three major airports, trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange, stock prices and retail sales.
Some demonstrated little or no improvement by the summer of 1992, when the Columbia team now says New York City's recession ended, but most make clear that "a slow to moderate recovery has begun."
"Recoveries never take place in a straight line," said Anirvan Banerji, a member of the Columbia team. "You take two steps forward and one step back. But it has begun."
One indication of the region's strength is that its huge network of corporate executives and professionals do not see better prospects elsewhere. Although their companies and industries are mired in a long, slow period of recovery, many say they are determined not to leave.
One is Mr. Gardner of Hastings-on-Hudson. "The way I see it, the problems in the economy are nationwide," he said. "For me, New York is still the place to be."

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: The Banking Industry;
Bankers Lining Up Lobbyists Tightly Aligned With Clinton

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
In a striking example of how an interest group can lay the groundwork to influence the Government, the banking industry has assembled a powerhouse team to take on the Clinton Administration and the new Congress.
The bankers are keenly interested in seeing banking regulations relaxed and in being allowed to branch out across state lines and to compete more directly against securities firms. They are also watching carefully to see if new consumer protections will be enacted. 
 The industry's biggest lobbying organization, the American Bankers Association, has lined up bankers and lobbyists who have been closely associated with President-elect Bill Clinton and who wield great influence in the Democratic Party.
 
Challenge to Special Interests
 At the same time, people who worked for Mr. Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas, advised his Presidential campaign and the transition team or have close ties to the banking industry are also under consideration by the new Administration for crucial regulatory posts.
Mr. Clinton has repeatedly promised to challenge the special-interest groups that seek to turn campaign contributions and political connections into influence over public policy. "I think there is going to be a great reluctance by the Administration to let the banking lobbyists be effective," said one banking lawyer who has advised the Clinton organization.
But since the election, Mr. Clinton has been criticized for accommodating lobbyists and power brokers as he assembles his economic team and designs his economic policies.
The lobbying team also faces an uphill fight in Congress: lawmakers have little appetite for undoing provisions of the 1991 banking bill that the industry has complained bitterly about. That law makes many new demands on bankers, setting standards for how much capital they must have on hand and what kind of risks they can incur.
The bankers association recently named to its board Curt Bradbury, head of Worthen National Bank, an Arkansas institution that has long provided financial support for Mr. Clinton's political aspirations and lent the Clinton campaign millions of dollars at crucial junctures in the campaign.
Even before the election, the association named as its new president William Brandon, an Arkansas banker who has known Mr. Clinton for many years.
Shortly after the election, the association hired two prominent lawyers with close ties to Mr. Clinton. One was Charles Manatt, a former banker and Democratic Party chairman who was co-chairman of the Clinton campaign and whose law partner is the campaign's director, Mickey Kantor, whom Mr. Clinton has selected as the United States trade representative. The other was Thomas Boggs, an influential lobbyist whose law partners include Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic Party chairman, who has been chosen to be Commerce Secretary.
"The A.B.A. rightly thinks that it is time for an enlightened rethinking of several banking issues, including the regulatory burden and structural issues," Mr. Bradbury said in an interview on Thursday. "You see here the precursors of a pretty good lobbying campaign."
Mr. Manatt said Friday that like Mr. Boggs he had been retained by the banking association to lobby Congress to ease regulations that the bankers consider burdensome, a role he called "perfectly appropriate." He said he would not lobby the Clinton Administration or its regulatory agencies, an effort that will fall primarily to Edward Yingling, the association's full-time lobbyist. (Mr. Yingling was once an aide to Senator J. W. Fulbright of Arkansas.)
And a leading candidate to become Mr. Clinton's point man on banking, either as Comptroller of the Currency or as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, is Mr. Clinton's chief of staff in the Arkansas Governor's office, William Bowen, a banker and former chairman of the First Commercial Corporation of Little Rock.
 
Getting Clinton's Ear
 Industry leaders believe they have already got Mr. Clinton's attention. Easing regulations, they say, would spur lending to small businesses, helping economic recovery without costing the Government anything.
At the December economic meeting in Little Rock, Mr. Clinton asked Mr. Brandon to describe the stimulative effects that might be gained by relaxing certain bank regulations. The banker's remarks were warmly received by Mr. Clinton, who has said repeatedly that the rules make it costly for banks to make loans to small businesses and reward them for investing in Government securities instead.
But the House and Senate banking committees are tilting away from the industry. The committees have been assigned newly elected members who are more attuned to spurring lending in impoverished cities than they are to changing the capital standards that apply to banks or to allowing greater interstate banking.
Banks are also focusing on several major revisions of banking standards imposed by the year-old Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act, Congress's response to the wave of bank failures in recent years.
For example, under the law, regulators are devising "trip wires" to identify problems with audits, with the documentation of collateral for risky loans and with other flaws that contribute to the bank failures.
In some areas the banks have defensive battles to fight. For example, it is widely expected that the securities industry and its allies in Congress and in regulatory agencies will campaign against allowing banks to increase their securities business.
On several other issues, including restrictions on interstate banking, the banking industry is deeply divided.
 
Advisers With Industry Ties
 Among the members of the Clinton economic team who have ties to the banking and securities businesses are Roger C. Altman, the choice for Deputy Treasury Secretary, who is now vice chairman of Blackstone Group, an investment banking firm on Wall Street, and Robert E. Rubin, the co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, who is to head the new National Economic Council.
Mr. Clinton's top advisers are also being aided by people with close ties to the banking industry.
H. Rodgin Cohen, who is playing an advisory role, is a partner in Sullivan & Cromwell, which has represented many major banks, including Bank of America. Eugene Ludwig, a partner at Covington & Burling, which represents Nationsbank, the fourth-largest American banking company, heads a working group making recommendations on banking regulations. And Cantwell F. Muckenfuss 3d of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher represented the financier Ronald O. Perelman when he bought five failed Texas savings institutions. The Wall Street Journal reported their roles last month.
Mr. Muckenfuss, a former official of the F.D.I.C. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, was mentioned on Friday by American Banker, a trade publication, as one of several candidates being considered for chairman of the F.D.I.C.
Another possible choice is Karen D. Shaw, a Washington banking consultant who advised the campaign and who, along with Mr. Manatt, worked hard to assemble support for the campaign from commercial bankers, an effort that produced only modest success.
Terrence J. Murray, chairman of Fleet Financial Group Inc., a Rhode Island banking company, supported Mr. Clinton early in the campaign and met with him several times; Hugh L. McColl, chairman of Nationsbank, endorsed Mr. Clinton near the end of the campaign. Both men advocate expanding the authority of banks to operate across state lines.
Mr. Clinton must make an appointment by the end of February.

HEADLINE: A Harsh Start to a New Beginning for Winnowed Daily News

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
After two days of canceled editions, missed deadlines and other disruptions caused by a change in ownership and the dismissal of scores of reporters, editors and other staff members, news operations at The Daily News returned to near normal yesterday as a smaller staff got out a full Sunday newspaper.
But problems of adjustment were expected to linger. With a smaller staff, news assignments will be made more carefully, editors said. And to minimize problems during the staff's transition this week, publication of the Brooklyn, Queens and suburban sections has been suspended for five days, starting tomorrow. 
 Some of those who lost their jobs in a sweeping economy move by the new owner, Mortimer B. Zuckerman, returned yesterday to The News offices at 220 East 42d Street to clean out their desks and say farewell to colleagues who remained on the job.
"The mood?" said one editor, who insisted upon anonymity. "There aren't enough of us here to have a mood." Asked if the daily routines of putting out the paper were returning to normal, he said: "It's been so long since anything has been normal around here that it's hard to say."
James P. Willse, the newspaper's editor, acknowledged that The News ran into a series of minor production and distribution problems Thursday and Friday as Mr. Zuckerman completed his $36.3 million purchase and began by dismissing 170 of 540 news, advertising and circulation employees represented by the Newspaper Guild of New York.
On both days, as discharged staff members were ordered out and those who remained were caught up in the turmoil, deadlines were missed and some articles by wire services were run in place of those normally written by staff members.
Mr. Willse said the management had anticipated that both days would be "fairly chaotic" and planned for it by canceling the paper's 48-page first edition, known as the national edition, which carries the news and editorial content of the regular paper, but no advertising. About 50,000 copies are distributed in areas beyond a 75-mile radius of New York City, he said.
Most of the technical problems were overcome yesterday as the normally smaller Saturday staff put out The Sunday News, and the national edition resumed full circulation.
But some editors said that with the news staff cut by a third and Mr. Zuckerman's plan to hire new employees weeks or months away, continuing problems were anticipated.
Editors said they would have to make assignments more carefully. "Before you commit a reporter and photographer to a fire in the depths of Brooklyn," said one editor, "you have to let it go to four alarms. When we had a plethora of reporters and photographers, you didn't have to do that."
Mr. Willse acknowledged that problems would arise. "But we've been through this before," he said. "You just reshuffle the guard and do the best you can."
Mr. Zuckerman, in a letter to readers in today's edition, promised new columnists and features and a Daily News that would be "tough, sassy, full of outrage at injustice and street smart." And he said that layoffs had been required to save The News, which lost $100 million in the last decade and has been in bankruptcy for 13 months.
 
Guild Plans Boycott
 Barry F. Lipton, president of the guild, said yesterday that a reader and advertiser boycott of The News and a broader campaign against other Zuckerman properties to win back jobs, salaries and benefits would be in full swing sometime this week. The guild set aside $100,000 for the fight and hired Ray Rogers, a labor consultant, to run the boycott.
But other newspaper unions were not supporting the guild's effort. "That's like shooting yourself in the foot," said George E. McDonald, president of an umbrella group of newspaper unions. "We want to save the paper, not kill it."

HEADLINE: Price of European Unity Is Reckoned in Lost Jobs

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LILLE, France

 BODY:
Few towns are better placed than this northern French industrial capital to benefit from Europe's push for unity. The Channel Tunnel and high-speed rail links will soon put Paris, Brussels and London within 90 minutes. Blue-and-gold European flags, a new train station conceived as a European hub and a massive conference center called EuraLille demonstrate the point.
But in an example of the problems accompanying the establishment of a single European market on Jan. 1, all the fanfare has left the four million inhabitants of the Lille region cold. The billions of dollars spent on transport, the relentless promotion of the European ideal and the recent removal of border guards at the nearby Belgian frontier have all been overshadowed by a single fact: more and more people do not have jobs. 
 Indeed, battered by the decline of its coal, steel, textiles and shipbuilding industries, the region now has an unemployment rate of 13.3 percent -- almost double that of the United States and well above the French national figure of 10.3 percent. Asked to vote on European unity in a national referendum last September, people in the region here sent an unequivocal message that work comes before European dreams: 55.7 percent voted no.
The Lille region is not alone. Unemployment has become the scourge of Europe. About 14.6 million people, or 9.8 percent of the work force, are now out of a job, according to the European Commission in Brussels, the administrative arm of the European Community, compared with 13.3 million, or 9 percent, a year ago and 12.1 million in 1990. Companies, including Ford of Europe and International Business Machines, continue to slash thousands of jobs in Europe as the economic slump endures.
 
16 Million Jobless
 As a result, about 16 million people are expected to be jobless by the end of next year, when Europe's unemployment rate could hit 11 percent. In France alone, 3 million people are now without work; among people under 25 the country's unemployment rate is over 20 percent, according to European Community figures.
The Lille region's vote on the unity treaty, which went against a national result that narrowly favored European union, shocked the local authorities.
"We thought we had convinced people of the opportunities offered by Europe, but they just don't feel it," said Jean-Claude Aurousseau, the prefect, or top state official, in Lille. "When people are out of a job, it's hard to convince them that Europe offers them a chance. Instead, they see Europe as a threat. They say, Europe's done nothing for me, so what will it do for my children?"
The consequences of Europe's unemployment are already widely felt. Instead of the optimism that was expected to accompany the creation of a borderless market of almost 350 million people, insecurity and mounting racism appear to be Europe's dominant sentiments. Such feelings in turn feed the rise of extreme right-wing movements, now growing in several European countries, especially those like Germany and France with large numbers of immigrants.
"I try to tell workers that the single market will eventually create jobs and opportunities," said Bruno Creton, a labor expert in Lille. "But all I hear is how immigrants and competition will take away more jobs."
 
Job Mobility Hits a Wall
 Such grim popular sentiment is not surprising. European integration was supposed to stimulate employment by promoting job mobility across a vast area, inspiring investment by companies able to sell into a much larger market and stimulating growth.
But the effect, since the boom of the 1980's ended, has been markedly different. Faced by the combined impact of a world economic slowdown and the increased competition stemming from the creation of a single market, companies in Europe have been cutting back in ways that seem likely to be lasting. Meanwhile, barriers of language and culture have meant that job mobility has proved to be largely an illusion. Just two million European Community citizens work permanently in other community countries.
As in the United States, recent job cuts have hit not only manufacturing but also white-collar and service-sector employees, who had been relatively immune to past recessions.
"Job separations may be more permanent than in past downturns," the 24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development stated in a recent report. Asserting that American companies are cutting jobs to insure greater competitiveness in a tougher world economy, the organization said, "There may be a similar pattern to layoffs in Europe."
 
Treaty Could Worsen Problem
 Moreover, the Treaty on European Union, signed 13 months ago in the Dutch town of Maastricht, threatens to worsen unemployment. As a prelude for the planned introduction of a single currency in 1999, it calls on all 12 member countries to balance their budgets and eliminate inflation.
Thus, just as President-elect Bill Clinton is limited in his economic options by the size of the United States deficit, European governments are effectively constrained from giving fiscal boosts to their economies -- and thereby creating jobs -- by the need to reduce their budget deficits to meet the demands of the Maastricht treaty.
"Maastricht is deflationary and anti-employment," said Jean-Pierre Chevenement, a French politician who opposed the treaty. "It gives no hope to those without work."
At the Valdunes steel plant in Valenciennes, a town 35 miles from Lille where unemployment is running at 17.7 percent, the effect of job cuts is sharply apparent. About 340 people work at this factory producing wheels for trains, half the number there were a decade ago. At a neighboring steel plant, all 6,000 jobs have disappeared. Rusting debris, scrap metal and a half-capsized blast furnace litter the landscape.
"The only people who have done well out of this area recently are the scrap-metal merchants," said Georges Herbin, a technician, as he surveyed a production line that has slowed almost to a standstill as result of slumping orders for the first quarter of 1993. "It seems the meat is for somebody else, and we are left with the bones."
 
Few Young Workers
 Mr. Herbin, who is 50, has been with the company 20 years and amounts to a survivor. Because of a long hiring freeze, 72 percent of the workers at Valdunes are now over 40, and just 2 percent are under 25. Such freezes, often prompted in part by the high cost to employers of medical, social security and other payments for full-time workers, have had a devastating effect on employment prospects for the young in Europe.
The steel industry job losses in the Lille area result in part from European integration. As borders have come down, the Continent's overcapacity has been evident, and pressure has increased from the community's Executive Commission in Brussels to eliminate state subsidies and close plants that are not viable in the open market.
In the Lille region, over 30,000 steel and metalworking jobs have been eliminated in the last decade, as well as over 50,000 jobs in a textile industry that was once a world leader but is now unable to compete with cheaper plants in Southeast Asia. The coal industry, which employed over 200,000 people in the 1950's, has disappeared because it was uncompetitive, and a shipbuilding plant in Dunkirk has been closed.
"In the last 10 years, this region has lost 140,000 industrial jobs," said Richard Merlen, an economist at the national statistics office in Lille. "New jobs, mainly in the service sector, have partly compensated, but we still have a net loss of 60,000 jobs."
 
Threat From East Europe
 At the Valdunes plant, the latest threat is cheap competition from Eastern Europe. Michel Cassou, a director, said factories in what was formerly Czechoslovakia with much lower wage costs were offering wheels at 30 percent below the prices of the French manufacturer. This threat has contributed to a devastating 20 percent fall in in orders for next year and feeds resentment among workers now facing possible layoffs.
When an economic upturn does arrive, perhaps in the second half of 1993, the current bleak outlook should lift somewhat. The European market, the world's largest, is certainly a stimulus for investment. Even in the current climate, Coca-Cola, Toys-R-Us, Haagen Dazs and American Can are among the companies that have recently opened plants in the Lille area.
Moreover, concerned by unemployment, European governments this month agreed on a multibillion-dollar growth package based around new spending on infrastructure like roads, bridges and telecommunications.
 
Need 10 Million Jobs
 But any substantial improvements still seem a long way off. With the labor pool growing as more women join the work force, it would take the creation of some 10 million jobs by the end of the century merely to cut European unemployment to current American levels, and nobody believes that is possible. The high costs to employers of full-time hires continues to feed a shift to part-time and temporary employment.
"Everyone is worried," said Mr. Aurousseau, the Lille prefect. "The other day I had a delegation of nurses in here complaining that Belgian nurses were going to take their jobs. I told them they could also work in Belgium, but they were unimpressed."
He said one basic fear shared by many people is that their children will not live better than they have. "When I got into a good school, my father told me I had my foot in the stirrup," the prefect said. "But today even highly educated young people in Europe are asking: where are the horses?"

HEADLINE: On Long Island, Little Girl Lost;
Even Before She Vanished, Katie's Plight Touched Hearts

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST ISLIP, L.I.

 BODY:
The last time Cathy Rossi saw Katie Beers was at 10:30 on a chilly October night in 1991. The 8-year-old girl had come over on her own to her neighbor's house to bid a tearful farewell.
A bank had foreclosed on the Beers family home here, in a tight-knit suburban neighborhood of split-level ranch homes and manicured lawns. Katie, who had already endured neglect, poverty and family fights, was being uprooted once again. 
 And on that cold night, the little girl, jacketless and shivering, wanted just one thing.
"I couldn't believe that she had come over alone that late," said Mrs. Rossi. "I tried to send her right back home. But she insisted she had to give me a hug and a kiss before she left."
Katie disappeared almost two weeks ago, two days before her 10th birthday, after a family friend said he had gone with her to a video arcade in Nesconset. The police do not know what happened to her and are looking for clues in her troubled past and difficult family situation, including the tug of war for custody between her mother and godmother and charges that the godmother's husband had sexually abused the girl.
Whatever the circumstances of her disappearance, interviews with friends, neighbors and county officials make one thing clear: Katie, kind and bright and hungry for affection, had already had far more than 10 years' worth of trouble in her life.
People who knew her said Katie frequently skipped school and often wandered the streets alone early in the morning and late at night. Children in one neighborhood where she lived would tease her, calling her "Dirty Katie" and "Roach Girl," because of the squalid condition of her home.
And as she moved from home to home in the last year, Katie's life veered from the poverty of her mother's apartment in Mastic Beach, where Katie, her mother and grandmother shared a bedroom, to the middle-class comfort of the home in Bay Shore where she lived with her godmother, Linda Inghilleri, and her husband, Sal. There she had her own bedroom, Barbie dolls, stuffed bunnies and a play vanity. But the authorities have also accused Sal Inghilleri of sexually abusing her.
The case has wrenched the hearts of Long Island parents, who have seen the pictures of the cute blond girl with rosy cheeks and a shy smile. Across the Island, it has frightened children, who have followed the story daily on television.
The public's concerns were heightened by the apparent inability of county social-service workers to help Katie, even though they had closely watched the family and knew that the girl was in a difficult situation.
 
She Wasn't Ready
 Marilyn Beers, 43 years old, admitted recently she was not prepared to raise a child on her own when she gave birth to Katherine Marie Beers. The father, whom she has refused to identify publicly, was "out of the picture," she said. Her first child, John, born six years earlier, had been raised by Miss Beers's parents, but her father had died and her mother was too old to resume such a burden.
There was not even anyone to drive Miss Beers home from the hospital, and she and her newborn girl had to take a cab, Miss Beers recalled. When she got to the house, where she herself had grown up, it had almost no baby supplies, and Miss Beers, an unemployed taxi driver, had no money to buy them. Her neighbor, Mrs. Rossi, remembered bringing over a used cradle and some old baby clothes.
While Mrs. Rossi and other neighbors described Miss Beers as a good-natured, generous woman, they added that she was too preoccupied with her own problems to watch Katie properly. Mrs. Rossi said that one winter morning, when Katie was still a toddler, she discovered the little girl in front of her house wearing only a diaper, breakfast food smeared on her face. No one in the Beers household had noticed that she was gone, Mrs. Rossi said.
 
Brief Stints at Home
 But for most of her first six years, Katie spent only brief stints at home. Instead, she was largely raised by Miss Beers's friend Mrs. Inghilleri, who says she tookher role of unofficial guardian almost by accident.
At a chance meeting about two months after Katie was born, Miss Beers told Mrs. Inghilleri she had a headache and asked her to baby-sit for a few hours, Mrs. Inghilleri said. "It changed from a few hours to a night to a few weeks to forever," she said. "Since then, I have nurtured her like a mother."
Sal Inghilleri, who is now 39, said there were few problems in the early years, until he suffered a heart attack in 1988, forcing the Inghilleris and Katie to move in, rent-free, with the Beers -- Marilyn, her son, John, and her mother, Helen -- in West Islip.
Mr. Inghilleri said the house was a "pigsty," infested with cockroaches, and had fallen into disrepair. Soon after they arrived, the ceiling over the den collapsed and the heater broke, he added.
"We were constantly fighting with them to get it fixed," Mr. Inghilleri said. "It was a very bad environment there. Katie had never lived in anything like that."
 
Children Teased Her
 Mrs. Rossi said this weighed heavily on Katie. Some parents in the neighborhood would not allow their children to play with her, Mrs. Rossi added.
But the girl remained friendly and was clearly independent. Several described her as "street smart" and said they would see her out by herself as late as 10:30 at the delicatessen around the corner. One neighbor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, recalled seeing Katie as a 7-year-old, hauling the family's dirty clothes to a self-service laundry.
Paul Bartley, 58, whose 10-year-old daughter, Linda, became friends with Katie last year, called the girl "street wise" and a "little rough around the edges," but basically a "normal, good kid." Linda Bartley said that Katie had once tried to get her to smoke a cigarette, "was fun to play baby dolls with" and was a "good friend."
Linda said she had been watching television news every night since Katie disappeared and cried when she first saw Katie's picture on the screen. She told her father that she would no longer walk down the block alone.
 
'CravedStarved for Attention'
 Another neighbor, Cynthia Vanderveer, 29, who lives across the street from Miss Beers's current home in Mastic Beach, said that the girl seemed starved for attention. She recalled how Katie clung to her leg and tugged at her shirt when she took Katie and her own daughter to a video store earlier this year. "Katie didn't want to let go," she said.
Mrs. Rossi said: "She was a very sweet, very bright girl who craved attention. She couldn't come near you without wanting a hug and a kiss."
"She's such a friendly kid that she would go off with anyone who was nice to her," she added.
Katie moved to her mother's one-bedroom apartment in Mastic Beach a year ago and seemed to have quickly become friends with a group of neighborhood children. Miss Beers said her daughter was happy, and her complaints were no different from those of any other girl her age.
But the move occurred as the quarrel between her mother and Mrs. Inghilleri over who would have custody of the girl grew more intense, and both said they told county officials that the other woman was not providing a sound environment for Katie.
An official involved in the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said social workers had been monitoring Katie's situation for the last two years and had observed a series of problems and a strange relationship between the godmother and the mother. "She is a needy child," he said. But while he acknowledged that there were problems at Katie's mother's house, he added that social workers had not thought that the child was in any "imminent risk" there.
After a bank foreclosed on the Beers's house in West Islip, Katie and her grandmother moved in with the Inghilleris. But in January of last year, Miss Beers, who had always been Katie's legal guardian, came and took them away, forcibly removing the girl, Mrs. Inghilleri said.
Mr. Inghilleri accused Miss Beers, who had been unemployed for long periods, of taking her daughter and her mother because she wanted access to Helen Beers's pension money and was jealous that her daughter preferred living with the Inghilleris. Miss Beers denied both accusations.
Meanwhile, Miss Beers told Suffolk County Children Protective Services that Katie had been sexually abused by Sal Inghilleri. Mr. Inghilleri was arrested 10 months later, in October, on felony sexual abuse charges and has pleaded not guilty. He is scheduled for trial in February, and the Suffolk County District Attorney's office has ordered him to have no contact with Katie.
Despite the accusations, Miss Beers continued to allow Katie to visit the Inghilleris, letting the girl spend the month of August there as well as frequent weekends. Miss Beers said she thought that Mr. Inghilleri was separated from his wife and no longer living in the house. While Mr. Inghilleri said that the two were separated for financial reasons, he said their marriage was intact and that he frequently stayed at the house in Bay Shore.
Katie, in fact, had spend the weekend with the Inghilleris before her disappearance on Dec. 28. She had been picked up by a longtime family friend, John Esposito, who said the girl disappeared about 4:30 P.M., minutes after he took her to the Space Plex video arcade in Nesconset. Mr. Esposito, who pleaded guilty about 15 years ago to charges of unlawful imprisonment of a 12-year-old boy, has been questioned by the police, who have been unable to find witnesses to corroborate his account.
Mrs. Inghilleri had also complained to Children Protective Services that Miss Beers was an unfit mother. For example, she said, Katie had head lice this fall, a common affliction among schoolchildren, and then had failed to attend school for weeks.
Mrs. Inghilleri complained that Miss Beers's one-bedroom apartment, a converted garage, was unhealthy. When a reporter visited recently, the floor was covered with trash, piles of dirty clothes and dozens of empty sarsaparilla bottles. The phone was disconnected and the bedroom light did not work. Katie's empty Christmas stocking was still hanging on the wall by the Christmas tree.

HEADLINE: Rostenkowski Inquiry Widens, Lawyers Say

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Eight months after Federal prosecutors subpoenaed Representative Dan Rostenkowski's expense records as part of their inquiry into the House post office, the investigation has steadily grown into a broad review of the Congressman's public and private finances, lawyers involved in the case said today.
The grand jury investigation involving Mr. Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the House tax-writing committee, began in May, focusing on his purchase of stamps from the House post office. 
 The lawyers said the prosecutors suspected that someone in Mr. Rostenkowski's office, along with employees at the poorly run mail service, stole cash from the post office, disguising the thefts as a stamp purchases. Investigators have been examining the post office since mid-1991 when they learned that a clerk had traveled to Puerto Rico on a stolen money order.
But in a series of steps taken since the Election Day, a team of prosecutors headed by Jay B. Stephens, the United States Attorney here, has subpoenaed nearly 20 aides, including nearly all of Mr. Rostenkowki's current and former employees at his offices in Washington and Chicago to testify to the grand jury along with some employees of the Ways and Means Committee.
 
What Prosecutors Suspect
 Prosecutors appear to suspect Mr. Rostenkowski himself of possible misconduct and have sought his personal financial records as well as records from his campaign organization, the lawyers said.
In a report today on the widening inquiry, The Washington Post quoted Mr. Rostenkowski as saying that he is not a target of the investigation. In an interview with the newspaper, he complained about news leaks about the inquiry, insisting that no evidence against him had been uncovered. "They don't have anything, but it makes me look guilty," he said.
Mr. Rostenkowski has agreed to pay the legal bills of several of his aides who have been summoned to testify, including some staff members who have resisted efforts to testify to the grand jury without a grant of immunity from prosecution, the lawyers said. Mr. Rostenkowski's own lawyers, Abbey D. Lowell and Stanley M. Brand, obtained another lawyer's legal opinion saying the arrangement was proper.
But prosecutors are said to be angered by the practice, questioning whether the Congressman has bought his subordinates' silence, an assertion that Mr. Rostenkowski's lawyers and lawyers representing his aides deny, pointing out that Mr. Stephens has obtained testimony of several of the lawmaker's aides.
Although Federal law enforcement officials have said they are pursuing solid leads, it is not at all clear if they have any concrete evidence tying Mr. Rostenkowski or any of his aides to a crime.
 
$55,000 Worth of Stamps
 Public records show that Mr. Rostenkowski's campaign and Congressional offices purchased more than $55,000 worth of stamps in recent years, and former staff members have said they did not recall ever seeing postage stamps purchased in such quantities. Mr. Rostenkowski has never explained the large volume of stamp purchases, except to assert that his office mailed a large volume of correspondence without using the free mail privileges of his office.
Some lawyers who have followed the case have said that the expansion of the inquiry may not signal gathering momentum, but that prosecutors are resorting to a scattershot approach in a final effort to bring a criminal case against the lawmaker after months of futile digging.
Mr. Rostenkowski's allies on Capitol Hill have questioned Mr. Stephens's motives, suggesting that the Republican official was trying to complete his tenure as the top prosecutor in Washington with a case against an important Democrat who is likely to figure prominently in economic and health-care policy in the new Clinton Administration.
Mr. Stephens, who has denied any political motivation in any of his prosecutorial efforts, also supervised the investigation of former Washington Mayor Marion Barry.
That case used a hotly debated sting in which Mr. Barry was lured to a hotel room by a former women friend and arrested while smoking crack cocaine.
In July, prosecutors summoned Mr. Rostenkowski to testify, but he refused, citing his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. At the time, he offered to talk informally with investigators, but they declined.
At the time, it appeared the investigation was building toward a potentially serious case, as prosecutors appeared to be working up the chain of command at the post office, obtaining guilty pleas from several clerks and their superiors.
Their cooperation seemed to lead to the subpoenas for the records of Mr. Rostenkowski and two other Democratic lawmakers, Austin Murphy and Joe Kolter, both of Pennsylvania. But so far no elected official has been formally accused of any wrongdoing.

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: The Labor Department;
Nominee Devoted Years To Rehearsing for Role

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Robert B. Reich will no doubt be the first Secretary of Labor who ever staged a production of The Fantasticks.
And he is probably the first to serve as a top economic adviser to three Democratic Presidential candidates, and the first to write seven books in 10 years. 
 Everything about Mr. Reich -- his love of the theater, his hyperkinetic intellect, his close and longstanding friendship with the President-elect -- suggests that he will not play Labor Secretary as a bit role.
 
Top Supporting Actor
 Indeed, President-elect Bill Clinton has cast Mr. Reich (pronounced REISH) in what might prove to be a leading role, implementing one of the new President's fundamental economic strategies: improving the skills of the nation's workers.
Mr. Reich, a 46-year-old lecturer on public policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, has devoted much of his adult life to that cause, churning out books and articles about how Americans are ill prepared for the workplace of the 21st century.
"Global investors will come and create good jobs if we have a well-trained work force," he said in an interview. "I am interested in Americans gaining skills in computer technology, in biotechnology, not in learning how to produce buggy whips."
 
'Useful Intellectual Source'
 Though critics dismiss him as a pamphleteer and propagandist and point out that he is a lawyer and not an economist, Mr. Reich has shaped Democratic thinking on the economy more than any other academic in the last decade. Walter F. Mondale turned to Mr. Reich for advice during his 1984 Presidential campaign, as did Michael S. Dukakis in 1988.
But his advice made a more indelible mark on Mr. Clinton, who was with him at Oxford University when both were Rhodes Scholars and was a classmate at Yale Law School.
"Nobody dominates Bill Clinton, but Bob has had a very significant influence on him," said John Isaacson, a Boston executive who was a Rhodes Scholar with the two men. "He has been a very useful intellectual source for Bill and probably always will be."
Large parts of Mr. Clinton's Putting People First economic program seemed to be plucked out of Mr. Reich's latest book, "The Work of Nations" (Knopf, 1991). The book argues that improving America's work force and infrastructure like airports and highways is crucial to keeping and attracting high-paying jobs.
He was one of the main authors of Mr. Clinton's economic program, the centerpiece of which was spending $220 billion over the next four years to improve the infrastructure and job skills. When Mr. Reich was in a Boston hospital last June for a double hip replacement operation, Clinton aides in Little Rock faxed him copies of the plan so he could review it as it was reworked.
 
Bonded by Chicken Soup
 The President-elect and Mr. Reich became fast friends on the ship to England for their Rhodes scholarships. Mr. Reich is fond of recounting how when he became seasick, a knock on his cabin door introduced him to an affable young Arkansan bearing chicken soup.
"They are two very similar kinds of minds and similar kinds of people," said Nancy Bekavac, a law school classmate who shared an apartment with Mr. Reich and two other friends in New Haven. "They both have first-rate analytical minds, but their communications skills are even better."
While Mr. Clinton is a champion political networker, Mr. Reich is an astute intellectual networker. He is a contributing editor to The New Republic, chairman of the board of the American Prospect, a liberal economics magazine, and a board member of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
In addition to churning out books and articles, Mr. Reich is a talented speaker who is frequently a guest on the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour and on various National Public Radio news programs.
 
Opposing Voices
 He has also attracted a number of critics. Not all of them are conservatives, and several point to his constant presence on newspaper Op-Ed pages and television as evidence of an outsized ego.
A far more serious assertion is that Mr. Reich is sloppy with facts and shifts his ideas from book to book.
"His use of statistics is abusive and demagogic," said George Gilder, an author who helped popularize conservative ideas during the Reagan era. "And I don't think he is very rigorous on domestic policy."
Last month a writer for The New Republic attacked a 1989 Reich article that had accused American companies of having little loyalty to their homeland. The Reich article had stated that when an American bought a Pontiac LeMans, $6,000 of the $20,000 paid to General Motors went to South Korea. At the time, a LeMans cost about $10,000, the New Republic article stated. It also asserted that Mr. Reich erred in writing that Honda's assembly plants in the United States ship about 50,000 cars a year to Asia. The real number turned out to be a fourth of that, The New Republic said.
 
'You Make Some Mistakes'
 Mr. Reich declined to discuss this criticism, but a longtime colleague, John D. Donahue, a professor at the Kennedy School dismissed it. "You process 20,000 facts a year, you make some mistakes," he said.
The New Republic article also criticized Mr. Reich for inconsistency. In the early 1980's, he was suspicious of Japanese investment in the United States, stating, "Americans working for foreign owners do not get the kind of technical learning they need."
But his newest book rejects the notion that Japanese companies keep their best jobs in Japan when they own American operations.
He has also changed his mind about industrial policy. A decade ago, he supported the vigorous use of tax incentives and job-training funds to aid promising young industries. He now balks at that approach, saying the Government should provide fertile ground for all.
 
Lacks Degree in Economics
 Mr. Reich denies that he has been intellectually inconsistent, insisting that like any good academic he has updated his views in response to changing circumstances.
His lack of a doctorate in economics, and the belief among some Harvard faculty that he plays loose with his facts and theories have prevented him from receiving a tenured professorship at the Kennedy School, several colleagues said. He was instead offered a lifetime contract for the lesser position of lecturer.
The lack of an economics degree also prevented him from attaining his goal of becoming Mr. Clinton's chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, although he directed Mr. Clinton's economic transition team.
Mr. Reich said that as Labor Secretary he hoped to pay special attention to Americans without college degrees. "The noncollege-educated worker is on a downward escalator," he said. "We have to try to change that."
 
'Dominant Figure on Campus'
 Mr. Reich was born in Scranton, Pa., and grew up in South Salem, N.Y., near the Connecticut border, where his parents ran a women's clothing store. Valedictorian of his high school class, he went on to Dartmouth, where he was student-council president. Although he was a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War, his classmates say he was more a conciliator than a confrontationist.
"I remember vividly at Dartmouth what a charismatic and galvanic person he was," said Mr. Isaacson, who was a Dartmouth classmate as well as a fellow Rhodes scholar. He was probably the dominant figure on campus."
When not protesting, he kept busy directing plays and writing theatre reviews. Some friends expected that he would become a producer or theater critic.
 
Small Physical Stature
 He did not have Bill Clinton's problems with the draft. When he showed up for his physical, he was disqualified for being too short at 4 feet 10 inches, a result of a rare spinal disease.
He jokes freely about his height, saying he was long on Mr. Clinton's short list and taunting conservative critics by asking how they could think a man so short could stand for Big Government.
After law school, he worked for the Solicitor General, Robert H. Bork, who had been one of his law professors at Yale, then moved to the Federal Trade Commission, where he became director of policy planning under President Jimmy Carter.
"He challenged a lot of the orthodoxies at the commission," said Michael Pertschuk, who was the trade commission's chairman at the time. "He left a lot of the staff people feeling uneasy, but that was partly his role."
 
Praised as Administrator
 Mr. Pertschuk said Mr. Reich did a good job administering a staff of 30. (At the Labor Department, he will oversee a staff of 18,000.) Mr. Reich's colleagues said he knew how to listen, how to delegate and how to inspire.
After Ronald Reagan was elected President, he joined the faculty at the Kennedy School. His wife, Clare Dalton, whom he met when she auditioned for a play he was directing at Oxford, teaches at Northeastern Law School. They have two sons, Adam and Sam.
Throughout his writings, Mr. Reich's dominant interest has been how to strengthen the nation's economy as it faces increased foreign competition.
 
Economic Divisions
 In his latest book, he says the United States population is divided into three economic levels: a thriving group consisting of people who process information, including corporate executives, lawyers, doctors and investment bankers; a languishing second group consisting of service-industry workers; and the hardest-hit group, blue-collar workers like employees of the steel and rubber industries, who have been crushed by foreign competition.
"All Americans used to be in roughly the same economic boat" he wrote. "We are now in different boats, one sinking rapidly, one sinking more slowly, and the third rising steadily."
In his view, education and job training can rescue those who are sinking.
Although his agenda differs from that of the labor movement, union leaders have applauded his selection.
"We believe that he can make a superb Secretary of Labor," said Thomas R. Donahue, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s secretary-treasurer. "We have always argued that we need a Secretary of Labor who will be listened to in the Administration, and it seems clear that he will be listened to."

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
When a Lawyer and Client Are Possible Rivals

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
When Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. denounced the economic and racial segregation of Connecticut's public school system in his State of the State speech last week, he did more than set a new legislative agenda for the General Assembly. He also threw a curve ball right at the state's Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, an ambitious Democrat who has made no secret of wanting to succeed Mr. Weicker next year as governor.
As the state's chief civil lawyer, Mr. Blumenthal has been defending Connecticut in a lawsuit filed by a group of public school students who say that racial isolation in the schools is a violation of the state's Constitution. Mr. Weicker, in a powerful speech full of moral thunderbolts, came down firmly on the side of the students and said the executive and legislative branches of government must take action. 
 By implication, that puts Mr. Blumenthal on one side of the issue and Mr. Weicker on the other, even though technically Mr. Blumenthal is still Mr. Weicker's lawyer at the trial, which began in State Superior Court in West Hartford last month. Mr. Blumenthal, a former volunteer legal counsel to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, was considered one of the more liberal members of the State Senate, where he served before until 1991.
Mr. Weicker has not even said for certain whether he will run for a second four-year term, though he has hinted that he may not.
 
Er, Um, Uh
 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo rarely seems discomfited or lackluster, particularly when he has the chance to speak to a crowd. And so people watching him deliver his 11th State of the State address last Wednesday in Albany were surprised to see him peering tentatively ahead several times.
Technical difficulties, the Governor said, combined with poor lighting.
"Three different times the thing just kind of disappeared," he explained later, comparing the words on the prompter screen he was watching to movie credits, where "the words come up very big and when they get to the top of the screen they fade away and then they get small and smaller, or they reverse direction."
Nonsense, said the prompter operator, Alfred Lettieri. Mr. Lettieri said his machine worked fine, but that the Governor, in departing from his text, had made a low-technology, old-fashioned error and simply lost his place.
"No one's better at speaking than the Governor," Mr. Lettieri said. "But if you ad lib, the hardest thing in the world is to come back to the prompter and pick it up."
 
Caribbean Constituency
 Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi, a veteran Queens legislator who is planning a second run for New York City comptroller this year, went to Puerto Rico with Mayor David N. Dinkins last week to celebrate the inauguration of the island's newly elected Governor, Dr. Pedro Rossello. But he he was clearly working on his own agenda.
In 1989 Mr. Hevesi lost in a four-way race to Elizabeth Holtzman. Ms. Holtzman ran very well among Hispanic voters, taking more than 55 percent of their votes. This time around, Mr. Hevesi is trying to making inroads among those voters, and he has persuaded Dennis Rivera, the politically powerful Hispanic head of the hospital workers union, to help him. Mr. Rivera also went to Puerto Rico.
"The Latino community is a crucial and vital constituency," Mr. Hevesi said. "They will be a major part of the coalition I intend to put together in the comptroller race.
Ms. Holtzman said through a spokeswoman that she was not worried about her Hispanic support. She did not attend the inauguration because she had longstanding plans to spend the New Year's weekend with her family, said the spokeswoman, Andrea Bernstein. Still, she does plan a Caribbean trip soon.
"She doesn't have anything on the schedule now, but chances are very good she will visit Puerto Rico before the year is out," Ms. Bernstein said.
 
Dial-a-Quote
 Bill Clinton's Presidential campaign popularized a gimmick last year in which reporters who were anxious for a personal quotation from the candidate could call and get a recorded statement from Mr. Clinton himself, speaking on the news topic of the day.
The 16 Republicans in the Connecticut Senate have now latched onto the idea. Perhaps their notion is that reporters could avoid an actual conversation with one of the senators, whose business and home telephone numbers are routinely printed by local newspapers as a public service.
Or perhaps they think the recorded messages are profound enough to rise above the clutter of other news.
Senator William A. Aniskovich, a Republican from Branford, and the minority president pro-tem in the Senate, said in his recorded message last week, for example, that he wants to "help the Republican Party form a message that restores the people's hope in the institutions of government and government's ability to solve problems."

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: The Fashion Scene;
More Inaugural Dresses Change Into Pumpkins

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Some will glitter, others will shimmer, certainly a few will trip on their unusually long hemlines. On inauguration night, nothing less than an absolutely elegant dress will do for the women lucky enough to land ball invitations.
But when the party is over, many of these dresses will go back where they came from -- the rental shop. 
 All over the country, women from a very select group are rushing on their lunch hours to dress rental shops to pick up something slinky, something scoop-necked, something full-skirted or something simple for this prom of all proms.
Men have been renting tuxedos for formal affairs since time began, and now women are taking their cue, renting dresses here and in other major cities for $100 or so that would cost them upwards of $1,000 to buy.
"I do not go to many functions," said Sandra Zweig, a 29-year-old television producer in New York. "It seemed to me kind of ridiculous to buy something that I would never wear again." Ms. Zweig said she had rented her strapless black gown from One Night Stand, a rental store on Madison Avenue near 72d Street, for $250. "I can't imagine how much this dress would have cost me to buy," she said.
 
'Very Good for Us'
 Joanna Doniger, owner of One Night Stand, said that 90 percent of her business over the last few weeks had been from women plowing through her 800 dresses each day, looking for something to wear to the balls. "Democrats tend not to have a wardrobe of evening dresses, and this has been very good for us," she said. "Why should they buy when they can rent something equally fab?"
One other advantage of renting a dress is that rental companies pick up the cleaning bills.
"Renting makes sense for an event where anything can happen," said Joan McGettigan, co-owner of Just One Affair in Washington. "People can bang into you with a drink or something. You never know. This way you won't have to worry about it."
As with most of these rental shops around the country, Miss McGettigan rents dresses from $70 to $300. With that comes a week with the dress, plus fitting, cleaning and minor alterations. Store owners around the country said that scooped necks and slim-fitting dresses had been very popular and that women were more concerned with a flattering fit than with the name of the designer on the label.
 
'The Frenzy Is On'
 While there are no hard numbers to back them up, most dress rental store owners said that four years ago renting for the inauguration was almost unheard of. "This just wasn't the thing to do here in Little Rock, , last time around," said Sharla Eudy, co-owner of Just For Tonight. "But we have been nonstop snowed in since the day of the election. I've got four ladies standing here right now for fittings. The frenzy is on."
The American Rental Association said renting formal wear to women is a fast-growing phenomenon. Janet Wynn Snyder, owner of Jandi Classics, a manufacturer and distributor of rental dresses in Knoxville, Tenn., said her business was up 70 percent since last spring. "Since the recession, people have had to adjust their priorities," she said. "They are renting for everything now.
"Just the other day," she said, "Our society column was going on and on about two emerald green dresses worn at a museum opening. We were so tickled because one of them was ours. The other was probably $5,000."
One of Mrs. Eudy's clients, Jill Huggins, said she could not care less if the whole world knew she rented from the shop, through she would not reveal who her date for the balls will be. "I have been all over town to look for dresses," she said. "I found two black gowns here for $175 apiece. I doesn't bother me if people know about it."
Retailers say they are not worried about the rental trend. Denise Greene, manager of the fine-dress department of Nordstrom's department store in McLean, Va., said the women who rent were those with very expensive tastes. "These are the women who want to wear a $2,000 gown but do not want to buy it," she said. "Middle-class and upper-middle-class women will still purchase."
Miss Greene predicted that nearly 75 percent of her January business would be from women attending inauguration balls.

HEADLINE: Martin Barell, 71, Who Headed State Board of Regents, Is Dead

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Martin C. Barell, who served as chancellor of New York State's Board of Regents from 1985 to 1992 and developed new programs amid controversy over education's failures and the effectiveness of his agency, died yesterday at his home in Glen Cove, L.I. He was 71.
He died of heart disease, his family said. 
Among the many issues that arose during Mr. Barell's tenure were debates over multiculturalism, coeducational athletics, urban school financing, the academic freedom to voice racially divisive views and school distribution of condoms to students to help prevent the spread of AIDS.
Soon after Mr. Barell took over as chancellor, the Regents came under attack from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and several legislators who said the board had failed to address high dropout rates, illiteracy and other education problems. The Governor said he was "incredibly unhappy" with the board, and some called for its abolition.
 
'Compact for Learning'
 Mr. Barell defended the board's record and vowed redoubled efforts, saying "we will, I'm sure, show results." In 1987 the Regents recruited Dr. Thomas Sobol as the state's new education commissioner and with him formed the 1991 "compact for learning."
That program is intended to improve education by imposing higher standards for students and giving local schools both more accountability for meeting the goals and more flexibility in the means they used.
Another innovation under Mr. Barell's tenure was the development of "community renewal schools." Several dozen model schools across the state are now open from early morning through the evening as community centers, with numerous activities and social services for children and adults.
The Board of Regents, the nation's oldest education agency, founded in 1874, has broad policy powers. It has general supervision over all public and private primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities, museums, libraries, historical societies, archives and vocational rehabilitation agencies. It also licenses and disciplines physicians, architects, engineers, dieticians, social workers, psychologists and members of 31 other professions.
 
Rejection of VouchersgFocus of Broad Powers
 Mr. Barell, elected a Regent by the State Legislature in 1976 at the age of 54, contested William A. Genrich for the chancellor's post in 1980 and lost. After Mr. Barell made amends, Mr. Genrich nominated him for vice chancellor in 1983. He succeeded Mr. Genrich on his retirement.
Under Mr. Barell's leadership, the Regents allowed girls on previously all-male teams, barred commercially sponsored classroom television programs and rejected a "voucher" proposal that would have allowed public payment of private school tuition. He said the plan would "aid and abet the liquidation of the public school system."
Mr. Barell helped broaden curriculum to include more about other cultures and the role of minorities. He said: "We ought to tell it like it is, and not gloss everything over."
But the Regents were embarrassed when Dr. Sobol commissioned a report that turned out to be racially provocative. It was prepared in part by Leonard Jeffries Jr., a City University professor who espouses black superiority. Further controversial remarks by Dr. Jeffries led critics to call on the board to renounce him. Mr. Barell urged it to refrain, saying, "This is not a macho organization. We don't want to stand tall."
 
Active in Civic Affairs
 When the Regents required an AIDS curriculum in 1987, he said, "Every child, regardless of what the community says, ought to have a minimum knowledge of AIDS." But in 1991 he defended the board's refusal to require schools to offer condoms, as recommended by the state AIDS agency.
In 1989 he assailed New York City's central school board and administration and suggested its dismantling. Later, in a reversal, he praised the initial efforts of the new city Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez.
Among his civic activities, Mr. Barell was chairman emeritus of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center, chairman of the Synagogue Council of America, past president of the Jewish Community Services of Long Island, a member of the National Commission for Unesco and an active Democrat.
The father of two institutionalized children, he supported organizations to help the handicapped and was a past president of the the Reece School for retarded and disturbed children. Nassau-Suffolk Services for the Autistic opened a school in Levittown, L.I., named for him.
 
Background in Law
 Mr. Barell was born in Brooklyn. He graduated from Columbia University and, after serving in the Army in World War II, graduated from Harvard's business and law schools.
In 1951 he cofounded a Manhattan law firm, Golenbock & Barell, where he specialized in real estate and business law. He was the firm's senior partner when it merged in 1990 with Whitman & Ransom, where he was of counsel.
His first marriage ended in divorce.
Surviving are his wife of 10 years, the former Phyllis Sotnick; two sons, Allan, of Manhattan, and Steven, of Langhorne, Pa.; four daughters, Deborah Spandorf of Queens, Marian Nelson of Falls Church, Va., Barbara Silpe of Lido Beach, L.I., and Naomi Barell of Jerusalem, Israel; two stepchildren, Lesly Steinman of Glen Head, L.I., and David Sotnick of Brooklyn; a sister, Gladys Barr of Oak Beach, L.I., and nine grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Reduced Dollars, Reduced Hope

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
What does it take to rescue a person from the despair and frustration of unemployment, homelessness, drug addiction or mental illness? Are these problems so overwhelming that their victims are condemned to spend the rest of their days in misery?
Voices from every corner of New York City -- from people like Patricia K. of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, who has battled depression, and Simon Rutledge of the South Bronx, who has AIDS -- would insist that the answer is no. These New Yorkers would describe how their lives have been transformed by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
 And from their stories might come a realization: it does not take a million dollars to save a person in crisis. Through hundreds of seemingly minor efforts, the seven charities assisted by the fund sow change across the city. It could be a visit from a social worker. A grant to stave off an eviction. Help in buying medication.
 
Decline Threatens Services
 But this year, the ability of the fund to aid thousands of New Yorkers is threatened by a sharp decline in donations. Today, the fund stands at $3,218,788.60; last year on this date it had taken in $4,043,747.60. This year, the drive ends on Feb. 28. There is still time to help.
If the appeal does not pick up, the seven charities linked to the fund might have to reduce or even eliminate programs at a time when the recession has pushed the unemployment rate in New York City to 11 percent. With the budgets of social service agencies squeezed, people who need emergency grants to remain in their apartments might find that they have no place to turn.
And for children growing up in some of the city's bleakest neighborhoods, the decline might mean going to bed some nights with empty stomachs. For other boys and girls, it might mean life with less health care, clothes, or books and toys.
The drop in donations "will have a very definite effect," said Philip Coltoff, executive director of the Children's Aid Society, a Neediest Cases charity.
 
Already, Government Cuts
 "Since there have been government cuts and since we're barely holding our own in our fund-raising," he said, "we are not in the position to make up for what will have been lost from the fund. It will force us to consider what was the intolerable before: actually reducing the level of services to those who need us the most."
Dr. Megan E. McLaughlin, executive director of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, another Neediest Cases charity, said she feared that the decline might prevent some social-service agencies from even letting people know where they can find help.
"I just finished reading an annual report from an agency about the importance of giving information," she said. "We take information for granted, but when you're in a crisis, that's a major problem."
To be sure, some of the fund's benefactors increased their donations this year because they realized that with the recession, charities were facing tight budgets and increasing poverty. They gave whatever they could spare -- from $5 to $5,000. The New York Times pays the expenses of the Neediest Cases campaign, so all contributions are given directly to the seven charities.
 
'Suffering Is Overwhelming'
 Sidney Sutter of Manhattan sent $4,000. "We have contributed for years because we know how the support is needed," he wrote. "Due to the economy, we felt obligated to increase our contribution this year."
Even though he is retired and on a limited income, George Ginsberg of Springfield, N.J., doubled his donation to $6.
Lawrence and Patti Bauer of Short Hills, N.J., also increased their donation, sending $1,500. "In our letters to the fund, we have always noted that the needs of those less fortunate than we seem to grow inexorably from the year before," they wrote. "What was true then continues, unfortunately, this year. The number of people suffering is overwhelming."
Donations to the fund this year have been inspired by a host of people and events. Some contributors wanted to honor friends, relatives, co-workers or strangers who came to their aid. Others sent money to help victims of the fierce storm that swept through the New York area last month or in memory of Patrick Daly, the principal in Red Hook, Brooklyn, who was slain in the crossfire of a drug dispute.
 
Triplets and Troubles
 If contributions to the Neediest Cases Fund do not rebound, the charities might have to turn away people like Joane V.
In 1991, Joane had just given birth to triplets -- two boys and a girl -- when her doctors told her that she had a degenerative muscular disease. Then she found out that the two boys had cerebral palsy and that the girl's mental development was lagging.
She had to quit her job as an administrator because of her illness, which left her tired constantly, and was soon forced to raise the children on her own after she separated from their father. She could not cope with chores like washing diapers, and sometimes she became so exhausted that she could not pick up the babies.
"The first six months were terrible," said Joane, 28, who lives in Coney Island. "I had no help whatsoever. It's overwhelming to anyone with one child, but with three children, it's impossible."
The Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, a Neediest Cases charity, provided her with a homemaker five days a week to care for the babies and help with cooking and cleaning.
"Without the homemaker, nothing would get done," she said. "My chores for myself wouldn't get done. Now it's a lot easier. It was hard at first to accept help, but it's made a big difference."
 
Tragedies on the Doorstep
 Such assistance reflects the primary mission of the Neediest Cases Fund: helping people get back on their feet. The Brooklyn Bureau sends nearly 150 homemakers to families across the borough who are in danger of collapse because of physical, medical and emotional crises.
"Many times without the homemaker service, children would end up in the foster care system," said Gem D. Wiltshire, a senior administrator at the Brooklyn Bureau. "This service helps to keep families intact and it's a more cost-efficient intervention than foster care service."
Mr. Coltoff of Children's Aid Society said he realized that many people felt overwhelmed by the growing number of disasters that have prompted calls for donations: the hurricanes in the United States, the famine in Somalia, the war in the Balkans.
But he added that Americans should not overlook the tragedies on their own doorsteps.
"I know it's hard -- that people's pockets are only so deep, even for New Yorkers, the most generous people in the world," he said. "But we're saying to people: Let's not forget the poor around us, who may be a little bit more invisible than some of the things that we see on television about problems abroad."

HEADLINE: A Pattern of Increasing Student Segregation

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 8

 BODY:
The state of Connecticut, at the urging of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., is about to confront one of the most divisive issues in American life, school integration. How long delayed the debate has been, and how segregated the state's schools have become, is suggested by a single set of numbers.
Black children are more likely to attend predominantly white schools in Virginia, Georgia, Louisiana and Alabama, where they make up more than 30 percent of the enrollment, than in Connecticut, where they are less than 15 percent. 
 Nearly 40 years after the United States Supreme Court declared that "in the field of public education, 'separate but equal' has no place," the nation's most segregated schools are found not in the South, but in Northern industrial states like Connecticut.
 
'The Level of Total Separation'
 "The level of total separation that had been seen as the essence of the Southern racial system is now much more characteristic of Illinois, Michigan and New York than of any state in the Deep South," Gary Orfield, a Harvard professor of education and social policy, wrote in a 1992 report on segregation for the National School Boards Association.
But if the Legislature acts on Mr. Weicker's call to develop regional integration plans across the state, local officials and residents in the overwhelmingly white towns that surround Connecticut's cities will discover a world of racial and ethnic change that upends traditional black-and-white thinking about integration.
Declining birth rates among whites, combined with strong migration and high birth rates among other groups, make it inevitable that Connecticut will look different 10 or 20 years from now, regardless what is accomplished this year in Hartford.
 
Hispanic Enrollment Is Up
 For instance, while blacks are increasingly segregated in urban schools, Hispanic children are even more segregated and increasing more rapidly, following a nationwide trend.
Already Hispanic students, mainly Puerto Rican, outnumber blacks in three of the state's five largest cities: Hartford, Bridgeport and Waterbury. In New Britain, the seventh-largest city, they outnumber blacks by nearly 3 to 1.
And while the percentage of minority students in the state increased to 25.7 percent in 1991, from 18.7 percent in 1981, Hispanic students grew to 10.4 percent, from 6.3 percent, gaining on blacks, who grew to 12.8 percent, from 11.1 percent.
One reason that minorities make up a larger part of the state's enrollment is that the number of white students declined after the postwar baby boom, falling by a third between 1976 and 1991. The increase in minority students -- 27,517 -- was one-sixth of the decline in whites -- 179,892.
 
Two Large Groups
 Still, according to the State Department of Education, more than half of the state's 169 school districts had fewer than 5 percent minority students in 1991, and the vast majority fewer than 10 percent. As those communities take part in integration plans, they will have to address the needs of two large minority groups, one of which, Hispanic residents, has greatly different needs from the traditional focus of desegregation, blacks.
In Hartford, where lawyers representing 19 city and suburban children are suing to integrate the city's schools with those of 21 surrounding towns, Puerto Rican children are poorer than blacks, have higher dropout rates and need special language instruction. More than half live in homes where English is not spoken.
Mr. Orfield, who is scheduled to testify for the plaintiffs in the Hartford desegregation case, Sheff v. O'Neill, has suggested that the nation may have to devise a new definition of desegregation as not only Hispanic residents, but also Asians, increase from New York to California.
He suggested that groups that have suffered discrimination, remain segregated, and have inferior schools -- like blacks, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and American Indians -- could benefit by integration not only with whites, but also with Asians and Hispanic students of higher socioeconomic backgrounds.
 
Economic Factors Too
 A key element in the Hartford lawsuit, Mr. Orfield said in an interview, is that it is focusing on not only racial, but also economic, segregation in Hartford's schools, where nearly two-thirds of the students live below the poverty line.
"This isn't just about race, it's about race and poverty," he said. "I think it's been a long time getting those issues together, and it describes the reality much better."
Governor Weicker, in his proposal to the General Assembly this week, acknowledged the link between racial and economic segregation. He also agreed with the Hartford plaintiffs in proposing regional integration plans. Such plans, covering dozens of communities, would serve to prevent a new round of segregation that could occur if, for example, only Hartford's inner ring of suburbs was included in a desegregation plan for the city.
Mr. Weicker has received praise in Connecticut for declaring the need to address the racial and economic divisions between cities and suburbs. "This is not something you do for political gain," said Ronald Ellis, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund who is working with the Sheff plaintiffs.
 
Rare Outside the South
 But the kind of city-suburban plans he has outlined are rare outside the South, because Federal courts have refused to order plans that cross city lines unless intentional segregation can be proved, and virtually all desegregation plans have been developed under pressure from a judge.
Mr. Weicker is proposing a framework that would allow towns to preserve local control over schools, mixing city and suburban students voluntarily by offering parents a variety of ways to send their children beyond their own neighborhoods.
That a governor has appealed for school integration is not remarkable, said Gordon Foster, director of the Southeastern Desegregation Center, a federally financed institute in Miami, because the record of Northern states is to "talk a lot and make nice policies" when it comes to integration.
"Connecticut's been screwing around with this for a long time," Mr. Foster said. "Unless a state either puts some teeth in it, or makes the financial incentives great enough, they're not going to get far enough."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL NOTEBOOK;
No Lockout? No Strike? No Way to Really Tell Until the Labor Talks Begin

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
In 1981, the owners' chief labor negotiator, Ray Grebey, assured his employers that the players wouldn't strike. When they did, Grebey assured the owners that once they missed their first pay check, the players would return to work. Fifty days later, the owners ended the strike when their strike insurance ran out.
The moral of the story: Don't believe everything that is said or thought in baseball labor negotiations.
The story and the moral are relevant now because the latest negotiations between the owners and the players are scheduled to begin Wednesday. The first meeting between Richard Ravitch, the owners' latest labor executive, and Donald Fehr, the players' veteran union leader, will not produce any dramatic developments. 
 Ravitch will not enter the meeting with proposal in hand. He will discuss philosophy and economics, explaining why baseball's system of player compensation must change (all the while hoping Fehr forgets that the Detroit Tigers just gave Cecil Fielder a $10 million signing bonus amid a myriad of related cases of management largesse).
The proposal to give the players a percentage of the clubs' revenue and turn that into a cap on players' salaries will come later. More critical for the moment are the two prevailing thoughts entering the talks:
1. The owners will not lock out the players, as they have done three previous times, most recently during the last negotiations three years ago.
2. The players will not strike, as they have done four times, most recently in 1985, because they are making too much money.
The players should not believe the first thought; the owners should not believe the second.
The players, in fact, do not believe the first thought; the owners, unfortunately, do believe the second.
 
Bad Public Image?
 Some segment of ownership even appears to be confused about the players' right to strike. One owner expressed the view the other day that not only didn't he think the players would strike -- they would look bad in the eyes of the public, he said -- but he also didn't think they could strike because there is a contract that doesn't expire until the end of this year.
Under terms of the collective bargaining agreement, however, with the owners reopening it today on matters of free agency, salary arbitration and minimum salary, either side is free to engage in "concerted action," that is, a lockout or a strike.
Ravitch acknowledged that there might be confusion on that provision of the agreement and he would make sure to explain it again at the owners' meeting in Texas on Tuesday. But given the rights they have, Ravitch himself believes the players are not prepared to do anything that would cost them the millions of dollars they earn in salary.
Henry Aaron, the Brookings Institution economist who served on baseball's economic study committee, quoted Ravitch on the subject of the upcoming talks.
 
Backing Good Leadership
 "He said he thought the players as a group would have exceeding difficulty walking away from their total salaries from missing a whole season and it was likely they would agree," Aaron said. "Don Fehr, on the other hand, believes this is a most unfortunate view if held by a significant number of owners because he is persuaded that the players as a group are quite willing to stick behind good leadership and do what needs to be done."
Ravitch said he did not recall making that comment to Aaron directly. "I only remember one discussion at the study committee," he said, "where I made the point that it was neither in the interest of the owners or the players not to play baseball. That's the same thing I've said publicly. I can't understand why rational people can't reach agreement."
As for the owners and a possible lockout, they themselves say there will be no lockout because 21 of 28 owners would have to approve it and 13 voted against reopening the agreement. Others, even some on the players' side, hold that view, too.
"They'd have to be insane to lock out," one player agent said. "They have two expansion teams starting play, they're in the last year of their big television contract, the public would kill them."
Union people, however, feel anyone who believes the owners won't lock out the players are naive. If they weren't prepared to lock out, they say, why would they reopen? They have reopened, Ravitch says, because it is the only way they can get a new agreement that would have an impact on the 1994 season.
But they didn't have to reopen to negotiate a new agreement that would take effect next year, the union thinking goes. They could have simply begun talks early enough, even now, to work out an agreement that would take effect next Jan.1.
There are two other views on a potential lockout, both of which have to be considered seriously:
1. Forget the apparent obstacle of the three-fourths vote Ravitch and the hard-line owners would have to overcome to get approval for a lockout. For one thing, one player agent said, the three-fourths vote could revert to a simple majority by a simple-majority vote.
For another, if Ravitch were to tell the owners at a mid-February meeting that the players have been intransigent and flatly refuse to accept their new salary-cap system and that by not locking out, the owners would be passing the bargaining leverage to the players, who could strike at some point (forgetting the current popular belief), he could -- with the aid of his allies -- get the necessary votes.
2. This one is an even more intriguing scenario.
A stipulation in the reopener provision states, "There shall be no change in any terms or conditions of employment prior to such concerted action" -- lockout or strike -- "and prior to a bona fide impasse in negotiations."
Labor law permits an employer to impose new terms and conditions unilaterally if the two sides have reached a legal impasse in negotiations, but this agreement has added an extra step, a work stoppage.
By locking out the players at some point this year, in spring training or later, the owners would have achieved the first step. Then they could continue negotiating and, failing to reach agreement, impose new terms consistent with their last offer.
Salary arbitration would disappear, who knows what would happen with free agency and a salary cap would be instituted.
 
Time Enough to Play
 A lockout wouldn't have to last forever. It could begin at the start of spring training and be ended by mid-March, leaving the players enough time, as in 1990, to prepare for the season. The executive council could order camps opened, saying the clubs didn't want to deprive the fans of the season.
In that event, the owners would put themselves in position to incur a strike, just as they would if they hadn't locked out. The players have struck at different times in their work-stoppage history, and this time they could listen to Ravitch. They could earn all of their millions, then strike just before the playoffs begin.
The bulk of the $401 million in 1993 television revenue comes from post-season games.
Of course, all work stoppages or threats could be avoided if both sides agreed to a no-action pledge. A member of management floated the idea with the union -- and the union very likely would go along with it -- but nothing came of it.
 
One Guest Uninvited
 The Rev. Jesse Jackson will speak to the major league club owners at their meeting in Texas on Tuesday, but Sharon Jones will not.
Jones, the former Oakland Athletics employee who has accused Marge Schott, the Cincinnati Reds' owner, of making racist comments, had been scheduled to speak after Jackson, but yesterday she said that she had been uninvited.
Jones said that Bill White, the National League president, called and told her that Schott's lawyer, Robert Bennett, had "raised a question of the propriety of a witness involved in the case speaking to the owners before a resolution of the case."
Jones said White told her she would be invited to speak at an owners meeting tentatively scheduled for Feb. 3. Presumably, the executive council will have acted in the Schott matter by then.
In 1987, when club owners were waiting for Peter Ueberroth, then commissioner, to begin a telephone conference call in 1987, Jones has said, Schott spoke disparagingly of blacks, saying, "I'd rather have a trained monkey working for me than a nigger."
Jones has been interviewed by members of the committee investigating the alleged comments of the Reds' owner, but she said White told her recently that "none of the owners came forward and said they remembered the call."
"I took that to mean 25 people didn't remember the call," she said. "I'll invite them to do the right thing and come forward. I want to let them know I was uncomfortable on the call and I knew they were, too. We have to get beyond the discomfort."
Noting that baseball is called the national pastime, Jones added, "It is past time that we do something about racial issues in sports."

No Fish Story: Many Boats Available

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD

 BODY:
Penny Berryman of Dardanelle, Ark., a world-class bass fishing champion, spends 300 days a year with rod and reel in hand. She caught her biggest fish, a bass nearly 15 pounds, during a pre-tournament practice session in Florida.
Berryman threw the fish back in the water in hopes of luring it again during the coming tournament. But she never saw the potential prize bass again. 
 "From that day on, I took a camera with me while fishing," Berryman said about the catch.
It is that kind of story that lays the foundation for Berryman's fishing seminar, at the New York National Boat Show, which began yesterday and runs through next Sunday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on 11th Avenue between 34th and 39th Streets.
And it is an indication of the continuing blues in the boating marketplace that a fish story is sharing showtime at a marine trade exhibition. Marine manufacturers, still trying to drag themselves out of a four-year economic slump, are counting on the fishing segment of boating to help bail the industry out.
Organizers have lined up several experts like Berryman, plus a wide array of fishing boats and electronics, fishing gear and accessories for the show.
 
An Inexpensive Sport
 "There's one thing in a recession," said Kevin VanDam of Kalamazoo, Mich., the 1992 bass angler of the year. "Fishermen, they don't give up fishing. It's a sport that doesn't cost that much. I fished a lot of years from the side of a bank before I got a small aluminum boat."
VanDam, who now fishes from a $20,000 sport-fishing craft, also plans to speak at a seminar at the boat show. Although his boat is a top-of-the-line model with a 150 horsepower engine, VanDam says that a suitable package of boat and motor can be found for less than $5,000.
It is small-boat sales that have given the industry a shot of optimism lately. Sales of relatively inexpensive canoes, small jet-powered boats and inflatables were up in 1992 while sales in the marine industry overall declined by 2 percent from 1991, according to estimates of the National Marine Manufacturers Association, boating's national trade organization.
Mike Waninger, senior vice president of the Yamaha Marine Group, a division of Yamaha Motor Corporation, U.S.A, said recently that the jet-powered water vehicles market has grown by 500 percent, to $500 million in sales, in the last five years. Yamaha is one of several companies that manufacture the solo and two-person boats, which look and ride like waterbound motorcycles and cost about $5,000.
 
Jet Power Is In
 Numerous companies will be displaying jet-powered personal craft at the show, as well as new jet-powered runabouts that carry four people and cost about $13,000. Models being shown include the 13.5-foot Rage by Boston Whaler, the 14-foot Jazz by Bayliner, and the 13.5-foot Sea Rayder by Sea Ray. Another company, Zodiac, will show its new Pro Jet, a 14-foot semi-rigid inflatable jet boat.
While small boats will be predominant, the New York show also plans on big-boat displays. The largest vessel will be Bluewater Marine's new 62-foot motor yacht, which will sell for about $700,000 fully equipped. While there are more than nine times more powerboats than sailboats at the show, manufacturers of both craft plan to show new 1993 models.
Among the sailboat companies with boats on display will be Hunter Marine, Beneteau, American Sail and Island Packet, a firm that will show its new 35-foot cruising catamaran.
 
Hundreds of Boats on Display
 Powerboat companies will have hundreds of boats on display, including models by Blackfin, Trojan, Four Winns, Mako, Baja, and Chris-Craft. The 46 RacerX, a speed boat by Cigarette, is propelled by three 1,000 horsepower engines, and is capable of speeds exceeding 100 miles an hour.
Boats designed with family cruising in mind include a new model from Wellcraft, the 243 Prima. A 24-foot power cruiser, suitable for four people, the boat comes with a full galley for cooking, a queen-sized main berth, and additional berths midship.
Electronics continue to dominate the marine industry as sophisticated equipment becomes increasingly miniaturized and affordable. The New York show will display the latest in Global Postioning Systems, electronic hand-held units that use satellite readings for navigation. The newest in sonar and radar units are also being exhibited.
For information on boat show times and seminars, telephone organizers at (212) 216-3616.

HEADLINE: Why Not Pay Equity for All Women?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The women's economic agenda described in "Economics as if Women Mattered" (Dec. 13) doesn't go far enough. We believe in equal pay for work of equal value for all employees, not just government employees. 
 Take a look beyond our northern border -- almost 800 United States corporations with offices in Ontario live under the terms of Ontario pay equity legislation. How can their employees' paychecks be closer to parity in Canada than here?
In the United States, in spite of the 30-year-old equal pay act, the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows men making more money than women in almost every job category. Even where women dominate a job -- such as registered nurse or secretary -- the average pay for males is higher than for females.
Within the rising pool of temporary, part-time and contingent workers, a predominantly female and people-of-color work force, you will find the problems of unequal pay, uneven health care and virtually no pension benefits.
Serious attention to enforcing current laws, learning from what has worked elsewhere, and creating greater opportunity to be heard without fear of reprisal could go a long way to achieving fair pay.

Susan Bianchi-Sand is executive director of the National Committee on Pay Equity.

Not A Movie

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
It was a free ride for the headline writers. Take one sure-fire human interest story of parental abandonment and one hit movie, and the words almost wrote themselves: Home Alone.
Overnight David and Sharon Schoo, who went to Acapulco and allegedly left their two little girls to fend for themselves, were billed as "the most hated couple in America." When they were arrested at the airport and led away in handcuffs, one bystander hissed "Scrooge!" And across America parents asked aloud: How could anyone leave a 9-year-old and a 4-year-old by themselves and go off on vacation like that? 
 But there were other voices, too, and they are the ones that bear hearing. A delivery man called a radio station in Pennsylvania to say he habitually delivered packages to households in which small children were home by themselves.
Police in Texas discovered an 8-year-old in a hotel room on Christmas Day. He had apparently been left there for two days by his father, alone with a jar of peanut butter, a loaf of bread and a box of cereal.
And a teacher in New York City reported that she once taught sisters whose mother worked a night shift and who, she suspected, were left alone all night long, locked in the apartment for their own well-being. She said she believed there were many such stories in her school. "These are not bad mothers," she said. "They're trying to support their kids."
Whatever the reason, America is a country in which, child welfare advocates have been warning for years, many children are home alone. It may not be for nine days, which is how long the Schoos were gone. But it might be every afternoon from 3 P.M. to nightfall. The estimates on kids who come home from school to an empty house vary widely, but all are in the millions.
What we do know is that childhood has changed since many of us were children. Ten years ago Marie Winn, in "Children Without Childhood," posited the end of an Age of Protection and the beginning of the Age of Preparation. "The new era," she wrote, "operates on the belief that children must be exposed early to adult experience in order to survive in an increasingly complex and uncontrollable world."
As parents are home less and children know more -- about sex, about drugs, about how to run the microwave -- the lines between child and adult blur. It even shows in our clothes; once mothers wore hose and heels and their little girls wore anklets and Mary Janes. Today it is different: 4-year-olds, 14-year-olds, 40-year-olds -- the Gap dresses us all alike.
In this atmosphere treating kids as quasi-adults becomes easier earlier. And it makes life easier for working parents; we are naturally more comfortable, at our desks, on the night shift, with the idea of the competent child rather than the dependent and vulnerable one.
When we think of the dangers of children home alone, we think of the physical: the fires, the accidents. But what stays with me from the Schoo episode is what the elder girl said afterward, when she and her sister had run next-door after a smoke alarm went off. She said that she had been lonely.
People were shocked that such a thing could have happened in a prosperous neighborhood. But in her book on America's children, "When the Bough Breaks," the economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett cited a California study of 5,000 eighth graders that concluded it was the affluent children who spent the largest amount of time on their own, apparently because their parents' careers were so time-consuming.
The traditional school schedule is not set up for today's world; more after-school and summer programs would provide at least a safe haven for many children. Nor are traditional work schedules conducive to family life; more flexible arrangements are needed for both mothers and fathers.
But ultimately the issue of how we treat our children is more complex than matters of education and economics. It goes to the question of how much childhood we are willing -- and able -- to allow them. We should not confuse the toughness and savvy we impose out of our own need and fear with real maturity. What the Schoos are accused of doing is an aberration and an outrage, but they did it in an atmosphere that openly treats young children as quasi-adults. Perhaps, more often than any of us realize, many of America's kids are home alone -- and lonely.

THE ECONOMY
 
A Little Leftover Untidiness From President Bush 

As President Bush scurries around trying to leave the White House policy agenda as tidy as possible for the next occupant -- he concluded an arms agreement with Russia and is nearing a possible trade agreement with the rest of the world -- one unsightly blemish remains from his Administration: the Federal deficit. The latest figures, released last week, put it at $290.2 billion for 1992, a record. That was less than the White House had originally projected, but its new forecasts were really scary -- a deficit of $292.4 billion in 1994, rising to $305 billion in 1997. What is even worse, unpublished reports from the Office of Management and Budget say the deficit could grow to $400 billion by 1997 if current programs simply keep pace with inflation. So much red ink -- interest payments alone were $199 billion last year on the nation's $3 trillion debt -- will make it more difficult for President-elect Bill Clinton to embark on aggressive spending plans to reanimate the economy. The "math does not work," said the White House budget director, Richard Darman.

Finally, a Season to Celebrate
 
The nation's beleaguered sales clerks and package wrappers -- not to mention its Santas -- knew it was a better shopping season than any recent Christmas past. Last week the statistics confirmed their hunches. Christmas 1992 was the best since 1988 -- the last of the go-go years. December sales at Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's No. 1 retailer, were up 27 percent from last year; the Kmart Corporation said sales rose 9.1 percent for the season. Other department stores prospered as well. December sales "ran ahead of expectations in virtually all areas of our business," said Allen Questrom, chairman of Federated Department Stores Inc.

The Jobless Rate Sticks
 
Most economists, seeing the upturn in the economy, expected to see some improvement in the unemployment rate. Instead, according to the Labor Department, unemployment held steady in December at 7.3 percent, the same as the month before. Though a wash is better than a loss, the signfiicance of the figures is open to interpretation. "The labor force actually contracted in the fourth quarter from the third quarter," said Charles McMillion, president of MBG Information Services in Washington. "That's why unemployment has not risen even though so few jobs have been created."

Reich Replays His Theme
 
When Labor Secretary-designate Robert B. Reich, a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School, addressed Congress last week during his confirmation hearings, he reiterated themes he had been developing for years. He talked about pushing companies to spend more on job training and job safety and to invest in other measures to spur competitiveness. An investment "strategy is needed not only to create more jobs, but better jobs," Mr. Reich told a Senate committee. But one proposal from the campaign was absent from Mr. Reich's up-with-business remarks: Bill Clinton's proposal to require major companies to spend 1.5 percent of their payroll on training. "I am not yet sure of the best combination of carrots, sticks, and educational outreach," Mr. Reich said.

Milken, Halfway to Freedom
 
After serving 22 months in a minimum security prison, Michael R. Milken, the financier who virtually invented the junk-bond market, was moved to a halfway house in Hollywood. Mr. Milken's final release will be on March 2, when he will begin community work. Mr. Milken has paid $1.1 billion in fines and settlements, but is still believe to have substantial wealth.

Construction on a Roll
 
At last a little lift in the construction sector. According to the Commerce Department, spending on new construction rose 2.1 percent in November to $441.8 billion from $432.8 billion in October. November's rise was the third monthly increase in a row. But while residential outlays grew by a solid 1.4 percent in the month as prospective home owners took advantage of low mortgage rates, spending on the over-built apartment sector fell by 4.8 percent. "I would expect the residential numbers will continue to climb modestly as the housing market continues to strengthen," said David Berson, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage Association. Mr. Berson was not so optimistic about commercial real estate because of the "high vacancy rates."

 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Boeing Is Talking to . . .
 
Which European company will be joining the Boeing Company to build the next-generation jumbo jet? It depends on whom you ask. Last week, John Hayhurst, a vice president at Boeing, said it would soon sign an agreement with Deutsche Aerospace A.G., a unit of Daimler Benz, to determine the feasibility of building a 550- to 800-passenger airliner. Deutsche Aerospace holds a 38 percent stake in Airbus Industrie, Boeing's arch rival in the skies. Airbus is also examining the feasibility of building a super-jumbo jet and some analysts wonder if Boeing's decision to work with Deutsche Aerospace might be part of an effort to draw an important company away from the Airbus project. But according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, British Aerospace P.L.C., which has a 20 percent stake in Airbus, is also talking with Boeing. But that's not all. At a news conference, Airbus said it was considering working with Boeing on a super-jumbo jet. Mr. Hayhurst would confirm only that talks with Deutsche Aerospace were under way.

Pushing Through a Tariff Deal
 
In the diplomatic equivalent of a blitz, the Bush Administration has been trying to cobble together an agreement by the end of this week for a comprehensive reduction in tariffs. The deal would cover a wide range of goods from clothing to fine crystal. Negotiations began when Carla A. Hills, the United States Trade Representative, made a quiet visit to London. She met there with Sir Leon Brittan, the British politician, and senior European officials. If a deal can be hatched, it would be brought to Geneva on Friday for the meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. To add to the urgency of the deal, Mrs. Hills has been reminding the Europeans that the free-trading Bush Administration is still legally in charge -- but not for long.

A Get-Together a la Reagan
 
When he was still President-elect, Ronald Reagan had a tete-a-tete along the Texas border with Mexico's then President, Jose Lopez Portillo. Last week, President-elect Bill Clinton carried on the tradition by meeting with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in Austin at the Texas Governor's mansion. Though the meeting was not designed as a negotiating session, the North American Free Trade Agreement was on the agenda. Mr. Clinton supports the agreement with the proviso that rules regarding the environment and labor be strengthened. "It's basically a get-acquainted session," said a Clinton spokesman, George Stephanopoulos.

 
 
COMPANIES

 
Next's Next Deal
 
When Steven P. Jobs founded Apple Computer in 1976, he was a revolutionary. Then he started Next Inc., with its Mac-on-steroids software and heavy-duty Motorola hardware. The world's computer mavens appreciated Next's futuristic workstations, but they didn't exactly beat a pathway to the stores. To really take off, Next needed an alliance with a large manufacturer, analysts said. Word leaked out last week that the Hewlett-Packard Company was talking to Next about licensing its innovative Nextstep software. Though the talks began with discussions about a broader relationship between the two companies that would have included hardware, insiders said a software deal would be it -- at least for now.

A Videophone White Sale
 
Love that clever videophone technology but hate the price? Has A.T.& T. got a deal for you. Last week A.T.& T. said it would chop the price of its Videophone 2500 by a third, to $1,000, and send a $500 rebate to anyone who already bought the phone. It takes two videophones, but no special wiring, to hold a televised conversation. But if that deal doesn't grab you, A.T.& T.'s rival, MCI, plans to sell a videophone for $750 with a discount of up to 10 percent for those buying two or more.
 
To the Root of Airline Problems
 
Even the nation's strongest carriers are feeling balance-sheet pain from the fare wars. To cut costs by $400 million a year, United Airlines announced a package of layoffs, fewer flights and other measures like pay cuts for top executives. But United's chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, said its problems were those of the industry and called upon President-elect Clinton to appoint a national commission to study the airline business.

Bragging Rights for Taurus
 
After slugging it out for more than a year, it's official: The best-selling car in America is a domestic make. According to figures released last week, the Ford Motor Company's Taurus finally surpassed the Honda Accord as the nation's No. 1 selling car. Ford and Honda were neck and neck in the sales race going into December. But then Ford began offering cut-rate leases and marked-down sticker prices. It also offered large rebates to retail customers -- as high as $1,750 -- and rebates to car-rental companies. That pushed the Taurus over the top. For 1992, 409,751 Tauruses were sold compared with 393,447 Accords. Why go to all that effort -- not to mention expense? "We know that being able to say you are No. 1 makes a difference in the minds of many consumers," said Phil Novell, Ford's general sales manager.

Honda Heads for the Indy

Back in the old days, race cars zipped around the brick yard at Indianapolis powered by big American four-cylinder Offenhauser engines. Then came the svelte Europeans, led by Lotus, with 12 slim cylinders and lots of torque. Last week, Honda said it would begin building its own Indy engine, a big 6.5-liter V-8 model. "Challenges have always been important to the growth and success of Honda," said Thomas G. Elliot, executive vice president of the America Honda Motor Company.

The Airport Builder
 
It was quite a win for Bechtel Civil Inc. The big San Francisco-based construction and engineering company was awarded a $2 billion, 10-year contract to redevelop and expand the Miami International Airport and five neighboring aviation facilities.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 31, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Business Diary column on Jan. 10, about the Honda Motor Company's plans to build a V-8 engine for the Indianapolis 500, misstated the engine's capacity. Its displacement is 2.65 liters, not 6.5.

 BODY:
RECESSION has taken a high toll among travel agencies. Many have merged or closed their doors. Yet the worst may be over, according to an assessment of current activities in the industry.
"Clients are very budget conscious and searching for bargains," said Alberta D'Aloia Wort, owner of the Yonkers Travel Bureau. "Still, many say a winter vacation has become a necessity, more important to them than one in the summer. We have just come off the best holiday season we've had in the past three years. And the most popular destination was Disney World." 
 Mrs. Wort, who has headed Yonkers Travel for 34 years, grew up in the industry. The company began as the Yonkers Steamship Bureau in 1920. "It was started by my father and uncle," she said. "Their original customers were Italian immigrants who were members of families being reunited in the United States."
Norman Sherman, a travel consultant who is vice president of the Hudson Valley chapter of the American Society of Travel Agents, and a principal in the Suburban Travel Center in Larchmont, said he sees signs that this year will be a better year for travel agencies.
 
A Turnaround in Sight
 "And just in time, too," Mr. Sherman said. "In the 38 years I have been in business, last year, 1992, was the worst year I have ever seen. In ASTA's Hudson Valley Chapter, which includes Westchester, Rockland, Putnam and Sullivan Counties, about 50 or 60 travel agencies either merged or went out of business. Nationwide that figure was 5,000."
In commenting on signs of a turnaround, Mr. Sherman said, "Although most people are still extremely budget conscious and looking for the best travel buy, they are shopping for travel earlier, which is good. The Caribbean is coming back, and Disney World as a destination is very strong. And the best value of all can be found in the cruise market because there are so many new ships operating. There is an excess of cruise capacity, and discounts abound."
 
An Extremely Competitive Industry
 Through the years, Mrs. Wort's company widened its base to serve a more diversified clientele. "We sur ved wars, terrorists and volatile air fares because we've always been quick to adapt to the market," Mrs. Wort said. "We're generalists, not specialists, and we are currently serving three generations of clients. For some, we book African safaris; for others, Amtrak trips."
Mrs. Wort said, however, that the travel industry is extremely competitive.
"In order to stay in business you not only have to give clients a lot of personal service, but you have to be imaginative in opening new markets," she said. "I think it's interesting that one new market we've developed has its roots in the earliest days of the company." It is, she said, the business of booking family reunions, in which people from different parts of the country get together at a resort or on a dude ranch or on a cruise ship for a family celebration. Family reunions also stimulate repeat business, she added.
"Recently we arranged a dude ranch stay for a couple celebrating their 45th wedding anniversary," she said. "The family and members attending ranged in age from a 3-year-old grandchild to the anniversary couple in their 60's, and all of them reported that they had a terrific time."
Equally successful, she said, are packages for couples embarking on second marriages.
"Many couples getting married for the second time are glad to dispense with the traditional ceremony and reception in favor of a wedding trip to an exotic setting," she said. "They're usually accompanied by some friends and family, and all of them will go to Hawaii or St. Thomas for the wedding and a vacation. New types of honeymoons have become very big, and they aren't necessarily expensive. For instance, we just sent eight people in a wedding party to Hawaii on a $500 package per person, which included everything."
Although word-of-mouth recommendations generate considerable business, Mrs. Wort said, she still aggressively pursues new clients. "I feel it's important to use everything at your disposal to keep the business growing," she said. "For instance, we have a toll-free line to make it easy for customers who have moved out of the area to book with us, and I frequently speak to groups about travel, and that stimulates business. I'm also very visible in the community through my activities with civic groups." Her tactics have paid off, she said. "Our fiscal year ends in March, and so far we have been running 10 percent ahead of our best year."
 
A New Mass Market
 What he calls a new mass market is also a reason for optimism, Mr. Sherman said.
"We're beginning to get a lot of younger clients," he said. "The baby-boom generation is coming into its own. They're people who have been around. They're repeat travelers. For them, travel means more than a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Europe, which is what it might have meant to their parents. They value travel and allot a higher percent of their disposable income to it. And while I find they're not necessarily looking for bargains, they are looking for the best value. Value is the key to that market."
Susan Kantor agrees. Mrs. Kantor, a veteran of 40 years in the travel industry, is owner of Noto Travel Service in New Rochelle.
"Our clients, even those taking expensive trips, are more conscious of value than ever," she said. "And, for instance, although Europe is expensive, we have been successfully selling an all-inclusive $600 seven-day package to London. And that's value."
Because of the number of new ships, cruises are the biggest bargain of the season, Mrs. Kantor said, but she added that cruises are not for everyone. "I tell clients, once you're on a ship, you're stuck, you're a captive audience," she said.
 
An Emphasis on Service
 "Ours is a service business and a big part of it is giving clients good advice," she added. "For instance, Cancun is a good value; it's inexpensive now. And there is also great interest in Costa Rica. The Caribbean is expensive, and many people find it boring. The important element in the travel business, I'm stressing, is to help the client make the right decisions."
It is by stressing service, Mrs. Kantor said, that her agency has weathered the recession. "Repeat business and word-of-mouth advertising are the life blood of every travel agency," she said. "However, I'm encouraged by the number of new companies that have moved near our office on Main Street that have been giving us walk-in business. I feel that we will have a good year."
The strongest agencies have been service-oriented agencies, said Mildred Stoker, president of the Alliance of Westchester Travel Agencies, a trade group with more than 100 members in Westchester and Rockland Counties.
"They are the ones who managed to keep their volume high during 1992, which was a most difficult year," Mrs. Stoker said.
As the owner of Stoker Travel in New City, Mrs. Stoker said that at her agency family vacations and winter travel were stronger this year than last.
"We are also doing more group travel, special interest travel and incentive travel," she said.

HEADLINE: At 50, Rights Panel Catches Up to Itself

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
THOUGH almost a century after his death Frederick Douglass's vision for an end to racial injustice still eludes the world, to celebrate the anniversary of the oldest racial relations agency in the United States, the words of Mr. Douglass will be brought to Connecticut.
"Presenting Mr. Frederick Douglass: From Slave to Statesman," a one-person show by the actor Frederick Morsell, will be performed at 8 P.M. on Saturday at the Lincoln Theater at the University of Hartford, to begin the 50th-anniversary celebration of the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities. 
 Patricia J. Jackson, education and outreach representative for the commission, said there would be several events through the year to commemorate the anniversary, including an awards banquet in June to honor people who have actively worked on civil rights issues over the years, and an international human rights day to close the year in December.
On Jan. 18, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, there will be a bell-ringing ceremony at the Capitol in Hartford, where a replica of the Liberty Bell will be rung in a ceremony from 11 A.M. to noon that the commission will sponsor with the Martin Luther King holiday commission.
Founded in 1943 as the result of an attack on two men on their way to a convention in Memphis, the Connecticut commission predated by more than 20 years the civil rights groups in most other states. Today, the commission investigates about 3,000 allegations of discrimination each year, 90 percent or more involving job discrimination based on age, race, sex or religion.
"Not every state has a commission like this, even today," Ms. Jackson said. "We are fortunate here in Connecticut to have an agency that's been established for so long, and that has the enforcement powers that it has."
 
Progess Noted
 Carroll E. Brown, first vice president of the Connecticut branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which is co-sponsoring "Presenting Mr. Frederick Douglass," said the N.A.A.C.P. appreciated the progress toward racial justice that had been possible in Connecticut because of the commission's work.
"The commission is very effective at letting people know that discrimination is not going to be tolerated, in any form," Ms. Brown said.
Louis Martin, the director of the commission, said the civil rights agency was founded to improve relations between white people and minority groups, but has expanded considerably, becoming the office that enforces civil rights laws for women, people with disabilities, and others.
"The commission has done an outstanding job in its first 50 years," Mr. Martin said. "We've put in place the framework to guarantee people their basic civil rights, but what we need now is something that addresses civil attitudes.
 
50 Years Ago or Today
 "The people who did not have basic political or economic power 50 years ago are the same people who do not have political or economic power today," he said.
The commission was established in 1943 after Dr. John C. Jackson of the Union Baptist Church in Hartford, and the Rev. S. A. Young of Washington, D.C., were attacked on a train on their way to a national Baptist convention in Memphis. They were trying to go from a Pullman car for black people, to a day coach for black people, when they tried to pass through a day coach for white people only.
"There was considerable outrage in Connecticut over the attack, and one of the results was to establish an agency to address race relations in this state," Ms. Jackson said.
The Governor of Connecticut, Raymond E. Baldwin, set up what he called the Connecticut Interracial Commission to conciliate racial disputes, said James Jedrziewski, who has produced a videotape on the history of the commission that will be shown on local access channels on cable television networks around the state.
The commission's enforcement powers began in 1959 with the passage of what was known as the Big Stick bill, Mr. Jedrziewski said. That bill, which passed the legislature after several attempts, allowed the commission to impose injunctions and financial damages in civil rights cases.
"As the civil rights laws were expanded through the 1960's, the focus of the commission expanded," Mr. Jedrziewski said.
 
Promoting Housing
 Mr. Jedrziewski said it was interesting to see how the commission seemed ahead of its time. In the 1960's and 1970's, for instance, it promoted scattered-site public housing for low-income families, reasoning that the only way for people of different backgrounds to get along was for them to live together and get to know one another. But Federal regulations encouraged high-rise public housing complexes that in most cities have become minority ghettos.
"Today we're turning back to the approach the commission preferred many years ago," Mr. Jedrziewski said. "With few exceptions, the high-rises didn't work out at all."
The commission also adapted to changes in society, becoming one of the first to extend civil rights protection to people with AIDS.
"We always took the approach that people with AIDS were protected based on laws prohibiting discrimination against people with disabilities," Mr. Jedrziewski said.
 
Blatant Segregation of Past
 "We still have to get beyond the way people regard each other," he said, "but there has been a lot of progress. When you go back 50 years, as I did researching the video, it's quite surprising how blatantly, totally segregated some sections of society were."
Saturday's presentation should point out some of the progress that has been made. Mr. Douglass, who lived from 1818 to 1895, was a black American born into slavery who rose to lead the fight against it. He escaped his masters in 1838, taught himself to read and write, and became publisher of the Abolitionist newspaper "The North Star." He was later an advisor to Abraham Lincoln and a proponent of women's rights.
Mr. Morsell's portrayal of Mr. Douglass came about when a black clergyman from Los Angeles asked him in 1984 to develop programs that would give ghetto children hope. From that evolved the Frederick Douglass Foundation.
 
'Meaning of the Fourth'
 Mr. Morsell began performing as Frederick Douglass, and has recorded two albums in a series on the Abolitionist's greatest speeches: "The Meaning of the Fourth of July for the Negro," an anti-slavery speech delivered July 5, 1852, and "The Lesson of the Hour," delivered at the World's Fair in 1892 in Chicago. "The Lesson of the Hour" traces how, during Reconstruction, racism developed into attitudes and behavior that remain today.
Mr. Morsell likens the misery ofcities and their drug problems to the conditions of pre-Civil War slavery, and contends education today, as it was then, is the only way out.
Tickets to the event are $19, $15 for students and elderly people, with proceeds benefiting the Roy Wilkins Scholarship Fund of the N.A.A.C.P. and the Martin Luther King Jr. Youth Foundation.
Mr. Jedrziewski said that as the jurisdiction of the commission grew, it evolved. "By the 1970's our caseload had become our major focus; we had turned away from the education and outreach that the commission was founded to do."
Mr. Martin said it has become more and more difficult to keep up with the caseload, particularly given the state's budget problems. Over the last year the commission's staff has shrunk to 99 employees from 112. "Programs like civil rights enforcement and civil rights advocacy are seen as soft programs, and when the budget ax falls it falls on the soft programs first," Mr. Martin said. "I'm anticipating more cuts this year, which means we have to work smarter with the resources that we do have."
 
Few Outright Critics
 Though the program has few outright critics -- "I don't think anyone disagrees with the intent of anti-discrimination laws," said a Bridgeport lawyer who has represented defendants in discrimination cases, Robert B. Mitchell -- some companies which have come under the commission's scrutiny have reservations concerning its investigations. For instance, Mr. Mitchell proposed that if a one-armed homosexual man with AIDS were to file a discrimination complaint against a company the company might receive a request to disclose how many other one-armed homosexual men with AIDS were employed. Other than the physical handicap, he said, a company might not even know whether it had any other homosexuals, or people with AIDS, in its employ.
"You get these requests for tremendous volumes of information," Mr. Mitchell said. "If they would just let us explain what happened in a specific case, a lot of these cases could be a lot simpler."
In the last year or so Mr. Mitchell observed that the commission had sent more cases directly to Superior Court, rather than go through administrative hearings in an attempt to resolve differences. And he said he thought that some of the commission's duties could be assumed by Federal agencies with the same jurisdiction.
"I don't know if any of that translates into a desire to get rid of the commission, because we'd only need something to take its place," Mr. Mitchell said. "As long as society is, quite properly, focused on these kinds of issues, we're going to need something like the commission."
 
Strength and Timeliness
 Even the commission's strongest supporters agree that it could be stronger, particularly in terms of resolving cases in a more timely manner.
"No matter how effective" the commission, "people get frustrated when it takes six months or a year to get results, and it can take longer than that in some cases," Ms. Brown said.
In addition, she said, she would like to see the commission do more self-promotion, and open more regional offices; it now has offices in Waterbury, Bridgeport and Norwich. "They need to be located in every major city," Ms. Brown said. "People in New Haven should not have to drive to Waterbury or Hartford to get a problem solved."
But she said the commission's problems were rooted in its finances. "It's a question of staffing right now, they've got to have more people," Ms. Brown said. "I want to see the commission do more about educational desegregation, to end real estate 'steering,' and to end job discrimination. There are still minorities doing the same job as someone else and being paid less.
"But that takes staff, and more staff means spending more money," Ms. Brown acknowledged.
The commission's director, Mr. Martin, said that was one reason the commission's focus was changing from attacking discrimination case by case to the kind of educational programs that could change people's attitudes. His hope, he said, is to reduce the number of cases coming in, by educating people about the damage discrimination does.
"I think we need to continue to have a strong, vigorous enforcement policy, but what we've done the last 50 years is to say that law enforcement is the method that we're going to use to eliminate discrimination, and it hasn't worked," Mr. Martin said. "What we really need to do is alter the structure that creates the problem. If we don't do that, we're going to see the same problems 50 years from now."

HEADLINE: Businesses Join Hospitals to Curb Medical Costs

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
SQUEEZED by escalating health care costs and growing pressure from the business community to curb costly expansion programs, Connecticut's hospitals are embarking on a wave of cooperative ventures with one another and with the businesses that help pay their bills.
This new mood of cooperation comes after years of intense competition among hospitals across the state, each trying to offer new services and lure patients from the other, and after frequent clashes between hospital and business leaders over the need for rising hospital budgets and expensive building projects. 
 The reason for the thaw in relations, hospital and business officials say, is primarily a growing awareness that hospitals and businesses have more to gain financially by cooperating than by fighting. The result, they say, could be a more moderate climb in health care costs over the next few years.
At Danbury Hospital, for example, a program started to control the cost of employees out on injury leave has worked so well that it has been adopted by dozens of businesses.
 
Satellite Pharmacies for Employees
 "We started the program just to keep ourselves solvent," said James Gravius, vice president for workers' compensation services at Danbury Hospital. "But no one has anything to lose by working together, and you have everything to gain."
The parent company of Bridgeport Hospital has offered to set up satellite operations of its pharmaceutical department at area companies so their employees can get prescriptions without ever leaving the office.
"If we can get them to sign up all of their employees we can offer them a significant discount," said John K. Evans, the president of NovaMed Corp., a Bridgeport Hospital affiliate. "And we're using our pharmacy to its maximum efficiency."
Lawrence and Memorial Hospital in New London and William W. Backus Hospital in New London recently agreed to share a single laundry department, rather than each operating its own.
"The Backus laundry reached the end of its life, and it would have cost them $400,000 or more to put in a new one," said a spokesman for Lawrence and Memorial, Kelly A. Anthony. "We give them a better price for four million pounds of laundry a year than they'd get anywhere else.
"Any time we can avoid duplication of services, everybody saves money," Mr. Anthony said.
 
Clash Over Costs
 Hospitals and the business community clashed throughout the 1980's, arguing over whether hospital budgets and building projects were imperative or inflated. Spokesmen for businesses, which pay the bulk of health care costs through their insurance premiums, would show up at health care hearings and demand cutbacks, while hospitals would counter that they had cut back as far as they could. Among the hospitals, the competition was fierce, as each tried to steal business from others. Today that seems to be changing.
"We're starting to see more of these cooperative arrangements," said a member of the State Commission on Hospitals and Health Care, Donald C. Pogue. "But there's a lot of good work still to be done," he said. "There's a lot of potential for savings, while at the same time providing care for people, through cooperation."
Janet C. Spegele, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association -- a group that has bitterly fought hospital rate increases the last several years -- maintained that it was in the best interest of hospitals and businesses to work together in order to realize savings.
Ms. Spegele said one reason for the thaw in the relationship was that hospitals had become more realistic. From 1980 to 1990, there were double-digit increases in hospital rates, some years approaching 20 percent on average. The average increase in 1991 was 8.7 percent and in 1992, 7.6 percent.
Businesses are also taking more of an initiative, Ms. Spegele said. "Business people have served on hospital boards for years, as a civic duty," she said. "Now they've realized they shouldn't be just talking about things like how to raise money for a new wing, but things like how to get injured workers back to the job quickly and safely."
 
Finding Common Ground
 Health care officials have different ideas about why cooperation is suddenly more prevalent. Some say it is because after years of conflict, hospitals and businesses are finally recognizing the things they have in common.
Frank A. Corvino, president of Greenwich Hospital, said that when he was seeking regulatory approval for a $116 million renovation project, he had spent considerable time explaining to the business community how it could actually save money through steps like energy efficiency and better use of space.
"It's a big project, and we want to make sure people understood it," Mr. Corvino said. Businesses are not taking an active role in supporting the project, but they are not going to the hospital commission to oppose it, either.
With 1,100 employees, all covered by a health benefits package, Mr. Corvino said, it was easy to sympathize with the business community about the need for cost control.
"We're a business also, and our health care costs rise at least as fast as everyone else's," he said.
Joseph Coatsworth, vice president of the Connecticut Hospital Association, said another reason for the cooperation might be that the poor economy was forcing people to work together.
"There are a lot of discussions going on," Mr. Coatsworth acknowledged. "Maybe being in a recession is bringing it out."
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has vowed to make Connecticut more competitive in terms of attracting business, Mr. Coatsworth noted. "One result of that has been hospital interest in meeting with business on controlling costs, which is a major issue in terms of competitiveness," he said.
 
Workers' Compensation an Issue
 One of the first areas hospitals are focusing on is workers' compensation costs. Danbury Hospital and several other hospitals around the state are offering programs that teach employers how to reduce the risk of injury in the workplace through proper training, and how to get injured employees back on the job more quickly.
"You spend a couple of hundred dollars now, and you can avoid a slipped disk and thousands of dollars in compensation costs a few years down the road," Mr. Gravius said.
He said that four years ago Danbury was paying an extra $750,000 a year in workers' compensation insurance costs because of excessive injuries. The Danbury Hospital program has worked so well that the hospital has been brought in to consult at 22 other hospitals, including one in California.
The program was also offered to a couple of businesses on a pilot basis two years ago, including Marcus Dairy in Danbury, where the dairy's president, Michael L. Marcus, said it has helped bring runaway costs under control.
"Our workers' compensation costs haven't gone up, but our employee payroll has gone up, and the cost of medical care in general has gone up, during the last two years," Mr. Marcus said. "Just to say our costs haven't gone up means the program has been a tremendous success because, up to the point we joined, our workers' compensation costs had been skyrocketing.
"Both parties have to realize there's more to be gained by cooperating than there is by fighting over who's to blame for rising medical costs," Mr. Marcus concluded.
Marcus Dairy has a satellite operation in New Haven, where the company remains at odds with the local hospitals, and the health care costs have risen, Mr. Marcus said.
 
The Facades Come Down
 "What we're developing in Danbury is a high level of trust between us and the hospital, and us and our employees," he said.
Mr. Gravius said that over the last year, the program has been fully implemented at 25 area companies, and parts of it have been incorporated into the health care plans of 150 other companies. Some are saving 50 percent from what they expected to pay in workers' compensation premiums.
"Once you get on a first-name basis with the people in industry and they realize you want to help them, the facades come down," Mr. Gravius said. "And once they see how this works, they're going to start asking themselves whether there are other areas where they can save by collaborating with hospitals."
MedSpan, a Hartford-based subsidiary of Connecticut Health System, the parent company of Hartford Hospital, is a company that grew out of increasing cooperation between businesses and hospitals. MedSpan has brought doctors, hospitals and other health care providers together into a network that offers companies a what is called "managed care" package, to insure that employees receive no more care than necessary, at the lowest possible cost.
Dr. Howard J. Wetstone, medical director of MedSpan, said hospitals welcomed increased corporate scrutiny of, and participation in, health care decisions, because it makes sense. If a company like United Technologies was buying titanium, he said, it could call on several metallurgists to see if it was getting the best material at the best price.
"But in the health care arena, it was not uncommon for a fairly junior person to be making decisions on the kind of benefits a company would be offering," Mr. Wetstone said.
 
'Tweak the System'
 What employers have done, over the last few years, "is tweak the system," said John R. McDonnell, director of marketing and sales for MedSpan. "They've said, 'if we're going to spend this kind of money, show us where it's going.' And they've sat down with us to figure out where the savings might be."
In New London, the president of Lawrence and Memorial Hospital, William T. Christopher, said the hospital was also working on a plan to bring the hospital, the area's doctors and businesses into a network that would give health care providers the volume they needed to provide care at lower cost, so everyone wins.
Providers, insurers and employers are often at odds with one another, Mr. Christopher said, but it does not have to be that way.
"You've got to get at least two of the three players together, at least," Mr. Christopher said. "A providers-employers network is the best combination, because they've got the most to gain, or lose."
 
Push From Clinton
 Everyone agrees that with President-elect Bill Clinton promising to focus on making health care more accessible and affordable, the arrangements are likely to multiply quickly.
"The health care landscape is changing, and the changes are not in the direction of an island mentality, the belief that we can do it alone," Mr. Christopher said. "The change is, more people are thinking we can do more by joining forces.
"You can't do it by yourself anymore, and you don't want to," Mr. Christopher continued. "Hospitals have to look for strategic partnerships -- someone to share the risks, and the rewards."

HEADLINE: WHAT WORKS;
Creating a Space Called School

BYLINE: By JILL JORDAN SIEDER

 BODY:
AFTER 12 years of watching her students perform poorly and express open disdain for the concept of school, Cheryl Deaton, the principal of West Forest Intermediate School in Opelika, Ala., decided to make several radical breaks with tradition. All were designed to remove what she considered to be structural impediments to learning among her students, 57 percent of whom are black and 5 percent Asian, mostly Laotians, and 70 percent of whom come from one-parent, blue-collar families in a town where many adults never graduated from high school and unemployment is high.
Some of those impediments, Mrs. Deaton says, were rules and policies that were too rigid or impractical for her school. Other obstacles derived from the home lives of students, many of whom have never been read to by a parent. Together they produced an environment that was antagonistic toward children, she says. 
 Opelika is a manufacturing town of 21,500 that features textile mills and auto-parts makers; West Forest, which includes grades 3 to 5, had been stigmatized locally as the "backward mill school." But by late 1990 teachers there had assembled a reform plan that would tailor school programs to the needs of the students and their families. That plan was impressive enough to win a $750,000 grant from RJR Nabisco's educational foundation. Local and state school officials then gave the school a green light. Project Space was born.
 
Reading as a Goal
 The reforms had a simple set of objectives: to restructure the school and its teaching methods in a way that would increase student motivation to succeed, improve parental involvement in the learning process and reinvigorate the teaching staff. A primary goal was to increase the amount of time that students and their parents spent reading, individually and together, in hopes that scholastic improvement would follow. Another goal was to transform West Forest into an inviting, not a confining, place to spend the day.
First to go were such time-honored practices as reliance upon textbooks as the primary teaching tool and ability grouping, in which faster learners were channeled into one set of classes and activities while the physically handicapped and slower learners were channeled into another.
Mrs. Deaton did away with the standard classroom setup of rows of desks facing a blackboard and a teacher, which she says takes "ownership of learning" away from students, creating a prison-like atmosphere.
Bells do not ring and students do not change rooms. Children with learning, speech or hearing disabilities are not shuttled out of the main class to another room; the special education teacher comes to them. Anything that smacks of segregated learning, of what Mrs. Deaton calls "the caste system in public schools" that creates undue feelings of inferiority -- or superiority -- had to go.
In its place has come an educational approach based on teamwork and group learning, where teachers plan lessons together, students tutor one another and parents act as policy makers, classroom aides and at-home tutors. For most of the day students remain in the same room, organized into stations of five or six desks that face each other. Ideally, two children of average aptitude are clustered with one faster and one slower learner.
Teachers act more as "learning partners" than as classroom authorities, letting students direct discussions and plan class projects when possible. Disciplinary techniques that emphasize penalties for bad behavior have given way to less confrontational methods. Now, says Mrs. Deaton, a disruptive student is not automatically sent to the principal's office or hallway, but to a "time-out" corner in the classroom "where he can cool off and still benefit from the ongoing instruction." Later the teacher will talk to the student about his conduct and have him fill out a form explaining his actions.
 
Small-Group Lessons
 Many lessons at West Forest are taught with 20 children sitting cross-legged on the carpet in cozy circles, knees touching, encouraging more eye contact and participation. Recently, fourth graders presenting oral book reports in this fashion were so animated in their discussion of "My Girl," the book and the popular film starring the preteen idol Macaulay Culkin, that their teacher, Sylvia Gill, extended the session 20 minutes instead of turning to a scheduled math lesson. That simple move would not have been possible if the state had not waived a policy mandating a tightly segmented school day.
An 18-year veteran of the Opelika school system, Ms. Gill says she was used to having to pry comments out of pupils whose low literacy levels made a reading of a district-recommended classic such as "Charlotte's Web" a chore for many. She attributes the new-found enthusiasm to a curriculum flexibility that allows children and their parents to choose the books they read, noting that literature from the popular culture often reinforces the notion that reading can be fun.
"I was on the verge of early retirement before we changed things around," Mrs. Gill said. "Now I'm seeing the lights go on in their heads again, which is why I got into teaching."
One of those lights has illuminated Melanie Strozier, 11, a fifth grader at West Forest. Formerly shy and troubled about her mother's divorce, Melanie no longer cries in school. Now she leads class discussion and has starred in two class plays. "In the third grade we just went by the book," Melanie said. "It was kind of boring. Now we do all kinds of projects and plays, and read more exciting things, and it's a lot more fun."
Monica Hicks-Crump, 31, said her son, Robbie, a third grader, "began begging me to buy him a telescope and books on astronomy" after his social studies, science, math, art and music classes did an interdisciplinary study of the space age. "He's even asking for encyclopedias," Mrs. Hicks-Crump said. "It's hard to believe."
Elbert Smith, 8, described as a "sometimes mischievous and rambunctious" student, has been behaving better since he began participating in a group counseling session offered to all students every morning. "The counseling group is fun," Elbert said, "because you get to help other people solve their problems. We joke around a bit, and then we have a true talk. It gives us a chance to get to know each other."
One of the most popular features of Project Space is the extended school day, which begins at 7 A.M. with an enrichment period called "Blast-off," to accommodate the 75 or so children whose parents' schedules demand they be dropped off early. Children choose among board games, coloring books, rope-jumping and other activities that prime them for the start of school.
At 2:45 P.M., those enrolled in the "Odyssey" after-school program engage in art, music, athletic and club activities until 5:30, when their parents can pick them up. One day the Lovers of Construction were building houses out of Popsicle sticks, while the Young Astronauts were assembling small-scale working rocket ships.
About two-thirds of West Forest's 400 students participate in at least one of the programs, which cost their parents $7 per week. The financial break it gives single parents who cannot afford day care, much less music instructors, has generated measurable good will among parents. Mrs. Deaton says it is largely responsible for the dramatic increase in parental voluntarism, which zoomed from 25 hours logged among 5 parents in 1990 to 1,500 hours among 75 parents last year.
Tara Burton, for example, is a divorced 28-year-old mother of two who works the third shift, midnight to 8 A.M., on the assembly line of the nearby Uniroyal Tire plant. Ms. Burton, whose son, Anthony, was suspended several times last year for bad behavior, says she used to "cancel out" on parent-teacher conferences, because she had an image of school officials as snobbish. Now she is a regular volunteer in the school library, and a counselor says her presence in the school has helped Anthony to "settle down" in the classroom.
Wanda Lewis, a mother who coordinates a parent volunteer center in the school, says that parents are influencing more than morale. Recently they have brought such multicultural fare into the classrooms as the African-American celebration of Kwanzaa, a tradition emphasizing spirituality and African ancestry; Laotian cuisine and origami, and frank discussions of Malcolm X.
The result, Mrs. Deaton says, is that students are better motivated. Standardized test scores of fourth graders rose significantly last year, while disciplinary problems and suspensions schoolwide have been dramatically reduced. "These kids smile when they walk into the building now," she said.
 
$250,000 in Grants
 Perhaps the best news is that local school officials, politicians and businesses are buying into the project. Mrs. Deaton says she has secured $250,000 in grants from foundations and 13 business partners, including the College of Education at Auburn University.
Auburn students and faculty members are using West Forest for training and teaching purposes, extending professional development and library privileges to the West Forest faculty in turn. The Opelika City Council has appropriated one-third of the $3 million needed for a new school building. And Phil Raley, superintendent of Opelika city schools, says the school district plans to assume the costs of the extended day and parenting programs, and is replicating the cooperative teaching techniques in other district schools.
Still, Mrs. Deaton insists, "Even if we didn't have the money to keep up the wild growth, this school will never be the same again. We've just come too far."

HEADLINE: Open Markets Before Open Societies?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Schools in China Try a Sideline: Making Money" (news article, Dec. 27), on China's national obsession, coupled with your front-page report the same day on the struggle for a free press in Eastern Europe, suggests it is easier to start the pursuit of material well-being than to spread democratic ideas and practices in Communist societies, past or present. 
 Just a day earlier, a New Year's card arrived from one of my college professors, an idealist and traditional Chinese scholar in Beijing, telling of his tearful plea at an academic conference for more Government support to train more professional journalists. While declaring such pleas hopeless, he wrote with much more enthusiasm about the prospects of joint-venture businesses. He invited me and my husband, and our friends in the United States, to make business investments in these projects, for which he would then draw commissions.
From Beijing to Prague and Moscow, such contrasts of frustration and optimism are no rarity. Is there hope for democracy, for higher ideals, when intellectual pursuits operate not in a marketplace of ideas but in the marketplace of profits and losses? Is there hope for democracy, for a more open society, when those in power can still arbitrarily decide what the news media can and cannot say?
Perhaps hope lies elsewhere. Roper's public opinion surveys in the former Soviet Union point to the emergence of a new economic sector of men and women (some of the intelligentsia, some not) whose primary income comes from family businesses, private companies, shareholding or foreign-owned companies. A growing 10 percent to 15 percent of the adult population, they make at least three times as much money as their average compatriots. They are also more likely to support free expression and other individual freedoms.
They may not be spokesmen of democracy yet. But their growing importance in a more open market just might lead to a quest for freedom of information and expression, to political participation and to a more open society.

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: The New Congress;
3 CONGRESSMEN SAY DEFICIT MAY DELAY CLINTON'S TAX CUT

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Three Democratic Congressional leaders said today that a tax cut for the middle class, one of President-elect Bill Clinton's major campaign promises, might have to be put off because of the soaring Federal budget deficit.
The leaders, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, and Representative Vic Fazio of California, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, all made similar comments in nationally televised interviews. 
 Their tone made it clear that the Congressional Democrats, who twice passed bills with middle-class tax cuts last year in efforts to embarrass President Bush, would not hold Mr. Clinton's feet to the same fire and would support his economic proposals, whether or not they emerge with promised tax cuts.
 
Fading Promise
 On Wednesday, Mr. Clinton's spokesman, George Stephanopoulos, used the new, sharply higher Bush Administration estimate of the 1997 deficit -- $305 billion instead of the $237 billion it had forecast in July -- to suggest that it might not be possible for Mr. Clinton to keep his promise to cut the deficit in half in four years.
Mr. Stephanopoulos did not mention the deficit's impact on the tax-cut pledge and would not discuss it directly when asked about it today, saying instead, "As circumstances change, you must examine every part of the program."
A top Republican, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, said today that Mr. Clinton should have known by late summer that the deficit was going to be larger than the Administration's July estimate, and he indicated that he thought Mr. Clinton would have to raise, not lower, taxes.
 
Fairness Issue
 Throughout his campaign, Mr. Clinton said he favored a middle-class tax cut of a few hundred dollars a year. In September his campaign issued a plan saying, "We should cut middle-class taxes immediately by 10 percent." The plan did not define "middle class," but toward the end of the campaign, aides said it covered families with incomes below about $80,000.
The plan also called for "up to an $800-per-child tax credit" as a more valuable replacement for the existing $2,150 exemption. A credit reduces taxes; an exemption reduces the income base on which taxes are calculated.
Later the Clinton campaign said those two cuts were alternatives. Recently the President-elect has argued for a cut, not in hope of stimulating the economy but as a way to undo what he contended was the favoritism toward the rich of tax laws developed under President Ronald Reagan. If the tax system were fairer, he has said, Americans would be more inclined to make other sacrifices.
Mr. Clinton and his aides are developing their economic program but have offered few clues on their thinking. It is apparently taking longer than they had expected.
Congressional leaders have voiced no concern over the delay.
Today on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," Senator Mitchell said, "I think it's more important to make the right decision than it is to make a fast decision, of course, and I think he's doing the right thing in reviewing it very carefully."
 
Pessimism on Tax Cut
 Mr. Foley was asked on the same program if he still thought Congress would pass a middle-class tax cut. He replied: "I'm not sure, in the light of the present circumstances, that that shouldn't be rethought. I really think we might have to look carefully at how extensive a middle-income tax cut should be taken at this time in view of the problems of the deficit."
He said any cut should be aimed at families with children.
Mr. Mitchell said: "I will accept whatever decision President Clinton makes in that regard and support it. I would still like to see the tax code made more fair. If we can do it this year, fine. If we can't, and because of the deficit which you mentioned, which is a serious consideration, then at the earliest opportunity at the future."
Representative Fazio was asked on the ABC News program "This Week" if he wanted a middle-class tax cut. "Personally, I have been for it," he said. "Whether we can afford it under these circumstances is questionable."
 
Consensus Not Orchestrated
 A highly placed Democratic aide on Capitol Hill said there had been no consultation to make sure all three offered the same message. But he agreed that it would have been easy for the Congressmen to avoid answering the question at all, and that, planned or not, their answers reflected a consensus.
But Senator Dole scoffed at the Democrats' assertion that a bigger budget deficit was sudden news, saying Mr. Clinton had been warned in August that the earlier estimates were off.
Mr. Dole said on the CBS News program "Face the Nation" that the warning had come from the Congressional Budget Office. "Congressional Budget Office is Democrats," he said. "He relied on their figures, and they revised their figures in August by about $50 billion, but he ignored those figures. Now he's saying, 'Oh, this is worse than we thought.' "
Recalling President Bush's broken promise not to raise taxes, he said, "It could be 'read my lips' all over again."
Mr. Dole said he might support a gasoline tax increase "if it's dedicated, if you're certain it's going to go into building roads and bridges, or maybe half of it to reduce the deficit." But he said it would be politically difficult to enact.
Mr. Foley also said he favored a higher gasoline tax, but Mr. Mitchell said the time was not right.

HEADLINE: Castro's People Try to Absorb 'Terrible Blows'

SERIES: Cuba Alone -- First of three articles.

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
His island ever more an island, his scraggly beard gone gray, President Fidel Castro stands fast against the winds that have blown away most of the Communist world, along with its subsidies for Cuba and its markets for Cuban goods.
"Only socialism, only the revolution could absorb the terrible blows that we have received," the 66-year-old leader says. 
 Billboards and signs around the country proclaim the same faith. "Join us and you'll make it," promises one just outside Havana. On a wall not far from the Havana airport, the faded scrawl says, "We have Fidel."
 
Mood of Grim Sacrifice
 As the material cost of Cuba's isolation grows, however, its mood these days is less one of heroic struggle than grim sacrifice.
In the long, concrete-block apartment buildings that the revolution built and in the crumbling old Havana homes it subdivided for workers' housing, peoples' memories of meat have begun to fade. Pork, a Cuban favorite, cannot be obtained except on the black market, where one pound costs nearly a week's wages for the average person.
As a beef substitute, a television chef recommends "grapefruit steak." Carefully remove the rind, the recipe goes, season it, cover it with bread crumbs and fry. But in search of more solid food, several Cubans said they had eaten cats.
 
Long Wait for a Bus
 On weekdays, the capital's still-gracious avenues have become gantlets of blank, sullen stares. So many bus routes have been eliminated that the wait for a crosstown ride can take three hours or more. Not a dilapidated, Hungarian-made bus moves that does not spill riders from its doors.
In Trinidad, a quaint colonial town near the center of the island, a woman behind the bus station ticket window allows that the next available reserved seat to Havana is on a bus leaving in three months. But not to worry, she says, there is a waiting list.
To get people to their jobs, a million or so bicycles have been brought from China. Even on major thoroughfares, the workers riding them weave across all lanes of traffic, as though automobiles had never been a concern.
The cars are, in fact, relatively few. From 10 gallons of gasoline some months ago, the monthly rations for most drivers have been cut to about five gallons. In December they got none.
High school students and boiler repairmen can explain this as easily as Government economic officials: With the collapse of the Soviet bloc and its preferential prices for barter trade with the island, Cuba's income has fallen precipitously, while the cost of imports like oil has risen sharply. In 1992, officials said, the island took delivery on about 6 million tons of oil, down from 13 million tons in 1989.
Encouraged by a new trade protocol signed with Russia in November, Cuban officials said they expected about the same amount of oil in 1993. But in December, they extended electrical-power blackouts in Cuba's biggest cities from four hours a day to eight.
The important state offices and enterprises that earn dollars and are exempted from the outages -- hotels, tourist restaurants, certain factories -- flicker like candles in the night. At many intersections, the traffic lights dangle lifelessly from power lines. Television programming has been cut, and even night baseball games have become rare.
Slowly, as the island's imports have fallen by more than three-fourths, cherished social achievements of the revolution have also begun to erode. In the best hospitals, some medicines are being replaced by herbal remedies. Chalk, paper and even milk are sometimes scarce in the schools.
 
Castro Maintains A Core of Support
 In a society that prides itself on a literacy rate comparable to that of industrialized nations, shipments of new books are so infrequent that a modest book fair in December drew a line nearly three city blocks long. Many newspapers and magazines have been shut down for lack of newsprint, and the Communist Party daily, Granma, has become precious not only for its news but as a substitute for toilet paper.
For the first time, the Government has acknowledged a modicum of unemployment because of factories shut down and jobs eliminated. Of about 3.7 million state workers, they say, slightly more than 100,000 now stay at home; many more have been sent off to work in the fields. Foreign economists guess that real unemployment is considerably higher, and that close to half the work force is underemployed.
Still, in hundreds of conversations during a visit of nearly three weeks to the island, it appeared that the Government had managed to maintain a substantial, if unmeasurable, core of support even as it was running out of everything from antibiotics to soap and shoes.
Its health and education systems, although badly strained, continue to function. And while preserving a system of small rewards and perquisites for its partisans, the Government has managed to keep an extremely tight grip on dissent.
Faith that Mr. Castro can restore Cuba to even the relative prosperity it enjoyed with annual Soviet subsidies that once ranged upwards from $3 billion seemed rare even among Cubans supportive of the Government. But many people said they saw their options unchanged: tolerate the hardship or try somehow to leave.
Behind the counter of a grocery store on Havana's southern edge, a heavy-set 28-year-old worker looked out the other evening on the somber customers lined up before him for a cup of oil, some sugar, a few scoops of rice.
"To put up with things," he said, "is a national custom."
Although many Cubans have grown more desperate and some more open about criticizing the Government, there is almost no sign that they are any more willing to challenge its power.
"The level of disenchantment is very high," a Western diplomat said. "But the prospect of anybody doing anything about it is very low because of the danger involved."
In recent months, analysts say, the economy's dramatic contraction has begun to slow. But after a year that Mr. Castro pronounced the most difficult in the difficult 35 years since the revolution, the official forecast is that 1993 may well be even tougher.
 
U.S. Tightens Economic Embargo
 The United States, sensing a chance to succeed where it has failed for three decades, has sought to deepen the island's isolation by tightening its economic embargo. And increasingly, local inefficiency and the loss of solidarity prices from the former Soviet bloc have receded from the official explanation for Cuba's troubles.
Two years after Mr. Castro pronounced the economic crisis "a special period in time of peace," Cubans are being told more and more of an undeclared war being waged against them by the world's last superpower. America's weapon of destruction, the radio and television news repeat, is "the Torricelli Law."
The law, known on the island for its chief sponsor, Representative Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, prohibits foreign subsidiaries of American companies from doing business with the island, and bars foreign ships that trade there from docking at United States ports for six months.
But while economic analysts believe that the law will dissuade some American companies from trading with Cuba, many of them expect that it will merely inconvenience rather than threaten the Cuban Government in the long run.
In the meantime, diplomats and Cuban dissidents said the law had given Mr. Castro a political boost by making it look as though the United States was bullying a small, geopolitically harmless country and adding to the suffering of its captive people. In a vote of the United Nations General Assembly on Nov. 25, many allies of the United States backed Cuba in a non-binding resolution condemning the embargo.
"All the Torricelli law did was to strengthen the only argument that the Government had left for maintaining its intransigent position," said Vladimiro Roca, a moderate political dissident who is the son of one of Cuba's revolutionary heroes, Blas Roca.
As ever, the central theme of official propaganda is that imperialism rather than socialism is at the source of Cuba's problems, and a sense of siege is cultivated. Despite the shortages of materials that have crippled other construction projects, the Government reported that it was able this year to triple the number of "people's tunnels" to be used in the event of a United States attack.
 
Feeding a Family Is a Challenge
 Socialism, in the current formulation, is the guarantee that Cubans will suffer more or less equally.
"What we have, we distribute in the most equitable way possible," Mr. Castro assured members of an American religious group that defied the embargo to bring food to the island in early December. To feed and clothe a family, however, has become an almost herculean task.
"If you have to be at work at eight, you get up before 5 to get the bread," a 48-year-old housewife explained.
The bread allotment, one roll per person, is served with sugary hot water in lieu of coffee. "It does not taste very good, either, but if you don't eat that little bread, you won't have the energy to pedal to work," she said.
The woman, the wife of a once-devout Communist Party member grown disenchanted, looked both slightly haggard and vaguely stylish, and the same could be said of their 1950's-style ranch house in what was once an upper-middle-class neighborhood of Havana. The freezer contained only a brick-like bag of tomato puree; in the refrigerator there were a few eggs and water.
In theory, the woman said she needed to shop only once a month for the family's rice (five pounds per person), beans (one pound) and sugar (four pounds), although it usually took more than one trip to find even that.
Monthly rations of cooking oil (about two cups), soap (half a bar per person), coffee (four ounces) and Chinese toothpaste, which is sometimes used as a detergent substitute, rarely seem to arrive on schedule.
Since the 12-ounce monthly rations of chicken have dried up, the family's butcher has sold them only four items: eggs (four per person each week), small frozen fish, tomato puree and a concoction of soy, gristle and meat remains that is euphemistically called "soy hamburger."
 
Why Everyone Is Not DeadZ
 "If you look at the ration book and you look at what is in the stores, you have to wonder why everyone is not dead," a diplomat said. "The reason is that the black market is flourishing."
In some neighborhoods, the black market -- known as the bolsa, or "exchange" -- is merely the under-the-counter sale of items that are usually rationed over the counter but are skimmed off or otherwise procured by the grocer. Food is often sold surreptitiously from aged delivery trucks, and travelers returning from the countryside are often searched for food bought from farmers. But everyone, it seems, has "contacts."
Many Cubans have some savings in pesos. But since there is so little to buy and demand has risen so sharply, underground prices have spiraled upward with the black-market currency-exchange rate. With the dollar now trading at more than 40 times its official equivalency to the Cuban peso, a $2.75 chicken can cost about the monthly minimum wage of 108 pesos, and a $10 case of beer four times that.
To overcome the obstacles to consumerism or survival is to engage in the fundamental activity of Cuban life: resolviendo, or "resolving things."
One might "resolve" a few liters of gasoline from a relative who works at a service station. A piece of beef might be "resolved" from a pregnant friend who receives it as part of a special ration. But when one's jewelry, tennis shoes and other effects have been sold off, one generally must hustle the currency with which to resolve.
 
'Turned Us All Into Thieves'
 "They have turned us all into thieves," a 28-year-old engineer complained as he hid in a dark corner of a party. The man, who seemed distraught and slightly drunk, described himself as a committed socialist. But he said he had turned to repairing appliances and doing other illicit jobs in his spare time.
"You steal a little here," he said. "You sell a little there. Nobody wants to do it, but everyone does it. We are human. We are weak. We want a pair of shoes. Good cigarettes. And I find myself doing things that are very tough."
The man referred to the young free-lance prostitutes who have become a ubiquitous nocturnal presence in Havana, hissing loudly at tourist cars and offering their companionship to foreigners for a dinner, a dress, some shampoo. "I understand those little girls," he said.
For members of the Cuban elite, there are still special privileges: gasoline for cars, inconspicuous stores where they can shop for imported goods, trips abroad.
Workers who amass hundreds of hours of voluntary service in the fields or factories might still receive bicycles or motorcycles or modest vacations at the beach. But it is no longer unusual to see lieutenant colonels in the army or Interior Ministry riding bicycles, waiting endlessly for buses or even hitchhiking.
From time to time, Mr. Castro betrays what seem to be flashes of pain at seeing his countrymen delivered to a poverty that differs from that of their Latin American neighbors chiefly in that it tends to come with a job, free health care and small portions of food. But while even some Communist Party members express doubts about whether Cubans' patience might last the long years that any real economic recovery would take, their leader shows none.
"It is an epic struggle in which we find ourselves," Mr. Castro told an audience of construction workers recently. "We have had to give up many of the things in which we were involved, but what we will never give up is hope."
Next: Cuba tries to turn the ailing economy around.

HEADLINE: Pollution-Weary Minorities Try Civil Rights Tack

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO

 BODY:
In separate but strikingly similar grass-roots protests, hundreds of black, Hispanic, Asian and American Indian groups are battling pollution hazards by arguing that their neighborhoods have become America's industrial dumping grounds because they are poor and powerless.
Under the banner of environmental justice, these local groups have developed into a powerful new social movement that is applying the language and strategies of the civil rights movement to counter health threats as varied as toxic dumping and lead poisoning. 
 "We are the real endangered species in America, people of color," said Susana Almanza, a leader of a community protest in Austin, Tex., that succeeded last fall in forcing the closing of a gasoline terminal in a black and Hispanic residential area. "We're the ones who are dying with the cancer clusters and the birth defects because of the air we breathe."
 
Evidence of Inequity
 A growing body of evidence that minorities suffer the most from pollution and benefit the least from cleanup programs is transforming environmental politics. Many civil rights and environmental organizations have re-examined their agendas and constituencies, and some are giving grass-roots groups advice and support.
In June, the movement received an important measure of official recognition when a report by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency found evidence that racial and ethnic minorities suffer disproportionate exposure to dust, soot, carbon monoxide, ozone, sulfur, sulfur dioxide and lead, as well as emissions from hazardous-waste dumps.
And just last week in Texas state regulators, citing the E.P.A. study, formed a group to study why environmental hazards are concentrated in minority communities and to see what laws or policies should be changed.
So far, no court ruling has clearly supported claims of civil rights violations in the selection of sites for operations that produce pollution, although several lawsuits are pending. Executives of companies involved in such cases often argue that no discrimination exists and that such decisions are based on a variety of economic factors.
"Not only have we not targeted communities of color, but our facilities are distributed evenly around various demographic groups," said Chuck McDermott, director of political and business issues for Waste Management Inc., a company involved in several disputes.
With little coordination and with no well-known national leaders, the environmental justice movement has developed out of many individual local protests, usually focused on a single nearby problem. No one really knows the movement's size, but in October 1991 about 500 representatives of community groups met in Washington for The First National People of Color Environmental Summit.
The movement in the United States has grass-roots counterparts in many developing nations, like Costa Rica, India and Indonesia. Organizers in the United States and those in third world countries face arguments that pollution is an economic necessity.
 
New Alliances Taking Shape
 The West Dallas Coalition for Environmental Justice is only two years old, but with more than 2,000 members, almost all black or Hispanic, it has become one of the largest and most visible minority organizations in the area. The coalition's cause is to fight for the cleanup of polluted soil from a lead smelter that closed in 1984 after operating for 55 years.
In lawsuits against local, state and Federal agencies and in dozens of protests, the coalition has argued that hundreds of residents suffer from lead poisoning because of discrimination in land use, housing, health and environmental-cleanup policies. As a result, several new testing programs have been started to determine the extent of the pollution and the blood poisoning it caused.
Many health experts say lead is the most widespread environmental hazard in minority communities. The effects of lead poisoning can extend from headaches and nausea to permanent brain damage, especially in children.
Research by the Federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry has shown that lead from plumbing, house paints and contaminated soils reaches many poor children of all races. But in an unexplained disparity, a 1988 study concluded that black children, regardless of their families' income, were much more likely than white children to have unacceptably high levels of lead in their blood.
In some cases, residents have blocked new installations that would have brought jobs to their area. In the past year, the residents of Kettleman City, Calif., most of whom are Hispanic, won a court judgment that has at least temporarily blocked plans for the incinerator in their San Joaquin Valley town, which is already the site of a vast toxic-waste landfill.
And the black residents of Wallace, La., helped scuttle plans to build a $700 million wood pulp and rayon plant on one of the last nonindustrial stretches of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, La.
As local movements have grown and some established national organizations have joined the battle, some new alliances crossing racial and class boundaries have begun to take shape -- though they have been no more free of tensions than have other contacts across racial and class lines.
In New York, for instance, the Natural Resources Defense Council joined with several Harlem groups last fall to file a suit in State Supreme Court contending that smells from the North River Sewage Treatment Plant violate the rights of local citizens to breathe fresh air, and that the operation was placed in a poor community because more politically powerful neighborhoods in Manhattan rejected it.
Ernesto Cortes, southwest director of the Industrial Areas Foundation, a nationwide network of community groups, said: "People used to look at the dump at the end of the block and think it was just a neighborhood problem. Then they saw it in other communities and it became a city problem, then regional, and now, as more information comes out, it's becoming a national issue."
Robert D. Bullard, a sociologist at the University of California at Riverside, is widely credited with conducting the first extensive research that linked an environmental hazard to the race of those exposed to it. In a 1979 study in Houston, he showed that since the 1920's all the city-owned landfills and six of the eight garbage incinerators had been in black neighborhoods even though Houston was once an overwhelmingly white city.
The first solid evidence of inequities on a national scale emerged from a study published in 1987 by the United Church of Christ's Commission for Racial Justice, which found that race, even more than poverty, was the shared characteristic of communities exposed to toxic wastes.
 
Minority Population A Significant Factor
 Through an examination of neighborhoods surrounding commercial hazardous-waste treatment, storage and disposal operations, the study concluded that a large minority population was the most statistically significant factor those communities had in common. And the size of the minority population seemed to grow with the potential environmental hazard so that the proportion of minorities in communities with the largest such operations was three times greater than that of neighborhoods with none.
"The possibility that these patterns resulted by chance is virtually impossible," the report said.
Industry spokesmen argue that instead of looking at the contemporary population near sources of pollution researchers should focus on the makeup of the communities around plants or dumps when they were built. The industry representatives argue that many old industrial operations were surrounded by white working-class neighborhoods that have only recently become minority communities.
Those in the environmental justice movement argue that it matters little whether the pollution was brought into neighborhoods or whether minority groups were steered into already contaminated communities by patterns of residential segregation.
But corporate spokesmen like Mr. McDermott of Waste Management say there are often compelling reasons for the choice of a site that have nothing to do with the makeup of the population. For example, he said, the site of a landfill near the predominantly poor, black town of Emelle, Ala., was chosen largely because an E.P.A. study found that it had the ideal geology.
Lawyers working on behalf of grass-roots environmental groups agree that such arguments can make it virtually impossible to prove intentional discrimination, which is necessary to win most civil rights cases.
"The only way to ever decisively and permanently win these battles is through the political process," said Luke Cole, a lawyer for California Legal Assistance who argued the case against Waste Management in Kettleman City. "When a community organizes itself at the grass roots, we can exercise our power, the power of people."
The people of Wallace, almost all of them black and poor, fought plans by the Formosa Plastics Corporation to build one of the world's largest wood pulp and rayon plants.
"When we started out in 1989, there were a few of us who wanted to ask questions about this thing but we didn't even really know what questions to ask," said Wilfred M. Greene, a 70-year-old retired school principal who became leader of the protests.
The National Toxics Campaign, an environmental organization based in Boston, produced a 19-page report for the people of Wallace in 1990 assessing the pollution the plant might cause.
As Mr. Greene put it, "We could organize and meet all we wanted, but we only really started moving things when we got expertise on our side."
Backed by scientific and legal counsel, the people of Wallace tied up the licensing process until Formosa canceled its plans in October.
 
Two Movements Come Together
 The Rev. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., executive director of the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice, said: "The idea of civil rights is expanding to include freedom from pollution, and an emphasis on social justice is being added to the idea of environmental protection."
Some concepts underlying the civil rights struggle have been used in an environmental cause most prominently in a series of similar lawsuits filed in the last three years in California, Mississippi and Texas. The suits have demanded that poor children get more extensive tests for lead poisoning. Underlying the legal efforts is the assertion that adequate screening for an environmental health hazard is guaranteed under Federal civil rights laws.
Reflecting the alliances formed by the environmental justice movement, the legal teams bringing these cases have included the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund.
The alliance of the established civil rights and environmental organizations with the grass-roots groups has also created friction, often reflecting the different interests of middle-class environmentalists and poor communities, where industries, even polluting industries, have been an essential source of money.
"Working people don't want to live with a dangerous environment, but they do need a viable economic community," Mr. Cortes said. "There have to be plans for a transition, for other jobs, for training. Among people who are well off there is a tendency to assume away those questions, but we can't afford to do that."

HEADLINE: Feeling at Home, Republicans Plan for Exile by the Potomac

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
They descended on Washington in January 1981, snarling at the inside-the-Beltway crowd of fixers, bureaucrats and opinion-makers and pledging to return power to the "real America" beyond the banks of the Potomac.
That was before Republicans discovered that their captured citadel could also be an exciting and exceedingly comfortable place to live and work. So, when a dozen years of Republican hegemony ends next week, the Bush Administration's conservative elite will, by and large, wander but a few blocks into political exile. 
 James A. Baker 3d, the erstwhile Houston lawyer who came to epitomize Republican dominance of government, is becoming a Washington lawyer and writing a book. Margaret Tutwiler, Mr. Baker's confidante who comes from Alabama, hopes to open a Washington public relations firm. Michael Boskin, the Stanford scholar who kept the flame of free-market economics at the White House, is joining a Washington research organization.
Another soon-to-be exile, Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, will join two like-minded allies -- William J. Bennett, the former Education Secretary and director of drug-control policy, and Vin Weber, a former Minnesota Congressman -- to form a Washington research organization that will study (and promote) the brand of "bleeding-heart conservatism" Mr. Kemp likes.
 
Still Tough on Criminals
 One more traditional conservative, Attorney General William P. Barr, will return to the prestigious Washington law firm from which he arose. But he also plans to establish an institute to promote the sort of tough-on-criminals legal philosophy that George Bush honed as a theme.
These are just a few of the former officials who will unpack their files, wall plaques and thousands of Presidential photos -- each autographed and inscribed with warm personal greetings -- in freshly painted offices of fixers, bureaucrats and pundits, virtually in sight of the White House.
In a city where people always come to do good and stay to do well, this is accepted practice. Some even call it healthy. But it also is undeniably ironic. For more than any previous political movement, the revolution begun by Ronald Reagan a dozen years ago and passed on to George Bush was fueled by a dislike for Washington power and self-importance, and respect for the world beyond the capital's affluent suburbs.
There are exceptions, largely at the top: George Bush is retiring to Houston, and Dan Quayle will return to Indiana, probably to head his family's newspaper business and plot a political comeback.
Some other senior officials will return to the hinterlands. Gail R. Wilensky, the senior Bush expert on health and welfare, will rejoin Project HOPE, the international charity where she worked until 1990. Labor Secretary Lynn Martin and Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan have not announced plans, but are expected to take academic posts in Illinois and Georgia, respectively.
A surprising number of others have no place to go. But even they are facing unemployment largely because they hope to find work in Washington that, so far, does not exist for them.
Washington takes two views of this phenomenon. One is that Ronald Reagan's conservative revolution, fueled by the notion that the free market, not government, should make most decisions, has been domesticated by the creature comforts of a dozen years in power. Another is that the Republicans are finally doing what Democrats have done for decades, and it is about time.
"What this means is that there's going to be a lively counter-government -- a government in exile, if you will," Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution scholar and first-order opinion-maker, said last week. "The Eisenhower people, by and large, were old and left in retirement when his term ended. The Nixon people left in disgrace. This group is leaving, but wanting to come back -- at least the younger ones."
Mr. Hess was mostly referring to decisions by some leading Administration figures to postpone the usual fates of former politicians -- lawyering, lobbying and Wall Street -- so that they can join research organizations and wage the bloody fight for control of Republican political philosophy.
Mr. Quayle's chief of staff and the Administration's house intellectual, Bill Kristol, will spend the next year in Washington leading a nonpartisan program, sponsored by the conservative Bradley Foundation, to review American priorities. Mr. Kristol says that removes him from party politics for a while. On the other hand, it also provides him a springboard.
"It's not that I'm not interested in helping shape the future of the party; sure I'm interested in that," he said. "My one conclusion in the last two months is that we do need fresh thinking. We can't simply cobble back together something that has broken apart" with Mr. Bush's defeat.
 
Both Fish and Fowl

Half research outfit and half advocate, organizations like Mr. Kemp's and Mr. Barr's are something new for Republicans, say Mr. Hess and others. They parrot groups like the Progressive Policy Institute and the Democratic Leadership Coalition that moderate Democrats used in the last decade to create an image of the party that voters would approve of.
"It's the taste of defeat that leads to various kinds of institutional responses," said Thomas Mann, another Brookings student of the Presidency. "There's a real need for some rethinking in the Republican Party, and now there are some bright, aggressive and more ambitious people coming together to do it."
Other Administration leaders, some with no less burning ambitions, are taking refuge in more traditional, nonpolitical research units. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, whose desire to run for President is unvarnished, will join the conservative American Enterprise Institute, as will his wife, Lynne, who headed the National Endowment for the Humanities until recently.
 
Plenty of Scholars
 Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski will also go to the enterprise institute. Constance Horner, a onetime high-school teacher who rose to become director of Presidential personnel, will go to Brookings as a scholar in governmental studies.
As for the rest of Mr. Bush's senior aides, their lot is varied. Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger has not disclosed his plans, but friends expect him to serve on some corporate boards and conduct some intellectual pursuits. Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, is similarly mum; associates who note his recent flurry of television morning-show appearances say he appears to be building up name recognition for a public-speaking tour.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, wealthy enough not to need a job, has told friends that he will find one anyway but that he does not know yet what it will be.
 
Books in the Works
 A whole sheaf of soon-to-be-former officials are planning books. Among them are Richard G. Darman, the budget director, who is also said to be contemplating a career on Wall Street, and Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary.
The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, William K. Reilly, has said he is going to Brazil for a month to forget about Government and politics.
And at least a dozen senior White House officials are still plotting their futures, some because they must choose among offers and some because opportunities for Republicans, in a Washington free market where the demand runs Democratic, is scant.
Those who have already made the transition say parting is not all that sweet. "The nostalgia will set in this weekend for those who are still there," one said. "You don't have the luxury of peering into the Oval Office in the evening, on the way out of work. Suddenly, you've got to peer through the iron gates on Pennsylvania Avenue, like everybody else. Sure, you'd be crazy not to miss it."

HEADLINE: Anchorage Journal;
Again, Readers Can Hear Voice of Native Alaska

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE

 BODY:
Inside a glass cage on the second floor of the Anchorage Museum of History and Art is a Royal Standard typewriter that once belonged to Howard Rock, a legendary Eskimo journalist who died in 1976. On the keys of that old machine Mr. Rock pounded out exposes, editorials and everything in between for the pages of The Tundra Times.
One year ago, the paper Mr. Rock helped found seemed headed for museum status, next to his typewriter. The Tundra Times, which has long called itself Alaska's oldest statewide newspaper and is the only journalistic voice for this state's 80,000 aboriginal people, ceased publication in December 1991, a victim of heavy debt. 
 "When I heard that news it put me in a state of shock, as if a part of me had died," said Thomas Richards Jr., a former editor of the paper. "The first thing I did was hop on my snow machine and spend a couple of days chasing ptarmigan across the tundra."
But now The Tundra Times is back, pumped to new life a few months ago by dozens of small investors. The revived publication -- which comes out weekly, as before, with a circulation of about 7,000 subscribers -- seems a bit thinner than usual, but it has retained a familiar feistiness.
In years past, the paper wrote about sweatshop labor conditions of Aleuts at fish canneries, land grabs on native property, what drugs and alcohol were doing to certain villages. In resuming publication, the paper carried numerous articles about the outrage felt by Eskimos over the news that the Federal Government had buried radioactive material near the village of Point Hope in the early 1960's and never told the people about it.
It was Mr. Rock's crusade against nuclear experimentation in the Arctic that helped define The Tundra Times during its first year in operation, 1962. His articles are credited with helping bring together many of the native villages.
The paper serves an enormous area in which there are three principal native groups: Eskimos in the far north, Aleuts near Anchorage and the coastal areas, and Athabaskan Indians in the interior.
The front page of every issue of The Tundra Times gives a hint that what is inside is different from any other paper in the nation. On the masthead is a sketch of moose, caribou, a whaling skiff and Eskimos being pulled by sled dogs.
There are articles about reindeer, or hunting whales but also pieces on village politics, sports and banking tips.
Any reader can contribute. Thus, Grace Slwooko wrote in from the small village of Gambell in a recent issue: "The wind has been blowing so hard from the north that the seafoods we eat are drifting in at the shore. We eat those vegetable-like things that drift in at our shore with our meats."
The Tundra Times operates out of a small office in Anchorage, where the lights burn in winter darkness that stretches through mid-morning. Marilyn Richards, the editor and publisher, has been working 60- to 90-hour weeks since the paper resumed publication.
"Every native owns a piece of the Tundra Times, in some way," Ms. Richards said. "Without this paper, native concerns would not be aired."
Like other Americans, Alaska's native people are concerned now about jobs and education, Ms. Richards said. Opinion is sharply divided over how much of the old hunting and fishing life style should be sacrificed to keep pace with modern Alaska, a state that has been reinvented with the infusion of oil money in the last two decades.
Too often, Ms. Richards said, other newspapers and the television stations bring out the stereotype of native people. She criticized an Anchorage Daily News series on native social ills that won a Pulitzer Prize in 1989.
"It was good reporting, but the underlying current was that all natives are alcoholics or drug abusers," she said. "We try to stress role models and economic development."
The primary economic concern for Ms. Richards for the next year is the paper itself. The fall political season was good for the paper, as politicians took out large advertisements to court the native vote. But now the papers are thin.
The Tundra Times will not make a profit, Ms. Richards said, but it should break even. The goal is to avoid ending up in a glass cage next to Howard Rock's typewriter.

HEADLINE: China Builds Its Military Muscle, Making Some Neighbors Nervous

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Buoyed by a strong economy, China is making far-reaching improvements in its armed forces, leaving many Asian countries feeling increasingly threatened by the behemoth in the neighborhood.
While there is no sign that a war is likely any time soon, some military experts say that the equipment China is acquiring from Russia and other countries may upset the balance of power in Asia by the end of the decade. 
 Among the key items China is buying or developing are new classes of military ships, new fighter planes, better radar systems, new tanks and aerial-refueling technology. The Communist Party leadership has even approved in principle the eventual acquisition of an aircraft carrier.
 
The Big Kid on the Block
 Most fundamentally, some diplomats believe, China may intend to fill the military vacuum that it perceives in the Pacific Ocean after the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the withdrawal of the United States from bases in the Philippines.
"China is moving from a regional power to a regional superpower," said Paul Beaver, publisher of Jane's Defense Weekly in London. "That doesn't upturn the balance of power completely, but it does cause a lot of ripples."
The growing strength of the People's Liberation Army would not be so much of a concern if China did not have border disputes with at least seven neighbors. China still threatens regularly to use force to recover Taiwan, and over the last three decades it has fought border wars or skirmishes with India, the Soviet Union and Vietnam.
China also claims the entire South China Sea, including major shipping routes that carry oil from the Middle East to Japan. Over the last year it became more aggressive about asserting the borders it says are its own.
"They've really got a very major build-up going on," said a senior diplomat from one of China's neighbors. "It could be quite dangerous."
 
Asking Nervously, What's Next?
 Singapore's Defense Minister, Yeo Ning Hong, warned recently that China's assertiveness in the South China Sea "has aroused distrust and suspicion" among the five other nations with claims in the area.
He cautioned that even if a generational transition takes place smoothly in China, "countries in the region may still be uncertain about how an economically stronger China will behave in the longer term."
Some Western diplomats and scholars are much less alarmed, with concern receding in proportion to the distance of their home countries from China. They also note that China historically has tended to be a brooding, inward-looking country.
"Trying to become a superpower would be completely opposite to the tradition of the Chinese, because they never went outward on a grand scale," a European diplomat said.
Partly for this reason, no one seems to think that China might some day try to conquer Japan, Indonesia or other countries that it did not control in the past. China is not expansionist in that sense, nor is it being entirely unreasonable in its territorial claims, which involve complex historical arguments and ambiguities. To outsiders there often is no clear right or wrong.
The fundamental problem is that China lost huge chunks of territory over the past 150 years in periods when it was powerless. These days China may be increasingly able to resolve the resulting border disputes in its favor.
A map published by China in a 1954 textbook underscores the possibilities for conflict. The map, which is reprinted in a recent book by John W. Garver, "Foreign Relations of the People's Republic of China," delineates a Chinese view of its sphere of influence in the 19th century and early 20th century.
 
Capitalism vs. Militarism
 This encompassed Nepal, half of Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Indochina, Taiwan, North and South Korea, Mongolia and large swatches of Russia. While these areas have been influenced by China, most are not normally thought of as its 19th-century territories.
There is no sign that China wants to "recover" these countries, but a sense of territorial loss lingers in the background of any discussion of China's military aspirations.
"Nobody is interested in expanding our borders," said an independent-minded Chinese lawyer. "Everybody just wants to make money, and militarism would get in the way of that."
The military equipment that China is acquiring comes in large part from Russia, which seems to have decided that income from the sales outweighs the fear of arming a potential enemy. But some also comes from Iran, Europe, Israel and the United States.
 
A Long Shopping List
 The Army is being upgraded in almost every area, but military experts describe these crucial improvements:
*China has purchased 26 advanced fighter planes, Su-27's, from Russia, and is said to be considering the purchase of many more. The Air Force is also interested in buying Mig-31's and in developing joint production with Russia of fighters or short-takeoff jets.
*The Air Force is developing aerial refueling for the Su-27's and for its bombers. This will substantially increase the ability of the armed forces to threaten Taiwan and Vietnam or to control the South China Sea.
*The Communist Party has decided in principle to acquire an aircraft carrier, according to a confidential speech by President Yang Shangkun. Most experts doubt that China will buy a huge Ukrainian carrier that it once considered; instead it may purchase a smaller Russian carrier or build its own.
*China is developing military ships: the Jiangwei class of frigates, the Luhu class of destroyers and a vastly upgraded version of the older Luda class destroyers. The new ships have surface-to-surface missiles and electronic warfare abilities that let China patrol ocean waters farther out than just along the coast.
*The military is acquiring vastly improved radars and missile-guidance systems from Russia and elsewhere.
*Beijing is believed to be negotiating the purchase of Russian S-300 missiles, which are similar to the American-made Patriots.
*The Army is working on a new model of its main tank that could be an important factor in any ground war.
 
Where the Money Comes From
 These improvements are possible because of the strength of the nation's economy, which grew 12 percent in 1992. The official military budget increased by one-third over the last three years, even after inflation, but these figures are extremely misleading: They do not include capital expenditures on equipment and do not take account of huge sums that the Army earns from weapons sales and from its factories, which make everything from clocks to refrigerators.
While the official budget for 1992 was $6.85 billion, the real amount was probably at least twice that. Even so, military spending amounts to only a bit more than 3 percent of the gross national product, less than in some other countries in Asia and elsewhere.
China has nuclear weapons pointed at some of its neighbors, principally Russia, but these seem to unnerve Asian countries less than the boom in spending on the Navy and Air Force, almost all of it on equipment that would enable China to project its power beyond its shores.
 
An Eye on South Asia
 Another cause for concern is mounting intelligence that China may be selling weapons to Myanmar in exchange for the right to set up naval facilities and listening posts on islands off the Burmese coast.
Chinese leaders are trying to assuage the concerns. China's Ambassador to Great Britain, Ma Yuzhen, declared last month that it is "absolutely not true" that China is "filling the vacuum left by the superpowers."
For now, China's military forces are still regarded as second or third rate by Western experts. Fighter pilots have only about 80 hours of air training a year, less than half the level in NATO countries, and it is said that China had to ask Russian pilots to bring the Su-27 fighter jets to their new home bases because the newly trained Chinese pilots were not good enough.
"In general, China is no better equipped than Iraq was," said Keith Jacobs, an expert on the Chinese military who is based in the United States. However, Mr. Jacobs added, by 2000 China may be in a much stronger position than it is now.
 
New Post-Soviet Missions
 The Chinese military, like that of the United States, has been struggling to redefine its mission after the collapse of its prime potential enemy, the Soviet Union. The goal the military has come up with, at least tentatively, is two-fold: repression of internal dissent and guarantees for Chinese commercial interests in disputed regions.
Most experts believe that the South China Sea is the likeliest spot for a conflict to erupt, in part because it is claimed in all or in part by China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei. Vietnam and China have fought several brief naval battles in the area over the years, as well as a ground war in 1979.
The Army has published a new book, "I Love the Spratly Islands," that seems aimed at dredging up nationalist sentiment for the claims to the area, which includes the Spratly archipelago. For now there is no sign that China will interfere with international shipping, but Beijing might, for example, ban Japan from shipping plutonium through the sea.
The principal territorial dispute with Japan is over the Diaoyu Islands, known in Japan as the Senkakus, which lie northeast of Taiwan. These are uninhabited and for now, neither Tokyo nor Beijing seems ready for a military confrontation.
As for India, which China fought in 1962, much of the common border remains in dispute but for now both countries seem intent on focusing instead on how to improve diplomatic and economic relations. Likewise, China fought border skirmishes with the Soviet Union in 1969, but relations with Russia have improved and new fighting is thought unlikely any time soon.
 
A Rejuvenated Nationalism
 China's interest in picking fights will depend in part on the degree of nationalism among its people.
Michel Oksenberg, president of the East-West Center in Hawaii, noted a concern that many diplomats and scholars share about the Communist Party's efforts -- with mixed success so far -- to win popular support by cultivating nationalistic pride.
"On the side of factors that could induce a more muscular or assertive foreign policy," Mr. Oksenberg said, "I would put high on the list the effort to use nationalism as a substitute for Marxism as a unifying ideology."

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Live on Inaugural Stage, Symphony of Diversity

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Kenny Rogers, Harry Belafonte, Diana Ross and many other performers who will appear in the "Call for Reunion" concert next Sunday last came together for "We Are the World," the gathering of recording artists that brought attention and money to famine-stricken Ethiopia in 1985.
The cellist Yo-Yo Ma was not there, nor was the rapper L. L. Cool J. But both will be on hand on Sunday, stretching the limits of musical togetherness on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial for the concert that will kick off a week of activities for Bill Clinton's inauguration. 
 The list of 28 acts includes performers as diverse as Mary Chapin Carpenter, the folk-country artist, and Sounds of Blackness, a Minneapolis gospel choir. When the lineup was announced, a few onlookers wondered at what point diversity would become cacophony.
James Ingram, the soul balladeer, isn't worried. He does not know Yo-Yo Ma, but he knows Quincy Jones, the impresario behind this exercise in Big Music.
"Quincy's probably still putting it together," Mr. Ingram said. "But Quincy's known for pulling the star-studded phenomena off. He used to have a sign up telling everybody to leave their egos at the door."
While Mr. Ingram and his fellow musicians sing, and actors like James Earl Jones and Liv Ullman offer recitations from historical documents, artists of a different sort will be waiting on barges in the Potomac River.
When their time comes, employees of the Grucci Company of Brookhaven, L.I., will set off a fireworks display with the first and biggest saxophone motif of the week: a 30-by-60-foot sparkling silhouette of the President-elect and his favorite instrument.
 
The Bells, The Bells
 Speaking of cacophony, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is telling the Presidential inaugural committee, with regret, that it does not have a shuttle astronaut to spare for the national bell peal.
Mr. Clinton and Vice President-elect Al Gore are scheduled to set off a simultaneous frenzy of coast-to-coast bell-ringing at 6 P.M. Eastern time next Sunday when they strike the first note on a replica of the Liberty Bell at the Arlington Memorial Bridge after the concert. Inaugural planners had hoped that the astronauts aboard the shuttle Endeavour, scheduled to be launched this week, would chime in.
But on the astronauts' sleep cycle, the appointed hour is the equivalent of 2 A.M.
Although NASA declined to awaken the astronauts for Sunday's bell ringing, it said they could join in by video proxy. "As early in the flight as we had the chance, the crew could make their presentation and bell ringing live to the ground," said Jeff Carr, a NASA spokesman. "We would record it here at Houston and provide that tape to the inaugural committee."
 
The Balls, The Balls
 The inaugural committee maintains a militantly egalitarian posture about the 11 inaugural balls on Wednesday: all are equal. But in a town constantly calibrating its rankings of the "in" and the "out," such neutrality cannot last. People want to know which events are more equal than others.
A quick rule of thumb: the more "out" something was perceived to be under the Republicans, the more "in" it is perceived to be now.
In keeping with this proposition, the reception on the afternoon of Tuesday, Jan. 19, for the Victory Fund to benefit gay and lesbian candidates is sold out, said Robert Deaton, a gay Arkansan familiar with the planning. He says he still hopes to find an invitation for his rabbi from Little Rock.
Another party on Tuesday for Emily's List, the organization that raises money for female political candidates, is attracting large numbers of Arkansans, Mr. Deaton said. Since Arkansans and female candidates both used to be out, the effect may be the social equivalent of in<2>.
For those who trace their origins to Arkansas, the events of choice are rebelliously informal gatherings of Arkansans.
The most rebellious of these, perhaps, is the party of the L.O.T.L. Society, a new group taking its name from George Bush's remark that Arkansas was "the lowest of the low" in key economic indicators. The group's logo -- a buzzard perched on the corner of the state holding an elephant (remember the campaign ad with the rushing storm clouds and the buzzards?) and declaring "We Ain't Trash No More" -- sold enough T-shirts to pay for an all-Inauguration Day bash.

HEADLINE: World-Class Research, for a Song

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLMDEL, N.J.

 BODY:
As the collapsing Russian economy began to threaten the republic's most respected research institutions last year, several American companies recognized a grand opportunity. They began to hire Russian scientists on the cheap, for the equivalent of a few dollars per month per scientist.
The companies, including the likes of Sun Microsystems and Corning, did it to provide a research roof over the heads of some of the world's most eminent scientists and also to help solve problems that have long baffled American researchers. Now, for example, from Russia to A.T.& T. Bell Laboratories comes the smiling, jeans-clad husband-and-wife team of Aleksei N. Pilipetski and Yekaterina A. Golovchenko.
 
Young, Gifted and Russian
 Both Ms. Golovchenko and Mr. Pilipetski are 30 years old, but look much younger, and both are scions of distinguished scientific families. His grandfather, Yakov Zeldovich, was a colleague of Andrei Sakharov, the physicist, and an expert on black holes and neutron stars. Ms. Golovchenko's grandfather, Sergei Mardashev, was a prominent biochemist whose research helped to preserve the bodies of Lenin and Stalin. 
 The young physicists from Moscow are experts in waves and nonlinear optics. It is a field that may someday result in a telephone cable that carries 10 times the data of the most advanced cables today and more than 1 million times the capacity of an ordinary household phone line.
During their three weeks recently working for Bell Labs here, the couple helped with a perplexing problem that destroys the ability of the advanced phone cable to carry information at all.
"Aleksei has already made a large contribution to the theory of acoustic interference," said Linn Mollenauer, a senior scientist at Bell Labs who was the couple's host in the United States. "It was a revelation to us."
 
Bountiful Harvest of Scientists
 The nature of Russian Communism has always meant a bountiful supply of top scientists like Ms. Golovchenko and Mr. Pilipetski. While huge research labs like Bell Laboratories, with 18,000 scientists and researchers, are the exception in the United States, they are the rule in Russia.
Murray Feshbach, a Georgetown University professor who is an expert on Russian science, said the former Soviet Union emphasized size, duplication and narrowness of research topics, but paradoxically had poorly equipped research facilities.
The military ruled research, Mr. Feshbach said, so that even civilian-oriented facilities like the General Physics Institute had many military-related projects. Each institute had its own patron within the ruling Communist Party, so when there was doubt about which of two similar labs would get funding, both would.
Also, the larger the staff, the more power for the institute's directors, so there was no incentive for institutes to cut research employees. But because the best equipment went to the military, many civilian projects suffered.
This wasteful allocation of rubles led to advances in theoretical research, Mr. Feshbach said, but rarely in commercial applications that would result in, say, a factory's using redesigned equipment. "They didn't want to do something different because they might fail," he said. "If they made junk, they at least made junk efficiently."
The future of Russian science will depend largely on what happens to the Russian Government and economy, both of which are in turmoil. For the moment, Ms. Golovchenko and Mr. Pilipetski are grateful simply to be employed.
 
Programs Sustain Russians
 American companies using Russian researchers merely pick up the salary -- negligible by United States' standards -- those researchers would otherwise be paid. Yet, Ms. Golovchenko said, programs like the one at Bell Labs are vital for organizations like the General Physics Institute, where the couple works. "It will let our department survive because it is so hard to make ends meet today," she said.
Like other Russian research institutes that have accepted American help, General Physics, which employs more than 1,200 scientists and researchers, does not want to pay one researcher, say, $132 in equivalent annual salary and another, American-subsidized researcher $70,000. Such disparities could breed jealousy in the Russian labs, and if an agreement with an American company ends, the suddenly wealthy researcher is poor once again.
The couple makes 5,000 rubles apiece per month, equivalent to less than $11 at current exchange rates. A splurge at a Moscow supermarket of good-quality meat, fruit and other foodstuffs might cost 1,000 rubles, Ms. Golovchenko said.
Being paid a pittance, at least in dollar terms, did not bother Mr. Pilipetski. "We have to prove we are worth it," he said.
 
Sun Microsystems a Pioneer
 American-Russian cooperation was pioneered in the summer of 1991 by Sun Microsystems, a computer maker in Mountain View, Calif. Sun hired a team of 50 Russian computer software and hardware designers in 1991 and took on another team of 50 researchers recently.
David R. Ditzel, director of advanced systems for Sun Microsystems, said, "We've had a couple of surprises already. The Russians built a graphical user interface -- the way things are manipulated by a mouse, let's say -- that was far better than anything we built."
And on the same day that A.T.& T. announced its arrangement in May, Corning Inc. also agreed to hire 115 scientists and technicians at the Vavilov States Optical Institute in St. Petersburg, the world's biggest research center on optics, and at the Institute for Silicate Chemistry, which specializes in the study of useful forms of glass. A half-dozen Russian researchers visited the Corning laboratories last year to consult on research in glass materials and optical electronics.
But perhaps the most ironic project is at Bell Labs. Russia has some of the most backward phone service in the world. As recently as 1987, A.T.& T., the only big international carrier in the region, had enough international long-distance circuits for just 16 conversations. This year, communications are being rapidly modernized, but for a country of its size, Russia will stay outdated for decades.
Bell scientists have been experimenting with a wave form called solitons that can travel through a variety of different media. Unlike light waves used in fiber-optic lines, soliton waves do not lose their shape over distances. They are like a shout that doesn't fade. Solitons may lead to huge increases in capacity over longer distances. But Bell researchers needed help with factors that disturb soliton waves, including a variety of acoustic interferences.
"I worked with a similar problem in Moscow," Mr. Pilipetski, who has published a paper about acoustic effects on soliton waves, said. "So it was quite natural for me to understand the problem that was facing Bell Labs."

HEADLINE: Ticking Into an Uncertain Future

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
He is a practitioner of an ancient craft, a watchmaker who for years has repaired old timepieces, salvaged heirlooms and struggled with more than a few stubborn hairsprings along the way. But at the age of 59, after three decades of working and teaching, Frank Shank realizes time is catching up with him, and he is thinking about retiring before long.
Time, and technology, have also caught up with his trade; its veterans are reaching retirement without nearly enough people to replace them. And while the watchmaking school where he works in Queens has managed to survive, it has survived despite a fear of obsolescence that kept many from the trade. 
 "We have to find people to do what I do," Mr. Shank says.
There was a time, through the first half of the century, when Mr. Shank's trade thrived, when watchmakers were vital artisans and watches were more than just timepieces but keepsakes, too.
But that began changing by the 1970's, as inexpensive, disposable watches flooded the market in an era known to the makers of classic mechanical watches as the "quartz scare." Many people avoided the trade, seeing no future in it, and the number of watchmakers in the nation dropped, from about 35,000 in 1960 to only about 10,000 today. And more than half of them, their ages averaging between 55 and 60, are expected to retire in the next few years.
Yet the nation's few remaining watchmaking schools train only a small number of students, a fraction of what is needed to revive the trade.
Today, these schools, like the Joseph Bulova School in Woodside, are crossroads for a mix of romantics drawn by the mystique of an arcane craft and industrious newcomers who see an opportunity for a career when jobs are scarce.
The other day at the school on 62d Street, which is not affiliated with the Bulova watch company, Mr. Shank stooped over a workbench inside a classroom amid the hissing of Bunsen burners and the grating of the steel files of students who, in an age of mass production, have dedicated themselves to a meticulous art.
Mr. Shank, whose hands are thick but sure, is not given to small talk at his bench -- scanning his students' work, one watch after another, with intense concentration. His instructions are often terse, but he makes no apologies for his stern manner.
 
Pride in Their Work
 "When they first come up to show me their work, they're afraid of me," said Mr. Shank, who plans to retire in three years. "And I like it that way. But then they start getting proud of their work, getting confident. And that's the turning point."
When Brian Murphy first walked into the school four years ago, there were only four other students in his class. He still recalls the risk, a sense that he had entered a doomed craft. "I wondered if the school would close before I finished the program," said Mr. Murphy, a 35-year-old rising star in the trade.
His concern was not unfounded. Watchmaking schools have dwindled from 35 to 22 in the last decade, and the Bulova School itself has struggled with declining enrollment until about a year and a half ago. But Mr. Murphy's commitment to the craft was deep. Within a year, he graduated from the Bulova School and in 1991 went on to apprentice at a trade school and factory in Switzerland.
Today he is the youngest instructor at the Bulova School and helps train about 30 students, who when they graduate are eagerly recruited for jobs that pay $23,000 to $30,000 a year to start.
"I believe there is a future in this work," Mr. Murphy says of his industry, which has seen a revival of interest in mechanical watches and the production of more complicated quartz watches that require the experienced hand of a watchmaker.
Sameera Nazy, 33, who enrolled at the school in 1991, agrees. She has seen firsthand just how badly the industry needs new watchmakers, having worked at her family's jewelry shop in Paramus, N.J., a business that like others has had difficulty getting the watches of its customers repaired promptly.
The business has been forced to send them to a watchmaker in Manhattan who, flooded with work from other shops, couldn't get the repairs done for weeks. The situation got so bad that the business lost customers. "But they end up coming back because it's not better at other stores," she said. "Every jewelry store in the area has the same problems, unless they have their own watchmaker."
Though she is just a few months from graduating, Ms. Nazy hasn't entirely adopted the idiosyncratic ways of her new colleagues, whose stretches of unbroken silence have annoyed her. She is more than willing to strike up a conversation with people wandering past her workbench and breaks up the monotony of the day by teasing others in the room.
One day an instructor walked over and began to whisper to her. "Is there a reason you're whispering?" she recalled snapping at the man. "Are you afraid that I might hear you?"
Even Frank Shank looks up from his bench, smiling at her antics. "This business has changed a lot," he says.

HEADLINE: Florio to Stress Fiscal Recovery in Address

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Trying to capitalize on warmer relations with the Republican leadership in the Legislature, Gov. Jim Florio will propose no new taxes when he delivers his State of the State Message Tuesday, aides to the Governor say.
They say the Governor, who is up for re-election in November, plans to emphasize a "new spirit of cooperation" with the Republican majority that swept into office on a tide of resentment over the $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990. 
 The aides were at pains to deny any overtly political motive in the address, but in what is certain to be a year of intense maneuvering, the State of the State Message is inevitably the opening gambit. In it, the Governor plans to position himself as the steady pilot who steered the ship of state out of the recession and put it on a course to recovery.
"It is an extension of last year's State of the State in that it is dominated by economic development and jobs creation," said Jon Shure, the Governor's director of communications. "But last year's was about jump-starting the economy in the midst of the national recession.
 
Beyond Surviving Recession
 "This year, it is not just about surviving the recession, but what kind of state we will be afterward."
The Republicans, who have veto-proof majorities in both chambers, also have a vested interest in retaining their strength in a year when voters seem to have a greater interest in effective governing than political posturing. In recent weeks, they have made it clear that the Governor will not be allowed to steal all the political thunder on the jobs front.
No sooner had Mr. Florio appointed a new Chief of Economic Recovery -- a registered Republican who managed a potential opponent's gubernatorial campaign in 1989 -- than the Republican Legislature appointed its own joint Legislative Committee on Economic Recovery and called the new "jobs czar" before it just last week before the Governor's State of the State Message Tuesday. "Cooperation" was the keynote.
In his address, the Governor also will rule out any fare increases for N. J. Transit, his aides said. Among other issues, he will discuss the need for a permanent method of financing shore protection after two years of devastating storms, and the creation of a Transportation Board of Trustees to develop a plan to replace the Transportation Trust Fund when it expires in 1995.
 
College Leadership Program
 The Governor will also introduce a progam for college students, to be called College Leadership New Jersey, to inform students of issues facing the state and develop leaders to solve them.
Few details were given about any of the Governor's new initiatives. But the state's new "jobs czar," Robert E. Hughey, alluded on Thursday to a loan fund that would provide loans at 1.5 percent interest for public and private development. It would be part of an accelerated development program that would pump as much as a billion dollars into the state's economy over the next year or so.
The Governor in his address is expected to call for another shore conference, like the one last year, to bring together lawmakers, tourism officials and others to discuss shore issues, in particular the failure last year to provide a permanent system of financing shore protection and refurbishment projects. The need for such a system was underscored yet again late last year when a severe storm swept dunes out to sea, ripped up boardwalks and otherwise devastated the state's premier tourist attraction.

HEADLINE: Tributes to Neighborliness Aid Neediest

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Amid all the heated debates over race and religion in New York City, Lila Soll would like to get a word in edgewise. If she could have a few moments to speak, she could describe a heartening experience she had on Thanksgiving that seemed, for her at least, to symbolize the real state of relations in the city.
Ms. Soll had to stop her car on the rain-slicked Long Island Expressway in Queens because of a flat tire. One after another, two black men and one Hispanic man came by and helped make the repairs, she wrote in a letter to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund that she included with a check on behalf of her family. 
 "We want to acknowledge their generosity and caring in a city famous for violence and racial strife," said Ms. Soll, who lives in Manhattan and sent $250 to the fund in honor of the three men.
"As Jews," she added, "we are appalled by the shouting matches in Crown Heights and feel there is too little recognition of the many examples of blacks, Hispanics and Jews offering each other a helping hand in the workplaces or the streets and even on the highways of New York City."
Many contributors give money to the Neediest Cases because they want to thank people who have left a mark on their lives -- whether from a chance encounter, a summertime friendship or a lifelong relationship.
Eunice B. Edelman of Yonkers, N.Y., sent $25 to the fund in honor of neighbors whose quick thinking averted certain disaster.
"Their selfless and swift response prevented our house from being completely destroyed when a water pipe burst in our absence, causing flooding from the rush of water," Ms. Edelman wrote. "Disaster can strike when you least expect it!"
The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund is mounting its 81st annual campaign amid a relentless recession in New York City that has heaped added burdens upon charities. Many are trying to aid growing numbers of newly unemployed while also providing food, shelter, clothing and health care to countless others.
The New York Times pays the expense of the Neediest Cases appeal, so all donations go directly to seven charities. This year's campaign ends on Feb. 28.
For the third year in a row, Peter K. Reville of Stamford, Conn., sent $100 to the fund in honor of his parents.
"As I look forward to my pending marriage and starting a family, I only hope that I can be as understanding and supportive as my parents have been with me and my siblings," Mr. Reville wrote. "My parents are very special, and I am lucky to have them -- not only as parents, but as friends. I realize that other people aren't so lucky, and fortunately there are charities, like yours to help them."
And Rachel M. Weinberger of Manhattan sent $50 in memory of her father.
"When I am caught in the Hanukkah/Christmas spirit (and frenzy!)," she wrote, "I find myself thinking often of my father, who died in May -- reminded not only of lighting the menorah, but also of wondering whether he ate the cookies I left for Santa!"

Schwarzkopf's Strategy Wins in Bookstores, Too

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN

 BODY:
General H. Norman Schwarzkopf's autobiography is called "It Doesn't Take a Hero." But that is apparently exactly what it took to make this book an overwhelming success and to overcome the skepticism of a broad range of people in the publishing industry who doubted that it could sell enough copies to earn back the author's multimillion-dollar advance.
When Bantam Books beat out several other publishers in June 1991 and signed General Schwarzkopf to a $5 million world rights deal for his life story, many people openly questioned whether a year to 18 months after the Persian Gulf war, the American public would turn its notoriously fleeting attention span back to the victorious general.
 
'People Are Looking for Heroes'
 After all, remainder tables are strewn with the failed memoirs of celebrities and politicians who fell out of the public eye or favor after securing lucrative publishing contracts. Add a recession to the picture and a $25 price tag to the book, and booksellers, other publishers and even some people within Bantam wondered whether the book could earn back the advance even if it became a best seller. 
 The only people second-guessing the deal now are those publishers who wish they had made a more generous offer to the general so that they could now be gloating over the book's 14 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, with many of them, like this past Sunday, in the enviable No. 2 slot.
"General Schwarzkopf is a genuine hero, and people are looking for heroes these days," said Bob Wietrak, director of merchandising for Barnes & Noble Bookstores Inc., explaining what he called the book's "phenomenal performance."
Mr. Wietrak would not disclose the chain's orders for the book, but he said he expected that it would remain a strong seller through Father's Day and that the company would return only 7 or 8 percent of the books ordered. As a benchmark, he noted that Barnes & Noble considered 15 percent returns on a major nonfiction book to be excellent.
Other chain stores, independent booksellers and distributors said they expected returns in the 7 to 12 percent range, and all agreed that such numbers qualified the book as one of the "cleanest sales" of the year, meaning that nearly all the books printed and ordered would actually end up sold.
 
'Outperformed Expectations'
 Bantam had an initial printing of 650,000 copies and has so far gone back to press 13 times for a total of 1,180,000 books.
If return estimates by Mr. Wietrak and others are an accurate guide, executives at Bantam can assume that the book has already sold more than a million copies, making it the second most successful Bantam hardcover ever, behind only "Iacocca," which sold 2.6 million copies in its hardback edition.
"It has outperformed our customers' expectations and our own," Irwyn Applebaum, president and publisher of Bantam, said of the book, which was written with Peter Petre.
Booksellers and Bantam executives credited the general's personal promotion of the book, with numerous and lengthy book signings and a busy schedule of interviews with varied news and entertainment outlets, as a major factor in the book's success.
Mr. Applebaum headed Pocket Books when the book was being auctioned, and his company, a division of Simon & Schuster, did not bid on it. "Clearly we did not think it had the merits to be this competitive, " he said.
Now, people inside and outside Bantam think that the book has a strong chance of earning back its advance even before its paperback edition goes on sale, which is expected sometime this fall. Bantam earned back more than $2 million in subsidiary rights sales, people involved in the project said, including domestic first serialization in Newsweek, club rights to the Book-of-the-Month Club and foreign translations.
"In retrospect it was a very smart buy," said Barry Lippman, president of the adult trade division of Macmillan, which bid $1.2 million for the book.

 BODY:
In terms of seniority on the club scene, HOWARD STEIN, who owns Au Bar, considers himself and his establishment on East 58th Street positively ancient. That is why he is planning a big party for Au Bar's fifth anniversary next Monday.
"Nightclubs don't usually last that long -- success is about a year and a half -- so in my mind, Au Bar will be 35 and I will be 350 years old," Mr. Stein, who is 50, said the other day. 
 To mark the occasion, he has invited the club's 1,000 cardholders to a cocktail party, buffet dinner and performance by the Persuasions, an a capella singing group. "We will dance all night long, which is what we usually do," he said.
The secret of Au Bar's longevity in a fickle world? "We have a large portion of non-Americans, which is how we survived the recession: mainly French and Italian and right now an amazing number of Brazilians and Russians," Mr. Stein said.

Now: Bet While You Booze

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: BETHESDA, Md.

 BODY:
A pernicious philosophy of something-for-nothing is sweepstaking the country. Politicians push state-sponsored gambling to bilk the poor while publishers back lotteries to deceive the public.
Here in the Democratic-dominated state of Maryland, Gov. William ("Bet While You Booze") Schaefer has been visiting restaurants with bars to tout his solution to budget-balancing: keno, a numbers game under state auspices that entices patrons to stare at a television screen above the bar and to try their luck. 
 The Governor is putting the power and prestige of his office behind the exploitation of a human weakness. It raises money for worthy purposes, he maintains, firmly placing the ends before the means -- and besides, people gamble anyway.
On that theory, why not State of Maryland Official Brothels? People patronize prostitutes anyway, so why not cut out the middleman and have the state run the enterprise?
Libertarians like me believe that gambling should be decriminalized, regulated and taxed -- but certainly not encouraged by public policy. We don't want to see our governors out there hustling customers to do what is manifestly against their economic interests. Gubernatorial shilling is not just demeaning but wrong.
Fortunately for Marylanders, no Indian reservations are in the state. The Supreme Court has held that when a state sponsors gambling, it cannot deny the lucrative activity to tribes within its borders. As a result, American Indian leaders have joined up with corporate hustlers to erect glitzy casinos on reservations. Like Governor Schaefer, they insist that the purported end (lifting Native Americans out of poverty) justifies the sleazy means (preying on the suckers of other cultures while corrupting their own).
When the likelihood of corruption was broached in this space a year ago, American Indian leaders and their partners' lawyers complained. Now we have a report from the inspector general of the Interior Department charging that "over $12 million may have been diverted from tribes to operators and suppliers, principally because of theft and mismanagement . . ."
Interior shyly names no names. But to get an idea of the profit potential in the industry spawned by state-sponsored gambling, flip though the 1992 annual report of Grand Casinos Inc. The promoter, Lyle Berman of Minneapolis, boasts that two million visitors have come to the home of the Ojibwe Indians, where 1,400 video slot machines now grace Minnesota's premium fishing lake. (Grand Casinos' audit committee, its S.E.C. form 10-K dutifully notes, did not meet last year.)
Why are the holy Savonarolas not up in arms against the enshrinement of something-for-nothing by so many state legislatures? Because many publishers are eager participants in the sweepstakes frenzy.
If you have not received a bulky envelope announcing that you are a "finalist" in the Publishers Clearing House $10 million sweepstakes, you must be demographically dead. Breathless TV spots hype the promotion; local media outlets cover the winners (never the millions of losers) as news.
Although the notice that "no purchase is necessary to enter and win" appears on the back of one of the so-called certificates, that Federal requirement is cunningly circumvented by the headline "An Order Gets You Express Entry." The dodge: "If your entry comes in on time with at least one Order Coupon on it, we'll automatically enter you in every contest. . . ."
The clear implication: If you buy a magazine, your contest entry -- your impossible dream -- gets preferential treatment. And if you don't buy, the promoters warn, you may not get another lottery entry.
Such august publications as Time, Newsweek, U.S. News, Forbes, Reader's Digest and Golf Digest sell subscriptions this way. No editor recoils publicly in distaste.
Why? Because too many state governors and powerful publishers go along. Unless curbed by public revulsion, the insidious propagation of something-for-nothing will explode into its next phase: keno on a sub-notebook computer, a state-sponsored casino in your coat pocket, a slot machine in your children's jeans.
The truth is that nothing is for nothing. Hard work, talent, merit will win you something. Reliance on luck, playing the sucker, will make you a loser all your life.

HEADLINE: New York State Must Free Appropriated Funds

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York continues to pit motorist against straphanger in the battle for transportation dollars, there are $1.7 billion in state funds sitting on the desks of state officials that should be put to work repairing roads, bridges, mass transit and other public works infrastructure. 
 New York State government can help jump-start economic recovery in the construction industry with a fast-track plan for those stalled capital projects. That's why Assembly Republicans have proposed a way to expedite approval for these capital projects to get the money out of state agencies in time for the beginning of the 1993 construction season.
Our proposal cites $1.77 billion in capital projects for which funds have already been appropriated by the Legislature, but remain unspent by the Cuomo administration.
While there may be legitimate reasons for delays in various projects, every effort should be made to speed up the approval process to provide jobs for New York's construction industry and improved infrastructure for all New Yorkers.
An immediate investment in infrastructure should be part of New York State's economic recovery plan. Governor Cuomo doesn't need to beg for higher taxes, borrow with new bond issues or steal from one region to pay another. He just needs to spend the money that is already budgeted for capital projects. And he needs to do it fast.

Some Rates Feel a New Push Higher

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Longer-term interest rates are coming under upward pressure again as investors and traders seem to be focusing on the uncertainity over the coming change in Administrations and the Democrats' taking control of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
But shorter-term interest rates could hold steady for now if the news in Friday's employment data -- that economic growth is still very slow -- continues. 
 For long-term interest rates, said Robert V. DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers, "There are two main hurdles ahead, resolving the budget policy and getting some further evidence that inflation remains low as the expansion takes hold." But Mr. DiClemente is still forecasting that the 30-year bond yield will resume a decline later in the year after these hurdles are cleared.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities Inc., agrees that longer yields should head back up. But unlike Mr. DiClemente he thinks concerns about the new Administration and inflation will prevent a recovery in bond yields later in the year.
 
'Very Cautious Approach'
 "Given that the economy is a little stronger, given a new President and given a Democratic Congress, it is hard to expect inflationary expectations to go down anytime soon," he said. "So I think the bond market will be adopting a very cautious approach."
Uncertainty about the future, however, should have less impact on shorter-term interest rates, which are much more affected now by whether the Federal Reserve Board is going to raise interest rates. And for many traders, Friday's report showing sluggish job growth may have pushed that date a little further into the future.
The reminders of the coming uncertainty came last week in several forms. One was the Bush Administration's last budget, released Wednesday. The policies proposed for the fiscal year 1994, which begins Oct. 1, were ignored. But the deficit numbers could not be. By fiscal year 1997, which starts the October before the 1996 Presidential election, the forecast is for a deficit somewhere between $300 billion and $400 billion, depending on the spending assumptions.
Then on Thursday came a reminder of the possibility of a stronger-than-expected economy in the sharp drop in initial jobless claims, which fell by 40,000 in the last week of December, to 291,000, the lowest level since April 1989.
 
Many Traders Startled
 These reports, coming with the actual change of Administrations so close, startled many investors and traders, who had become unusually positive since the election and had appeared to ignore the fears that a Democratic President would normally engender. They had come to believe that Mr. Clinton would pay attention to reducing the deficit. Now they knew it would be more difficult for him to do that, and he himself appeared to be backing away from a promise to cut the deficit in half by fiscal year 1997.
They had also come to believe that moderate economic growth was good because it would mean that Mr. Clinton would rein in his plans to stimulate the economy with new Government spending and tax cuts.
But the stronger-than-expected unemployment numbers raised fears among traders that the economy was moving a little too fast, given the fact that Mr. Clinton would not abandon all his plans for economic stimulus. So inflation, although down to 3 percent last year, may become a concern as traders form their expectations for the future.
But there was some relief from all the Thursday panic, when prices of bonds and stocks fell sharply across the board, in the employment data on Friday, which showed nonfarm payroll jobs increasing by only 64,000 in December. That was less than many estimates and a sign that the economy was growing at a slower pace than Thursday's jobless claims report had made people think.
"There has been some improvement recently but the word strong does not apply," said Mr. Fine.
 
Highest Average Since '66
 In addition, two behind-the-headline numbers reported on Friday gave additional comfort to short-term investors and traders. One figure was hours worked in manufacturing. In December, the average manufacturing week reached 41.3 hours. Outside of a week last May, this was the highest average since 1966, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
What this shows, economists say, is that employers would rather work current employees longer hours and overtime than hire new employees. This is one of the reasons job growth has been so sluggish. But it is also why many economists argue that the recovery will be moderate at best.
Since the formal end of the recession in March 1991, nonfarm payroll jobs have increased by only 367,000. Since the unemployment low point in January 1992, nonfarm jobs are up only 611,000, far below the rate of increase in past recoveries.
The second figure is for "other job losses," a category that measures permanent layoffs. This number has been much higher in this recovery than in previous ones, which is a reflection of the vast number of jobs cut as companies have gone through restructurings to make them more competitive and to get rid of the debt accumulated in the 1980's.
In December, this number had just fallen to 3.9 million from a peak of 4.3 million in June and 4.2 million in October. While the number is declining, it is coming down only slowly. And analysts expect that the corporate layoffs and reorganizations -- like those announced by Kodak and United Airlines last week -- will continue to hold back the economy.
 
Data Offer Confirmation
 In the market, these data seemed to confirm again that the Federal Reserve would not be forced by a spirited economy to tighten monetary policy by raising short-term interest rates anytime soon. Although many forecasts for this year had predicted no Fed tightening until late in the year, many bond traders apparently were not yet convinced.
The change in expectation about Fed policy gave a boost to Treasury securities with shorter maturities. On Friday, the discount rates on Treasury bills jumped enough to equal or surpass their losses in Thursday's rout. The price of the two-year note was up 9/32 to yield 4.47 percent after the price fell 6/32 Thursday with the yield rising to 4.61 percent. The three-year note rose 10/32 to yield 4.96 percent, compared to a 9/32 fall to yield 5.08 percent the day before.
But the turnaround ended there. The price of the five-year note was up 11/32 to yield 5.96 percent but it had fallen 15/32 on Thursday. The price of the 10-year note managed to inch up only 3/32 to yield 6.72 percent after plunging 25/32 the day before. And the price of the 30-year bond, which dropped a point and 4/32 on Thursday fell another 7/32 Friday to push the yield back up to 7.46 percent, where it last was in mid-December as rates were falling to the 7.39 percent level at the end of the year.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
A Fashion Neophyte Steps in at British Vogue

BYLINE: By ALEX WITCHEL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
She has written for Tina Brown, been employed by Anna Wintour's stepmother and succeeded Elizabeth Tilberis as the editor of British Vogue. Can the top of an American masthead be far behind?
Alexandra Schulman got the job even though she has no fashion background. She was previously editor of British GQ, having gone there from Vogue where she was Ms. Tilberis's features editor. Now that she's back, British Vogue, which celebrated its 75th anniversary last year, seems to be thriving. 
 Stephen Quinn, its publishing director, says that since Ms. Schulman's first issue in June, circulation has risen more than 3 percent, to 186,000 from 180,000. Mr. Quinn says that 143,000 issues are sold in Britain and 43,000 are sold internationally, giving it the largest international circulation of any Vogue. "The essence of Vogue's authority here is as the fashion leader," he says, "though it has a bigger curiosity than just that of the fashion world."
 
A Lucrative Position
 The editorship of British Vogue is a job that led both of Ms. Schulman's predecessors to New York as winners of the publishing world's equivalent of the Lotto jackpot. When Ms. Tilberis became editor of Harper's Bazaar, her salary was estimated at $1.25 million, including a Manhattan townhouse and garden and private school tuition. When Ms. Wintour, who was Ms. Tilberis's predecessor, became editor of American Vogue, she was said to have had an equal compensation package, plus a clothing allowance rumored to be tens of thousands of dollars a year.
So, in what is becoming a grand tradition of British women dictating American fashion, Ms. Schulman, who is 35, has, as one slightly sour editor in New York puts it, "taken her place on the conveyor belt." Whether she will stay on it, however, remains to be seen. No one in New York has offered her a job -- yet.
"It's a new game, really, all these British people going to New York," Ms. Schulman says in her sparely decorated office, with clocks on the wall for London, Paris and New York. She is smart, serious and unsmiling. This is not a boss for anyone looking for a long, lazy lunch hour.
"The money there is certainly different," she continues. "I'll be interested to see how it all works out, who will survive, who won't. Everyone's looking for a chance to change their life. I changed mine when I came here."
 
'More Intellectual Range'
 That change, Mr. Quinn says, can only help the magazine. "Alex's contacts in literary society are pretty impressive and we like that," he says. "The incredibly upwardly mobile society of the 80's has come to a lurch in the road and we don't want an obsessive focus on designer this or that. We wanted more intellectual range, which we had slightly jettisoned and everything was just fashion, fashion, fashion. Vogue always had honored great painters, authors, film directors, but that sensibility had somehow diminished. Alex has the editing flair to bring that back without losing the sense of focus or direction in fashion."
Indeed, in 1992, he adds, 1,250 pages of advertising were sold for British Vogue, which is owned by Conde Nast. "That is in a recession year," he notes, "while its rivals -- Elle, Marie Claire, Harpers and Queen -- sold 1,000 pages or less. And we charge much higher rates than they do. So, we beat the pants off the competition, as you might say in the States."
The circulation is tiny compared with American Vogue's 1.3 million. But Mr. Quinn says that unlike the States where 50 to 70 percent of most magazines are sold by subscription, "the newsstand here is where the action is. Ninety percent of our sales are newsstand, which is a genuine response to the magazine, going back to the consumer every single month and winning that vote."
Which might explain how British editors have learned to keep their edges sharp. Of the British triumvirate that defines power in New York magazine publishing, Ms. Schulman speaks admiringly of Ms. Wintour and Ms. Tilberis. Though her tone does not change when it comes to Ms. Brown, the formidable former editor of Vanity Fair and the formidable new editor of the New Yorker, Ms. Schulman can sum up her success in two words. "Tina," she says, "is spiritually American."
 
'An Ineffable Glamour'
 Which leaves some American editors wondering where their spirits went wrong as they watch the job market shrink. When Susan Morrison, the new editor of the weekly newspaper The New York Observer, spoke of the publisher at its fifth anniversary party, she said, "I want to toast Arthur Carter for so consistently defying the conventional wisdom, and I'm not referring to his decision to hire an American editor."
In an interview, Ms. Morrison said, "Starting with Tina, there's an important track record. Anna has succeeded in revivifying Vogue. British editors are regarded as a proven formula. There seems to be a faddishness about it, though, something exotic. There is an idea that the British make better editors because they are more in tune with the language. But I think it has something to do with an ineffable glamour Americans associate with anyone or anything foreign."
Another American editor says the British bring the reckless quality of the outsider to their jobs: "They're willing to try anything, offend anyone. They're not on their home turf."
Ms. Schulman says: "English people go to America with the idea that you can get anything done, get what you want. In England you are always rather bound by notions of what you can and cannot do."
So far, at least, Ms. Schulman seems to have eschewed most rules and labels, defining her mission as one of range. "We are covering style and fashion in the broadest sense," she says. "And we don't have an age standard. In December we had Bono and Christy Turlington in leather jeans on our cover. In January it is a beautiful classic car coat. It is very important to do both."
Or she might just be hedging her bets. The British press has made much of the fact that when it comes to personal wardrobe, Ms. Schulman could learn a thing or two from Ms. Tilberis's trademark Chanel, and that she could also become better acquainted with a hairbrush. Her outfit is a short jacket the color of dried blood with a heavy velvet scarf coiled into the collar, long skirt, platform shoes. Her skin is very white, her hair is very black -- and uncombed -- and she is not wearing any makeup. She looks like a graduate student all dressed up to defend her thesis.
 
'A Subject for Chatter'
 "My lack of a traditional fashion background was a subject for chatter the first couple of months," Ms. Schulman acknowledges. "But I've always worked in glossy magazines, so words and pictures are a package with me. I like to featurize fashion, adding a story to give it another dimension, not just showing very expensive clothes floating around that people can't afford. We are very consciously trying to watch the price range and look at fashion in a broader arena, giving the reader options, not just one image."
And how old is the Vogue reader?
She seems caught off guard. She calls out to her assistant, "Do you know the average age of the reader?" The woman looks blank. Ms. Schulman shakes her head. "I don't know. 20-29 is strong. And 40-45 again." What happens in between? "They're all having babies and can't afford magazines," she says shortly, clearly irritated at not knowing the answer.
Raised in a family of journalists, there is not much about the business that escapes her. Milton Schulman, her father, was the drama critic for The Evening Standard before becoming a columnist there. Her brother Jason is an art director at Tatler, her sister, Nicola, a senior writer at Harpers and Queen. Her mother, Drusilla Beyfus, herself a former features editor at Vogue, now works part time as an editor for the Telegraph magazine and writes books.
Ms. Schulman's career began at Over 21 magazine, which was founded by Audrey Slaughter, who is married to Ms. Wintour's father. She was hired at Tatler in 1982 after writing an article for Tina Brown.
Maybe she's too deeply ensconced in the British magazine world to ever relocate to New York. Certainly, her work to broaden Vogue has only begun.
"Well, what's great about New York," she says, "is you just walk out the front door and there seems to be a story there." She hesitates. "I guess the ideal life would be to spend a certain amount of time in New York and here."
As all the clocks on the wall show that time is up, she walks to her office door. The conversation turns toward the evening and plans to see her boyfriend. She is told that it is the opening night of Kenneth Branagh's "Hamlet" at the Royal Shakespeare Company.
"Oh how lovely," she says brightly. But when she hears that the performance lasts four and a half hours, her tone shifts. And finally, she smiles.
"Even I'm not that broad."

HEADLINE: In Economics, a Subtle Exclusion

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif., Jan. 8

 BODY:
The glass ceiling for women in economics is rather thick. Only a handful are tenured professors at the nation's top-ranked universities. Men dominate the prestigious specialty of theorizing about how economies work. And whenever women ask the American Economic Association to set up a child-care center for the group's annual three-day meeting, their request is turned down.
How to break into the top ranks is a subject of endless discussion among women in the field. Lacking female mentors in the best graduate schools, burdened with child rearing and generally less interested than the men in becoming high priests of theory, the women view themselves as subtly excluded from the mainstream of their profession. 
 "I actually see young women being discouraged by men from trying to become top-ranked theorists," said Elizabeth Hoffman, an economics professor at the University of Arizona's business school and the chairman of the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession. "Their work is never considered by the men to be quite good enough."
Over the last decade, 22 percent of all Ph.D.'s in economics have gone to women. They move easily into entry-level jobs. At the 80 universities with graduate-level economics programs, 20 percent of the assistant professors hired soon after graduate school are women. But women account for only 8 percent of associate professors at these schools, and less than 4 percent of the tenured professors.
Even outside academia, there are barriers for women in economics, said Carol Carson, who heads the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. Though women are hired as often as men for entry-level economics jobs in the Federal Government, studies show that after five years, women receive fewer promotions than men, she said during a discussion of women's issues at the annual meeting here of the American Economic Association, which ended Thursday.
 
Changes Noted
 Now the discussions are moving beyond the economists themselves to a broader national audience. President-elect Bill Clinton's selection of Laura D'Andrea Tyson as the first woman to head the President's Council of Economic Advisers focused attention on how few women there are at the top of the profession. Women in economics, having congregated in what they refer to as the less prestigious people-oriented specialties -- the economics of labor, health care, trade, industrial organization and the like -- are finding these specialties to have gained new stature lately.
These specialties in economics have been pushed toward center stage because the theorists have so far failed to come up with effective solutions to the nation's intractable economic problems.
Ms. Tyson, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, is herself a specialist in trade and industrial issues. Partly for that reason, her appointment drew criticism from some theorists that she lacked the broad grasp of economics that a council head should have.
"What they really were saying is that women are not as good at serious economics as men are," said Sylvia Lane, a professor emeritus in agricultural economics at Berkeley.
 
Government Posts
 After the criticism of Ms. Tyson, Mr. Clinton invited a top-ranked male theorist, Alan Blinder of Princeton University, to work under Ms. Tyson as a council member. Professor Blinder's specialty, macroeconomics, tries to determine how the economy might respond to particular government policies or other economic developments. In the process, theory is translated into complicated mathematical formulas, and computers are used to simulate how the economy might behave. Often in recent years, this process has been inaccurate.
The theorists "are correct to be afraid of people like Laura Tyson," said Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of Congress's Joint Economic Committee. "People like her know how to translate policy into effective action."
Increasingly, professional economists talk of melding theory and applied economics. Zvi Griliches, a Harvard economist and the incoming president of the American Economic Association -- representing mainly academic economists but also some in government and business -- made this point at the meeting here last week. Addressing a luncheon, he argued that some top theorists -- and he named a half-dozen men -- are also engaged in practical economics.
"It is just wrong to say that the major economics departments are not engaged in policy and are not interested," Mr. Griliches said.
Fewer people, in fact, are specializing in pure theory, said Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Ms. Tyson earned her Ph.D. in the early 1970's. And as theory and applied economics merge, women should advance more easily, he said.
 
The Next Generation
 "It is my very strong impression that as you come down the age level, among economists under 35 years old, you cannot tell the men from the women," Mr. Solow said. "You don't find today's crop of women Ph.D.'s clustering in the people-oriented sub-fields nearly to the extent that you did 20 years ago."
The women disagree. The Committee on the Status of Women surveyed 30 universities that have what the American Economic Association considers top-ranked graduate programs in economics. Of 572 tenured professors, 19 are women. Most of those, like Ms. Tyson, are not theorists.
The men do not dispute any of the figures. "Women have made gains thus far mostly at the entry level," said C. Elton Hinshaw, a Vanderbilt University economist who is also secretary of the association. "One obvious possible explanation is that they are discriminated against."
At the roundtable discussion at the association meeting, which was attended by more than 50 women, Beth Allen, one of the few theorists and mathematicians to have reached tenured professor at a top-ranked school, the University of Minnesota, said: "There is the feeling that everyone is watching for you to make a mistake. And you feel you have to be on university committees to prove yourself, rather than concentrate on theory."
Tenured professors serve on committees that recruit and promote teachers, and Ms. Allen and others at the session argued that until there are more tenured women professors, the men will not move women into the top ranks in great numbers. "We must work to protect our junior colleagues from death by committee," Ms. Allen said.
 
Parental Responsibilities
 Beyond discrimination, women in economics said that rearing children was an obstacle to specializing in theoretical economics, the avenue that often wins full professorships for men by their early 30's. Because of the prestige in being a theorist, the competition is considerable, and the men often put in workaholic hours. What's more, theory involves long periods of concentration to work out complex mathematical equations, and child-rearing makes this difficult, the women said.
It even gets in the way of attending the American Economic Association's three-day annual meeting. Women have periodically asked for child-care support, so they can bring their children and attend the daylong sessions undistracted. The association has turned them down, saying it does not have adequate liability insurance.
Some women at the roundtable suggested that child-rearing should be postponed, until after women gain tenure. Others favored entering graduate school after children are a few years old. Anne O. Krueger of Duke University, a theorist and trade expert, took the latter course. Her only child, a daughter, was 18 months old when Ms. Krueger began graduate work at the University of Wisconsin, earning her Ph.D. in 1958.
But the course she took, more by accident than design, was not really a solution, she said in an interview. "As long as the allocation of labor in the household is going to remain with the woman," she said, "I do not know what the economics profession can do about it."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 15, 1993, Friday

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day on Monday with an article about complaints of discrimination by women in economics misstated the numbers of men and women who are tenured full professors at four universities as well as percentages for the faculty totals of the 30 universities listed. Duke University has 2 women and 22 men who are tenured full professors of economics; the University of California at Berkeley 2 women and 28 men; the University of California at San Diego no women and 16 men; the University of Wisconsin 3 women and 20 men. At the 30 universities listed, 3.5 percent of the tenured economics professors are women.

Cowboys are Quicker on the Draw

 BODY:
Dallas's third touchdown, which gave them a 24-3 lead and put the game all but out of reach, came on a 23-yard run by Emmitt Smith in the third quarter. It came on a draw play that is one of the Cowboys' favorites; that also means they often execute it better than other plays because they enjoy running it. They have used it all season long and in both previous games against Eagles. No doubt Philadelphia had prepared for the play, so the fact that the Cowboys scored on it indicates how well it was executed.
 Basically, it's a cutback draw. The Eagles knew this draw would be run but did not recognize it from this formation, which was a formation Dallas had been using in this game but not running the draw play on. Dallas also says that this is Smith's best play and he makes things happen on it. 
Smith lines up deep in the backfield. He has a tackle-to-tackle, sweeping view. It is his decision to break the play off in any direction he wants, simply by reading the blocks. This time, he got excellent blocking from his linemen and a good block from his fullback, Daryl Johnston, who took care of the middle by stopping the Eagles' linebacker, ???. Once he reached the line of scrimmage he had two holes to choose from -- straight ahead, or off to the left. Smith cut left, his blockers opened a path for him, and he turned the corner and headed into the corner of the end zone.

HEADLINE: MUNICIPAL UNIONS AND NEW YORK CITY REACH PAY ACCORD

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
After months of stalled talks, the Dinkins administration reached a tentative three-year labor settlement yesterday with the largest municipal unions. It gives workers modest wage and benefit increases totaling about 8.25 percent but does not include the productivity concessions City Hall had sought.
The settlement, which is subject to ratification by the unions' rank and file, covers about 180,000 workers in 19 unions, the largest being Local 237 of the teamsters and District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The contracts would be retroactive to January 1992 and for most of the unions would run to March 1995. 
 The tentative agreement marked a new, and considerably more amicable, chapter in Mayor David N. Dinkins's relationship with organized labor, which had been a major force in his election victory in 1989. In the fall of 1990, he granted a 5.8 percent increase in wages and benefits to the city's teachers union, setting the pattern for a costly round of labor settlements that forced him to threaten thousands of layoffs and deep budget cuts before finally moving to cut the labor force through attrition.
 
A Crucial Constituency
 By reaching a contract settlement now, before his re-election campaign begins in earnest, the Mayor appears to have gone a long way toward making peace with a crucial constituency. [News analysis, page B2.]
Despite Mr. Dinkins's firm pledge over the last year that workers would receive no raises unless the unions paid for them through greater efficiency, the city failed to wrest any significant work-rule changes or other concessions from the unions. Instead, the two sides agreed to set up a three-member panel that would continue to negotiate such changes and could arbitrate disputes.
 
A One-Time Cash Bonus
 On the other side, the unions did not receive the kind of wage increases they were seeking since under the agreement salaries are unlikely even to keep up with inflation. Workers would immediately receive a one-time cash bonus of $700, covering the first 18 months of the contract. Beginning in July, they would receive a 2 percent raise, with another 2 percent in July 1994 and a 3 percent raise that December, for the last four months of the contract.
After benefits are added, the total increase over 39 months would be 8.25 percent.
The agreement will cost the city about $321 million this spring and about $428 million in the fiscal year beginning in July, widening the expected shortfall to $2.1 billion in the nearly $30 billion budget for that year. By the end of the contract, the city's total labor costs will have risen by about $1.1 billion a year.
State fiscal monitors questioned whether the city could afford such high recurring costs and said the settlement did little to bring the city's long-term revenues in line with its expenses.
Labor leaders painted the wage settlement as the best they could hope for in a tough economic times, saying they did not believe the city had money for greater wage raises. "When you get all there is, you've done your job," said Barry Feinstein, the president of the teamsters local. "There is nothing left to take."
 
Retreat Acknowledged
 Mayor Dinkins acknowledged that he had retreated from his original pledge to pay for wage increases with concessions, but he added that he was confident that the new panel would yield greater productivity from city workers.
"I'm satisfied that while this is a fair agreement to labor, it is as good an agreement as management could achieve in the circumstances," he said.
Negotiators said this year's mayoral election campaign created extra pressure on the administration to settle. In addition, the teachers union's current contract is in arbitration before a state panel, and officials feared that the settlement, expected soon, could skew negotiations with other unions.
The administration also wanted to reach an accord before releasing its preliminary budget later this month.
 
Lump-Sum Payment
 Besides the wage increases, the union members would receive a one-time lump-sum payment for fringe benefits of $125 per employee in the next fiscal year and a $100 per worker increase in benefits in each of the last two years of the contract. The agreement also establishes a $20 million fund to be used to address problems the city and the unions have in recruiting and retaining professional and technical workers.
The city also agreed to help labor leaders lobby in Albany for changes in state pension rules that would allow employees more flexibility in choosing their pension plans.
Although labor leaders said they had made no firm commitment to work-rule changes, the settlement spells out that at least six productivity measures will be instituted by next June. A panel including a representative from management, labor and an impartial observer will oversee the initiatives and will be able to settle any disputes, city officials said. A part of the savings will be plowed back into wage increases.
"We think the agreement in effect has an enforcement mechanism as well as a system of accountability," said First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel. "What we're banking on is the fact that the workers will see this as an opportunity to take advantage of the gain-sharing incentive."
 
Avoiding Layoffs
 Both sides repeated their longstanding commitment in the pact to avoid layoffs, and specifically agreed that no layoffs would result from the productivity initiatives, labor and city officials said. The unions have also agreed to relax Civil Service rules to expedite transferring and retraining workers.
"It's not a no-layoff pledge," a senior mayoral adviser said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "We would seek to avoid layoffs and in return for that, the unions would give us relief from certain Civil Service restrictions."
On the issue of increased productivity, labor leaders said that the settlement merely sets up a forum for continuing negotiations and that nothing is etched in stone. "There are no givebacks," said Stanley Hill, president of District Council 37.
Philip R. Michael, the city's Budget Director, said the city had identified ways to pay for the extra costs from the contract for the rest of this fiscal year and the next fiscal year though a combination of bond refinancings, unspent revenues and unanticipated growth in tax revenues.
It was unclear how the city would be able to afford the last year of the contract. Mr. Michael said officials were banking, in part, on an upturn in the economy.
 
Further Spending Cuts
 But Allen J. Proctor, the executive director of the State Financial Control Board, said the city would not be able to afford the contract without resorting to further spending cuts.
Raymond D. Horton, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private watchdog group, questioned the wisdom of granting raises without firm commitments to make the work force more efficient. He said Mr. Dinkins had missed a major opportunity to revamp permanently the way the city does business.
"They put the old pay-raise cart before the productivity horse," he said.
But union leaders said it would be hard to persuade rank-and-file workers to ratify a contract that barely keeps up with inflation when most of them have not had a raise since late 1990.
"This is not going to be a piece of cake," Mr. Feinstein of the teamsters said. "This is not a contract we believe is rich."

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: Confirmation Hearings;
Budget Nominee Testifies Clinton May Set Aside Tax-Cut Pledge

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 -- President-elect Bill Clinton's choice as budget director, Leon E. Panetta, told Congress today that Mr. Clinton's campaign promise to cut the taxes of the middle class was a lower priority than cutting the deficit and increasing spending for new projects the Democrats favor.
In Little Rock, Ark., as part of what may have been a coordinated effort by the Clinton team to back away from this central campaign pledge, two top transition advisers also suggested today that the tax-cut promise was being reconsidered. 
 Top Congressional leaders had said in television interviews on Sunday that they would not hold Mr. Clinton to his proposal to reduce by several hundred dollars a year the taxes of families making less than about $80,000 a year. Such a proposal could cost as much as $10 billion a year in lost revenue.
 
No Final Decisions Yet
 At his confirmation hearing today before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Mr. Panetta rarely took policy proposals beyond points that Mr. Clinton had reached publicly, and Mr. Panetta emphasized that final decisions had not been made about the new Administration's economic plan.
But while he did not retreat entirely from the campaign promise to reduce the taxes of middle-income taxpayers, Mr. Panetta gave the clearest indication to date that it might be set aside, at least for now.
"Our first priority," Mr. Panetta said, "is to develop that deficit reduction plan."
Second in importance, he said, is to "lay out the investment path we want to follow and targeted investments we want to make."
He continued: "And then, I think, dependent on that lies the question of whether or not we can go any further with regards to any kind of further reductions on taxes."
No one on the Senate committee took issue with this, and all the Senators who questioned Mr. Panetta expressed support for confirming him. Mr. Panetta, a California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee, is popular among lawmakers from both parties.
The tax-cut proposal was first made in the early days of the Presidential campaign last winter and spring, when Mr. Clinton emphasized it as being necessary to make the tax system fairer. As the campaign wore on, he gave less emphasis to the proposal but never abandoned it. As recently as his economic conference in Little Rock last month, Mr. Clinton said he still intended to fulfill the promise.
 
'He Was Very Careful'
 In a television interview broadcast tonight by the Public Broadcasting Service, Mr. Clinton was also more explicit than he had been before that he would probably break his campaign promise to cut the budget deficit in half in the next four years. And Mr. Clinton's staff has said in recent days that yet another pledge, to reduce the White House staff by 25 percent, might be difficult to fulfill.
Asked in Little Rock about the prospects for a middle-class tax cut, George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director, said: "We're committed to tax fairness, and President-elect Clinton will continue to work for tax fairness throughout his Administration. But he was very careful not to make read-my-lips pledges."
A top economic policy adviser, Gene Sperling, also took care to leave Mr. Clinton a way out of his tax-cut promise. "When the deficit gets worse, everything gets harder," Mr. Sperling told reporters.
In his testimony at the Senate hearings, Mr. Panetta said Mr. Clinton hoped to announce his economic plan next month and to submit a full-scale budget to Congress in March.
 
'Shooting Straight Up'
 "What we're looking at now is a deficit line that's shooting straight up," Mr. Panetta said. The new Administration's task, he continued, is to "turn that curve back down" so that eventually the deficit is no more than 1 percent of the nation's total production of goods and services. In the fiscal year that ended last September, the deficit was more than 5 percent of that figure.
He said that so far the Clinton economic team had been concentrating on developing a long-term program and had not decided whether to propose a temporary increase in the deficit this year to give the economy a quick stimulus.
In interviews, some advisers suggested that Mr. Clinton was leaning toward such a stimulus, despite recent data showing that the economy was improving. These advisers, who would speak only if they were not identified, said such a plan was needed to make sure the nation did not slide back into recession.
Mr. Panetta said that if a one-year deficit increase was proposed, it would be small, closer to $20 billion for one year than to the $60 billion that some economists had recommended.
 
Clinton Saying Same Thing
 He said the promise Mr. Clinton made during the campaign to reduce the budget deficit by half over the next four years might be unreachable now that new figures show the potential deficits for the 1996 and 1997 fiscal years to be significantly higher than had been projected when Mr. Clinton first set the goal.
Mr. Clinton himself made that point in the interview with PBS. He said that he still planned to reduce the deficit by as much money as ever -- about $145 billion by the last year of his term -- but that the sum might not be enough to cut the deficit in half. He and his advisers now think that without policy changes, the deficit, now about $300 billion, could be as high as $400 billion by 1996 or 1997.
Mr. Clinton also stressed in the interview the importance of controlling medical costs, and today he met in Little Rock with his top health-policy advisers.
 
Conflict With Federal Reserve
 In his Congressional testimony, Mr. Panetta said he favored a deficit-reduction ratio of about $2 in spending cuts for each $1 of tax increases. When programs are being examined for possible spending cuts, he said, "everything is on the table," presumably including programs once considered politically untouchable like Social Security, although he did not mention it specifically. He said he hoped a higher gasoline tax would not be necessary, but he did not rule it out.
Mr. Panetta cautioned that even the most rigorous effort to cut the deficit would be futile if the Federal Reserve, which controls interest rates, did not adopt a policy allowing strong growth in the economy.
Alan M. Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and other officials have suggested recently that they might favor a tight-money policy that many economists and politicians say could be a drag on the economy.
The only real control the White House has over the Federal Reserve is political pressure, and Mr. Panetta seemed to be applying that today. "If for any reason the Federal Reserve bails out on us," he said, "it's going to be very tough then to try to meet the targets that we've established."
Over the years, Mr. Panetta has been a more vigorous advocate of deficit reduction than Mr. Clinton and most other Democrats. While he did not even remotely take issue with the President-elect today, he displayed his familiar zeal for budget cutting. "We need to confront these deficits," he declared, "to make the tough choices and be prepared for some sacrifice, in order to make our economy more productive and provide greater opportunity for our children tomorrow."

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: Social Scene;
A Highly Sensitive Post Is Filled by the Clintons

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
After weeks of discussion and deliberation and the selection of a Secretary of State and Attorney General, the Clintons have done something really important to Washington's high and mighty: They picked a White House social secretary.
Ann Stock, the vice president of public relations for Bloomingdale's, who divides her time between Washington and the New York department store, is Hillary Clinton's choice for a job that to some is as important as the White House chief of staff and, in its own way, wields almost as much power.
Nicki Hedrick, director of media relations at Bloomingdale's, confirmed today that Mrs. Stock had resigned to take the White House job, where she will hold sway over who gets invited to Presidential functions. Mrs. Clinton's office refused to comment on the appointment.
"If you care about going to the White House it's a very powerful job," said Carolyn Peachey, president of Campbell, Peachey & Associates, a public relations firm.
 
Intense Competition
 After 12 years in a city where the most sought-after invitation is to a White House dinner, there are a lot of Democrats clamoring to get on the list.
Competition for the social secretary's position was intense. "It always has been," said Sheila Tate, who was press secretary to Nancy Reagan and is now president of Powell Tate, a public relations firm. "The job has great cachet."
Mrs. Stock, a former deputy press secretary to Vice President Walter F. Mondale, was chosen from a list that included Ms. Peachey, who did not want to be considered; Susan O'Neill, daughter of the former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr.; Liz Stevens, wife of the film director George Stevens, and Alma Viator, a vice president of the National Theater.
A number of people prominent in Georgetown's social circle were surprised by the choice, and telephone calls today soliciting their responses often began with comments like the one from Polly Kraft, wife of the lawyer and former White House counsel Lloyd Cutler: "Do I know her?"
 
She Knows Washington
 Mrs. Stock may not be a household name to the Georgetown crowd, but she has long experience in the capital. "It's good that no Georgetown ladies know her," said Ms. Tate. "She's fresh and unspoiled. She's a hard worker and she certainly knows Washington."
Everyone agrees that the White House social secretary should know Washington so as to navigate the treacherous political waters and the rocky protocol shores.
"It's very important," said Muffie Brandon, now director of corporate programming for the Ford Motor Company and social secretary to Nancy Reagan from 1980 to 1983. "The intricacies of this city, the nuances of political life and of protocol are not things you can learn on the job."
Mrs. Stock is not new to politics or to Washington. Besides working for Mr. Mondale, she volunteered for the Capital Children's Museum and helped raise the money to open it.
 
Other Qualifications
 Those who know Mrs. Stock describe her as energetic, enthusiastic and creative, highly organized and very professional, qualities that are important in such a sensitive job.
"There are toes that don't need to be stepped on," said Ms. Tate. "You need to genuflect to certain people. It's important that she knows the traps and avoids needlessly offending people, just in terms of the Hill and the traditions and all the protocol."
Mrs. Stock, who is 46 and lives in nearby Alexandria, Va., graduated from Purdue University, where she majored in elementary education. She has been married to Stuart Stock, a partner at Covington & Burling, for 22 years. They have a 13-year-old son, Chase, who is a student at the Potomac School in McLean, Va.
She is a member of the Overseas Economic Fund's Women in Business Committee and founded the Washington Woman Roundtable, a group of 1,000 female executives who meet every three months to network. She was founder of Washington's "Race for the Cure" against breast cancer, and helped to organize the same event in New York City.
Mrs. Stock could not be reached for comment. She was on her way back to New York from Little Rock, Ark.

HEADLINE: Anse a Galets Journal;
Haitians' Hope for Jan. 20: A Fair Wind for Florida

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANSE A GALETS, Haiti, Jan. 7

 BODY:
At the simple concrete wharf that is the only port of La Gonave, a desolate, rock-ribbed island off Haiti, two soldiers shadowed by a clutch of onlookers converged on a visitor to ask if he, like most of the foreigners who infrequently venture here, had come in search of boat people.
Even before the visitor could reply, a man shouted from the crowd, "We are all leaving, and that much is certain!" His words drew approving cheers, and a kind of answer to a question that has been hanging in the air since President-elect Bill Clinton promised to end the Bush Administration's practice of summarily returning Haitians intercepted at sea. 
 For decades La Gonave has slumbered in neglect and abject misery, its economic vibrancy a faint echo even compared with that of the rest of Haiti, which is the hemisphere's poorest country. But since waves of desperate Haitians began fleeing for the United States after a violent military coup in September 1991, the building of ships here and their launching for the long-odds journey to South Florida have given a rare breath of life to this horse-and-donkey economy.
At first approach, Lorphene Joseph, a stocky 40-year-old who was rushing to complete a cavernous 40-foot sailboat, the seventh such vessel he said he had built, said he did not know how it would be used. After a long chat, though, he offered a kind of confession.
"I can't stop building these boats because there is no hope for our people," he said. "They are forced to look for a better life somewhere else."
 
Waiting for a Savior
 With dozens of gaily painted wooden boats ready for launching and many more nearing completion, others on this barren island are not so coy, saying they are posed for a signal from Washington that will mean either that the United States will welcome Haitians with open arms or will throw itself into the rebuilding of their country and the restoration of their overthrown President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Since campaign statements promising a dramatic change from President Bush's approach to this country's refugee crisis, the Clinton team has sought to dampen expectations like these, warning in statements carried repeatedly on radio broadcasts here that the United States' doors were not suddenly being thrust open, while promising to work for Father Aristide's return.
But on La Gonave, as in much of Haiti, people continue to understand such things in their own fashion, and for many that means clinging to the belief that one way or another the new American President will be their savior.
"Bill Clinton is a democrat and Aristide is a democrat, so your President can bring our President back," said Robert Jean-Louis, a 24-year-old student who vowed to attempt a second trip to the United States if Mr. Clinton's inauguration was not accompanied by such news. "If I see things aren't changing, that same evening I'll be getting on a boat again. Ninety percent of the people here will tell you the same thing."
Indeed, although it is impossible to say how many of them will set out to sea on or shortly after Mr. Clinton's inauguration on Jan. 20, almost everywhere people agreed to speak to a visitor here, from the rock-strewn streets of the only sizable town, Anse-a-Galets, to the mangrove-shielded shallows where final coats of paint were being applied to curving hulls, they vowed to reach the United States.
[The Coast Guard returned 226 Haitians on Monday and investigated reports that a wooden boat carrying nearly 400 went down off the Bahamas in December, The Associated Press reported from Port-au-Prince. Cuba has told the Coast Guard that it rescued 8 Haitians from the boat but that 396 had apparently been aboard.]
 
Aristide the Key
 "The only news that could interest me is whether they send our President back," said Jean Andre, 22, who was asked if he had followed reports of the Clinton Administration's plans to avert a renewed surge of Haitian boat people. "If they can't bring us Aristide, the moment Guantanamo opens I'll be on the first boat I can climb aboard."
Mr. Clinton's aides have suggested in recent days that they will reopen the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to screen Haitian boat people. Those who are determined to have genuine political reasons for fleeing their country, they say, could be taken to the United States or housed temporarily at the base while a settlement of the country's crisis is sought. Those determined to be fleeing primarily for economic reasons would be returned to Haiti.
Calypso Mavis, a wiry entrepreneur who has grown rich in the last year by ferrying Haitians hoping to flee the country from the mainland to La Gonave, said, "All this time they have been unable to settle our crisis people have only gotten more desperate."
In addition to his wooden yawl used last year for the slow passage, Mr. Mavis now owns a sleek and powerful outboard, and his thick gold watch and gold caps on his teeth attest to his recent success.
"Aristide must come back, right now, because otherwise we will be eating each other soon," Mr. Mavis warned. "Either that, or we all end up in Guantanamo."

HEADLINE: States Lose Credit-Card Fee Battle

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Rejecting an appeal by Massachusetts and 37 other states, the Supreme Court let stand today a ruling forbidding states to place limits on fees that state-chartered banks charge their credit-card holders.
Without comment, the Court declined to review a Federal appeals court ruling that state regulation of bank credit-card fees was pre-empted by a 1980 Federal law. 
 That ruling, issued last August by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston, was a victory for the Delaware-chartered Greenwood Trust Company, which issues the Discover credit card to customers around the country. Greenwood does not charge an annual fee for the card, but does charge a $10 late fee when a monthly payment has not been made by 20 days past the due date. After the Massachusetts Attorney General told Greenwood that the fee violated a state law banning all such charges, the bank went to Federal court seeking a declaration that the state ban was pre-empted.
 
'Exporting' Loan Rates
 The basis for the bank's winning argument was the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980. Congress enacted this law to help state-chartered banks escape the interest-rate ceilings that states were beginning to impose. The law explicitly pre-empts state laws "with respect to interest rates," permitting banks to "export" the loan rate ceilings of their home states.
While the law does not refer to late charges or other fees, the First Circuit concluded that it was logical to include late charges within the scope of the Federal pre-emption. The phrase "interest rates" was not limited to the numerical rate, the appeals court said, and should be interpreted as also including other loan-related charges.
Massachusetts and five other states -- Colorado, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and Vermont -- prohibit late charges. Twenty-four other states, including Connecticut, impose percentage or dollar limits on the charges. New York has no limits.
 
State's Argument
 In its Supreme Court appeal, Massachusetts v. Greenwood Trust, No. 92-794, the state argued that the First Circuit went further than Congress intended when it passed the 1980 law, and threatened to disturb the states' role in regulating credit.
The state said that while the First Circuit's opinion referred only to late charges, the court's analysis also appeared to bar state regulation of other charges, like those for duplicate statements, replacement cards or as penalties for exceeding credit limits.
The only states affected by the First Circuit's ruling are the four within that circuit: Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. No other Federal appeals court has yet addressed the question. If a conflict does develop among the lower courts, the Justices may feel obliged to resolve the question.
 
U.S. Appeal Denied
 In another ruling, the Court refused without comment to hear an appeal by the Federal Government on whether it could continue to enforce a standard in Federal construction contracts requiring contractors to correct any nonconforming work regardless of the cost.
Courts typically interpret private contracts according to a doctrine known as "economic waste," under which strict compliance to the contract terms is not required as long as the nonconforming product meets or exceeds the needs of the project and the cost of replacement was disproportionate to any benefit.
But the Federal Government insisted on strict compliance, until a ruling last May by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit applied the economic waste doctrine to a Federal contract. The dispute involved a sealant used in a dam being constructed near Aberdeen, Miss., at a cost of less than $6,000.
The Army Corps determined that the sealant did not meet the contract specifications and insisted that it be replaced. The task cost the contractor, the Granite Construction Company, at least $400,000. Granite then sought compensation, and sued when the Government denied its claim. Granite won in the appeals court.
In its appeal -- the United States v. Granite Construction, No. 92-545 -- the Government warned that the court's approach threatened the "integrity of the public bidding system."
 
Ruling on Inventor
 In another ruling, the Court turned down without comment an appeal by an inventor, Jerome H. Lemelson, who had sued the toy maker Mattel Inc. over the patent for a popular Mattel toy, Hot Wheels.
Mr. Lemelson, a frequent plaintiff in patent infringement suits, had earlier persuaded a jury that Mattel had infringed a patent he owned on a flexible toy track. The jury awarded Mr. Lemelson $75 million in damages, but the Federal Circuit, in a ruling last June, set aside the award on the ground that "no reasonable jury" could have found infringement under the circumstances. Mr. Lemelson's Supreme Court appeal was Lemelson v. Mattel, No. 92-818.

HEADLINE: Making Peace Before the Election

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
By reaching a contract that provides modest raises for most of New York City's union workers before his re-election campaign begins in earnest, Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday went a long way toward solving a big political headache and making peace with a crucial constituency.
But he did so by breaking his longstanding pledge to grant raises only in exchange for increased productivity by workers, and with that Mr. Dinkins may have also bought himself endless fiscal headaches in the coming months and years, even if he wins a second term. 
 "The significance of this contract isn't whether or not it's good or bad," said Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the State Financial Control Board, which has overseen the city's books since the fiscal crisis of the 70's. "It is reasonable by any standard. But the city's finances are structurally out of whack, and the large and unfunded costs of even a reasonable wage settlement underscores the urgency of significantly increased productivity and restructuring if the city is to avoid even sharper service cuts than are already needed."
 
Changing Fortunes
 It is a measure of both the Mayor's changing fortunes, and his city's, that the debate should be so framed. Ten months into his term, in the fall of 1990, Mr. Dinkins was roundly excoriated for a granting 5.8 percent increase in wages and benefits to teachers, which fiscal watchdogs said he could not afford, and then threatening thousands of layoffs and dire cuts in municipal services.
After that Mr. Dinkins vowed a much different approach. So this year's conservative raise, averaging well below the 3.5 percent annual inflation rate, is not enough to draw the watchdogs' praise. That is because the Mayor had promised for months that the city would grant no wage increases at all through June of 1994, except in exchange for improvements in workers' efficiency, in an effort to close gaps between expected revenues and expenditures that the city's own forecasts predict will grow steadily in the coming years.
By that standard, the Mayor reneged. Yesterday's settlement calls for a raise of 2 percent for the fiscal year that starts this July, and increases that would total an 8.25 percent increase in wages and benefits by March, 1995. There was a promise by management and labor to form a committee to agree on productivity improvements, or to submit to the binding rulings of a joint panel, but no specific savings were claimed.
 
Costs Are Clear
 Meantime, the costs are already all too clear: In the coming fiscal year, if all unions get similar raises, the city will have to spend $428 million on raises -- for which it had budgeted no money at all. That would increase its expected budget gap to well over $2 billion. City officials contend they will be able to bear the higher costs mostly through anticipated growth in tax yields because of an improving economy, and not resort to deeper spending cuts -- a proposition the fiscal watchdogs questioned. The Mayor's flexibility is limited by his previous pledges to freeze property tax rates, the city's main revenue source, for the next three years.
By the spring of 1996, the new contract will be costing the city an extra $1 billion a year, more than twice the amount the city had budgeted for raises in that period, and enough to increase the city's projected budget gap for that year from $2.6 billion to well over $3 billion.
Of course, the city almost always grants larger raises than it acknowledges it is willing to do, and Mr. Dinkins had compelling reasons to settle the contracts. He wanted to reach agreement with the bulk of city workers before beginning nonbinding arbitration with the city's teachers' union tomorrow, so that any settlement with the teachers, who are pressing for higher wages than their fellow workers, would not set the pattern for the rest. It was settling with the teachers first in the last round of bargaining that helped get Mr. Dinkins in trouble.
Mr. Dinkins called the settlement a "win-win" proposition, that would mean "a better-trained, more productive and better-paid work force."
Understandably, his rivals saw it differently. Victoria Streitfeld, chief of staff to City Council President Andrew J. Stein, who has vowed to challenge Mr. Dinkins in the Democratic primary, said, "Leadership is more than just writing a check."
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Mayor's Republican challenger, said, "This is even more of a cave-in than I expected."
But Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, the largest city union and one of Mr. Dinkins's major backers in his last race, sounded a different note. Asked if this would make union members happy in August and September, when the mayoral primary will be in full swing, Mr. Hill just smiled broadly and said, "What's happening in August and September?"

HEADLINE: Wiring Into the Future;
The High Stakes of Telecommunications

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
Fearful that the enemy will gain superiority, one side sinks vast amounts of money into building sophisticated weapons. Its adversary, now frightened that it may be vulnerable, agonizes over whether to match the investment or up the ante.
In this race, the contestants are New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. The war is over jobs. The weapons systems are advanced telecommunications networks capable of delivering an array of high-tech services. And the moves and countermoves all put enormous sums at risk. Yesterday, a Connecticut regulatory agency gave the Southern New England Telephone Company preliminary approval to increase capital spending on its telecommunications network over the next four years to between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. That would be an increase of 50 percent or more. The agency, the Department of Public Utility Control, said it hoped to make a final decision on the investment and deregulation plan -- and the service rates needed to pay for it -- in the late spring. 
 "At a minimum we want to be in the top 12 of the 50 states" in network sophistication, said Clifton A. Leonhardt, the department's chairperson. The higher end of the spending range "might put us in the top 8 by the end of '96," he said.
Last month, New Jersey approved a far-reaching proposal for building a $1.5 billion all-digital fiber-optics network by 2010. And in New York, leaders from business, academia and government are urging the state to follow suit by spending billions to accelerate investment in its telephone network. A task force that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo asked to make a recommendation met for the first time last month.
 
Seeking Intelligence
 "Advanced telecommunications are increasingly being recognized by states as a competitive weapon in economic development and business retention and attraction," said L. C. Mitchell, a telecommunications consultant at Deloitte & Touche. Mr. Mitchell advised New Jersey and is now working with Pennsylvania.
These states, like many others throughout the country, have agonized over how much to gamble on "intelligent" networks capable of simultaneously carrying voice, moving video images and data to and from homes and businesses.
These services, for instance, would make possible high-quality video telephones. They would enable a doctor treating a patient to transmit X-rays or scans to specialists elsewhere for a quick consultation. They would permit consumers to call up movies and tap dozens of libraries and data banks instantly, without leaving home. They would make it easier to work at home. And they would make it much easier and cheaper for businesses of all sizes to do everything from transmitting information to holding video conferences with people in different places.
The ultimate hope is that such a network would enable a state to attract new industries and jobs and improve the quality of life while lowering the cost of services like education and health care.
 
Fear of Falling Behind
 The great fear is that if a state falls behind others, it will not only fail to attract tomorrow's high-tech jobs but lose businesses and jobs it already has. This is an acute concern in the tri-state region, where telecommunications-intensive industries like financial and business services are pillars of the economy.
And the big unknown is just how quickly the envisioned services will arrive. If they come much more slowly than anticipated, a state risks being saddled with an expensive, underutilized telecommunications network that hurts its chances of attracting and retaining companies scared away by the resulting higher rates or taxes.
Regulators and government leaders in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, already high-cost states for companies, are having to confront these issues at a time when jobs and competitiveness are uppermost in their minds. The three were among those hardest hit by the recession, having lost nearly 1.1 million jobs.
With little money to spare, the three states are having no easy time figuring out a way to finance the advanced networks.
 
A Risky Investment?
 Connecticut regulators tried to steer a middle course. They rejected the least expensive and most expensive of four network-modernization proposals and chose the middle two as minimum and maximum goals. Unlike New Jersey, they also said Connecticut should only now commit itself to the first stage of a modernization program by accelerating the adoption of the digital switches, the signaling system and other technology needed for an envisioned advanced network. It did not commit Connecticut to installing a fiber-optic network as New Jersey has.
The reasons for this caution, Mr. Leonhardt said, were unanswered questions about the technology and the attendant financial risks.
"It's good for America that one state, New Jersey, decided to stake a very ambitious ground and have a kind of laboratory for the country, but that doesn't mean it's prudent for Connecticut," he said.
New Jersey's plan calls for a border-to-border network of fiber-optic cable -- the hair-like strands of glass that can carry millions of bits of information a second -- unless a technology that is more cost-efficient emerges.
To help pay for its network, Connecticut regulators said they wanted to give the state's three local phone companies the ability to earn more from monopoly services. They said they would seek to change the law to let local phone companies earn more by placing a cap on prices rather than limiting profits as they have.
But the department also signaled its intent to open portions of the market to competition, including toll calls inside Connecticut, which might be deregulated as early as July 1. It also said it would ask the Legislature to give it powers to open local service to competition. And it called for a gradual end to the practice of subsidizing residential service with business services.
New Jersey's plan, a combination of some deregulation and some rate freezes, is supposedly structured so customers of traditional phone services do not pay the bill. But if the cost of building the network seriously weakens New Jersey Bell, its customers could have to bail it out, analysts and regulators in other states say.
 
Call for Substantial Spending
 In New York, which now has one of the most advanced telecommunications networks, three proposals for modernizing the network are being debated.
A committee of leaders of business education, science, unions, charities, religious groups and the arts financed by the state telephone industry's trade association made the most ambitious proposal. It called for New York Telephone to increase annual capital expenditures, now running at about $1.3 billion, by $650 million to $700 million through the year 2000.
To help pay for the higher investment, it said, the state should continue to open the market to competition, should give the local phone companies more pricing flexibility and should reduce taxes on phone companies.
New York Telephone says slower modernization that would increase annual spending by $250 million to $300 million would keep the state's network competitive with those being built by other states.
But in a draft recommendation circulating for reaction, the staff of the Public Service Commission said New York Telephone's currently planned network investments would suffice and an accelerated program would be too risky.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Corporate Issues Slow a Little

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Activity in the corporate market slowed a little yesterday from the feverish pitch of last week. But based on the reception for a Canadian issue to be sold today, the demand continued.
This was clear when the Province of Ontario began marketing $2.5 billion of 10-year global notes and quickly increased the offering to $3 billion. 
 "The deal grew to fill the demand," said John Madden, the Assistant Deputy Minister of the Treasury of the Province of Ontario.
He also said that the pricing of the deal, based on the marketing that began yesterday, was at the low end of the range of 76 to 79 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the 10-year Treasury note.
The deal, which will be finally priced this morning, will be sold simultaneously around the world.
There were close to $1 billion of new issues sold yesterday, way down from more than $4 billion a day on Wednesday and Thursday. Traders said that prices of corporate issues edged up a little yesterday but that the spread between the yields on corporate bonds and the comparable Treasury securities widened a bit.
 
Credit Outlook
 While the credit outlook for companies and state and local governments is beginning to improve in the United States as the economy recovers, it is worsening in the rest of the world, the Standard & Poor's Corporation said yesterday.
In 1992, credit ratings were downgraded on $122 billion of debt from foreign companies, while only $1.7 billion of debt was upgraded. The downgrading of foreign debt accounted for 32 percent of all of S.& P.'s downgrades, up from 19 percent in 1991. Of the total, $113 billion was debt issued by financial institutions and a large chunk of it, $34 billion, was from Japanese banks. The next biggest group was nine Scandinavian banks, with a total of $32 billion of debt that had its credit ratings lowered.
Looking into this year, Hendrik Kranenburg, executive managing director of Standard & Poor's international finance department, said he expected the downgradings of financial institutions to slow a bit. But he said that the downgradings of corporate debt should accelerate, especially in the electronics, retailing and property sectors.
The picture in the United States last year showed a slowing of the slide for the first time in years.
 
Climbing Higher
 The companies that insure tax-exempt bonds had a sharp jump in their business last year, as the share of municipal bonds that are insured jumped to 34 percent from 30 percent.
The share of the market that is insured has grown from 17.8 percent in 1987 as the insurance companies have been able to convince issuers with medium level credit ratings that insurance lowers the cost of borrowing because buyers are more comfortable when the risk of default is removed.
The question now is how much more of the market can they get.
There are two portions of the market that the issuers are not doing well in. By choice, they ignore the lower rated municipal issues because of the risks involved.
According to David H. Elliott, the president of the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation, the largest insurer with 33 percent of the insurance business, said this unwanted business amounts to about 11 percent of the $233 billion in municipal bonds issued in 1992. Another segment of the market the industry would like to have but is having trouble getting is the top rated issuers, for whom insurance does not appear to be a money saver. This segments amounts to about 30 percent of the market.
This leaves about 25 percent of the market that is still fertile territory.
Robert J. Genader, the executive vice president of the Ambac Indemnity Corporation, the second-largest insurer, with about 31 percent of market, said selling insurance for 34 percent of the municipal business was "very high but I think we can get up to 40 percent in the next two years."
 
Treasury Market
 Prices of Treasury bonds and notes rose in light and dull trading yesterday. The discount rates on Treasury bills also fell.
Traders said the market got a little lift from comments by Representative Leon E. Panetta, Democrat of California and President-elect Bill Clinton's choice for the director of the Office of Management and Budget.
At his confirmation hearing, Mr. Panetta said any package of new spending and tax cuts to stimulate the economy would need to be "very limited." And he indicated that any plan the new Administration might propose would be closer to $20 billion in size than $60 billion.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 6/32 after falling one point and 11/32 in the previous two trading days. the yield dorpped to 7.44 percent, from 7.46 percent Friday.
Following are the results from the Treasury auction yesterday of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Global Merger Value Up 33%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The dollar value of international mergers increased 33 percent in 1992, led by big United States companies expanding overseas through inexpensive acquisitions, according to KPMG Peat Marwick, one of the Big Six accounting concerns.
Cross-border acquisitions rose to $72.6 billion last year from $54.4 billion in 1991. The number of transactions declined to 1,810 in 1992 from 1,960 a year earlier, Peat Marwick said. 
 The biggest of the transactions were the Philip Morris Companies' $1.4 billion acquisition of the Norwegian food company Freia Marabou; the $1.2 billion purchase of Transport del Sur Argentina, a gas distribution company, by a group led by the Enron Corporation, and the Asahi Glass Company's $1 billion acquisition of AFG Industries in the United States.
The total value of mergers in 1992 declined to $216 billion from $225 billion in 1991, according to IDD Information Services. In 1990, the value of mergers was $314 billion, IDD said.
Mergers declined in part because members of the European Community stayed at home, preparing for a single market. In addition, Europe is still in a recession while the American economy is recovering, Peat Marwick said. Purchases of United States companies by European concerns dropped to $4.9 billion in 1992 from $13.6 billion in 1991.

NEW YORK CITY
 
DINKINS REACHES MUNICIPAL LABOR DEAL
The Dinkins administration reached a tentative three-year labor settlement with the largest municipal unions. The settlement, which is subject to ratification by the rank and file, gives workers modest wage increases but does not include the productivity concessions that City Hall had sought. It covers 180,000 city workers in 19 unions and runs from January 1992 to March 1995. A1.
 
SOLVING A POLITICAL PROBLEM
By reaching a contract that provides modest raises for city workers before his re-election campaign begins in earnest, Mayor Dinkins went a long way toward solving a big political headache and making peace with a crucial constituency. News analysis, B2. 

RACE RELATIONS AND A NURSING HOME
Two distinct cultures exist at the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale: the 782 residents, most of them Jewish and at the end of their lives, and the 982 employees, most of them immigrants, many black, struggling to build theirs. Racism is not a blatant presence, yet as in the countless hospitals, apartment buildings and offices where members of minority groups work as nurses, nannies or custodians, often for older whites, the dramas of a city stratified by color are played out every day. A1.
 
VALLONE'S VIEW ON ST. PATRICK'S PARADE
City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone weighed in against Mayor Dinkins, saying the St. Patrick's Day parade should have been left in the hands of its longtime sponsors despite their refusal to let a gay group march. B3.
 
THE EDITOR AND THE LABOR ORGANIZER
In the fight over The Daily News, two men will be foes of a sort: Richard Esposito, an editor who will be working to rebuild the paper, and Ray Rogers, a labor organizer hired by the Newspaper Guild to undermine The News with a reader-and-advertiser boycott. B3.

PHARMACIST WITH H.I.V. GETS A JOB
After a six-year legal battle, the Westchester County Medical Center agreed to hire a pharmacist infected with H.I.V. without restricting the work he can do. That means the hospital will not lose Federal financing of $107 million a year, which had been jeopardized under civil rights laws. The Board of Legislators approved awarding the pharmacist as much as $330,000 for back pay, legal fees and "emotional damage." B5.
 
LEGISLATOR SAYS SHE WAS HARASSED
A New York State assemblywoman said she had been sexually harassed by male colleagues -- including once last month, just hours after Assembly members attended a seminar on how to avoid harassment. The Assemblywoman, Earlene Hill, a Democrat from Hempstead, L.I., would not identify the men who she said had harassed her, but she said she had been verbally abused by colleagues three times since taking office in 1988.

HEADLINE: 2 Get Ready to Lock Horns at The Daily News

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
One is an editor and former police reporter who has worked on every tabloid in town, spinning slasher tales and municipal scandals into front-page scoops. The other is a tough labor organizer who has dragged corporate giants to the bargaining table with campaigns of innovative, often harsh, pressure tactics.
Tomorrow the two men, who have never met, take on new jobs and become foes of a sort in a titanic fight over The Daily News -- the editor, Richard Esposito, helping to rebuild it for a new owner; the labor organizer, Ray Rogers, trying to undermine it, at least temporarily, with a reader-and-advertiser boycott for a newspaper union that wants to win back some of the 170 jobs cut last week in an economy move. 
 Both men were hired last week -- Mr. Esposito by Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the new owner of The News, as metropolitan editor, and Mr. Rogers by the Newspaper Guild of New York as a consultant and organizer for its planned boycott. Both men are known to associates as imaginative, dynamic and aggressive: the right stuff for what are expected to be Herculean tasks on both sides.
 
Coming From Newsday
 Mr. Esposito, a 37-year-old journalistic jack-of-all-trades who has been city editor of New York Newsday for the last three years, must rekindle a News metropolitan staff that was cut by a third last week, left in turmoil by reshuffled assignments and other changes and angered over what some called the brutal way colleagues were summarily dismissed after decades of service.
In a brief interview, Mr. Esposito declined to discuss his plans for the metropolitan staff, but associates said he would press hard to improve coverage of city government, neighborhoods, transportation and other aspects of life in New York, with writing that captures the wit, wisdom and tempo of the town.
Mr. Rogers, 48, a nationally known crusader who developed boycott techniques that rocked textile and food companies, airlines, banks and other corporations, faces other daunting problems. He must mount his campaign without the support of nine other unions representing newspaper crafts, and must defeat not just the financially ailing Daily News but also its multimillionaire owner, whose empire includes large real estate and publishing holdings.
 
Strategy Meetings
 With Newspaper Guild rank-and-file strategy meetings set for tomorrow and Thursday, Mr. Rogers said much remains to be decided about the direction and scope of his campaign. But he said in an interview that it would be aimed not only at readers and advertisers of The News but also at all of Mr. Zuckerman's businesses.
"You've got to look at his real-estate empire, at U.S. News & World Report, at The Atlantic Monthly," he said, referring to other Zuckerman properties. "You have to look into whether he's paying his fair share of taxes. I'd focus on every area where we could put pressure on him and his business and political alliances. We'll have hundreds of volunteers and we will certainly bring in community groups and other unions."
For all the difficulties they face, friends say both men have a fighting chance.
"I have a lot of respect for Richie Esposito," said Alice T. McGillion, a former Deputy Police Commissioner who knew him as a reporter and editor. "He's sensitive, diligent and accurate and most of all he knows New York. He has an appreciation for its different groups and neighborhoods."
Mr. Esposito was born in East Harlem, attended Fordham Prep and graduated from New York University in 1975, earning a degree in English literature, with honors, in three years while working as a teacher-counselor in a Federal drug program. After a year of graduate study at the University of California at Berkeley, he began his journalistic career as a copy boy for The News in 1977.
Promoted to reporter in 1980, he covered general and police assignments. He contributed to a major series on subways and once interviewed a man holed up in a hotel room who was wanted by the police in a series of attacks on nurses for which he had been dubbed "the Bellevue Slasher."
From 1982 to 1984, he worked for The Philadelphia Bulletin, CBS and a New York business magazine, and freelanced for The New York Post, Reuters and the Cable News Network. After two years as a full-time reporter for The Post, he joined New York Newsday in 1986 and was successively a reporter, assistant city editor and city editor.
Collaborating with Robert Stutman, then the head of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration in New York, he also wrote a book on drug policies, "Dead on Delivery," which was published by Warner Books last year.
Mr. Rogers was born in Beverly, Mass., into a working-class family that knew strikes and hardship first hand. He graduated from the University of Massachusetts in 1967 with a degree in sociology, was a Vista antipoverty volunteer in Tennessee and wrote a paper for a Federal agency on hunger and malnutrition in Appalachia.
 
Organized Store Picketing
 In 1973, he was hired by a clothing workers union then locked in a fight with the Texas-based Farah Company. In a preview of his later work, he helped organize picketing at stores that carried Farah slacks, prompting many to cancel orders and Farah to settle.
He became nationally known after a long struggle with J. P. Stevens, the textile company, in which he formulated his "corporate campaign" tactics. He encouraged union members to pull money out of banks that did business with the company; he mounted personal attacks on executives and trustees; he dragged other companies into the dispute, including Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Metropolitan Life. Eventually, executives resigned and in 1980 Stevens signed its first labor contract.
He has also led campaigns against Hormel & Company, American Airlines, the International Paper Company and others, often focusing on environmental, health and other non-economic issues. Few have doubted his effectiveness, although his often harsh tactics have dismayed some union leaders as well as the companies they were directed against.
In 1981, he founded Corporate Campaign, with its headquarters and a small staff in Manhattan. But in waging his campaigns, Mr. Rogers relies heavily on union volunteers and their sympathizers. Friends say Mr. Rogers, a bachelor, leads a monkish existence, living in a low-rent apartment, wearing clothing off the rack and staying in cheap hotels.
His asceticism is armor against opponents like Mr. Zuckerman, whose wealth, he believes, makes him vulnerable. "This is a man that has played with a lot of toys," Mr. Rogers said. "Well, people's lives are not toys."

Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin filled two powerful chairmanships today, appointing Assemblyman Albert Vann to head the Corporations, Authorities and Commissions Committee and Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky to be chairman of the Environmental Protection Committee.
Senator Ralph J. Marino, the Senate majority leader, was expected to name Senator Ronald B. Stafford, a Republican from Plattsburgh who is the current deputy majority leader, to be chairman of the Finance Committee, Senate officials said. 
 As chairman of the Environmental Protection Committee, Mr. Brodsky, a Democrat from Hartsdale, will play a central role in drafting laws relating to the disposal of garbage and hazardous wastes, the regulation of development in the area that supplies New York City's drinking water, and the protection of the Adirondacks.
 
Calls for Cooperation
 Describing himself as a "wild-eyed environmentalist" at heart, Mr. Brodsky, 46 years old, started his new job by calling for cooperation in the divided Legislature. "I'm not looking for a war with the Senate," he said.
Among his priorities will be to establish a trust fund to pay for a variety of environmental projects, to clean up Long Island Sound and to pass laws enforcing the Federal Clean Air Act, Mr. Brodsky said.
As chairman of the Corporations, Authorities and Commissions Committee, Mr. Vann, a Democrat from Brooklyn, will have broad oversight powers over independent commissions and authorities, including the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Public Service Commission, which sets utility rates. His committee also has jurisdiction over corporation law.
 
Opposes M.T.A. Fare Increase
 Now in his 10th term, Mr. Vann, 58, said he wants to use his committee to create economic opportunities in urban areas. But among his first concerns will be the complex budget negotiations under way to aid New York City's Transit Authority, which is facing a $265 million deficit. If the budget gap is not filled by April, the M.T.A. has said it will probably raise bus and subway fares to $1.50.
"Obviously, I'm against a fare increase," Mr. Vann said.
In other appointments, Mr. Weprin, a Queens Democrat, named Assemblyman Anthony J. Genovesi, a Democrat from Brooklyn, chairman of the Oversight, Analysis and Investigation Committee, a position formerly held by Mr. Brodsky.
To replace Mr. Vann, Mr. Weprin named Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, another Brooklyn Democrat, to be chairman of the Children and Families Committee.
 
Other Appointments
 Other appointments by Mr. Weprin included these:
Assemblyman Hector L. Diaz, a Democrat from the Bronx, chairman of the Cities Committee;
Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Democrat from Manhattan, chairman of the Mental Health Committee;
Assemblywoman Catherine T. Nolan, a Democrat from Queens, chairwoman of the Real Property Taxation Committee;
Assemblyman Joseph Crowley, a Democrat from Queens, chairman of the Racing and Wagering Committee;
Assemblywoman Barbara M. Clark, a Queens Democrat, chairwoman of the State-Federal Relations Committee.

HEADLINE: Big Leap by Kodak Helps Dow Regain 11.08

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Eastman Kodak and a crew of other unloved stocks of last year led a partial recovery yesterday from the round of selling that has beset the stock market in the new year.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 11.08 points, or 0.34 percent, to close at 3,262.75, on moderately strong volume of 217.9 million shares. 
 Kodak's 3 1/2-point gain to 45 1/4 in heavy volume accounted for more than two-thirds of the Dow's advance. The company hired a chief financial officer from outside who is known as a turnaround expert.
I.B.M. and several medical stocks, losers last year that kept falling last week, furthered the market's advance yesterday. Among the most active stocks, I.B.M. rose 1 1/4, to 47 3/4, and Merck 3/4, to 43 1/4. Even the oil stocks, dormant or declining of late, attracted some buyers.
Strategists who stayed calm despite the market's ungainly entrance to the new year, with the Dow off nearly 50 points last week, stepped up to claim vindication.
 
Selloff Called Excessive
 "We had an excessive selloff," said Peter Canelo, chief investment strategist at NatWest Securities, rattling off a list of technical indicators, put-call ratios and such, that he said backed him up. "Now, they're looking for laggards."
Elaine M. Garzarelli, a Shearson Lehman strategist, recommended yesterday that investors take advantage of the declines in such diversified health care companies as Bristol-Myers Squibb and Johnson & Johnson.
Merck, its stock floundering and gasping as of late, had the benefit of artificial resuscitation yesterday, as the board approved a billion-dollar stock buyback in addition to the $3.7 billion spent since 1985. Mr. Canelo, surprised that Merck managed no more than a fractional gain, said some investors would stay away from drug issues until they saw what health programs President-elect Bill Clinton proposed.
Investors showed no such ambivalence about the computer stocks that propelled the Nasdaq composite average up 5.19 points, or 0.77 percent, to 682.40, its fourth record in six trading sessions this year. Intel, Microsoft, Apple Computer, Cisco Systems and Sun Microsystems each advanced a point or more, performances that have recently become routine.
Steep declines in several European markets produced hardly a tremor in the United States yesterday. Alan R. Ackerman, chief market strategist at Rich & Company, said his European clients were shipping more of their pounds, lire and marks across the Atlantic, fleeing their own weak economies.
Although foreigners have usually favored the big, reliable brand-name stocks, Europeans are shifting toward smaller issues, he said. What is more, the strengthening dollar has been adding to their gains.
As for Eastman Kodak, James Joyce, senior vice president for research at First Albany, could boast of having featured the stock in an interview in Barron's on Saturday. Boast he did.
"I knew it was going to go up today," he said, before adding a bit more seriously, "I've been recommending the stock for months."

HEADLINE: Neediest Cases Helps a Survivor Who Helps Others

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
For 20 years, Jean Montoya flew with Pan Am airlines, as a flight attendant and then as a manager. She and her son Justin, 11, have spent school vacations all over the world. She saved up enough money to buy a co-op apartment on West 72d Street.
But several years ago, when Pan Am began asking its employees to take pay cuts to save the company, Mrs. Montoya's savings dwindled. Then when Pan Am went out of business last year, Mrs. Montoya, who was 47 years old, was left with no job, no money and few prospects. 
 "I'm not used to rejections," she said. "I worked for 27 years. And then they started coming right and left. I've had so many times when I'm completely without any energy to keep going. What's it all for?"
Now, with the help of a psychologist at the Catholic Charities of New York, Mrs. Montoya is trying to get back to work, by studying at a school for radiology assistants at Bellevue Hospital Center.
 
'She's a Survivor'
 Catholic Charities is one of seven organizations aided by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Times pays all of the fund's overhead, so all donations go directly to the seven charities. This year's drive ends on Feb. 28.
Mrs. Montoya was referred to the Catholic Charities by the United Way. She wanted to start a therapy group for former Pan Am employees. Friends at other airlines that had closed told her that some people were so depressed that they withdrew and started drinking heavily. Some even committed suicide, she said. Mrs. Montoya was determined that would not happen to her or her friends.
"She has been a catalyst for others," said Dr. James Sabrino, the psychologist who runs the group, which brings together a few people each Thursday. "She's a survivor."
Last year Mrs. Montoya sold her apartment and moved into Stuyvesant Town in Brooklyn, where she had been on the waiting list for six years. Everything in the apartment is someone else's cast-off, she explains proudly: "I think it looks pretty good, don't you?"
After years of handling crying babies and cranky passengers, Mrs. Montoya now spends all her time studying. Over the holidays she struggled to write a 40-page paper on bone ossification.
 
A New Life Style
 "I'm floundering," she said. "It's tough when your brain's been on vacation for 30 years."
Mrs. Montoya still worries a lot. Unemployment checks will stop in about two months. Justin's father, who lives in England, contributes little to his care, Mrs. Montoya says. And now she has no health insurance. "If I end up in the hospital, we'll be out on the street," she said.
Justin has had to adjust to a new life style. After a lifetime of holidays in Africa and Hawaii, courtesy of his mother's job, he now has to get used to no travel, no movies, and few treats like trips to fast-food restaurants. When he needs clothes, he pays for them by baby-sitting.
A year ago, one of Justin's baby-sitters discovered his singing talent. He has since appeared at the Metropolitan Opera. But Mrs. Montoya does not have the time or the money to shepherd him around, so he has had to give up performing.
Still, with the help of Dr. Sabrino, Mrs. Montoya is learning to accept her life's new limitations and to help her son accept his.
"I feel sorry for my son," Mrs. Montoya said. "All his life he had the best. He still has the best; he just has less of it."

HEADLINE: Mitsubishi Drops Mainframe Computers

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 11

 BODY:
The Mitsubishi Electric Company said today that it had ended development of mainframe computers, a decision that reflects the movement by computer users away from such large machines.
Mitsubishi's decision also stems from the stiff recession here that is forcing many Japanese companies, despite their long-term perspective, to shed marginal businesses that are unprofitable. Last month, for example, Isuzu Motors gave up development of passenger cars to concentrate on trucks and recreational vehicles. 
 "The development of mainframe computers cost hundreds of billions of yen," said Osamu Matsuo, a spokesman for the company, referring to a figure that translates into billions of dollars. "Since our share is not high, there's no merit in us putting such huge amounts of money into development."
The company will now concentrate on smaller computers and software.
Mainframes account for about 35 billion yen, or $280 million, of Mitsubishi Electric's total annual computer sales of about 300 billion yen, or $2.4 billion. The mainframe business is unprofitable for Mitsubishi, which lags far behind the leaders in the Japanese market -- Fujitsu, the International Business Machines Corporation, NEC, Hitachi and Unisys.
In 1991, Mitsubishi began reselling an I.B.M. mainframe computer in the Japanese market, the first time the American computer giant had let another company sell one of its most powerful machines.
Mitsubishi now offers two mainframe models in Japan, the EX800, which it developed itself, and the more powerful EX900, which it gets from I.B.M.
Mr. Matsuo said that Mitsubishi would continue to sell the EX800 as long as there was demand for it, but would not develop a successor. Customers that want more powerful machines will be directed to the EX900.
The move away from mainframes toward smaller machines like personal computers, work stations and central information repositories known as servers has dramatically reduced profit margins for many computer companies and is in large measure responsible for the severe problems of I.B.M., the world mainframe leader.

HEADLINE: Paine Loses $9.7 Million in Arbitration

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Paine Webber Inc. has been ordered to pay $9.69 million by a three-member arbitration panel of the National Association of Securities Dealers for misleading the nephew of the late Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
John Robson of Tulsa, Okla., the 38-year-old nephew of Mr. Walton, claimed damages for an errant trading strategy set up by a Paine Webber broker, which involved 403,300 Wal-Mart shares. "It's the only transaction I've ever done with them and it's the only transaction I'll ever do with them," Mr. Robson said of Paine Webber. 
 Paine Webber denied any impropriety in its business with Mr. Robson. "We strongly disagree with the panel's decision and we are considering an appeal," a Paine Webber spokeswoman said, reading from a prepared statement. "Paine Webber fully explained the transaction to Mr. Robson, who is a sophisticated and intelligent individual. We are confident that he understood the involved transaction."
The panel approved the award to Mr. Robson in early December. The granting of such awards by the association usually takes as much as a month to become widely known.
 
Award Part of a Trend
 The award is significant for its size and because it is part of an apparent trend among arbitration panels to award damages against brokerage firms -- not only to the proverbial naive widow or orphan. Mr. Robson is a real estate developer and the Wal-Mart shares involved in his case had a value of almost $23.78 million at yesterday's closing price of $59 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Paine Webber faced similar cases last year. Several wealthy investors won $2.25 million from the firm in September, including $1.67 million in punitive damages. Paine Webber said in September it planned to appeal the ruling in Federal District Court in Tampa, Fla.
Last June, the firm was ordered to pay $2 million in damages to a customer who held an M.B.A. degree from Harvard and had two outside investment advisers. The customer contended that his options positions were so risky that Paine Webber should have prevented him from taking them, even though he had initiated the trades.
Mr. Robson said he had opened an account with Paine Webber after meeting Stephen Brady, a broker, in April 1990. He opened the account with the intention of borrowing money from Paine Webber at interest rates lower than those available at banks.
 
Trapped in 'No Lose' Situation
 Mr. Robson said Mr. Brady had convinced him to engage in a transaction that would protect Mr. Robson from declines in Wal-Mart stock, according to Mr. Robson's filing with the N.A.S.D. The strategy did not work and caused losses as the price of Wal-Mart stock rose, the filing said. It was supposed to be "a no lose situation," Robson said. "Once I was in it, I couldn't get out."
Mr. Robson accused Paine Webber of misrepresenting the strategy and omitting information, according to the arbitration award. In the filing, he also contended that Paine Webber had committed fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and violations of Oklahoma's deceptive trade practices act.
During the hearings, which ran from July to October last year in Oklahoma City, Paine Webber said the transaction had been "entirely appropriate" because Mr. Robson wanted to protect his investment "in a volatile down market" during the Persian Gulf crisis, according to the N.A.S.D. award. Paine Webber also said the loss had been due "solely to market conditions and the client's own negligence," according to the award.

HEADLINE: Coin-Tossing Computers Found to Show Subtle Bias

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
WHEN scientists use computers to try to predict complex trends and events, they often apply a type of calculation that requires long series of random numbers. But instructing a computer to produce acceptably random strings of digits is proving maddeningly difficult.
In deciding which team kicks off a football game, the toss of a real coin is random enough to satisfy all concerned. But the cost of even a slightly nonrandom string of electronic coin tosses can be devastating to both practical problem-solving and pure theory, and a new investigation has revealed that nonrandom computer tosses are much more common than many scientists had assumed. 
 Mathematical "models" designed to predict stock prices, atmospheric warming, airplane skin friction, chemical reactions, epidemics, population growth, the outcome of battles, the locations of oil deposits and hundreds of other complex matters increasingly depend on a statistical technique called Monte Carlo Simulation, which in turn depends on reliable and inexhaustible sources of random numbers.
Monte Carlo Simulation, named for Monaco's famous gambling casino, can help to represent very complex interactions in physics, chemistry, engineering, economics and environmental dynamics mathematically. Mathematicians call such a representation a "model," and if a model is accurate enough, it produces the same responses to manipulations that the real thing would do. But Monte Carlo modeling contains a dangerous flaw: if the supposedly random numbers that must be pumped into a simulation actually form some subtle, nonrandom pattern, the entire simulation (and its predictions) may be wrong.
The danger was highlighted in a recent report from Dr. Alan M. Ferrenberg and Dr. D. P. Landau of the University of Georgia at Athens and Dr. Y. Joanna Wong of the I.B.M. Corporation's Supercomputing center at Kingston, N.Y. In a Dec. 7 article in the journal Physical Review Letters, the scientists showed that five of the most popular computer programs for generating streams of random numbers produced errors when they were used in a simple mathematical model of the behavior of atoms in a magnetic crystal.
The reason for the errors, the scientists found, was that the numbers produced by all five programs were not random at all, despite the fact that they passed several statistical tests for randomness. Beneath their apparent randomness, the sequences actually concealed correlations and patterns, revealed only when the subtle nonrandomness skewed the known properties of the crystal model.
All five of these systems for producing random numbers have long been used by scientists and statisticians with generally satisfactory results, Dr. Ferrenberg said. Major flaws turned up only recently when Dr. Ferrenberg and his colleagues were testing an ultra-powerful network of computers operating in parallel. Unlike ordinary sequential computer operations that execute programs one step at a time, parallel computing systems break up tasks into separate parts, which can be attacked simultaneously, with enormous savings in time. Parallel computers are so much faster and more powerful than the conventional kind that subtle problems in the programs they are executing come to light relatively quickly.
"We knew what the results of this test should be, and when we got errors for each simulation we tried, I thought there was something wrong with my program," Dr. Ferrenberg said. "But Dr. Wong suggested that the problem was with the random-number generators we were using, and she was right -- a reminder that no known random-number system is foolproof for all applications."
Many relationships and interactions in science and engineering can be described by relatively simple mathematical equations that have definite solutions. But other systems are so complex that the equations describing their behavior, often containing many variables, cannot be solved by ordinary mathematical manipulations.
 
Disorder Hides Order
 During the 1940's, Dr. Stanislaw M. Ulam, a mathematician recruited by Los Alamos National Laboratory to work on the atomic and hydrogen bombs, faced problems in the physics of nuclear explosions that proved too complicated to solve by conventional means. He attacked the problem by inventing Monte Carlo Simulation, in which, by filling in the blanks in his equations with successions of random numbers, he obtained probabilistic approximations of the answers the project needed.
This statistical system created an immediate demand for random numbers used in Monte Carlo equations, and the Rand Corporation of Santa Monica, Calif., published an entire book containing nothing but random numbers. But in today's complex simulations, a program typically devours as many as 100 million random digits (binary zeros and ones) per second, Dr. Ferrenberg said, and to satisfy this prodigious appetite, a separate computer program must spit out digits at lightning speed. The need for speed means that any useful random number generator must contain only a few steps and be easy for a computer to execute.
Dr. Ron Graham, a mathematician at A.T.& T. Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., explained that typical random-number generators may add a long series of arbitrary digits together, divide the result by some large number, and use the remainder as the basis for computing the next digit in the sequence.
But neither this nor any other machine-based system can produce truly random numbers. If computer-generated number sequences are long enough, repeating patterns inevitably emerge, even though they may remain hidden from their human creators.
Such patterns are sometimes discovered by accident. One system was believed to produce very good "pseudorandom" numbers, until someone plotted the numbers it produced on a three-dimensional graph. When that was done, the numbers proved to lie on a small number of planes rather than being uniformly distributed; in other words, the sequences were anything but random.
Dr. James Reeds, a computer expert at Bell, said the flaws exposed by Dr. Ferrenberg had caused problems for many users of Monte Carlo Simulations, including himself. "We all must take to heart the advice by the great John von Neumann, who wrote in 1951 that anyone who believed a computer could produce truly random sequences of numbers was living in a state of sin."
 
Catch-22 of Randomness
 Random numbers are used not only by scientists but in primitive ciphers. Modern cryptographic systems, however, encipher secret messages between government officials and banks using techniques that do not depend on random numbers alone. Most modern high-level cipher systems are based on the products of two very large prime numbers, products that are enormously difficult to factor into the original primes.
Advanced cryptographic systems, besides hiding the content of secret messages, can produce sequences of random numbers that meet tests for randomness much more successfully than sequences from ordinary random number generators. But they are far too slow for use in ordinary mathematical modeling.
There have been other ideas for improving the randomness of number sequences. Theorists have proposed that true random numbers rather than pseudorandom ones could be produced by machines responding to the radioactive decay of atoms. The instant at which a radioactive atom breaks up is completely unpredictable, even in theory, because it obeys the statistical rules of quantum mechanics, rather than any kind of causal determinism.
But Dr. Persi Diaconis, a Harvard University mathematician famous for his deep analyses of card shuffling and other approaches to randomness, believes that even atomic decay could pose problems. "Suppose such a decay were used to actuate a rotary switch, which would pick a number for the sequence," he said. "The mechanical switch could have some tiny imperfection that would bias the numbers in some way, so you would back where you started."
Another problem that would arise with any system producing genuinely random numbers, Dr. Diaconis said, is that no truly random sequence could be reproduced by the process that created it. In many cases, scientists need to be able to reproduce exact random sequences used in simulations, so that their work can be checked by others.
"We face a basic dilemma," Dr. Ferrenberg said. "We can no longer trust various random number systems that we used to think were pretty good. Now we must test every pseudorandom number generator we use, to see if it works for the particular application we have in mind. But to test it, we must know what the right answer should be, and that's what we're trying to find in the first place.

HEADLINE: Let Those Economic Winds of Change Blow

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In his "Economic Scene" column of Dec. 17, Peter Passell questions Laura D'Andrea Tyson's appointment to head the Council of Economic Advisers, concluding she is not among the "wisest economic heads" of this generation. Does the same discomfort come to the surface in your Nov. 21 Business Day article on Robert Reich, which stigmatizes President-elect Clinton's choice for Secretary of Labor for insights lacking in rigor and precision, relative to mathematical economists? 
 Mr. Passell offers the hypothesis that the President-elect has an economic policy and that those such as Ms. Tyson and Mr. Reich need fill only secondary roles as tinkerers on the already designed machine. I prefer a broader explanation.
American-style economics is getting the benefit of some empirical feedback that is often hard to come by in the social sciences. The evidence that fed back from this election was acrid, strong medicine. Your Dec. 21 Business Day article on economists dissenting from the Little Rock, Ark., conference quotes the viewpoint that the economy is in good shape -- when more than 60 percent of the electorate voted resoundingly for a change.
With such disparity between models and the real world, discomfort from the economics mainstream is not surprising.
In this light Mr. Reich's lack of an economics Ph.D. is an asset. The challenge is to escape the bounds of orthodoxy. The profession's fascination with the esthetics of mathematics has deflected the talents of a generation, and more, from the high-payoff core of the discipline: insights about human economic behavior, particularly economic social behavior. Such economists as Dick Nelson, Paul David, Brian Arthur, David Teece and Cristiano Antonelli in Europe are pursuing a new, more dynamic conception.
How do we recognize the economic wisdom Mr. Passell implicitly wishes for Bill Clinton's Administration? Mr. Passell notes that Ms. Tyson fails the ideology test (she lacks commitment to free trade) and is known for arguments that do not make enemies. If there is any hallmark of the academy most prized, it is that we leave ideology behind, that we invite those of different views to the dialogue.
In economics the seeds for new direction are sown, and the talent at work is nothing short of monumental. If we are to find some new direction, innovative suggestions must be part of the process, the reverse of contemptuous dismissal for being ideologically unsound.

HEADLINE: False W.H.O. Charges

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"U.S. Moves to Replace Japanese Head of W.H.O." (front page, Dec. 20) reports a reference by a senior United States official to a State Department document alleging Japanese intimidation to secure re-election of Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima as director general of the World Health Organization. 
 The allegations are groundless. Japan has not threatened to cut off imports of fish from the Maldives and coffee from Jamaica should these countries not support Dr. Nakajima. Nor would the Government of Japan interfere in the private sector import business for Dr. Nakajima's re-election. False too are accusations of a threat to block a loan to Algeria, of a job offer to an Agency for International Development official and of providing air tickets and traveler's checks to key delegates.
Dr. Nakajima has earned a second W.H.O. term.

HEADLINE: Northwest Cuts Fares to Help Spur Leisure Travel

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Northwest Airlines yesterday announced fare cuts of up to 40 percent for travelers who bring someone along when they fly.
The cuts in the 14-day advance purchase fares, which are not refundable and require a Saturday night stay, are an effort to stimulate leisure travel. The airline also said the new fares would help reduce attempts by business travelers to circumvent restrictions on current discount fares. 
 "Every airline needs more revenue in a soft economy," Michael E. Levine, the vice president for marketing for Northwest, said in an interview.
 
How It Works
 Under the cuts, which were effective yesterday, two travelers flying together would each receive 20 percent discounts off the lowest discount fares. Three people together would receive 30 percent discounts, and four together would receive 40 percent discounts. There are no discounts for five or more passengers.
For a round trip between Boston and San Francisco, for example, two people could travel for $448 each, three people $392 each and four people $336 each.
"If you travel with a family or friend you will get a very good discount," Mr. Levine said. He added that the cuts were not a short-term promotion but a long-term change in the airline's lowest discount fares. Analysts said the cuts would likely be matched by other carriers.
The fare cuts by Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest carrier, are another blow to an attempt initiated last spring by Robert L. Crandall, the chairman of American Airlines, to set up a simpler and more stable fare structure.
 
Undercut American Fares
 Last summer, Northwest undercut Mr. Crandall's plan with deep discounts that caused American to slash fares in an attempt to hold its new fare structure together. The move caused huge losses for the industry.
Mr. Crandall is not expected to react to the current Northwest move by cutting American's discount fares by a full 40 percent to match Northwest's deepest cut. Tim Smith, a spokesman for American, said the carrier was studying the Northwest move.
Mr. Levine of Northwest said that the decision to put in the new fares without an expiration date was a recognition that "fares need to increase for the airline industry to be viable, but that the industry needs to preserve volume leisure bookings without engaging in a constant procession of short-term deep discount sales."
He said that by requiring that one travel with another person for a discount, Northwest hoped to reduce the number of business travelers who have been overcoming restrictions on current deep discount fares, like having to stay over a Saturday night.
Some travelers, for example, were using what is called back-to-back ticketing. Under such a strategy, one would buy a round-trip ticket for travel between New York and Denver and another between Denver and New York and use one part of each ticket at different times. In this way, they could get around the restriction of having to stay over on a Saturday.

HEADLINE: $100 Million Stake in Saks Bought by Saudi Investors

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
A group of Saudi investors that includes Prince al-Walid has purchased a $100 million piece of Saks Fifth Avenue, the New York specialty store chain, through the United Saudi Commercial Bank, the bank reported yesterday.
The investment gives the Prince, who is the largest individual stockholder in Citicorp with 4.8 percent of its common shares, and his colleagues somewhat more than an 11 percent stake in the retailer, which has a book value of $900 million, according to the bank. 
 The bank said it bought the stake on Dec. 22 from Bahrain-based Investcorp Bank EC, which, with a group of Middle Eastern investors, acquired Saks in 1990 for $1.6 billion, $600 million of which was equity. Prince Walid is chairman of the bank, which is also partly owned by Bank Melli Iran, United Bank of Pakistan and the London-based Saudi International Bank, as well as other Saudi investors.
 
Equity Stake Unclear
 Investcorp is a secretive company that also owns Gucci and Color Tile and participated in an effort to resuscitate the Circle K convenience store chain. Last year, it added another $300 million in capital to Saks, but it has always been unclear how much equity in Saks is Investcorp's and how much belongs to other investors.
People familiar with the tight-lipped investment bankers who manage Investcorp said it had sold a piece of its stake to the Prince, who is the principal investor in the transaction.
As a privately held company, Saks does not publicly disclose its financial statements. Its suppliers have speculated for the last two years that the company, which sells high-priced merchandise, was struggling to keep itself in business during economic hard times.
 
Losses Incurred
 Last year, Investcorp issued a statement saying that Saks incurred unspecified losses because of the United States tax structure but said it was otherwise profitable. Suppliers in New York have complained that Saks was extremely late in paying its bills and that it had canceled or returned substantial orders at the last minute.
But this holiday season, the flagship store on Fifth Avenue was packed with shoppers, and Phillip B. Miller, the Saks vice chairman and chief operating officer, said that sales were exceeding the company's plans.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 25, 1993, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Jan. 12 about a group of Saudi investors that bought a $100 million stake in Saks Fifth Avenue misstated the relationship between Investcorp, the Bahrain-based investment company that controls Saks, and Gucci S.p.A., the luxury goods retailer. Investcorp owns a 50 percent stake in Gucci; Maurizio Gucci owns the other 50 percent.

HEADLINE: A New Question in Somalia: When Does Free Food Hurt?

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENALE, Somalia, Jan. 10

 BODY:
In this country of hunger, Faaduma Abdi Arush is cursed with corn. She has corn stored in barrels, corn stacked in sacks, corn to be tossed away as chicken feed.
Mrs. Arush survived Somalia's civil war, and she and the farm hands on her large holding even managed to tend her fields, producing a bountiful harvest of corn four months ago. 
 But when she took her crop to the market, she found that the infusion of food from relief agencies was cutting demand. With food prices falling in a bottomless tumble, no merchant wanted to risk buying her corn and then see the prices plummet still lower, she said.
"Nobody is interested," said the slender 52-year-old farmer, pointing in exasperation to the piles of corn already gone bad that had been thrown on a tarpaulin for chicken feed. "Everybody has his own relief supply."
 
When Charity Hurts
 This is the paradox of famine and famine relief. The international charity that stopped starvation eventually can become a problem in itself, threatening to destroy what little remains of the local farm economy.
Six months ago food was so scarce in Somalia that tens of thousands of people were dying of starvation, and the United Nations estimated that another 1.5 million people were in danger of death. Unscrupulous merchants speculated on the shortages, hoarding food to inflate profits and sending prices 500 times above normal.
There are still thousands of hungry and malnourished people in Somalia. But now, after a steady influx of relief food, market prices in the Mogadishu area and in the nearby agricultural regions of Afgoye and the Shebeli River valley have plummeted, especially for grains like rice, sorghum and corn, according to relief agencies, which have been monitoring the markets.
 
Rock-Bottom Prices
 The price of rice is said to be the lowest in the world, with the cost of a 110-pound bag of rice dropping to $5 over the past few months. By comparison, the same amount of a comparable grade of rice would cost about $11.70 in the United States and $120 in Japan.
The lower Shebeli valley, a three-hour drive from Mogadishu along rutted mud roads, normally produces 50 percent of the corn grown in Somalia. During the famine, only a few farmers in the region managed to keep producing, and now most farmers are just trying to get back on their feet and grow enough food for home consumption. But a new harvest is being gathered in the next few weeks, and the main growing season begins in April, threatening to add to the glut.
"We are terribly afraid the current trends in the market will hold and that the corn that's planted will be valueless," said Willet Weeks, a staff member of the American branch of the charity Save the Children, which has been working to resurrect farming in the lower Shebeli valley.
 
Breaking the Hoarders' Hold
 At first, the drop in food prices was considered a measure of the success of the famine relief program, showing that enough food had arrived in Somalia to break the monopoly of the hoarders and bring prices to a point where the middle and lower middle class could afford to buy. The falling prices also served as a disincentive to looting, since the bags of pilfered relief food no longer brought in the same kinds of cash windfalls as before.
But some relief agencies are starting to fear that the relief food will now cause another cycle of dependency by depressing the food market and making it unprofitable for farmers to farm.
"The quantities of relief food which have come flooding in here have devalued the market for local produce," said Mr. Weeks.
A sharp debate is underway among relief organizations on when to begin weaning Somalia from free relief food.
"There are big discussions," said Rhodri Wynne-Pope, the Mogadishu director of CARE. "Are we finished with relief? Are we in rehabilitation? The answer is no. We're not over the top yet."
 
2 Million Need Relief
 The International Committee of the Red Cross still estimates that two million people will continue to be dependent on relief food for the foreseeable future.
"They will need continuous feeding and nobody really knows for how long," said Horst F. Hamborg, the Red Cross spokesman in Mogadishu. "If the relief agencies would go out of the country, it would be a disaster."
But Mr. Weeks of Save the Children said it was time to start cutting back on the free food kitchens. "Prolonging free food distribution as the need is diminishing is a sure recipe for prolonging the famine," he said.
There are even disagreements over what foods to distribute. The International Committee of the Red Cross has been using a high-protein mixture of rice, beans and cooking oil in its feeding kitchens. But some other relief agencies have started to argue that the rice should be switched to wheat. They contend that Somalis are becoming accustomed to a higher-grade diet than normal, causing the devaluation of local products like corn and sorghum.
 
Some Food Sold
 As a first step toward reversing the precipitous decline in food prices, CARE and the United States Government's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance are starting a program to sell some relief food. According to Mr. Wynne-Pope, a third of the next 12,000 metric tons of food for Mogadishu will be sold, with two-thirds being distributed free of charge. The food for sale will be higher quality items like pasta and sugar. Most of the sales will be to small merchants who will be allowed to buy 20-bag consignments of food for resale.
In addition, CARE is taking bids from larger merchants on 350 metric tons of wheat flour arriving in the port shortly. The plans call for the profits from the food sales to be redistributed to the relief agencies in Somalia for projects that would create local employment.
"If you can create a reasonable price and generate employment so people can buy food, you're jump-starting the market," said Lauren Landis, a member of the United States' disaster assistance and relief team.
 
Crop Subsidies Discussed
 The relief agencies are also discussing the possibility of a price support program, in which they would buy the crops of farmers at prices that make farming profitable.
But such plans all come too late for Mrs. Arush. She said she has met with six relief agencies looking for one that would buy her corn instead of getting it from abroad. But she said they went away without any offers. She is resigned now to seeing her crop spoil.
With another harvest approaching, she is no longer producing corn. Instead she has gambled on sesame, reasoning that a sesame crop can keep longer without spoiling. Yet already the signs are troubling. She said food oil is also coming in from the relief organizations and in the past two months the market price for sesame, an oil seed, had dropped more than 80 percent.
With fields of green sesame plants, she is already dreading the moment when she will bring in her crop.
"When I have that," she said, "only God knows what I will do with it."

HEADLINE: U.S. Finds Serbs Skimming 23% Of Bosnian Aid

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
An internal report commissioned by the State Department has concluded that the effort to send relief supplies to the Bosnians is largely a failure, with the Serbian forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina skimming nearly one-quarter of all the aid brought in by air.
The report, which is circulating within the Bush Administration, also complains that the United Nations peace force and refugee officials have often yielded to the Serbs, allowing them to determine what aid is provided and who gets it.
 
Appeasement Is Charged
 "Since the start of the humanitarian airlift," the report said, "the U.N. has also sought to appease the Serb militias by providing the Serb 'authorities,' a portion (23 percent) of all relief commodities arriving by airlift, and by according them the right to inspect each cargo delivered by air or road, to approve or disapprove each cargo.". 
 In addition, the report added, the United Nations has allowed the Serbs to "approve or disapprove the ethnicity of U.N.H.C.R. convoy truck drivers, and to dictate the road convoy's route of entry to Sarajevo; in effect, the U.N. recognized the Serb militias as the de facto authority in the region." U.N.H.C.R. stands for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, whose staff has been delivering aid to the besieged Muslims in Bosnia.
The report was completed last month by Thomas O. Brennan, a relief expert who was hired by the Office of Disaster Relief, a branch of the United States Agency for International Development. Mr. Brennan spent four months in the former Yugoslavia.
In his report, Mr. Brennan said the United Nations had only limited success in delivering aid to Sarajevo "and almost no success to date in reaching groups of people critically at risk in a number of other centers in central and eastern Bosnia."
Asked to comment on the report, a spokeswoman for the United Nations commission said it was true that some of the assistance had been diverted to the Serbs, and that the the Serbs had prevented United Nations workers from providing help to some parts of Bosnia. But she added that the United Nations had no information to confirm Mr. Brennan's estimate that almost a quarter of the supplies delivered by air had ended up in the Serbs' hands.
 
'All Necessary Measures'
 "There is a war going on and we are unarmed people," the spokeswoman, Barbara Francis, said. "The U.N.H.C.R. is doing is best to negotiate the passage of relief supplies under difficult conditions. We do not have enough personnel and we not have enough trucks. Our convoys are turned back by armed irregulars."
President Bush, while refraining from using force to quell the fighting in Bosnia, pledged in July that the United States would "do whatever it takes" to insure that aid is delivered to the besieged Bosnians. And the United Nations Security Council later adopted a resolution calling for "all necessary measures" to be taken to guarantee that the assistance would be provided.
In practice, Britain, France and Spain have deployed about 7,000 troops. This size force means that the United Nations must largely depend on the cooperation of the Serbian authorities to enable the delivery of aid.
The effectiveness of the force, or lack of it, was pointedly raised last week when a Serbian soldier assassinated a Deputy Prime Minister of Bosnia, Hakija Turajlik, who was traveling under United Nations guard en route to Sarajevo from the airport there.
 
Agreement on Assessment
 An Administration official, who insisted on not being further identified, said some American officials agreed with Mr. Brennan's general assessment about the increasingly desperate situation. The official noted a recent cable the American Embassy in Zagreb, Croatia, saying, "There is or very soon will be starvation or death from exposure or disease on a significant scale in central or eastern Bosnia."
Adding to this concern, American officials recently received an appeal from Zepa, a small town in eastern Bosnia cut off from all outside aid. The appeal was transmitted by an amateur-radio operator there, American officials in the Yugoslav region said.
"In Zepa there is no food any more for several months now," the radio dispatch reads. "Is the world at last going to do anything for these people or are they just going to be amazed and shocked when one day after all this somebody enters Zepa and sends from there that there are 35,000 people dead from hunger."
Bosnian officials have also been sounding alarms. Mr. Turjlic, before he was killed, sent a letter to Mr. Bush, appealing for help in getting assistance to small towns in central and eastern Bosnia. Bosnian officials said 198 people from Zepa had died from starvation, sickness and exposure in the last 72 hours. According to the reports, 119 have recently died in Srebrenica, 71 in Bratunac and 45 in Vlasenica.
The Serbs, the report notes, have used the authority given them by the United Nations to turn back several cargos for Bosnia, including firefighters' uniforms and cold-weather clothing flown in on German and American planes.
The Serbs did not allow the United Nations to deliver aid to Muslim towns in eastern Bosnia until December.
"Within Serb-controlled territories it is the Serb 'authorities,' not the U.N., who decide how and to whom relief will be distributed," the report said.
It asserted that workers for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had accepted the diversion of supplies as the "price of doing business in the region."
 
Withdrawn From Baja Luka
 Some American officials said estimates of the amount of aid being diverted could reach 50 percent of all supplies intended for Bosnia. Noting the problems the United Nations has had operating in the region, they said peackeeping troops and the refugee officials had withdrawn from Banja Luka, where the non-Serb population is suffering from hunger and deprivation.
In recommendations that run counter to American policy, Mr. Brennan urged the West to intervene militarily both to insure the delivery of aid and to stop the killing of Bosnians.
The relief expert urged the Administration to establish havens in the towns of central Bosnia, defending them by the use of American airpower against Serbian artillery. Mr. Brennan also urged that American aircraft retaliate "immediately and massively to any interdictions of relief aid."
Some relief officials are urging military action, even amid the fears expressed by high-ranking officers about the potential of getting bogged down in a Balkan conflict.
Gen. John Shalikashvili, commander of NATO forces in Europe, warned today against trying to solve the Bosnian crisis with military force. In urging caution, he took a different position from that of President-elect Bill Clinton's nominee for Defense Secretary, Les Aspin, who has said that American air strikes should be considered.
"I'm very dubious," General Shalikashvili told reporters at a breakfast meeting, "that you can take these warring factions that are so loosely controlled, so driven by age-old hatreds that have been redoubled as a result of atrocities that have occurred in the last few months, and all of a sudden somehow through punitive action to get them to stop fighting." .
He added: "I'm just hard pressed to believe, particularly from the air, that you can somehow get them to say, oh my gosh, they're bombing that village over there, so let's stop killing each other."

HEADLINE: 'Down With Fidel!' Is Heard in Cuba, but There Is No Sign Yet of His Fall

SERIES: Cuba Alone -- Last of three articles.

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EL RINCON, Cuba

 BODY:
After walking for miles and sometimes crawling a last stretch on their knees, thousands of pilgrims began pouring into the Church of St. Lazarus as the sun set on Dec. 16. At midnight, a young priest took the microphone to hail the patron of Cuba's sick and downtrodden.
"Long live the Miraculous St. Lazarus!" he shouted over and over. "Long live Christ the King!" 
 The congregation at the church here, 12 miles south of Havana, burst into rhythmic applause and answered the priest with a more secular chant. "Libertad!" the crowd yelled, ignoring the hundreds of uniformed policemen and plainclothes agents surrounding the church. "Libertad!"
Then, as suddenly as it had erupted, the chanting stopped. More pilgrims pushed their way into the church, forcing others out, and the police agents scarcely moved. Within moments, it was as though the cry for freedom had never been heard.
 
Criticism of Castro From Man in Street
 Such protests, while still rare, have become somewhat less extraordinary as the country's economic hardships have pushed Cubans toward desperation. No longer is it remarkable for a foreigner to hear a Cuban stranger bitterly criticize the Government in a conversation struck up on the street. Occasionally, people wake up to find graffiti attacks on President Fidel Castro, although they are quickly painted over.
Yet three years after the fall of Mr. Castro's allies in Eastern Europe prompted Cuban exiles to begin thinking about packing their bags and making plans for a new Government, there is little indication that the country's growing discontent translates into a more serious challenge to Mr. Castro.
As Cuba's revolution enters its 35th year with the country more isolated than ever, the powerful instruments of political control that Mr. Castro developed with Soviet support remain firmly in place.
"In a whole series of senses, this is not Eastern Europe," said a diplomat who conceded that he had sometimes doubted that Communism would survive in Cuba as long as it has. "The economic situation may be more critical, but the political resources of the Government are greater."
In part, Mr. Castro has retained some popular support by keeping hospitals and schools running and maintaining a system of modest rewards for the loyal party members and military officers who form the the core of his regime.
The recent tightening of the United States embargo against Cuba has also helped the Government stir feelings of solidarity by reviving images of a tiny, heroic country fighting to determine its own fate in a hostile capitalist world. The advent of democracy in Eastern Europe seems only to have fed the Government's propaganda that free elections and free markets do not bring stability or food.
Mr. Castro's Government has also depended more heavily on a state security apparatus that has proved effective at crushing opposition. According to international human rights groups, the harassment and jailing of even the most moderate dissidents has risen sharply over the last two years.
Without resorting to the sort of murder and torture that characterized repression in many Latin American nations in the 1970's and 1980's, Mr. Castro has reduced the opposition to an array of small and mostly timid groups that struggle with one another almost as much as they do with the Government. One of their main problems, dissidents say, is that their sympathizers are so occupied trying to survive that they have little energy left for politics.
More than ever, perhaps, Mr. Castro also benefits from the fact that his most ardent opponents are in exile.
It is a reflection of the sense of powerlessness that has taken hold of many Cubans that some have begun looking to the eventual death of Mr. Castro -- a man of still obvious vigor at age 66 -- as one of the most likely prospects for political change.
Although younger people, especially, have grown more open in criticizing the Government, their sense of freedom seems limited.
Some Cubans critical of the Government do not speak freely even in their own homes. Even in conversations out of doors, it is almost second nature for people to make political references in sign language to avoid being overheard: a thumb and fingers pulled down and together from the chin to refer to the country's best-known beard; two fingers on the shoulder to denote the bars of an officer in the military or state security forces.
 
A Cry That Shocks: 'Down With Fidel!'
 After a former Cuban Air Force major who had defected to the United States in 1991 flew back to the island on Dec. 20 and stole off again with his wife and two children, a few people who had heard the news were making new signs: stretching out their arms, wing-like, or giving a thumbs-up.
As Cubans were choosing representatives to their local councils, the Municipal Assemblies of People's Power, on the day that the pilot defected, a gaunt man broke into a reporter's conversation with several voters at a polling place in the old Havana neighborhood of Regla.
To the shock of his neighbors, the man launched into a torrent of complaints. He had lost his job, he said. He wasn't getting enough to eat. He was tired of always being watched.
"I am not afraid to say it," he said. Then he nearly shouted words that were difficult to understand at first because he kept his teeth clenched tight. "Down with Fidel!" he was saying.
The neighbors scattered, trying not to run. The man went on complaining a while, then turned and walked home. When encountered hours later, he sat glumly on his porch, ignoring passers-by. His protest seemed to have ended as suddenly as it began.
According to the vote count watched by a reporter, nearly 20 percent of the man's neighbors had left their ballots blank or purposely nullified them, scrawling big "X" marks or writing "No." But in conversations around the neighborhood, voters suggested that not voting would have amounted to reckless defiance. According to official figures, the turnout was 97.2 percent.
 
If They Transgress, They Pay a Price
 Despite the fatigue and fear that often seem to dominate its mood, Cuba remains a Caribbean country, one in which people sustain themselves in some part with music and their own dark humor. But more and more, people say, the tension boils over.
Cubans say that fistfights break out for no good reason in the long lines of people waiting for buses or newspapers or the cardboardlike pizza sold from kiosks. Artists cross the unspoken but understood bounds of criticism, although they know it will mean they will have trouble obtaining materials or exhibitions or concert dates.
Many Cubans say such transgressions tend to generate little support because the authorities consistently respond, if sometimes only by tightening their scrutiny of presumed troublemakers.
A 31-year-old laborer, the thin, soft-spoken son of a former political prisoner, said he was certain that the occasional outbursts of protest were useful to state security officials.
"The times when somebody goes crazy and and stands up and yells, 'I can't take this! Down with Fidel!' they just come and calmly take the people away," he said. "Everyone who is there sees that. Do you think they are going to do the same thing?"
 
Castro Remains Larger Than Life
 The slow evaporation of the traditional perquisites for military and party officials and the defection of a few officers have led some diplomats to speculate that the economic crisis might begin to shake the pillars of Mr. Castro's support. There are occasional signs that the loyalty commanded by Mr. Castro may be strong but not permanent, and that he has had problems within his ruling circle.
"Many people abroad think Fidel is like our God -- that he's like Jesus Christ," said Lieut. Col. Helio Julin, the commander of an army detachment on the edge of Havana. "It is not that way. The day he is no longer capable, we will move him aside -- not only Fidel, but the entire leadership."
Last fall, Mr. Castro ousted the official considered his third-in-command, Carlos Aldana, and a full explanation has not yet emerged.
But it is also apparent that to many military officers and party members, the Commander in Chief remains a larger-than-life figure, elevated by his revolutionary deeds to a plane well above the one on which Government mistakes are made.
Diplomats also say that although Mr. Castro's support has fallen precipitously among Cubans, he remains a more popular leader and a genuine hero than his deposed Eastern European counterparts, most of whom were imposed directly by the Soviet Union.
 
The Social Gains Still Mean a Lot
 As ever, the pillars of social development under Mr. Castro -- health care and education, employment and social security -- seem to mean most to those Cubans who recall the poverty that preceded his takeover. But it is not entirely lost on their children, either.
A 24-year-old woman who works at a brewery in the western city of Pinar del Rio, for example, said that for the first time since her childhood she was having trouble getting the medication she takes for asthma. In a country of perhaps a million asthmatics, health officials said, the shortage has become chronic.
But the woman, who gave her first name as Niucha, was adamant that the system had not failed her. Though the daughter of peasants, she noted that state schools had enabled her to become a chemical engineer. She might lack for a little medicine, she said, but her stronger impression of Cuba's advantages was established by the year her father spent in one of Havana's best hospitals, free of charge, after being injured in a car accident.
"In what other country would they do that for you?" she demanded. "Tell me!"
Like recent authoritarian regimes in Chile, Paraguay and Nicaragua, the Cuban Government has sought to nourish its peoples' fears that change might prove worse than the suffering they know. Mr. Castro has also capitalized on Cubans' fears for their homes and farms if exiles from whom they were confiscated were to return.
 
The Dark Side Of Democracy
 From dozens of conversations around the island, it seemed clear that the Government is also having some success in reshaping peoples' views of what democracy had done for Cuba's former allies.
Reports from Eastern Europe play like a Greek chorus on Cuban state radio and television programs: President Boris N. Yeltsin locked in a turbulent battle with the Russian Congress after 80 percent of the country's people are plunged into poverty; disgruntled members of the Solidarity union strike in Poland to protest their lot.
"They have things now that no one has ever seen: unemployment, corruption, children working on the street instead of in school," Rolando Rodriguez, a 23-year-old Havana railroad worker, concluded of the Eastern Europeans. "What they call democracy doesn't work."
More insistent still are the Government's appeals to Cubans' deep nationalism and to the anger felt about the United States economic embargo, even by some of those opposed to Mr. Castro.
President-elect Bill Clinton, who campaigned hard for the traditionally Republican votes of Cuban-Americans, embraced a bill to toughen the embargo as "a big opportunity to put the hammer down on Fidel Castro and Cuba."
The law, called the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, was enacted in October with the intent of aggravating the economic crisis and weakening the Government's hold on power.
But since its passage, diplomats and even some United States officials say, the measure has at least momentarily bolstered the political control of Mr. Castro and eased his isolation. In November, members of the United Nations General Assembly condemned the embargo by a vote of 59 to 3. Only Israel and Romania sided with the United States; 71 nations abstained.
"For the first time, I think the United States has been placed on the defensive on this issue," Cuba's Foreign Minister, Ricardo Alarcon, said in an interview.
The specter of a United States threat has also been used as justification for the Government's periodic crackdowns on the opposition. Human rights advocates who send abroad information on Cuban abuses, for example, are imprisoned for "enemy propaganda."
After a couple of months of relative tolerance, the Government began again on Dec. 10 to harden its treatment of more moderate dissidents. More than half a dozen people, including two former Communist Party members who are now openly critical of the Government, were surrounded in their homes by state workers, members of revolutionary groups and men carrying walkie-talkies who appeared to be plainclothes security agents.
As usually happens with what are called "acts of repudiation," the incident ended with shouted insults and thrown rocks. Two of the dissidents were arrested, and one of those, Elizardo Sanchez, the leader of one of the island's human rights groups, was also reported to have been badly beaten before being freed on bail.
 
A Mob That Says It's Judge and Jury
 When a reporter and photographer tried several times that day to visit the leader of the island's other tiny human rights group, Gustavo Arcos Bergnes, a mob converged from the street corners to block the way. Identifying themselves as "representatives of the people," the men informed the foreigners they were not welcome.
"What you can say is that we are not going to let anyone come here and change our situation," said one of the men, who identified himself as Rafael Rodriguez. "When you ask objective questions, you must find that Cuba has done more for human rights than any other country in the world."
The reporter asked if the men were not violating Mr. Arcos's freedom of speech.
"We are judge and jury," the man replied. "Today we have decided that there will be no counterrevolutionary press conferences."
The reporter asked what had occasioned that decision.
"Do you not know what day it is today?" the man asked, with no hint of humor. "It is International Human Rights Day."
When the men finally retreated from Mr. Arcos's apartment almost two weeks later, the 66-year-old former diplomat cautiously invited the reporter there.
In fact, Mr. Arcos said, he and other dissidents had intended to make a statement on Dec. 10 calling for democratic changes and freedom for political prisoners. But as he fumbled for a piece of paper on which he had copied something written by Vaclav Havel, the Czech President, it seemed difficult to imagine how the grandfatherly figure might threaten anything.
"I have the hope that we are in the final stage of this regime," he said.
After a pause, he added, "If you ask me on what that hope is based -- well, on hope."

HEADLINE: Arabs to Seek U.N. Pressure On Israel Over Deportations

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Resisting a call by the Palestine Liberation Organization to suspend peace talks with Israel, Arab foreign ministers ended a meeting here today instead with a recommendation that the United Nations Security Council impose sanctions on Israel for deporting 415 Palestinians to Lebanon.
The foreign ministers, who met for two days under the auspices of the 21-member Arab League, said they would push for sanctions if Israel refused to allow the Palestinians, who are Muslim fundamentalists, to return to the Israeli-occupied territories. Israel has rejected all such appeals. 
 In a reference to the Security Council's toughness in dealing with Iraqi violations of United Nations resolutions, the league's secretary general, Esmat Abdelmeguid, told reporters at the end of the meeting: "The law must be above everybody. We want an end to double standards."
 
Fraternal Feelings Fade
 Nevertheless, the evident lack of fervor in private comments by some of the diplomats reflected a deep antipathy, shared by the P.L.O., toward militant fundamentalists from the Hamas and Holy War movements.
The two groups have contested the P.L.O.'s influence in the occupied territories and vehemently oppose peace talks between Israel and Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians. They are also affiliated with wider Arab and Iranian groups trying to overthrow Arab governments and establish Islamic republics in the Iranian mold.
A statement at the end of the meeting said the ministers "call on the Security Council to take adequate measures, including the application of the rules of Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, to oblige Israel to implement Resolution 799 immediately."
Resolution 799, passed on Dec. 18, a day after the 415 men were deported, called for their repatriation; Chapter 7 entitles the Security Council to use sanctions and other methods to enforce resolutions.
 
No Deadline Set
 The United States had served notice that it would resist such a move, even though it has condemned the deportation. When asked what the ministers would do if the United Nations failed to force Israel's compliance, Mr. Abdelmeguid said, "This will come in the proper time," adding that the Arab League had not set a deadline.
The ministers also called for an international force to protect the 2 million Palestinians under Israeli occupation, a proposal that has been flatly rejected by Israel in the past.
By far the clearest indication of how tepid support for the deportees is among Arab countries came from the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, whose country is host to 10 maverick Palestinian groups opposed to peace talks with Israel. He suggested that Arab countries continue their bilateral talks with Israel next week as scheduled and argued that regardless of the fate of the deportees, these direct negotiations with Israel were in the Arab interest.
 
Syria's Counterproposal
 Diplomats said Syria had proposed instead that Arab countries suspend multilateral talks between Israel and various Arab and international parties. Syria has not taken part in such talks and their suspension would not affect its negotiations with Israel.
This suggestion was rejected by most of the ministers, including those of Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, who are involved in multilateral talks with Israel and who said they would continue them.
Several officials strongly suggested that the fate of the 415 fundamentalists was of interest only to the degree that they might embarrass Israel. The deportees are stranded north of what Israel calls its "security zone" in southern Lebanon: Israel will not take them back, and Lebanon will not let them in.
One P.L.O. official in Tunis went further, saying that Hamas and Holy War may now appreciate that support for their "extremist positions" against peace talks is "minimal."
 
Scorn From the P.L.O.
 The P.L.O. official described the fundamentalists as a "drop of water" in the Palestinian movement which, he argued, supports a peaceful settlement with Israel, despite its call today to suspend the peace talks.
Much of the resentment against Hamas has to do with its growing ties with Iran. Hamas has opened an office in Iran and receives what the P.L.O. describes as "substantial" support from the Sudan and Iran, which have fundamentalist Governments.
In Lebanon, President Elias Hrawi today reiterated Lebanon's position that the deportees were Israel's problem. "We have closed the door to the deportees," he said in a speech to Lebanese expatriates. "For the first time in 20 years, Lebanon has taken a stand."
Lebanese commentators have said that Lebanon, which already has 400,000 Palestinian refugees, was determined not only to block the door to more but to find ways to get many out of Lebanon, if and when there is a settlement that creates an independent Palestinian entity.
Writing in Al Hayat, a London daily, the foreign editor, Khirallah Khirallah, noted in an editorial shortly after the deportation that if Lebanon were to accept the 415 Palestinians, this would encourage Israel to expel "4,000 and then 40,000" more to Lebanon.

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Groups of students from Yale University and Moscow State University first met face to face in 1985 during the "evil empire" period of Soviet-American relations. The current academic year ushered in the "empty pockets" era and doubt about the exchange's future.
The program normally includes a two-week visit by 12 Yale juniors to Moscow State and St. Petersburg in March, and a fall visit by Moscow State students to Yale, with side trips to New York and Washington. 
 But the Yale exchange, the prototype for 20 other Soviet-American student programs, is now caught in a financial vise of air fares and what students and administrators say is waning international corporate interest in Russian-American outreach programs.
For the Moscow State delegation, the biggest obstacle is airfare, which surged from a few hundred rubles in the 1980's to several hundred thousand as the national airline, Aeroflot, brought its ticket prices for Russians into line with those of other international carriers. Tickets to New York are now out of reach of all but the wealthiest Russians.
During the first eight years of the exchange program, Moscow State was financed by the Soviet Government. But in 1991 the university's administrators voted to become independent, and that brought an end a plump student government budget for overseas exchanges.
"The Russian solution to this was to look for sponsors," said Brian Carter, the outreach and exchanges coordinator for the Council on Russian and East European Studies at Yale. "They essentially sold two slots on the exchange to nonstudents in return for those businessmen buying all the tickets" for students participating in the program.
But Russian sponsors who could afford to pay for 15 roundtrip tickets -- 12 students and 3 advisers -- to the United States proved so hard to find that the Moscow State delegation had to postpone its fall trip. Artur Demchuk, the Russian coordinator of the exchange, said Monday that he had finally found three sponsors and that the exchange was set for late February.
Russian businessmen understood the value of a tie with Yale, Mr. Damchuk said; "by participating in the exchange they hope to make contacts and find possible business partners."
Moscow State had indicated it would host a Yale delegation even if it was unable to finance the return exchange, but a tight economy also jeopardized the Yale exchange. New Haven participants must not only pay their own airfares but also raise at least $6,000 to cover the cost of being the hosts of their Russian counterparts.
The Yale group appealed to alumni with Russian ties, wrote 100 corporations, with "not a single positive response," and begged exchange alumni for donations, said Andrew Froberg, a senior from Naperville, Ill., who was in the exchange in 1992.
"We've just tried anything that we can possibly think of," Mr. Froberg said. "It's been enormously frustrating."
Two last-ditch appeals, one to a private donor and one to the university itself, yielded enough money for this year's program.
Yale and Moscow State are not alone in their troubles. A 4-year-old program between the University of Maine at Orono and Kharkov University has been suspended because the Ukrainian university cannot afford to participate, said Bill Whitaker, the project coordinator at Maine.
And an exchange between Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., and Tbilisi State University in Georgia has been indefinitely suspended because of the civil war in Georgia.
Yale alumni of the program hope that their university's exchanges and the others can survive current hard times. "I will always retain the memories as well as many newfound friends," said Stanley Wu, a Yale senior from Arlington, Va., who participated last year.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Managing the Technological Frontiers

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
For a hog breeder in Minnesota, it's using new ultrasound equipment to measure exactly how lean a hog is in a few seconds with a minimum of hassle to man and beast. To a metal processor in Cleveland, it's figuring out how to wield laser light like a blacksmith's hammer to pound extra strength into steel. To a company that tracks the popularity of radio and television programs, it's a device that automatically records any broadcast someone is listening to or watching, no matter where they are, without their touching a button.
No enterprise is without its technological frontiers. Command of those frontiers has long been recognized as a key to competitive success, but the globalization of national economies has stepped up pressures on business leaders and policy makers alike to manage the invention and use of new technology more effectively. 
 "The sea level of competency has been rising in many industries," said Richard N. Foster, a partner at McKinsey & Company who has written and consulted on innovation tactics and policy.
Spending by both business and government on research and development continued to grow through the recession, according to the annual surveys of the Battelle Memorial Research Institute in Columbus, Ohio.
Outlays are projected to edge up again this year to $70 billion by government and $83 billion by industry. It will not be known for years, though, whether the spending increases are supporting more innovators or better results per innovator.
The diversity of the technological frontiers is probably the biggest hurdle facing would-be technology managers and policy makers as they grapple with where to spend money and what tax policies and other rules should influence those decisions.
"There are always going to be fundamentally new developments but the real basis of innovation these days is finding what already exists and combining it in new ways to address a particular problem," said Patrick Nunally, partner in Intellisys Automation Inc., a new-technology development company in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., created by former employees of General Dynamics.
 
Adopting Military Systems
 Mr. Nunally's company has been working with the Arbitron Company to adapt signal-processing technology used in military systems like missile guidance to audience sampling. Currently, audience sampling depends on devices attached to particular television sets and hand-written diaries.
Arbitron plans to introduce a pocket-sized device next year that would automatically recognize any broadcast in the vicinity of the person wearing it from a slight alteration in the broadcast signal.
The fundamental breakthrough underlying the Arbitron device is also behind developments as diverse as smart bombs and lights that go on when someone in the room claps. It is the mathematical work nearly two centuries ago of Jean Baptiste Fourier, whose equations made it possible to separate out the sound or light waves of different frequencies and amplitudes that make up complex sounds and visual images.
Developments in microelectronics, sensors and high-performance materials continuously open up new applications of Fourier's work by allowing more precise signal analysis -- and adjustment -- at lower prices.
In the case of the Arbitron device, Intellisys cuts out snippets of inaudible sound waves that are part of a broadcast sound. Around 99.99975 percent of the signal is unaffected, Mr. Nunally said, but the changes are detectable for the recording device.
"The tricky part is making sure that the frequency you can't hear is still in the range that can get through the cheap speakers on the average TV or radio," he said.
Sophisticated tinkering is also the basis for a metal-pounding laser being developed by Battelle for Wagner Laser Technologies, a Decatur, Ill., subsidiary of the Wagner Casting Co. of Cleveland. The device is based on a high-powered laser Battelle acquired in the late 1970's for government-financed research on fusion energy. During the early 1980's, Battelle figured out how to use the pulses to vaporize paint on the surface of a part and create a small explosion.
By simply covering the surface with water, the explosive forces are channeled into the metal so that photons, as light particles are known, end up compressing the metal just as a blacksmith does when he pounds it.
The concept was useless economically until Battelle shrank the laser, which filled two rooms, and shortened the charging time between pulses from eight minutes to about a second.
New materials developed by fusion researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and electronic controls developed for other applications in recent years have resulted in the prototype of the table-top device that Wagner believes it can turn into a valuable business tool.
"It's still too expensive to use on cheap parts for the auto industry like gears and brackets, but it will be useful for increasing the life of aircraft components," said John R. Koucky, the Wagner executive overseeing the development. Battelle is currently building the first commercial device.
In Chokio, Minn., Bruce Zierke is using ultrasonic images to figure out which of the hogs on his breeding farm are good candidates to help the booming pork industry toward its goal of leaner products. The devices send a sound wave into the animal that is reflected differently by bone, muscle and fat, allowing a receiver to form an image of the animal's insides.
The first device Mr. Zierke bought in 1988 cost $600 and could penetrate only far enough to give him a rough idea of how much back fat the hog had. Last summer, he spent $24,000 for new equipment and software that not only clearly details the back fat but also provides other useful data.
The new device is similar to those used by obstetricians to examine developing babies inside the wombs. But it represents decades of independent work, said James Stouffer, a former Cornell University animal scientist who recently became president of Animal Ultrasound Services.
"We went into a lot of blind alleys trying to overcome all the obstacles in an economic way," Dr. Stouffer said.
While a human will lie still in an ideal setting for capturing a good image, he said, pigs squirm and live in barns where dust, humidity or temperature variations are tough on machinery.
 
Innovation in Small Steps
 All three cases show how most innovation takes place in small steps that are built on years of work and, in most cases, by advances in other sectors driven by considerations over which the pioneers have no control. Experts point out that even if the pioneers could see a way to move farther faster, those they depend on for resources have a lot of incentives to be cautious.
"When you run a factory, for example, you are interested in technologies for everything from assembly to telecommunications to shipping to sweeping the floor, but you are probably only an expert in 2 percent of the technologies on which you are dependent," said George H. Kuper, president of the Industrial Technology Institute in Ann Arbor, Mich. "For the rest, you'll look for incremental opportunities that others bring to you and you won't buy any technological solution until you are confident that there is somebody to call at 3 A.M. if it doesn't work."

HEADLINE: How Trade Pact Plays on the Farm

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ASBURY, Mo.

 BODY:
Proving the adage that the devil is in the details, soybean farmers here are finding that their profits hinge on the fine print of a trade agreement.
In the two months since the Bush Administration struck a deal with the European Community on farm trade, it has become ever more apparent that the pact amounted to a victory for the United States on grain subsidies and a victory for Europe on subsidies for soybeans and other oilseeds.
 
Missing Passion
 Yet amid the brown stubble fields and oak and elm tree copses of southwestern Missouri, the soybean farmers seem to be remarkably indifferent. Their attitudes illustrate how Americans who are the most affected by trade talks are often the least impassioned. 
 By contrast, environmentalists and lobbyists for the soybean industry are angry, and tens of thousands of European grain farmers have taken to the streets of Paris, Bonn and Strasbourg in violent demonstrations against the pact.
"It's real nonproductive to get angry -- we've dealt with unfair trade for a long time," explained Mark A. Larson, a soybean farmer in Jasper, Mo. "As a farmer, you learn to kind of roll with the punches."
The punches, in this case, come in the form of technical details that can easily get overlooked in pressure-cooker negotiations: Was the million-ton limit on production from certain acres to be calculated based on raw oilseed or on the meal byproducts? American farm lobbyists are unhappy because the United States apparently relented to a European demand that the calculation be based on the byproducts, meaning subsidies for European production may decline less than initially believed.
"Every day that goes by, I get less and less pleased," said Steve M. Yoder, the president of the American Soybean Association, St. Louis, the industry's main trade group. "The agreement is getting less and less acceptable all the time."
Mr. Yoder recently sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan and Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, protesting the deal and calling it inadequate.
 
Key Support
 The opinions of American farmers and their lobbyists are crucial to winning Congressional approval of a 108-nation trade pact now under negotiation that is aimed at reducing global trade barriers and stimulating a weak world economy. American trade negotiators have long depended on farm groups for political support, because a quarter of American farm output is exported.
[Bush Administration trade officials are now racing to complete a second deal with the European Community that would reduce import tariffs on a broad range of manufactured goods and raw materials. They submitted on Friday a detailed list of tariff cuts to community officials and other international trade negotiators in Geneva.]
 
Confusion on Pact
 Soybean farmers here and in nearby towns said that they had heard few details of the November farm subsidy pact, and were pessimistic about the chances for changing it. They pointed out that soybean prices are now strong. And they said that the pact would not actually hurt them, although it would also not help them nearly as much as their lobbyists had hoped.
"We've been told that it should be to our advantage -- things have been unfair for the last several years," said Marvin L. Riley, who grows soybeans and corn on his 1,500-acre farm here. "I don't know enough about it to know if that's true."
And a few farmers said they understood European concerns, even though they may not like the agreement. "You can't blame the E.C.," said N. Scott Jarrett, who grows soybeans and wheat across the state line in nearby Baxter Springs, Kan. "They came out of World War II and they couldn't feed themselves."
 
Real Impact
 The agreement has two key provisions. It calls for a 21 percent reduction over six years in export subsidies, which the United States and the European Community use primarily to sell grain to poor countries. The pact also calls for a reduction in oilseeds acreage, although some oilseeds could still be grown for industrial purposes on the land set aside.
The oilseed deal has already taken effect, but the export subsidy deal will take effect only if an overall world trade pact is concluded and approved by Congress.
The deal on export subsidies was a modest victory for the United States, farm industry lobbyists said, because the 21 percent reduction would be calculated in such a way that the European Community would actually have to cut subsidies by 38 percent.
Oilseed production in the European Community soared during the 1980's because of the subsidies, depressing oilseed prices around the world. "Fifteen years ago we were in paradise, and since 1980 it has been pure hell," complained Ronald L. Crain, as he sat in a steel-frame barn on his farm in Carl Junction, Mo.
To be sure, the Bush Administration had sought the complete elimination of export subsidies. But the Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter and Reagan Administrations failed to win any reduction in European farm subsidies.
The reduction in soybean acreage was more modest than the cut in export subsidies. A key compromise, reached during the final hours of negotiations in Washington in November, was renegotiated in December.
Top American and European officials agreed on Nov. 19 that the European Community would take 15 percent of its oilseed acreage out of production, but that farmers could plant up to a million tons of oilseeds on this land for industrial use.
European officials then rushed to catch the last available flight that day to Brussels, and nobody bothered to mention how the million-ton limit would be calculated, said Jules Katz, the senior deputy representative for the United States.
 
Conflicting Calculations
 Soybeans and two related oilseed crops, rape seed and sunflower seed, are ground after harvesting. Their oil is used in vegetable oil and the production of paint and ethanol. The crushed residue, known as meal, is fed to livestock.
American negotiators assumed that the limit applied to the raw oilseeds, and drew up legal language accordingly. They also told farm lobbyists that the limit covered raw oilseeds. "When we wrote it up, we said a million tons of seed equivalent of meal," Mr. Katz said.
But after the agreement had been announced, European officials told American officials that they intended to limit production on the set-aside land to one million tons of meal.
Depending on the type of oilseed, 2.3 tons of raw oilseeds may be needed to make one ton of meal. So the European position would mean allowing the production of up to 2.3 million tons of raw oilseeds -- close to what the land might have produced if it were not taken out of production.
 
'A Misunderstanding'
 Mr. Katz called the dispute over measurement "a misunderstanding" and said the actual production on the set-aside land might be small. The community requires that farmers obtain a contract from an industrial user of vegetable oil before planting any seeds on land that has been set aside, and such contracts may not be available for even one million tons of raw oilseeds, he said.
But officials in the soybean industry warned that such contracts could become plentiful if the community encouraged the production of truck fuel from oilseeds.
Environmentalists have joined soybean lobbyists in voicing dissatisfaction with the agreement, and now find themselves in the unusual position of criticizing the Bush Administration for starting out with the right policies and then compromising. Greenpeace, for example, issued a report on organic farming in December that vehemently criticized the pact.
 
Greenpeace Objections
 Greenpeace said that limits on land in production may encourage farmers to use more chemicals and that continued export subsidies may undercut food prices in poor countries.
 A study earlier this year on the effects of a partial liberalization of farm trade predicted that the economic output of very poor, food-importing countries in Africa would be $7 billion less in 2002 with a global trade pact than without it.
But the same study, paid for by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based group of 24 industrialized nations, found that the output of other poor countries would increase by $91 billion. It concluded that the third world over all needed a global trade pact.

HEADLINE: Municipal Labor Accord Is Seen As Budget Hurdle

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Fiscal experts and Dinkins administration officials said yesterday that the tentative labor settlement New York City reached on Monday with municipal unions, while reasonable, would make it much harder to close the city's budget gap next year and might force the city to cut services.
The fiscal experts also expressed skepticism that the contract would ever produce a more productive work force. But city officials said they believe they have built into the accord a powerful mechanism for hammering out productivity agreements between the city and its largest unions. 
 The three-year settlement, covering 180,000 workers in 19 unions, gives workers wage and benefit raises totaling 8.25 percent by March of 1995. Although it does not spell out productivity concessions, it sets up a three-member panel made up of labor, management and an independent arbitrator to negotiate work-rule changes that could save money.
 
$2.1 Billion Budget Gap
 The question of whether the pact will lead to a more productive work force has become crucial. Mayor David N. Dinkins has very little flexibility in finding ways to close a budget gap that, with the cost of the settlement, has now risen to $2.1 billion for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. He has promised not to raise taxes, and his plan for closing the gap depends on nearly $700 million in highly uncertain aid from the state.
Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the state Municipal Assistance Corporation, said, "Since it is impossible to increase taxes again, paying for this settlement can only come from an unexpected improvement in the economy, which I certainly wouldn't bet on, or on productivity, or on other means which must involve some reduction in the size of the work force."
Mr. Dinkins, who vowed for a year to hold out on wage raises at the bargaining table until the unions agreed to work-rule changes and other concessions, acknowledged yesterday that he had backed down from that position, saying it had been "a negotiating stance of sorts."
 
Independent Arbitrator
 Mr. Dinkins said the contract sets up an independent arbitrator with power to issue binding decisions and bring the city and the unions together on productivity efforts, a productivity czar of sorts. In the settlement, the two sides have agreed to propose at least six ways to increase workers' efficiency by June, he said.
While city officials would not discuss details of the proposals the panel will consider, officials said the ideas included increasing some workers' caseloads in the Human Resources Administration, allowing the city greater flexibility in deploying custodians in city buildings and reducing the size of crews that repair roads.
Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group, expressed doubts the city and unions would quickly be able to agree on concrete reforms to raise productivity. Without them, the city will have to slash workers to balance the budget. "You're basically ending up with a situation where John Q. Public will pay for it in one of two forms -- either through higher taxes or service cuts," he said.
The city's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, said it was still unclear whether the city would have to cut services to close next year's budget gap. The city, he said, can pay the $428 million cost of the labor settlement in the next fiscal year through bond refinancing and unanticipated revenues from taxes, fees and investments. But doing that would still leave a $1.7 billion budget gap.
The city is hoping the state Legislature will approve a $680 million package of new taxes, Medicaid relief and educational aid, as Mr. Dinkins has requested, but the state's own budget problems make that uncertain. Even if the state delivers the aid, the city "will still have additional stretching to do," Mr. Michael said.
 
Mixed Reactions
 Labor leaders had mixed reactions to the productivity panel.
"Certainly when you look at what we've had before, there has been a reluctance on our part to engage in this process because there was no clear independent measure of what constituted productivity," said Arthur Cheliotes, the president of the Local 1180 of the Communications Workers of America. "It usually meant a reduction in the work force."
James Butler, president of Local 420 of the hospital workers union, said the panel was "window dressing" that allowed the Mayor "to save face." He said his union would not be receptive to proposals aimed at getting more work from fewer workers.
But Barry Feinstein, president of Teamsters Local 237, said creating a panel or a czar in effect guarantees there will be decisions made."
The city's Labor Commissioner, James Hanley, predicted the panel would work because for the first time the city has established a citywide method for negotiating work-rule changes and other concessions, with binding decisions by an arbitrator. "I think it's a breakthrough," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Everybody Loves a Winner, And Especially His Coattails

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
WHATEVER honeymoon Bill Clinton might enjoy after becoming the nation's 42d President, he will be hard pressed to match the outpouring of affection already being displayed along Madison Avenue.
Commercials and advertisements featuring Mr. Clinton, whether congratulating, celebrating or spoofing him, seemed to have begun appearing almost as soon as the final votes were tallied on Election Night. The main reason: To an industry that thrives on change, Mr. Clinton's victory embodies change, whether significant (the baby boomers succeeding the World War II generation in leadership roles) or frivolous (Socks the cat replacing Millie the dog as First Pet). 
 And how could executives whose boundless optimism makes Pollyanna look pessimistic not embrace a candidate who ended his acceptance speech by declaring, "I still believe in a place called Hope"?
"People wish the man well and hope for the best," said Pete Smith, a vice president and associate creative director at Martin Williams Advertising in Minneapolis. "It's a chance to express that good will."
Martin Williams created a print ad promoting 3M's Post-It Tape Flags line of color-coded tabs. The ad, which began, "It's a big job, Mr. President," called the tabs a tool to locate "the little points that might help frame a solution" to problems like the economy, the environment and education.
Using the President-elect in ads typifies a time-honored marketing strategy called borrowed interest, which tries to draw attention to a product by linking it to a larger event or personality.
"Any cause you can associate with him is to the benefit and value of that cause," said Dr. Jay Winsten, director of the Alcohol Project at the Center for Health Communications of Harvard University's School of Public Health in Boston.
Between Christmas and New Year's Day in 1990 and 1991, the broadcast TV networks ran a public-service commercial, furnished by the Harvard Alcohol Project, in which President Bush warned of the perils of drinking and driving. But after the election, Dr. Winsten said, the project decided to have Mr. Clinton participate instead.
"It was done to capitalize on the freshness, newness and excitement of the incoming Administration," he added. "At this point in time, Bill Clinton is a very attractive and popular spokesperson."
That thought was shared by Nat Whitten, co-creative director at Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano in New York.
"His approval ratings are still quite high, so it's a good time to use him," said Mr. Whitten, whose agency created a print ad for Moosehead beer pegged to the contretemps over Mr. Clinton's military service record. An excerpt from a newspaper report that he "ate a hamburger and drank a Moosehead draft beer" at a restaurant appears under the headline "Proof that President-elect Clinton didn't avoid the draft."
Mr. Whitten added, "If a year from now everyone has questions about Clinton's talents, we probably wouldn't run the ad."
Ads like Moosehead's also offer an inexpensive method for a marketer to become associated with Mr. Clinton, far cheaper than, for instance, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to become an official sponsor of activities at his inauguration next Wednesday. And such ads can skirt problems that often accompany more intrusive promotions. For example, Anheuser-Busch is being accused of turning the inaugural parade into a "beer commercial" because its Clydesdale-drawn Budweiser wagon will take part.
Some marketers, though, are demurring at pitches carrying Clintonesque themes. Despite extensive coverage of the President-elect's penchant for visiting its restaurants, McDonald's "has no plans to use him in any of our advertising," said Jane Hulbert, a spokeswoman in Oak Brook, Ill., because "it's just not something we do."
Mr. Whitten said that made sense because "it's like the President-elect wanting to associate himself with McDonald's, rather than the other way around." Presidents come and Presidents go, but the Golden Arches, presumably, are steadfast.
And some marketers are already adopting other political figures, on the theory that Clintonmania will spawn a spate of lookalike ads.
General Mills, for example, is running a television commercial, by CME KHBB Advertising in Minneapolis, presenting a self-described "breakfast expert" who looks and sounds like Ross Perot, complete with flip charts, colorful colloquialisms and a toll-free "800" telephone number. He urges viewers to prove that Oatmeal Crisp with Apples "can beat the taste deficit" by calling the number to obtain a coupon good for $1 off a package of the new cereal.
Craig Shulstad, a spokesman for General Mills in Minneapolis, said response to the commercial, at 65,000 calls as of Monday, had far exceeded expectations. He said that the company would run the spot for three weeks instead of the planned two weeks.

HEADLINE: Clinton Aide Demurs on White House Staff Cuts and Recovery Plan

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Jan. 12

 BODY:
Appearing to retreat on more campaign pledges, a top aide to Bill Clinton signaled today that the President-elect might not be able to cut the White House staff by 25 percent or have an economic-recovery plan in place by Jan. 20, Inauguration Day, as promised.
Mr. Clinton's spokesman, George Stephanopoulos, today described the White House cuts as a "goal," and said no more on the recovery plan than that it would be ready in "the next few weeks." The Clinton campaign had stressed that it would be vital to have a recovery plan in place on "day 1." 
 This comes after several days of suggestions from Mr. Clinton's economic advisers and other allies that the President-elect's promise of a tax cut for the middle class was less likely because of the worsening Federal budget deficit. It also comes after Mr. Clinton himself said the soaring deficit numbers meant he would have to modify his pledge to halve the deficit in four years.
While the Clinton team has explanations for these modifications, they nevertheless raise questions of which campaign pledges Mr. Clinton does or does not intend to keep.
 
When Demands Compete
 In his campaign platform book, "Putting People First," Mr. Clinton declared, "We will reduce the White House staff by 25 percent and challenge Congress to do the same."
Today, Mr. Stephanopoulos said such a reduction was a "goal" of the Clinton Administration but not an ironclad commitment. The issue seems to have come up because Mr. Clinton is having trouble satisfying competing demands about who will work where in the new Administration.
With a week to go before assuming office, he still has not named his White House staff because of what transition aides describe as wrangling over who gets in and who does not, although some Clinton aides say the staff announcements are finally expected Wednesday.
The Clinton people have also encountered legal and other obstacles that make cutting the staff more complicated than many expected. For instance, some White House positions exist by statute and can be dissolved only by Congress.
 
'There Will Be Some'
 "We are looking at the White House staff right now," Mr. Stephanopoulos said. "We are trying to figure out where it is most appropriate to make cuts. I don't know where those cuts will be, but I am certain there will be some."
In the campaign, Mr. Clinton and his aides also repeatedly said they would have an economic-recovery plan ready by the time he took the oath of office. And on Nov. 24, Robert B. Reich, Mr. Clinton's choice for Labor Secretary, who was then heading the economic transition team, said in an interview that Mr. Clinton planned to present his economic package to Congressional leaders before Inauguration Day so they could get working on it immediately. That goal has now clearly slipped away.
"We are reviewing the exact situation we are dealing with in terms of the deficit," Mr. Stephanopoulos said.
Asked then when they would have a full economic program before Congress, he said, "I think what we are going to try to do is make sure we have the whole package and present it in a coherent way, and I think we will have that over the next few weeks."

HEADLINE: Campuses Are Hurt by Computer Giants' Woes

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 12

 BODY:
The nation's two largest computer makers, I.B.M. and Digital Equipment, last year announced huge retrenchments, and the fallout has now reached America's college and university campuses.
Educators nationwide fear that high-technology education will sharply decline because the companies are reducing their financial and material contributions. In the mid-1980's, when the economy was booming, computing was the hottest major on many campuses, and computer makers, hungry for new markets and eager to have their latest systems adopted by future engineers and managers, were donating computers to universities by the truckload. 
 "Companies like I.B.M. and Digital Equipment would donate work stations to universities, and then they would staple a check to the outside of the box to support faculty research," said John Moussouris, a computer designer who was a co-founder of the Mips Computer Company, in Sunnyvale, Calif., part of Silicon Valley.
Now, the International Business Machines Corporation, based in Armonk, N.Y., and the Digital Equipment Corporation, based in Maynard, Mass., have been laying off thousands of workers or paying them to retire. And educators say that not only will graduates find scant job opportunities in the computer field, but that the financial support for innovative research, the supply of new hardware and fellowships for graduate study is rapidly drying up.
"We're at a watershed," said James H. Morris, chairman of the computer science department at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. "The restructuring of the computer industry has put academic computer science at a turning point."
 
Gloomy Outlook for Year
 Craig Smith, publisher of the Corporate Philanthropy Report, in Seattle, said he expected a new round of cuts in the corporations' giving next year. "Until now, I.B.M. and Digital have generally been able to retain levels of contributions," Mr. Smith said. "But now there's a sense that they are dealing with a structural problem, and in 1993 we might see some more significant declines."
Jean Bonney, Digital Equipment's director of external research, said, "There will be changes and there will be clearer goals and more scrutiny on projects, and our funding will be more closely tied to business."
But John A. Boudreaux, an I.B.M. spokesman, maintained: "We're not slashing our contributions dramatically. They're being reduced, but institutions will still be getting money from I.B.M."
 
Deeper Cuts Expected
 Administrators at those institutions, however, are running scared. At Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, administrators fear that I.B.M. financing of computer science, around $1 million a year for the past 20 years, may soon dry up. "Every time they come here it is like a funeral," said Michael Dertouzos, director of the M.I.T. Lab for computer science.
The cuts made by big computer makers are not likely to dramatically affect kindergarten through 12th grade. "There has been a lot less reliance on philanthropy in the past decade, because we haven't been doing research and development," said Leroy Finkel, director of media services for the San Mateo County Office of Education in California.
There is also less reliance on I.B.M. products in elementary and secondary schools, which have long been prime territory for Apple Computer. By contrast, Apple has contributed significant amounts of equipment to colleges and universities but has not provided as much financing for research and graduate work as I.B.M.
During the 1980's, I.B.M. and Digital Equipment lavished money on grand research projects, like Project Andrew at Carnegie Mellon and Project Athena at M.I.T., both of which developed software for tying powerful desktop computers known as work stations into networks that share data. Now such projects have ended or are being scaled back, Professor Morris said.
 
An Industry Redefined
 "I'm very concerned because I don't know how I can continue to be an institution that leads in information without the strong support of the computing industry," said John W. McCredie, vice provost for information systems and technology at the University of California at Berkeley.
In the redefinition of the computer industry in recent years, smaller, more nimble manufacturers than I.B.M. and Digital Equipment have come to the fore. But these companies, like Sun Microsystems and Apple Computer, which make machines and software, Microsoft, the world's largest software company, and Intel, the pre-eminent chip maker, have not picked up the slack.
The newer computer manufacturers have been slow in developing philanthropic programs, and the programs they have are comparatively small scale. And while hardware makers frequently donated money and equipment, hoping that faculty members and students would write software that would make their new computers more attractive to customers, powerful software companies like the Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., have little incentive to subsidize the development of software that might compete with their own, said Professor Morris.
The campus cutbacks by I.B.M., the world's largest computer maker, and Digital Equipment, the second largest, are noticeable both in absolute dollar amounts and in the form the contributions take. I.B.M., which is still the largest corporate contributor to nonprofit and educational institutions in the United States, says that it has consistently given 40 percent of its contributions to education during the last seven years. But the company has cut its overall corporate contributions to nonprofit organizations and universities from a high of $189.2 million in 1985 to an estimated $120 million last year.
 
New Formula for Donations
 Digital's corporate contributions to nonprofit organizations and universities totaled $25 million last year, down from $30 million in 1991. Last year, the company announced support for a $15 million three-year project to develop advanced computer databases at the University of California at Berkeley, its largest current research investment.
In 1992, both companies changed the ratios according to which they match donations by employees. Digital now provides 50 cents for each dollar contributed by an employee to a university; it used to match dollar for dollar. I.B.M., which donated $2 for every employee dollar, has reduced that to 1-to-1. And where I.B.M. once matched some employee dollar contributions with $5 dollars worth of hardware, it now offers $3 worth.
Such matching contributions are an important source of corporate giving to the nation's universities, said Priscilla Lewis, an executive at the Council for Aid to Education in New York City. In 1991, matching grants accounted for 36 percent of all corporate giving, Ms. Lewis said.
Nationally, she said, corporate support for education is stagnant, having grown at an average inflation-adjusted rate of 7.7 percent a year from 1976 to 1987. Today, unadjusted growth rates are 2 to 4 percent.
 
Some Bright Spots
 While support for basic computer science and electrical engineering research may suffer, some educational institutions may benefit from computer makers' focus on specific technologies. For example, at M.I.T.'s Media Laboratory, a research institute that specializes in new multimedia computer technologies, I.B.M. doubled its financing last year, said Nicholas Negroponte, the laboratory's director.
"I.B.M.'s movement to consumer electronics and multimedia make us more of an attractive funding target than general computer science and electrical engineering departments," Mr. Negroponte said.
David Farber, a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, commented: "In a funny way, the contraction of these companies seems to make them much more focused on where they should invest in the universities. They're much less willing to dump a million dollars of miscellaneous hardware, and they're much more willing to support research related to their interests."
The shift to research that can be quickly translated into new products is well suited to some computer scientists, but it has raised deeper concerns about the shift away from basic research. Some educators say they fear that the shift will be accelerated by the Clinton Administration's desire to harness technology policy to international competitiveness.
Educators at some campuses said they had anticipated some of the changes in the computer industry and had taken precautionary measures.
Richard E. Kaplan, the vice provost for research and academic computing at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles, said the campus had made a commitment to phase out all mainframes by October.
Yet the problems faced by the biggest computer makers may still haunt his campus, Mr. Kaplan said. At stake may be a high technology library that U.S.C. has been planning for more than a decade. The project was to rely on donations of computer equipment and multimedia software when completed next year. Mr. Kaplan said now he does not know where the hardware will come from.

GRAPHIC: Photos: With the largess of computer companies another relic of the booming 1980's, schools are finding donors earmarking their gifts to specific technologies. At the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles, Dr. Richard E. Kaplan, above, is troubled. The future of the school's high-tech library is clouded because donations of equipment were counted on to complete the decadelong project.

HEADLINE: U.S. Students Advance In Math, for a Change

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
After years of grim news about the academic performance of American elementary and secondary school pupils, a new preliminary report indicates that the nation's students made significant gains in mathematics achievement between 1990 and 1992.
Overall average proficiency among American students rose five points since 1990 in the 4th, 8th and 12th grades, the three grades tested, according to a preliminary report made public today by the National Assessment of Education Progress, a Federal testing organization. 
 The report found some unevenness in the gains. Students in the Southeast lagged behind students in the Northeast, the central United States and the West. There was a significant decline in the average proficiency of eighth graders in poor urban areas. At all three grade levels, private school students performed better than public school students.
While 37 percent of the students tested failed to reach what was considered a basic level of achievement, it was an improvement over the last test in 1990, when 43 percent failed to reach that level.
 
'A Half-Grade Increase'
 Though troubled by the setbacks among the poor, education officials were generally buoyed by the results.
"This is a big jump in math scores," said Education Secretary Lamar Alexander at a news conference announcing the test scores. "This is not like a one-point increase in the S.A.T. scores," the Scholastic Aptitude Test for college admissions. "This is more like a half-grade increase in achievement."
But Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, criticized both the timing and the results of the tests. Full state-by-state results will be issued in the spring.
"My reaction to the premature reporting of the results of the 1992 NAEP in mathematics is premature delight over the progress our students have made since 1990," said Mr. Shanker. But he added, "I would be curious to hear how the money-does-not-make-a-difference crowd of the outgoing Administration explains the fact that test scores in disadvantaged urban districts just happened to stall during the past two years of a recession."
Known as the nation's report card, the 1992 NAEP test indicated that the overall percentage of students who performed at or above the proficient level rose to 20 percent from 15 percent in 1990. Proficiency achievement by grades rose to 18 percent from 13 percent at the 4th-grade level, to 25 percent from 20 percent at the 8th-grade and to 16 percent from 13 percent at the 12th grade.
 
Effect of New Standards
 Mr. Alexander and several educators attributed the increases to the new standards adopted by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics two years ago. The standards detail a mathematics curriculum that all teachers should use nationally.
This is the second time that the NAEP report categorized students' performance by achievement levels: basic, reflecting partial mastery of fundamental knowledge and skills; proficient, indicating solid academic performance that represents competency over challenging subject matter, and advanced, meaning superior performance.
The percentage of students who reached the basic level rose to 63 percent this year from 57 percent in 1990. Achievement rose to 3 percent overall from 2 percent at the advanced level, at which students should be able to "generalize and synthesize concepts and principles."
Mr. Shanker noted that the standards for the different levels were under dispute. The General Accounting Office, the Government auditing agency, criticized the methodology of how the standards were set in 1990.
The National Assessment of Education Progress is working on setting standards for the other academic areas, including reading and writing, social studies and geography.
Critics fear that schools will be unfairly judged by the poor achievements of their children.
 
Highlighting Inadequacies
 But Mark D. Musick, chairman of the National Assessment Governing Board, an independent group that oversees the testing organization, said that setting standards would help demonstrate that American students, though improving, still lag behind students from other industrialized nations.
"We still have a long way to go," Mr. Musick said.
The 1992 achievement levels were established by the American College of Testing under a $1.4 million contract. The 1992 assessment tested 26,000 students in 1,500 public and private schools across the nation.
Ramsey Selden, director of the state education assistance center of the Chief State School Officers, said, "The most encouraging thing in this is that the percentage of kids who met the proficient level, an ambitious standard where we want the bulk of our kids performing, that's increased 4 to 5 percentage points."

HEADLINE: Phyllis Wallace, 69, A Labor Economist In A.T.&T. Lawsuit

BYLINE: By LEE A. DANIELS

 BODY:
Phyllis A. Wallace, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, died last weekend at her home in Boston. She was 69.
Officials at M.I.T. said yesterday that she had died of natural causes. 
 Dr. Wallace was Professor Emerita of Management at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T. In a career that spanned nearly four decades, she achieved distinction in a field in which there were few women.
In the early 1970's she directed studies for a Federal lawsuit charging the American Telephone & Telegraph Company, then the largest private employer in the United States, with racial and sexual discrimination. The suit led to a 1973 decision that found the company guilty of discrimination and produced significant changes in its employment practices.
 
Two Funds in Her Honor
 Her book, "Equal Employment Opportunity and the A.T.&T. Case," published in 1976 by the M.I.T. Press, discussed the strategy and importance of the case.
Dr. Wallace retired in 1986. The Sloan School endowed two funds in her honor to support black doctoral candidates and black visiting scholars at the school.
She was born in Baltimore, and received a bachelor's degree from New York University in 1943 and a master's and doctorate from Yale University in 1944 and 1948, respectively.
Early in her career she taught at the City College of New York and at Atlanta University, and worked for the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Her appointment at the Sloan School in 1975 made her the first woman to gain tenure on its faculty.
She is survived by her mother, Stevella Wallace; a brother, Samuel Wallace, and three sisters, Lydia Mills, Ophelia Wallace and Margaret Campbell, all of Baltimore.

HEADLINE: The Opportunities of Incumbency

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
While incumbency surely carries its burdens, it also offers substantial opportunities, as Mayor David N. Dinkins has demonstrated repeatedly in the last two weeks.
In the first 12 days of the new year -- one in which the Mayor plans to run for re-election -- Mr. Dinkins unleashed a blitz of actions and initiatives intended to court constituencies central to the coalition that put him in office three years ago. 
 The Mayor began the new year in San Juan, P.R., attending the inauguration of a new Governor of Puerto Rico and in effect paying homage to the Puerto Rican New Yorkers who constitute about 80 percent of New York City's Hispanic voters. Two days later, he delivered his annual State of the City address, which offered a smorgasbord of inexpensive but carefully targeted new or enhanced city services, from day care to medical clinics for the poor.
 
Fulfilling Promises
 Mr. Dinkins followed that with an announcement of a new city registry for unmarried heterosexual and homosexual couples. The registry and some of the rights that will come with it, like the same access for registered "domestic partners" that spouses now enjoy at city hospitals and city jails, was intended to begin to meet campaign promises the Mayor made three years ago to gay voters.
Those same voters were no doubt also in mind the next day, when Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly announced he had awarded the permit for the St. Patrick's Day parade to a new coalition of liberal Irish-Americans who would permit lesbians and gay men to march as groups for the first time.
Then, the Mayor reached a tentative contract agreement on Monday with a coalition of municipal labor unions whose enthusiastic support was crucial to his narrow victory in 1989 over his Republican challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former United States Attorney who lost to Mr. Dinkins by 2 percentage points.
Mayoral advisers contended yesterday that important governmental considerations helped determine the timing and substance of many of the recent announcements. Some advisers argued, for example, that more immediate pressures -- including state arbitration of the teachers union's contract, which is to begin today, and the need to complete a preliminary city budget by the end of the month -- had more to do with the timing of the labor settlement than did political considerations.
 
'An Imperative'
 "Each one of these things has a rationale and an imperative of its own," said First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel. The mayoral race is, of course, a significant part of the administration's calculations, Mr. Steisel conceded. "But to say that the election is the motivating factor would be wrong," he said.
Even so, in just a dozen days the Mayor managed to address major concerns of many of the critical elements of his political coalition: Hispanic New Yorkers, gay voters, liberal whites and municipal union members. Labor is in some ways particularly critical because it carries a second appeal for Mr. Dinkins since a major portion of the city unions' members are black New Yorkers, who make up his core constituency.
"Hey, it's election year," said Norman Adler, a political consultant and lobbyist. "Ed Koch did it, everybody does it. What he's done is good politics. He is strengthening his base, and that's what he's got to continue to do."
Of course, the Mayor did not offer these important constituents all that they want. Some representatives of gay and lesbian groups were dissatisfied last week when the Mayor's plan for registering domestic partners did not include what they view as a major campaign promise from 1989: the same health insurance benefits for the live-in partners of homosexual city workers as those for heterosexual spouses.
Mr. Dinkins also remains politically vulnerable to the efforts of his political opponents to make his incumbency work to their advantage.
 
Management Problems
 Mr. Giuliani and Andrew J. Stein, the City Council President, who plans to challenge Mr. Dinkins in the Democratic mayoral primary next September, have already indicated that they will seek to tie the Mayor to the recession, unemployment, perceptions about crime in New York and a host of other urban ills, including what they consider Mr. Dinkins's failure to make local government more efficient.
Incumbency also leaves the Mayor subject to criticism over management problems in city agencies. Just yesterday, Deputy Mayor Cesar A. Perales said the city would hire 300 new caseworkers for the Child Welfare Administration, to increase by 20 percent the number of child-abuse investigators. The decision followed a series of articles in The New York Times that described how sharp reductions in the number of caseworkers had undermined the city's ability to protect children from abuse.
Mr. Dinkins's incumbency also allows political opponents to question his leadership, particularly during crises like the civil unrest in Crown Heights and Washington Heights. Some elected officials and political consultants, for example, think that the outcome of the mayoral race could hinge on the extent to which liberal Jewish voters turn against the Mayor in anger over his handling of the racial violence in Crown Heights.
Mr. Giuliani described incumbency as a double-edged sword for Mr. Dinkins. It allows the Mayor to tailor city initiatives to constituencies and to make ceremonial gestures, he said. But it also leaves a record, including the labor settlement, that Mr. Giuliani said would enable him to characterize Mr. Dinkins as a "status quo mayor" unwilling to make fundamental changes in how the city works.
"I would just ask people, 'Do you want four more years like this?' " said Mr. Giuliani. "If you want four more years like this, vote for him."
Mr. Adler argued, though, that incumbency gave Mr. Dinkins significant advantages, and he contended that, with the exception of President Bush, incumbents did far better than expected last November.
"Incumbency may have looked like an albatross, but the people who saw it as an albatross were looking at the wrong bird," Mr. Adler said.

HEADLINE: Bush's 'Courageous' Economic Error

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
The President's top economic adviser said today that he had wanted the Bush Administration to take more aggressive steps to spur the economy's recovery from recession, but that Mr. Bush, despite the electoral risks, made a "courageous" decision to try to ride out the rough period without such measures.
This resulted not only in political defeat, suggested Michael J. Boskin, head of the Council of Economic Advisers, but also in an economy that is still growing too slowly. The current growth rate is about 3 percent, and the Administration predicts that rate will continue through 1993. 
 Mr. Boskin made his comments in briefing a small group of reporters on the release of the Economic Report of the President, an annual book-length document required by law, whose publication was speeded this year in light of the inauguration next week of President-elect Bill Clinton.
 
Rebuts Gloomy Notions
 Among other things, the report took pains to challenge two notions that its authors said had gained considerable currency -- that the United States is in substantial economic decline and that its recent problems can be traced to major policy mistakes over the last 12 years.
"The American economy is the largest and most productive in the world," the report states. "Not only does it have the highest per capita levels of productivity and output of any industrialized country, but even its modest growth in 1992 surpassed the performance of other major industrialized countries."
Germany and Japan slipped into recession in 1992, joining Britain and other countries whose growth has lagged.
 
Urges Caution on Health Care
 The report also cautioned against seeking solutions to the explosion in health-care costs that are not grounded in the economics of the marketplace.
Both national health insurance and so-called pay-or-play plans -- the latter requiring employers to either provide coverage for workers themselves or pay the Government to do so -- would have perverse results, the council said. Among them would be a slower pace of medical innovation, long waits for treatment and little, if any, reduction in the growth of total spending on health, the report said.
Until today, it had not been so clear that the chairman by late 1991 was actively urging greater stimulus for the lagging economy, though with little effect.
"It was a close call, economically," Mr. Boskin said, indicating that he thought an extra boost might turn out to have been unnecessary but would have posed little risk and thus "perhaps the political outcome would have been different."
 
Cites Bush's Biggest Error
 Acknowledging that "hindsight is seductive," as he put it, Mr. Boskin said the Administration's biggest error was failing to convey to the public a full and accurate picture of the state of the economy. While he did not elaborate, Mr. Boskin seemed to be referring to an extended unwillingness to declare publicly that the economy was not as bad as portrayed by the Democrats, for fear, perhaps, of being labeled out of touch or insensitive.
By Election Day, however, the economy had expanded -- albeit modestly -- for six straight quarters and inflation over the preceding 12 months had been held to 3 percent. And while job growth was extremely slow, the unemployment rate, 7.3 percent, was more than three percentage points below the 1981-82 peaks.
Still, as today's report also described, the nation's productivity growth has been extremely sluggish for more than two decades, and Mr. Boskin said he could not claim that a recent pickup represented anything more than normal post-recession improvement.
"I'm cautiously optimistic about that," the chairman said, "but it's way too early to tell."

HEADLINE: Gunman Killed in Chase Said to Have Violent Past

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 12

 BODY:
State police investigators today were trying to piece together what may have set off an Old Lyme man's rampage through rural Connecticut on Monday, and to determine whether the state troopers who cornered the gunman and shot him to death after a multicar chase acted appropriately.
It remained unclear whether a 13-year-old junior high school student who was wounded at the scene was shot by the gunman, Dwight G. Pink Sr., or by the troopers. The boy was riding in a school van that Mr. Pink, 42, apparently commandeered in East Haddam after a car he had stolen became disabled. 
 "As far as who was actually responsible for shooting the boy -- we still don't know," said Sgt. Scott O'Mara, a spokesman for the Connecticut State Police.
But the sergeant said that given the "extreme disregard for human life" that Mr. Pink had demonstrated, the decision to force the van off the road appeared to have been correct. "Quite conceivably there could have been some fatality in the van had troopers not intervened," he said.
 
Signs of a Violent Streak
 Meanwhile, some Old Lyme residents who knew Mr. Pink said flatly that they were glad he was dead. They described him as cruel man with a criminal history and uncontrollable violent streak that many neighbors had witnessed more than once.
"It should have happened a long time ago, before innocent people were hurt," said Ronald Rando, owner of Ron's Gunshop in East Lyme. Mr. Rando said his 82-year-old father was badly beaten by Mr. Pink in August, during a robbery at the store.
Mr. Pink was out on bail, awaiting trial in that case, and had a long criminal record before that of burglaries, robberies, and assaults, according to state police records.
The teen-age student who was wounded, Joshua Sawicki of Ledyard, was shot once through chest, but his doctor at Middlesex Hospital in Middletown, Jonathan D. Blancaflor, said that the boy was expected to fully recover and to be out of the hospital in perhaps a week. The bullet passed through the youth's body, making more difficult the task of deciding what caliber of gun shot him.
The police troopers were all firing 9-millimeter pistols, Sergeant O'Mara said. Mr. Pink had a small caliber handgun, the sergeant said, but he declined to identify it further.
 
Wounded Salesman Improves
 The other man wounded in the two-hour drama also showed improvement today. David L. Walden, 37, a car salesman from Old Saybrook who was accompanying Mr. Pink as he test drove a Mustang, was forced from the car along Interstate 95 in East Lyme and shot three times by Mr. Pink, according to the state police account issued today.
Mr. Walden, who was wounded in the face, the abdomen and the shoulder, underwent eight hours of surgery at Lawrence and Memorial Hospital in New London on Monday night. His condition was upgraded from critical to serious about noon today. A hospital spokeswoman said Mr. Walden might lose the sight in his left eye.
Police officials today issued an appeal for the driver of sky-blue van, seen carrying Mr. Pink at one point in the afternoon, to come forward for questioning. Witnesses said the van, which had damaged rear doors and out-of-state license plates with dark letters on a white background -- possibly New York's -- gave Mr. Pink a ride to a gas station in East Haddam to buy a can of gasoline after the stolen Mustang ran out of gas.
 
'Just Happy He's Dead'
 The second student riding in the hijacked school van was not injured and the van driver, Irene Schott, of Norwich, was treated only for cuts from broken glass and released.
People who knew the dead man said they should consider themselves lucky. One neighbor who said she knew the family for 20 years vividly described seeing Mr. Pink viciously beating his dog with a baseball bat while the animal was tied up.
At Kelly's Silo Inn, a bar in Old Lyme from which Mr. Pink had been banned for several years for disturbing other customers, the manager, Joanne Stone, said Mr. Pink had threatened to kill her just last Friday for refusing to serve him.
"He lived the way he died; it didn't surprise me at all," Ms. Stone said. I'm just happy he's dead, and I'm relieved that I wasn't hurt and that more people didn't get hurt by him."
A lawyer who was defending Mr. Pink in the gun shop robbery case, Edward J. Peters, said today that Mr. Pink was unemployed, had been under the care of a state-employed psychiatrist and was taking lithium, a mood control drug.
Approximately 60 troopers -- some of whom were off-duty and responded to the scene after hearing radio reports -- were involved in the chase. It was unknown if any of them knew who was in the van or his record and reputation as they pursued it through the wooded roads in the south-central part of the state.
The communities involved are too small to have their own police departments and rely on the state police, based at Troop K in Colchester. Troop K is home to the state police's SWAT team and the hostage negotiation team, both of which were en route to the scene when Mr. Pink was killed.

HEADLINE: Where Have All the Flowers Gone?

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
In a move that may transfer a $70 million industry along with a dash of color from Manhattan to the Bronx, the four largest flower wholesalers in midtown announced yesterday that they would move to a new site that will be built in the next two years in an abandoned rail yard in the South Bronx.
They said they expected the 14 other wholesalers who remain in midtown to follow them, providing an economic boost to the Bronx while carving the heart out of the Flower District, for more than a century one of the few fragrant sections of Manhattan, where potted trees often crowd the sidewalks and men embracing bundles of roses bustle between storefronts and waiting trucks. The wholesalers are now concentrated in storefronts along the Avenue of the Americas, between 26th and 28th Streets. 
 "The city just got more and more congested, and the businesses have gotten bigger," said Victor Rallis, owner of George Rallis Inc., a wholesaler, and president of the group of the four wholesalers that signed the lease for the new space yesterday. "People say, 'Why did you pick the Bronx, of all places?' Well, we picked a location that happened to be the Bronx."
The wholesalers will be the first tenant of a development project project that sits on 90 acres in the moribund Penn Central Rail Yards across Bronx Kill from Randalls Island, in the Port Morris section. From there, Mr. Rallis said, it will be easier for wholesalers to truck their tulips and birds of paradise deeper into New Jersey and Connecticut, in addition to serving their present clients -- retailers who arrange and sell the flowers -- throughout the region.
 
'We'll Miss Them'
 Mayor David N. Dinkins praised the decision because it would keep the wholesalers, who had considered moving to New Jersey, in New York. But it was clear that the Bronx's gain was Manhattan's loss.
"We'll miss them," said Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President. "They added a great deal of life and color to their neighborhood." But, she said, "in the long haul, it's great for the industry, great for the Bronx, and great for the city." She said she did not know who would move into the vacated space.
The Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, said the decision was a victory for his borough. "The South Bronx has taken a lot of hits over the course of decades, but I think one can argue that good things are happening now," he said.
Mr. Ferrer said that, for the Bronx, the wholesalers' move would mean "that a once nearly abandoned piece of land next to some of the city's soundest and most exciting and potentially profitable infrastructure will now be revived."
The city is providing no special incentives to the wholesalers beyond the standard package available to any city company that relocates in the city limits, said Neil Pariser, senior vice president of the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, a private, nonprofit economic development corporation that works closely with the city government.
 
350 Jobs Moving
 To help with the move, each of the wholesalers who moves will receive a grant from the city, probably of $30,000 to $40,000, Mr. Pariser said. In addition, the wholesalers will receive a tax credit of $500 for each employee they move to the new center.
In all, the wholesalers expect to move 350 jobs when the building is opened, and to create another 300 as they expand over the following three to four years. They expect the other 14 wholesalers to sign leases as the project proceeds.
Mr. Rallis said he regretted leaving the Flower District, where his father created his business in the 1940's. "Change is not always easy, but we're businessmen," he said. "We have to do what's best for our business. The market is not going to survive in its present location."
The three other wholesalers who have signed a lease are Paul Meconi Inc., Harry Vlachos and Kiamos & Tooker, according to the South Bronx group. The wholesalers will move into a 120,000-square-foot building to be constructed for between $7 million and $10 million. Construction is to begin this August and be completed by fall 1994.
Some of the handful of flower and plant retailers scattered through the Flower District said they were considering following the wholesalers up to the Bronx because it was cheaper and more convenient for them to stay near them.
 
To Move, or Not
 "We'll definitely move," said Susie Grohusky, manager of the Mornhurst Gardens Company, a retail and commercial landscaping business. "This is a place you're supposed to get good deals, and it makes no sense now."
But others said the wholesalers' move would not hurt them badly. "Wherever they move, they'll deliver anyway," said Anna Lebberes, manager of International Garden Inc. "The only problem is when we run out during the day." She said she also worried that she would receive inferior flowers once the wholesalers move, since she would have to rely on deliverers and would no longer be able to pick them out herself.
Mr. Rallis said the wholesalers may eventually be able to ship their flowers even farther from the New York region by using the rail lines, which the Galesi Group, the developer of the project, plans to revive.
"They're going to become a major modern rail terminal that's going to be able to compete with anything else in the region or the nation," said Francesco Galesi, president and principal owner of the Galesi Group. He said he expected a paper recycling and de-inking plant and a waste transfer plant to move into the rail yards alongside the flower wholesalers.

HEADLINE: First Student Testifies in Suit To Integrate Hartford Schools

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST HARTFORD, Conn., Jan. 12

 BODY:
Milo Sheff, the 13-year-old Hartford student who is the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking to integrate his city's schools with those in 21 suburbs, testified today in Superior Court. His subject: his first experience at summer camp.
"Did you have trouble at first?" Wesley Horton, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the suit, known as Sheff v. O'Neill, asked him. 
 "Yes," replied Milo, who had just testified that in eight years of school in Hartford, he has had one white classmate. "I was the only black. It was hard to relate because I didn't know what to talk about. I dressed different, I talked different, we had different interests."
 
Problems With Sports
 Mr. Horton asked if even sports posed a problem.
"They were really into baseball," Milo said of the camp's white children. "I have no idea what baseball is about."
After three weeks of testimony by teachers, principals, sociologists and education professors, Milo Sheff was the first child to take the stand. In a suit contending that the racial and economic segregation in Hartford's schools denies children an equal educational opportunity, Milo established a new voice in the courtroom, that of a young person convinced that he was missing something important by attending schools that have almost no white students.
Does it make a difference that you have not had white classmates, asked Mr. Horton, who in the 1970's brought a landmark suit, Horton v. Meskill, on behalf of his own son that won greatly increased state aid for schools in Connecticut's cities.
"It's hard to know about somebody if you haven't talked to him," Milo said. "I have had experiences, but what about those people who haven't had the experiences that I have had?"
Those experiences, he said, occurred during three years at a summer camp in Litchfield County operated by the United Church of Christ. His mother, Elizabeth Sheff, is a lay minister for the denomination and director of its Just Peace Ministries.
 
Experiences at Camp
 Life at camp became better after his first week, he said, once he got to know the other children. And in subsequent years the camp attracted a larger number of children from minority groups.
Would that kind of experience be good for other children in the city, Mr. Horton asked. More than 90 percent of Hartford's students are black or Hispanic.
"It would be good for everybody," Milo said, "so when they get to the workplace they won't be like I was, confused."
Milo is one of 19 children from Hartford and its suburbs who are named as plaintiffs in the suit, which is seeking to break up the racial isolation and concentration of poor children in Hartford's schools by linking them with those in surrounding towns.
The suit contends that white children in Hartford's suburbs, as well as black and Hispanic children in the city, are harmed by attending schools that do not reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of the society they will enter as adults.
The assistant attorney general leading the state's defense, John R. Whelan, had no questions.

Corporate Debt Volume Still Heavy

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The heavy volume of new corporate debt continued yesterday, but investor demand remained strong, pushing down the yield of a large new Canadian issue to the low end of expectations.
Activity also picked up in the municipal market with the pricing of a $1.6 billion bond issue by the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency. Most of the issue was a refunding of bonds previously sold when interest rates were higher. 
 Traders expect that the supply of new issues will continue to weigh on the Treasury market, though demand for many issues remains strong.
The Province of Ontario priced its record $3 billion deal yesterday. That offering in the corporate market and the $1.6 billion North Carolina Power Agency offering in the municipal market were the main focus of the day. Though the demand was strong for the new issues, the magnitude of the supply is expected to exert upward pressure on yields, traders noted.
Ontario's $3 billion global bond, which was marketed to large investors on Monday, was priced yesterday through the joint lead underwriters Goldman, Sachs & Company and Salomon Brothers Inc.
The coupon for the 10-year global bonds was 7 3/8 percent. The bonds can be sold simultaneously in all markets and trade according to the domestic market's currency. Underwriters priced the bonds at 99.693 to yield 7.419 percent, or about 76 basis points more than the comparable United States Treasury note. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The yield spread was on the low end of the range traders had expected for the Canadian issue. Some had seen a spread as high as 79 basis points.
In the municipal market, the tentative pricing of a $1.6 billion North Carolina Municipal Power Agency bond issue through underwriters led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company was the centerpiece.
The maximum yield at pricing was 6.50 percent for a revenue bond due in 2021. For an investor in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent bond yield is about 9.03 percent.
Much of the debt included refunding revenue bonds. Yields on shorter-maturity serial bonds ranged from 3.85 percent for an issue due in 1995 to 6.30 percent in 2009. Longer maturities offered yields of 6.47 percent in 2012, 6.45 percent in 2013, 6.27 percent in 2017, 6.30 percent in 2018, 6.45 percent in 2022, 6.33 percent in 2023 and 6.42 percent in 206.
The revenue bonds to raise new cash were priced to yield from 4.60 percent for an issue due in 1997 to 5.65 percent in 2002, 6.25 percent in 2007 and 6.30 percent in 2013.
 
Treasury Securities
 In the government securities market, trading was steady but described as dull, as prices took an early dip about the time the Ontario deal was priced.
"There was some selling when the Canadian deal was priced as investors swapped into corporates, creating a downward draft," said John P. Costas, a managing director of the First Boston Corporation. He said many traders were preparing for today's auction of new seven-year Treasury notes.
Mr. Costas described the auction of new seven-year notes as the first significant supply for the Treasury market to absorb this year.
Traders said testimony yesterday by the Treasury Secretary-designate, Lloyd Bentsen, before the Senate Finance Committee, which recommended his confirmation, had little impact on government security trading.
Some of the strength in the movement off yesterday's lows was traced to the North Carolina Power deal, which may have caused some buying of Treasuries. The issuer bought government securities to put aside to pay for future interest and principal payments on the municipal issue.
By late in the day, the price of the 30-year bond was off 11/32 , the third decline in four trading sessions. The yield rose to 7.47 percent, from 7.46 percent on Monday. In when-issued trading, the seven-year note being auctioned today was offered at a price to yield 6.37 percent.

HEADLINE: Bank Money Market and C.D. Yields Down

 BODY:
Yields offered by banks on money market accounts and certificates of deposit for the week that begins today are slightly lower than in the week before.
In the metropolitan New York market, the weakness was mostly in money market returns; outside the area, it was in certificates of deposit, according to the latest survey by The Bank Rate Monitor. 
 At the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills on Monday, average discount rates were down modestly for the second consecutive week. The auction is regarded as a harbinger of deposit rate changes at banks in the weeks ahead.
The average rate at auction was down 8 basis basis points for a three-month Treasury bill, to 3.07 percent, and down 9 basis points for a six-month bill, to 3.28 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In the New York area, the average money market account is down one basis point, to 2.72 percent. Analysts note that the slide in money market accounts is now more than a month old.
 
6-Month Yield: 2.98%
 The average New York rate for three-month certificates remained unchanged at 2.82 percent, while the average yield on a six-month C.D. slipped another basis point this week, to 2.98 percent.
For the most part, commercial banks offered only slightly weaker rates than those at savings banks.
The banks posting the sharpest changes in C.D. yields this week included the Republic National Bank for the second straight week. Republic dropped the yield on its money market account by 16 basis points, to 2.58 percent.
River Bank America shaved 10 basis points off the yield on its three-month and six-month certificates, to 2.90 percent and 3.15 percent, respectively.
Outside the New York market, average money market account yields at 20 large banks are unchanged this week, at 2.68 percent, while the average six-month C.D. is off a basis point, to 3.02 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on moneymarket accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, Jan. 13, 1993. Some C.D. yields a sume reinvestment after maturity. Yield are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

On the New Deal's Effort to Put Youth to Work

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:

The New Deal and American Youth
Ideas and Ideals in a Depression Decade
By Richard A. Reiman
253 pages. University of Georgia Press. $35.
Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal echoes down to our time because, once again, there's talk of action in the first hundred days after Jan. 20 to spur the economy and provide jobs by Government intervention. Roosevelt's alphabet agencies -- W.P.A. (Works Progress Administration); C.W.A. (Civil Works Administration); C.C.C. (Civilian Conservation Corps), and a half-dozen others -- were created to overcome the Depression and to lift spirits. 
 The N.Y.A. (National Youth Administration), one of the smaller agencies created during the Depression, is the subject of "The New Deal and American Youth," by Richard A. Reiman, a historian who teaches at Georgia Southern University in Statesboro. His well-documented book is an object lesson in what happens when a daring program has to leap the legislative and administrative hurdles in Washington.
Mr. Reiman writes that agencies like the National Youth Administration were considered dangerous and un-American by their opponents. Yet the National Recovery Act in 1933 and the N.Y.A. in 1935 were in the American grain; advocates of change could point to the Morrill Land Grant Act in 1862, which established over 70 land-grant colleges, laying the foundation for government-sponsored higher education.
The youth agency was intended to help Americans between the ages of 18 and 25. But what kind of help and toward what end? One group of officials in Washington considered it to be just another relief agency, with make-work jobs in schools and community centers. Another group saw it as a teaching tool to educate the young about how to function intelligently in a modern democracy.
The Roosevelt Administration wanted to do something for the hundreds of thousands of school dropouts and unemployed youths, particularly those whose families were on relief. Unlike the Civilian Conservation Corps, whose young men worked on specific projects to plant forests and clean rivers, the youth agency was treated with suspicion as a form of regimentation. The President's advisers feared that the public might not want a vague national organization for young people. Many Americans were aware that in Nazi Germany, millions of marching students served in the Hitler youth organization.
Mr. Reiman writes: "The humane liberal democrats who advised the President did not quite know what to make of the Hitler Youth and its equivalents. That such programs warranted condemnation was never in doubt. The question was whether the New Deal ought to establish a democratic alternative to the Hitler Youth. In other words, an important thrust of the early New Deal was to hold adults to their patriotic loyalties by demonstrating that a democracy was just as capable as a dictatorship of fulfilling the health and employment needs of its people. Should not the New Deal establish a program to impart this lesson to the young? A significant faction in the New Deal thought the answer to this question was yes."
At first, Aubrey Williams, the executive director of the youth agency, concentrated on relief for the unemployed, but eventually jobs and education were combined. The agency began to fill the educational void, with training as well as aid programs for high school and college students. New Dealers believed educators should supplement their middle-class-oriented curriculum, aimed at dispensing a traditional liberal-arts education, with job-training courses. Through the N.Y.A. and other agencies, the Roosevelt Administration started down the road toward transforming the Federal Government from a financier of schools to a schoolhouse itself.
The author points out that the youth agency came into existence by executive order, not legislative action. Needless to say, Eleanor Roosevelt worked behind the scenes to bring the the agency to life. The Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 had allocated nearly $5 billion for relief. From that pie $50 million was sliced for the N.Y.A., which was placed under the nominal jurisdiction of the Works Progress Administration. This was an administrative way to conceal the idealistic aims of the youth agency.
One of the little-known facts found in "The New Deal and American Youth" is that the youth agency was used as a conduit to aid a small number of refugees from Hitlerism; through the agency, they were promised the private sponsorship and support that was necessary to enter the United States. But President Roosevelt and the State Department stepped gingerly, as books like Arthur D. Morse's "While Six Million Died" have noted in detail. Mr. Reiman writes, "The N.Y.A.'s ability to rescue refugees was hampered by other factors, including the Administration's passion for anonymity, its obsession with 'Americanization,' and its focus on public opinion to the exclusion of the needs of the refugees."
"The New Deal and American Youth" would have been a stronger book if the author had gone beyond the libraries and archives and interviewed a number of people who, as young men and women, had been assisted by the National Youth Administration. This could have personalized the significance of the New Deal agency and explained its lasting effects. Nevertheless, there's enough here to recommend the book for the President-elect's night reading shelf.

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: Confirmation Roundup;
H.U.D. Choice Wary of Selling Public Housing

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Henry G. Cisneros, President-elect Bill Clinton's choice for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, voiced strong reservations today about one of the Bush Administration's showcase programs, which is meant to sell public housing units to their tenants.
"I don't think we can outright endorse the concept," he said in an interview after a confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. He said he feared burdening the tenants with expensive or decrepit homes. 
 Mr. Cisneros's predecessor, Jack F. Kemp, had placed the program at the center of what he called "a conservative war on poverty." But the program's critics, including those in the President's Office of Management and Budget, had called it dauntingly expensive, with renovations and financing costing as much as $100,000 per unit.
In testimony at today's hearing, Mr. Kemp enthusiastically endorsed Mr. Cisneros. Afterward, he was diplomatic when he learned that his signature policy might be in jeopardy.
"He doesn't have to be convinced by me," Mr. Kemp said. "I think he's going to be convinced by the residents themselves." About 250 tenant groups are in the stages of planning to buy their homes, but only one has signed a purchase agreement since the program begin in 1991.
Mr. Cisneros, the former Mayor of San Antonio, spoke approvingly of the community development block grant program, which allows mayors wide latitude in spending Federal money. But he criticized the Administration's budget office, saying it was holding up $2.5 billion for low-income housing because of disputes over regulations.

H.U.D. Choice Wary of Selling Public Housing;
Bentsen Promises Focus on Deficit

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, President-elect Bill Clinton's choice for Treasury Secretary, joined a parade of appointees today in declaring that new forecasts of higher budget deficits would make it harder for Mr. Clinton to cut taxes for the middle class as he promised during the campaign.
Mr. Bentsen, who Mr. Clinton says will be his chief spokesman on economic matters, vowed to focus on cutting the budget deficit, saying that to achieve this goal, taxes would have to rise, spending would have to fall and growth would have to accelerate. 
 In a confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, which he headed for six years as a Texas Democrat, Mr. Bentsen added his voice to that of other Clinton aides who said the tax cuts for families earning less than $80,000 a year were being reconsidered.
Under gentle questioning from his colleagues, Mr. Bentsen suggested that one way to cut the deficit would be to hire more auditors to increase tax collections. He also said Mr. Clinton's advisers were considering a gasoline tax and accelerating plans to set an older age limit for receiving Social Security benefits.
Notwithstanding his vow to reduce the deficit over the long term, Mr. Bentsen left the door open to increased spending to spur the economy right away, saying the growth rate expected for this year would not be enough to make a large dent in the jobless rate.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, served as chairman of the committee today. In an unusual move, he asked the committee to vote to send the nomination to the full Senate even before Mr. Bentsen had answered any questions. Mr. Moynihan asked for a vote as soon as he saw there was a quorum -- and the vote was unanimous.

DAMON STOCK PLUNGES ON EARNINGS PROJECTION

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
Stock of the Damon Corporation lost nearly a third of its value yesterday after the laboratory testing company said it expected to report fourth-quarter results well below Wall Street estimates. Damon closed down $5.75 a share, or 28.9 percent, to $14.125, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. More than a million shares changed hands, representing 6 percent of Damon's stock outstanding. 
 Damon, based in Needham Heights, Mass., said fourth-quarter earnings and sales would be higher than 1991 levels but below expectations in part because of economic weakness in California and New England. Damon, which specializes in preventive health screening, AIDS testing and substance-abuse testing, also cited competitive pricing pressure and reduced sales during the dissolutions of join ventures in Michigan and Northern California.

HEADLINE: A Missed Opportunity on City Labor

 BODY:
Mayor David Dinkins said that in this round of labor negotiations, he'd see to it that New York City's labor unions agreed to substantive reforms. Now he has abandoned that promise. The tentative agreement with several municipal unions is, to the administration's credit, financially responsible. But it also represents a missed opportunity to begin restructuring the work force.
The pact grants a wage and benefit increase of 8.2 percent over 39 months, more than the city budgeted for, but below inflation. Yet despite Mr. Dinkins's long-term pledge to grant increases only if the unions paid for them in better productivity, the agreement does not impose even one reform. Isn't money saved money saved, whether through reforms or a modest settlement? No, because real reforms can last generations, not just the length of a contract. That's why unions fight them so fiercely. 
 Administration negotiators say they were convinced that if forced to accept productivity gains, the unions would have balked and opted for binding arbitration that might not favor the city. But it is also possible that if City Hall had stood firm, the unions might have caved. Or arbitrators might have supported the city.
However disappointing, the settlement comes as no surprise, given Mr. Dinkins's non-confrontational nature and his politics. Unlike Mayor Edward Rendell of Philadelphia, who took on his city's unions after running on a reform platform, Mayor Dinkins was the candidate of municipal unions, and is up for re-election this year. The last thing he needs is labor strife.
But what of New York City's needs? A more productive work force would save money that could help the poor and other New Yorkers now coping with services cut because of the economy and to finance the ambitious police expansion plan.
There is certainly substantial room for labor improvement. Why should city workers get 12 paid holidays when Federal workers get 10? Why should the city tolerate work rules that result in three people doing the job of one? Why should some workers get unlimited sick leave?
Those and other matters will go to a three-member panel for more talks and maybe arbitration. But with the contract settled, there isn't much pressure on that panel to produce. After it settled with sanitation workers -- some of whom work four hours a day but are paid for eight -- the city promised to negotiate work rule changes within a month or two. That was 11 months ago.
The Dinkins administration inherited a bad economy and a labor force accustomed to gentle treatment from City Hall. Even mayors who promised reform did little. This time there seemed a chance to seize the moment because the city's fiscal woes created momentum for structural reform. The new settlement makes clear that the moment has passed. The city has a responsible labor settlement in fiscal terms, but City Hall has once again resorted to business as usual.

HEADLINE: More Questions for Ron Brown

 BODY:
Wake-up calls come from unexpected sources, and sometimes they can rock the sleep of ages. Consider the case of Senator Trent Lott, the Mississippi Republican whose somnolent interrogation of Ron Brown last Wednesday took Southern hospitality to new levels of languidity.
Now a few solid questions have entered Mr. Lott's mind about potential conflicts of interest between Mr. Brown's work at the law and lobbying firm of Patton, Boggs & Blow and the new duties he wants to assume on Jan. 20 as Secretary of Commerce. A larger question is whether Mr. Lott can now wake the slumbering Senate. 
 Mr. Lott's inquiries, in a letter to Mr. Brown last Friday, have to do with the very limited promise of recusal that Mr. Brown has proposed. The Senator writes that, in confidential documents submitted to the Commerce Committee, Mr. Brown listed only six clients represented in 10 years at the law firm.
"Did you not participate as a member of the firm in providing services to any other clients," Mr. Lott asks, and "if so, what representations were made by you or the firm regarding your future involvement with those clients or their interests?"
Mr. Lott has asked precisely the right questions, and without answers the Senate cannot confidently vote to confirm. But those questions do not go far enough. At a time when trade with Japanese and other competitors is a pressing political and economic issue, the Senate has an obligation to obtain the full list of Mr. Brown's clients, and the public has a right to look at it.
There is healthy precedent for such disclosure. When Carla Hills became U.S. Trade Representative, she publicly identified three clients she had personally represented in matters relating to her new post and recused herself from dealing with them for the entirety of her term and with her law firm's clients for a year.
It may be that Mr. Brown will feel duty bound not to identify his foreign and corporate clients. If so, his clients' rights must be respected. But the Senate and the public have an even stronger interest in full disclosure. If he can't comply, it may be that this is not the right job for Mr. Brown.
Mr. Lott also requested more information about the $1 million farewell payment coming to Mr. Brown from Patton, Boggs & Blow under his partnership agreement with the firm. Despite the handsome handshake, Mr. Brown proposes to recuse himself for only one year from issues he handled recently for specified clients of the firm and not to recuse himself at all from dealing with other Patton, Boggs clients.
It is the curtain of uncertainty that Mr. Brown has raised with his narrow, limited recusal policy that Senator Lott is trying with his questions to part. Mr. Lott requests a copy of the partnership agreement and more information about the amount and schedule of payments. The Senator sensibly finds that otherwise "There is no way to be confident that your narrow recusal policy vis-a-vis Patton, Boggs & Blow will be sufficient to remove any conflict of interest problems or the appearance of any conflict of interest problems."
Finally, Mr. Lott asks for a fuller account of whether Mr. Brown handled "soft corporate contributions" to the Democratic Party and how he will handle contacts with his son, who works for a lobbying firm with Japanese clients. The issue of Mr. Brown's independence from business became more pointed yesterday with the Los Angeles Times report that J. C. Penney, Anheuser Busch, Pepsico, Textron and Sony Music Entertainment had been asked to give at least $10,000 apiece for a "Friends of Ron Brown" party during the inaugural.
Elsewhere on this page is a letter from the Clinton campaign spokesman, George Stephanopoulos, that praises Mr. Brown's decision to terminate his relationship with Patton, Boggs & Blow and notes that Clinton appointees will refrain from lobbying for five years after leaving office.
Mr. Stephanopoulos avoids the point. The propriety of Mr. Brown's separation cannot properly be judged -- by the Office of Government Ethics, the Commerce Department, the Senate or the public -- without the financial and legal details requested by Senator Lott.
What Mr. Brown does after leaving office is not relevant to the current discussion of how he will handle potential conflicts while in office. Asking for such information is never an insult to a nominee's integrity. It honors a legitimate public concern.
Nowhere in his campaign did Mr. Clinton say he would ask the voters to take a leap of faith about the financial interests of his nominees. Instead he proposed a new, stricter standard "to take away power from the entrenched bureaucracies and special interests that dominate Washington." The Senate should not confirm any nominee until that nominee and the President-elect have provided evidence that the pledge is being met in every reasonable way.
Mr. Lott is correct that Mr. Brown has not yet met that standard. The Senator is entitled to the additional information he seeks, and the public deserves to read over his shoulder.

HEADLINE: Somalia Will Need Help When Troops Go

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Governments around the world need to recognize that starvation in Somalia can only be eliminated by a long-term program of environmental rehabilitation of the land. 
 The Horn of Africa has been the site of three major famines in the last 20 years. These famines are not acts of God, but rather the result of a systematic destruction of the natural resource base.
We should all be concerned that the almost exclusive focus of short-term relief in Somalia misses essential actions necessary to prevent the recurrence of this type of tragedy and to enable the people of Somalia to feed themselves.
Well before the current tragedy in Somalia and the departure of the dictator Siad Barre, there had been repeated warnings about the food shortage crisis facing many African countries. The 1988 World Bank task force on food security in Africa estimated that 2.3 million Somalis, which is about 42 percent of the population, did not have enough food. The report stated that more than 40 percent of the populations of Somalia, Uganda, Chad and Mozambique suffered from a food shortage.
In 1984 and 1985 it is estimated that more than a million Africans died of malnutrition and related diseases, primarily in Ethiopa, Sudan, Somalia, Niger, Mali, Mozambique and Chad. The World Resources Institute noted that the food crisis of the 1980's in Africa showed little had changed:
"Both the famine and the relief effort were haunting repetitions of a similar catastrophe that struck the continent in 1973-74. Although the recent relief campaign was bigger [and] better-coordinated . . . the agricultural debacle was stark proof that, on the policy level, little had been learned since the previous famine."
Countries involved in the relief effort must discuss a long-term strategy that addresses the root causes of hunger and its connection to destruction of the natural resource base. Something must be done about the state of lawlessness in Somalia, but the challenges to put the country back on its feet are much greater than a mission of a few months' duration.
Unless something is done about desertification and the destruction of the natural resource base, the world will continue to witness massive starvation episodes. The United States dealt with the Dust Bowl through a comprehensive control of soil erosion. This sort of effort is needed in Somalia and other parts of Africa.
Such a land and water restoration program needs to be significantly different from the large engineering projects that are typically financed by institutions like the World Bank, African Development Bank and European bilateral assistance. Effort must be made to control soil erosion and rehabilitate and revegetate dry lands.

Closed Doors in Dallas
 Routh Street Cafe in Dallas, which opened in 1983 and had been one of the city's most highly regarded restaurants, closed a week ago, a casualty attributed to the economy. Stephan Pyles, the chef and co-owner, said that business had been slightly off but that "costs have been skyrocketing, especially workman's compensation, and that made it impossible to make ends meet."
Baby Routh, the more informal restaurant that opened opposite Routh Street Cafe in 1986, will stay open.
 
Cooking Class Discount
 Karen Lee, the cookbook author, teacher and caterer whose recipes combine Asian, European and American influences, has scheduled a series of cooking courses at a 20 percent discount. Through March, a series of four classes will be $320 instead of $400.
The classes are full-participation sessions for a limited number of students. A full meal with wine, prepared by the students, is served. Miss Lee said that her cooking currently emphasizes low-fat dishes.
The classes are held at 142 West End Avenue (66th Street). For information: (212) 787-2227.
 
Cooking and Dancing
 A flamenco interpretation of the novel "Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands" by Jorge Amado that has the heroine describing recipes as she cooks onstage is being presented at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue (19th Street).

Tickets are $22. Performances are scheduled for Tuesday through Jan. 23 at 8 P.M., and on Jan. 24 at 7:30 P.M., with matinees on Jan. 23 and 24 at 2 P.M. For information and reservations: (212) 242-0800.
 
Brooklyn Lusciousness
 Lynne and Jean-Pierre Guillot, who own the splendid Marquet Patisserie at 235 Smith Street in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, have opened a Manhattan outpost at 15 East 12th Street. The new shop sells the fine French pastries and breads made in the Brooklyn store. The bright, airy but narrow shop has a few temporary tables in front and back.
The mouth-watering display provides ample adornment. There are individual chocolate-glazed pastries and fresh fruit tarts, mostly $2.75 each. Among the buttery breakfast pastries is a swirl with prunes ($1.50) and a slice of toasted brioche with almonds ($1.50).
The homey but delicious tarte paysanne made with sauteed apples flavored with Calvados is $3 in the individual size. A lush tarte Normande combining crisp pastry, apples, tender meringue and caramel is $20 for the six-inch size.
The prices in Manhattan are 15 to 20 percent higher than in Brooklyn. Marquet Patisserie is open Monday through Friday, 8 A.M. to 7 P.M.; Saturday, 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. Telephone: (212) 229-9313.

HEADLINE: Governor Ties Environment to Economy

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
In his State of the State speech today, Gov. Jim Florio outlined a program calculated to turn New Jersey into a world center for environmental technology and position himself as the leader of its economic revival.
Reaching out to opposition Republicans who dominate the Legislature, the Governor -- who faces a long-odds fight for re-election -- repeatedly invoked compromise as the new political order in Trenton. But he also said there were some issues on which he would not yield, including a stiff ban on semiautomatic weapons. 
 Republican leaders gave the Governor's third State of the State address generally favorable reviews on both his calls for cooperation and his focus on stimulating the economy. But a handful of legislators from both parties raised questions about how many of the Governor's proposals could be turned into reality at a time the state is struggling to extricate itself from economic recession.
The Governor, who is struggling to dispel resentment over the $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990, made it clear that new taxes were not an answer in a year in which he and all 120 legislators must face the voters.
 
Heeding Advice
 Although the Governor's aides described the annual address as nonpolitical, Mr. Florio alluded to his parlous political standing when he recalled the advice of a former Governor, Richard Hughes, who said: "Accommodate wherever you can, but never compromise on principle."
"Well, believe me," Mr. Florio said, "when a two-term Governor offers advice, I listen."
The allusion evoked one of the themes that Mr. Florio will use in fighting for re-election: that he did what he thought was necessary even though it was politically unpopular.
The call for the development of environmental technology was the key new initiative in a speech whose contents had been doled out over several days. The initiative would be a part of a continued program of high-tech research and development initiatives and industrial development to create jobs and position the state for future economic growth.
 
Looking to New Jersey
 "Today, when people around the world think of pharmaceuticals, when they think of telecommunications, when they think of photonics, they think of New Jersey," he said. "Tomorrow, when people in Eastern Europe want to make the polluted Danube River blue again, when people in Ukraine want to clean up Chernobyl, they will need environmental technology -- and they will look to New Jersey."
Some elements of the program, like the plan to offer tax incentives to companies that create jobs and job training by investing in environmental technology, seem certain to win legislative approval, said the Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco.
Other proposals, like dedicating part of the state's Economic Recovery Fund to environmental technology, could be carried out by executive order, Mr. DiFrancesco said.
Besides the focus on environmental technology, the Governor called for an accelerated $1 billion program of capital improvements to assist local governments in building roads, public buildings, sewer systems and other infrastructure projects the Governor said would create 30,000 jobs.
 
'New Jersey Works'
 Even the invocation that opened the session of the Legislature at which the Governor delivered his annual message resonated with the theme of economic development, as the Rev. Ollice Bates of Mount Zion Baptist Church in Salem invoked spiritual guidance to insure that "New Jersey Works," echoing the economic development slogan.
In an election year when voters are hungry for assurances of economic stability, there was repeated applause for the Governor's twin themes of cooperation and jobs.
"How can you disagree when you're talking about jobs for New Jersey?" said Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian. "How can you disagree when you're talking about trying to shore up the infrastructure?"
But until recently, with compromises on health care and education aid, disagreement has been the order of the day since the Republicans seized control of both houses of the Legislature. Last year, for the first time in the history of the state, a Governor vetoed a budget approved by the Legislature, and was then overridden. The same thing happened with the Legislature's repeal of the one-cent increase in sales taxes the Governor and the Democrats imposed in 1990.
 
The Real Enemies
 "No offense, Mr. Speaker and Mr. President," the Governor said today, "but I was afraid we might spend the next two years fighting each other instead of fighting the recession and fighting for a better New Jersey."
The Governor's call for bipartisan cooperation was universally applauded, but there were differences of opinion on how long it would last.
Not too long, said former Assemblyman Robert D. Franks, who was the Republican State Chairman until he was sworn in this month as a member of the United States House of Representatives.
He predicted that the era of good feelings will end by June, when Republicans choose a gubernatorial candidate in their primary. "You don't beat an incumbent without pulling together and the Republicans in the Legislature will pull together against Jim Florio," Mr. Franks said.
 
Spirit of Cooperation
 But if Mr. Florio does get a bipartisan honeymoon until the June primary, when Republicans are likely to choose either Christine Todd Whitman or W. Cary Edwards as their candidate, that will give him more than five months of grace to get a budget in place and get his economic initiatives into motion.
State Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., Republican of Middletown, said the bipartisan spirit of cooperation might last even beyond primary day.
"To the general public," Mr. Kyrillos said, "it's not the Governor's law, or the Legislature's law that gets passed or defeated, it's just 'those guys down in Trenton.' It is in nobody's interest to fail because of partisan gridlock.
"Hopefully, we will be able to play politics in one arena and govern in the other arena."
 
Republican Front-Runner
 Unsurprisingly, Mrs. Whitman, considered the front-runner for the Republican nomination on the strength of her near-upset of Bill Bradley in the Senate race in 1990, seemed in no mood for conciliation.
"Those of us concerned about Governor Florio's high taxes, increased government spending and lack of priorities found little indication in today's speech that he has seen the error of her ways," she said.
Mr. Edwards was likewise skeptical. "This is Jim Florio the candidate, just like Jim Florio the candidate in 1989, not the Jim Florio we have known these past three years," he said. "History tells us that should Jim Florio win re-election, the real Jim Florio will emerge again."
The Governor's speech got better reviews from John Budzash, a founder of the antitax group Hands Across New Jersey that was instrumental in organizing an outpouring of opposition to the Governor that helped rout the Democratic Legislature a year ago.
Though he took issue with some things Mr. Florio said today, Mr. Budzash said he might vote for the Governor in November. "I would consider it," said Mr. Budzash, "and that's progress for the Governor."

HEADLINE: Hans Loewald, 86; Professor Emeritus In Psychiatry at Yale

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Dr. Hans W. Loewald, clinical professor emeritus in psychiatry at Yale University, died on Saturday at Whitney Manor in Hamden, Conn. He was 86 and lived in Hamden.
 He died after a long illness, his family said. 
Dr. Loewald was a psychoanalyst practicing in New Haven until he retired four years ago.
 Until he retired, he taught at the department of psychiatry of Yale Medical School and the Yale Child Study Center.
 
Joined Yale Faculty in 1955
 A native of the Alsatian town of Colmar, Dr. Loewald received his medical training in Germany and served his internship in Berlin. He received a medical degree from the University of Rome in 1934 and practiced psychiatry in Padua until 1939, when he brought his family to the United States.
 He trained in psychiatry at Rhode Island State Hospital and in child guidance at the University of Maryland Hospital. He was an assistant professor in psychiatry at the university's Medical School in Baltimore from 1945 to 1955, the year he joined the Yale faculty as an associate clinical professor in psychiatry.
 In 1955, he also became a training analyst and member of the education committee of the Western New England Institute for Psychoanalysis in New Haven. He was a past chairman and former president of the institute, and reached full professorship at Yale in 1972.
 His many honors included the Mary S. Sigourney Fund Award in 1991 for significant psychoanalytic contributions, and the Laughlin Award presented to him last year by the American College of Psychoanalysis.
 Dr. Loewald is survived by his wife of 39 years, the former Elizabeth Longshore, a psychiatrist; a son, Francis, of South Salem, N.Y.; two daughters, Katherine Loewald of Brooklyn, and Caroline Loewald of New Haven, and three grandsons.

HEADLINE: Diana Adams, Leading Ballerina And Dance Educator, Dies at 66

BYLINE: By JACK ANDERSON

 BODY:
Diana Adams, who was a leading ballerina with both the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater and the former dean of students at the School of American Ballet, died on Sunday at Mark Twain-St. Joseph's Hospital in San Andreas, Calif. She was 66 and lived in Arnold, Calif.
Miss Adams was one of George Balanchine's favorite dancers and created roles in many of his major ballets of the 1950's. Among her most complex parts was the almost fiendishly demanding pas de deux she danced with Arthur Mitchell in the Balanchine-Stravinsky "Agon" in 1957. Mr. Mitchell later said of the duet and its unusual pivots and balances, "Diana's nervous intensity made the whole pas de deux work because it's not so much the difficulty of the steps or how flexible you are, it's the precariousness." 
She also appeared in films, performing with Danny Kaye in "Knock on Wood" (1954) and in "Invitation to the Dance" (1956), directed by Gene Kelly.
 
A Versatile Talent
 Miss Adams was born in Staunton, Va. Her family later moved to New York City, and she studied there at Ballet Arts School, where one of her teachers was Agnes de Mille. Miss Adams made her stage debut in 1943 in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical "Oklahoma!," choreographed by Miss de Mille. In 1944, she joined Ballet Theater, as American Ballet Theater was then known.
 Her talent and versatility were soon recognized. She performed the title role in David Lichine's comic "Helen of Troy," was the malevolent Queen of the Wilis in "Giselle," and was praised for her poignancy in Antony Tudor's bittersweet "Jardin aux Lilas" and for her ferocity in "Undertow," Tudor's ballet about slum life. In 1948, she created the role of the mother in Miss de Mille's "Fall River Legend."
She joined the New York City Ballet in 1950 and performed with it until 1963. She had a remarkable interpretative range and was as compelling in Balanchine'sabstractions as she was in Tudor's dance-dramas. John Martin wrote in The New York Times in 1951 that under Balanchine's guidance, Miss Adams "has become theepitome of the lyric dancer."
 In addition to "Agon," she danced leading roles in the premieres of Tudor's "Lady of the Camellias" (1951), Frederick Ashton's "Picnic at Tintagel" (1952), and important Balanchine creations including "Caracole" (1952), "Opus 34" (1954), "Episodes" (1959) and "Liebeslieder Walzer" (1960).
 
Transition Into Teaching
 She began teaching at the School of American Ballet while still a member of the company. After she stopped dancing, she served as dean of students at Balanchine's request until she retired in 1971. It was Miss Adams who chose the teen-age Suzanne Farrell at a School of American Ballet audition in 1960.
 Miss Adams married the dancer Hugh Laing in 1947; they were divorced in 1953. Her second marriage, to the stage manager and lighting designer Ronald Bates, also ended in divorce. In recent years, Miss Adams lived quietly in retirement, although she did teach for several companies, including the State Ballet of Missouri, which is directed by Todd Bolender, one of her former colleagues at the New York City Ballet.
 She is survived by a daughter, Georgina Bates of Antioch, Calif.

HEADLINE: Tad Danielewski, An Acting Teacher And a Director, 71

 BODY:
Tad Danielewski, a theater, film and television director and acting teacher, died last Wednesday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 71.
 He died of cancer, his family said. 
Throughout his long career Mr. Danielewski was dedicated to the training of actors. He established the Tad Danielewski Actors' Workshop in New York in the late 1950's, and a branch in Los Angeles some 20 years later. Among his students were James Earl Jones, Mercedes Ruehl, Martin Sheen and Sigourney Weaver.
 Born in Poland on March 29, 1921, Mr. Danielewski spent a year in a Nazi labor camp during World War II. After the war he directed more than two dozen plays for the Polish and British army theaters, and studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London.
 
A Director on 'Omnibus'
 He moved to the United States in 1948, attended Ohio State University, and began his American career as a television director. In the mid-1950's he directed more than 20 features for the "Omnibus" series on CBS, and then became head of new program development for NBC.
 He was a producer and director of "Africa," a four-hour Emmy Award-winning documentary that was telecast by ABC during the 1967-68 season.
 In 1957 Mr. Danielewski founded Stratton Productions, a company that staged many productions in New York, Los Angeles and London. He collaborated with Pearl S. Buck on several projects, including "The Guide," a film about India. In 1962 he directed a film version of Jean-Paul Sartre's "No Exit" that starred Viveca Lindfors, Rita Gam and Morgan Sterne.
He was a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Directors Guild of America, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers.
 He is survived by his wife, Lillian D'Arc; two sons, Mark, of Los Angeles, and Christopher, of Manhattan, and a daughter, Annie, of Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: Phyllis Wallace, 69, A Labor Economist In A.T.&T. Lawsuit

BYLINE: By LEE A. DANIELS

 BODY:
Phyllis A. Wallace, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, died last weekend at her home in Boston. She was 69.
 Officials at M.I.T. said yesterday that she had died of natural causes. 
Dr. Wallace was Professor Emerita of Management at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T. In a career that spanned nearly four decades, she achieved distinction in a field in which there were few women.
 In the early 1970's she directed studies for a Federal lawsuit charging the American Telephone & Telegraph Company, then the largest private employer in the United States, with racial and sexual discrimination. The suit led to a 1973 decision that found the company guilty of discrimination and produced significant changes in its employment practices.
 
Two Funds in Her Honor
 Her book, "Equal Employment Opportunity and the A.T.&T. Case," published in 1976 by the M.I.T. Press, discussed the strategy and importance of the case.
 Dr. Wallace retired in 1986. The Sloan School endowed two funds in her honor to support black doctoral candidates and black visiting scholars at the school.
 She was born in Baltimore, and received a bachelor's degree from New York University in 1943 and a master's and doctorate from Yale University in 1944 and 1948, respectively.
 Early in her career she taught at the City College of New York and at Atlanta University, and worked for the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Her appointment at the Sloan School in 1975 made her the first woman to gain tenure on its faculty.
 She is survived by her mother, Stevella Wallace; a brother, Samuel Wallace, and three sisters, Lydia Mills, Ophelia Wallace and Margaret Campbell, all of Baltimore.

HEADLINE: RAID ON IRAQ;
U.S. AND ALLIED PLANES HIT IRAQ, BOMBING MISSILE SITES IN SOUTH IN REPLY TO HUSSEIN'S DEFIANCE

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Warplanes from the United States, France and Britain bombed missile sites in southern Iraq today, two years after the allies claimed to have decisively defeated President Saddam Hussein in the Persian Gulf war and just a week before President Bush is scheduled to leave office.
The 30-minute night attack, limited in scope and in duration, was clearly intended to deliver a political message of allied resolve in the face of Iraqi defiance and not a crushing military blow. 
 About 80 strike aircraft and about 30 support planes took part. No economic targets like power stations or warehouses were hit, nor did bombs rain on airfields or on major cities as they did during the war.
 
Iraq Offers to Halt Incursions

 Having withstood a merciless pounding in 1991, it was not clear why Mr. Hussein would buckle in his resolve in the face of much less punishment now, especially since the attack took place in remote areas, far from the view of most Iraqi citizens.
Indeed, he breathed defiance in a broadcast tonight, urging the "falcons" of his air force to fight the allies "the way you fought God's enemies before."
At the same time, Iraq offered to halt its raids into Kuwait. They have been taking place for several days and were a violation of United Nations resolutions. Iraq has also deployed missile batteries in forbidden areas and fired an Iraqi missile at an American plane, actions the United States has described as brazen provocations by Baghdad.
 
1,250 Troops Sent to Kuwait
 In a further warning to Mr. Hussein that he could not continue to flout the will of the United Nations, Mr. Bush announced the dispatch of a battalion-sized task force, composed of about 1,250 American troops, to neighboring Kuwait, where they will act as a deterrent to further Iraqi incursions.
"I would think that soon Saddam Hussein would understand that we mean what we say and that we back it up," the President said in a meeting with reporters, brushing aside any suggestion that it was improper for him to launch an attack with so little time left in office. He implied, and officials in Paris and London said more bluntly, that if the Iraqi leader did not mend his ways, there would be more attacks.
"If he infringes again, he must expect us to retaliate again," Prime Minister John Major of Britain said. "We have made it clear to him that we will certainly do that."
President-elect Bill Clinton, who was briefed on the raids and supported them, said in Little Rock, Ark., that "it was the right decision, done in the right way." He added in an interview that he hoped Mr. Hussein would change his policies so a new leaf in relations between Baghdad and Washington could be turned on Jan. 20.
All the strike aircraft, which operated mainly from airfields in Saudi Arabia and from the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk in the Persian Gulf, returned safely, and there were no allied casualties, Pentagon officials said. Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said early reports indicated that "the mission was accomplished."
 
'Systematically Destroyed'
 A Navy Intruder pilot, Comdr. Rick Hess of the 52d Attack Squadron, based at Whidbey Island, Wash., said the missiles he had struck, which were in position to imperil allied aircraft patrolling the air-exclusion zone in southern Iraq, had been "systematically destroyed."
United States pilots, who were joined by British airmen in Tornadoes and Frenchmen at the controls of Mirages, said they flew through skies lit by the orange splashes of antiaircraft fire. Several said they made double passes over the targets before dropping their bombs to make sure they had correctly identified the targets.
Reports from the Kitty Hawk said at least four surface-to-air missiles had been fired at the American planes. But they were apparently launched at random, without the benefit of the crucial guidance supplied by radar.
Intelligence specialists and military analysts said most of the missiles based in southern Iraq were obsolete and could easily be replaced by more modern Soviet-built weapons that are kept in reserve near Baghdad. But the allied bombs also hit control bunkers and radar units, using high-speed anti-radiation missiles that home in on radar beacons, and that may prove to be of more significance.
"This takes out his ability to control his aircraft south of the 32d parallel," where the air-exclusion zone begins, exulted Comdr. Kevin Thomas, commander of an A-18 Hornet squadron on the Kitty Hawk. "It was like a big laser light show."
The troops headed for Kuwait will be drawn from the Army First Cavalry Division, based at Fort Hood, Tex., and will join 300 special operations force troops who are already there some time later this month. The division saw extensive action in the Vietnam war and in the campaign in the gulf.
For Mr. Bush, it was an oddly aggressive start to his final week in office. Never in recent American history has an outgoing President initiated a military attack so close to his date of departure; more often, lame ducks in the White House have sought to make peace. For example, Harry S. Truman left the Oval Office in the midst of talks on ending the Korean War, and Lyndon B. Johnson ordered a bombing halt in a vain effort to end the war in Vietnam.
But Mr. Bush, who according to his aides had been weighing an armed response to Mr. Hussein for months, said he had no reservations at all about the course he had decided upon.
"You got to do what you have to do," the President said, "and there should be no question about that. I'm President until the 20th, and I will run the foreign policy and conduct these -- make these kinds of decisions as long as I am President."
The Pentagon said the attacks in Iraq, which won the support of virtually all major figures on Capitol Hill and most leaders abroad, began at 6:45 P.M., Baghdad time, 10:45 A.M. Eastern time.
 
Laser-Guided Bombs
 In addition to the anti-radar missiles, the allied planes dropped laser-guided bombs as well as conventional munitions, senior officers said.
Conspicuous by their absence from the strike force were planes from Arab nations, which took part in the gulf war. According to some accounts, Saudi refueling planes did play a support role, orbiting just outside Iraqi airspace. Some Arab leaders have voiced skepticism about the course of recent allied policy in the gulf.
Gen. Joseph Hoar, commander of the United States Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base, near Tampa, Fla., who had overall charge of the operation, said all the targets were below or close to the 32d parallel. He said they included radar sites at Tallil air base near Nasiriya, and also at Samawa, Najaf and Al Amara. Mobile missile sites in the general area of Tallil and Basra were also struck, according to the general.
 
Saudi Sensitivities
 General Hoar said during a briefing in Florida that he had monitored progress in the raids over an open phone line to the United States commander on the spot, Maj. Gen. James Record of the Air Force. General Record was reportedly in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, but United States officials said as little as possible about that country because of Saudi sensitivities.
The strike force included F-117 Stealth bombers, F-16's, F-15's and
F-18's, as well as tankers, Awacs radar planes, reconnaissance planes and helicopters.
"It was well crafted, a pin-point strike," a briefer at the Pentagon said, speaking under ground rules that forbade reporters to identify him. "It was designed to send a crystal-clear message."
But Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said on the "MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour" that "the restrained and modest option" had been chosen to deliver that message. Other options existed, including target lists of much wider scope. It was not clear why those options had been rejected.
 
Missiles Were Not Returned
 Last Saturday, the White House said Iraq had "backed down" in response to an ultimatum by dispersing its missiles that had been placed in the southern zone, where allied planes patrol to enforce a ban on Iraqi military flights. They presented it as a victory in the latest showdown with Mr. Hussein.
But the missiles were never returned to their original bases, as the allies had demanded. When asked about this, the Bush administration called it a mere technicality and said the missiles were no longer a threat.
Today, Mr. Fitzwater told a different story. "After initially responding to the terms of the Jan. 6 warning," he said, "Iraq violated its requirements and the coalition is acting to restore an environment that poses no threat to coalition aircraft." In between, there was no major change in the status of the missiles in the South.
But Mr. Hussein angered the President and his allies by sending missiles to a northern zone where they are also forbidden and dispatching troops into territory that the allies have given to Kuwait, where they took back weapons that had been sized in 1991. Notable among those weapons were several Chinese-made Silkworm missiles.

HEADLINE: Letterman Appears Certain To Move to CBS From NBC

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
David Letterman is all but certain to accept CBS's offer to move his show from NBC, probably starting in late summer, officials at both networks said yesterday.
The end of Mr. Letterman's negotiations with NBC set off a storm of conflicting reports about how far the network had gone in its effort to keep Mr. Letterman. Four executives close to the talks said yesterday that as recently as last weekend NBC had discussed with Mr. Letterman's representatives the possibility of having him replace Jay Leno as host of "Tonight." They said Mr. Letterman rejected the idea because NBC was not willing to match the financial arrangements of the CBS offer. 
 NBC executives angrily asserted that they had not offered the "Tonight" job to Mr. Letterman. They suggested that the entertainer's supporters were trying to concoct a story to counter the impression that Mr. Letterman had lost out to Mr. Leno once again.
The CBS offer, previously reported to be about $28 million over two years, is actually a three-year offer for about $42 million in salary and incentives, a senior network executive said. Mr. Letterman's CBS show will run from 11:30 P.M. to 12:30 A.M. Eastern time, Monday through Friday, pitting him against Mr. Leno.
The executives from both sides, all speaking on condition of anonymity, agreed that NBC had not found a way to match the CBS offer. Although under the terms of Mr. Letterman's contract NBC has until midnight tomorrow to match the CBS offer, a senior NBC executive said with finality today, "We tried to put something together that would keep both guys here, but we failed."
NBC has scheduled a news conference today in Santa Monica, Calif. to announce its decision to keep Mr. Leno as host of "Tonight" and to acknowledge that Mr. Letterman will leave the network after 11 years there.
Mr. Letterman must continue to do his show at NBC until June 25; it is unclear how soon thereafter he will start at CBS, but a senior CBS executive said that the network would like to have the show start before the beginning of the fall television season.
It is also unclear whether Mr. Letterman will move the show to Los Angeles, where celebrity guests are more plentiful, or stay in New York, which has given the show much of its flavor.
NBC executives said the network hoped to fill the Letterman vacancy by creating a 12:30 A.M. talk show for Dana Carvey, one of the stars of "Saturday Night Live." A network executive said that Mr. Carvey might not want to do a late-night show, but that the network was still hoping to persuade him.
Mr. Letterman has made his displeasure with NBC public since June 1991, when the network named Mr. Leno to replace the longtime host of "Tonight," Johnny Carson, who retired last year. Mr. Letterman hired Michael Ovitz, the chairman of Hollywood's most powerful talent representatives, Creative Artists Agency, to solicit offers from other networks and syndicators.
Mr. Letterman accepted the CBS offer in December; according to the terms of his contract with NBC, that network has until tomorrow to match the offer or release him.
Efforts to reach Mr. Letterman, Mr. Leno and Mr. Ovitz for comment were unsuccessful.
NBC officials refused to comment for attribution. They said that Warren Littlefield, the president of NBC Entertainment, would discuss the entire situation at the news conference today in Santa Monica, where television critics have gathered this week to meet with broadcasting executives and hear about the networks' new shows.
Executives close to Mr. Letterman said that his chief goal throughout the negotiations had been to stay at NBC, as host of "Tonight."
"David wanted two things," a senior entertainment-industry executive close to the negotiations said. "He wanted the 'Tonight' job, and he wanted to be able to win at 11:30. He knew his best chance to do that was on the 'Tonight' show."
Still, the executive said, Mr. Letterman and his representatives were unhappy with NBC's discussions about the "Tonight" show last weekend. Describing the NBC position, the executive said: "There were two main requirements. One would be that Dave was willing to delay taking over the show until Jan. 1 of next year. The other was that he would accept a lot less money in salary and that the production fees that CBS had promised to the staff of the show would be much less." The executive said the difference was about $4 million a year.
The reason for seeking the delay, the executive said, was to allow NBC to evade part of its obligation to pay Mr. Leno a penalty fee if he is removed from the "Tonight" show before his contract runs out.
The executive said NBC would have been obligated to pay Mr. Leno between $16 and $18 million if he had been replaced immediately. "But if they got Letterman to go for the delay until January, the penalty could have been more than cut in half," he said.
 
A Money-Saving Bolt
 If Mr. Leno had decided to quit rather than stay on as a lame duck, the executive said, "NBC wouldn't have had to pay him anything." Two weeks ago Mr. Leno, angry about receiving no firm support from NBC in New York while the network deliberated, had threatened to "be out the door" if the decision was made to replace him with Mr. Letterman.
The entertainment-industry executive said: "Economics drove the whole thing. You have to remember that for NBC, this was a matter of losing one of two shows. CBS could afford to pay more because it was creating a new franchise. NBC wanted to limit the damage. The problem really was that CBS made the deal too rich."
Three other executives with ties to the negotiations confirmed the details of last weekend's discussions about the "Tonight" show and said that Mr. Letterman and his staff had met to discuss it.
One executive said: "They weren't looking for Letterman to take over the 'Tonight' show. They were looking for him to take over the Jay Leno show."
But NBC executives said no offer for Mr. Letterman to replace Mr. Leno had ever been made. "Never, ever, never," a senior executive said. "Not an offer, not a shading of an offer. It is absolutely not true."
The NBC executive charged that the story of the offer to Mr. Letterman was a fabrication timed by people close to him to undercut NBC's decision to keep Mr. Leno.
Indeed, even the entertainment executive who described the details of the NBC discussions about having Mr. Letterman take over the "Tonight" show said that Mr. Leno had been extremely skillful in regaining support among some NBC officials through his statements to the press, his contacts with NBC affiliate stations in the past few weeks, and more polished performances.
 
Advantages of Underdogdom
 "Jay got himself painted as the battling underdog, and it worked very well," the executive said.
If NBC had replaced Mr. Leno with Mr. Letterman, the tone of the "Tonight" show, which has been one of the network's crown jewels for four decades, would probably have undergone a striking change. Mr. Leno's style of humor, while occasionally barbed, is more conventional than Mr. Letterman's, and his on-air demeanor is unfailingly affable.
Mr. Letterman has a more cantankerous personality on the air. His show has been described as not so much a talk show as a parody of one, and the host frequently mocks his staff, his employers, his guests, and himself.
Many at NBC feared that Mr. Letterman's less conventional style of humor might not be as comfortable for the wider audience at 11:30. But the entertainment executive said that Mr. Letterman had discussed altering his show to make it more suitable for that audience. CBS executives said this week that they would welcome the Letterman show exactly as it was.
Even if Mr. Letterman changes nothing about his show, there are risks in the move he is about to make. NBC has been broadcasting late-night entertainment practically since the beginning of commercial television. CBS, which has no such late-show history, may have trouble accustoming viewers to tuning in. And many of CBS's affiliates around the country do not carry the network's programming at that hour, preferring more profitable syndicated shows. CBS is expected to offer financial incentives to its affiliates to carry the Letterman show.
Mr. Letterman's departure from a show that earns a profit of about $20 million a year will create a serious economic problem for NBC, even though the network has saved itself the expense of matching the CBS offer, or of settling Mr. Leno's contract. As one NBC executive noted about the Leno-Letterman face-off: "It really means that we'll have to compete with one of our own shows on CBS."

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY;
Boxes Bulging With Decades of Clinton's Life Await Journey Into History

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Jan. 13

 BODY:
It was a strange moment: The world was churning and bombs were dropping and President Bush was still facing down Saddam Hussein, making decisions in Washington that would dramatically shape the beginning of the new Democratic Administration. And Bill Clinton was sitting in the small-town quiet of Little Rock, with his life as Governor packed up all around him.
Moving boxes marked for the White House had handwritten notations: "Scrapbooks," "Xmas decorations," "HRC -- Personal Files, No. 1," "Book Stand Table From Family Room," "Family Room Upstairs, Watercolor of Ballerina 'Chelsea,' " "Photo of BC and Chelsea," "Ornate Silver Frame, Color Photo of Chelsea," and "Picture of Boys Nation." 
 Mr. Clinton's Ping golf clubs in a white leather bag stood ready to go, and there was even a brown carrying case with a silver label for the Clinton cat, engraved "Socks, C/O Chelsea Clinton, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington D.C., 20500."
Books were stacked, waiting to be packed, including "Super Reading Secrets," "Search for Serenity" and "The Cat Who Wasn't There," and a box of gift mugs from Buffalo, Australia and places in between were ready to go. The Clintons did not seem to be taking along a painting of two morose-looking hunters with rifles who had strung up half a dozen deer by their necks.
Mr. Clinton did not seem nervous about the global headaches he is about to inherit, as he sat for an hourlong interview this afternoon about the job he starts in a week.
It was an odd reversal. The man who ordinarily acts famously self-assured about domestic policy was on the defensive about where he is headed with the economy and about the ethical tone of his Administration. The man who has had little foreign policy experience seemed confident and calm about the sort of moral consistency he wants in his foreign policy.
While he was paying close attention to the air strikes in Iraq, talking briefly to Mr. Bush on the telephone in mid-morning to offer his support, he seemed as much in the grip of the past as the future.
 
'Pretty Tough Slog"
 Conceding that staffing his Administration had been "a pretty tough slog," he added that it had been especially hard to "uproot a life of almost two decades here.
"The personal part is as big a distraction to me as anything else," he said. "You know, every morning when I go out I wonder if I'm seeing people I'm going to see for the last time."
Getting his Iron John misty look as he sat in a formal living room with a wilting poinsettia on the piano, his wooden rocking chair, a portrait of the first Governor of Arkansas, Gen. James Miller, and a "Thank You for Not Smoking" sign, Mr. Clinton later picked up the theme again.
"This is my life here," he said. "You know, this morning two of my friends came over and went running with me. I just have a real life here. I mean, this has been my life here. Almost 20 years. And then I was away for nine years and before that I lived my whole life here. And I've really got a good life. So does my daughter. So does my wife.
"I'll miss my whole network of friends and what I can do. I'll miss going down to the Y in the morning, my blue-collar gym, where there's nobody in bright Spandex outfits. I have a lot of friends in Washington. I think I'll enjoy it a lot. But it's been a very emotional two weeks for us, I must tell you."
When a reporter observed that Mr. Clinton sounded more melancholy than excited, he agreed: "Well, I think, when you move out of one stage in your life and you go into another, I think you feel that way."
Mr. Clinton was asked if those who knew him had started treating him differently.
"Not yet," he said. "But they're acting like they wonder if they're supposed to."
Asked if his friends had trouble knowing what to call him now, he nodded. "Yeah," he said. "They say Bill, Governor. Some people say Mr. President-elect. I try to get them not to say that. That's a cumbersome term."
But he turned a bit starchy when he was asked if his populism would extend to having his staff call him "Bill" rather than "Mr. President."
"No," he said. "I don't think that's appropriate. I think that at least during working hours, we should follow the protocol. All of us should."
 
'His-Her Offices'?
 Mr. Clinton said that while his wife's new role had not yet been formalized he opposed the suggestions that she get a job.
"No," he said, sounding stubborn as a child. "I don't want her to have a job outside the White House. I want her to help me. Besides that, I want to support her. She's been supporting me for 15 years. This going to be the first time -- we've been married since 1975 and the only year where I made more money than she did is the first year we were married. So, I got a lot of catching up to do. I haven't supported her very well all these years, so I want her to work there."
Asked whether his wife would break precedent and take an office in the West Wing, near the Oval Office and the power meetings, he hinted that, if it were up to him, he might knock down a wall and have adjoining his-and-hers offices.
"I don't know that anybody's office has been fixed except mine," he said. "That's true. We're keeping looking at that. I wish -- the office structure in the White House is not the best. We're trying to figure out what to do about that. They won't let us knock down any walls. So we got to figure out what to do."
But when he was asked if Hillary Clinton had been in on any of the national security meetings about the crisis in Iraq, he replied quickly, "No."
He said that he was still working on his inaugural speech and that there would not be any big surprises. "Well," he said with a grin, "I'm not going to resign on the second day or anything. No, really, I'm having a real good time at it. The part of it that has been fun for me so far is just seeing what others do. I read Jefferson. You know, when you get back there -- it's all pretty instructive. From Lincoln forward, there really was modern language."
Mr. Clinton continued: "Wilson's first inaugural was one of the great speeches. And Roosevelt's first speech was great. And Kennedy's. But in some ways the most effective of them, even though it was the closing of a chapter rather than the opening of one, was the second speech of Lincoln's, which I believe was the shortest."
Asked if his own speech would be short or long, the politician who does not believe brevity is the soul of oratory just laughed.

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY;
Excerpts From an Interview With Clinton After the Air Strikes

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Jan. 13

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview with President-elect Bill Clinton at the Governor's Mansion here by reporters from The New York Times.
Q -- Clearly Saddam Hussein has not got the message on complying with U.N. sanctions. What people would like to know is: What are you prepared to do -- what are you ready to consider doing beyond what has already been done -- to get this man to comply with U.N. sanctions? 
 A -- Well first, let's begin with today's events. I support the action that the United States took today. The President and his team in the White House consulted with us all along the way. The relationship we've had has been appropriate under the circumstances. That is, they have to make the tactical decisions. They have access to facts and information and resources that we don't.
I think that it was the right thing to do. I think a couple of times over the last year and a half we have sent mixed signals. I think that the hope is we will send a firm and consistent set of signals. So let me just say I wouldn't rule out reviewing our options in the future. But I want to see what he does in response to this mission today, and we'll see what happens over the next several days and we'll take it from there.
Q -- We have now introduced a battalion of ground troops in Kuwait. Would you rule out reintroducing ground troops into this theater?
A -- I wouldn't rule out any options. I think the actions in sending the battalion there, given the attacks of the last couple of days, was an appropriate action. And I hope that we can resolve the bitter disputes there. The Kuwaitis have made some overtures in areas they feel they are ready to discuss with Iraq about their investments in that area.
Q -- Clearly, the relationship between Bush and Saddam became a very personal one. Do you think there is the possibility for a fresh start between you and Saddam? If he were here on the couch, what would you say to him?
A -- If you want a different relationship with me, you could begin by upholding the U.N. requirements to change your behavior.
You know, I'm not obsessed with the man, but I am obsessed with the standards of conduct embodied in those U.N. accords, and I think that if he were sitting here on the couch I would further the change in his behavior. You know, if he spent just a half, maybe even a third of the time worrying about the welfare of his people that he spends worrying about where he positions his SAM missiles and whether he can aggravate Bush by violating the cease-fire agreement, what he's going to do to the people who don't agree with him in the south and in Iraq and in his own country, I think he'd be a stronger leader and be in a lot better shape over the long run.
Q -- Do you sense that he is also interested in pushing personal buttons, that he has done that with George Bush and wants to do that with you as well?
A -- I honestly don't know how to answer that. I've thought about it, obviously, a lot. And I thought to myself this last week: why is this man doing this? And I've asked others who've had more experience with him than I do. I'm genuinely interested. But I honestly don't know.
Q -- But you don't take the view that there can be no normal relations with this man or with Iraq as long as he is in power?
A -- Based on the evidence that we have, the people of Iraq would be better off if they had a different leader. But my job is not to pick their rulers for them. I always tell everybody, "I'm a Baptist; I believe in deathbed conversions." If he wants a different relationship with the United States and with the United Nations, all he has to do is change his behavior.
Q -- What is it that you can do, what can the United States Government do, to offer Saddam Hussein anything that moves us beyond the game we're playing now?
A -- I don't know the answer to that. It's obviously something that we'll have extended discussions on. But the main thing is we can't do anything to give him or anyone else the slightest indication that we are wavering. You know, look at what he did with this whole issue back a few months ago on who could be in the inspection teams in the government buildings. It's one of these deals where the Bush Administration, in an attempt to be somewhat reasonable, gave him some cushion about who gets to look in the buildings, and none of this seemed to have any effect.
If I knew what was motivating him -- is he sticking it to Bush at the end? Is he trying to test me? I just don't know. If I knew what was motivating him, I could come a lot nearer to answering your question. But since I don't know that, all I can do is deal with what I can see, and that is his conduct. I wouldn't rule out anything, except to say that I have no intention of seeing our nation back away from the adherence to the guidelines.
 
On Cooperation With Bush
 Q -- Walk us through what must be an extraordinary situation. You are a week away from coming into office. And you have found yourself not only with a hot spot, but many? What considerations went through your mind in deciding to support the Bush Administration policy?
A -- This one was easier than some. This was a harder-than-usual transition in the sense that we're involved in Bosnia (both the no-fly zone and the negotiations are showing some movement), hanging fire in Somalia (and what exactly is the parameter of our behavior there?), and our mission in Haiti, where our transition wants to do a little more there, with the cooperation of the Administration.
It's kind of an interesting thing. As far as I know, this level of interface and this level of activity is fairly unprecedented, especially when you change parties. I wish I could give you some high-flown issue. This was an easy deal for me. All during the campaign I took the position that we had to hold them to the guidelines, that in times past right after the war, the allies eased up, and he abused the Kurds.
When it was clear to me that he was doing things that he should not be doing with the placement of the SAMs and the incursion into Kuwait, it was clear the Administration was going to have a response and that the allies would support it. It was just easy to say, "You do it, and I'll support you." I didn't even give any thought to it. It was just the thing to do.
Q -- You talked about the unusual transition and the world practically blowing up around us. How do you keep yourself from becoming overwhelmed by world problems when you promised to focus on the economy and go all out from the first day in office on domestic issues?
A -- The answer is to set aside a disciplined amount of time to it, to be on the offense, international, you know. I did say that, but also if you go back, I gave a major foreign policy speech in 1991 at Georgetown, and then at several times during the course of the primary and the general elections talked about foreign policy and said basically that foreign and domestic policies were two sides of the same coin and that we had to be initiators in the world and that, you know, we're so caught up in the world that if I tried to sort of hunker down and pretend all this wasn't going on, eventually -- and I mean very near term -- I would simply be consumed by problems I was not taking the initiative on.
The answer that I would give the American people is: I still think our first priority is to rebuild America at home, economically and otherwise. I still intend to do those things which I laid out in the campaign to try to increase our investment focus, to try to make us more competitive, to try to generate jobs and raise incomes. But a part of my job, especially now at this moment in our history, is not only to tend to these fires that have been burning but also to develop an approach to the world which will permit us to have a post-cold-war world that is a good place for freedom and democracy and market economics and which supports global growth and minimizes global misery. I just think that's a part of the job.
So the answer to your question is the discipline with which I do it. The debates -- and I don't want to revisit the election, but I remember once someone asked me when President Bush and I were debating all this, someone gave me a chance to take a shot at him because of the number of days he had been out of the country. And I said -- I remember it very clearly -- I said I had no problem with the time he spent traveling abroad. My differences with him had to do with what he does with the time he is in the United States.
Q -- Are you going to find that just by shear number of hours, you won't have the time to spend on domestic problems?
A -- No. I disagree with you. If I organize it right, we'll do fine. We'll have to work hard, but we'll do fine. There are a lot of problems -- I mean, I ticked them off earlier -- you've got to deal with from Day One.
Q -- You said the easy deal for you was the decision today to take some action against Saddam. What of the other issues you've named? I guess Somalia and Bosnia come to mind. For instance, in Somalia, when you take office you've got to decide how long you're going to commit troops.
A -- In Somalia, that also was easy in terms of supporting the policy. I felt very strongly for a long time that the United States should do more to try to end the suffering there. And I thought it was a doable thing. I thought it was militarily manageable. And while tragically we've lost our first soldier there yesterday, the mission seems to me still to be appropriate. The real difficulty in Somalia was -- we were talking about it -- was I never believed that the Administration's optimistic hope that they could bring our combat force out by January the 20th could be achieved.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q -- How long can you imagine staying there?
A -- Well, I don't know. I think they'll be there several more weeks though, and I think what we have to work out is a peace-keeping force that's multinational, that's smaller, and where we're in a support role, maybe even offshore. I still think that the general outline of the mission can be accomplished. I have no reason to believe it can't. But it was somewhat more complicated than this response. I had to imagine what it would be like taking it over in midstream.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q -- Would you take us through, from Monday to today, the conversations that you had with the Bush Administration? Exactly what kind of contacts went on between you and the White House? How did it evolve?
A -- Well, I think all that I should say about that is that Brent Scowcroft has been very good throughout this entire transition to be in touch with Tony Lake and Sandy Berger in Washington. And Nancy Soderberg is here with me, and we just had daily conversations. And then this morning, when everything was approved for the mission to go forward, and the weather and everything cleared, the President called me and we talked about it.
Q -- What time was that?
A -- Sometime in the morning, sometime in mid-morning, and we talked. But he knew that he was formalizing an understanding that had already been developed at the staff level.
Q -- Was there a point when he said, "Governor, I'm going to do this. Do you approve of it?"
A -- No. He called me and thanked me for my support because he knew we had already given him our position and told him that we weren't sure he had any choice under the circumstances. And just, if that's what he wanted to do, then we'd support him.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q -- Saddam has shown that rationally or not, he doesn't seem to be afraid of the United States. If he's not afraid of George Bush, why should he be afraid of you?
A --: I don't know if fear is the issue. But all I know is he misread this country pretty badly in the days before the Gulf War. There was really an effort to try to work with him with a cease-fire agreement. Some of this Administration's critics thought we were cutting him a little slack.
I just can't say what he would do. All I can say is I expect as President I'll be tested in a lot of ways by a lot of people, at home and abroad. And part of my job is to meet the test. All I can tell you is, sitting here, is that would be a foolish thing to do. Because you know that's going to happen. I am not going to abandon the oath of office, and I'm not going to abandon my position and my convictions.

 	 	 		. . .	 	This is a United Nations effort in which there is strong solidarity. The Russians made a statement about this just recently.
We can't afford to let this endeavor disintegrate and dissipate because the United States has a lack of resolve.
Q -- Would you be willing to enter into a shooting war?
A --: I have to say I wouldn't rule anything in or out.
Q -- Could you imagine ever having normalized relations with Iraq as long as Saddam is in power?
A --: I can't imagine having normalized relations with Iraq with the sort of behavior that characterizes what they did.
 
On War-Crimes Trials
 Q -- Are you ready to support a Nuremburg-like war-crimes trial?
A --: I think what has gone on there certainly constitutes a war crime under international law. Now, who is a war criminal is a question of fact: Who knew what? What did the army do? What did the irregulars do? What did Milosevic support or not support from Serbia? But i don't think it's something we can let go; I think it's something that ought to be looked into. . . . There needs to be an investigation into violations of international law on this. The reason this Bosnian thing is so tough for me is that I understand the problems in Europe: slow economic growth; Germans have taken on a quarter of a million refugees . . . the military situation in Yugoslavia. But somehow the West has got to say something and do something about the idea of "ethnic cleansing," which is such an embracing idea that if you believe in it, it justifies the brutalization of women who aren't your women and the torture of children that aren't your children.
I think it is important to point out that this Bosnian thing has potential ramifications further away from the reach of the United States and Europe on the republics of the former Soviet Union, in central Europe. . . . There are some other things we can do if this process breaks down. There may be some things we can do militarily, short of the introduction of a large ground force, that would change the dynamics at play there. I don't want to rule any of those things out.
I want to say that even though I know a lot of it is maneuvering, I am still hopeful of what these parties have said about the Vance-Owen peace mission because there is a chance that if we do it right and they perceive their interests rightly that it can take on a life of its own and we can bring it to a successful conclusion.
Q -- When you say we've got to send a signal on "ethnic cleansing," something like considering war-crime trials is what you're talking about?
A -- Well there may be other things we can do. I don't want to foreclose my options by discussing them before I make a decision. I think that as horrible as the loss of life and the torture and the butchery and the starvation has been the potential for a bigger impact than that even, because it's all been done under the notion of "ethnic cleansing." I mean, here we are on the verge of the 21st century, and people who are literate, who can read and write, who are part of a very old, civilized tradition, think it's O.K. to slaughter the living daylights out of one another under the guise of "ethnic cleansing." It is a barbaric idea.
I mean, I know we've got a lot of problems in this country -- I know we do -- that I've got to address. I know the tensions, for example, in Los Angeles are still not what I wish they were -- they're not as good as I wish they were. But Lord of Mercy, there's 150 different racial and ethnic groups in Los Angeles County. I mean, we are at least making an effort to go forward. . . . I know that ethnic divisions are one of the strongest impulses in all of society, all over the world. But we've got to take a stand against it. It's an awful idea, and the potential ramifications are very very great, because they justify doing anything.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q -- There have been a lot of questions raised -- Ron Brown and the party that has just been canceled; Zoe Baird and whether she supports tort-reform that you didn't; Warren Christopher and whether he lied to Congress -- that have all contributed to a questioning not only of your selections but in general of your credibility in saying that you would change business-as-usual in Washington. Is that not fair?
A --: Well, it's not accurate. For one thing, when you appoint people, all questions should be raised about them. That's all part of it. I don't mind questions being raised about them. But keep in mind I did what I said I would do. We had the first code of ethics for people in transition. We had the toughest code of ethics for Cabinet members that they've all had to sign off on. I think that party should have been canceled.
Q -- Did they talk to you about it?
A --: No. I mean they did this morning when I knew about it. But my staff knew about it. We all thought it was the right thing to cancel the party. There's a big difference between being chairman of a political party where people may be supporting your political party or the other one, and having a Commerce job where you actually make decisions here. So i think it was exactly the right thing to cancel the party.
Q -- You don't question his judgment in agreeing to the party in the first place?
A --: Well, it wasn't part of my deal then. I mean, he was party chairman. They were going to have a party. He thought he was going out as party chairman. Whether it was or was not the right thing to do, it had nowhere near the magnitude of the Commerce Secretary-designate. That made it a very different issue.
On the other issue, I do want to say -- the other issue your paper editorialized about, which is what his standard ought to be for making decisions in cases involving his former clients -- as you probably know, each of these departments has an office of government ethics, and all we told our people to do was talk to the office of government ethics within each department and make sure they knew what the rules were, and then adhere to those rules, which is what he did. And that's what the office of government ethics told him to do. I think some good points were raised by the Times, and we are revisiting that. . . . He's revisiting too. It means he might come back to me and say the same thing. . . .
On this Zoe thing, I just think that's wrong. She represented her clients, taking the position that they took. It may be different from the position I took. I didn't agree with Dan Quayle on tort reform, but neither did I agree with the idea that no changes ever needed to be made. There were a lot of people I appointed to the Cabinet, and who I will appoint to other things, who may not agree with me on every single issue. I appointed her because I got to know her during the campaign, she did some very good work for us. I thought she was an extraordinarily able person, was one of the few lawyers I knew who had a reputation of being an excellent lawyer and who had real management experience, which I thought was sorely needed in the Justice Department. And everybody that I called about her who I knew well raved about her. I picked her because I liked her. . . . There is no ethical issue there at all. . . .
Wait a minute, wait a minute. This is an amazing thing to me. If someone comes to work for me and they once held a position when they worked for someone else, different from my position, why wouldn't you assume that my position would prevail? I mean, I've always been amazed by the notion that the President assumes the positions of the people he appoints.
 
On Keeping Campaign Promises

Q -- Tort reform aside, there is a series of issues where it looks like every day, you're backing more away -- gays in the military, the middle-class tax cut.
A -- I have not backed away from gays in the military. I have not backed away from -- I put out a book which said how much I thought I could cut the deficit. You're trying to move the target on me. You're trying to say that I have no right to pursue an investment budget, no right to grow the economy. The deficit is a lot bigger than it was when I put out my book, "Putting People First.'

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q -- What about a middle-class tax cut?
A -- I think that is the one thing I have to think about exactly how to do in light of the bigger deficit. But you can say again, "Well, he is backing away from a commitment," but the deficit is now 50 to 60 billion dollars bigger five years from now than we thought it was going to be. The American people expect me to deal with the circumstances as I find them, and if they are changing and hemorrhaging I have to deal with that.
Let me just say this: judge me by my performance. I said I would give the most diverse Cabinet in history, and we have one -- we have an excellent Cabinet. I think they're sailing through on confirmation, by and large, doing very well. I said I would impose ethics standards on my Cabinet secretaries, higher than anybody else, and I'm going to do that. I said I would present a bill to the Congress. I'd have a growth package. I'd have a deficit-reduction package that was rigorous and real. I would have ethics legislation and political reform. I'd do national service. And watch, I'm going to try to do those things. I've got to get the Congress to go along, but I think we can.
So I think that given the enormity of the challenges facing us and the fact that we have a challenge, interestingly enough, to do something that I don't think any previous President has faced -- that is, we've got to try to deal with the deficit and investment at the same time -- I think we're going to do quite well, and I feel good about it.
Q -- What about the criticism that you got too caught up in diversity in selecting a Cabinet and that you were micromanaging the selection of White House staff.
A -- I did micromanage the cabinet appointments. I spent more time on the Cabinet appointments than anybody in history had, and I plead guilty to that. I personally interviewed them all. But they're in my Cabinet, and I spent a lot of time talking about what we wanted the mission of the department to be. I plead guilty to that, because I want people who'd be more or less in synch with me so that I could define the mission, not that they could never take a position different from mine but so that once I put them there, they could move forward. But I think you'll see that in the next several days there will be a huge number of decisions made on the staff and the subcabinet, and that I'm not trying to micromanage that.
I do think that on diversity what I tried to do -- the reason it took longer, is that I wanted to get diversity and excellence and compatablity, and I think I achieved that. I think it will be very hard for people to argue after these folks have a chance to perform, that there have been many Cabinets in the past that have been more full of ideas or excellence. I think this is an energetic, diverse idea-oriented cabinet. I think they'll do very well.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q -- We have to ask about Mrs. Clinton --
A -- Ask about her.
Q -- What's she going to do? Is she going to have an office in the West Wing? A job outside the White House?
A -- No. I don't want her to have a job outside the White House. I want her to help me. You know, besides that, I want to support her. She's been supporting me for 15 years. This is going to be the first time -- we've been married since 1975, and the only year where I made more money than she did is the first year we were married. So I've got a lot of catching up to do. I haven't supported her very well all these years, so I want her to work there. I don't know that anybody's office has been fixed except mine. That's true. We're keeping looking at that. I wish -- the office structure in the White House is not the best. We're trying to figure out what to do about that. They won't let us knock down any walls, so we've got to figure out what to do.

HEADLINE: Higher Jobless Rates Likely in New Survey

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
For the first time in 25 years, the Labor Department is revamping its monthly employment survey, and initial tests of the new questionnaire indicate that the United States has hundreds of thousands of people now listed as full-time workers who in fact hold only part-time jobs.
The tests also suggest that once the new survey replaces the present one, starting in January 1994, the unemployment rate may rise slightly. That is partly because unemployment is probably greater than the current survey can capture, and the new, more accurate one is likely to capture at least some of the additional unemployment, Government officials said. 
 "The results of our testing are very, very preliminary, and I would be more comfortable not saying it, but it looks like unemployment could be higher when the new survey is used," said Anne E. Polivka, an economist at the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, who is helping to develop the new survey.
 
Impact on Policy
 Apart from the unemployment issue, the new survey will produce information not now available that could have an impact on Government policies. It might, for example, encourage the Federal Reserve to raise or lower interest rates sooner than it might otherwise act as a result of the labor force data now gathered each month in the Current Population Survey, run by the Census Bureau in collaboration with the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The Labor Department will distinguish each month between people holding full-time jobs and those who now seem to be full-timers because they put together two or three part-time jobs, or some overtime hours, to work a full 35-hour week or more. Some 95 million people were listed as full-timers late last year because they worked the requisite 35 hours in the week before a monthly survey.
But the initial testing of the new format, with its more detailed questions, indicated that 2 percent of these "full-timers" -- 1.8 million people -- held dual part-time jobs. An additional 5.3 million people held a full-time job and also moonlighted in a second job, another distinction not currently captured in the monthly surveys. Part-time jobs generally do not pay as well or offer as comprehensive benefit packages as full-time jobs, so that a labor force composed of a rising number of part-time workers is probably less well off than one composed of more full-time workers.
With the new information, if the Federal Reserve sees that people are losing their second jobs or their pay from moonlighting over a period of several months, it might decide that the economy is weakening and lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth. The nation's forecasters would also incorporate such data into their latest predictions.
"The degree to which people are able to get multiple jobs to make up for a shortage of hours in their primary employment is an indication of the strength and flexibility of our economy," said Glen Cain, a University of Wisconsin labor economist who participated last week in a discussion of the new survey at a meeting of the American Economic Association.
Or a rise in dual job-holding may be an early signal that the economy is getting stronger, and higher interest rates may be in order to slow growth. This could happen even while the total number of people holding jobs, now about 118 million, and the unemployment rate, now 7.3 percent, remain unchanged.
In the current survey, anyone holding any job for any number of hours in the week before the survey is listed as employed. Now people will also be asked whether they regularly work full time or part time or hold two jobs, questions currently posed only in surveys conducted every year or two. The last was in 1991.
This is the fourth major revision of the monthly Current Population Survey since it was begun in 1940 to estimate the unemployment rate and to collect other work-force data. Some 65,000 households, a cross section of the national population, are interviewed each month, and this number will remain unchanged in the new survey. But for the first time since 1967, the questions are being revised and labor economists familiar with the changes generally welcome them.
In the 1960's, men still dominated employment and full-time jobs were the norm. The new questions are intended to capture more accurately such changes as the huge rise in part-time work and multiple job holders, the rise in the number of people now counted as employed who in fact work without wages in small family businesses, and the rise in the number of mothers who work part time rather than full time because they lack child-care assistance.
Preliminary tests of the new survey suggest that roughly 900,000 additional people now recorded as wage earners should in fact be listed as working in family businesses without pay. And nearly two million women consider themselves forced to work part time because they lack child-care help. That is a breakdown not captured in current data.
Planning for the revised Current Population Survey began in the late 1980's and the new questions were tested in 1990 and 1991 in focus groups and in random telephone polling. Since last July, the survey has been tested monthly among 15,000 representative households. The Census Bureau, which conducts the monthly survey and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which interprets the data, are just beginning to release information about the revisions and the test results, and more is to be disclosed starting next month.
Some questions might tend to lower the unemployment rate. In the new survey, reading classified want ads, by itself, no longer constitutes active job-hunting, a condition for being counted as unemployed.
But other changes in the survey could push up the unemployment rate, Ms. Polivka said. Rather than record their answers on paper, the interviewers in the new system are equipped with laptop computers.
When interviewers revisit the same households, they can call up on their computers the previous month's answers. That is likely to encourage people to be more consistent and precise in their new answers. Greater accuracy in turn tends to push up the unemployment rate, officials say.

HEADLINE: College to Replace Mall in Downtown Bridgeport

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Jan. 13

 BODY:
In another attempt to jump-start the economically depressed city of Bridgeport, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. announced today that a community college on the east side of the city would move to a new $23 million campus in the heart of downtown.
Under the plan, the Hi-Ho Mall will be demolished to make way for the Housatonic Community Technical College. The two-story mall, with its card shops, dime stores and family restaurants, has almost as many empty storefronts as active ones. 
 "A downtown campus for Housatonic Community College will best serve the needs of its students and, at the same time, strengthen the City of Brideport," the Governor said in a statement from his office in Hartford.
 
Office in City
 The announcement comes one month after Governor Weicker announced that he would open an office of his own in downtown Bridgeport, which flirted with bankruptcy in 1991 and continues to suffer from poverty, crime, drug problems and cutbacks in municipal services. The purpose of his new office, the Governor said, will be "to focus on the economic development and revitalization" of the city and its surrounding areas.
Mr. Weicker said that he plans to spend "a considerable amount of time" at the Bridgeport office, which is to open Feb. 1. Representatives of other state agencies will also work out of the office, at 10 Middle Street, a few blocks from the Hi-Ho Mall.
Under the plan for the college, still subject to the approval of the city's Board of Aldermen and the Bridgeport Financial Review Board, the state will buy the 12-acre mall property for $7 million from the owner, D'Addario Industries. The campus would occupy three acres of the site.
Mayor Joseph Ganim of Bridgeport joined the Governor in making yesterday's announcement about the college. "This decision," the Mayor said, "represents a 'new lease on life' for Bridgeport's downtown."
But many at the college were unhappy. "Students go to school to learn and grow not to help make a downtown grow," said Scotty Edminston, a 48-year-old student majoring in criminal justice. "The mall is a terrible site. It's not safe. This is just a political decision made by the Mayor and the Governor with no concern for who it affects whatsoever."
Mr. Edminston and many other students and faculty members favored moving the campus to another site under consideration, on Sylvan Avenue away from the downtown area.
Housatonic Community College has been in rented space since it was founded in Stratford in 1966. Since 1977 it has been in an old sewing machine factory on Barnum Avenue in one of the most dilapidated parts of Bridgeport.

HEADLINE: A Slot Machine Parlay;
Weicker and Indian Tribe Make a Big Bet

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. signed an agreement today permitting slot machines at the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe's casino in Ledyard, and the tribe in turn agreed to contribute at least $100 million a year in gambling profits to a fund to aid troubled cities and towns.
With the agreement, Mr. Weicker, who has been a forceful opponent of casino gambling, and the tribe, which would face competition from expanded gambling venues, appear to have outflanked the gaming industry, which has been pushing the state to approve casinos in Hartford and Bridgeport. 
 If slot machines are legalized at any sites off the reservation, the tribe would be released from its $100 million obligation to the state. Legal experts said the cash-transfer agreement was the largest of its kind.
 
Powerful Lobbying Force
 With the money earmarked for municipalities -- a sensitive and powerful lobbying force in Hartford -- gambling supporters would likely face an instant new opponent at Mr. Weicker's side if the fund were threatened.
"The casinos are dead," said Representative Ernest E. Newton 2d, a Democrat from Bridgeport who had been a supporter of a casino to help his city. "Very slick."
Others were not so quick to roll over.
The Mirage Resorts of Las Vegas, which has offered to build a casino in Hartford or Bridgeport, issued a statement saying the agreement may be challenged.
 
Political Paradox
 And some noted the paradox of Mr. Weicker, who has opposed increased gambling on moral and economic grounds, signing off on an enterprise that the 250-member tribe estimates will take $400 million a year from gamblers' wallets. Mr. Weicker said such a concession was needed to fend off what he viewed as the even greater evil: the building of casinos throughout the state.
Time may have been running out on the Governor. Earlier this month, a legislative task force recommended permitting slot machines at dog tracks, jai alai frontons and tele-tracks.
Some lawmakers said the agreement also robbed the Governor of his moral authority on the issue.
"There's been a flip here," said the Senate majority leader, William A. DiBella, a Democrat from Hartford who is also the Legislature's leading proponent of gambling as an economic development tool for cities. "He's come to the party and admitted that gaming revenues are acceptable."
Mr. Weicker denied that he had changed his position and said that because the tribe was a sovereign nation, the agreement with the Mashantucket Pequots does not represent an expansion of gambling in the state of Connecticut at all. In 1991, the tribe won the right to open a casino under Federal laws that govern Indian reservations. The casino opened last February.
Mr. Weicker also denied any overt attempt to block the Legislature from considering gambling legislation on its own.
"I can't think of a cleaner way to get additional revenues for the State of Connecticut," he said of the agreement. "It in no way takes away from the Legislature in pursuing whatever course it wants to pursue."
The agreement, signed by Mr. Weicker and the tribe's chairman, Richard A. Hayward, in a ceremony in Mr. Weicker's office, also opens the way for the tribe to begin an open war with Atlantic City for gambling dollars. Until now, the casino had only offered table games like poker, blackjack and roulette. The first 100 machines will be up and running this Friday, with at least 3,000 more machines by this summer, tribal officials said.
 
1,500 New Jobs
 The expansion will create 1,500 new jobs over the next nine months. A major advertising campaign aimed at Boston, New York City and northern New Jersey will begin this spring.
Gaming industry experts said that while slot machines would likely be a huge boon for the tribe -- in Atlantic City and Nevada, slot machines generally account for about 60 percent of a casino's gross revenue -- today's agreement would still leave Connecticut's casino as a distant and isolated competitor to Atlantic City.
"It's going to hurt, but it's not the big blow," said Paul M. Dworin, publisher and editor of Gaming and Wagering Business Magazine, a New York-based publication that tracks the industry.
But the Mashantucket Pequot tribe's growing economic clout within Connecticut cannot be denied. Late Tuesday, for example, the tribe began calling every bank in New England seeking to buy every Susan B. Anthony dollar in circulation. The first 100 machines will all run on Susan B. Anthony dollar coins, said G. Michael Brown, the casino's president and chief executive officer.
"We locked up $300,000 by this morning," he said.
Mr. Brown said the tribe also locked in an order for 700 more computer-controlled slot machines, also known as video slots, from the International Gaming Technology Company of Reno, which he described as the world's largest manufacturer of gambling devices. The first of those machines will come into use on Feb. 1, Mr. Brown said.
What the immediate application of the agreement means is that even if there is a legal challenge, money will already be rolling into the tribe's coffers and the fund for municipalities. The $100 million figure is based on the state receiving 25 percent of slot machine revenues. The tribe pledged $30 million in contributions over the next four months. Challenging the agreement could mean stopping that flow, and with the state budget facing an estimated $424 million shortfall in the year that begins on July 1, giving up what appears to be a sure thing may be a very tough sell for pro-gambling lawmakers.
 
Casino Schools
 Other provisions of the agreement could also be popular with some residents and legislators. The state, for example, had opposed having the tribe conduct a gambling school on nonreservation land to train casino workers. Today, Mr. Weicker said that opposition had been dropped, and the tribe, in turn had agreed to begin an active recruiting program in the state's largest cities.
A lawyer for the tribe, Barry A. Margolin, said tribal employment offices would be opened in Hartford, Bridgeport and New Haven to interview people seeking jobs in this year's expansion. The casino already employees 3,500 workers, making it one of the largest employers in New London County.
Mr. Margolin said that by voluntarily offering the money to the state, and insisting that the money be spent on local government aid, the tribe and the state have avoided running afoul of Federal Indian gaming regulators who have struck down some state-tribe agreements. In those failed agreements, he said, the state's actions were interpreted as trying to coerce money from tribes.
Other legal experts said cases like the Connecticut one, in which the self-interests of a tribe merge so completely with a Governor that tribal leaders would voluntarily open their wallets, had never been challenged because they had never occurred.
"It's more like coercing the Legislature," said Jim Abourezk, a former United States Senator from South Dakata who now represents Indian tribes in gaming issues.

HEADLINE: Brady Warns Clinton On Spending for Jobs

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
In blunt advice to President-elect Bill Clinton, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today that the economy was gathering steam and warned that it would be unwise for the new president to spur growth through a short-term program of increased Federal spending.
Though job gains are weak, "I don't think you ought to go at job creation by investment spending of the Federal Government," he said in an interview a week before he leaves office. "The Government doesn't create jobs. Two-thirds of the jobs are created by small business." He urged Mr. Clinton to rely on exports and small business for job creation. 
 Senator Lloyd Bentsen, who is the President-elect's choice for Treasury Secretary, told Congress on Tuesday that Mr. Clinton's advisers were weighing whether to increase deficit spending in the short term as a way to accelerate growth and create jobs.
 
 
Responding to Critics
 But Mr. Brady said today that growth was already fairly strong, averaging almost 3 percent last year. And he took pains to respond to all the critics who lambasted the Bush Administration's for doing little to spur the economy, which grew at an anemic rate of less than 1 percent a year during Mr. Bush's first three years in office. "All this kind of stuff that we had the worst record since the middle of the Depression is a lot of hooey," he said.
Mr. Brady said he was not sure what he would do after Jan. 20, beyond taking a vacation in February. He said he did not plan to work full time at his former investment bank, Dillon, Read & Company, although he said he would give it whatever help he could.
Mr. Brady praised the Bush Administration for facing up to what he described as several "torpedoes at the waterline" that threatened to wreck the financial system when Mr. Bush took office. He said the Administration had largely resolved the savings and loan crisis, which many economists say had roots in the high inflation under Jimmy Carter and grew worse when President Ronald Reagan deregulated the banking system. In addition, Mr. Brady took credit for defusing the third-world banking crisis, which threatened to drown several of the nation's largest commercial banks.
Many economists say that once the Bush Administration resolved these crises it largely ignored the economy, giving the impression that it was oblivious about the recession that began in the summer of 1990.
 Mr. Brady boasted that commercial banks and savings and loans enjoyed record profits last year and that the capital reserves of the commercial banks were the strongest they have been since the 1950's.
With relish, he walked over to his desk and picked up an editorial from The Financial Times of London. A man who rarely shows his pride, he read the editorial, which said the Bush Administration "economic management rates at least a beta-plus."
"A B-plus is O.K. to me in this game," he said.
Two years ago The Financial Times and other European newspapers lampooned Mr. Brady as an American cowboy for urging Germany and other European countries to focus more on sustaining growth and less on fighting inflation. He was concerned that Germany's central bank had pushed up interest rates so high to fight inflation that it would strangle growth throughout Europe -- a prediction that has turned out to be true.
"I fought these guys for two years, saying growth is not like a light switch that you decide some morning you want to turn on and it goes on," he said. "It's a flame you have to keep lit."
 The Treasury Secretary, who has had strained relations with the Federal Reserve, could not resist a parting shot at the central bank.
"Do I think the Fed has acted with great wisdom?" he asked. "I don't."
Time and again he has criticized the central bank for acting too little and too late to cut interest rates and for letting the money supply grow too slowly -- a development that helps push up interest rates and slow economic growth. At times, he noted, the size of the money supply fell instead of growing.
"Try to make a declining economy come back on a predictable schedule when the monetary authorities are dragging down M-2," the most closely watched gauge of the money supply, he said.
He said he sympathized with, but did not completely agree with, those economists who argue that the Federal Reserve exerts too much power over shaping the economy.

HEADLINE: Domestic Oil Demand Up in '92 and Import Rise Filled Gap

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Oil demand rose significantly in 1992 for the first time since 1988, the industry's main trade association said yesterday, attributing the rise to "the stirrings of a turnaround in the economy."
But domestic production continued its seven-year decline, hitting the lowest level since 1960. The gap between consumption and domestic production was filled by imports, which the trade association, the American Petroleum Institute, said rose by about 4 percent last year. 
 Edward W. Murphy, the institute's director of statistics, said domestic production declined 3.8 percent last year, to 7.132 million barrels a day, essentially because of "a very low level of drilling" and because "drilling is not allowed in places that people believe have large" reserves.
The energy bill passed by Congress last year gave some tax relief to drillers beginning on Jan. 1. But drillers also want access to restricted areas in Alaska and at sea on the continental shelf.
Last year's statistics show the share of the energy market filled by natural gas, which is clean and available on this continent, continuing to rise. Its use grew 2.7 percent, compared with overall growth in energy consumption of 1.1 percent.
Over all, deliveries of oil products rose 1.6 percent last year, according to the institute. Jet fuel use reached a new peak and demand was up for gasoline and for distillates.
Highway miles traveled rose 3.3 percent, the institute said, leading to a 1.4 percent increase in gasoline use, to 7.3 million barrels a day. The two percentages differ because average fuel economy is rising.
Gasoline prices averaged $1.13 a gallon for unleaded, less than early 1991, when the Persian Gulf war pushed up prices, but more than the figure later in the year. The institute said that the price of gasoline was up 18 cents a gallon over the last five years but that this was less than inflation and that 10 cents of the increase was taxes.
Demand for all oil products in 1992 averaged 16.985 million barrels a day, up from 16.716 million in 1991. Imports of crude oil and products were 7.847 million barrels a day, up 2.9 percent.
Last year's numbers were still below the peak of the late 1970's; the record consumption level, 18.847 million barrels a day, was reached in 1978. The peak year for import share of consumption, 47.7 percent, was 1977. In contrast, the fraction of domestic consumption represented by imports was 46.2 percent last year, up from 45.6 percent in 1991.

HEADLINE: Pier 1 Imports Sees a Role As an Exporter of Expertise

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
For 30 years, Pier 1 Imports Inc. has brought bits of the world into American homes -- brass from India, wicker sofas from Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines and an array of other tchotchkes from exotic locales.
Now, it plans to go into the export business -- exporting its merchandise and retailing expertise. 
 The company has already established a beachhead in Britain, taking a stake last summer in a fledgling store in London called the Pier. Since then, three more Pier stores have opened there. And tomorrow, during a lunch at "21" in Manhattan, Pier 1 will unwrap for analysts its plans for international expansion. The opportunities the company says it will seek include moving into other parts of Western Europe and beyond, either on its own or in partnerships with local retailers.
American merchants have been cautious in mining overseas markets, mindful of the difficulties of transferring retailing concepts from one culture to another. In fact, Pier 1 joins only a small band of American retailers that are testing the waters in Europe and Japan, including Toys "R" Us, L. L. Bean, Kmart, the Gap and Nicole Miller.
"There's a burgeoning improvement in standards of living around the world," said Clark A. Johnson, Pier 1's chairman and chief executive, adding, as he so frequently does, a statistic to support his contention: "In the 1990's, one billion middle- class people will be created in the world. And when people achieve middle class, they want to live like Americans."
Americans, meanwhile, are embellishing their homes after a long spate of making do with what they had. Citing another useful factoid, Mr. Johnson noted that Management Horizons, a market research company, predicted that sales of sofas, chairs, vases, pottery and other home-decorating items will grow an average of 5.3 percent annually between 1991 and 1996, compared with 2.7 percent
over the previous five years.
After two years of declining sales and paltry earnings, Pier 1 has enjoyed a solid run of sales increases over the last five quarters. Holiday sales were exceptionally strong, besting the previous year's weak holiday showing by 14.1 percent. And analysts and retail experts believe the company will continue to benefit from the recovering economy.
Few analysts are aware yet of Pier 1's expansion plans. But Walter K. Levy, chairman of Walter K. Levy & Robert E. Kerson Associates and a consultant who has done work for many retailers seeking to make their way in international markets, said such a strategy would probably work well for Pier 1.
"We developed a concept for a U.K. retailer that involved similar kinds of products that was quite promising," Mr. Levy said.
 
Approaching Saturation in U.S.
 In the United States, Pier 1 will bump up against a growth ceiling by the end of the decade, when it expects to have 900 stores here -- roughly 300 more than today. That ceiling is one reason why its stock price is devalued compared with younger home furnishings retailers like the Bombay Company, Williams-Sonoma and Lechters.
"It's a large company with a lot of stores in a lot of places halfway through its life cycle," said Peter Lynch, the superstar stock picker who used to manage Fidelity Investment's Magellan Fund and has long touted Pier 1 stock as undervalued. "A company like Bombay is in the first quarter of its life with 5 to 10 years of rapid growth ahead of it."
A group of 25 retail stocks is trading at a 6 percent premium to the group's growth rate, whereas Pier 1 trades slightly below that rate, according to Donald I. Trott, a retail analyst at Dean Witter.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Pier 1's shares closed at $12.50, down 12.5 cents.
 
Seeking a Balance
 The company's plan may also help Pier 1 balance the cyclical ebb and flow of the retail business. Its stores in the United States and Canada, for example, are starting to flourish as the economy revs up, while the Pier stores in London are waging a pitched battle with the weak economy there.
But the expansion may not completely appease Wall Street, which disapproved of Pier 1's purchase in 1990 of Sunbelt Nurseries, a chain of gardening and lawn-care stores in the Southwest and California. Pier 1 sold a 51.5 percent stake in the nursery business to the public last year and used the proceeds to retire its debt.
Mr. Johnson still hopes to reinvent Sunbelt in much the same way Pier 1 was reinvigorated starting in 1985, when he arrived with a team of new managers that set about closing old, tired stores, opening new stores under less expensive leases and transforming the company's image as a purveyor of beads and batik to a source for contemporary, affordable home fashions and furnishings.
Pier 1 has invested $10 million in refurbishing and building new stores for Sunbelt, which operates the Wolf Nurseries, Nurseryland and Tip Top chains. "We think going forward Sunbelt will make a solid contribution," Mr. Johnson said.
Pier 1's expansion abroad may be courageous, given retailers' failure rate in foreign markets. Galeries Lafayette, the French department store chain, has struggled to get its New York City store off the ground, although company officials note that a new advertising campaign and changed merchandising seem to have buoyed its business recently.
A few retailers have made a go of going global. Marks & Spencer, the giant British retailer, has had success in its stores on the Continent: its grand store in Paris is second only to its London flagship in sales.
Mr. Johnson said Pier 1 would use joint ventures and licensing agreements to open stores in the Far East, South and Central America and other countries where language and unfamiliar laws and business practices could present barriers to success. "We just think it's better to do business with a partner who's more familiar with the laws and speaks the language," he said.
In exchange, Pier 1 will supply its expertise in visual display, inventory selection and using computers to help manage the business.
The company also plans to open a office somewhere in Southeast Asia that will oversee production and sourcing of merchandise for its own stores and those operated by others.
"It's definitely exportable," Mr. Lynch said. "The things they sell are useful in Europe, in Asia, wherever."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Spend-Now, Tax-Later Orgy

BYLINE: By Sylvia Nasar

 BODY:
The disciples of John Maynard Keynes have long been urging President-elect Bill Clinton to adopt a policy of benign neglect toward the Federal deficit. The national debt, they say, was far bigger relative to the economy during the early years of the the postwar economic boom than it is today. So, this thinking goes, the mounting debt should not keep the new Administration from spending its way to a more robust economic recovery or bankrolling more public investment.
But a powerful new tool for analyzing how tax burdens are spread across different generations -- called generational accounting -- shows that this sanguine view is shortsighted at best. Learning to live with the deficit amounts to forwarding the bills for today's spending orgy to the nation's children and grandchildren. 
 If you're a baby boomer born, say, in 1950, your average lifetime tax rate is about a third higher than that of your parents, 31 percent versus 24 percent.
In dollars and cents, you can expect to pay $200,000 more in taxes than you collect in benefits over your lifetime.
The truly terrible news, according to new calculations by two economists: if current tax and spending policies continue, your grandchildren could end up paying 71 percent of their incomes to the government.
Most Americans understand that doubling taxes on future generations to pay for today's spending would be immoral, as well as infeasible. But traditional budget accounting -- estimating revenues and expenditures year by year -- says little about the long-term effects of fiscal policy and nothing at all about who ultimately picks up the tab.
"Any sustainable policy has to stabilize the future tax rate," said Laurence Kotlikoff, an economist at Boston University, one of the co-inventors of generational accounting and author of a recent book by that title. "The real constraint on fiscal policy is that you can't take more than 100 percent of future income."
He added, "Rising taxes rates on future generations -- not the debt per se -- show us that we're in a mess."
The notion of quantifying myopic fiscal policies is the brainchild of Professor Kotlikoff and Alan Auerbach at the University of Pennsylvania. Their ideas are just beginning to attract attention outside academia. This year, the Bush Administration's last budget report and the Economic Report of the President included a set of generational accounts.
Here's how they work: The economists add up all the taxes -- Federal, state and local -- paid over an individual's lifetime. They subtract all the cash benefits the person gets from the Government, including Social Security, Medicare and welfare. The difference is the lifetime tax rate.
The real message of these projections is that Washington's current path simply isn't sustainable.
"Obviously, taxes are going to go up and benefits will be under extreme pressure," Professor Kotlikoff said.
What's the solution? Cutting expenditures on current generations, especially the baby boomer's parents, or raising their taxes.
According to the White House budget report, "the generational imbalance between the newly born and future Americans could be largely eliminated by imposing a cap on mandatory spending (excluding Social Security) from 1993 to 2004 or by an appropriate tax surtax."
"Both policies significantly increase net taxes -- the taxes paid less transfers received -- by current Americans," the document continues. Specifically, tax rates on baby boomers and their children would rise to as much as 40 percent, but taxes on future generations would remain under 50 percent.
Some Clinton proposals -- to raise taxes on the rich, increase the gasoline levy or slow the growth of health-care spending -- amount to steps in the same direction.
"Getting control of health-care spending is essential to keeping tax rates far away from 100 percent," said Barry Anderson, assistant director of the Office of Management and Budget. "You could make a huge contribution by simply limiting benefit increases to the elderly to inflation."
On the other hand, a proposal long favored by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, could make things worse from a generational point of view. His idea to cut payroll taxes -- but not benefits -- would ease the burden on baby boomers but increase it enormously for their children.
Critics of generational accounting, like Henry Aaron at the Brookings Institution, say it's intriguing, but impractical. There's just too much uncertainty about future interest rates, demographic trends and a host of other assumptions needed to figure future tax bills that generational accounts shouldn't be used to screen policy proposals.
But fans of the novel method see it as a consciousness-raising device.
"I wouldn't advocate this stuff being written into a new rule," Professor Auerbach said, "but I'd be overjoyed if every time a signficiant budget proposal was introduced, it's long-run implications would have to be considered."
