HEADLINE: COLLEGES;
A Final U.N.L.V. Season Is Reported for Tarkanian

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev. June 6

 BODY:
Jerry Tarkanian, whose 18 years at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas have been marked by highly successful teams and continuing investigations by the collegiate authorities, will step down as basketball coach after next season, according to a person close to Tarkanian who has knowledge of his plans.
Officials at the university have scheduled a news conference for Friday morning to announce his plans. 
 Tarkanian had said in interviews this week that he was considering resigning immediately. But the person said that the coach's attorneys did not want him to be unemployed. By coaching through next season, they reasoned, he will have time to look for a new position, presumably at the professional level.Tarkanian has also said that he wanted to avoid the appearance of running out on his team.
 
Pro Job a Possibility
 The 60-year-old coach met this afternoon with Robert Maxson, the president of U.N.L.V., to discuss the decision and the way it will be announced. Although Tarkanian indicated today that he had made up his mind, he would not say definitively what he would do. "I'm all set," Tarkanian said this afternoon. "I was all set last night, really. We want to talk about how he wanted to announce it, whether it was a press release or whatever."
According to another official who is close to the basketball program, who also spoke on the condition that he not be named, Tarkanian has already been offered a front-office job with a professional basketball team. Tarkanian declined to comment on the offer, but both the Dallas Mavericks and the Los Angeles Clippers have been mentioned as possibilities.
Tarkanian said he would definitely not want another college job. "I'm too old for anything like that," he said.
 
Team Under Scrutiny
 Tarkanian and the U.N.L.V. basketball program have been under scrutiny by the National Collegiate Athletic Association for many of his years at the university. The basketball program is on probation for recruiting violations dating to the mid-1970's and is the subject of an N.C.A.A. investigation into the recruiting of Lloyd Daniels, a highly touted New Yorker, in 1987.
The final blow apparently came less than two weeks ago when The Las Vegas Review-Journal published photographs showing three members of Tarkanian's 1989-90 championship team relaxing in a hot tub and playing basketball at the Las Vegas home of a convicted sports-events fixer, Richard Perry.
Tarkanian had originally wavered between announcing a decision on Friday or waiting until Monday. But Maxson urged him to do it sooner.
 
'A Brutal 11 Days'
 "I think the concern against waiting over the weekend was the speculation," Tarkanian said. "Every day there are three columns written on it with everybody speculating this and speculating that.
"I'm very disturbed and disappointed by all of this," he said. "This has hurt me greatly. It's never let up. It's been a brutal 11 days."
Speculation about Tarkanian's future had been building since Monday when he met with the University of Nevada Board of Regents and outlined several options for leaving the university.
Tarkanian has three years remaining on a rollover contract that pays him $203,976 a year.

HEADLINE: TV WEEKEND;
Clarence Darrow, Standing to Face the World

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
"Darrow" is about Clarence Darrow, the legendary lawyer. (Darrow hated his first name, jokingly referring to it as a curse.) The two-hour film, an "American Playhouse" presentation at 9 tonight on Channel 13 and at 10 P.M. on Channel 49, stars Kevin Spacey in the title role, and that's its strongest asset. Mr. Spacey, winner of the Tony Award for best supporting actor on Sunday for his performance in Neil Simon's "Lost in Yonkers," latches onto Darrow and, covering some 30 years of his career, hangs on tenaciously.
Darrow is one of those American originals who believed, as the film puts it, that a person has to "be strong enough to stand alone and face the world unafraid." He was born in 1857 in rural Ohio and began practicing law in Chicago, his home base for more than 50 years. He started out as a lawyer defending railroad interests, but impressed with the labor crusading of Eugene V. Debs, he soon took up the causes of civil rights and workers. He was a Socialist and an agnostic who considered the Bible to be a work of literature falling somewhere between "Aesop's Fables" and "Bulfinch's Mythology." 
 This account, feistily directed by John Coles ("Signs of Life," "Rising Son"), tells something of the private man. His workaholic schedule prompts his first wife, Jessie (Erin Cressida Wilson), to leave him, taking their son with her. His second wife, Ruby (Rebecca Jenkins), becomes a kind of partner, traveling around the country with Darrow as he gives lectures and takes on new cases. Not all of them are triumphs.
In Los Angeles, defending two men accused of triggering a fatal explosion at The Los Angeles Times, Darrow runs up against the fury of the establishment and ends up discovering not only that his clients are indeed guilty, but also that he himself has been implicated in a scheme to bribe prospective jurors. Deserted by his friends and rapidly going broke, Darrow finds his spirit broken as he faces a bitter trial. He delivers his own closing argument, saying in part: "My crime is that I've spent my life fighting for the weak. The rich and powerful would still my voice."
All in all, a fascinating man, but unfortunately, this script by William Schmidt and Stephen Stept fails to do him full justice. The construction is awkward, with Darrow's son, Paul, (Stephen Mailer) sporadically called in to provide the narration. The dialogue is top heavy with cliches. The biographical elements are oddly selective, fastening on a few major cases and ending with the "crime of the century," involving Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold, privileged young men who had murdered a boy.
Darrow, who vehemently opposed capital punishment ("mercy is the highest attribute of man"), advises the young men to "plead guilty to all charges and rely on the judge to save your lives." The strategy works.
And there "Darrow" abruptly ends, cryptically noting that Darrow would take on the Scopes trial the next summer. Apparently, the producers either ran out of money or decided that there wasn't much point in competing with the entrenched version of the trial widely circulated in the play "Inherit the Wind." In any event, Mr. Spacey's powerful performance is left hanging in a generally solid but irritatingly incomplete production.
 
'The Secret Policeman's Biggest Ball'
Arts & Entertainment
Tonight at 8
This is an hourlong version of a London comedy ball staged to benefit Amnesty International. Some of the humor is very British and doesn't travel easily, but there's no mistaking the inspired zaniness of Dudley Moore and Peter Cook, together again after nearly 20 years, as they sail through a sketch about a one-legged actor auditioning for the role of Tarzan. John Cleese and Michael Palin offer a couple of "Monty Python" skits and the Spitting Image puppets tweak the Royal Family with wicked zest. Oh, those Brits.
 
'Garry Shandling:
Stand-Up'
HBO
Tomorrow at 11 P.M.
Unemployed as a sitcom star for the moment, Garry Shandling takes his genial-worrier routine back to the stand-up circuit, in this instance the University of California at Irvine. His stories range from shaggy dog (literally, about a pooch named Shep who gets to take a bow at the end of the show) to dinner at the White House ("I'm middle-of-the-road politically. I've never burned a flag, but I've never put one out, either.") Mr. Shandling remains a master of dubious defensiveness: "I'm very loyal in relationships. Even when I go out with my mom I don't look at other moms."
 
'I, Claudius'
Channel 13
Sunday at 9 P.M.
Just in time to cope with the summer doldrums, right through Aug. 25, a television classic returns to "Masterpiece Theater." Brilliantly adapated by Jack Pulman from the Robert Graves novels and directed by Herbert Wise, this 13-hour series -- with the first two episodes shown together this weekend -- gives us ancient Rome as it might have been run by a Mafia family. Topping the list of memorable performances are Derek Jacobi as Claudius, John Hurt as Caligula, Sian Phillips as Livia and Brian Blessed as Augustus Caesar. Absolutely outrageous, and irresistible.

HEADLINE: Keep Feeding Women, Infants, Children

 BODY:
It's well and good to talk, as President Bush does, about the year 2000 as the time by which all American children entering school will be truly ready to learn. But it's not going to happen if many of those children grow to school age without minimally decent nutrition.
That was the sensible message of five corporate executives when they testified before the House Budget Committee in March on the wisdom of a 19-year-old Federal program called WIC. WIC, for Women, Infants and Children, provides poor, pregnant or nursing women and their children with diet supplements and formula. 
 WIC works. Those five executives know it, Congress knows it and the Department of Agriculture may know it better than anybody. An Agriculture study issued last fall demonstrated that each dollar invested in WIC's prenatal work saves something like two dollars in Medicaid costs just in the first 60 days after birth. Furthermore, a recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests that WIC, by reducing the incidence of low-birthweight babies, produces long-term savings in special education costs.
WIC now serves about 55 percent of those eligible. As the first step in a five-year plan to enroll everyone poor enough to meet the criteria, the executives called for increasing financing next year, to $2.7 billion. So have 237 members of the House, in a letter to Jamie Whitten, chairman of the relevant House Agriculture subcommittee.
Today, that subcommittee has a chance to show just how sensible it is -- by voting that $2.7 billion for WIC.

HEADLINE: Dance Has Given Rise to Some of the Century's Greatest Music

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Bernard Holland's May 21 critic's notebook presents an enticing theory on the re-emergence of the public and the popular in the composition of classical music. It prompts me to expand on two different thoughts.
Some of this century's greatest music, including the post-World War II era Mr. Holland writes about, has come from commissions for dance companies. Dance in this era has had to meet its public head on and has stirred the creative fires in ways few art forms have matched in the last 40 years. Dance artists and institutions have been serious music's most consistent investors. 
 I find it sad to see in times of economic retrenchment that the artistic institutions that most support creativity are themselves most threatened. Dance has never had the resources of academia to support it and remains, even today, a virtually taboo subject in elementary and secondary education.
Globally, dance supports a wider range of creative artists than any other art form, and yet it is institutionally bankrupt. A recent survey indicates that virtually every American ballet company -- along with most modern dance companies -- is seriously in debt and retrenching.
Dance derives a higher percentage of its support directly from its audience. Mr. Holland applauds that, and so do I, but I fear America is too quick to remove the safety net and leave these artists adrift. I fear for the future of dance as a profession and the creative investment it generates.
A completely different response to the article concerns the abandonment of art as a core subject in a modern curriculum. When schools must cut, they need to cut math and English in the same proportion as they cut the arts and libraries. To do otherwise, allows education administrators to underprepare students.
I am not referring to the need to develop the next generation of great artists; I feel the real role that art education plays is to spur creative approaches to problem solving. To compete, each student needs to be creative; no topic explores unfettered creativity better than training in the arts. The arts speak to the very value of subjectivity, and they place a value on the ability to discern quality and to respond to it.
The United States does not have a single support base for art. And that has allowed the arts to flourish independently, but they have never truly been secure. Seeing education retrench from support of artists takes one more prop from a fragile balance of support. I fear America without its creativity.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Save Those Bases

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
The question is: How can the United States pull its strength and creativity together in a few months to win a military victory thousands of miles away but keep floundering around for years at home, throwing away one chance after another for social victory?
 The answer is: I don't know but let's not argue about it right now. While we stand around debating, one more opportunity to do the country some good is slipping through our fingers and our minds. 
 There's still time, but not much, for the nation to wake up, shake its head clear and seize a suddenly available asset in the war against drugs.
By July 1, a Presidential commission is supposed to report on how to close down and get rid of dozens of bases around the country that the military no longer needs.
For Heaven's sake, why close them all? Why not do as important anti-drug therapists are pleading, almost unheard? Why not take some of those bases and their already-built houses, school buildings, hospitals and workshops and turn them into what the drug war needs: large centers for the treatment of Americans desperately addicted but still rescuable?
A variety of studies show that for some sections of the population -- happily including high school students -- the allure of hard drugs is beginning to diminish. Anti-drug education in the schools is apparently having an impact. So is the work of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, which uses millions of dollars of advertising donated by newspapers and television to carry the message against drugs.
Good news, but. But the studies generally leave out the attitudes of Americans serving time in prison, of the homeless, the street children and other victims and victimizers who are part of a drug subculture digging deeper into society while the polls are taking place.
More crack babies are born to more unwed young women. Thebabies will pay forever. So will tax- payers; drug addiction is already a generation-to-generation heritage.
Drug gangsters still casually kill each other, which would be fine except that they take with them those who happen to walk by.
In Japan last month I walked nighttime streets without even thinking about danger. How's that for an economic advantage over America? Is it worth a million cars? Ten million?
Drug addiction helps spread and deepen some of our worst social epidemics: AIDS, homelessness, mental disorder, child abuse, criminal and domestic violence.
The only effective strategy is the one pushed by William Bennett before he suddenly quit as anti-drug administrator. That is to fight against drugs on all fronts at home and abroad -- intervention, law enforcement, education. Oh yes, and therapy.
That always seems to come at the end. But addiction is the one social disease whose victims never cease trying to spread the contagion. Without serious national effort at cure of addicts, neither disease nor subculture will ever die out.
The most effective therapy is the most demanding -- a year or more in therapeutic communities. The addict, who enters himself or is sent by courts, has to do difficult things. He has to face his own truths, struggle with his own weakness, accept the discipline of the community. The counselors, teachers, doctors and fellow addicts lend him strength and give him hope. But in the end he has to do the hardest thing of all -- realize that from now on there will be nobody to blame if he fails to keep drug-free, nobody but the face in the mirror.
Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal, head of Phoenix House, perhaps the best-known therapeutic community in the country, estimates that 70 percent of the addicts can liberate themselves -- provided they stay for a year.
 To build all the centers needed would cost billions and involve endless public hearings. But there they are, with all their buildings for housing and training, on the bases we are about to close and scrap.
Yes, then the Federal Government and the states would have to spend more to help the centers operate. It is expensive -- about $15,000 a year for a patient. And it would take a decade to handle the core drug population.
But put all together it is a deep discount on what jails and drug crime would cost the country -- decades without end, and not even counting the blood.

HEADLINE: Latin Population Puts Pressure on the U.S.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Hispanics' Promised Land's Broken Promises" by the Rev. Joseph A. Fahy (letter, May 25) focuses on "the burgeoning Spanish-speaking population nationwide." He cites 12 unhappy reasons to explain this. Father Fahy ignores a central cause of the phenomenon, of his 12 reasons and of the mass influx of Latino immigrants to the United States. 
 That cause is the too rapid population growth that continues to swamp the economies and imprison the aspirations of Latin Americans.
In 1950, the populations of North America and Latin America stood equally at 166 million. By 1990, North America's population was 278 million, while Latin America's had swelled to 447 million. By the year 2020, United Nations figures project 328 million for North America, but for Latin America 705 million.
If Latin America's unbridled population growth continues, demographic projections will become realities, dooming free trade zones and other economic measures to failure.
So long as the Bush Administration and Father Fahy's church reject this, we can look forward to the continuation and acceleration on both sides of the border of the catalogue of woes that is contained in Father Fahy's letter.

HEADLINE: Supply Faces Demand in the Ivy League

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Justice Department officials hail as a victory for students the agreement by eight Ivy League schools to stop sharing student financial aid information (front page, May 23). And you quote Attorney General Dick Thornburgh as having said at a news conference, "Students and their families are entitled to the full benefits of price competition when they choose a college." 
 These are both honorable sentiments, but they reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of how tuition levels are determined and how a college education is financed.
The assumption by Justice Department officials that price competition will work to the benefit of students is based on a simple-minded application of economic theory. We all know that in a free market with perfect competition among many profit-maximizing businesses, competition serves to keep prices down to the level at which the market clears.
The problem is that universities have never been profit maximizers. At the schools covered by the consent agreement that you report, tuition covers only a relatively small portion of the actual cost of educating a student. The rest of the cost comes from other sources, such as alumni donations. None of these funds are used to pay dividends to stockholders, because there are no dividends and no stockholders.
That these universities are not in the business of maximizing profits should be clear from the fact that tuitions are as low as they are. The demand for admission to Ivy League colleges is always several times higher than the supply.
If these schools really were the profit maximizers the Justice Department seems to think they are, why haven't they raised tuitions to the level at which the market clears? And why do they offer deep discounts, in the form of financial aid, on a product that is in such high demand?
The answer is that these schools really do believe that they are serving a worthwhile social goal by keeping tuitions as low as possible. Rationing financial aid by avoiding bidding wars for students, including the use of the information-sharing meeting, serves this goal. It insures that the best use possible is made of each school's limited financial aid dollars.
The real irony is that the agreement with the Justice Department will only speed up the increase in tuition. If some students are able to bid up the amount of financial aid they receive, and thus pay less to attend an Ivy League school, someone else will have to pay more.
At that point, either other students will receive less financial aid, or the nominal tuition level will have to increase.
The result either way will be to increase the net cost to qualified students who lack the bargaining chips that count most at Ivy League schools.

HEADLINE: Sylvia Porter, Financial Columnist, Is Dead at 77

BYLINE: By GLENN FOWLER

 BODY:
Sylvia F. Porter, the author and newspaper columnist who gained wide readership by making business and financial news easy for the general public to understand, died on Wednesday at her home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. She was 77 years old.
She died of complications from emphysema, her husband, James Fox, said. 
 Miss Porter, who wrote more than a score of books on investment, taxes and other economic subjects, also reached 40 million readers through her column on personal finance. It was syndicated by The Los Angeles Times and carried five days a week by 450 newspapers around the world.
From the mid-1930's, when her column began appearing regularly in The New York Post, Miss Porter specialized in reporting events of the financial and business worlds in terms that translated what she called their "bafflegab." Her arrival on the economic scene came at a propitious time: the public was slowly recovering from deep disillusionment with a Wall Street community that many blamed for plunging the country into the Great Depression.
In 1978 she moved her column from The Post to The Daily News, where it continued under the title "Your Money."
 
Molded by 1929 Market Crash
 Miss Porter was born into a Russian-Jewish family in Patchogue, L.I., on June 18, 1913. Her father was a physician, and her mother became a successful milliner. She grew up in Brooklyn and was a freshman at Hunter College who intended to major in English literature and history when the stock market crashed in 1929.
Her mother had invested $30,000 in the bull market of the late 1920's and lost it all. The daughter rethought her career goals and plunged into the study of economics. She earned a Phi Beta Kappa key at Hunter and graduated magna cum laude in 1932, the same year that she and Reed F. Porter, a bank employee, were married.
She went to work for a small investment counseling firm in Wall Street and gained firsthand knowledge of the stock and bond markets, currency fluctuations, business cycles and other financial basics. She also took graduate courses at the New York University School of Business Administration.
She began writing in specialized financial journals, using the byline S. F. Porter to conceal the fact that she was a woman in a field then dominated by men. In 1934 she wrote a weekly column in The American Banker on United States Government securities and soon started her own information service on Government bonds.
 
A Crusader Role Adopted
 In 1935 Miss Porter began an occasional column in The New York Post on financial news. In a matter of months she was a regular writer on Wall Street for the paper, and in 1936 she was appointed financial editor. She wrote a daily column that was published under the title "S. F. Porter Says."
Miss Porter became a crusader against what she perceived as economic injustice. She bluntly criticized Government officials for their fiscal policies, at one point asking in an article in The American Banker whether the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr., had been guily of "obstinacy, stupidity or sheer ill advice" in managing Government bonds.
Mr. Morgenthau, like many other figures in the economic world, was unaware that S. F. Porter was a woman. When he did find out, and when officials acknowledged that many of her barbs were justified, he sent her a bouquet of roses.
Other Washington figures were not so forgiving. When she attacked Senator Edwin Johnson of Colorado for his advocacy of silver, he called her "the biggest liar in the United States."
 
Author of Many Books
 In 1939 she wrote the first of her many successful books, "How to Make Money in Government Bonds." The book combined her inside knowledge with a popular style, making her information useful to professionals and at the same time accessible to the public.
In her second book, "If War Comes to the American Home," published in 1941 on the eve of America's entry into World War II, she drew on the experience of World War I to tell families how they might be affected in a war economy.
A reviewer in The New York Times summed up her approach this way: "Facts, figures, broad word-pictures and succinct arguments are all presented with conversational ease."
Although her books were published under her full name and she had been heard on radio, it was not until 1942 that The Post changed the title of her column to "Sylvia F. Porter." The newspaper's acknowledgement of her sex brought prominence on the lecture circuit and requests for articles from women's magazines and periodicals of general circulation.
Her column was syndicated, beginning in 1947, and she collaborated with the tax specialist J. K. Lasser on financial handbooks for taxpayers, as well as with other specialists on parallel projects in various economic fields.
 
Posthumous Book Planned
 In 1975 she published "Sylvia Porter's Money Book: How to Earn It, Spend It, Save It, Invest It, Borrow It and Use It to Better Your Life." It sold more than a million copies. Her most recent book, "Sylvia Porter's Your Finances in the 1990's," appeared last year, and her last book, "Planning Your Retirement," is to be published in September.
Not all Miss Porter's ventures were successful. In 1984 she started a magazine, Sylvia Porter's Personal Finance, which rapidly became the third largest periodical in its field, behind Time Inc.'s Money and the Kiplinger organization's Changing Times. But the stock-market plunge in 1987 dealt her publication a lethal blow, and in 1989 its list of 400,000 subscribers was bought by Kiplinger.
Miss Porter's second husband, G. Sumner Collins, died in 1977. Besides Mr. Fox, a public-relations counsel, she is survived by a daughter, Chris Del Cuore of Norway, Me.; a stepson, Sumner Collins of Medical Lake, Wash.; a brother, Dr. John L. Feldman, a physician of Palos Verdes, Calif., and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Curtis Brewer, 65; Worked for Rights Of Disabled People

BYLINE: By GLENN FOWLER

 BODY:
Curtis Brewer, a lawyer who was a quadriplegic for much of his life and who founded Untapped Resources, a nonprofit legal-services agency for the handicapped, died on Wednesday at Tisch Hospital in the New York University Medical Center. He was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.
Mr. Brewer was stricken with a viral infection of the spine in 1955, when he was 30 years old, and was left paralyzed from the neck down. He died of complications from stomach surgery necessitated by a progressive weakening of his lungs that stemmed from the initial paralysis, his family said. 
 From his wheelchair Mr. Brewer fought for the rights of handicapped people. In 1964, he started Untapped Resources, for which he served as executive director and general counsel, to study the effects of social and economic conditions on the disabled.
Discovering that many of the disabled were unaware of their rights or prevented by bureaucratic red tape and other barriers from receiving services and benefits to which they were entitled, he set out to help them through legal action.
 
Campaign for Easier Access
 He graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1974 with a grade-point average of 3.5 and was admitted to the New York State bar without an examination, which would have been difficult for him to take because of his disability.
He was an early campaigner for easier access for the handicapped. Unable to get his wheelchair into Carnegie Hall some years ago to attend a performance by his friend Itzhak Perlman, the violinist, who himself uses crutches, Mr. Brewer began a campaign to secure wheelchair access to public auditoriums. A lift was subsequently installed on the Seventh Avenue side of Carnegie Hall, and when it was remodeled in the mid-1980's, elevators were put in for the first time.
In 1980, Mr. Brewer was named Handicapped American of the Year by the President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped.
Mr. Brewer, a native of Cambridge, Mass., was a graduate of the New School and studied at New York University before attending law school.
He is survived by his wife, the former Bettie Foster, a New York University administrator; a son, Scott, of Washington, a law clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall of the United States Supreme Court; two daughters from a previous marriage, Zakia Al-Ghuiyy, director of a geriatric treatment center in Atlanta, and Geraldine Hailstolk, a family therapist in Maryland; two brothers, Garland, of Medford, Mass., and Raymond, of Boston; a sister, Jean, of Roxbury, Mass., and four granddaughters.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
Caution Is Urged On Retiring Early

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
Many employees are seeing the silver lining as companies pare payrolls. Severance pay or early-retirement packages will enable them to strike out on their own and realize dreams of being their own bosses.
But this silver lining is likely to tarnish, financial experts say. Diane V. Schaak, president of the Denver-based Institute of Certified Financial Planners, said a great many of the middle- and upper-level managers and executives she counsels in her practice in Bellevue, Wash., feel they are under great stress and want to retire by age 55. 
 Often they hope to become consultants or do something more fulfilling, perhaps turn a hobby into a business. But, she estimated, only 30 percent have realistic plans; the rest could not take big changes or income reductions.
Alan Nadel, managing partner for Arthur Andersen & Company's compensation and benefits practice, said: "Don't go out today without guarantees" of business and clients. "It's hard to tell the landlord, 'I'll keep you in mind for the future.' "
Yet people caught up in the entrepreneurial spirit are often unrealistic, he said, and push ahead with such vague assurances as "We'll have to get together; I'll be referring people to you." One enthusiastic senior executive took out a home equity loan to set up his own business. "He lost his house," Mr. Nadel said.
Tamara G. Telesko, a vice president of the Chase Manhattan Bank, advises private banking clients to do the opposite: Repay home-equity loans and lock in a diversified portfolio of investments that provide a good cash flow to provide a foundation before building a new career. Nonetheless, George E. L. Barbee, executive director of personal financial services for Price Waterhouse, said: "The happiest retirements are when people are actively engaged in something besides leisure time. It wears thin; you can play golf just so many days."
An alternative career is one choice, volunteer work another, said Mr. Barbee, who is based in Waltham, Mass. It depends on people's finances and their personalities. But the single most common mistake, he said, is that people look at their income level only for the year they retire, failing to project future costs accurately, he said.
"People are living into their 90's," he said. "We're going to be consumers for a long time." So it is essential to make long-term projections in evaluating an offer of early retirement, and deciding that it is feasible, perhaps with supplemental income from a hobby-turned-business.
Assuming an annual inflation rate of 4.5 percent, for every $100 today, it would take $155 to buy the same goods in 10 years, $240 in 20 years and $375 in 30 years. Say a 55-year-old earning $50,000 a year is offered a chance to retire now with a full pension, equal to half his salary. Because most pensions are not indexed to inflation, the buying power of that $25,000 pension would drop to $16,000 by the time he is 65, just over $10,000 at age 75 and less than $7,000 by age 85. If he continues working until age 65, and his salary moves up with inflation, he would be earning almost $78,000 in 2001 and would have a pension of almost $39,000.
These numbers suggest that most people would need a good investment portfolio, a strong basis for believing their entrepreneurial ideas will pay off, an ability to accept a reduced standard of living or a combination if they are going to accept an early retirement offer.
One of Ms. Schaak's clients who enjoyed wordworking wanted to leave his $70,000-a-year job to open a cabinet-making shop, which might earn $25,000 a year after expenses. Combined with a pension and reduced standard of living that might work out for some people, but not for others. "I tell people to live for one year on the budget" they would have after retirement before making the decision, Ms. Schaak said.
Expenses are important in deciding whether self-employment is realistic. Mr. Nadel said medical insurance for a family could cost $5,000 to $7,500 a year, and self-employed people also need disability and possibly life insurance. Some people consider the cost of buying equipment like a photocopy and fax machine, computer and printer, and office furniture, but do not realize until they are doing without a secretary how much they have relied on one, he said, or plan an office at home without checking out zoning laws. And there are taxes, not only income tax but also self-employment tax and in some areas unincorporated business tax and commercial rent tax.
Everything considered, he said, an employee earning $60,000 may well discover it takes self-employment income of $100,000 to have the same net.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Lifted by U.S. Report On May's Increase in Jobs

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed higher yesterday after a positive report on job growth increased prospects for firm United States interest rates.
The dollar was helped by the Labor Department's report that 59,000 jobs were added to non-farm payrolls in May. The announcement was good news to currency traders because it indicated that the economy was regaining strength and increased the likelihood that interest rates would remain stable or move higher. 
 Rising interest rates support the dollar because foreigners are attracted to higher yields and they must buy dollars to purchase United States investments.
The market shrugged off the Labor Department's companion report that the unemployment rate rose to 6.9 percent last month from 6.6 percent in April. The sharp increase indicated that the economy remained weak.
Analysts said the economic news was welcomed by a market that has been bullish on the dollar. "The psychology of the market was in any event ready to buy, and the numbers just gave them more reason to act," said Walter Simon, a vice president with Bank Julius Baer & Company.
The dollar has moved higher recently amid growing signals that the economy was emerging from the recession. Mr. Simon said the dollar had reached a crossroads where the market could sell it down or push it even higher. "This is a definite decision-making point," he said.
The British pound fell against the dollar, tumbling to $1.6710 in New York, from $1.6870 late Thursday. In earlier London trading, the pound fell to $1.6710 from $1.6865.
Against the German currency, the dollar rose in New York to 1.7705 German marks, up from 1.7535 late Thursday.
The dollar also rose against the Japanese yen. In New York, it closed at 140.35 yen, up from 139.28 late Thursday. In Tokyo, before the employment figures were released, the United States currency rose to 139.39 yen from 139.25 yen, and later in London it advanced to 139.65 yen.
Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with late Thursday's prices, included: 1.5190 Swiss francs, up from 1.5040; 5.9985 French francs, up from 5.9400; 1,312.75 Italian lire, up from 1,299.75, and 1.14775 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14645.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Increases

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
Consumers increased their borrowing in April for the first time in five months, the Government said today. The report was viewed as another sign the economy was pulling out of recession.
Outstanding consumer credit rose $1.7 billion, to a seasonally adjusted $734.1 billion, after falling $4 billion from November through March, the Federal Reserve said. 
 The April increase, if continued for a year, would mean a 2.8 percent increase. Outstanding credit fell at an annual rate of five-tenths of 1 percent in March and three-tenths of 1 percent in February.
Decreases in outstanding consumer debt, which includes all consumer loans except home mortgages and home-equity loans, are rare. The drop in December was the first in nearly two years. And the four-month string of declines beginning that month was the longest period of spending restraint since 1980, when credit controls were in place.
Consumer spending represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity and its revival is considered crucial to ending the recession that began last July.
The report for April "is consistent with the notion that consumers are coming out of the shell they had slipped into in late autumn," said Robert Dederick, economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
But he and other analysts cautioned against reading too much into the report.
"It either means the consumer is getting a little bit of confidence," said Robert Brusca, an economist with the Nikko Securities Company International in New York. Or, he said, it means that the consumer is "so desperate" that he "is running up his credit card."
The biggest increase in consumer debt in April came in the category that includes credit cards, where outstanding debt rose at a 6.7 percent annual rate, to a seasonally adjusted $226.1 billion, after a 17.7 percent rise in March.
Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose at a 3.2 percent rate, to $207.4 billion, after a 9 percent drop.
Auto loans were the only category to show a decline, the fourth in a row for that category. They fell at an annual rate of seven-tenths of 1 percent, to $280.5 billion, after dropping 8.2 percent in March.

HEADLINE: Dinkins's Strategy Is Faulted Amid Bickering on Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
After a day of bitter confrontations with leaders of the New York City Council and the State Legislature, Mayor David N. Dinkins's strategy to get the city through one of its most difficult fiscal periods appears to be in tatters, labor and business leaders say.
Not only has Mr. Dinkins been unable to avert the $1.5 billion cut in city services called for in what has become known as his "doomsday budget," but after the Legislature failed, according to the Mayor, to provide $250 million in aid he had sought, he may have to slash services far deeper. 
 Some of the accusations flung at the Mayor may in the end turn out to be so much posturing, as when the State Assembly Speaker Mel Miller called the city administration stupid and the Speaker of the City Council, Peter F. Vallone, rapped his desk and asked if anyone was at home at the Mayor's office.
 
Growing Increasingly Alarmed
 But with 18 days left to the start of the next fiscal year, both labor and business leaders say they are growing increasingly alarmed over the continuing failure of a series of negotiating efforts by the city to produce any improvement in the city's fiscal outlook.
The city's best hope now is that budget vetoes by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo will reopen the entire issue of state aid, and force new negotiations. Yesterday, aides to the Governor said he was now considering vetoing as much as $1 billion in state spending to bring the budget into balance. A continuing dispute with Mr. Miller could make this very difficult.
People close to the city's fiscal situation are expressing concern. "Every day that goes by, with the city failing to act, brings the crisis closer," said Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was set up in the 1970's to bail the city out of its last fiscal crisis. "I think there has been remarkably little progress."
Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said union members are growing increasingly impatient. "You have the City Council and the Mayor and the Legislature fighting like kids in the park," he said, "while the members of our unions are swinging in the wind. These leaders of government can't put anything together."
For its part, members of the Dinkins administration continued to blame others for the stalemate, lashing out at the shoddy work of the City Council, and the unrespon siveness of the State Legislature. "I don't think that saying the Mayor's strategy is in shambles is a fair way to describe it," said Philip R. Michael, the city's budget director. "It is fair to say there is a further complication in a very complicated situation."
 
Crippling Service Cuts
 Last month, in a series of elaborate formal meetings at Gracie Mansion, Mayor Dinkins presented a $29 billion city budget with crippling service cuts -- closing pharmacies in city hospitals, turning off one of every four street lights -- but promised he would do his best to avert the worst of the cuts through a series of parallel negotiations.
But efforts to win concessions from city unions have been stalled from the first and a plan to get $350 million from the Municipal Assistance Corporation next year foundered, after bond rating agencies raised objections.
The administration was also hoping to get additional state aid to avert cuts. But on Thursday, Mayor Dinkins said he was "more than a little distressed" that the state budget passed by the Legislature not only failed to provide this extra lift, but did not even provide $250 million in aid the city was counting on to balance its budget.
And hours later, the City Council, rebuking the Mayor for his handling of the budget, said that the Council would not pass $476 million in property taxes called for in the city budget.
 
'Manageable to Unmanageable'
 If these negotiations remain stalemated, and if the economy continues to worsen, Mr. Dinkins may have to find hundreds of millions of dollars more in cuts, something that some of his advisers say may not be practical.
"The Mayor's budget could go from doable, to undoable, from manageable to unmanageable," said one business adviser to the Mayor.
The most immediate issue for the city is the $250 million it says it needs from the state budget. While Mr. Miller said that the Legislature provided $223 million in aid, the city said that most of this was earmarked for specific programs, and, could not ordinarily be used for general budget relief. Other aid was offset, the city said, by increased costs mandated by the Legislature.
This prompted Mr. Miller to call the city stupid, and for First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel to complain yesterday that Mr. Miller asked city officials to simply ignore the costly impact of the mandates and accentuate the positive.
"It was a shock to hear him say it was stupid to put together a real budget," Mr. Steisel said. "Maybe they don't do it that way in Albany, but that's the way we do it in New York."

HEADLINE: Dow Off 18.12; Week's Loss at 50.76

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Stock prices continued their retreat yesterday, with analysts citing weak bond prices and profit taking after the record close earlier in the week. The latest reading of the economy's pulse, the monthly job numbers, received a mixed reaction.
After sinking even lower earlier in the day, the Dow Jones industrial average closed for the weekend at 2,976.74, off 18.12 points for the day and 50.76 for the week. 
 In May the jobless figures rose to 6.9 percent, from 6.6 in April. In Chicago, Anthony Karydakis, an economist for the First National Bank of Chicago, said it was an optimistic sign that manufacturing payrolls rose 12,000 in May. "The next step will be hiring," he added.
 
 'We Need More Time'

But the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, Janet Norwood, was not so optimistic. "It is too soon to say the recession is over," she said at a Congressional hearing yesterday. "We need more time."
Stock turnover was moderate at 168.1 million shares, down a bit from the 168.3 million shares traded on Thursday. Declining stocks totaled 1,121 while 465 rose. Forty-six stock reached 52-week highs and seven 52-week lows.
Time Warner's stock rights offering, innovative though it is, is getting a long round of boos from Wall Street, and its stock dropped 4 7/8 points yesterday, to 94 5/8. The shares have now lost 22 3/8, or nearly 20 percent of their value, in just three days. One analyst said that the offering would sharply dilute the value of the shares.
I.B.M., which showed some strength last week, dropped sharply during the week, and yesterday it closed at 102, off a point for the day, and well under the 106 1/8 of a week ago. The company has been talking with Apple Computer, which wants to license a chip from I.B.M. At the same time I.B.M. is showing interest in some of Apple's software technology, indicating a possible working partnership. Apple closed at 46 1/8 in over-the-counter trading, off 1/2.
Sales of two large blocks of BankAmerica and First Interstate Corporation shares depressed their prices. Analysts said the selling probably came from Citicorp. BankAmerica closed at 39, off 3/8, while First Interstate fell by 3 to end at 38 3/8.
A hotel and casino operator, Promus Companies, said it was offering seven million shares of stock, six million in the United States and a million abroad. Its shares closed at 19 7/8, up 7/8.
The shares of RJR Nabisco, the food and tobacco company, rose by 1/4, to 10 3/8. David Adelman, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, cited its earnings potential and strong cash flow.
TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. priced a new common stock offering yesterday at $17.25 a share in Canadian dollars, and its shares closed at 15 1/8, up 1/2. The funds will be used for construction and investments in other pipeline projects.
 
Shares of Pfizer Decline
 A new drug, Norvasc, made by Pfizer for heart and hypertension problems, won approval by a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee, but its stock declined by 1/4 point to close at 56.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 379.43, off 4.20 points for the day, compared with 389.83 a week ago, when it was less than a point under its April record.
The American Stock Exchange's market value index closed at 369.98. A week ago it stood at 371.99. Its 1991 high came in April at 373.40 and its all-time high was reached back in 1989 at 397.03.

HEADLINE: U.S. AND KREMLIN FAIL TO CLOSE GAP ON NUCLEAR ARMS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, June 7

 BODY:
Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d failed today to resolve Soviet-American differences over a new nuclear arms treaty. Both officials cautioned that the remaining problems might not be solved in time for a planned superpower summit meeting in Moscow in June or July.
At a hastily arranged meeting at the Soviet mission in Geneva, Mr. Baker presented Mr. Bessmertnykh with a letter from President Bush containing what he said were new American proposals and Mr. Bessmertnykh reciprocated with "fresh" ideas from his Government. But afterward the two men sounded more cautious than ever about the prospects for completing the nuclear arms reduction treaty in the next few weeks. 
 It was impossible to say whether this was usual diplomatic caution or reflected a realization after the latest ideas were put on the table that the problems remaining, although technical, might not be easy to solve.
 
Bush Wants Treaty Ready
 The conclusion of the strategic arms reduction talks has been linked to the summit because Mr. Bush has said he did not want to attend such a meeting unless the treaty was ready for signing. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, on the other hand, has made it clear that he would like an early summit to gain support for the Soviet economy, as part of his effort to solicit Western aid.
As a result, the Administration has been refusing to set a firm date before the arms control accord is completed for fear of losing its most important leverage on Moscow.
It is unclear, however, how long Mr. Bush will continue to deny Mr. Gorbachev his meeting if the arms control treaty is not ready for signing. In fact, White House officials have said Mr. Bush is eager to go to Moscow, and will probably hold a summit this summer with or without the treaty.
 
Details Not Known
 The details of the new proposals included in Mr. Bush's letter were not known. The President called a high-level White House meeting on Thursday to work out differences between his advisers, principally Mr. Baker and Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, over the American negotiating position.
Mr. Baker, speaking after his two-and-a-half-hour meeting with Mr. Bessmertnykh, said that "we did not even discuss specific dates" for the meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev.
"We did discuss some of the substantive problems remaining and how we might best proceed procedurally to deal with those issues and come to closure," Mr. Baker said. "There is still a fair amount of work that has to be done before we conclude a Start agreement."
Today's meeting comes amid a flurry of diplomatic maneuvering, mainly involving Moscow's requests for Western aid for its crumbling economy. Western leaders, including Mr. Bush, have indicated a willingness to help, and arrangements are being made to have Mr. Gorbachev address the leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized democracies at their meeting in London next month. Aid would also be an important topic at a Soviet-American summit meeting.
But any large-scale Western assistance is expected to be conditioned on sweeping economic reform in the Soviet Union. Similarly, the United States could hold up a summit meeting in an effort to force Soviet concessions at the strategic arms negotiations.
 
Not Ruling Anything Out
 Asked whether the issues that needed resolving could be completed in June or July, the original target date for a summit meeting, Mr. Baker said: "We don't rule anything out or anything in. Both Presidents would very much like it if we could meet the time frame of the first half of the year, but we still have work to be done."
Mr. Bessmertnykh added: "We are realists. We have started the job, that is why we look so serious."
The two men presented each other with new proposals to overcome the main obstacles holding up the treaty. They are said to be the question of how many nuclear warheads can be deployed in each missile, and how each side monitors compliance with treaty limits. Both men declined to disclose publicly their new proposals.
In addition, they also established several means for stepping up their negotiations, either by increasing the number of experts working on specific issues or the number of meetings that their lead negotiators will hold in Geneva, where the treaty has been under negotiation since 1982. They said they had agreed to appoint a special team of experts to work on the monitoring issue.
"The two Governments," Mr. Bessmertnykh said, "have decided to concentrate on completing work on the Start treaty. The two ministers have agreed to follow the work of technical experts very closely on a daily basis for completing the Start agreement. We have outlined the objectives and ways to proceed so that the objectives can be met."
 
Working Out U.S. Differences
 Mr. Baker said the letter from Mr. Bush "evidenced the commitment of President Bush to work hard to resolve the issues remaining in the strategic arms negotiations so that the two Presidents can participate at the earliest opportunity in a summit that both hoped would take place in the first half of this year."
The Soviets have asked that a missile that can carry, for instance, 10 warheads may carry only 5 and that the remaining warheads be deployable elsewhere -- provided that the total number of warheads remains beneath the ceiling that will be set by the strategic arms treaty at 6,000.
In the past, American officials have rejected this proposal on the grounds that if the Soviets want to violate the treaty in a crisis, they would be able to use the excess capacity in some of their missiles to deploy more than 6,000 warheads.
Soviet-American differences over monitoring are less clear. What sort of transmissions the Americans seek from the Soviet missile tests, and vice versa, is a delicate matter because both sides are probably already getting data through covert means that neither Government wants to reveal.
 
Compromise on NATO Dispute
 Earlier in the day, Mr. Baker attended a closing session of a two-day NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Copenhagen, where the 16 allies managed to forge at least a temporary, face-saving compromise to bridge the widening differences between France on one side and Britain and the United States on the other over the alliance's role.
The French have essentially adopted the view that NATO's primary function has been and should remain deterrence of Soviet aggression. If that threat is diminishing, they say, then NATO's role in European defense and security should also diminish.
The United States, which dominates NATO, opposes this approach on the grounds that it is not a member of either the European Community or the Western European Union -- the principal alternative forums for developing a European defense entity. American officials say Europe cannot expect Washington to take part in its defenses without representation.
In compromise language worked out primarily by French and American officials, the NATO ministers' declaration today stated: "The creation of a European identity in security and defense will underline the preparedness of the Europeans to take a greater share of responsibility for their security and will help to reinforce trans-Atlantic solidarity."
The statement added: "However, the extent of its membership and of its capabilities gives NATO a particular position in that it can perform all core security functions. NATO is the essential forum for consultation among the allies and the forum for agreement on policies bearing on the security and defense commitments of its members."

HEADLINE: Computer Export Ban To Change

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times


DATELINE: The informal agreement is another move by the United States to create new security arrangements to address the strength of regional powers as well as any long-term strategic threat from the Soviet Union.
WASHINGTON, June 7 The Bush Administration announced today that the United States and Japan would revise their export controls on supercomputers to discourage the spread of nuclear weapons in the third world but would ease controls on sales to Western Europe.

 BODY:
 The main instrument for American-led export controls for many years has been the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls. This 17-member organization drafts rules to limit the shipment of high-technology products to the former Soviet bloc and Communist countries.
The United States and Japan are the world's only two major producers of high-speed mainframe supercomputers. They had agreed in 1984 to consult with each other before exporting supercomputers, to reduce the risk that the Soviet Union would obtain the machines.
 
 Two Broad Categories
 The export restrictions agreed upon in 1984 were applicable to all other countries, including the nations of Western Europe. The changes agreed upon in talks that ended on Thursday in Tokyo created two broad categories of countries.
Most Western allies will now be able to import supercomputers with less delay and fewer controls, said James M. LeMunyon, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for export administration. The remaining controls will focus on barring the re-export of supercomputers without the producing country's permission and on blocking access to the computers by citizens of countries that represent a national security or nuclear threat.
Shipments to these high-risk countries, particularly countries that have not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, will be subject to stricter safeguards than before, Mr. LeMunyon said. Examples of these stringent safeguards may include limitations on access, restrictions on the types of computer programs to be used and constant monitoring by security personnel.
The United States and Japan also agreed to seek the cooperation of several European countries whose industries have also developed the ability to make supercomputers. The extension of the agreement is intended to reduce the risk that third world countries will import supercomputers and use them to design nuclear weapons.
 
Talks With Other Nations
 Shinsuke J. Sugiyama, the first secretary of the economics section at the Japanese Embassy in Washington, said that American and Japanese negotiators would soon begin talking to officials from Britain, France and Germany about expanding the current agreement. Later negotiations may include Italy and the Netherlands, he said.
The current agreement does not give either country the ability to veto the other country's exports, and it is unlikely that an expanded agreement including European countries would include a veto provision, Mr. Sugiyama said. But, he added, the United States and Japan have a gentleman's agreement to respect each other's objections under the agreement, and an expanded agreement will probably allow a single country to block a shipment, even if every other country favors it.
Douglas A. Davidson, a deputy White House press secretary, said that "reaching mutually satisfactory decisions through consultations on supercomputer exports is not a problem."
American officials have repeatedly criticized Japan in recent years, contending that country had allowed the export of sensitive technologies, including the Toshiba Corporation's sale a few years ago to the Soviet Union of technology that could make submarines harder to detect.
 
Japan More Conservative
 But Japan has been more conservative than the United States about allowing exports of supercomputers to third world countries like Brazil and India, said Stephen D. Bryen, who was Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for trade security policy throughout the Reagan Administration.
"We have tended to push politically a little harder than the Japanese themselves to promote sales of these kinds of machines," he said.
Mr. LeMunyon attributed the recent sales to successful marketing by United States companies, rather than to a greater willingness by the United States than Japan to sanction such exports.
The United States and Japan also agreed in the talks in Tokyo to create two categories of supercomputers, with the fastest supercomputers subject to more controls than the merely quick. Advances in computer technology have brought rapid increases in the speed of calculations, and some computer designers doubt that the techniques involved will remain indefinitely the exclusive domain of a handful of highly industrialized countries.
The State Department and Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs led the negotiations.

HEADLINE: One-Two Punch for PC Makers

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
For years, the personal computer industry has been regarded as one of America's most vibrant businesses. It seemed to embody the American corporation's ability to innovate and to capitalize on cost-cutting research. As the industry brought powerful computers within the reach of businesses and households, bountiful profits were generated for the companies and their investors.
But now the industry, and particularly its leaders -- Apple Computer, Compaq and I.B.M. -- face a real test. A squeeze at both ends of their market has sent their profits plummeting. The question is whether they can define strategies that will help them break out of the industry stall and produce the kind of growth and profitability they are used to.
 
'The Desktop Is Dead'

"The secular problem is the desktop is dead," said Roger McNamee, an industry analyst at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. "The PC industry is mature, and MS-DOS is aging," he added, referring to the operating system that is used by the majority of I.B.M. and I.B.M.-compatible personal computers. "The only things that are growing are graphical interface, portable computers and network computing. If you don't have two out of three, you're dead." 
 Of course, personal computers -- the boxy desktop variety -- continue to sell in some numbers, but they are rapidly becoming commodity products. Buyers are frequently passing up the name brands for less expensive models. This has forced Apple, Compaq and the International Business Machines Corporation, which have commanded premium prices, to slash prices to compete with the likes of the Dell Computer Corporation and AST Research Inc., which make powerful, reliable clones.
"In the last few months we've started to see little companies like Northgate and Zeos and DTK in our survey questionnaires," said Dan Ness Jr., a researcher at a company that tracks corporate computer buyers, the Computer Intelligence Corporation of La Jolla, Calif. "A year ago if you asked me if it's a commodity market, I would have said, 'no way.' Now that people are realizing that standards are well established they are shifting whom they buy from."
As the leading desktop makers are being undercut at the bottom, they are also encountering problems at the high end of their lines. The new Intel 486 microprocessor chip has allowed them to produce desktops fast and powerful enough to compete with work stations, which are more powerful desktop computers that in the past have generally been used for engineering and scientific tasks. But the desktops are still losing out to the work stations, since the software and operating systems available for work stations are superior.
For a while, the slowdown in desktop sales was seen by many as a function of the weakening economy. But as it became increasingly apparent that the market softness was tied to more fundamental changes in the industry, the computer makers began to focus on reshaping their strategies.
"There is no question that there has been a slowdown in the industry and we don't see any signs that it's really coming back soon," said James A. Cannavino, an I.B.M. vice president and general manager of the company's personal systems division. "We're ending one era and heading into another."
One sign of that change is that archrivals I.B.M. and Apple have begun discussing a potential alliance. Last month, I.B.M.'s president, Jack D. Kuehler, visited Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. The companies discussed a variety of possible technology exchanges in personal computers. These included licensing by I.B.M. of its RS/6000 chip technology to Apple, and Apple licensing some of its software to I.B.M.
Each of these is a strength the other needs. The RS/6000 is a microprocessor I.B.M. uses in its work station business that may have applications for future personal computers.
For I.B.M., using Apple's software would allow it to try to differentiate its machines more from those of competitors. Until now, it has used software jointly developed with Microsoft, but has been unhappy that Microsoft has had so much control over the direction of personal computer software.
The source of many of the industry's current problems can be tracked to limitations found in the microprocessor chip that was the heart of the first I.B.M. personal computer introduced in 1981. At that time, I.B.M. chose the 8088 chip produced by the Intel Corporation, even though many computer experts considered an alternative chip, the Motorola Corporation's 68000, to be technically superior.
The 8088 chip could use only a limited amount of computer memory, and it seemed adequate at the time. Later, however, it became the Achilles' heel of the I.B.M. and compatible computer makers.
Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system was designed around those limits. By contrast, early work stations were built around chips made by Motorola, without the memory limits. As a result, the work station world has been able to develop more advanced software.
The conventional wisdom once was that the MS-DOS operating system, on which Microsoft and I.B.M. built the business marketplace, would last forever. But that has proved inaccurate. The traditional MS-DOS market has trailed off rapidly and the remaining upgrade business from 16- to 32-bit computers and from character-based to graphical systems based on programs like Microsoft's Windows has not covered the decline.
 
Shift Was Predicted

Many veteran industry executives said that the upheaval had been long overdue.
"I've been predicting this for some time," said Gordon Bell, a leading industry computer designer. "The surprise is that it took so long before the brutality of it happened. The guys who have gotten less efficient, like Compaq, were obvious targets."
While personal computer makers have continued to innovate, many have been slow to push beyond the original single-application uses like word processing and spreadsheets, which drove the industry in the early 1980's.
"There is a shift inside the industry," said Andrew Grove, Intel's president. "The center of gravity is increasingly moving to group or community computing."
No one seems to have been well insulated from the changes, although some of the companies hurt most say they see opportunities. For the moment, though, they are all scrambling to refashion their strategies -- restructuring, as well as looking for markets with high growth potential like mobile notebook and pentop computing.
 
Leaders Aren't Leaving
 The three industry leaders are not leaving the field. In fact all are trying to either create new markets or expand existing ones. Each is taking a somewhat different tack.
I.B.M., the most broadly diversified of the PC manufacturers, is hoping that it will be able to use sophisticated software to differentiate it from the pack of clone makers. It is gambling that a new version of its OS/2 operating system, which has languished until now, will eventually be an industry hit and permit the company to tie personal computers more closely to its large commercial systems. It has also recently entered the notebook market and re-entered the home computer market.
But Mr. Cannavino, the I.B.M. vice president, argues that his company should benefit if corporate customers shift their buying to systems that work together. "Computing in the future will require a systems and support structure that is more substantial," Mr. Cannavino said. "We have lots of experience doing this."
If I.B.M. sees its future in moving upscale, Compaq has a different vision. The rapid shift in the industry appears to have caught the Houston-based company by surprise.
Compaq originally made its name by cloning I.B.M.'s personal computer, but it has been slow to differentiate itself from the commodity part of the market. Now it is attempting to re-create the phenomenon of the clone companies with a new line of machines that will match the abilities of the work station makers.
To do this, it has struck up an alliance with 20 other computer and software companies, including the Digital Equipment Corporation, the Microsoft Corporation, Silicon Graphics Inc. and the MIPS Computer Company, to define a new standard for advanced personal computers. The group, known as the Advanced Computing Environment, has defined a new standard aimed at creating a new generation of personal computers that will share information effectively and have powerful graphics features.
Apple has yet another strategy. In October 1990, it embarked on a quest for growth in the low-cost consumer market, a strategy it has consciously avoided since its founding in 1977.
To accommodate this strategy and still squeeze out the kind of profits it made when it had the freedom to price its computers above those of other PC makers, it has had to push down costs. It has already announced that it will cut employment 10 percent. And on Friday, the company confirmed that it is considering cutting executive pay by 10 percent.
But it is exploring other new markets, too, from palm-top computers to mobile consumer appliances. It has invested in General Magic Inc., a Silicon Valley start-up led by former Macintosh developers. The company is trying to develop a portable software system that will have the same influence that the Macintosh has had on the desktop.
 
 New Uses of Computers

What will determine the success or failure of all of these efforts, industry executives say, is the degree to which these companies are able to offer significant technical innovations that permit new uses of computers. For example, with the introduction of its System 7 operating system earlier this month, Apple has a substantial advantage in developing new applications.
I.B.M. will introduce a new version of its OS/2 operating system later this year. Microsoft's competing version of OS/2 will not be available until sometime next year.
As these companies pursue their strategies, one thing seems certain: profit margins will continue to erode before new approaches bear fruit.
In fact, declining profitability is likely to be a persistent problem in the personal computer industry for the foreseeable future. The Gartner Group forecasts that beginning this year, the volume in personal computer shipments will rise 16 percent annually, from the 10 percent annual growth seen over the last five years. But it expects revenues to grow by only 13 percent, down from 21 percent annually from 1985 to 1990.

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
The fiscal problems that led Bridgeport, Conn., to file for bankruptcy protection yesterday in the Federal courts are common to many other cities and states across the nation. But municipal finance experts said it was unlikely that others would risk taking such a drastic step until it becomes clear whether Bridgeport suffers severe legal and financial repercussions.
"This is going to be a landmark case," said Robert J. Froehlich, vice president of research at Van Kampen Merrit, a Chicago-based municipal banking firm. "People will watch closely to see what happens to Bridge port." 
 It is no secret that cities like Philadelphia and New York and states like Massachusetts, California and New York face serious fiscal problems.
Short-term economic difficulties linked to a depressed national economy have coincided with a long-term shift in the mix of Federal, state and local funds. Sharp cutbacks in Federal and state aid to cities have coincided with an increase in the number and range of programs, like Medicaid, that local governments are required to provide. Over the last decade Federal aid to states and cities, adjusted for inflation, has been cut in half.
"There's a structural failure in city and state financing across the whole country," said Robert Lamb, a professor of management and finance at New York University. "This is not an isolated incident."
 
 Other Cities' Ratings

Mr. Lamb said that in the last year there have been four or five reductions in the credit ratings of cities and states for every one that has been raised.
Until this recent development, Bridgeport was rated one notch above high-yield, high-risk "junk" bonds, BBB by the Standard and Poor's Corporation and BAA by Moody's Investor Service. Richard P. Larkin, a managing director at S.&P. said other governments that carried a BBB rating include Detroit, St. Louis, Yonkers and Massachusetts. (New York City is rated A-. Philadelphia is rated CCC, a junk bond category.) Daniel N. Heimowitz, an executive vice president at Moody's, said about 15 percent of municipalities that his firm rates shared Bridgeport's BAA rating.
While Bridgeport is not alone in its financial difficulties, it is distinguished for its willingness to use the bankruptcy courts as a tool to address its financial problems. Mayor Mary C. Moran said yesterday that she did not expect the city to default on any principal or interest payments or any payments to the city's vendors, as often occurs in bankruptcy situations.
 
 San Jose School District

Instead, the filing under Chapter 9, the section of the Federal bankruptcy code that applies to local governments, seems intended as a way to renegotiate labor contracts with its municipal unions under the auspices of the bankruptcy courts.
In 1983, a school district in San Jose, Calif., also filed for protection under Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code. It continued to make its interest and principal payments. Under the direction of the bankruptcy court, the school district's contracts with the unions were renegotiated. It eventually emerged from bankruptcy and is now rated single-A by Moody's Investors Service.
It is unclear whether a municipality can get away with such a tactic, especially when it is putting at risk its general obligation bonds, which are not tied to any specific stream of revenue and which carry the city's pledge of its full faith and credit. Bridgeport is the largest city ever to file for bankruptcy protection, according to Mr. Froehlich of Van Kampen Merrit.
"I don't think bankruptcy is very attractive to most municipalities," said Mr. Heimowitz from Moody's. "Virtually all the governments we speak to would rather face up to the tough decisions and not have to turn to the courts." If, on the other hand, the court forces changes in the city's collective-bargaining agreements and the city is able to emerge untarnished from the process, "It will change the complexion of municipal-labor relations forever," Mr. Heimowitz said.
The market reacted calmly to to the news about Bridgeport's filing, perhaps because the state is challenging whether the city can make such a filing. And few municipal bond experts thought the filing would cause any long-term damage.
"The municipal bond market has been ignoring these problem cities for years," said James F. Lynch, the Santa Fe-based editor of Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory, a monthly newsletter. "We told people to sell Philadelphia three years ago."

The Economy
 The unemployment rate climbed to 6.9 percent last month, offsetting an April drop viewed as a likely aberration. But corporate payrolls rose slightly in May after seven straight substantial falls.

HEADLINE: After the War, a New Battle (May the Best Parade Win)

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
In New York City, the consumers' paradise, a mark-up is the amount added to something before it is offered for sale; in Washington, it's legislators' wrangling over a bill.
In New York, where bicoastal is a measure of status, L.A. is instantly recognized as Los Angeles; in Washington, it's a legislative assistant. 
 In New York, a continuing resolution is sticking to a diet after Feb. 1; in Washington, it's a way to keep Federal checks from bouncing.
Different cultures? Perhaps. Rival cultures? At least on one side. Take the parade, or rather, parades.
Washington originally planned its parade to honor the Persian Gulf war veterans for July 4. But when New York announced it would honor the country's warriors with a ticker-tape parade on June 10, Washington tried to steal the thunder by moving its celebration to June 8 -- although the official reason was to hold the festivities while Congress was in session.
New Yorkers like to say the move has backfired.
A long list of celebrities, starting with Bob Hope, said they couldn't make the capital's new date. Now the gala's headliners are a few billion dollars in military hardware; Barbara Mandrell, who is fast making something of a career of greeting returning soldiers with her song "Sleeping Single in a Double Bed," and the talk-radio personality Blake Clark, whose theme, according to a news release, is, "If you aren't homeless, if you aren't sick, if you have all your body parts, if you have a job, then just shut up."
But the shortcomings of its own march hasn't stopped Washington from denigrating New York's parade. Sure, New York's parade will be longer, three times as long. And almost half again as many people are expected to attend. But Harry N. Walters, president of the foundation running the capital's homecoming, dismissed New York's homecoming as little more than Podunk's effort, only bigger. "A community parade," he said with a sniff. Washington's is the national victory celebration, he said.
The jibing and jostling are only half in jest. Washington's real enemy isn't Bagdad, Beijing or some other devil of the moment, say many New Yorkers who live and work here. It is a foreign culture just 250 miles to the north: Gotham. "Some people here take a perverse delight in sticking it to us," said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican. "They revel in it."
Even the two cities' corporate cultures clash. New York's monuments are icons of the great business enterprises of the 20th century; Washington's great pretension is that personal wealth does not count.
Washington's celebrities are mainly Administration officials, regulators, lobbyists and journalists -- people who populate televised public-affairs programs that few outside the capital watch. In New York, where fame and notoriety can be interchangable, celebrities are drawn from a wider pool of glitterati and are often on everyone's lips, even while sometimes being disparaged on the programs that nobody is watching.
Anti-Gotham feelings run deep and strong here. In this football-mad town, the Giants' recent domination of the Redskins is reason enough to despise New York. But the Northeast's economic travails have raised the stakes.
 
Unabashed Schadenfreude

Instead of sympathizing with a city sharing similar urban traumas, Washington more often seems to react to New York's trials with an unabashed display of Schadenfreude. That, some legislators say, undermines New York's efforts to obtain Federal help to overcome its fiscal crisis.
Senator D'Amato said colleagues relish voting against the city, portraying their decisions as principled stands against "Sodom and Gomorrah." Bills viewed as favoring New York start off with a strike against them, while legislation that hurts the city rides an antiurban tide that has aggravated the financial problems of cities across the country.
Washingtonians concede that New York's unparalleled cultural wealth make the city a nice place to visit. "There's a love-hate relationship," said Representative Ted Weiss, the Manhattan Democrat. As usual, the annual weekend visit last month to New York by 30 members of the Congressional Arts Caucus and their spouses was a popular outing, he said. "But when we have votes for the benefit of New York, there can be difficulties."
In part, New Yorkers say, Washington's antipathy toward their city is the natural outgrowth of the cities' proximity and their distinct geographies. New York is built vertically. People are piled on top of each other, making daily confrontations between rich and poor inescapable. But Washington works horizontally. It is easier for the comfortable to isolate themselves in their well-preserved neighborhoods. As a result, New York's problems often seem more dangerous and more pressing, even though they simply may be more obvious.
So even while Washington has become a municipal Murder Inc., Washingtonians have dubbed New York "The City From Hell." "Most New Yorkers live under conditions that would cause riots elsewhere," Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post wrote last summer in a 5,378-word article celebrating his return after three years as a correspondent in New York.
 
It Started in 1790

A Brooklyn native, he confessed he would miss his hometown "terribly," but nonetheless described it as nothing less than a cesspool of greed, in which blindly ambitious cutthroats ceaselessly pursued money and were, in turn, ceaselessly pursued by criminals.
While New York politicians have recently made a mantra out of Washington's bias against their city, it dates to the political deals surrounding the Republic's founding. Under the Compromise of 1790 -- hammered out by Hamilton, Jefferson and Madison over a dinner in downtown Manhattan -- the nascent national Government assumed the debt incurred by the states during the Revolutionary War. In return, southern interests were rewarded by moving the capital to the malarial banks of the Potomac.
Separating the country's Government from its largest municipality, the emerging center of culture, commerce and finance, spawned a national schizophrenia, according to Daniel P. Moynihan, who as New York's senior Senator owes allegiance to both cities. "The culture in the largest sense was in New York; Government was somewhere else," he wrote in an essay on the subject.
In an admittedly "scrupulously prejudiced evaluation" of the relative claims to greatness, Newsweek magazine declared Washington the hands-down winner. The magazine, which has its headquarters in New York but is owned by a Washington corporation, concluded that the Big Apple is, well, the Big Apple: more fun, more diverse and more vibrant. But Washington, the magazine decided, is more powerful, has more "cosmological significance" and is a much nicer place to live.
Even Senator Moynihan now sees the competition between the two cities as lopsided: New York may have the Stock Exchange, but Washington's decisions determine the price of the country's stocks. "New York is still a great city, but slowly, inexorably, Washington becomes the greater one," he said.

HEADLINE: House Vote Sets Stage for Conflict Between Two Allies in Space Program

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
In voting Thursday to save the space station at the expense of space science projects, the House of Representatives has set the stage for a potentially bitter fight between two uneasy allies: the supporters of the manned and unmanned space programs.
The ensuing scrap may be so divisive that the space station will perish anyway. Or, all projects will grind forward with sharply reduced financing.
"It's a watershed," Dr. Bruce Murray, a former director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who is now a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology, said yesterday. "It's the end of a set of relationships that go back more than 30 years." 
 After the vote, Adm. Richard H. Truly, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, conceded that much work remained to produce a space agency budget that was well balanced between science, manned space flight, aeronautical research, earth observation and technology development.
 
'I Remain Committed'
 "I remain committed to work toward that end," he said in a statement, implying that a better balance of competing interests would be struck in the course of the budget cycle.
The Senate, with no money to spare, faces the prospect of endorsing the same compromise as the House, killing the space station in order to let the unmanned space projects proceed with full financing or finding some new solution.
Trade-offs seem to be an inevitable prospect because of last year's budget agreement between Congress and the White House. The agreement put a cap on discretionary spending and, within NASA's budget, left various space projects, each with fast-growing budgets, competing for pieces of a fixed dollar amount.
The House Appropriations Committee solved the problem by scuttling the $30 billion manned outpost, the centerpiece of NASA's plans for this decade and the next century. The Bush Administration wanted $2 billion for the station this year.
But the committee's strategy was rejected by the House on Thursday night after more than seven hours of impassioned debate and weeks of intense lobbying by the White House, officials of the space agency and thousands of contractors for the station project.
Both sides in the debate cast it in terms of having the courage on the one hand, to make hard budgetary choices in a time of financial crisis, or, on the other, to uphold a vision of national grandeur and the proud heritage of the manned space program. The latter won by a landslide, 240 to 173.
 
Pure Science Would Pay
 If the move to restore the station prevails in the budget process, the price for pure science and environmental research is likely to be high. A number of projects for which budget increases had been promised are now slated for reductions, threatening to throw them into disarray.
Under the House plan, NASA's space science and applications program for the 1992 fiscal year would be reduced $463.5 million, or 16 percent. That would be a serious blow to the $30 billion Earth Observing System, an array of satellites meant to discover how the global environment works and to document how it is damaged by human activity; to the $1.8 billion Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility, a large space-based telescope intended to peer at the most violent events in the cosmos; to the $800 million Comet Rendezvous and Asteroid Flyby, a planetary probe; and to the $800 million Cassini mission to explore Saturn, its rings and its 17 moons.
There would also be cutbacks in NASA's aeronautical research, down $79 million; academic programs, down $11 million; space shuttle operations, down $233.6 million; and other ongoing projects.
Also thrown into limbo would be proposals with no significant financing yet, including the $1.3 billion Space Infrared Telescope Facility, the fourth and last of NASA's great observatories, meant to peer into the heart of galaxies through cosmic dust.
Even before the vote on Thursday, scientists around the country were mobilizing to lobby for their favored projects.
On Monday, the University of Arizona sent out a news release warning that science cuts could leave its projects severely damaged and could have a profound impact on the university's research and training of students. Arizona scientists who watched the House debate on television were angry and dejected.
 
Science a Dirty Word?
 "The sense of the debate was that science is a dirty word," said Dr. Marcia J. Rieke, an astronomer at the university's Steward Observatory, which is working on two NASA science projects.
"That's a very depressing message," she added. "The scientists in this country have been working hard to do a good job. To have that kind of message come back -- that the country doesn't care about what you're doing or its future -- is demoralizing in the extreme to faculty and students."
In the wake of the House vote, attention will shift to the Senate, which is considered a fairly strong supporter of the station but will now be buffeted by waves of irate scientists.
Washington analysts had hoped that a bruising Senate battle could be avoided and all NASA's warring factions satisfied by a larger overall allocation for the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the space agency. But that hope was dashed Wednesday when it got only $50 million more than the House -- far short of the station's financial needs.
In their campaign against the station, scientists say a key argument will be that it represents more of a welfare program for engineers than a contribution to the cutting edge of knowledge.
"Mediocre problems result in mediocre industries," said Dr. Murray of Caltech. "Building the station will require no technical breakthroughs. Even 'Star Wars' was better than this since there was no question it was a hard problem."
 
Case for the Station
 The station's backers, including those on the House floor on Thursday, argue that in space it will be a boon for medical and industrial research and on the ground for the contractors and communities that build it. NASA says the project employs nearly 100,000 people, directly or indirectly.
An unstated rationale is that the station will keep aerospace contractors strong in a time of declining military budgets, allowing their skills to be directed back to weaponry if East-West rivalries should flare up.
If the station is endorsed by the Senate and financed in the budget now under debate, pressures on the smaller science programs are likely to get worse as work on the outpost presses ahead. Including operating expenses over its 30-year lifetime, the station's total cost has been estimated by the General Accounting Office to be $118 billion.
"Big science is really knocking out little science here," Representative Bob Traxler, the Michigan Democrat whose subcommittee originally called for the outpost's elimination, told the House on Thursday. "The space station is going to eat your dinner next year."

Arthur Ashe Confronts Apocalypse

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
We are all living in the next Spike Lee movie. To pay for the national compulsive gambling in the 80's, the New York City is talking of closing down swimming pools just in time for summer. Will the last librarian to be furloughed please turn off the reading lamp? And on the border of our city, a young black man goes to party with white friends and is hit from behind by punks, cowards, racists.
The damage, economic and physical, goes around in circles. Asians, Hispanics, whites and blacks are all being hit from behind, but one group most appears to be an endangered species from violence, from lack of jobs, from poor education, from rootlessness. 
 "I don't have to tell you there is a theory that an entire generation of young black males is being totally written off," said Arthur Ashe.
Arthur Ashe is a black man, no longer young, a tennis champion, a historian, a heart-bypass patient, husband and father. He has even been the captain for Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe in the same Davis Cup round, so we know he is a survivor.
He has always been a model American, so we cannot say that Arthur Ashe has suddenly decided to get involved. What we can say is that Arthur Ashe has a new idea. He would like to fight the apocalypse by concentrating on one very specific segment of the population: the young athletes around New York.
The beginning took place yesterday with the announcement of the African-American Athletic Association. Dick Barnett, the former Knicks star, with his doctorate in education, will be the first president. Evander Holyfield, the heavyweight champion, cared enough to appear, and the National Basketball Association cared enough to be a charter member. "This association will set a new tone for the ethos of sports in the five boroughs and the contiguous counties," Ashe said. "This is a local thing."
Why athletes? Good question. Ashe said he gets letters from black parents who resent that their children cannot get into good colleges while athletes with 700 on their Scholastic Aptitude Tests are accepted by compliant admissions directors.
"Seven hundred is ridiculous," Ashe said. "I read an article the other day about a star high school athlete who was happy he had just scored 700 so he wouldn't have to sit out a year. He shouldn't be happy with 700. He could do better. We will not hold up 700 or a 2.0 grade average as the ideal."
The way things work now, Ashe said, if you multiply the approximately 10,000 black football and basketball players in college by an average cost of $10,000 a year by an average of five years in college, "that's half a billion dollars, and only 18 percent of those athletes are graduated," Ashe added. "Something is wrong."
It is significant that more Americans know Bo Jackson, the commercial, than John Hope Franklin, the historian from Duke University who wrote the association's mission statement.
"The closest thing to a big man on campus is the athlete," Ashe said, although he's probably wrong. In some urban schools, the big man on campus probably carries a beeper and drives a Mercedes and delivers drugs. But you've got to start somewhere. And start small and local.
In The New York Times yesterday was the heartening story about Herb Crossman, a black man who gave Sam Perkins, a young man on the edge, enough stability for him to go from Brooklyn to high school to North Carolina to Dallas to the Lakers. Nice story. But does it have any relevance for all the young black men and women?
"We're going to look at three areas," Ashe said. "One, we're going to start with public policy, the budget cuts, the sponsorship by liquor and tobacco companies, and whether Proposition 48 is the right way to go. Two, we're going to do mentoring and counseling. Every study we have seen says there is a lack of black male role models. Studying is seen as a whitey thing. We are going to talk about proper speech, about the macho male image."
"And third, we are going to work in career development," Ashe said. "Our members will be people who work for a living. You know how you always hear, 'If I only knew somebody qualified, I'd hire him?' Well, we'll come up with 'em."
The association is talking to a few colleges about setting up programs. There are plans to find a few high schools that will cooperate. A few companies think they can do something.
Where could the money come from? Elliott Denman, a sports columnist with The Asbury Park Press in New Jersey, recently proposed a "sports tax" of 1 percent of all professional athletes' income. Before you could even talk about it, this new association must prove it can accomplish something. First serve, Mr. Ashe.

HEADLINE: Consumer Complaints Up, Relief Down

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
The recession has brought a steep rise in consumer complaints, but fewer and fewer of them are being addressed because financially troubled states and cities across the country have sharply reduced the budgets of their consumer agencies. The cuts are the deepest since the agencies were set up in the 1960's and 70's.
"Just at the time when we need to increase consumer protection for people getting ripped off by all kinds of phony credit-card and employment offers, consumer agencies are having their staffs and budgets cut way back," said Sara Cooper, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Agency Administrators. The association, in Washington, has members in many of the nation's 400 public consumer agencies. 
 Consumer officials say that every category of complaint tends to increase in a recession. People complain more when money is tight, businesses are less apt to make goodwill adjustments and advertisers are more inclined to stretch the truth.
"I can't tell you when we'll have money for consumer affairs," said Allan A. A. Seifullah, the press secretary to Mayor Michael R. White of Cleveland. "It depends on what happens with the economy, and the projections haven't been encouraging."
 
A List of Closings
 Cleveland's consumer agency stopped investigating consumer complaints last month, joining Boston, Dallas, Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska, in eliminating this service. Alaska has closed all seven of its state-financed consumer agencies. Suffolk County on Long Island has closed its consumer affairs department for 10 Fridays as part of countywide furloughs. Palm Beach County, Fla., has laid off two of its five investigators.
And in efforts to balance next year's budget, New Jersey has proposed reducing by 75 percent the $2 million of the state Public Defender's budget devoted to handling more than 15,000 complaints each year involving housing, education, health, AIDS discrimination, banking, children's issues, employment, civil rights and the environment.
"I tell you there is no end to the madness," said Ralph Nader, who said consumer agencies save consumers far more money than they cost to operate.
Some consumer agencies support themselves. New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs, for example, expects to collect $800,000 more in fees and fines this fiscal year than it will spend. And it projects a 1992 budget of $12.6 million and revenue of $15.7 million, said Linda Sachs, an agency spokeswoman. "We raise more than we spend, so we're not facing the kinds of devastating cuts that other city agencies are facing," she said. But the department did eliminate 16 vacant positions.
The financial problems in other states have begun to spawn solutions. Last month Massachusetts decided to make owners of automobiles that they say are defective pay $250 to $300 for the arbitration of their complaints under the state's Lemon Law.
Some branches of the Better Business Bureau, the business-supported complaint mediators in 180 cities, are proposing novel arrangements under which the bureaus would process complaints and collect fees from businesses and possibly consumers.
"In tough budget times, when governments are having to choose between basic needs, they should rely more on the private sector," said Steven J. Cole, a vice president and senior counsel to the Council of Better Business Bureaus in Washington.
 
No Help With Routine Problems
 Officials justify reductions in state consumer services by saying that consumers can seek help at other levels of government. But as local consumer agencies close their doors or reduce services, most people with routine consumer problems will have nowhere to turn for help.
Local district attorneys and state attorneys general investigate and prosecute only the most egregious cases, usually ones involving patterns of fraud or deception. In areas served by Better Business Bureaus, the bureaus are trying to pick up the slack, but many of them have also been weakened by the recession. The bureaus, moreover, have neither the power to enforce consumer laws nor the authority of a public agency to pressure a wayward merchant to provide a refund, replacement or repair.
Sylvia Director, a retired legal secretary in Palm Beach County, Fla., expressed consumer concern. "We shouldn't be reducing funding for the immediate needs of people and spending billions on things like the space station that may never benefit anybody," she said.
The county's division of consumer affairs recently resolved Mrs. Director's complaint about a camera store that had falsely advertised a sale. She objects to the county's closing a branch office of its consumer agency and reducing the agency's staff of investigators to 3 from 5.
At greatest risk are the consumer protection services in Massachusetts, which is embroiled in a two-year-old fiscal crisis. The state House of Representatives has eliminated $618,000 for 19 local consumer agencies and 5 local mediation centers.
"Nearly all consumer agencies in the state are about to close," said Susan Grant, chairman of the Massachusetts Consumers Coalition, which represents the 19 agencies. She said the agencies had answered 91,000 telephone queries this year, handled 13,000 complaints and recovered $3.2 million for consumers in refunds, replacements or repairs of defective products and shoddy services.
Ms. Grant, who is also director of consumer fraud prevention in the Northwestern District Attorney's Office in Northampton, presides over a nearly empty office. Her staff of five has been reduced to one person and a very busy answering machine, which directs callers to other agencies.
For several years Dallas has been reducing consumer services ranging from inspections of butchers' scales to reviews of charitable organizations' books. Last year, the city became the nation's first to contract with a local Better Business Bureau to handle consumer complaints, with the city paying $75 for each case.
But the city broke the contract this year to save $25,000. Now the city refers consumer complaints to state and Federal agencies as well as to the Better Business Bureau, and the bureau does the work for nothing.
 Ron Barry, president of the bureau in Dallas, said that in the first three months of this year the bureau handled 3,586 complaints, 17 percent more than the 2,960 in the same period last year. In the same period, the bureau's income from its members declined by 9 percent, to $248,000 from $275,000. Most bureaus around the country face the same pressures.
Dallas consumers find little solace at the office of the State Attorney General, where consumer complaints have trebled in recent years, to more than 800 a month, while the office's budget has remained constant, said Stephen Gardner, the assistant attorney general for consumer protection.
"Our resources are so strapped we can't sue everybody who breaks the law," he said, "and the cases we do bring are just the tip of the iceberg of criminal cases that we know about."

 
 
SMALL CUTS, BIG PAINS
Budgets for consumer agencies around the country are under review as public officials try to balance their books for this fiscal year and prepare budgets for the 1992 fiscal year, which starts July 1 in most cities, counties and states.
The reductions affecting consumer agencies are not, in most cases, disproportionately larger than those affecting other public services. But consumer agencies are extremely vulnerable because their budgets have always been so small that a major reduction in funds hurts them badly.
And when a consumer agency does cut its services, the savings to cities and states are often quite small. In Texas, for example, the city of Dallas saved only $25,000 this year when it stopped mediating consumer complaints on the repair of automobiles, homes and electronic appliances.

HEADLINE: New Rayon Clothing Ruffles Some Wearers

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
Theresa Jakubik, an aspiring actress in Manhattan, recently went to brunch with some people she wanted to impress. "I put on these adorable little culotte shorts," she said. But by the end of the day, she didn't look adorable. The rayon culottes were so wrinkled, she said, "I looked like I had rolled out of a 90-hour flight."
It wrinkles, it's no bargain, it has to be dry-cleaned, it spots easily and trees die for its birth. 
 This is the fabric of the 1990's?
Rayon, once considered a second-class fabric to be used in lieu of silk, is showing up in every kind of clothing for both women and men. Designers talk ecstatically of its drapability, of the way it follows the line of the body. They are putting it in everything from $39 blouses sold by Express to $2,000 suits by Giorgio Armani.
"We all love rayon," said Robert Abajian, senior vice president for sportswear design at Liz Claiborne .
Apparel manufacturers rediscovered rayon about five years ago and have been using it as styles have become more fluid and slinky. Its use in apparel increased by 34 percent from 1987 to 1990, rising to 150 million pounds from 112 million, according to the Fiber Economic Bureau , a company that tracks the industry.
 
The Role of Trees
 While synthetic fabrics like polyester come from petroleum, rayon comes from trees. The wood is treated with chemicals to extract cellulose, which is spun into thread. Rayon, the first fabric produced synthetically, was made commercially starting in 1891 in France. It was widely used until the 1950's, when synthetics like orlon and polyester captured the interest of manufacturers.
They fell from grace in the 1970's, when natural fibers became the rage. But synthetic fibers have been making a comeback with the resurgence of rayon and the interest in the new microfibers, which are soft, ultrathin versions of polyester.
Rayon can be found in inexpensive clothes, but it is no longer a cheap fabric. Imported rayon is subject to large duties, so clothes made from it often cost more than linen or cotton. Italian rayon is especially expensive. Production in the United States has dropped, while imports have soared, rising to 28 percent of the market in 1990, from 4 percent in 1987, the Fiber Economic Bureau said.
Designers and manufacturers say consumers like rayon for its comfort and style. And they do. But ask those who read labels for an opinion about rayon and the story gets complicated.
Michael Moore, a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology, recently wore a rayon shirt to a crowded party in a warm room. "I crossed my arms at my waist," he said, "and when I took them away, it had wrinkles." He went home and changed.
Rayon's desire to wrinkle is hardly a secret. Textbooks on textiles note that it wrinkles "when worn or crushed." The fabric lacks what experts call "memory": it doesn't spring back to its original shape.
Some rayon clothes are washable, but many must be dry-cleaned, which annoys people who believe that fake things ought to be washable. "It's the worst of all possible worlds," said Nancy Sills, a Manhattan lawyer. "It's synthetic, and you have to take it to the cleaners."
Rayon is the most difficult fabric to care for, said Jacqueline Stephens, a textiles analyst for the International Fabric Care Institute, an association of dry cleaners. "Most of the dry cleaners have a problem with rayon," she said. The most frequent difficulty involves the stiffening agents, called sizing or finish, that give the fabric its drape. Some are water sensitive, she said, and thus easily lead to permanent stains and discoloration. Rayon also tends to shrink, which is why dry cleaning is often necessary, she said. The agitation in a washing machine can contribute to shrinkage.
Manufacturers say rayon is now more practical and adaptable. But work remains. Manufacturers like the Fibers Division of BASF in Williamsburg, Va., a large maker of rayon fibers, are working on finishes that will make the fabrics more washable. Aside from their complaints about washability, consumers are very happy with rayon, the company said.
Already, the rayon clothes made for boys and young men by the H. Cotler Company are washable. That's a good thing, said Pamela Gelson, the marketing director, because otherwise, "rayon is a mother's nightmare." Whether a rayon garment is washable depends on the kind of finish, the styling and whether the rayon is blended with other types of fiber.
As recently as 1988, Cotler, a New York company, used very little rayon. Now, nearly 80 percent of all its suits, jackets, dress pants and shirts are made of rayon or rayon blends.
"The reason is the drapability," Miss Gelson said. "It feels expensive, but isn't. And it dyes beautifully. It's just gotten to be the contemporary fabric, as opposed to cotton or linen."
Rayon shows up in $20 shirts as well as in $200 ones. Mondo Inc., whose Mondo de Marco shirts retail for $95 to $150 at places like Saks and Bloomingdale's, used no rayon a few years ago but now puts Italian rayon in 30 percent of its shirts.
 
Price-Tag Shock
 Shoppers who remember rayon as an inexpensive fabric now have to look twice when they read some price tags. A simple black shell blouse from the designer Jean Muir is $770 at Bergdorf Goodman, for instance. Women's suits by Armani that are mostly rayon cost $2,045.
But in the Armani boutique at Bergdorf, the word rayon is nowhere in sight. The clothes are made of viscose, a word that refers to a solution from which rayon is made. "Viscose is a nicer word for rayon," said T. LaRossa, the boutique manager. When Armani started using viscose in blends with other fabrics, shoppers were unhappy. "They felt they should get 100 percent whatever," he said. "But over the years, customers have become more savvy."
Rayon is so popular that even its detractors feel they have to use it. Joel Benedek, whose company, Sherbrouck Ltd. , makes blouses for stores like Barneys New York, has ordered 10,000 yards for the fall, making it his leading fabric. "I have a huge demand for it," he said. "If it were up to me, I would hesitate."
Mr. Benedek said rayon doesn't clean as well or last as long as cotton, silk or linen. But maybe that doesn't matter. "No one is interested in holding anything that long," he said.

HEADLINE: Military Targets, Close to Home

 BODY:
The commission on military base closings has heard the same message from virtually every community near a base on the Pentagon's hit list: Don't close ours. But that's exactly the commission's job, to recommend which bases to shut, reduce or restructure. The commissioners have handled their unhappy task with admirable fairness so far. Now comes the hard part.
There are more than 400 major military installations in the U.S. With the coming cutbacks in forces, many will become superfluous -- if indeed they are not already so. Protective members of Congress have forced the Pentagon to keep them going at tremendous, wasteful cost. 
 Finally conceding that the waste was inexcusable, Congress created a commission in 1988 to make the first cut. Following that commission's recommendations, 86 bases are in the early stages of being closed or realigned. Now a second commission is making up a second list.
The commission is required by law to operate more publicly than the first one; that's fairer, but harder. It must make its recommendations to President Bush by July 1. He may approve or reject the entire list, or seek reconsideration on some points. If he approves, the list goes to Congress for an all-or-nothing vote.
In mid-April, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney gave the commission his proposal to close 31 bases and realign 40 others. In mid-May, the General Accounting Office skewered the Navy for not playing ball. The G.A.O. found U.S. bases with thousands of feet -- indeed, several miles -- of excess space for berthing ships, even as new home port facilities are being built.
After crisscrossing the country to hear local protests and undertaking some probing on its own, the commission published a list of 35 additional installations it would consider for closing. Following the G.A.O.'s lead, half of these were naval installations. The longer list did not mean the commission would recommend more closings than the Pentagon wants. It was mainly a public notice that the commission is weighing alternatives, which it did in more hearings this week.
The reaction of Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Republican of New York, is a sample of the heat the panel must endure. He called the new list, which included six bases in New York, "a clear and present danger to our national security." Such bombast is no help to the commission, whose task is made even more painful by the recession. Communities whose welfare has been rooted for decades in the employment and business generated by the military's presence are suddenly faced with losing it all.
That's a traumatic prospect. But the slow pace of the 1988 closings demonstrates that there is time for communities to plan the transition to other activity, and the Pentagon stands ready to help. Keeping useless bases open, whether in New York or any other state, was and is inexcusable.

HEADLINE: White House Sleaze Is Back

BYLINE: By George Miller; George Miller, Democrat of California, is chairman of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The sleaze factor is slipping back into the White House.
During the Reagan Administration, the number of ethical transgressions by high-ranking Presidential advisers resulted in dozens of resignations, dismissals and indictments. The Bush Administration repudiated such conduct, vowing it would tolerate no impropriety in the behavior and financial interests of its high officials. 
 The credibility of that repudiation was first rocked by disclosures of personal use of military aircraft by John Sununu, President Bush's chief of staff.
We have also learned that Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, whose Justice Department negotiated the settlement among Exxon, Alaska and the Federal Government stemming from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, invested $32,296 in two companies that are members of Alyeska, the consortium that owns and operates the Trans-Alaska pipeline. Coincidentally, department negotiators absolved Alyeska of all liability in the now defunct settlement.
Alyeska, which is responsible for responding to tanker accidents in Prince William Sound, has been widely criticized for its actions during the spill. Apparently, the Justice Department was unaware of, or unconcerned about, memos -- newly disclosed -- demonstrating that Alyeska misrepresented to Congress and Alaska its ability to respond to a calamitous spill, and knowingly failed to upgrade that ability.
In rejecting the proposed settlement, Judge Russel Holland said the department's inclusion of Alyeska in the settlement was "inappropriate."
Mr. Thornburgh, who calls his $32,296 "insignificant," sought and got a waiver from the Ethics in Government Act from President Bush one week before he signed the settlement. Questions about his sensitivity to ethics won't be assuaged by his dubious decision to remain as Attorney General while seeking a Senate seat from Pennsylvania.
And what about the flagrant conflicts of interest that riddle the Presidential commission on military base closings? Five of the eight members had financial links with companies that are directly tied to the Pentagon, among them military contractors and companies that clean up toxic pollution on many bases. One member, Alexander Trowbridge, has already resigned because he sits on the boards of two companies that service military bases. Two others agreed to divest themselves of investments in Waste Management Inc., a waste-removal company.
It was dismaying to learn that Jim Courter, the former New Jersey Republican Representative, while serving as commission chairman, has simultaneously been a $3,000-a-month lobbyist for Grumman, one of the largest military contractors. Moreover, he negotiated to become a consultant with yet another contractor, the scandal-ridden Northrop Corporation.
Only after public disclosure did Mr. Courter and others suspend their questionable financial relationships. If Mr. Courter had to persuade a legislator to vote favorably on a military contract, how would this wooing affect Mr. Courter's decision to close a base in that legislator's district or state?
Conflict of interest runs the risk of tainting the commission's work, because economically sound closings and reductions of bases may well be stymied.
Members of Congress, who have expressed concerns about political scheming in the Pentagon's process for selecting bases for closing, will surely question whether the commissioners made decisions free of the interests of those who have paid them salaries and dividends.
As for the sleaze factor, did the White House know of the conflicts of interest that permeate the commission and cavalierly dismiss them -- or not even bother to look in the first place? Whatever the answer, evidently the pernicious influence of private financial interest remains a problem for Republican Administrations.

HEADLINE: Corporation Payrolls Inched Up In May, After Seven Big Declines

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
In a report supporting the growing view that the economy has already begun to pull out of the recession, Government figures showed today that corporate payrolls edged up in May after seven straight substantial declines.
At the same time, the nation's unemployment rate climbed three-tenths of a point, to 6.9 percent last month, offsetting an April decline that was viewed as a likely aberration when it was released. As in March, the jobless rate is the highest in four and a half years.
But economists and the securities markets were largely unimpressed by the unemployment rate, which historically has tended to keep rising for some time after a recovery has taken hold, and focused instead on a new-found, broad stability in payroll jobs, which rose by 59,000. 
 The survey of business and other non-farm payrolls is usually considered more reliable in depicting the state of the economy than the report's survey of households, from which the jobless rate is calculated.
Interest rates rose, dragging stock prices down, on the assumption that an expanding economy could nudge inflation up and that the need for further monetary easing by the Federal Reserve has now disappeared.
 
'The Recession Is Bottoming'

"The numbers do suggest," said Karen L. Moeller, an economist for the Prudential Insurance Company, "that the recession is bottoming."
But leading Democrats, joined by various religious and antipoverty groups, seized on the rising jobless rate to express doubts about a recovery and to press legislative efforts to bolster both the economy and employment.
"The economic recession continues unabated," asserted George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, citing 8.64 million people without work and another 5.93 million part-timers who want more work.
"Each and every one of these people represents a failure of policy and it's time that President Bush acknowledged he has a responsibility to respond," Senator Mitchell said.
At the White House, the spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said that the rise in the jobless rate was unfortunate, but that the Administration continued to believe "the recession is ending and we're on the road to recovery."
Most economists are increasingly inclined to this view, with Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, contending that "either April or May" will prove to have been the turning point. He pointed, among other things in today's report, to the increase in non-farm payrolls and to a hefty, 18-minute expansion in the length of the average workweek.
Janet L. Norwood, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, declined today during her usual session with the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on the day the jobs data are released to say the recession had ended, but she noted marked improvement in the labor market. When the payroll and household figures are viewed over the latest two months, conditions are better today, she said, than earlier in 1991 and it is now clear that the jobless rate, after rising since last October, has steadied.
Most of the largest states posted statistically insignificant changes in their jobless rates last month, including New York and New Jersey, but there were big jumps in Massachusetts, to 9.6 percent from 8.3, and in North Carolina, to 6.7 percent from 5.7. The rate for Ohio dropped to 5.6 percent from 7.2.
 
 Big Drops in Past Months

The small gain in non-farm payrolls followed a revised drop of 180,000 in April and declines averaging 240,000 a month for the first three months of the year.
Goods-producing jobs, which had fallen every month for more than a year, edged up 19,000 as manufacturing and construction firmed. Total factory payrolls rose for the second straight month as laid-off auto workers returned to their jobs.
In services, job growth rebounded, with business services up 15,000 and the irrepressible health sector adding another 30,000. Employment in real estate was about unchanged, "a positive sign" for an industry that has had steady losses for a year, the Labor Department stated.
The Government's household survey showed the ranks of the jobless climbed 370,000, but to a level only slightly above that of March. The household survey is considered to be subject to greater fluctuations than the payroll data, and much of the drop in unemployment shown in the April survey was thought to be the result of a quirky set of circumstances, including an unusually large increase in people who said they were working.
Much of the overall job decline in May was among the self-employed, whose ranks swelled in April but fell back last month to January levels, on a seasonally adjusted basis. Most population groups also reversed the survey results from April, but the jobless rate for blacks has moved up steadily for three months, reaching 13 percent in May.
The number of the hard-core unemployed -- those jobless for more than six months -- continued to creep higher in May, reaching 1,028,000, compared with 628,000 a year earlier. Among the groups that today urged expanded or extended unemployment benefits were the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.A. and the Women and Poverty Project.
The department also announced that starting next month it would no longer provide employment data on military personnel because of difficulties, pointed up by the war with Iraq, with timeliness and reliability.
In all, 118,049,000 Americans held jobs last month -- 116,591,000 civilians and 1,458,000 domestically stationed members of the armed forces.

HEADLINE: Anguished Plea From Bridgeport For Fiscal Relief

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., June 7

 BODY:
Connecticut officials vowed today to block the state's largest city from becoming the first in the nation to escape the recession's pressures by seeking protection in Federal bankruptcy court.
After the city filed for bankruptcy suddenly Thursday night, state officials, who have overseen the city's troubled finances for three years, resolved to do everything in their power to have the bankruptcy papers thrown out. They then imposed their own municipal budget today, one that would close a $12 million gap by sharply cutting services and raising property taxes by 18 percent. 
 The bankruptcy papers filed by Bridgeport amount to an urban manifesto of grievance against the Federal and state governments, accusing them of leaving economically depressed and racially isolated cities to struggle alone with costly social problems.
Cities across the country share problems of this fading industrial city, but municipal finance experts said it was unlikely they would risk taking such a drastic step until it becomes clear how severe the legal and financial repercussions are. [News analysis, page 26.]
Bridgeport's Mayor, Mary C. Moran, surprised aldermen at a budget session Thursday night with her announcement that bankruptcy papers had been filed in an effort to cut through a budget crisis that threatened to slash essential services on July 1.
"Our fiscal crisis of many years has been addressed this evening in an unprecedented way," Mrs. Moran said, in announcing that Bridgeport had become the nation's first major city to seek relief under Chapter 9 of the Federal bankruptcy code, a provision written to protect local governments.
In going to court in an effort to avoid the kind of tax increase that the state board imposed today, Bridgeport said it intended to continue full payment to its bondholders and creditors. Its aim, it said, was to use bankruptcy to renegotiate "onerous and economically burdensome" union contracts.
The root causes of Bridgeport's fiscal crisis, officials said, are a state tax structure that forces cities to rely on local property taxes; binding-arbitration laws that result in expensive labor contracts; services mandated by the state but not financed by it, and the refusal of surrounding suburbs to contribute to and share the cost of social services, from affordable housing to homeless shelters to hospitals and other institutions that do not pay taxes. Bridgeport's property taxes are the highest in the state.
"The state has abdicated its responsibility to the city," the Common Council President, James E. Tansley, said today as the Council chambers were filling for a scheduled meeting of the state board, the Bridgeport Financial Review Board, which was to act on the city's budget. "Cities are becoming an anachronism in this state.
"And wherever cities in this state are going," he said, "Bridgeport is getting there first."
 
Sought State Help in 1988
 Bridgeport's finances have been overseen by the review board since 1988, when the city, facing a $60 million deficit, sought the state's help. In 1989 the city sold bonds to cover the deficit and entered a three-year plan to attain financial stability.
Unions accepted no pay increase for one year, and since then the work force has been cut by 1,000 positions, to 3,500. The Council's budget for the year beginning July 1 eliminated street sweeping and snowplowing, closed all but two parks, eliminated all recreation programs and lifeguards for the city's mile-long beach on Long Island Sound, cut the library budget by 60 percent and cut services for the city's large elderly population by 50 percent.
Still, the $308.3 million budget was $12 million out of balance. State aid had been cut, welfare costs were rising (15 percent of the city's population is on welfare), bonds had to be paid, and the Northeast's recession increasingly seemed like a final blow to a city that the economic boom of the 80's had almost entirely bypassed.
Other Connecticut cities, especially New Haven and Waterbury, were struggling with deficits, but Bridgeport had struggled so long, and had paid such high taxes for seemingly so little in services, that the initial shock of many residents to the bankruptcy news was quickly followed by relief.
"My first, gut reaction, was, 'Well, thank God, maybe we'll get out of this mess'," said Susan Powley, a part-time office manager who has kept her two children in the city's public schools and is active in the North End Association, a community group in the largely suburban area north of downtown.
"When I thought about it," she continued, "no one knows where this is leading. My personal view is, 'We will not go bankrupt -- it's a cry for help.' "
The review board had planned to meet today to act on the city's budget for the next fiscal year and, if necessary, impose one of its own. The $12 million gap in the proposed budget was the amount the Mayor had hoped to win in reduced pensions and fringe benefits for union members.
The review board sharply rebuked Mrs. Moran in January for mentioning even the possibility of bankruptcy. Today the state Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, said he would seek to dismiss the city's bankruptcy petition as soon as a judge was assigned to the case.
The board authorized him to take any action necessary to block the city.
 
Says Creditors Will Be Paid
 The state maintains that Federal and state laws require a city to be insolvent to seek bankruptcy protection, and to have authorization by its state. Bridgeport, rather than seeking protection from creditors, is assuring them that they will be paid. There is no state law authorizing a bankruptcy filing. The review board, in fact, is intended to make such relief unnecessary.
Lawyers for the city argue that they can project insolvency because of the large tax increases forecast for coming years, and that there is no law expressly blocking them from bankruptcy court.
Bond-rating agencies, on hearing of the action, lowered some of Bridgeport's $208 million in outstanding bonds to below investment grade. The Standard & Poor's Corporation, for example, lowered its rating on $77.7 million of general obligation bonds to CCC, from BBB, and placed the city on its Creditwatch list.
The rating agency took no action on $100 million more in bonds with AAA ratings, however, because they are insured.
Chapter 9 of the Federal bankruptcy law has been used mainly by small towns, utility districts and other special taxing districts.
James E. Spiotto, an expert on municipal bankruptcy law and a partner with the law firm of Chapman & Cutler in Chicago, said 1988 amendments to the Federal law allowed cities to project insolvency, if they can foresee an inability to pay debts as they mature.

HEADLINE: Argentina's President, Praised Abroad, Finds Himself in Trouble at Home

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, June 7

 BODY:
Within months of assuming the presidency of Argentina in mid-1989, Carlos Saul Menem began surprising Western officials with proclamations that he planned to reorient his country away from the inward-looking, protective policies of its former leader, Juan Domingo Peron, and open its doors to the first world.
Mr. Menem, who visited Washington soon after taking office, began referring to President Bush as his "good friend." Plans to privatize sacred Government-owned companies were announced. Relations with Britain, severed as a result of the 1982 Falklands war, were restored. Two Argentine supply ships were sent to the Persian Gulf to join the coalition against Iraq. Argentina, at least in the President's opinion, was on its way to regaining its status among the dominant countries of the world. 
 But Mr. Menem is at a crisis point in his political career. While his popularity has soared abroad, it has plunged at home. Continuing inflation, plus a series of personal scandals and allegations of corruption in his Government are leading political analysts and businessmen to wonder if his political and economic vision -- which in broad sweep has few detractors among major political figures here -- will be undermined.
 
Ratings in a Poll

"There is a danger that the public is beginning to think that perhaps he is really a frivolous man, involved in little scandals almost every day and paying attention to the irrelevant and trivial, and not to the main public programs," said Manuel Mora-y-Araujo, a political analyst and poll-taker here.
Mr. Mora-y-Araujo's polls showed that from an approval rating above 70 percent in late 1989, Mr. Menem fell as low as 24 percent in March, although he has rebounded to around 40 percent recently.
The strain on Mr. Menem and his top aides has been obvious. At one news conference in April, he said he was insulted by the barrage of questions about his personal and family life: his penchant for showing up at parties with glamorous women from around the country; the divorce proceedings with his estranged wife, Zulema Yoma de Menem, whom he locked out of the presidential palace last year; his claims that his swollen face one weekend was the result of a bee sting, instead of collagen implants to remove wrinkles.
"My life is my life and I don't want anyone to meddle," he said in a recent interview.
 
A More Contrite Approach

Still, Mr. Menem seems to have adopted a somewhat more contrite approach. In his state of the union address before Congress this year, he admitted to "having committed serious mistakes and having debts with my people" while asking for "the right to mend these errors."
"Right now we are in a time of regaining credibility," he said in the interview. "If we continue concentrating on the economic and social progress, I don't have the slightest doubt we will return to the previous numbers. If we make mistakes, we are going to fall."
Against the backdrop of decades of high inflation, the flight of private capital, huge debts, coups and guerrilla warfare, Mr. Menem's program had a rocky beginning. Only since he appointed Domingo Felipe Cavallo as Economy Minister in January have economists had any hope that chronic inflation could be brought under control, the budget deficit eliminated and economic stability restored.
He has also taken steps that have infuriated segments of the population, like pardoning former officers convicted of human rights abuses in the dirty war against leftist guerrillas in the 1970's. Many Argentines say the move was intended to placate the military establishment and provide critical military support -- the kind of backing he needed to overcome an uprising of mid-level army officers in December just before Mr. Bush's visit here.
 
Charges of Corruption

But it was not until a spate of troubles this year, particularly charges of corruption in his administration, that public opinion began to turn against him. For the first time, polls found that opposition party leaders had higher positive ratings than did Mr. Menem.
In January, there was the disclosure of a letter from the United States Ambassador, Terence A. Todman, reporting charges by the Swift-Armour Company that Government officials had solicited payoffs so the company could bring in $115 million in equipment for a meat-packing plant.
Then there was the red Ferrari 348 Mr. Menem received from Italian friends last fall, which he only reluctantly agreed was improper for him to keep.
But perhaps the strongest blow has been an investigation by Spanish and Argentine courts into allegations of money laundering by Amira Yoma, the President's sister-in-law and appointments secretary; Ibrahim al-Ibrahim, her former husband and a senior customs official; Karim, her brother, plus other close Menem aides.
Though hard evidence has yet to be disclosed publicly, "there is so much smoke, it's hard to believe there is no fire," a senior Western diplomat said.
The charges have rumbled through the Menem Government. The Vice President, Eduardo Duhalde, attacked the Yoma family, calling it a "clan," and saying it was making the Menem Government look like "a situation comedy."
For his part, while Mr. Menem has defended the Yomas, he has urged them either to leave their Government posts or take leaves of absence. Other associates and friends who have been implicated in wrongdoing have been dismissed.
He has launched a major antidrug initiative with the help of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, and an anticorruption campaign, including a large-scale investigation into the country's customs office.
In late April, he cut off one of his longstanding friends, Ramon Saadi, Governor of the northwest province of Catamarca. By presidential order he removed him from office and replaced him with a Government conservator.
The action came after Mr. Saadi failed to investigate fully the murder and rape of a 17-year-old woman, a case that has become a cause celebre here. After being ousted in Catamarca, where his family has been the dominant political force for generations, Mr. Saadi called Mr. Menem a traitor and said he should be tested for drug use.
 
'He at Least Gets Things Done'

Some analysts predict that Mr. Menem will weather the current storm, provided he is not personally implicated in any wrongdoing.
"Remember, in Argentina, what is a scandal today is outdated in two weeks," said Jorge Balan, director of research at the Center for Study of the State and Society. "Maybe we don't like the clownish things he does, but he at least gets things done. He has shown a lot of executive authority."
Some of Mr. Menem's boldest moves have been on the foreign policy front, especially the effort to reverse the country's recent history of chilly relations with the United States.
Taking on an issue delicate for any Latin country, Mr. Menem has shaped an oratory that stops short of proclaiming a desire for outright military and political alignment with the United States and Europe. Instead, he uses Mr. Bush's own term for a United States-dominated world community, the "new world order."
"Argentina was a country that was aligned with what was called the third world," he said. "But for me, there is no reason for that world to exist. We have resolved to align ourselves with the only world that does exist. And at this point, everyone knows that within the context of the United Nations, there is one country that is the leader and that is the United States. There is no doubt of this. We are in a spirit of harmony, of excellent relations. It's the best level that Argentina and the United States have had."
 
Urges Inquiry Into Cuban Rights

In addition to re-establishing ties with Britain and sending two ships to the Persian Gulf war, Argentina decided in March to support a United States-backed measure to have the United Nations investigate human rights abuses in Cuba. Argentina was the only Latin nation to support the move and met with intense criticism.
"Menem is very clever and should find a way out of this," said Jose E. Rohm, a banker who says he worked against Mr. Menem's election. "In the primaries, he had the Peronist party machinery against him. Even today, in the middle of a tough economic adjustment program and having done seemingly improper things as re-establishing relations with the U.K., privatizing the telephone company, voting against Cuba, still he is a very popular man.
"This guy has a chance to go down in Argentine history as the leader who opened this country to the outside world after a long sleep," Mr. Rohm said. "My gut feeling is that he is not so stupid as to gamble that away for girls, Ferraris and some cronies."

HEADLINE: No Funds, No Planes: It's Baltia Air!

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Igor Dmitrowsky, the founder of Baltia Air Lines, looked over his bare new office yesterday in Terminal 1 of John F. Kennedy International Airport. Soon it will have a phone and desks, so this Latvian immigrant will no longer have to run his international airline out of his apartment in Rego Park, Queens.
 Baltia as yet has no planes, no flight crews and no financing. But it has had, as of Wednesday, valuable rights from the Department of Transportation to fly from New York to Leningrad and Riga, Latvia, with connections from Riga to the Soviet cities of Kiev, Minsk and Tbilisi. 
Baltia is largely the creation of Mr. Dmitrowsky, 37 years old, who left Latvia 15 years ago. An amateur pilot, his main business experience has been working for a small producer of garden tools and plumbing equipment, and founding the American Kefir Company, which makes a yogurt drink of the type popular in parts of the Soviet Union and the Middle East.
 
Job One: Raise Some Cash
 Now, he is set to join Pan American, T.W.A. and American Airlines in flying between the United States and the Soviet Union.
 As the president, chairman, chief executive and 64 percent owner of an upstart airline, Mr. Dmitrowsky's first task is to attract financing. Steffanie J. Lewis, the airline's general counsel, said Baltia had persuaded the Delaware Department of Insurance to authorize a $50 million loan from insurance companies that have contributed to an economic development fund. Baltia might locate some of its operations in that state.
 She said the insurance companies themselves had not yet agreed to extend the money. She added that other groups, including one called Eyes of Texas Aviation, had expressed an interest in giving financing to Baltia, with enough money to buy, perhaps, several year-old Airbus A310's.
 "Baltia is not keeping its eggs in one basket," she said.
 Although Mr. Dmitrowsky has no airline experience himself, failures and cutbacks among other carriers have left many seasoned airline executives ready to take a chance.
 Anthony J. Hanson, the executive vice president of Baltia, worked for Orion Air, a cargo carrier, as chief pilot and vice president of flight operations. Harold J. Pareti, who helped start People's Express and Presidential Airlines, both start-ups that failed, is vice chairman and acting vice president of finance.
 Ms. Lewis herself founded Parkair, an Alaskan carrier that had 25 small planes, she said, before it was taken over by another airline. She said she was among 23 employees, who have been working for stock in the company rather than salaries.
 Mr. Dmitrowsky said he was a maverick even as a youth in Latvia. Unlike his classmates, he said, he did not join the Young Communist League, and he dreamed of emigrating to the United States and striking it rich. "I was a nonbeliever, which was a rarity among young people then," he recalled.
 Mr. Dmitrowsky at first saw himself as more a technician than an entrepreneur. When he came to New York, he took science courses at Queens College at night. During the day he worked at Durst Industries, a small maker of garden tools and plumbing equipment, helping to develop new products and manage its plants.
 But he decided science and technology were not for him. "I wanted to be a businessman," he said, "not an engineer."
 He set out on his first venture in 1979, founding the kefir company. He employed about 30 people before he sold the company in 1981. "I'm well-off," he said, but no millionaire.
 In recent years he has tried without success to develop a new single-pilot aircraft. Since 1989, he has devoted all of his time to setting up Baltia, working from his home. "I didn't want to pay $50 a square foot" for offices, he said.
 
Judge's Recommendation
 So far, the airline's only assets are its hard-won routes. A Federal administrative law judge, Robert Barton, recommmended in February that new routes go to American Trans Air, an experienced charter line that had planned to fly from Philadelphia to Riga three times a week.
 Baltia, the judge said, had "no operating experience, no name recognition and no marketing organization." He added, "It does not behoove the U.S. to select an inexperienced, fledgling airline to compete in such a highly visible market with entrenched and strong foreign carriers."
 The judge did say he was attracted by the number of flights and destinations that Baltia was planning. Baltia said it would lease two Boeing 767's to fly from New York to Leningrad and Riga, plus two Boeing 737-200's for connections from Riga.
 In his ruling on Wednesday, Patrick V. Murphy, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Transportation, said Judge Barton's concerns had been misplaced. Mr. Murphy saw Baltia's application as a chance to start a new airline and increase competition.
 Under an aviation agreement reached by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1990, he also gave Soviet routes to Trans World Airlines and American Airlines.
 Several airline analysts give Baltia a chance to get off the ground by next year, but questioned whether there were enough Americans of Baltic descent to make a hub in Riga profitable. The analysts did say that a new airline would benefit from a surplus of aircraft available for leasing on generous terms.
 But the record for start-ups has been dismal. Only two carriers of any significance -- Midway and America West -- remain of the nearly 200 that began operating after deregulation took effect in 1978.
 
SOFIA-NEW YORK FLIGHTS
 WASHINGTON, June 7 (AP) -- A new Bulgarian airline will begin direct service between New York and Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, under an agreement announced today by the Transportation Department. The agreement allows Jes Air to fly the new Sofia-to-New York route, providing the only direct service. No United States airline serves Bulgaria. Jes Air has one Airbus A320 aircraft.

EIGHT HANDS ROUND: A Patchwork Alphabet. By Ann Whitford Paul. Illustrated by Jeanette Winter. (HarperCollins, $14.95.) Only incidentally an alphabet book, this sampler uses 26 quilt patterns to piece together a charming history of quilts and the early American life that inspired them. The illustrations, boldly colored and gently washed out, are just right. (Ages 8 and up)
THE FROG PRINCE, CONTINUED. By Jon Scieszka. Illustrated by Steve Johnson. (Viking, $14.95.) Now a nice yuppie-looking man in a suit and tie, the unhappily married Frog Prince packs his bag and leaves, but the witches he meets are apparently heavily influenced by Stephen Sondheim. The illustrations are witty and spooky at the same time. (Ages 5 and up)
LYDDIE. By Katherine Paterson. (Lodestar, $14.95.) The battleground is the Industrial Revolution in America, specifically the mills of Lowell, Mass., in the mid-1840's; and the heroine, Lydia Worthen, is in many ways larger than life in order to endure what she endures.

WHEN A.T.&T. PLAYS HARDBALL

BYLINE: BY L. J. DAVIS; L. J. Davis is a frequent contributor to this magazine.

 BODY:
Standing on the stage of the Arie Crown Theater in Chicago's McCormick Place convention center on April 17, addressing his stockholders, the 56-year-old chairman of A.T.&T. sounded a plaintive note as he described the uneven course of his attempt to buy the NCR Corporation. "What we had hoped for," said Robert E. Allen, "was a heady courtship of wine and roses, and a quick elopement." What he had experienced, far from a smooth romance, was a very public dust-up in which the object of his affection had told him in no uncertain terms to get lost.
Yet even on this April morning, several months after A.T.&T. had made its first concrete offer and been turned down, one could detect a note of surprise in Allen's voice. The leaders of American Telephone and Telegraph had expected that NCR would welcome their bid, and some of them were said to believe that NCR might be tailoring itself for an A.T.&T. merger -- a notion that Charles E. Exley Jr., the 61-year-old chairman of NCR, attributes to "self-hypnosis." 
 Such surprises and confusions were commonplace during the long struggle, which ended May 6 when NCR agreed to be acquired for some $7.4 billion in A.T.&T. stock. Sometimes the action seemed drawn from Saturday morning television as the giant A.T.&T., like Wile E. Coyote, lunged at its much smaller target, only to crash in a heap on the spot the NCR Road Runner had just vacated.
In November 1990, Exley flew into New York from his Dayton, Ohio, headquarters for an appearance before the A.T.&T. board, hoping to persuade the directors to drop their takeover efforts. "I explained our program for the 90's," he recalls, "and I must have gotten carried away with enthusiasm. When I sat down, one of the directors said something like, 'This presentation has certainly convinced me that the acquisition of NCR is a very good idea for A.T.&T.' "
For the business community in general, and Wall Street in particular, the merger raised a number of intriguing questions. Did it signal a return to the proxy contests that gathered steam in the 70's and gave way to the junk-bond-fueled raids of the late 80's? Has the country entered a new period of strategic "industrial" mergers in which companies are purchased to be kept and nurtured rather than to be sold piecemeal for short-term gain? How will institutional investors, major players in the A.T.&T.-NCR battle, use their ever-growing power?
But there is another question of far broader import. NCR was a well-managed, highly profitable enterprise, the fifth largest computer manufacturer in the nation. During the 1980's, the 106-year-old company, long known as National Cash Register, had done what American companies are supposed to do, and so few actually did. The foreign sales of its respected products contributed substantially to the nation's lagging balance of trade, it had bet the company on the development of a widely admired new series of computers -- and all without sinking into major indebtedness.
To an important degree, NCR's defense against A.T.&T. centered on the theory that the company was responsible to its "stakeholders" -- not just shareholders, but customers, employees, suppliers and the Dayton community. In Exley's view, the success of his company stemmed directly from its success in satisfying the needs of all these constituencies. The question: Why does an NCR have to lose its independence?
A.T.&T. just wanted to be friends. The dignified and image-conscious company long known as Ma Bell had never attempted a hostile takeover. In July 1988, Allen and Robert M. Kavner, the head of A.T.&T.'s computer division, brought Exley a proposal to merge the two companies. "They said we were the key to their success in the computer business," Exley recalls. Since 1984, A.T.&T. had lost well over $1 billion in its computer operations. The division had never enjoyed a profitable year; it had never even had a profitable quarter. "We didn't see that they would add anything to the picture," Exley says.
Kavner was back in Dayton in June 1989 and received the same answer. Eighteen months passed. Then, on Nov. 8, 1990, a press report stated, inaccurately, that the two companies had entered merger discussions. At NCR, the suspicion grew that the story had been planted by A.T.&T. (though to this day, A.T.&T. professes its innocence). The suspicion also grew that A.T.&T. was trying to buy NCR on the cheap. NCR's stock price had been depressed since the 1987 market crash, and had been further depressed in the general decline of stocks following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The possibility of a merger acted as a positive tonic: Over the next several days, the price of NCR shares, which had been languishing at 48, jumped to 53 7/8.
Six days later, A.T.&T. invested the rumors with substance. Meeting through dinner, the board approved Allen's plan to acquire NCR in a friendly $85-a-share stock swap. At 9:30 the next morning, Allen telephoned Exley in Dayton and asked for a meeting on "an urgent basis." When Exley suggested sometime the following week, Allen responded, "I mean urgent. Today or tomorrow."
Exley obligingly booked a room in his secretary's name at an airport hotel in Cincinnati, and drove to the 3:30 meeting that same day in his wife's Lincoln. Allen, slight and tense, a professional manager who had spent his working life with A.T.&T. or its regional telephone companies, made his pitch over coffee and cookies. The urbane Exley, who had come up through the financial side of the business, was normally the most communicative of men. Today he was noncommital.
Back at the A.T.&T. complex in Basking Ridge, N.J., a highly placed executive interpreted Exley's use of the family car, rather than a company car, as a sign of his eagerness to strike a deal; it was hailed as a "buying sign." But Exley, as it happened, almost never used a company car. He had driven his wife's Lincoln because it had a telephone.
When the NCR board met on Nov. 21, the cash register emphatically rang up "no sale." The board approved enhanced golden parachutes to Exley and his top talent; if A.T.&T. bought the company, these executives and scientists so essential to the future of NCR would now have additional incentive to bail out.
In 1884, A young merchant named John H. Patterson received his mother's permission to use part of his legacy to buy the patent for a machine called Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier, the first practical cash register, and to manufacture it. He proved to be a progressive employer, building a light and airy factory, pioneering in health care and employee education and weaving NCR tightly into the life of his home city. During the great Dayton flood of 1913, one of the city's defining events, Patterson ordered his workmen to build boats out of packing cases and transport survivors to the highest spot in town. Over the years, the company generously supported local institutions; volunteerism was an important part of the company culture. With 5,400 local employees (out of 55,000 worldwide), NCR is Dayton's largest corporate headquarters.
Like Singer with its sewing machines and Gillette with its razors, NCR was an American icon. But in the 1970's the company almost missed the market in electronic cash registers. Executing an abrupt 180-degree turn into the new technology, NCR closed factories and dismissed more than 12,000 employees, another defining event for Dayton. But the maneuver was successful.
By the end of the decade, the company had introduced its point-of-sale terminals and automatic teller machines, which today account for 25 percent of NCR's business. The company went on to manufacture lines of personal computers and minicomputers and dabbled, none too successfully, in mainframes. "We have reinvented ourselves several times," says Exley.
He had accepted the presidency of NCR in 1976 after 22 years at Burroughs, the Detroit office equipment manufacturer. And as the 1980's progressed, and Exley rose to be C.E.O. and chairman, it became clear that the company would have to come up with something entirely new in computers or it was going to have to get out of the business entirely. "In a sense, they were on the verge of collapse," says Judith Hurwitz, an analyst with Patricia Seybold's Office Computing Group. "They had mainframes that nobody wanted anymore. The minicomputer business was dying. They had no software to speak of."
In the beginning, a company computerizing its operations would buy a costly mainframe, usually from I.B.M. or the Digital Equipment Corporation. The software used by the computer was proprietary, which meant that machines manufactured by one company could not work with machines manufactured by another.
There had to be a better way, and the rapidly evolving computer industry (where product cycles can be as short as nine months) eventually found one. Instead of the mainframe, which served as an electronic office manager, small desktop computers could be linked together in a network. The participants in the network, no matter how widely scattered, would share the services of small, speedy, comparatively inexpensive computers that specialized in a particular task or in data storage.
This "open-systems" approach was adopted by NCR, among others. In its latest reinvention, the company set about developing a line of machines -- the Series 3000 -- an extended family of products ranging in price from $2,500 to $10 million. The open operating system NCR selected, as it happened, was based on the popular Unix software that A.T.&T. had invented. Indeed, NCR chose the very version of Unix that A.T.&T. was using in its own machines, a circumstance that not only made NCR an attractive merger partner for A.T.&.T. but also suggested that Barkis was willin'.
Exley had bet the company on a bold leap into the new technology. He calls it "the most exciting business opportunity I have seen in my 36 years in computing." Moreover, in the view of Rick J. Martin, an analyst with Prudential Securities and a former I.B.M. executive, "This was Exley's chance to say to the historians 20 years from now that Chuck Exley was more than a bean counter. He was a computer person." The first Series 3000 machines were rolled out last September.
With negotiations between NCR and A.T.&T. at an impasse, Robert Allen went public on Dec. 2, 1990, announcing a $90 all-stock offer that was clearly designed to increase the pressure on Exley and his board. The offer was good until Dec. 5, a day when many things happened. The NCR board met and strengthened the company's poison pill defenses. The directors also decided to ignore A.T.&T.'s request that NCR remove itself from the protection of the Business Combination Act of Maryland, where NCR had been incorporated since 1928; under that act, an acquiring company with less than 80 percent of a target company's stock could not take control for five years.
And on that same day, in the New York offices of Weill Gotshall and Manges, NCR's counsel, Exley met with Allen and informed him that NCR would agree to be bought -- at $125. In a "Dear Chuck" letter, Allen responded that he could not understand how a merger that would be a disaster at $90 would somehow succeed at $125. In fact, Exley had not wavered in his opposition to the sale of the company, but he and his board also had a legal obligation to their shareholders: the board had to sell the company if A.T.&T. offered, in the directors' judgment, a reasonable price. And on Dec. 5, the "reasonable" price was $125.
The following day, A.T.&T. publicly tendered for all of NCR's stock, offering $90 a share in cash, and Exley immediately took personal command of the public battle. "I basically cleared my calendar," he says, "and turned over the running of the company to Gil." Gilbert P. Williamson, NCR's president, had already been designated as Exley's successor. The lawyers, bankers and public relations counselors were kept in the background. Exley knew that the struggle, with its inevitable lawsuits and billingsgate, could distract his employees, destabilize his company and even drive away customers. "We moved immediately to isolate the company from the crippling effects of the battle."
One of Exley's principal tasks was to lobby the institutional investors, the pension funds and insurance companies that owned 75 percent of NCR's shares. He personally visited the 40 largest investors. "I guess I'd have to say our biggest problem was our institutional investors, who in some instances were very anxious for us to sell at a price that our board felt was far below the real value of the business."
And Exley's constant use of the stakeholder concept as a defensive weapon in interviews and advertisements proved to be a powerful irritant in some quarters. "NCR aggravated so many people with that stuff," says Louis Lowenstein, director of the Columbia University Center for Law and Economic Studies. If customers, suppliers and employees have significant rights, he adds, "you are no longer accountable to the owners of the business. It's like saying you can operate in the capitalist system without being accountable to the capitalists." Exley acknowledges that some of the institutional investors held similar views.
Nor was Exley's mission made easier by the fact that a number of the institutions had substantial holdings of both A.T.&T. and NCR. "These people were put in a rather strange position," he says. "One of them believed that the merger was inevitable and not a good thing. But if you had eight times the investment in A.T.&T. as in NCR, they explained, then you would vote your NCR shares in a manner that would provide the lowest possible price for NCR. The logic is inescapable, but how this all reads on shareholder rights, I'm at a loss to say."
Allen, too, made the rounds of the large institutional investors, where he emphasized that his company had said from the very beginning that NCR would remain in Dayton, would remain autonomous and would run A.T.&T.'s computer business. It would be a reverse takeover. Yet at the California Public Employees Retirement System, as elsewhere, he found himself on the defensive. According to DeWitt Bowman, the fund's chief investment manager, Allen spent considerable time countering Exley's vigorous arguments -- an unaccustomed role for the chairman of a utility that had for so long operated in a protected environment. In the end, the fund voted with A.T.&T.
In appearance, demeanor and background, they were an ill-matched pair. The patrician Exley, a first-generation American, was born in Detroit in 1929 to a Canadian mother and a Trinidadian father who was a sugar merchant of English descent. Exley majored in economics at Wesleyan University and took his M.B.A. at Columbia University. The youthful-looking Allen is Midwestern to his fingertips, a native Missourian who grew up in Indiana. His parents were in the retail clothing business. Allen graduated from Wabash College in 1957 with a major in political science.
During the takeover fight, Allen was far from pleased when his company was labeled a "predator" in the press. Like so many A.T.&T. lifers, he was devoted to what he called "the integrity of the brand name." Directly out of college, he had joined Indiana Bell and risen slowly through the ranks of the regional operating companies, finally becoming chairman of the Chesapeake and Potomac. In his next posting, to A.T.&T.'s New York headquarters in 1983, Allen's rise was meteoric. Within four years, he went from executive vice president to president -- in part because of his willingness, then rare at A.T.&T., to trim staff dramatically. He was thrust into the chairman's job in April 1988 upon the unexpected death of James E. Olson.
In the course of the merger battle, A.T.&T. was often called "aggressive." Allen did not mind. He believed the word accurately described the company he is reshaping. The company he inherited, on the other hand, was a beleaguered world leader in telecommunications, manufacturing and research whose over-staffed and cumbersome bureaucracy was a legacy from its days as a monopoly. On Jan. 1, 1984, acting on a Federal court order, A.T.&T. had divested itself of its regional telephone companies and begun the long struggle to adapt to a newly competitive marketplace. "I think what's happening in Eastern Europe is in the category of what A.T.&T. had to do," says Kavner.
Allen broke the company into 20 entrepreneurial units. He eliminated thousands of jobs. He transferred thousands of employees into the sales division, halting the erosion of the long-distance telephone business. Last year the company launched a new bank card, called the A.T.&T. Universal Card, that swiftly became the fifth most popular in the nation. "There's no question in my mind that A.T.&T. has turned the corner," Allen says. "We have learned from our environment and we have a deep respect for our competition."
But there was one environment that proved remarkably uninstructive. As a result of divestiture, A.T.&T. had finally been allowed to make its entry into the computer business. Ultimately, the company believed, it could create the long-awaited connection between computing and telecommunications that would make computers literally as easy to use as the telephone and would reward the company with a huge international business. A.T.&T. set out to challenge I.B.M. But A.T.&T. had almost no computers to sell, a problem it tried to solve by forging a series of alliances with four companies that did.
The new machines -- primarily PC's and minicomputers -- did nothing that I.B.M. machines could not do, and typically they were more expensive. Furthermore, A.T.&T. did not know how to sell them. Says Charles Ferguson, a computer authority at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "Everything A.T.&T. has done to stay in the computer business has been kind of irrational."
Under Allen, important elements of the company's computer strategy changed. While A.T.&T. continued to pursue commercial and government contracts for its existing machines, it also began emphasizing open systems in its marketing efforts. The strategy, identical with NCR's, finally seemed to make possible the elusive linkage of computing and telecommunications. There was only one problem: A.T.&T. was not nearly as adept as NCR at marketing the new machines and software.
At the A.T.&T. annual meeting in April in Chicago, an employee stepped into one of the four phone booths from which stockholders could ask questions. "In buying NCR," he said, "you're saying the NCR people are better than A.T.&T. people." Allen did not answer directly, but many industry analysts believe that this was precisely the statement A.T.&T. was making with its relentless pursuit of NCR. After years of losses, the purchase of NCR represented A.T.&T.'s best hope of remaining in the computer business.
The analysts also identify a number of other motives:
* NCR, with 1990 revenues of $6.3 billion, was far smaller than A.T.&T., with revenues of more than $37.3 billion. But NCR's 1990 earnings of $369 million would have been more than enough to offset A.T.&T.'s losses in the computer business that year -- an estimated $200 million. Allen denied that this fact had any bearing on the merger. "Acquiring NCR," he said, "has nothing to do with getting us out of our computer losses. That's Chuck Exley rhetoric."
* Sixty-two percent of NCR's business was transacted abroad. Given the company's adept foreign sales force, NCR offered A.T.&T. a far greater global presence than it had been able build on its own -- and an opportunity to increase considerably the export of A.T.&T. products.
* A.T.&T.'s computer business had never been able to significantly exploit the discoveries of Bell Laboratories. It was possible, as Allen repeatedly suggested, that the much more tightly disciplined NCR computer operation would find many commercial opportunities in Bell Labs. Not everyone agreed. "Just because I might want to see what's inside Bell Labs," said Philip M. Neches, NCR's chief scientist, "doesn't mean I'd want to use any of it."
Allen saw the advantages of a merger. Exley saw disaster. When he appeared before Allen's board last November, he described 13 computer company mergers, all of them failures. NCR, Exley believed, could continue to introduce its new products or fix A.T.&T.'s computer business, but it could not do both. "I told Bob Allen," Exley says, "your outside advisers, the bankers and lawyers, aren't going to be around to pick up the pieces when it's all over. It's going to be you."
On Jan. 16, A.T.&T. announced that stockholders had tendered approximately 70 percent of NCR's shares. It was far more than enough to allow A.T.&T. to launch a proxy fight aimed at overthrowing NCR's board. The issue would be decided at a special NCR shareholder meeting called for March 28; even if A.T.&T. failed to win the 80 percent vote required to overthrow the 12-member board, it would have more than enough votes to replace the four directors, including Exley, who were standing for reelection. The NCR board countered by voting itself the power to expand by four seats, and, on Feb. 20, establishing an employee stock ownership plan that would give its presumably loyal work force 8 percent of the company. (Almost a month later the plan would be overturned by a Federal judge who proclaimed that it made a "mockery" of the shareholder voting process.)
For weeks on end, the companies exchanged the usual takeover lawsuits, yet apparently nothing else was happening. Then on March 7, at a meeting with securities analysts, Exley seemed to concede that he had lost hope of keeping his company independent. Early in the battle, he had told his employees that 90 percent of all companies under attack could not ride out the storm. He had hoped to be the exception, even though an A.T.&T. purchase of NCR was inevitable if A.T.&T. stayed the course and offered a reasonable price. A.T.&T. had stayed the course, although it had not yet offered NCR's board a price it considered reasonable. But there was a limit to NCR's endurance. "I began to be concerned that this battle was going to damage NCR," Exley recalls. "As soon as I got that in my mind, I felt we had to go for a transaction."
Allen, too, felt that it was time to close the transaction. On the afternoon of Sunday, March 10, he called Exley at his Dayton offices. The fact that the call was placed would later prove to be the only thing the two could agree on. Exley says Allen told him that A.T.&.T. had considered raising its offer, had decided not to and would soon issue a press release. When the press release reached him by fax later in the day, Exley says, he learned for the first time that A.T.&T. was prepared to offer $100. But Allen maintains that he had told Exley what the offer was and that Exley had turned it down. To this day, neither man can explain the discrepancies.
In the Dayton community, the predominant reaction to the proposed merger had been dismay. The Lieutenant Governor had suggested that A.T.&T. "reach out and touch someone else." Two local banks had taken out a full-page newspaper advertisement that included the telephone numbers of MCI Communications and U.S. Sprint.
"This is a community where all the action players communicate with each other very easily," says David H. Ponitz, the president of Sinclair Community College. "Put this in the context of A.T.&T. Say I need $5,000 and I go to a branch office. They recommend it to somebody somewhere else who doesn't give a damn about the community, has got 15 other requests on his desk, and has no idea how to prioritize them."
County Commissioner Charles J. Curran takes a similarly bleak view: "There'll be a lot of receptions and a lot of coffees and a lot of promises about how their commitment will never change, but the commitment will change."
Still, remarkably few people in Dayton wanted to antagonize the possible future owner of the city's crown jewel. Instead of a protest rally, the University of Dayton organized a "Salute to the People of NCR."
Elsewhere in the stakeholder constituency, some of NCR's customers saw no benefit for them in the merger. For example, David V. Evans, a vice president with J. C. Penney, headquartered in Plano, Tex., said his company, which has 25,000 NCR point-of-sale terminals and 17,000 more on order, saw no particular advantage in the merger. "We already use A.T.&T. and we also have a contract with MCI," he said. "It's a competitive environment. We find it attractive."
On March 25, Allen and Exley met in New York for five hours. But any chance of reaching an immediate agreement collapsed the next day when each side accused the other of refusing to negotiate. Allen had wanted to discuss the financial details, particularly the dangerous golden parachutes. To Exley, it was important to explain why NCR was worth far more than $100 a share. On March 27, when Exley announced that NCR would accept $110 a share, and nothing less, Allen says he felt it was nothing but an attempt to manipulate the vote at the NCR shareholder meetings the next day. In the event, A.T.&T. was able to replace four directors, but fell short of its larger goal to replace the entire board.
In the days following the meetings, talks resumed. "I thought we were going to move forward to a swift conclusion," says Exley, "which proved to be a mistake in judgment on my part." On April 4, Allen and Exley met again over coffee and cookies in Exley's New York hotel room. Exley said he could not take a price of less than $110 to his board.
When the meeting broke up, no agreement had been reached. "After April 4," Exley said, "things seemed to stop."
Finally, on April 21, the six-month drama approached its inevitable end. A.T.&T. came forward with a $110 all-stock offer. According to Allen, the new bid was made possible by a surge in the price of A.T.&T shares. Yet even then, there were details to be hammered out.
At 11:30 A.M., May 6, in A.T.&T.'s Chippendale skyscraper on Madison Avenue, the agreement was signed. All incompatibilities between A.T.&T. and NCR had miraculously vanished. NCR would administer its own charities, future computer products would bear the NCR name and NCR would decide what -- if any -- A.T.&T. products would be maintained. Or so A.T.&T. said. Exley had agreed to become chairman of the transition planning committee; then, as he had always insisted during the long struggle, he would retire.
Four days after the signing in New York, Exley found himself in a reflective mood. "Standing in the A.T.&T. boardroom where I had made my presentation in November," he said, "I felt that I had come full circle. There was a real sense of relief that at last the thing was over." He was delighted that his executive and scientific teams had remained intact. "We haven't lost a soul. And let me tell you, the headhunters have been calling our people."
Exley singled out his directors for special praise. "Our board had the courage of lions," he said, "and they were absolutely determined that the company was not going to be sold on the cheap. They received all sorts of letters from institutions urging them to sell at $90 a share. They never wavered."
Months before the agreement was reached, A.T.&T. had clearly been preparing to hand over its computer business to NCR. The computer division eliminated a tenth of its 10,000 positions. Senior managers were shifted to other positions in A.T.&T. while middle managers were offered generous bonuses to remain behind and hold the division together until the merger occurred. A.T.&T. also promised to set up "gatekeepers" to shield NCR from any surviving imperial impulses at A.T.&T., and to assign a senior executive to listen to NCR's complaints, if any, and report back to Basking Ridge.
As co-chairman of the transition committee, Exley pushed for an unusually rapid integration of the two companies. "We're trying to do something difficult here, and speed is very important," he says. "I believe it is the best method of preserving the values, particularly the values on the A.T.&T. side. They have important customer relationships, and we've got to give assurances to those customers. They've got valuable people, and we don't want those people to go drifting away."
No matter how carefully the companies are combined, serious doubts remain about A.T.&T.'s ability to achieve its ultimate strategy, the linking of telecommunications and computers. It has never worked before. "There is no model for success," says the analyst Judith Hurwitz. "I.B.M. tried it, Hewlett-Packard tried it, Trident tried it a couple of times. There is mistrust, there is cyberphobia, between the communications side of the house and the computing side. It has nothing to do with how well the technology works."
As an episode in the annals of high finance, A.T.T.'s successful attack says much about the changed merger environment. In dramatic contrast to the well-publicized feeding frenzies of the 1980's, the deal was not characterized by heroic investment banking and the posturings of M.&A. lawyers. Instead of the high-priced advisers, the companies themselves controlled the shape of the deal.
In some ways, it is as though the 1980's never happened. In the absence of the torrents of cash provided by ever-more-risky issues of junk bonds, the preferred method of taking over a reluctant target has become, once again, the tedious and far-from-certain proxy fight. There was much about the deal that was specific to the strategic needs of A.T.&T., but the few large takeovers that have occurred since the collapse of the junk bond market in 1989 have been similarly driven by strategic needs. Unlike mountains, these companies were no longer assaulted simply because they were there.
In the end, however, just as in the 1980's, it was the short-term interests of NCR's institutional shareholders that decided the company's fate. Exley tried to argue that many other factors should be taken into account when a company's value was being determined -- its prospects, its products and its relationships with stakeholders. But when NCR's investors saw a stock price they liked, they took the money and ran.
A.T.&T. -- through a spokesman -- asserts that the merger with NCR will produce a strong American competitor in the global market for open systems, the most rapidly growing segment of the computing business. But NCR was already a global competitor in open systems. Its Achilles' heel was that it was a publicly owned company.
And because NCR was publicly owned, Charles Exley is now $34 million richer, thanks to his large holdings in the company. Ironically, a significant portion of these holdings consisted of incentive stock options, awarded because of his success in creating a company that became an all-but-irresistible takeover target.

HEADLINE: Delinquencies in Co-ops and Condos Are on the Rise

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
MANY co-ops and condominiums in the New York region are feeling the pinch of growing delinquencies in monthly payments from their residents, real estate experts say, a result of loss of income in the recession plus sharp rises in the cost of keeping an apartment.
"It's occurring everywhere,"said Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the New York Council of Cooperatives, which represents 130,000 dwellings in the city and suburbs. "Someone who bought at the tippy-top of the market in the 1980's may not still have their same wonderful job, or may not get the big raise and bonus they anticipated." 
 Some owners have been laid off, some have lost income because of declining business, according to co-op and condominium officials. Compounding the problem are increases in monthly maintenance fees, generally 7 to 15 percent this year at most buildings. These are due mainly to rapidly rising property taxes, labor costs and New York City water and sewer bills.
The latest round of maintenance increases comes on top of a decade of rising operating expenses. A study by Ms. Rothman's council showed that a typical co-op maintenance charge on the East Side more than doubled from 1980 to 1989, while the overall cost of living rose only 56 percent in that period.
Increasingly, co-op and condoboards are imposing stricter penalties on late payers and building managers are intervening faster when payments lag, first with informal inquiries, then with legal action that can lead to eviction and foreclosure.
To avoid costly litigation and forced sales, managers say, they encourage financially troubled residents to come forward and arrange to repay their debts. Mortgage lenders sometimes agreeto such arrangements.
A "famous" artist in a West Side penthouse "fell six months behind because his fees were slow coming in," said Paul Brensilber, executive vice president of Streamline Management, which runs buildings with 6,000 apartments. The artist is now reducing his arrears by paying extra each month.
"We have many work-outs going," said Les Gurren, president of Excelsior Management, which operates 10,000 co-op and condo apartments in the city and Westchester. In one case, he said, a corporate treasurer who was laid off took seven or eight months to find a new job and paid "at a lower rate till he could start catching up."
Not all cases have happy endings. Robert T. Cicchillo, president of Alexander Brett, which manages 2,000 apartments, said one Riverdale owner lost his job and "didn't have any money" and the apartment was too much to handle.
"They really did try everything to sell," he said, "but eventually they couldn't, so the bank foreclosed."
Co-ops and condos have always had occasional overdue accounts arising from marital or financial troubles, illness or death, but in recent months delinquencies have grown noticeably, management officials say, although there are no centralized statistics.
Anita Sapirman, president of Saparn Reality, which manages 3,000 city co-op and condo apartments, said, "Normally, payments were in by the 10th of the month. Now we've noticed some people are slowing down or not paying at all. Some became unemployed and are sending partial payments or are calling us and telling us they're in trouble."
"These are times when some people just don't have money," said Mr. Gurren of Excelsior.
Delinquencies have become cause for serious concern, board members and managers say, especially since building finances are usually premised on 100 percent collection.
"Budgets are so tight that they can't afford to have people not paying on time," said Leslie Winkler, president of Belmarc Management. The impact is more pronounced on small co-op buildings because arrears on one apartment represent a significant share of the total budget.
But with overdue payments limited to a minority of residents so far, real estate experts say the problem has not reached the point of threatening to bankrupt buildings.
Some recently converted cooperatives have been pushed to the brink of insolvency, however, by the related problem of sponsors' defaulting on maintenance for unsold apartments. Such troubled buildings also tend to suffer from delinquencies among residents, Mr. Brensilber said, because their mortgages and maintenances are relatively high.
Owners who would like to get out of their obligations by selling are likely to find themselves in a bind. With sagging property values, he said, "they would get less now than what they paid for their apartments."
To help cover their costs, some strapped apartment owners move into cheaper rentals and sublet. Although boards often bar or limit subletting, many are easing restrictions in the face of economic realities.
The region's total number of co-op and condo dwellings probably exceeds 500,000, according to Vicki Chesler, editor of the Cooperator newsletter and an adviser to the Co-op and Condo Alliance, an owner group.
Some managers of luxury buildings say they have not seen much of a problem. Marilyn Corradini, senior vice president of property management for William B. May, said applicants for expensive apartments normally have to show substantial assets to win approval and thus are less likely to default. Donald C. Goodwin, director of management for Brown, Harris, Stevens, said: "I would say it's a minimal problem at the high end of the market."
Montly payments are legally due the first of the month, but most buildings have a 10-day grace period, said Michael R. Finder, a housing lawyer in Manhattan who has seen delinquencies rising at cooperatives he represents.
A board can move to evict a nonpaying resident and sell the apartment. If there is a mortgage on the apartment, the board can also force the lender to start paying the apartment's monthly charges to the building.
"Boards are getting much more stringent about paying on time," said Mr. Gurren. "We're also doing much more early intervention, even when someone goes over just a few days, so we can nip problems early."
"Some boards used to wait 60 days before starting legal action," he said, "but those days are long gone."
A high-rise co-op complex in Brooklyn this spring notified its residents: "In recent months maintenance arrears have increased sharply. If allowed to continue unchecked, the co-op has few alternatives available to make up the shortfall." To encourage timely payments, the board doubled its late fee to $50 and imposed interest of 1.33 percent a month on arrears.
"Some people are embarrassed at letting their friends and neighbors in the co-op know they're in trouble," said Ms. Rothman of the co-op council, "but it makes much more sense to write a note to the management agent or board and say 'I lost my job' or 'my mother is ill,' or whatever the problem is."
Similarly, banks often prefer to work out a schedule for settling back payments, rather than incur the legal cost of foreclosure and risk losing money in a forced sale.
"I have found banks to be surprisingly flexible, because they really don't want to go to enforcement," said Stuart Fish, counsel to Alexander Brett management. "If the borrower acts in good faith and says 'I lost my job,' 'I'm getting a divorce' or 'I'm going into for surgery,' they may be willing to suspend payments or accept interest-only for some period."
Although hardship cases are painful, said Charles Rappaport, president of the Federation of New York Housing Cooperatives, representing 175,000 apartments in the city and suburbs, "you have a responsibility to protect the co-op and the other residents, so there are tough decisions."

 BODY:

Rent Status
 
Question: I am planning on bidding on a six-family apartment building in Brooklyn being auctioned by a bank. I need to find the status of the individual units and what the current legal rents are. Can I get this information from the city if the rents are regulated? . . . Anthony Cafaro, Brooklyn 

Answer: No. The State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which has jurisdiction over rent-regulated housing, does not have authority to release to prospective buyers information about the status of tenants and the rents they pay.
However, this information is available to the owner of the building. Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for the division, said that the bank, as owner, could authorize the agency to release the information on rents. Perhaps the best approach is to contact the bank officer responsible for the property to arrange to have the information sent to you.
 
Illegal Yard Sale
 
Question: I have a neighbor who has a yard sale practically every weekend. Sometimes he sells new merchandise. It not only causes traffic jams on the street, but presents an esthetic problem in what otherwise is a nice residential neighborhood. Is this situation legal? . . . Charleen Lang, Maspeth, Queens
 
Answer:No. The city's zoning code does not address yard sales. But Vahe Tiryakian, a spokesman for the Department of Buildings, said that his agency considers the type of sale you describe to be in violation of the prohibition against commercial enterprises in residential neighborhoods.
Some businesses are permitted in residential areas, he explained, but this certainly is not one of them.
Mr. Tiryakian said that the occasional sale of household belongings, like the yard sales or rummage drives that homeowners and tenants occasionally hold, would probably not violate the code.
"The distinction is that these types of neighborhood yard sales are infrequent," said Mr. Tiryakian, "and what is sold tends to be personal belongings that people just want to recycle. The sales are not commercial enterprises in the usual sense."
You may file a complaint against your neighbor by calling the Department of Buildings. The telephone number of the borough office in Queens is (718) 520-3402.
 
Inspection for a Co-op
 
Question: My husband and I recently rented a co-op town house in New Jersey. This unit is for sale and we are seriously thinking of purchasing it. However, we would like to know if the normal procedures for purchasing apply, like home inspection, radon test and termite inspection, since what we would be buying would be shares in a cooperative not the unit itself. . . . Kristine O'Connor, Little Falls, N.J.
 
Answer: Yes, a professional home inspection would be a good idea, said Richard R. Kahn, a Hackensack, N.J., lawyer who specializes in real estate matters.
"It may well be that the co-op corporation is responsible for many problems involving the structure, like termites," said Mr. Kahn, "but prudence would dictate that in this case rule of reason would apply. There is no point is buying into potential problems that a home inspection would reveal."
Mr. Kahn said that in addition to the inspection for termites and radon levels, a check of the air-conditioning and heating systems and other structural components would be wise.
You can probably find a professional who will perform all of these services.

HEADLINE: Legislators See Little Change in Spending Plan

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
AS the state's lawmakers resume their special session this week, they are expected to analyze Connecticut's tax system in minute detail, as they claw their way toward an answer to the historic question of whether there should be a tax on wages. But they are not expected to dwell long on the question of where that money will go -- or not go. Legislators say that the preliminary $7.7 billion spending plan hammered out in the final weeks of the regular session will probably not be changed greatly, despite what some lawmakers have criticized as heartless cuts in spending for social programs and the ambivalent and uncertain affects of the plan's package of long-term spending controls.
The reasons for the anticipated spending gridlock are bound up in both the political dynamics of the General Assembly and the simple function of the clock. The spending plan was the centerpiece of a coalition budget that passed both the House and Senate before being vetoed by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. last month, and leaders of the Republican minority have repeatedly said since then that they would immediately reject any replacement budget that does not resurrect the spending plan. 
 The majority Democrats, meanwhile, have been deeply divided over every tax idea floated so far, including an income tax. They badly need at least a few Republican votes to pass a budget in time for the start of the fiscal year on July 1. That means retaining the spending plan largely intact.
Mr. Weicker further sharpened the focus on taxes when he vetoed the legislative budget last month. The Governor, who proposed his sweeping budget overhaul and income tax plan in February, said he was rejecting the legislature's plan not because of disagreements about the spending package, but because the revenue measures were flawed. The coalition plan would have resolved the state's fiscal crisis through a huge expansion of sales and corporation taxes, a change that Mr. Weicker said would hurt the economy and be cruel to the poor. All that points to a spending package that combines open-handed generosity in some areas with deep spending cuts in others. The legislature restored about $80 million in education grants to wealthy towns that Mr. Weicker had wanted to cut, for example, but retained deep cuts in spending for the construction of low-income housing, a $78 million reduction in Medicaid reimbursement for nursing home operators and a reduction in cost-of-living adjustments for welfare recipients.
Advocates for the poor say that in some areas, the budget helps and hurts at the same time. The plan would cut $3 million from the rental-assistance program, which helps poor people pay housing costs, but would retain full spending for shelters for the homeless. Allocations for subsidized housing would be reduced to $50 million from $94 million, and direct grants to nonprofit housing developers to help defray their administration costs would be eliminated entirely.
"In trying to shortsightedly solve this immediate budget crisis this year, we are jeopardizing what we have carefully built," said Jeffrey Freiser, the executive director of the Connecticut Housing Coalition, a group that lobbys for low-cost housing.
"Our nonprofit developers are being left completely empty handed," Mr. Freiser said. "Those are small community-based operations that just can't survive that kind of funding drought."
The plan also contains a lengthy list of structural spending changes that could have far-reaching implications for future budgets. An amendment to the State Constitution limiting the growth of state spending in future years, for example, is considered almost certain to pass in the special session and be sent on to the voters for consideration, lawmakers say. The amendment would prohibit state spending from growing any faster than the rate of inflation or the growth in personal income.
What remains unanswered is what sort of spending would really be covered by a spending cap. State grants to municipalities and spending for the Medicaid program, two of the largest single items in the budget, are both driven by formulas or definitions of eligibility. If a cap on spending growth conflicts with those other regulations, which one holds sway?
Another long-term change would take the Department of Motor Vehicles off the state's general-fund budget entirely and place it instead in the separate transportation fund. The shift would save an estimated $51 million next year in general fund revenues, but critics say they fear a drain on the transportation fund's resources.
Among its functions, the fund sells state bonds to pay for things like highway repair, then collects gasoline taxes and license fees to pay the interest and principal. Its bond rating is crucial in determining the cost of state borrowing.
 
Depends on Who's Looking
 "It's an issue of financial soundness, of budgetary soundness," said Representative William R. Dyson, a Democrat from New Haven and co-chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Mr. Dyson said he questioned the wisdom of transferring the Department of Motor Vehicles, but he conceded that all such spending issues will take a back seat to taxes in the days to come.
"Is the issue regarding transportation fund solvency in 1998, or 1997, or 1996 of any importance?" Mr. Dyson asked. The answer, he said, is that it depends on who's looking. "For the bondholders, it is," he said. "For us here, it might not be as important."
But the spending and taxing sides of the budget are also bound to intersect during the special session, and several flash points have been identified that could spark changes on one side of the budget or the other. The proposal to reduce cost-of-living adjustments for welfare recipients, for example, was initially suggested by Mr. Weicker in his budget.
The proposal was part of the Governor's overall budget plan, which called, among other changes, for a lowering of the 8 percent sales tax -- the highest statewide rate in the nation -- to 4.25 percent. Because the sales tax was being cut so dramatically, the Governor's budget officials argued, slowing the growth in welfare benefits was not as draconian as it seemed.
The legislature's coalition spending plan also included the cost-of-living reduction, but in that plan, the sales tax was kept at 8 percent and expanded to a wide new realm of transactions. Weicker administration officials argued that the expansion of the sales tax would make the welfare reduction cruel and unfair.
 
Erosion of Sales Tax
 The circle was completed on the last day of the regular legislative session on Wednesday, when the Senate called up Mr. Weicker's budget for what leaders said was a symbolic vote of no confidence. They said they wanted to convey, in part, that the Governor's budget plan had become obsolete in the four months since his initial proposal.
They said that the continuing erosion of sales tax collections, in particular, had widened the revenue gap that the budget will have to make up. That has made a 4.25 percent sales tax impossible, the Senators said. Even if all else were kept intact in Mr. Weicker's proposal -- including the 6 percent wage tax on income over $25,000 for a couple filing jointly and $12,500 for an individual -- the sales tax would have to be at least 5.25 percent, they said.
The Senate defeated the Weicker plan by a vote of 28 to 8, then adjourned several hours later.
In his closing comments, Mr. Weicker said: "Why there is no budget is irrelevant as of this moment. When is the only question of importance."

HEADLINE: New Courthouse

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The article on the new Federal office building and courthouse to be built downtown ["A Spur to Slow Construction," April 28] unfortunately missed some points. 
 First, the project was an initiative of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. To his credit, he aimed for quality architecture. Unfortunately, he also pushed for the friendly condemnation.
The new courthouse, for which there is a greater need than the office building, should be given the Broadway site. The Chinatown community's only park will be darkened by the new courthouse in its designated location behind the New York County Courthouse, which will require relocation of many utility lines.
The environmental-impact statements for the buildings noted serious concern about the sites' geological and hydrological problems. The danger posed to the integrity of 22 Reade Street, where the City Planning Commission has its headquarters, by the construction of the new 290 Broadway building on the same block is set forth in the reports.
Nineteenth-century cast-iron buildings have collapsed during construction and 22 Reade Street itself caved in during renovation. It remains without a certificate of occupancy.
The General Services Administration would have liked to acquire the full Broadway lot but the city's Department of General Services felt it had done a wonderful job with 22 Reade Street. The staff at the Department of City Planning feels otherwise.
The rear windows of 22 Reade -- assuming the building doesn't collapse, sink or slide into the construction pit during construction -- will face an air well.
The city should have ceded the entire block to the Federal Government and relocated the Department of City Planning.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dinner;
Where Casual Finally Meets Reasonable

 BODY:
If there are two words that characterize the New York City dining scene these days, they are casual and reasonable. After the showy excess of the 1980's, diners yearn to loosen their ties, lean back and relax, and economy is a major concern. The restaurant industry has been quick to heed the call with many establishments that combine both qualities. Here are three of them.
 
Claire
 156 Seventh Avenue, near 20th Street, (212) 255-1955 -- Modeled after a restaurant by the same name in Key West, Fla., this pleasing seafood house in Chelsea is a big, aqua-toned place with bare wood floors, paper-covered tables, skylights, wood latticework room dividers and palms. Appetizers on the Sunday menu include blackened tuna sashimi with a wasabi-soy sauce; roasted portobello mushrooms with pesto vinaigrette; Bahamian conch chowder; and roasted andouille with creole mustard sauce. Among entrees are sauteed softshell crab with tartar sauce; Bayou crayfish patties with cayenne-cilantro sauce; broiled Key West grouper Provencal; Norwegian salmon with a cucumber-dill sauce; and roast duckling with a sauce of fresh plums and hot peppers. For desserts, Key lime pie and mango crumb pie. Appetizers range from $3.95 to $8.95; main courses, $14.95 to $16.95; desserts, $3.50 to $4.95. Sunday dinner is from 5:30 P.M. to midnight. (Review, Sept. 23, 1988.) 

Rose Cafe
24 Fifth Avenue at Ninth Street, (212) 260-4118 -- Richard Krause, the chef and owner of this upbeat American restaurant comes from the California school of cooking and serves fine food at very reasonable prices. Three dining areas are done in soft eggshell-toned walls and simple cylinder-shaped sconces. A glass-enclosed sidewalk terrace affords an animated urban panorama. For starters on Sunday, there are crisp potato pancakes with creme fraiche and caviar; pork and shrimp dumplings with Cantonese lobster sauce and hot mustard; a salad of couscous, sweet peppers, eggplant, zucchini, red onions and mache; and pizza topped with sun-dried tomatoes, yellow tomatoes, homemade mozzarella and fresh basil.
Main courses include rare charred tuna with a mango-tomato-red onion vinaigrette; grilled summer vegetables with wild rice and five-bean salad; roast breast of duck with cassis and poached pears; and soft-shell crab served with a Chinese black bean sauce, steamed mussels and crisp spinach. Among the desserts are toasted angel food cake with coffee ice cream and chocolate sauce, and assorted fresh fruit gratin with a Champagne sabayon. Appetizers range from $4.25 to $7.50; entrees, $12.95 to $16.95; desserts, $4.50 to $6. Sunday dinner is from 5:30 P.M. to midnight; Rose Cafe also serves a brunch from 11:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. (Review, May 25, 1990.)

 
Phoenix Garden
 46 Bowery, inside the arcade just north of Elizabeth Street, (212) 233-6017 or (212) 962-8934 -- This is neither the most affable nor the most comfortable spot in Chinatown, but some of the best Cantonese fare in New York City can be had here. Among recommended starters are mustard greens and sliced pork soup with ginger; pepper and salty shrimp; stewed eggplant with ground ham casserole; and crispy roasted squab. Fine main courses include sea scallops in hot black pepper sauce; braised duck with mustard greens; stewed beef flank with sweet turnips, mustard greens, garlic and coriander; and lobster with satee sauce, a piquant blend of black pepper and curry, served over noodles. Appetizers range from $3.25 to $8.95; main courses, $5 to $25.50. Sunday hours are from 11:30 A.M. to 10:30 P.M. No credit cards are accepted. (Review, May 10, 1991.)

HEADLINE: A Party Fleet Tries Not to Founder

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS

 BODY:
Chris Coronesi stood at the stern rail of the Pastime II amid a half-dozen cronies fishing for flounder three miles off the Rockaway jetty near the Brooklyn-Queens border. He had one hand on a fishing rod and the other on a cellular telephone with an extension cord that snaked into a portable battery pack as his feet. Mr. Coronesi, the president of Aspen Associates, a Manhattan construction management and contracting company, was talking to a client.
"Hold it a minute," he said into the phone after feeling a tug on his rod. "I've got some business on the other line." 
 Mr. Coronesi's friends howled with laughter, and Mr. Coronesi displayed the self-satisfied smirk that bespeaks the man who has beaten the system. But the scene was possible only because of the recession.
"There's no construction business in New York right now, so why should I sit in my office being depressed when I can come out here on George's boat and enjoy myself?" he said.
 
The Skipper Hates Fish
 Mr. Coronesi and most of the 25 fishermen aboard the 65-foot fishing boat are regular customers of Capt. George Richford. Mr. Richford, the 50-year-old owner and skipper of the Pastime II, has been operating out of Sheepshead Bay for 35 years. A grizzled salt who can't stand the taste of fish, he runs the boat with his son, Phil Richford, 25, and two crewmen.
The very names of the craft in Sheepshead Bay -- Amberjack V, Sea Wolf, Ranger, Helen II, Sunshine, Romance, Grace -- are meant to entice the kind of people who regard fishing as more entertaining than watching television or playing cards.
But the recession that sent Mr. Coronesi out fishing has, at the same time, helped to cut into the number of party boats based in Sheepshead Bay. Where there were 33 party boats three years ago, there are now 18. And Mr. Richford's boat, which is licensed to carry 70 people, was on this day carrying only 25.
Mr. Richford is well aware that, for Sheepshead Bay, an evolution is under way. While the party-boat business is going downhill, condominium developers -- hoping to cash in on the long and colorful history of the area -- are putting up apartments hardly a clamshell's throw away from Pier 3, where the Pastime II docks.
 
Birthplace of Surf and Turf
 Sheepshead Bay hit its prime a century ago, when Lillie Langtry, Lillian Russell and their entourages would traipse out to the Brooklyn waterfront. Those were the days before air-conditioning and food refrigeration, when cooling onshore breezes were a luxury and so was fresh seafood.
Diamond Jim Brady coined the term "surf and turf" for the gargantuan lobster-and-steak dinner he favored at the 2,800-seat Lundy Brothers restaurant on Emmons Avenue. But Lundy's, a New York landmark that anchored the Sheepshead Bay community for decades, closed more than a dozen years ago. Mr. Richford and the remaining party-boat operators have fought a long and losing battle to have the city help the fishermen and restaurateurs by, for example, providing off-street parking for customers. The boat owners seem to have little political influence, and most of their customers are now on the far side of 60.
Perhaps 15 of the 25 fishermen aboard the Pastime II that morning were retirees, paying a discounted rate of $13 for a half-day of fishing. (The full fare is $16; children can fish for $9.) But not all those on Mr. Richford's boat were retired.
Ruthie Ashkenazi, 17, who had just graduated from high school in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, was on her first fishing trip. She was with her boyfriend, Kevin Rosenfeld, 16, of the Borough Park section, a clerk in a camera store.
 
It Might Be the High Seas
 "Kevin phoned me at 3 A.M. and said we were going fishing," she said. Kevin had started going out on party boats a couple of months ago. "I caught 42 mackerel the first time I went," he said, "and now I fish at least once a week."
Looking out over the water, which was occasionally blanketed by fog, he added: "I like to think that I'm fishing in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. I'm not, of course, but it makes me feel good."
He might well have been speaking for the others, because eventually it became clear that for many of them, going fishing was more important than catching a monster fish. Indeed, only three fish of any size were hauled in that morning.
Charlie Schuster, 79, of Glendale, Queens, caught one of them. Mr. Schuster, who used to run a textiles mill in Brooklyn, goes out on the Pastime II several times a week. "Thank God for Social Security," he said shortly before he hooked the three-pound flounder that won him the "largest fish" pool of $38.

COMPANIES
 
Where's That Time Warner Synergy? 

To the poor Time Warner Inc. shareholder, it must seem like arm-twisting time. Just before the merger last year they were treated to tales of synergy. Just after the merger, reality -- in the form of $11 billion in debt -- appeared like a skunk at a garden party. To bring down that debt, rumor had it Time Warner would sell off a minority interest. No such luck. Last week the company released its debt-reduction plan. It will try to raise about $3 billion through an offering of 34.5 million new shares for a price between $63 and $105, depending on how many shares are sold. But the plan requires investors to buy new shares to maintain their percentage ownership. An investor with 100 shares might have to kick in more than $5,000. "It's an unbelievable deal for shareholders, if someone does the math," said Steven J. Ross, the company's chairman. Maybe so, but Time Warner stock fell $11.25 to $99.50 on the news and closed the week at $94.675.

Baby Bells' Chance to Grow
 
When the courts created the seven regional phone companies from the old Bell system in 1984, there was a lot the "Baby Bells" were not permitted to do. Manufacturing their own equipment, for instance, was taboo. So was offering long-distance service. But last week the Senate voted 71 to 24 to allow the Baby Bells to make their own equipment -- although only if they do it domestically with minimal foreign content. The Senate figures letting the Baby Bells manufacture here will help trim the $792 million trade deficit in telecommunications equipment. The Senate also thinks that with $77 billion in revenues, the Baby Bells have the cash to become master manufacturers -- even exporters of their handiwork. But opponents of the measure fear the Baby Bells will have to raise phone rates to subsidize their entry into manufacturing. The measure now has to clear the House, where it faces a tough battle.
 
One More Ailing Airline
 
Another airline is in trouble. But this time the winds are favorable. Last week America West Airlines Inc. suspended payments to holders of leases on its planes to conserve cash. A drastic step. The airline -- the nation's ninth largest -- lost $49.9 million in the first quarter and $2.6 million the previous quarter. But for the first time since the Persian Gulf crisis, traffic was up sharply across the industry and fuel prices were down. That, analysts say, could keep the airline out of Chapter 11.
 
Bidding for the General
 
Before Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf became a media star, all he had to contend with were Saddam Hussein and the Republican Guards. Now agents, editors and publishers have been added to the list. Five publishers -- Bantam, HarperCollins, Alfred A. Knopf, William Morrow and Random House -- are all bidding for General Schwarzkopf's life story. The bids range from $2.5 million to $5 million (the rights they want to buy differ). But the general had better move with dispatch. With so many articles about him -- and with other concerns pushing the war into the background -- "he is in danger of being overexposed," said Jib Fowles, a professor of communications at the University of Houston.
 
The Truth About Fat
 
Food labeling has always been a battleground between the sizzle and the steak. Packagers want products to seem good for you even if they are not. They see labels as a chance to advertise. Health advocates want packages that tell the whole truth -- which requires space. Last week the Federal Drug Administration said it was clamping down on false claims about fat, its second crackdown in little more than a month. "A product that says it is 97 percent fat free but has 50 percent of its calories from fat is misleading," said David A. Kessler, head of the F.D.A. In April the F.D.A. restricted use of the word "fresh." "We have got to get false and misleading statements off the label," Dr. Kessler said.
 
Advertising's Letdown
 
The advertising industry has already suffered two years of sluggish growth. Last week it learned it will have to suffer a third. Robert J. Coen, senior vice president at McCann-Ericson U.S.A., lowered his estimates for how much American companies will spend on advertising this year. Revenue will grow just 3.1 percent, not 4.6 percent as he had originally hoped. Mr. Coen, who has been forecasting the ad business since 1948, said revenues will be $128.6 billion this year. But 1992 will be rosier, he said. He sees revenues growing by 8.5 percent -- to $144 billion -- due to the Olympics and the Presidential elections, events sure to glue consumers to newspapers, radio and the tube. After that, it's anybody's guess.
 
Chrysler in the 'Junk' Heap
 
Detroit's woes show no sign of abating. Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks dropped 10 percent in May from a year earlier. Chrysler's sales fell the most, down 23 percent. Just after the figures were released Standard & Poors downgraded Chrysler's bonds to "BB-" -- which makes them "junk." "With the exception of April and January, last month was still one of the lowest sales months in memory," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist for Manufactures Hanover Trust in New York. "We may have hit bottom, but we're a long way from recovery."
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Credit Markets Act Up
 
The economy is bottoming out, said Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, at a news conference in Japan. But that piece of good news sent the credit markets into conniptions. The price of Treasury bonds fell sharply, driving up interest rates by almost 50 basis points. Quite a hefty jump for a single day. Why all the fuss? "The markets see an upward trajectory and they think inflation," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago. But this time the markets may be getting it wrong. Recessions are typically followed by periods of perky growth between 5 and 6 percent. That's inflationary. But this is not a typical recession. It is shorter and shallower than most and the recovery is likely to be weaker. "Growth will only be about 1.8 percent over the next three quarters. That's non-inflationary," said Mr. Kahan. Even so, the markets are acting scared.
 
A Recovery Without Muscle
 
More evidence that the economy's soft landing into a recession will be followed by a 98-pound weakling of a recovery: Unemployment increased by three-tenths of a percent to 6.9 percent in April, according to the Labor Department. Increased unemployment often precedes a recovery since companies want to make sure their order books are full before they start hiring again. Still, the numbers show that while certain sectors of the economy are beginning to hum the growth tune, it will take time before the ranks of the unemployed are thinned.
 
Setting a Date for Recovery
 
Picking the date when the economy noses its way back into growth is a tricky business. But last week an important indicator, the National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly index, showed growth may be near. The index, based on a survey of the buying plans of the nation's top purchasing managers, edged its way up to 45.4 percent in May from 42.1 percent in April, the first increase in seven months. "This is another confirmation that the bottoming-out process is ending and signs of a recovery are beginning to emerge," said Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
 
A Reconstructed Industry
 
The building industry has been languishing at activity levels not seen since 1982. That is finally beginning to change. Spending on construction projects jumped by 0.8 percent in April, the Commerce Department said last week. That is the largest gain in 14 months.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

Hesitant Help for the Soviets
 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's speech last week in Oslo was a real spellbinder, they said. He spoke about perestroika and how the West needs to help it succeed as he slipped into town to pick up his Nobel Peace Prize. But his words did not play in Paris where finance ministers of the world's 24 richest nations were meeting. This hard-nosed group needs to see an economic reform plan that has a chance of turning the Soviet Union around. So far it has not. "Until they see a plan," said Benjamin Weiner of Probe International, a consulting firm in Stamford, Conn., "the only credits Gorbachev will get will be the ones that benefit the lending country most."
 
A Target, Translated
 
"Target" must mean different things in English and Japanese. In 1986, American and Japanese trade negotiators set 20 percent as a target for how much of the Japanese computer-chip market American companies would get. American chip makers never came close. The Reagan Administration retaliated with a 100 percent duty on some exports. Even that did not work. Last week the Bush Administration negotiated another chip pact. The target was the same, but critics were concerned that it has no timetable. "The Japanese only move on these things when someone pushes them," said Laura D. Tyson, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley.
 
Same Old Arms Sales
 
To a cynic listening to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney last week, the new world order might have sounded surprisingly like the old one. Mr. Cheney, returning from a 10-day trip to Europe and the Middle East, announced arm sales worth $2.1 billion. Twenty Apache Helicopters, made by by McDonnell Douglas Inc., would go to the United Arab Emirates. The Administration was also considering selling them 337 of General Dynamics' M1-A1 tanks. The new world order seems to favor exports.

HEADLINE: Tarnish on the Golden Arch?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a 16-year -- now former -- McDonald's franchisee I can readily attest to the veracity of "An American Icon Wrestles with a Troubled Future" (May 12). 
 The prime cause of McDonald's problems is corporate and executive arrogance. This attitude permeates the entire structure. It has resulted in a reactive and defensive management style instead of a pro-active and progressive one that sees future social changes and is prepared to capitalize on them as they materialize.
In the late 1970's, at a convention in Orlando, Fla., I publicly advocated to a McDonald's executive the need for salads as an alternative to our sandwich menu, which consisted of red meat and fried food. His answer: "Salads are for flower children." Salads were finally introduced in 1987. The McLean Deluxe was only very recently introduced and the excellent grilled chicken breast sandwich is still being tested.
Environmentally, because of its ubiquity, McDonald's is erroneously thought to be a major polluter. It isn't. But management should have understood this fact and taken action late in the 70's by implementing a program that would resolve this problem. The current customer-oriented program accomplishes little environmentally and much less in public relations than was desired.
Reducing prices does not help the economically impacted franchisee. Without significant reductions in site and building costs, this action only reduces profits and creates dissatisfaction in the operator community.
The long waiting list of franchise hopefuls is mostly made up of people who are looking at the past profits made by existing franchisees and who don't understand the enormous amount of hard work it takes to achieve an ever-decreasing bottom line.
McDonald's is one of the finest organizations in the world. Will management have the wisdom and clairvoyance to adopt a pro-active style to solve its current and future problems?

HEADLINE: A Cavil or Two on Raising Oil Prices

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I offer your reader David Marder (Letters, May 26) several cavils on raising oil prices: 
 It is not in the national interest to promote petroleum use in either agriculture or petrochemical manufacturing.
Long before benefits from any general "petrotax" increase can be felt great hardship will have been imposed on lower-income Americans.
Bursts of inflation have been associated with increases in oil price throughout modern times.

New Highs for South African Stocks

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Inflation in South Africa is around 14 percent. Last year the economy declined about 1 percent, and this year the forecast is for little or no growth. Gold prices are weak, which is no help for the world's leading gold producer. And the violence between the followers of the African National Congress and the Zulu-dominated Inkatha Freedom Party has complicated the negotiations over movement toward a new Government.
But despite these factors, the South African stock market, the 10th largest in the world, has managed to climb this year. In fact, the market's industrial index, which includes manufacturers, retailers and consumer goods companies, has consistently hit record highs in the last several months. On Friday, it closed at 3,682, another new high, which is up 22 percent for the year. The overall local index, which includes gold stocks, is up 18 percent since the end of 1990. 
 Despite the psychological boost that the market has had from the rally in the stock markets in the United States and elsewhere, much of the explanation is in South Africa's special circumstances.
Chief among these is the "hothouse" effect of South Africa's economy. To stop capital outflow, South African mutual and pension funds and individuals cannot legally invest overseas, and exchange controls make it prohibitively expensive for companies to do so. This means the cash stays home, and, simply put, there are a lot of rands in South Africa chasing a small number of stocks.
According to John Taylor of James Capel Inc. in London, the Government may soon raise limits on the portion of mutual funds that may be invested in stocks to 75 percent. The limit is 65 percent now.
In addition, consumer spending is thriving, especially among blacks, despite the recession. "It has been a funny sort of recession here," said Niall Brown of Simpson McKie, a brokerage house in Johannesburg. "It has been a fixed-investment and a capital-goods recession but not a consumer recession." This phenomenon is also reflected in the decline in the country's savings rate.
"As strange as it may seem to the outsider, there has been a redistribution of wealth," added Emmanuel Pohl, director of the research department at the firm of Davis Borkum Hare, referring to the growth of the underground economy. "And that spending power has been driving this sector."
The stock in Edgar's, the dominant retailer of clothing, footwear, textiles and accessories, is up 42.5 percent this year. South African Breweries has risen 30.4 percent.
There are some signs that this rally may hold, although it could face some corrections. Gold stocks have rallied now that the price of gold, which was up again on Friday, seems to have bottomed out. Economic projections for next year show the economy beginning to recover and earnings, especially in the industrial sector, rising to about 18 percent, according to Mr. Taylor.
At the same time, negotiations toward a new Government, while difficult, are moving ahead. And President F. W. de Klerk has pledged to dismantle the last of the apartheid laws this year. The United States could lift its economic sanctions soon because the South African Government is close to meeting the preconditons. The European Community has already removed its toughest sanctions. Still, many analysts argue that in the beginning this will have an impact that is more psychological than financial.
But the outlook is also still very risky, in part because of the concern over economic development, which will require a return of capital and investment from abroad and help from international financial agencies, like the International Monetary Fund.
Mr. Taylor of James Capel said, "The social situation remains extremely fragile, and unless the issues of housing, education and law and order are urgently addressed, unrest could threaten to dislocate the promising advances made in the political-economic arena."
 The governor of South Africa's central bank, Chris Stals, said recently that the country could be ungovernable by 1995 if economic and social problems are not dealt with. "We must not overlook the influence of the low growth rate on the prevailing violence," he said.

Dollar Still Gains On Mark, Franc

 BODY:
The dollar rose sharply on Friday, bringing it to a new level in its four-month rally, in which it has risen 22 percent against the mark. The dollar passed 140 yen and 1.77 marks, key levels in its march back from post-World War II lows against the mark and levels not far above the record low against the yen.
The stimulus on Friday was the surprising employment report. Rather than showing a decline in nonfarm payroll jobs -- which had been the consensus expectation -- the Labor Department said nonfarm jobs increased by 59,000. This means the recession may be ending and there is little chance the Fed will lower interest rates further. The Japanese are also less likely to lower their interest rates.

HEADLINE: Who in the End Pays for Free Trade? The American Worker

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Who Champions the Working Class?" (Op-Ed, May 26), Robert B. Reich presents the stunning statistic that two-thirds of American wage earners have lost 12 percent in real wages (hence in purchasing power) in the last 15 years -- and then proceeds to deplore protectionism. But global free trade is the very phenomenon that produced that statistic. No other explanation is convincing. 
 Corporations always pay workers as little as they can. But labor unions forced wages up to higher levels. No more. Stiff international economic competition, often the direct product of free trade involving cheap foreign labor using first-rate machines, has gravely weakened unions and forced them to forgo wage gains to promote job security. And when union wage levels stagnate or fall, wages in the nonunionized service industries suffer also. That is the pattern. The upshot: two-thirds of American wage earners are mired in comparatively low wages -- or in increasing unemployment. They are the clear victims of free trade in the modern world.
Free trade provides more jobs for desperatedly poor foreign workers. If we believe that the welfare of everyone everywhere matters, that should be a source of satisfaction.
But while free trade is also a bonanza for consumers, improves industrial efficiency and is good for many skilled workers and professional employees, it is bad for tens of millions of American workers. And while the slippage in American wage levels hasn't caused this recession, it will prolong it and weaken the eventual recovery. The lack of enough worker purchasing power to fuel a vigorous economy is an ominous development with long-range consequences that proponents of free trade don't like to confront or even acknowledge.
We are told that the answer to this problem is to upgrade American education and hence United States technical and creative skills. But that is a long, arduous and uncertain project. Given the negative factors at work, no one knows how it will turn out. So Professor Reich provides a glib answer, but not a reassuring one.
American workers are paying and will continue to pay a very high price for this nation's commitment to free trade.

HEADLINE: British Health Service, Much Beloved But Inadequate, Is Facing Changes

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, June 8

 BODY:
Ever since the inception of the National Health Service just after World War II, Conservative Party politicians have found that meddling too much with a system that provides health care for all Britons was political suicide.
Prime Minister John Major's Government says it is trying to put the system on a more businesslike basis and improve its services to customers, and it is paying for it this year. 
 Underfinanced, inefficient and universally beloved, the "National Health" will consume about $56 billion of taxpayers' money in 1991, almost three times what it took a decade ago, but about the same percentage of British gross domestic product -- a little less than 6 percent.
Yet it cannot satisfy many of the country's needs.
 
700,000 Wait for Surgery
 More than 700,000 people are on waiting lists for operations, the Government acknowledges, and about 200,000 of them have been waiting for more than a year. Nearly half them are waiting for one of these common operations: hernia repair, varicose veins, hip replacements, examinations of joints, tonsils and adenoids, sterilizations and cataract removals, the Department of Health says.
But because hospitals do not have enough beds, or lack money to pay enough surgeons to perform all these operations, the waiting lists grow.
The Government increased spending on health this year by $5.25 billion, but besides more money, it thought more competition for customers among hospitals and doctors might help.
Under a law that was passed last year, the Government began last month to allow some hospitals and group general practitioners with at least 9,000 patients to administer their own budgets and enter into service contracts with one another, instead of being told what to do by the Health Service bureaucracy.
Soon after the plan went into effect in April, Guy's Hospital, one of the best known and respected London teaching hospitals in the system, announced that it would eliminate 600 of its 3,000 staff jobs, mainly by attrition, over the next year. Its sister hospital, Lewisham, would lose 300 more. Guy's later reduced the number of jobs to be lost to 295.
The chief executive of the Guy's-Lewisham trust, Peter Griffiths, told the staff that the first year would be difficult, because they needed to clear debts of $11.9 million from previous years. "There is no point in trying to support a service that is not the best for patients, simply because it has always been provided," he added.
Because it was one of the flagships of the Government's new program, the hospital instantly became the center of a political storm. In the tumult, few asked whether Guy's might be doing some things best left to others, or whether it was overstaffed, as critics say the whole health service is.
Instead, the debate centered on whether the Government's plans would lead to a deterioration in the quality of care for all patients, or give preferential treatment to those whose doctors went along with the new plan.
"It's very difficult to see how losing 10 percent staff over a year is going to improve the quality of care," said Prof. Harry Keen, an opponent of the Government's plans who formally retired from Guy's last year but continues to maintain an office in the 266-year-old hospital.
All this was happening, furthermore, as Mr. Major was coming under pressure to decide when to call the national election that must be held by July of next year. The opposition Labor Party also sounded alarms nationwide about what would happen to the 56 British hospitals that have been given self-governing status, with 120 more expected to get it next year.
A special parliamentary election to fill a vacancy in the Conservative-held Monmouth constituency in Wales became a referendum on the Health Service changes, and the Labor Party won comfortably. Opinion polls showed that the Health Service was far and away the voters' biggest concern.
In an interview on the grounds of Guy's the other day, Professor Keen said, "The doctor's job is not to make money, but to spend money wisely and well."
Ian McColl, head of the department of surgery at Guy's, said that was precisely what the staff reduction would do. "This will release money that can be used to treat more patients," said Lord McColl, who supported the Government's plans for changes and was given a life peerage in 1989.
 
Many Are Alarmed
 Instead of reassuring people, the changes have scared many into thinking that the Government's real object was to dismantle the Health Service, privatize it, and leave them to pay their hospital bills through health insurance they can buy on their own.
Some free-market economists wish the Government had done just that when it passed the new law.
"The structural flaw in the Government's proposals was that they didn't take into account the true nature of health care, which is that it's partly discretionary," said David G. Green, head of the health unit at the Institute of Economic Affairs, which tried and failed to convert Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to its position in 1988.
"Except for emergency cases," he said, "whether people choose to have many different kinds of operations depends partly on income, partly on fashion, personal belief or skepticism in medical science, pain threshholds and so on."
 
Monopoly Criticized
 In his view, as long as the Health Service remains a virtual monopoly, economic inefficiencies like waiting lists for operations will be inevitable. Only an estimated 6.8 million of Britain's 57.5 million people carry private health insurance, and private hospitals have 78,500 beds, compared with the Health Service's 282,900.
"It's still a rationing system, with producer domination and consumer weakness," he said of the Health Service.
And despite the system, many Britons do end up with worries about paying for health care. A retired British journalist on a small pension, for instance, wrote to his American employer at the end of last year saying he needed a triple bypass heart operation and a heart valve replacement. "The National Health Service said April was the earliest it could take me," he wrote. "So the alternative seemed death or a private hospital immediately."
He went to a private hospital and had the operations last fall, at a cost of $26,250 from his own pocket.
"He shouldn't have done that," Lord McColl said, when told about the case. "He should have gone back to his National Health Service hospital and told them that another hospital could get him in earlier, and they probably would have let him jump the queue."
 
Preferential Treatment Charged
 Some Health Service doctors have charged that large general practitioners with their own budgets were being promised such preferential treatment, in exchange for bringing in patients, and income, to some of the new self-managing hospital trusts. But the hospitals and Mr. Major deny this.
"There is no question of a two-tier health service," he told the House of Commons the day of the voting in Monmouth.
The Labor Party leader, Neil Kinnock, said that if his party won the next election, it would spend $35 billion more on public services, including health, over the following four to five years.
Labor also says that as a percentage of gross domestic product, the United Kingdom spends less on health -- 6.1 percent, most of it on the National Health Service -- than most other European Community countries. The United States spent 11.2 percent in 1987, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris.

HEADLINE: De Klerk Visits Kenya's Chief, Urging Normal Ties

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, June 8

 BODY:
South Africa's long closed door to the rest of Africa swung open wider today when President F. W. de Klerk flew to Kenya for a brief but significant visit with President Daniel arap Moi.
Kenya became the 10th African country to receive Mr. de Klerk in the two years since he replaced P. W. Botha as National Party leader and then President and promised to dismantle apartheid. 
 His domestic revisions have led to a growing acceptance of South Africa among black African countries that were offended by its racist ideology. South Africa's isolation was also eroded by its disengagement from the war in Angola and the granting of independence to Namibia, which was administered by Pretoria for 76 years.
At a news conference after his arrival in Nairobi, President de Klerk expressed the hope that South Africa would be admitted sooner rather than later into the Organization of African Unity, which held a summit meeting in Nigeria this week.
"We are part of Africa and I think most African countries would welcome us into the O.A.U.," Mr. de Klerk said, according to the South African Press Association.
South African officials see President de Klerk's visit to Kenya, which dominates East Africa, as a breakthrough because it is one of three African countries that, through their regional stature, could influence a normalization of relations across the continent.
The other two countries are Egypt in northern Africa and Nigeria in West Africa. Mr. de Klerk met with President Hosni Mubarek of Egypt during Namibia's independence celebrations in March 1990. On Tuesday, President Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria told reporters that he was not opposed to meeting Mr. de Klerk if it would help bring equal voting rights for South Africa's black majority.
At a meeting this week in Abuja, Nigeria, the Organization of African Unity agreed to reconsider economic sanctions against Pretoria "with a view toward readmitting South Africa into the international community" once it adopted "measures which lead to positive, profound and irreversible change."
Some South African officials say they hope that will happen after Parliament scraps the last apartheid legislation this month.
President arap Moi of Kenya was among the leaders at the African summit meeting who argued for a more flexible approach to South Africa as a result of its transition toward non-racial democracy.
The dropping of sanctions by the 51nation organization would constitute a prestigous acknowledgement of political change in South Africa that could encourage the United States and other European countries to follow suit. It would also open new markets in Africa for South African exports, which cost less than goods imported from Europe.
A report released at the O.A.U. meeting estimated that South Africa's commerce with the rest of the continent had reached $4 billion a year. South African officials say their country is already trading with every other African country but one. One official said he believed the exception was Libya. According to another official, two tiny African countries, Equatorial Guinea and Djibouti, failed to trade with South Africa last year.
Since August 1989, Mr. de Klerk has visited Mozambique, Zaire, Zambia, Ivory Coast, Namibia, Cape Verde, Madagascar, Morocco and Senegal. He is scheduled to visit Swaziland on Monday.
President de Klerk's trip to Kenya today has been described in the South African press as the biggest top-level visit undertaken to another African country since 1948, when the National Party came to power and proceeded to introduce apartheid.
President de Klerk, who was met on his arrival in Nairobi by President arap Moi, was accompanied by Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha and three other Cabinet ministers responsible for trade and tourism, energy and agriculture.
The visit has more modest goals of establishing President de Klerk's credibility and defining areas for bilateral cooperation.

HEADLINE: New York City Pursues Early-Retirement Plan for Principals

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
New York City school officials are holding delicate negotiations on a plan to entice as many as one in five principals to retire within a year. The plan is intended to save on salaries and open slots for more black and Hispanic administrators.
Even proponents of the early-retirement plan, which would provide generous pension incentives, worry that it could churn up more turmoil in a system already bracing for hundreds of teacher layoffs and steep cuts in maintenance and supplies. 
 Replacing a principal is a drawn-out and intensely political process, often pitting parents and community school boards against each other. Once an appointment is finalized, it may take months for everyone to grow comfortable with the change.
But the plan's champions also see in the ripples of this upheaval an opportunity to allow more black and Hispanic assistant principals to become principals and more minority teachers to become assistant principals.
 
Worried About an Exodus
 In a system where more than 80 percent of the students are black, Hispanic or Asian, almost 70 percent of the principals and 75.8 percent of the assistant principals are white. That disparity is partly because administrators are drawn from the overwhelmingly white ranks of teachers and partly because there is a disproportionately low number of black and Hispanic candidates who have taken the required graduate courses and job tests.
Facing budget cuts of $505 million, the seven-member board began discussing early-retirement incentives for principals because such opportunities are already being offered to senior teachers to reduce salary costs and protect younger teachers from layoffs. Michael J. Petrides, the Staten Island representative to the Board of Education, said members were concerned about the patent unfairness of offering pension bonuses only to teachers.
Still, board members and Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez were worried that an unlimited retirement offer would lead to an exodus of experienced school leaders. They talked about capping the number of those who would be allowed to leave at 15 percent for principals and 10 percent for assistant principals.
But Mr. Petrides and Donald Singer, the president of the Council of Supervisors and Adminstrators, which represents the principals, proposed a "controlled attrition" plan that would allow everyone who wished to retire to do so, but in stages that might minimize disruption. One group of principals would leave in September, another in February and another in September 1992.
 
200 Might Retire
 Mr. Singer said he believes as many as 200 of the 330 eligible principals would take advantage of the pension incentives, or one-fifth of the city's 988 principals. Other officials in his union estimated the number at closer to 130. Usually, 50 principals retire in a year, union officials said.
"The Chancellor hasn't said yes or no," Mr. Singer said. "He sees a lot of merit in the plan. He wants to see the fiscal implications."
Mr. Petrides said Mr. Fernandez, who would make the ultimate decision on the plan, liked it. But city officials, he said, worry that it would inflate the pensions of people who were planning to leave anyway.
The pension incentive would give professionals who are older than 55 or have 30 years of experience three extra years of work credit in computing their pensions. Principals earn from $61,452 to $74,139, and their pensions can reach 80 percent of their final year's salary.
 
'Can You Justify It at All?'
 The plan is already drawing fire from some of the city's public interest groups. Jeanne Frankl, executive director of the Public Education Association, an educational advocacy group, said that the plan's savings would be small, because the difference between starting and senior principals' salaries is not as great as that between a starting and senior teacher's.
"Since you cannot justify it on economic grounds, the question is, can you justify it at all?" she asked. "The real problem is that who goes and who stays is not decided on the basis of the system's needs."
James S. Vlasto, a spokesman for Mr. Fernandez, would confirm only that discussions were taking place with the principals' union, and said Mr. Fernandez has not stated what kind of plan he favors.
"The bottom line is we're not going to agree to anything that would be disruptive to the school system," he said.
 
Possible Savings in Millions
 A pension consultants' study, he said, calculated that the savings from an early-retirement plan for all supervisors could range from $1.7 million to $7.6 million.
Mr. Singer is clearly eager to see his plan enacted because it would make all his members happy: Retiring principals and assistant principals would get richer benefits, and other assistant principals would have opportunities for promotion.
 
Once Burned, Twice Cautious
 Responding to those who worry about turmoil because of a vacuum in leadership, he said, "I don't accept the premise that our assistant principals are not quite well trained to take on the responsibility of being principals."
"It's got to be good for the system or we're not going to do it," the union leader said. "We feel it would be a big plus for women and minorities."
That argument was similar to one made by Ninfa Segarra, the board's Bronx representative.
"The great risk is not to take advanatge of an opportunity for savings and for improving the demographics of the work force," she said. She said ways could be found to hold disruption to schools in check.
Despite his support for early retirement for principals, Mr. Petrides, a former dean at the College of Staten Island, said that his experience at the City University of New York led him to be cautious. The university, which used a retirement incentive plan in 1986, lost professors who were hard to replace and did not achieve the savings it sought or its affirmative action goals.
"It can in the long term be very positive," he said. "It can also be an absolute disaster."

HEADLINE: North Korea Agrees to Nuclear Plant Inspections

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 8

 BODY:
North Korea has told the International Atomic Energy Agency that it would sign an agreement allowing international inspection of all of its nuclear installations, including those that the United States said were part of a project to build nuclear weapons, the agency said today.
The announcement, which came after a meeting on Friday in Vienna between the agency's director, Hans Blix, and a group of senior North Korean diplomats, is potentially the first break in the standoff over the mysterious plant at Yongbyon, just north of the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. In the past North Korea has said it would allow international inspection only if the United States removed all of its nuclear weapons and its troops from South Korea. 
 A spokesman for the agency, Hans Friedrich Meyer, said by telephone from Vienna that the North appeared to drop that demand at the meeting. "Yesterday they said that they will sign the agreement after negotiations that they would limit to purely technical matters," Mr. Meyer said. He defined those matters as questions of inspection scheduling and procedures.
North Korea, however, has made no public statement about changes in its demands about the American weapons and military presence in the South. In Seoul, South Korea's Foreign Ministry said today that "reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency appear to be true." It added that "we will closely watch the process until North Korea finally signs the accords."
 
Sign of Growing Anxiety
 The apparent change in tone in Vienna is the latest sign that the Government of Kim Il Sung, North Korea's aging President, is growing increasingly worried about its diplomatic isolation.
 Less than two weeks ago, Pyongyang said it would "reluctantly" agree to apply for separate membership in the United Nations. Previously it had insisted that the North and South enter as one country, under the North's communist leadership, but the Soviet Union made it clear that it would no longer block South Korea from entering the United Nations independently. China's Prime Minister, Li Peng, is believed to have conveyed a similar message when he visited Pyongyang recently.
Mr. Meyer said he did not know what prompted the new statements by the North Koreans, who were represented by a special envoy, Chon Chung-kuk. But, he said, "There is obviously a lot of pressure on them."
In fact, in recent weeks the nuclear installation in Yongbyon has received considerable attention, much of it orchestrated in Washington and Tokyo, and it has increasingly become a diplomatic liability for the North.
 
Pressure to Permit Inspection
 Even Moscow, the North's traditional ally, has joined the United States in publicly warning the Government of Kim Il Sung that it had no choice but to yield to international inspection. Japan told North Korea again three weeks ago during talks in Beijing that it would refuse to begin diplomatic relations, or to provide any of the economic aid that would come with diplomatic recognition, until inspections were allowed.
North Korea in 1985 signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, nu<--and that treaty obliges it to sign another accord,-->endnu allowing international inspection of all of its nuclear installations. But negotiations over that accord sputtered along for years with no resolution, ending last summer when North Korea insisted on the withdrawal of American nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula.
In the past few months, American officials have circulated satellite photographs of the nuclear complex to government officials in several nations in Asia, to press the point that the plant could be capable of producing crude nuclear weapons within five years.
The Yongbyon complex includes several reactors and appears to be able to reprocess spent fuel into weapons-grade material.
The North has denied that the installation was designed to produce weaponry and says that it is solely for peaceful purposes. But there are no power lines emerging from the plant, meaning that it would have no use for electricity generation.

HEADLINE: Businesses Recoil at Energy Tax Increases in Albany Budget

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 8

 BODY:
State legislators referred to last year's $1.8 billion tax package as "The Big Ugly." But after passing new energy taxes this week that threaten to close factories and weaken businesses, they now may be facing something even uglier.
Much of the 65-day delay in passing this year's state budget was spent in a search for a tax compromise that would satisfy the state's need for revenues without unsettling its recession-racked economy. Unable to agree on raising the personal income tax or the gasoline tax, the Legislature by default settled on raising the tax paid by producers and importers of petroleum, and it created a similar tax on natural gas. The taxes would raise $600 million of the $1.2 billion in new taxes and fees included in the budget. 
Since January, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has steadfastly rejected raising personal income-tax rates, arguing that an increase would harm the state's competitiveness, pushing businesses across its borders. But business leaders have found the energy taxes that were passed instead so abhorrent that Daniel B. Walsh, the president of the Business Council of New York State, made the startling statement this week that in his view "anything would be better" -- including an increase in the personal income tax.
Mr. Walsh and other business leaders agree that an income-tax increase would send negative signals about the business climate in a state already suffering from a reputation for high taxes. But they predict that the energy taxes will have an immediate effect on competitiveness and employment.
 
Companies Warn of Layoffs
 Officials at International Paper Company said this week that the new taxes may force them to padlock a turn-of-the-century mill in Corinth that employs 600 people. Alcoa raised the possibility of laying off 800 of the 1,500 workers at its aluminum fabricating plant in Massena. A spokesman for the Grumman Corporation, based in Long Island, which has laid off 11,000 workers in the last five years, said the company could face further reductions because of an increase estimated at $1.5 million in their tax bill.
The state's largest utilities warned that the taxes would force them to pass along significant cost increases -- more than 3 percent for purchasers of electricity and 9 percent for purchasers of natural gas -- to nonresidential customers. Oil companies, meanwhile, predict that motorists will see an increase of up to 6 cents a gallon at the gasoline pump.
And because the new taxes cover natural gas but not coal, environmentalists say they believe that the measures will encourage the use of the dirtiest fuel while discouraging use of the cleanest, contradicting the state's own energy policy.
"It's directly contrary to any air quality considerations," said Peter A. Bradford, chairman of the Public Service Commission. "It's not a forward-looking piece of legislation."
 
Cuomo Calls Taxes 'Lemon'
 Immediately after the tax package was passed last Monday night, legislative leaders announced they were willing to reconsider the energy taxes. And Mr. Cuomo made it clear he did not like the package, calling it "the political lemon of the year."
Mr. Walsh said he thought the taxes could be renegotiated if Mr. Cuomo follows through on his pledge to veto a significant amount of spending in the Legislature's $51.9 billion budget. Mr. Cuomo is expected to announce his vetoes -- possibly worth as much as $1 billion -- on Sunday or Monday.
The lawmakers raised the petroleum business tax, which was first imposed in 1984, by 5.2 cents per gallon, to 12.8 cents from 7.6 cents. They also created a new natural-gas tax of 51.2 cents per thousand cubic feet.
Those amounts include a 15 percent surcharge on corporate taxes imposed by the state last year. Residential users of petroleum and natural gas are exempt from the tax.
 
Approved Under Time Pressure
 The Democratic leaders of the Assembly and the Republican leaders of the Senate agree that the taxes will hurt businesses badly. But with political obstacles blocking other revenue-raising avenues, and with lawmakers under pressure to pass a budget after a record delay, the Legislature approved the taxes anyway.
And although the state's leaders have agreed to take a second look at the energy taxes, there has yet to be any softening of the obdurate positions that led to their adoption.
Mr. Cuomo continues to insist, as he has since late January, that a 10-cent-a-gallon increase in the gasoline tax would be the best way to raise needed revenues in a recession.
Assembly Speaker Mel Miller rejected the gasoline tax as regressive, while promoting a modest and temporary increase in the income tax.
The Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, preferred a menu of nonrecurring revenue measures that were shot down by Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Miller as fiscally irresponsible. He has not proposed alternative taxes.
 
Politically Less Risky
 The effects of the energy taxes will eventually be felt by most customers through the costs passed along by the businesses and utilities that pay the tax, but the measures still pose less political risk than other taxes.
"It's a desired tax politically because people can't tell it's hitting them," said Donald J. Reeb, an economics professor and expert on tax policy from the State University of New York at Albany. "It's easier to disguise."
The impact of the taxes on manufacturing will be worsened by the fact that New York already ranks near the top of the country in the price of electricity and in taxes on energy. Industry officials said it would be difficult to pass new costs along without damaging their competitiveness.
"I don't know if the marketplace will bear it," said Michael L. Cooper, state public relations manager of Alcoa. "I think this tax will only serve to help our competitors, here and abroad."

HEADLINE: Without Fanfare, Blacks March to Greater High School Success

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, June 5

 BODY:
This week Kevin Wilson will slip into a cap and gown and count himself a part of one of black America's most encouraging trends: its ever-improving high school completion rate.
While the percentage of white or Hispanic students who finish high school or pass an equivalency exam has shown little improvement for two decades, the percentage of blacks who do so has been on a constant rise. The black completion rate has improved so much faster than that of whites and Hispanics that the experts are at a bit of a loss to explain it all.
 
Midnight Encouragement
 They cite the general broadening of the black middle class and blacks' historic emphasis on education. They note the contributions of early childhood programs like Head Start and the expanded availability of equivalency-exam programs for dropouts. They discuss changes in the economy that make a high school degree more of a necessity than ever.
Then they confess a bit of pure puzzlement. 
 "I'm not sure that if we added all these up, we'd account for the large improvements we've seen," said Aaron Pallas, an education professor at Michigan State University and a leading researcher on high school completion. "I don't think we've got a good explanation for it."
Mr. Wilson, an 18-year-old senior at Oliver High School in Pittsburgh, thinks of his father when trying to explain his success in school. A railroad laborer who never finished high school, the elder Mr. Wilson would sometimes wake his son at midnight and tell him to repeat out loud, "I am somebody."
"He'd say to get farther, to compete with all the white people and all, you've got to get an education," said Mr. Wilson, a quiet, intense youth who sports a whisper of a mustache and a class rank of 6 out of 182.
As good as the high school news may seem, it comes with caveats. Though graduation rates are up, test scores have not risen as fast, meaning many blacks may still be entering the job market without the skills they need. The percentage of black high school graduates who go on to college has declined. And some experts argue that the general progress for blacks may disguise the existence of an inner-city group that has been left behind.
More discouraging still are changes in the economy. With businesses demanding increasingly complex skills, some high school graduates may fare worse than dropouts did in the days when well-paying factories offered a brand of working-class salvation.
Still, when most headlines seem focused on the failures of teen-age blacks, cap-and-gown time at schools like Oliver High is a season of satisfaction. Last week the seniors there proudly presented themselves as scrape-by-class kids with middle-class dreams.
At 18, Charmaine Benson has all the demographic makings of a high school dropout: a mother who left school when pregnant at age 14 and has rarely worked; a father who was killed on the Pittsburgh streets when she was 2; a childhood in a housing project that leads Ms. Benson to make casual comments like, "Friend of mine, he got killed."
But for four years, she has been getting up at 5 A.M. to catch two city buses to go to a school across town, simply to escape the neighborhood influences.
 
Deceptive Statistics
 As for parental influence, Ms. Benson says bitterly that when she brings home good grades, her mother accuses her of thinkng she is better than everyone else. "When you work hard and stuff, you like somebody to tell you, 'That's nice -- keep it up,' " she said. "She's not the type."
Mr. Wilson, whose father was stabbed to death in an argument three years ago, will enroll at Washington and Jefferson College in Washington, Pa. He hopes to become a doctor.
The good news about declining drop-out rates seems to fly in the face of a nationally perceived crisis, as some districts have reported drop-out rates as high as 40 and 50 percent. Part of the explanation has to do with what experts call the notorious unreliability of local statistics.
Individual districts often count as dropouts students who transfer to other school systems without letting them know. And they have no way of gauging the percentage of students who pass a high school equivalency test after leaving school. At the same time, some districts are under pressure to report artificially low figures, for political reasons.
 
Closing the White-Black Gap
 A more reliable gauge of educational achievement comes from the Census Bureau's annual Current Population Survey, which interviews about 55,000 households about education and other things.
In 1970, 27.9 percent of the blacks surveyed said they had not finished high school or passed an equivalency test, compared with 13.2 percent for whites. By 1989, the black rate for non-completion had been cut by more than half, to 13.8 percent -- not far from the 12.4 percent for whites.
But the numbers for whites include responses of Hispanics, driving the drop-out rates up. The Hispanic dropout rate in 1989 was 33 percent; the figure for non-Hispanic whites, to be published later this year, is expected to be below 10 percent. Researchers say the high numbers of Hispanics who do not complete high school include many immigrants, some of whom come as teens and never enroll.
In the past decade, the gap between black and white performance on achievement tests has also been narrowed.
 
Hiding the Good News
 In the 1974-75 school year, 8 percent of 17-year-old black students were reading at an "adept" level, the third-highest of the four categories used by the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a nationwide test. By the 1987-88 school year, that percentage had more than tripled, to 26 percent. The white rate, while little improved, was still significantly higher, at 46 percent.
Oddly enough, the good news about the black progress is one that some educators resist advertising, for fear that it would undermine efforts to bring increased attention and money to the schools.
When the National Center for Education Statistics first published a report on dropout rates in 1989, researchers drafted a news release that highlighted the black progress. But aides to Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos asked that it be reworked, to stress instead the continuing problems of Hispanic Americans, said a department source familiar with both drafts.
"They still thought dropouts were a big problem, and they didn't want people to think that we had solved the problem," the source said.
 
Despite Diploma, Low Earnings
 The figures on black college enrollment are less encouraging. The percentage of black high school graduates who go on to college dropped to 28 percent in 1988 from 30 percent in 1978, a dip that may simply reflect the fact that more and more blacks are finishing high school. The percentage of white high school graduates enrolled in college rose to 39 percent in 1988 from 31 percent in 1978, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
While black men and women finish high school at approximately the same rate, many more women go on to college. In 1988, 443,000 black men were college students, while 687,000 black women were.
And studies show that a high school degree alone is an increasingly poor guarantor of a good living, since businesses are requiring ever more skills.
Sheldon Danziger and Gregory Acs, researchers at the University of Michigan, found that the percentage of black high school graduates with low earnings more than doubled between 1973 and 1987, rising from 16 percent to 38 percent. The researchers defined as low earners anyone making less than $12,000 a year, in figures adjusted to 1987 value.
In Pittsburgh, at the same time the closing of the steel mills means there is less to lure students out of school, the development of a dizzying array of special programs means there is more to keep them in.
This is particularly true at Oliver, where 30 percent of the students are poor enough to get free lunches and about half have been identified as having problems with family, the law, or drugs and alcohol that put them at risk of dropping out.
There is a day care center where student moms can leave their infants. There are small, after-school classes to entice students who have dropped out. For those who want to learn a trade, there is a cosmetology lab, a printing shop, a professional-style kitchen and an engine-repair shop.
"If you really want to get a high school education, you can get one," said Andy King, the school principal.
But even the school's special programs cannot account for the mysterious determination of students like Ms. Benson, who hustles past the boarded windows of a public housing project each morning to catch the 6:18 bus.
 
Passing On Her Lessons
 Three days a week, she again crosses Pittsburgh in order to get to a job at Roy Rogers. She bags hamburgers and hustles to make the 9:18 bus home. Last summer, she worked a second job doing clerical work in a program put together by local businesses to guarantee jobs for high school students.
Later this month, one of Ms. Benson's teachers will drive her outside the city for only the second time in her life, taking her to the summer session at Lock Haven University in Lock Haven, Pa., where in four years she hopes to emerge as a elementary school teacher.
Asked how much she would like to someday earn, she pauses, and then settles on the too-good-to-be-true figure of $24,000. "That'd be about $2,000 a month, wouldn't it?" she said, slightly in awe.
Asked where her drive comes from, this surprising woman offers a surprising answer.
"I think TV had a lot to do with it," she said. "They say it's bad for you, but I think it can help.
"Like if you watch, 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,' then you want to be rich, too."

HEADLINE: GULF WAR AFFECTS FATE OF HOSTAGES

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
The invasion of Kuwait and war that followed created opportunities and obstacles for the release of Western hostages still held in Lebanon, Administration officials and independent experts on international terrorism say.
But despite the positive signals, unfulfilled demands of the captors continue to block any release of the 12 Western hostages, including six Americans, held by the Shiite Muslim Party of God, an Iranian-backed organization believed to be the umbrella group for the kidnappers. 
 On one level, the Persian Gulf crisis has removed some of the obstacles in the way of a hostage release.
First, in the confusion of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August, a group of prisoners whose fate was tied to that of the hostages was freed. In 1983, 17 men were imprisoned in Kuwait for conducting a terrorist campaign against the American and French embassies and public buildings and oil installations.
The primary condition for the release of some of the Western hostages was freedom for the 15 of those men who were still in prison at the time of the invasion. Most if not all of them have since returned to Lebanon.
 
Guarantee Against Retaliation
 Second, a recent Syrian-Lebanese treaty of cooperation gives Syria greater control over Lebanese affairs, and, therefore, over the captors. Despite the promises by the Lebanese leadership to disarm all militia forces in the country, Syria has allowed the Party of God to keep its arms.
One of the main concerns of the hostage-holders has been that they be given some sort of guarantee that there will be no retaliation against them if they lose the protective cover of the hostages. The fact that they can remain armed is seen as an indication that the kidnappers retain considerable influence in the country and might be allowed to operate even if they did not hold the hostages.
An expert on terrorism, Brian M. Jenkins, said: "The captors still have powerful incentives in keeping the hostages. They provide the groups with prestige, give them an identity and leverage with their Iranian sponsors. Otherwise, they're just another armed faction in Lebanon."
The Bush Administration has said that Iran has enough influence over the captors to force a release if it wants to, and has linked an improvement in relations with Teheran to a hostage release. In recent months, a number of senior Iranian officials, including President Hashemi Rafsanjani, and Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, have said in public statements and private meetings that the hostages are a liability and should be released.
 
End of Diplomatic Isolation
 But Iran is driven by two different impulses regarding the hostages. President Rafsanjani's effort to reach out to the West and other countries in the region at an oil conference last week in Isfahan shows that he feels confident of his strong position at home and could absorb criticism from radical elements within Iran's leadership if he were to take action on the hostages.
On the other hand, Iran has already broken out of its diplomatic and economic isolation by successfully improving relations with Europe, Japan and its Arab neighbors, and does not need a relationship with the United States.
"The war made it easier for Iran to release hostages if it wants to, but Iran does not have any particular incentive to move on the hostage front," said an Administration official who closely follows this issue. "They are moving out of their isolation without us."
Complicating matters is the fact that Iran's influence over the captors may be waning.
 
Israeli Release of Prisoners
 "The Iranians still have influence but it has probably dissipated as Rafsanjani has grown stronger," the official continued. "The Hezbollah don't trust him, because they know that in his eyes they're expendable."
With the freedom of the prisoners in Kuwait, the key condition for a hostage release has become Israel's release of Palestinian prisoners and about 300 pro-Iranian Lebanese prisoners, including Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, a fundamentalist Shiite cleric who was abducted by Israeli paratroopers in 1989.
Last month, there was a fluury of statements by Israeli officials and members of the Party of God about a possible swap that could pave the way for the release of the Western hostages. Israel said that it would free the Lebanese prisoners and 40 Palestinians captured in Lebanon in return for the repatriation of seven missing servicemen, at least two of whom are still believed to be alive.
The Party of God replied that it was willing to trade two Israelis it is holding in exchange for Arabs held in Israel. But Abbas Musawi, a Shiite cleric who is the group's newly elected leader, said Israel's reluctance to include other Palestinian prisoners in the proposed exchange was hampering a deal.
In recent weeks, some Iranian officials have linked the hostage release to the settlement of financial claims against the United States. But Administration officials do not believe that the claims issue is crucial. They say that the resolution of claims by both sides in the wake of the 1979 seizure of hostages at the American Embassy in Teheran is advancing smoothly at a special tribunal at the Hague.

HEADLINE: Under Harassment, Many Palestinians in Kuwait See No Choice but to Leave

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KUWAIT CITY, June 8

 BODY:
Facing ruthless police harassment, enforced unemployment and the withdrawal of social services, many of the Palestinians who stayed here after the Iraqi invasion say they now have no choice but to leave Kuwait.
Although the Government has not gone so far as to openly declare that it wants most of the Palestinians to go, at almost every opportunity this country squeezes them harder. In conversations with Government officials, foreign diplomats, Kuwaiti citizens and the Palestinians themselves, nobody disputes that the goal is to drive them out. 
 "Things are bad here every day," said a youth named Jihad, pressing ice-cold oranges into juice for a visitor at a hamburger joint in the Palestinian district known as Hawali.
Jihad said he expected before long to move to Jordan, where he hopes he can enlist in the army. He said that he was detained and roughed up by the police a few days ago, that his brother was wasting away in prison, and that two hours earlier a Kuwaiti soldier had come in and struck one of the waiters. His father, he said, is unemployed.
 
Recurring Themes
 In almost every conversation with Palestinians the same themes recur. Only occasionally does one meet a Palestinian who plans to stay.
One of them is Saleh Ali Odhman, a gap-toothed 65-year-old dirtied by a day of labor as a mechanic for hire. His workshop was destroyed in the invasion, but he says he can still get work, perhaps because he carries a passport from Syria, which opposed Iraq in the war to expel the Iraqis from Kuwait.
"I am come here to work, to eat, to live, happy," he said in English. "Why I make trouble? If you haven't any problem, you don't break law. If you are quality gentleman in your life, nobody ask you anything."
But other Palestinians, especially those with passports from Jordan and Iraq, say they and their friends are continuously bullied by the authorities or by ordinary Kuwaitis.
 
Brutality Investigated
 The Government's chief prosecutor said today that his office was actively investigating several cases of police brutality and civil rights abuses, and has some police officers in jail awaiting charges and trials.
"We are investigating not just one person but many, including soldiers and policemen," the official, Hamed al-Othman, said in an interview with three Western reporters. He did not provide details of the investigations or say when he expects trials.
Mr. Othman defended the police, saying, "There are a lot of police who do their jobs correctly." He said that he expected the successful prosecution of police brutality cases to serve as a powerful deterrent to further abuses, and that for this reason "we are doing our best to get these cases to the court as fast as possible."
 
Some Turn to U.S. Embassy
 He promised to protect anybody who comes forward with evidence of crimes by the military, the police or Kuwaiti vigilantes. But the Palestinians interviewed said they were too afraid to take their complaints to the Government.
Instead, some of them go to the United States Embassy, and journalists and human rights workers have found evidence that at least some of their accounts of horrible beatings are true.
In a speech in Kuwait today, the American Ambassador, Edward W. Gnehm Jr., pointedly urged the nation not to tolerate "hatred and prejudice" against the Palestinians.
"No matter how emotionally difficult it is," he said, "Kuwaitis must now champion justice and fairness for all people in Kuwait in the same way the entire world stood for those principles for Kuwaitis. To do otherwise will give Saddam Hussein a victory of evil proportions."
Of nearly 400,000 Palestinians who lived here when Iraq invaded, more than half left during the occupation, and they are not being allowed back. The Kuwaitis, who say the Palestinians sympathized or actively collaborated with the Iraqis, are so angry about this that they scarcely care that vital jobs held by Palestinians in the oil, banking and other industries are not being done now. They seem to believe that Egyptians, Indians, Syrians, Filipinos and other expatriates can be recruited to do most of those jobs.
 
Fears of an Uprising
 But the Kuwaitis also recognize that the expulsions must be handled carefully. Many people worry out loud that if the pressure is too severe or too violent, another uprising could erupt in Kuwait like the one that has shaken the occupied territories in Israel.
Although most people, even Palestinians, think a revolt is unlikely, they do not consider it impossible. People say the occasional gunfire heard at night in Hawali shows that the Palestinians and the Kuwaitis alike have armed themselves from the hurriedly abandoned Iraqi arsenals.
Mr. Othman's comments today were clearly intended to reduce tensions. So was the Government's move this week to call on all senior police officers -- about 80 people with the rank of colonel or higher -- to submit resignations. The purpose of the move was not explained, but the most common theory is that the Interior Ministry wanted to exert more discipline over an unruly police force that has been accused time and again of torturing Palestinians.
The Government also announced this week that expatriates, including Palestinians, would be allowed to withdraw retirement savings accounts. The money has not yet been paid, but it would make it easier to leave the country.
On the half-deserted streets of Hawali, far more people plan to go than say they will stay. The consensus here is that only about 80,000 of the 170,000 Palestinians remaining will end up staying permanently.
 
Leaving Can Be Difficult
 Even those who are ready to flee cannot easily do so. The cost of air travel is prohibitive for many, and they are refused transit visas from the Saudis, who control the overland route to Jordan. Many hold travel documents from places like Egypt where they are not welcome. And Kuwait itself refuses to issue exit papers quickly to many who want to leave right away. Some say Kuwait wants to arrest and prosecute more Palestinians. Others say they will be allowed out only after they spend all their savings or sell their property and businesses at distress prices.
Many Palestinians are living on their savings or scraping by with odd jobs, but the screws are being tightened.
A week ago, as more and more Kuwaiti landlords returned from exile, Palestinians began hearing demands for rent. Even those who can afford to pay are sometimes told that their leases will not be honored.
Palestinians who took car license plates from the Iraqis are unable to obtain new Kuwaiti plates, so they cannot leave Hawali to shop in the well-stocked stores elsewhere in the city. And the Government is canceling their free medical care and schooling.

HEADLINE: Parade Unfurls Symbols of Patriotism in the Capital

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
This bastion of worsted summer wools and diplomatic demeanor tossed off its suit jacket and let out a yell today, glorying at length and en masse in a celebration of the nation's lopsided triumph over the army of Iraq.
Thousands of people jammed a route studded with patriotic symbols -- from the Capitol past the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial, then across the Potomac River to the Pentagon -- to witness a huge parade of American armed might. 
 The National Park Service estimated the crowd at about 200,000. That was far below the organizers' prediction of 1.4 million, but still a large crowd for Washington, said William Spruill, a Park Service spokesman.
 
A $12 Million Festival
 It was the largest military exhibition in the capital since the Supreme Allied Commander of World War II, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, led a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue after the war ended, and it was the most impressive display of war technology in recent history.
Once pegged at $8 million, the cost of the celebration, including the parade and display, rose sharply in recent days, to more than $12 million. The Defense Department is picking up $7 million of the bill, with the rest to be paid by a group of 20 veterans' organizations that sponsored the parade.
It began quietly early this morning when President Bush laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery, then eulogized the 147 American servicemen and women who died in the Persian Gulf war.
Moved close to tears for the second time in days, Mr. Bush said in a quavering voice that Kuwait is free today because "we dared risk our most precious asset -- our sons and daughters, our brothers and sisters, our husbands and wives -- the finest troops any country has ever had."
Later, at 11:39 A.M., a single F-117 Stealth fighter streaked overhead the length of the Mall, kicking off a procession of troops, tanks, missiles, helicopters, jets, boats, artillery, armored trucks and even an unmanned reconnaissance aircraft. For two hours, they rode, marched, flew, clanked and were towed down broad Constitution Avenue past a reviewing stand where Mr. Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and 250 others watched.
The celebration also featured a display of military equipment along the Mall, a picnic for troops and their families, and a U.S.O. show and fireworks display in the evening.
 
Washington Meets Mainstream
 Amid a crush of spectators clad in shorts and tank-tops that bristled with portable video cameras and cold drinks, Mr. Bush and his entourage sported the only conservative ties and designer dresses to be seen. For the briefest of moments, powerful and self-important Washington seemed not all that different from mainstream Wichita and Walla Walla.
"That's why I came here, because I'm a patriot," said William Spence, who traveled from Los Angeles to see the parade. "We're patriots paying tribute to other patriots."
John Redding, a 47-year-old computer scientist from Rockville, Md., said: "People want to see the hardware -- the Tomahawks, the Patriot missiles, the tanks. These were exciting heroes of the war."
There were dissenters. In Lafayette Square across from the White House, perhaps 150 demonstrators railed over loudspeakers against the war and what they called American militarism.
"We do not want the media to portray the picture that there was universal consent about this genocidal war or this fascist military spectacle taking place out here," said one speaker, Sahu Barron of the National Coalition to Stop U.S. Intervention in the Middle East. "This is farce beyond imagination."
A sprinkling of other protesters, some carrying flags plastered with anti-war slogans, filtered into the parade throng. But they were quickly lost in a sea of American flags waved by the thousands of spectators and emblazoned on thousands more T-shirts and posters.
More than 8,000 troops, many newly returned from the gulf region and given a hasty refresher course in marching, made the walk of more than two miles from Capitol Hill to the Pentagon. They were led by Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the head of the Pentagon's Central Command, who was outfitted in the blotchy sand-colored camouflage fatigues that he wore when he headed the war effort in Saudi Arabia.
General Schwarzkopf stopped at the reviewing stand and saluted Mr. Bush. The President later leaned down and asked him, "Why don't these guys carry their rifles?" The General's answer could not be heard.
Several blocks south of where Mr. Bush reviewed the parade, a bold little girl ran out into the middle of the street. She handed a small flag to Vice Adm. Stanley R. Arthur, who commanded American naval forces in the war zone and led Navy personnel in the parade. Similarly emboldened, another child ran up and handed him a yellow flower.
Before the parade had advanced another hundred feet, enough children had run up that Admiral Arthur's left fist clutched a brace of flags and flowers. Behind him, his four staff officers tried hard to look serious and not break stride as they accepted flowers and flags from still more children.
Although the cost of the celebration ballooned in recent weeks, few in the crowd seemed bothered by the expense. "I think people deserve this," said Robert Nash, 30, a military engineer. "They deserve to celebrate."
One who differed was Ada Carter, a real estate agent from Washington.
"I think it's extreme, with the economy like it is," she said. "This is very extravagant when half of the country is unemployed. There are better ways of showing our appreciation."

HEADLINE: Sanctions on Iraq Exact a High Price From Poor

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, June 8

 BODY:
After 10 months of economic blockade, Iraq has been transformed from a land where oil bought guns and food and status to an outcast country where no airlines fly, no grain is bought, no spare parts fill the storerooms.
With apparently limited seepage, the international sanctions imposed after its occupation of Kuwait have sealed Iraq from the outside world. 
 In doing so, they have brought strong pressure on the Baghdad Government to offer some political concessions to its Kurdish minority, promise a kind of democracy to its people and show a readiness to comply with international demands for the destruction of its chemical, nuclear and biological warfare potential.
But the sanctions have not fulfilled another underlying objective: President Saddam Hussein is still in power, his elite is entrenched around him, and he shows no sign of relinquishing the powerful grip whose sinews -- the secret police, the army and the Baath Party -- have sustained his 12-year dictatorship.
 
Looking to the Elite
 The debate that seizes many Iraqis and foreign specialists, thus, is this: will the blockade ultimately force action by the Iraqi elite, who are seen in the United States as the only group strong enough to force Mr. Hussein out? Or will the sanctions continue to do what they have done so far -- bring yet more hardship to the poor while causing only modest inconvenience to the rich and powerful?
The argument advanced in the West is that sanctions and isolation will bring such deprivation and discontent that the loyalists surrounding the President will conclude that their only means of survival is to be rid of him.
But that theory is challenged by the fact that the senior figures viewed in the West as potential agents of change are inextricably linked to the Iraqi leader by kinship and political debt.
"The sanctions don't affect the regime," said a middle-ranking civil servant who let it be known to a reporter that he opposed the President's rule. "They have money, cars. They can buy their way out. The poor cannot."
"The big shots in the army and the party still have their Mercedes and villas," said a foreign specialist here. "That's why they prefer to be close to Saddam. If he goes, they do not know what the internal situation would be."
In practical terms, the sanctions have divided Iraqis into two groups: those who depend on limited and often inadequate rations fdistributed at low prices by the authorities, and those who can afford to augment the rations with purchases on the open market.
Within the ration system, said the Trade Minister, Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, "rice is scarce and cooking oil is one quarter of what was available before."
"The commodities available on the market have high prices," he said. A kilogram of open-market rice now costs the equivalent of $15 at the official exchange rate. Before the conflict, the price was equivalent to 72 cents.
Meat prices have doubled, Baghdad residents say. A liter bottle of mineral water costs the equivalent of $3.
The private market is supplied largely by truck from Jordan along the broad highway between the two countries that represents its only lifeline save for the smugglers' trails from Iran, Turkey and Syria. But all those routes seem to supply principally Iraqis able to satisfy expensive tastes. Over the past two weeks, a reporter traveling in the country saw cola from Syria and beer from Lebanon and Jordan in private stores, while lines formed outside the Government's ration stores for staples like flour, rice and cooking oil.
Sanctions have been lifted on food and medicines. But according to United Nations Security Council resolutions, Iraq must meet two principal demands to qualify for the full lifting of sanctions: dismantling of chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile capability and agreeing to pay a large percentage of its oil revenues to Kuwait in war reparations.
But since the United Nations sanctions monitoring committee has denied an Iraqi request to export $1 billion worth of oil to purchase food and medicines, and since Western governments, including those of the United States, Britain and Switzerland, have thus far refused to unfreeze Iraqi assets worth another $1 billion, Iraqi officials say, Baghdad cannot afford to make the purchases that it is technically allowed.
"Iraq is by and large cooperating in the military demands," said a senior United Nations official here, but has balked at a United Nations suggestion that it pay 30 per cent of oil revenues in reparations.
In any event, said the Information Minister, Hamed Youssef Hammadi, "how can you get Iraq to pay war reparations while it is prevented from exporting oil?"
Possibly the most critical impact of the sanctions has been on Iraq's annual wheat purchases of 2.3 million tons, accounting for around two-thirds of the needs of a country used to importing three-quarters of its overall food requirements.
 
Meager Harvest Predicted
 These days, as combines reap the wheat crop of the plains north of Baghdad, agricultural specialists say Iraq's own harvest will be lower than usual, making the imports more important than ever at a time when Iraq is least equipped to pay for them. Baghdad has struck deals for a total of 1.7 million tons of wheat from Australia, Canada and Thailand, but all three deals are conditional on Baghdad's securing access to frozen assets in the U.S. and elsewhere to finance them.
That seems to mean a crisis is approaching. The local harvest is estimated at between 800,000 and 850,000 tons, possibly three months' supply under the ration system.
But Iraqi officials refuse to say what their overall food stocks are, considering that a strategic secret in a war of nerves with the West, pitting Baghdad's appeals to Western consciences against the Western urge to force President Hussein's ouster.
"Where is the humanity in all this? Where are the American human rights?" asked Mustafa Fayek, reconstruction manager of a power-plant here, echoing themes heard frequently among those close to the authorities. "The war is over. We are meeting the allies' demands. So why make our children starve and die in hospitals with no medicine?"
For some, possibly with some wishful thinking, the sanctions have built a hope that the blockade will deepen Iraqis' resolve to resist Western demands.
"I think this is going to stiffen the Iraqis," said Information Minister Hammadi. That suggested a protracted confronation with those who imposed the sanctions.
"In South Africa and Rhodesia, sanctions ultimately had an effect," said a senior United Nations official, "but it took time."

HEADLINE: Woman Slain Walking Her Dogs Near Central Park

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
A woman walking her dogs near Central Park at dawn yesterday was stabbed to death by a deranged ex-convict wielding a carving knife, the police said.
The screams of the woman, Alexis Welsh, brought many of her neighbors on the Upper West Side running. As one neighbor sat by the 30-year-old woman's side, two others stalked a suspect into Central Park, where they pointed out the tall, bedraggled man to officers in a patrol car. 
 At least 20 neighbors poured out of their homes in the minutes after the 5:30 A.M. attack to offer help.
The stabbing occurred in front of 31 West 69th Street, on the north side of a tree-lined street of stately brownstones between Columbus Avenue and Central Park West.
Mrs. Welsh, of 143 West 69th Street, a former Rockette who worked for the Ogilvy & Mather advertising agency and attended Fordham University, had been on her way to join a group of acquaintances who walked dogs together in the park's early-morning calm, some neighbors said, although the police said it was not clear if she was going to or from the park.
"She was stabbed in the neck and back with a carving knife with an 11-inch blade," a police spokesman, Sgt. Edward J. Burns, said. "The knife was recovered from the victim's back."
The suspect was identified as Kevin McKiever, 34, an unemployed man who used to live at 6 West 103d Street. Residents of that building said Mr. McKiever had been evicted two years ago. They recalled him as an erratic, sometimes violent man. One neighbor displayed a court order of protection bearing Mr. McKiever's name, and said he had stabbed her two years ago and set her apartment door on fire.
 
'Did Jail Time'
 During a news conference yesterday afternoon at the 20th Precinct station house on West 82d Street, the Police Department's Chief of Patrol, David W. Scott, said Mr. McKiever "did jail time" starting last September in a case that "concerned burglary, arson and assault." Chief Scott did not say whether those charges were in connection with the attack on Mr. McKiever's former neighbor two years ago.
"He is involved in some sort of program that seems to us to be an out-patient program," Chief Scott said, but he said he did not know if it involved psychogical counseling.
The chief said Mr. McKiever has been charged with murder, assault, attempted robbery, criminal possession of a weapon and resisting arrest in the killing of Mrs. Welsh.
Chief Scott said Mr. McKiever had been charged with robbery based on the accounts of Mrs. Welsh's neighbors who said she told them, "he has my bag." As of yesterday afternoon, no pocketbook had been found.
Mr. McKiever put up a struggle as he was arrested by Sgt. Frank Ziede and Police Officer Richard Kenney, the chief said.
 
'Windows Pop Up' at a Scream
 "There was blood on his hands," Officer Kenney said.
The chief praised the community, saying seven callers to 911 described the suspect and two neighbors followed Mr. McKiever into the park.
A woman who has lived across the street from the crime scene for 30 years said: "This block has a reputation for helping. When a scream is heard, the windows pop up."
The woman, who asked not to be identified, said she was sitting on her terrace, as she does often, listening to the birds, when the peace was pierced by the screams of the victim: "Help me, Help me, I don't want to die." Soon after, she said, "There were people running all over the street from every direction."
Maddy Tarnofsky, a lawyer who lives on 69th Street, said, "The people on the block behaved valiantly." Ms. Tarnofsky said she knew Mrs. Welsh because they both were part of an "informal community" of dog owners who frequently meet in the park. "We don't necessarily know each other's names," she said, "but we know each other's dogs."
She said Mrs. Welsh was walking her cocker spaniels, Pizza and Pepperoni. It is not unusual for the dog walkers to be out so early, Ms. Tarnofsky said. Usually, people walk alone to the park and meet there, she said.
 
Man Walking 'Very Nonchalantly'
 Bob Pellettieri, a stockbroker who lives at 31 West 69th Street said he was awakened by a woman's screams.
"Those screams were blood-curdling," he said. "I could tell someone was in real trouble."
Clad only in his shorts and a tank top, he ran outside. "I was the first to get to her," he said.
Mrs. Welsh was lying in a pool of blood beside the wrought-iron railing in front of his brownstone. "She was very conscious," he said. "She was moaning, crying out."
At that point, Mr. Pellettieri said, he looked up and, 50 feet away, saw a tall man, wearing a greasy red down jacket, slowly walking away. He was walking "very nonchalantly," Mr. Pellettieri said. "That's what made me notice him."
"I was going to take after him but I didn't want to tackle some innocent bystander," Mr. Pellettieri said.
Just then, Alex Ross, an advertising art director who also lives at 31 West 69th Street, ran out of the building. Mr. Pellettieri said he turned to Mr. Ross and said, "Follow that guy," and Mr. Ross did. Another unidentified neighbor joined the pursuit.
Later, Mr. Pellettieri said, Mr. Ross returned and told him that he had followed the man into the park, maintaining a distance of about 20 feet.
 
Died of Blood Loss
 Several blocks away, inside the park, Mr. Ross flagged down the patrol car, then led the officers to the man in the red jacket. Mr. McKiever was arrested beside the bocce courts near the Sheeps Meadow.
Among the 20 or so neighbors who came out to the street was a doctor, who stayed by Mrs. Welsh until the ambulance came. "There was really nothing that could be done," Mr. Pellettieri said.
Mrs. Welsh died at 11:10 A.M. at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center at Amsterdam Avenue and 114th Street. She had stab wounds in the neck, back, head and buttocks, a St. Luke's spokeswoman, Phyllis Goodman, said. "She went right into surgery," Ms. Goodman said, "but she just bled to death."
A police spokesman, Lieut. Robert Nardoza, said Mrs. Welsh's husband, Christopher, was an employee of a Wall Street brokerage.
 
Married Three Years
 A neighbor in Mrs. Welsh's building, who asked not to be identified, said the victim was a former Rockette at Radio City Music Hall. The neighbor said the Welshes were married about three years ago.
"She's a lovely person, very friendly," the woman said. "She was a good neighbor. Anything that went on in the building, she helped out. At Christmas time, she'd help decorate the lobby." The neighbor said Mrs. Welsh had gotten the two small dogs only recently.
Residents of the building where Mr. McKiever had lived on West 103d Street said they had seen him using crack and stalking angrily around the neighborhood after he was evicted.
The neighbor who showed the protective order, Sarah Kearney, said Mr. McKiever "was a crazy, a real fruitcake."
"He kicked in my door," she said. "He broke into my window and stabbed me with an ice pick. He poured gasoline and tried to light up my door."

Iran Gingerly Tries a Bit of Pragmatism

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran

 BODY:
AFTER 12 years of turmoil and war, Iran appears relaxed. Mayors are busy cleaning up their cities. Merchants are doing a sometimes thriving business, and the Teheran airport has a new green "nothing to declare" door, through which people can enter the country less intimidated than they once were made to feel.
In such respects, the heirs to the militant Islamic revolutionary regime of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini appear confident enough to ease some of the rigor of their revolution. Yet for Iranians, life remains a struggle. Personal freedoms are severely curtailed. Through systematic segregation at work and in public places, women remain the second-class citizens that they became in Ayatollah Khomeini's years. And with an average income of $100 a month, the Iranian middle class is straining in the face of 40 percent inflation rates. 
 During a week-long visit to this country, so many contradictory signals of liberalization and militancy were apparent that the only judgment that appeared safe was that of a West European ambassador who said the regime has reached "the limits of its contradictions." Iran is at a point, this diplomat said, where pragmatists will have to face down militants in order to carry out further reforms and retain those already introduced.
The changes from the dour, abstemious and xenophobic days of Ayatollah Khomeini are, indeed, often dramatic. This month the Mayor of Isfahan is throwing a big party to celebrate the city's 400th anniversary, an occasion for which the city's captivating ancient architecture has been transformed into a majestic sight with specially illuminated bridges and flowing fountains.
Foreign visitors can exchange their currency at what used to be the black market rate -- a rate that makes Iran one of the cheapest countries for a foreigner to pass some time in. At night, in the mountains framing Teheran, tiny restaurants glitter in niches perched over waterfalls, serving grilled meats with rice and yogurt for less than $5.
 
Next Elections: 1992
 Fereidun Fesharaki, a program director for the East-West Center, a Federally financed institution devoted to Asian and Pacific affairs that is located at the University of Hawaii, visits his native Iran every year and believes that the signs point to progress toward moderation. "What is done is actually less important than what is said," he remarked recently in Isfahan.
The next parliamentary elections are scheduled for April 1992; among diplomats, there is a consensus that if supporters of the current President, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, carry those elections, the process of liberalization will go forward. But many Iranians from the heavily watched and burdened middle class warn that when it comes to personal freedoms, particularly for women, Mr. Rafsanjani is not much more liberal than his fellow clergymen. Generally, the issues of women and human rights are not high on the agenda in plans for changing Iran's political and social systems.
Indeed, the radical fringe of the regime can still make a difference. A few weeks ago, the Government invited all exiles with skill or money to return to Iran to freely invest, but a few days after a meeting in Washington between Government officials and exiled Iranian businessmen, the Ayatollah's son, Ahmad, spoke up. In an interview in Teheran, he opposed the return of the exiles, who he described as having been thieves and exploiters under the fallen Shah.
Summing it up, a middle-class Iranian woman said over tea at her apartment, "One of the greatest gifts God gave the Iranians is the ability to adapt to almost anything." Speaking of present conditions, she added that "a few things are better."
Streets, for one thing, are cleaner, now that the Government has been selecting mayors who will address local problems. The other day Teheran's mayor told shopkeepers to paint their stores and do it in different colors -- or have the city do it and charge them. It prompted residents to joke about "Technicolor Teheran.".
To find the money for such programs, the authorities are bending some columns of orthodoxy erected by the Islamic regime that came to power in 1979. In Persian, one method is called "khodyari," which roughly translates as "voluntary sacrifices." This refers, for example, to the extraction of money from parents to improve schools that are supposed to offer a free education to every child. In addition to paying their taxes, merchants "donate" money to the municipality to beautify their environment.
Still, businessmen say they have had a good year and expect things to get better next year. One manager who owns an import-export business and a travel agency said both ventures did well in the fiscal year that ended in March, even though exchange rates were chaotic.
In the area of personal freedoms, however, reform has not manifested itself at all. Iran is still a police state and the advocates of liberalization appear to have left this important field to the militants.

In the Trade Wars, China Has Learned Guerilla Tactics

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
WHEN a truck from China pulled into the neighboring Portuguese enclave of Macao late last year, American officials happened to be on hand to take a peek at the cargo. They were surprised to find Chinese-manufactured ski jackets bearing labels reading "Made in Macao."
Business executives in both China and Macao were clearly trying to evade the limits imposed by China's quota of garment exports to the United States. American officials say that it was one incident in a pattern of unfair trading by China, and that in 1990, such practices brought China $2.5 billion in extra sales to the United States that were not counted in the bilateral trade statistics. "They got away with this for years and no one did anything about it," said an American official. "They thought they could continue getting away with it." 
 While all nations cheat on free trade to some degree, China is a socialist country that has put up barriers to imports so brazenly that it hardly makes a pretense at advocating free trade. One theory has it that China may be displaying a passion for building up net exports to accumulate foreign exchange -- what economists call a mercantilist streak. From missiles to textiles, exports have become a top priority. The pressure has led many companies to evade international rules, and the result is likely to be a protracted struggle between Washington and Beijing over China's trade behavior.
Last year, the United States's trade deficit with China was $10.4 billion -- the third largest, behind only Japan, with which the United States had a $41.1 billion deficit, and Taiwan, with which the deficit was $11.3 billion. China, whose exports have more than tripled in the last decade, is the only non-market economy that has become a major exporter to the United States.
And while most Western countries say they would like China to abandon more of its Government control of the economy, they are finding that China is maintaining socialism while also learning some of the ways that exporters like Japan and Taiwan cause headaches for foreign industrial countries.
In many ways, China is a picture-perfect unfair trader. Just ask anyone who wants to sell cars here. Not only must a foreign auto company pay stiff duties; it must also give two cars of each model to the Government, pay $40,000 for "testing" and finance a Chinese delegation's trip to "inspect" the factories overseas.
While the United States has had disputes with Japan over rice and with Taiwan over turkeys, the barriers in China are in many respects more comprehensive and fundamental. The exchange rate here is fixed, most big companies are state-owned, Government permission is needed for most imports, and in many cases tariffs have been raised and barriers added in the last few years.
 
Export Promotion
 A big export promotion effort, coupled with curbs on imports, has pushed China's overall trade balance from a deficit of $6.6 billion in 1989 to a surplus of $8.7 billion last year. And trade is likely to continue to do well -- unless Congress cuts off most-favored-nation trade status for China, against President Bush's wishes -- partly because China is gradually devaluing its currency.
While they admit that Chinese enterprises often engage in illicit practices, some Chinese economists disagree that China's trade machine is basically unfair. They say the central Government has tried hard to curb some unfair practices, but that decentralization and the boom in capitalist enterprises in southern China -- just the kind of things Westerners want to see -- are thwarting the effort. "China is a developing country, and there is a cost to free trade," said a Chinese economist. "It must protect some of its industries. Is that unfair?"
American businessmen are much less sympathetic. To many, China's economy is a giant maze, with dead ends at every corner and booby traps that lead to dense tangles of bureaucracy and high costs. For instance, beyond extensive tariffs, quotas and other restrictions, China has a set of secret regulations that foreigners cannot even see. Often companies learn about them only through trial and error: sometimes a shipment is allowed into the country, sometimes it is not.
Nicholas Lardy, a specialist on the Chinese economy at the University of Washington, said that while China has curbed imports and boosted exports in the last two years, it is not clear that it will sustain its apparent passion for accumulating foreign exchange through the unbridled sale of exports. He noted that for most of the 1980's, China imported more than it exported, and he suggested that last year's trade surplus was an anomaly -- explainable partly because China faced economic uncertainties and restricted access to foreign capital and loans.
Prudence and caution, some Western economists say, thus may be enough to explain China's recent trade surplus. China is getting rid of export subsidies, and allowing imports to rise again. Its domestic economy is also rebounding and this may increase demand for imports. Still, in the first four months of this year, its overall trade surplus rose to $2.34 billion, up from $1.31 billion for the same period last year. Similarly, the United States deficit with China expanded to $2.19 billion in the first quarter, compared to $1.88 billion in the same period last year.
"I think it comes from a very deep-rooted ambivalence toward opening to the West and distrust of foreigners and capitalism," said another American economist who specializes in China. "Maybe some of those dirty tactics are engaged in because everyone is under so much pressure to generate revenues."

In Washington, Moscow's Moment Has Arrived

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A SEIZE-THE-MOMENT psychology has suddenly taken hold in Washington, a feeling that the moment has arrived to finish a lot of unfinished business with Moscow, before electoral politics or some crisis somewhere distracts everyone's attention. "Washington is a one-issue town, as we've all known for a very long time" says Robert Legvold, a leading Soviet scholar at Columbia University, "and this month, once again, it's the Soviet Union. Moscow has gotten desperate, thrown a lot of fishing lines in the water, and that has Washington all astir."
Already, the United States has settled a potentially disruptive dispute with the Soviets over the interpretation of the new treaty setting limits on troop levels in Europe. That opened the way for a major new effort, launched in Geneva last week by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and his Soviet opposite number, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, to wrap up at last an agreement on long-range missiles. If that works, President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev plan a summit meeting in Moscow this month or next. 
 Already, Mr. Bush has announced that in return for the relatively liberal new emigration law adopted by the Soviets, a change that has long been a key goal of American policy, he has eased limitations on trade with Moscow for another year, and his aides say he will soon grant Moscow the preferential trade status that it has long sought. The Administration is also weighing the possibility of extending sizeable new credits to the Soviet Union for use in agriculture.
 
An Invitation to London
 Already, the Bush Administration has reversed itself and agreed that Mr. Gorbachev should be invited, as he asked, to the meeting of the leaders of the seven big Western nations in London in mid-July, where he will state his case for more aid.
And already, Mr. Bush has sent a vivid signal to his embattled friend in the Kremlin that the United States wants to do business. By choosing as the new ambassador to Moscow not a career officer but his Texas chum Robert S. Strauss, Democrat and deal-maker extraordinaire, the President has shown that he considers this a special moment in the evolving superpower relationship.
Other questions loom just ahead, notably the timing, the nature and the scope of American assistance to the Soviet economy, at a time when it is not entirely clear what the shape of that economy will be six months or six years from now -- or, for that matter, what the components of the Soviet Union will be.
 
Ambiguity in Moscow
 Much has changed in Moscow, but not the old gift for ambiguity and double-talk. The name of the country may soon be changed from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the Union of Soviet Sovereign Republics, but Mr. Gorbachev and others insist that this does not mean that the country is any less socialist, not at all; it certainly does not mean that Lithuania, for example, is sovereign in any sense of the word understood in the West.
As the dimensions of the Soviet-American relationship in the 1990's are debated, there is a sense that the world may be at or near a threshold. Surely, one was crossed with the coming of perestroika, and another with the dismantling of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe. The next could mean the achievement of a stable, business-like, normal relationship -- if not yet the intimacy of deep friendship -- between the Soviet Union and the West, and that could mean an era when most people could sleep a great deal easier.
Yet taking the step into that new world is not going to be easy.
 Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican, said the other day that the key question for American policy-makers and the American people is whether or not a real change in the relationship is coming. Despite what he termed "this full-court press on all fronts," he said the answer was not yet clear to him and other influential foreign-policy specialists in Congress.
Many in Washington, especially but not exclusively conservatives, still want more evidence of change before they commit themselves too fully to sending billions of American dollars to the Soviet Union; old suspicions die hard here, as well as among Moscow's bureaucrats and generals. What is sought is evidence, for example, that the Soviets are scaling back their spending on strategic weapons and on sustaining Cuba. And evidence that Mr. Gorbachev has made a complete commitment to a market economy.
"So far, it seems pretty half-baked to me," said Mr. Lugar. "There's a lot of come-hither, but there is also a suggestion, among the Russians I've talked to, that if you folks don't come up with the money then we'll forget about reform."
 Europeans, fearful of chaos in the biggest country on their continent, are somewhat more eager than the United States to help the Soviets out. Hence their pressure on Washington to agree to ask Mr. Gorbachev to London.
But the grandest vision is the so-called Grand Bargain, under which vast Western aid would be supplied in return for sweeping Soviet reform. It is the project of prominent Soviet economists, led by Grigory Yavlinsky, who have been meeting for weeks at Harvard University with a group of American academics who have no official standing but include in their number Robert D. Blackwill, who used to be a key member of the staff in the Bush White House.
That approach has a legion of critics, inside the Government and outside. "It's a grand illusion, not a grand bargain," says Marshall Goldman, a Harvard professor who is not involved in the project. "It has diverted our attention from the task at hand, which is sorting out what is feasible and when. Meanwhile, the country is falling apart, the G.N.P. is collapsing, Gorbachev is in danger of losing control. You can't do business with an elephant when its trunk is going one way and its tail the other."
A major problem, in the view of Stephen Cohen of Princeton University, as well as Professor Goldman, is that during the cold war the West lost the habit of thinking about the Soviet Union in political terms, framing the issues exclusively in military or global strategic terms. The result, Professor Cohen said, is that Washington "lacks any real sense of Gorbachev as a man who has to satisfy many constituencies, who's going to zig and zag like any leader, who can't simply impose his will whenever he wishes to."
 
A New Hybrid?
 Several unresolved questions stem in part from this difficulty, notably the question of what kind of Soviet Union the West wants or can hope to see, as a practical matter, at the end of a reform process. A country like the United States? Not likely. Like Poland? Also not likely, given the size of the Soviet Union, its heterogeneous character and its history. Most experts believe that a mixture of Western ideas with Russian tradition is the best that can be hoped for, particularly if the change is to be evolutionary and relatively controlled, rather than sudden and destabilizing.
Too much Western pressure for Soviet reform could worsen a political backlash against Mr. Gorbachev that has already begun, fueled by the ancient Russian suspicion of things foreign against which Peter the Great struggled so hard. Russian officials tell American friends, "We're not a beggar nation, you know, we're still powerful," precisely because they fear that that is how they may be seen by others.
And dangerous as over-dependence on Mr. Gorbachev may be, at a time when power clearly is devolving into more and more hands, Washington worries that "what lurks is despotism," in Professor Cohen's phrase, if he is deposed.
And if the country falls to pieces? Independence for the Baltic states is one thing, a key Administration planner says, "but it's hardly in our national interest to have Armenia and Georgia and the Central Asian republics peeling off, and this vast continental country in turmoil."
Mr. Bush must weigh how much to put into the scale to try to keep those things from happening. He must try to avoid, in the cliche of the hour, pouring American taxpayers' money down a rathole, at a time when pressure from the electorate is mounting for the commitment of scarce funds to help the United States catch up in such areas as education, housing and health care. He must try to balance the need to help Mr. Gorbachev and the Soviet Union in their hour of greatest need against the necessity to provide incentives for them to continue to change.
Getting it right must seem impossible at times, with so many variables and so many complexities. Clearly, there can be no quick fix. Professor Legvold, among others, warns that "the Soviet problem will require very considerable Western attention for a very considerable length of time."
And yet, said Mr. Lugar after assessing the problems for more than an hour, "I have this feeling, this hunch, that just a few yards down the road we may have the opportunity to act decisively in our national interest by helping the Soviets, if only we can see exactly how and when to do it."

The Fissioning of the Nuclear Family

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT was the kind of demographic news calculated to bring joy to the makers of single-portion soups and the managers of singles bars. More Americans are home alone. More than one in every nine adults over age 18 lived alone in 1990, a total that exceeds 27 million people.
That news, coming from an annual survey by the Census Bureau, was one more indicator of the atomization of the American household. Like a cubist painting of a human figure, households have been continually rearranged over the last 30 years by personal preferences and economic imperatives. 
 Now some sociologists are beginning to wonder if some trends that have left the nuclear family with a decreasing share of the American life-style market are on the wane. In particular, the tendency of young people to marry later may be ready to reverse itself, said Thomas Espenshade, a population expert at the Office of Population Research at Princeton University. "You may be seeing a high-water mark on this," he said, referring to new figures that show American men marry for the first time at an average age of 26.1, and women at an average age of 23.9. The figures are about three years above the low marks of 1956.
"Divorce probability and age at first marriage may be near a peak," Mr. Espenshade said, adding that "a trend back to earlier ages of marriage and childbearing" would result in ages for first marriages somewhere between the 1956 lows and the 1990 highs. "Women in their 20's have had enough opportunity to observe both the pros and cons of delayed marriage and delayed childbearing," he said.
In the meantime, many people are still finding rest or restlessness in solitude or informal unions. Among women between the ages of 30 and 34, 16.4 percent have never married, up from 6.2 percent two decades ago. Unmarried couples number about 2.9 million.
That trend and others show no sign of slowing. Particularly ingrained is the trend toward single parenthood, fueled by the upward surge in the divorce rate in the 1970's, and more recently by the acceptability and increased prevalence of unwed motherhood. In 1990, 73 percent of children under 18 lived with both parents, down from 85 percent two decades before.

For Consumers, Bank Reform Offers Not So Much as a Toaster

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
DRIVEN by the fear that lightning could strike twice, the Bush Administration is pressing for deregulation that could change the nature of the banking system and, it maintains, eliminate the chance of another financial cave-in and a multibillion-dollar taxpayer bailout. The measure's name even has a somewhat comforting ring: the Financial Institutions Safety and Consumer Choice Act.
But consumer advocates say the legislation, which has the support of Democrats and Republicans alike, is anything but their choice. 
 The architect of the plan, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, envisions the banking company of the future offering a wider variety of services -- like insurance, stock brokerage and mutual funds -- that generally have been off limits for banks. He says that breaking Depression-era barriers and enabling banks to expand into new businesses and across state lines will insure that a healthy banking industry will survive.
Consumer groups are unenthusiastic; encouraging the consolidation of the banking industry, they say, guarantees less bank competition. Banks will become even more impersonal than they are now, the critics say, charging their ordinary customers larger fees and higher interest rates while cutting back on their traditional services of loans and deposits.
 "Unquestionably, this is anti-consumer legislation," said Peggy Miller, a lobbyist for the Consumer Federation of America, an umbrella group representing 240 national and local consumer organizations. "There is nothing positive in this for the ordinary person."
"We just sent out an alert to our membership and many of them feel deeply outraged," Ms. Miller added. "The clear lack of concern in Congress for their interests is going to mean that their fees will be higher, interest rates are going to go up for them and credit is going to become even harder to obtain."
Opponents of the legislation say Congress is buckling under the pressure of a two-prong offensive: on one side, the banking lobby led by the strapped, big money-center banks, and on the other, the White House. Both maintain that the alternative to the measure would be the catastrophic collapse of the nation's most prominent institutions and another multibillion-dollar bailout, like that of the savings and loan failures. It is a weighty argument. The savings and loan bailout may ultimately cost taxpayers $500 billion over 40 years.
Adding to the bailout scenario is the state of the fund that insures bank deposits, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. While the F.D.I.C. estimates that more than 200 of the nation's 12,300 banks may fail this year, the General Accounting Office has said the fund is virtually insolvent.
In moving toward deregulation, a House banking subcommittee recently added an amendment that basically eviscerates the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. It would exempt most banks -- those with less than $100 million in assets -- from the act, which, among other things, prohibits redlining, the practice under which banks decide not to issue loans in middle- and lower-income neighborhoods. The amendment rolls back 14 years of progress that consumers have made in forcing banks to serve their local neighborhoods.
 
Eliminating an Unpopular Tool
 The chairman of the banking committee, Henry B. Gonzalez, a populist from Texas, says he will fight to restore the the reinvestment act. But he also acknowledges that he may not command a majority of votes on the committee.
The Community Reinvestment Act compels banks to make loans to those areas that are in most need of economic development and it requires regulators to rate banks by their willingness to lend to their communities. Regulators can then use the ratings as a basis for denying banks permission to expand or merge. The subcommittee's amendment would virtually eliminate the evaluation process for most banks.
Banks have complained that the act has little effect on their behavior and only adds tens of thousands of dollars to their regulatory costs.
The Community Reinvestment Act "is probably the most unpopular legislation for bankers," said Kenneth H. Thomas, a bank analyst and consultant in Miami. "They feel it serves primarily as a tool for credit allocation, which they oppose because lending is primarily what they are in business for. On the other hand, community groups believe bank redlining has contributed to decay of the inner cities. The truth is somewhere in between these views."
While a banking subcommittee left most of the measure intact, it faces a critical test this month when the Banking Committee decides what provisions to send to the floor. And the package awaits further scrutiny from two other House committees. Last Thursday, Representative John D. Dingell, the powerful chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, expressed serious concerns about most of the major elements of the legislation in a letter to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley.
What is likely to come out of the process is a plan for financing the insurance fund, greater powers for the regulators to step in earlier to seize troubled institutions and the elimination of barriers to interstate banking. In the end, the protection of larger banks may be a loss for the consumer but a gain for the taxpayer.
But the trend in Congress has marked a strong break from past moves on Capitol Hill that have altered the financial services industry. In recent years, virtually every major piece of legislation in the area had attached some goodies for consumers. Not this time. Consumer advocates have had a hard time making even a dent in the legislation.
One change, proposed by Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts, would have required banks to cash all Government checks up to $3,000, with the modest aim of sparing lower income people, veterans and the elderly high check-cashing costs. The amendment, which had been approved by the subcommittee in 1988, was soundly defeated this time, by a vote of 27 to 9.

A Long, Slow March Out of Storybook Land

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
WHEN he became a literary agent in 1972, Morton Janklow was invited to lunch by Simon Michael Bessie, then a senior editor at Harper & Row. Mr. Bessie's summation of the principles of publishing was straightforward: "Just remember, there are never too many books about Hitler, Lincoln, Napoleon and the Civil War." For a seat-of-the-pants business, such homespun wisdom seemed to be enough. Green jackets, it was said, do not sell, nor do short stories or books on the American Revolution or the Arctic. Dogs and doctors, however, were reported to be subjects of inexhaustible appeal.
 In an industry in which it is sometimes said that market research consists of the first printing, anecdotal evidence and even superstition still flourish. But publishing, now a $17 billion business, is growing up, and many of its myths are crumbling. Stiffer competition, mergers, escalating advances and declining book sales are all making publishers look more closely at reality. 
 At the Association of American Booksellers annual convention in New York last week, there was abundant evidence of an industry now far too diverse and sophisticated for old nostrums to suffice.
More than 1,600 publishing companies and more than 7,000 booksellers were present. So too were hordes of foreign publishers and agents. In all, over 35,000 people attended, a record. Drawing them was an astonishing variety of books: first novels, reissues of the classics, stories of film stars and reformed criminals, tales of Waldo and Wall Street, reference works and revamped Bibles, coffee table books and new novels by Norman Mailer, Anne Tyler and Amy Tan.
It was apparent that in trying to sell all these wares, publishers have come a long way from the time when myth had it that books either sold themselves or they failed. Take Doubleday's "The Firm," a thriller by John Grisham, which was prominently displayed. Written by a little-known author, it was cleverly built into a best seller, partly by marketing directly to law firms through advertisements in legal journals and by seeding the market with mailings of sample books. Or there was Donna Tartt, a diminutive figure being escorted through parties as a hot new property, her mystique the object of careful cultivation by editors at Alfred A. Knopf. Her first novel, "The God of Illusions," was bought by Knopf for a sum reported to exceed $400,000.
As Ms. Tan said, "We have to perform." Forget myth, substitute marketing.
The convention came at the end of a year that has seen the collapse of one of the biggest myths of the book trade, that fiercely loyal book addicts make the industry recession-proof. With Waldenbooks and B. Dalton stores proliferating, bookselling has become more tightly intertwined with other retail businesses. When mall traffic declines, as it has by as much as 20 percent over the last year, so inevitably do book sales. Moreover, the very fact that the reading public has grown larger and more disparate means that it is more fickle. A book lover will buy even in hard times but an idle browser of commercial blockbusters will hesitate.
 Other myths are also dying hard. Instead of sticking to the old wisdom, which held that the biggest books should be published in either May or October -- to attract buyers looking for a good read for their summer vacations, or to lure purchasers of Christmas gifts -- publishers are experimenting. Increasingly, any month except December (too much competition) is regarded as a viable month to publish. Even mid-summer, once considered a dead period, is now believed to be a time when reviewers are less besieged. "The rules are less clearcut than in the past," said Roger Straus, the publisher of Farrar Straus & Giroux. "The only surviving myth is when publishers tell you the check is in the mail."
Pricing, long a myth-ridden area, is also becoming more flexible. Cork Smith, the editor in chief of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, recalls working at J. B. Lippincott in the early 1950's and having "a long and extremely serious debate over whether it was possible to price a long hardcover novel called 'Angelique,' by Serganne Golan, over $5."
Until last year it was widely assumed that no one would buy a nonfiction book that cost more than $29.95. But "The Civil War" by Geoffrey C. Ward, with Ric Burns and Ken Burns, priced at $50 by Knopf, and a biography, "Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton" by Edward Rice, priced at $35 by Macmillan, both became best sellers. Meanwhile, Random House has decided to price books at round dollar figures, abandoning the myth that $19.95 is a lot more attractive than $20.
 Still, some old adages have not been abandoned: A book that has not worked in hardback will generally not sell in paperback either even though it is much cheaper. The Vietnam war works, the Korean war does not. Fiction from Latin America is fine, but non-fiction books about Latin America don't sell so well. Forget the Philippines: the country does not sell. Aborigines are tricky: books entirely about them are not easy to sell, but works partly about them do better. And it may still be a good idea to call a book "Lincoln's Doctor's Dog."
 "It all makes about as much sense as the book business makes," said Mr. Smith of Harcourt, Brace. "But you tell me why the American Revolution is uninteresting and the Civil War nearly always sells."
 Another publisher, who insisted on anonymity, said, "The biggest myth of all survives: that we know what we are doing."

The Bucks Stopped

 BODY:
When Marion C. Moran was sworn in as the first female Mayor of Bridgeport, Conn., she was a self-described housewife and real-estate broker who had won as a Republican in a Democratic stronghold. Her fief, a once-bustling urban center of 142,000 and the largest city in Connecticut, had long ago fallen on hard times, and her austerity platform promised to reduce city services -- except for police and fire -- and raise taxes only in an emergency like bankruptcy. Last week, after city officials failed to close a $12 million gap in the $304 million budget for fiscal 1991-1992, the Mayor filed for bankruptcy, saying she couldn't balance the budget without dismissing up to 100 officers from the 340-member police force. Mrs. Moran was seeking to circumvent the grip of the state's financial review board and place Bridgeport in the control of a Federal judge. But the board promptly vowed to block the Mayor's plan and imposed a budget balanced by an 18 percent increase in property taxes.

HEADLINE: How to Crush Communism

 BODY:
The Soviet Union stands at the turning point of the century; careful injections of Western assistance could lead it decisively toward the free market and a free society. Yet a harsh chorus in the West now proclaims "No aid before reform."
Since no one seriously proposes unconditional giveaways, what the slogan really means is no promise of aid until after reform. That would mean no aid at all. And that would be a mistake as monumental as is the moment. 
 The time for the West to exercise leverage is now -- when it can sway the battle within the Soviet Union between forces pushing market reforms and the old Communists clinging to centralized control.
The Soviet path to markets will be painful and frightening -- especially in the early stages when citizens face raging inflation and unemployment for the first time in their lives. The promise of aid could mitigate the fear and persuade the Soviets to take the plunge.
The alternative is to sit back and watch the Soviet economy implode, threatening the disintegration of a country with, among other things, nuclear weapons. That's reason enough to engage the Soviets before their economy collapses.
 American and Soviet analysts, some working together, propose a so-called Grand Bargain. Aid would flow as the Soviets undertook specific economic reforms en route to free markets. Aid would cease the moment they balked. The plan is modeled on the program under way in Poland, where the World Bank and International Monetary Fund play their traditional oversight role. Indeed, the Grand Bargain is grand only in scale; its plan for economic development is routine.
The plan would provide about $25 billion of aid a year for several years. The money would come from Western governments and international institutions. America's share would be $3 billion or $4 billion a year, hardly onerous. The Soviets don't need and wouldn't tolerate a detailed blueprint. But they would have to agree to price reform, budget balance, massive privatization and legal protections for property and contracts.
The first step would be price decontrol and elimination of most subsidies to inefficient businesses. Because prices and layoffs would soar, temporary aid could cushion the early shock. The sequence would proceed along these lines:
Currency Stabilization: A $10 billion fund would support the value of the ruble, thereby facilitating trade. In Poland, the stabilization fund was never touched. If the Soviets, as required, set a realistic value for the ruble and cease printing new rubles, their fund won't be needed either.
Balance-of-Payments Relief: This would involve cash to import food and other supplies during the early phase of price decontrol. Aid might be $15 billion or $20 billion the first year, then taper off to zero within four years.
Infrastructure: Soviet transportation facilities, food distribution networks, banks and nearly everything else are crumbling. As the need for balance-of-payment relief wanes, $8 billion a year or more would be diverted to long-term investments.
Technical Advice and Privatization: International institutions will chip in several billion a year to provide advice about accounting, conversion of military facilities, management training and much else. And the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development would direct money into start-up companies and other private initiatives.
This program is realistic; it has been used in other underdeveloped countries. And it is financially feasible. Institutions like the World Bank are already geared to supervise the effort.
What's missing are commitments on both sides. The Soviets have repeatedly promised radical reform, only to shrink back at every decisive moment. Perhaps this time, the West can push them to take the plunge -- all the way to markets.

Instant Replay, Confettied

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
One of the weirdest technological wonders of our modern age, along with the fact that you can now bake a potato in the time it takes to blow your nose, is the strange case of the video camera. We have a generation of children who think life works like this: You do things, and then as soon as you are finished doing them, you watch yourself doing them on television. The result is that reality sometimes seems even more synthetic than it is.
This is the image that comes to me when I consider the Persian Gulf war parade to be held tomorrow in lower Manhattan. The parade will be an instant replay of many of the elements that made the conflict in the gulf so popular in some quarters, and so troubling in others: 
 * The parade will divert attention from domestic disasters, in this case the city of New York, which will put its best face forward and keep all the homeless people with shopping carts off the parade route. Mayor Dinkins has called this the Mother of All Parades, and he should know; he's dealing with the Great-Granddaddy of All Fiscal Crises in a city that has long seemed like America's Stepchild. Tomorrow, for a few brief hours, this will look like an intact family.
* The parade will cost lots of money. And, like the war, no one knows exactly how much. The money is coming from private sources, since even amid parade fever it was agreed that spending millions of city dollars when we can't afford to keep our libraries open or our playgrounds in decent shape was not going to fly. But private money could be spent on more enduring things than confetti and balloons. Job programs for unemployed veterans might be one nice way for the private sector to show its support.
* The parade will make things seem simple. We won, we're glad, we're great. This is what parades always do. When the Yankees win the Series and all seems right with the world, it is fitting that we throw trash at them and yell our fool heads off. But the St. Patrick's Day parade has always made me a little queasy because it suggests that Ireland is God's darlin' little patch of perfect green when Belfast is still lousy with bullets and blood. "Triumph in the Desert," its publisher has called a glossy picture book about the gulf war. Triumph isn't the word I would have chosen.
Parades are often one-word answers to complicated questions.
Perhaps there has never been a sentiment so potent in this country as the one that demanded we expiate the sins of Vietnam by embracing the veterans of the gulf war. Except for the national sentiment that said this was going to be quick and clean and done with. Parades provide a sense of closure, and of celebration.
But both are illusory. Most of the American men and women in the gulf came home safely, and that is a great blessing. But Saddam Hussein remains in power, Kuwait is a feudal nation aflame, and America has sunk back into the recession doldrums that war fever gilded for a time.
Tomorrow the usual suspects will hold counterdemonstrations, that small indefatigable coterie who protested Grenada and Panama and Vietnam, who have had a lifetime of picketing government buildings. There were others of us who thought that this war was wrong and have watched with horror its aftermath, the carnage and suffering in Iraq and the subsequent closing of the American mind to anything but our own supremacy. But we only mumbled our objections, then and now, because we feared being caught by the patriotically correct. Like the war, the parade is designed to bury dissent beneath an overdose of hardware and warm fuzzies, to say again: support the troops or else.
I think the best way to support the troops is to provide decent conditions on their bases while they serve, and to promote an economy that can provide jobs when they are discharged.
And the best way to consider the lessons of war is not a multimillion-dollar paper storm. I like the group of Catholics from Queens who will gather in a church to read the verse from Isaiah about turning swords into plowshares and the Gospel according to Matthew in which Jesus exhorts us to love our enemies. This will not be as photogenic as either the parade or the war. But at least it is not synthetic reality, not an instant replay reinforcing again the crazy conclusion that the Persian Gulf war was nothing more than Norman Schwarzkopf's grin and Roman candles.

At Home in New York City

 BODY:
Badly buffeted by the recession, New York City's economy isn't exactly thriving these days. But nearly lost amid the gloom last week were two announcements confirming that the city remains a dynamic financial and management center.
After considering a move to Baltimore, St. Louis, Atlanta or Cleveland, the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. will keep their national headquarters in Manhattan, along with 400 jobs. The Wall Street investment firm of Bear, Stearns & Company, meanwhile, has decided to transfer 1,500 employees early next year from three locations in Manhattan to downtown Brooklyn's new Metrotech Center. The firm had considered relocating these workers to New Jersey. City officials say losing these jobs would have cost the city about $200 million, justifying the tax breaks and other incentives offered Bear, Stearns to stay. 
 Short-term anxiety about the financial pinch need not obscure long-term opportunities.

Catching Up With Peter Lynch

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
About this time last year, Peter Lynch, the legendary stock picker who led Fidelity's Magellan Fund, retired at the age of 46 as head of the nation's largest and most successful stock fund.
These days, Mr. Lynch still keeps an office at Fidelity, and he works there anywhere from two to five days a week. He leaves home at 8 A.M. instead of 6:45, after making breakfast and lunch for his daughters. He leaves the office at 5 P.M., not 7, and does not work weekends. But he still eats lunch at his desk, he says, and "I go like crazy" during the work day. 
 Mr. Lynch resigned as a director of Fidelity when he left Magellan because "it was too time consuming," he said, and he wanted "a new challenge." Instead, he was elected by other trustees as one of 12 trustees for the Fidelity Funds.
In this role, he acts as "scorekeeper, judge and cheerleader," he said. "My job is to make sure that Fidelity shareholders are treated fairly."
Each month, Mr. Lynch and the rest of the equity committee listen to presentations by two stock-fund managers. While they look at whether a fund's investments are in line with its objectives, the big question, Mr. Lynch says, is: Can you tell me the 25 biggest positions in the fund, and why you own them?
In fact, the trustees met last week to review Magellan's performance under his successor, Morris Smith. How is Mr. Smith doing? "Great," Mr. Lynch said.
Besides his responsibilities for Fidelity, Mr. Lynch continues as a director of the Morrison Knudsen Corporation and of W. R. Grace & Company, which he joined in the 80's because he was friendly with William J. Agee and J. Peter Grace, the companies' chief executives. When he retired, he was besieged with requests to join other boards, all of which he declined.
Overall, Mr. Lynch estimates, the Fidelity work takes only one or two working days each month; the corporate board work takes another day or two. The rest of his working time is spent with charities.
The biggest beneficiary is the Archdiocese of Boston. Mr. Lynch says his best accomplishment this past year is a scholarship program for inner-city students sponsored by the archdiocese. For last February's black-tie fund-raising dinner, Mr. Lynch persuaded companies to buy tables "to get Boston business to hear the story of the inner-city schools," he said. Next year he will serve as chairman of the affair.
He is also chairman of the investment committee for the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and he spent a small amount of time teaching at Boston College.
Most of his activities require Mr. Lynch to keep up with the financial markets. As for his current thinking on the United States, Mr. Lynch said the economy began to run out of steam a little more than a year ago. The 1990 slowdown would have been a small one, he said, except for the added pressures created by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last summer. Now, "it looks definitely like a good-size recession," he said.
Is a recovery imminent? Mr. Lynch notes that housing is more affordable that it has been in 15 years and consumer confidence is much improved from its low levels of last fall. He concluded: "All the ingredients are there for a recovery, but there are no signs of it yet. Things will probably look a lot better in 12 months."
As for stocks to buy, Mr. Lynch demurred. "I'm out of the business of predicting stocks for public consumption," he said.
When he was picking stocks out in the open, Mr. Lynch was on the top of the heap. As he took over Magellan on June 1, 1977, the fund had $22 million in assets. By the time he left, assets totaled $14 billion.
In that time, Magellan earned an average annual return of 29.3 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services, which tracks mutual funds. That is nearly double the 15.2 percent return for the Lipper Growth Fund Index. And while the stock market suffered several setbacks of 10 percent or more during Mr. Lynch's tenure, Magellan never lost money for a full year.
What does he have to say to fund investors who are looking for guidance?
First, he recommends long-term horizons. Do not invest money that might be needed in the next year or two, because market behavior for such short periods can be random, he said, adding that "people who try to get into the market for a quick 10 percent usually end up losing 10 percent." It is only over 5 or 10 years that the stock market becomes fairly predictable, he says.
Investors should also gauge their "tolerance for pain," Mr. Lynch said, because the stock market has dropped at least 10 percent 40 times in the last 70 years, or roughly every two years. Ask yourself, "what will I do when the market drops?" he suggests. If the likely response is to sell, do not invest.
For long-term investors, he is a strong proponent of "dollar cost averaging." Investing small amounts regularly reduces the average cost of fund shares because more shares are purchased when prices are lower.
Finally, do not overpay for mutual funds. While many financial advisers generate huge commissions by selling funds that carry hefty sales charges, Mr. Lynch said, "In most cases, there's no correlation between what you pay and what you get."

HEADLINE: The New Intellectuals at the Fed

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Last July, when the Federal Reserve Board's powerful Federal Open Market Committee met to decide the central bank's next move in managing the nation's money supply, a new member, Fed governor David W. Mullins Jr., did not hesitate to speak up.
On the eve of the meeting, which is always conducted in strict secrecy and in as formal a manner as a Japanese Kabuki play, there were signs that the nation's banks were becoming unusually reluctant to make loans to business. The worry was that credit-starved companies would be forced to slash spending, weakening the already-sluggish economy. The F.O.M.C. had to decide whether to nudge interest rates down, a move that would loosen credit and might keep the economy from slowing more. The risk was that easier credit might fan inflation fears and push up long-term interest rates. 
 Mr. Mullins, by his own account, waded right in. He argued that lowering the Federal funds rate, the rate that banks pay for overnight loans, would not amount to a shift toward easier money. The banks' credit squeeze was having the same effect on the economy as if the Fed were tightening the money supply. To keep money supply growth on its intended course, he maintained, the Fed needed to loosen up a bit. His argument helped persuade the committee. The funds rate was lowered by a quarter of a point.
The ways of the Fed often appear arcane. But to the economists, bankers and stock and bond traders who track the secretive board's every twist and turn, last July's deliberations provided a glimpse of the ideas and attitudes that are shaping a broad new intellectual consensus about the Fed's goals: making inflation-fighting the top priority.
To be sure, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is the dominant figure at the institution. But the Fed is far from the monolith it sometimes appears and Mr. Greenspan, more than most chairmen in the past, encourages other F.O.M.C. members to air their views. Those inside and outside the Fed frequently mention three people on the 19-member committee whose intellectual arguments and pursuasive skills have become key to forging the central bank's philosophical underpinnings -- and broad policy.
Besides Mr. Mullins, a Harvard Business School finance whiz and former Treasury official who has been nominated by the Bush Administration to become the Fed's vice chairman, they are: W. Lee Hoskins, a Milton Friedman disciple who heads the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank and frequently dissents from majority decisions, and Wayne D. Angell, a Fed governor and contrarian who has taken stands that have earned him first the label of a dove, later that of a hawk.
Mr. Mullins, who is 45, and Mr. Hoskins, who is 50, were children in the prosperous, low-inflation Eisenhower era and came of age in the restless 1960's. Mr. Angell, who is 61, was raised in the Depression and Dust Bowl years on a Kansas farm and was a wheat farmer and state legislator. He taught economics at a Baptist college before becoming a central banker.
At the Fed, the new consensus generally favors the kind of steady-as-she-goes, hard-money policies that central bankers pursued back in the Eisenhower and Kennedy years, when inflation rarely crept over 2 percent and home mortgage rates stayed south of 6 percent.
"I don't think there are broad philosophical differences at the Fed," Mr. Mullins said. Debates mostly concern assessments of the economy and how best to implement monetary policy, not goals or the long-run course that has been set.
The new consensus, heavily influenced by recent academic research and modern theories of finance and rational expectations, is a far cry from the one that dominated the 1970's, when the Fed was supposed to smooth out the ups and downs of the American economy, and began to crumble in the 80's. In practical terms, that policy meant slamming on the brakes by raising interest rates when the economy boomed and inflation took off and hitting the monetary accelerator by lowering interest rates when the economy started to slump and unemployment rose.
In the new consensus, inflation is Enemy No. 1. "There is widespread agreement that stable prices are at all times the goal of monetary policy," said H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann, a brokerage. Some credit the outspokenness of Mr. Hoskins and Mr. Angell on price stability for the fact that most F.O.M.C. members, including Mr. Mullins, now support legislation mandating that Fed policy pursue near-zero inflation.
The consensus also embraces the idea that "monetary policy should focus on maximizing long-term economic growth," as Mr. Angell puts it. It holds that economic growth comes from an anti-inflation policy.
The Fed's change in thinking is being crafted within the purview of the F.O.M.C., which consists of Mr. Greenspan and the six other Fed governors, plus the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks, who share four votes.
Influential members, notably Mr. Mullins, Mr. Angell and Mr. Hoskins, shape the consensus through presentations at the meetings. They give speeches, have their staffs conduct research and write scholarly papers, write papers of their own and circulate comments on colleagues' work. The three are also considered adept at interacting with their colleagues both in the office and socially.
The idea that the Fed could let inflation creep up a little in order to bring down unemployment was a policy staple of the 1960's. The tandem rise of inflation and unemployment in the 1970's killed that thought. "Not only do I think there is no long-term trade-off between inflation and growth, but I think there is no short-term trade-off either," said Mr. Mullins. "If we drove down short-term interest rates aggressively now, we would drive up long-term rates, making the recession longer."
That inflation is ultimately fueled by excessive money growth is a monetarist notion that is now all but gospel within the Fed. Mr. Mullins, Mr. Hoskins and Mr. Angell -- as well as Mr. Greenspan -- all agree that the Fed should gradually lower the growth of M2, the broad measure of the money supply, to roughly the same rate as the growth of the economy's productive capacity.
Matching deeds to words, the Fed has nudged down its targets for money supply growth since the mid-1980's. Actual growth in the past four years has averaged half the pace of the prior four and month-to-month zigs and zags have shrunk sharply. "The focus on M2 targets is indicative of more systematic policies and less fine-tuning than in the past," said John B. Taylor of the President's Council of Economic Advisors.
The big test, of course, is whether inflation and long-term interest rates come down as the recession ends. Fed officials hope that will be the payoff of the past four years' policies. At the moment, long-term interest rates still reflect investors' worries that inflation will stay stuck at around the 4 percent rate of the past few years.
If in the past Fed policy debates could be framed in terms of monetary doves pitting themselves against monetary hawks, in the Greenspan Fed the doves are gone. Now, it's various breeds of anti-inflation hawk.
In one debate, monetarists like Mr. Hoskins argue that monetary policy should not be geared to the dollar's foreign-exchange value. Others, like Gary Stern, president of the Minneapolis Fed, favor fixed exchange rates, which means coordination of monetary policy with other countries.
A more basic issue concerns how much the Fed should give up its discretion over setting its goals and strategies. Reflecting a consensus in academia, a growing minority within the Fed, including Mr. Hoskins, believes that monetary policy should be conducted as much as possible according to rules. "Rules let the public judge whether the Fed is doing what it says it is. That increases credibility," said Art Rolnick, research director at the Minneapolis Fed.
But there is dissent. Mr. Mullins, for example, does not believe that any simple rule can work for long. Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed and as such the most powerful of the regional bank presidents, believes that future crises are unpredictable and that the Fed cannot afford to limit its options.

HEADLINE: For Oregon's Health Care System, Triage by a Lawmaker With an M.D.

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALEM, Ore., June 5

 BODY:
As an emergency room physician, Dr. John Kitzhaber has spent much of his professional life in the fast-motion treatment of bleeding patients.
Now, as the author of a plan that could make Oregon the first state to insure that health care is provided for all its citizens, Dr. Kitzhaber is trying to use triage on a system that he considers shamefully ill. 
 Wearing his two hats, as President of the Oregon Senate and as a small-town physician, Dr. Kitzhaber has helped his state fashion a medical plan that is the talk of professional journals. The plan is also being widely discussed in political circles and in countries, including Canada and Britain, that are looking for ways to keep their national health care systems solvent.
 
Working With Congress
 His next target is Congress, whose approval is needed within the next year if Oregon is to begin carrying out its groundbreaking plan that ranks and limits care. Dr. Kitzhaber says that the Federal Government has refused to offer anything to the 32 million Americans without health care and that now that the states are trying to solve the problem Congress must show some leadership or get out of the way.
Oregon's plan, part of a package of legislation passed two years ago, would extend Medicaid benefits to all people with incomes below the poverty level and would set a minimum standard of care for those with private insurance. It would do this by rationing treatments, based on a list of what would be covered and what would not. The current system, Dr. Kitzhaber says, rations people.
The Oregon plan represents a major shift in the delivery of health care from the issue of who is covered, to what is covered.
If the plan is to proceed, Congress must authorize a waiver of the current rules for Medicaid, the health care system for the poor that is jointly financed by the Federal and state governments. Medicaid, created to provide health care for the poor, last year covered less than half the people living below the official poverty level because of inadequate financing by the states and Federal Government.
"If we can force the debate to one between the current system and what Oregon is offering, I'm convinced we will win, because the current system is indefensible," Dr. Kitzhaber said.
Wearing jeans and a floral tie, Dr. Kitzhaber was working the Oregon Legislature in the last days of the session, which is expected to end in mid-June. It has been another year of triumph for his health bill, which was born amid headlines and controversy and has now moved to center stage as one of the most talked-about ideas in health care.
The man behind the experiment is a 44-year-old native of the Northwest who practices politics and medicine with equal fervor. A graduate of Dartmouth College, he received his M.D. from the University of Oregon Medical School and has practiced medicine for 17 years in Roseburg, in the timber country of southwestern Oregon. A liberal Democrat, he was first elected to the Oregon Legislature in 1978, and is in his fourth term as President of the Senate.
 
The Plan's Birth
 Dr. Kitzhaber says his idea was born of frustration at seeing "people we were lopping off on one end of the system ending up in the emergency room." His plan was to have a system that emphasized preventive care, he said, and this was codified in the rationing list.
"Believe me, I'd prefer a Federal solution," Dr. Kitzhaber said, "but we can't wait for Congress to get its act together while 40,000 children in the United States die, every year, before their first birthday."
After much uproar in the early stages of the Oregon plan, criticism in this state has been muted. The priority list, ranking 808 disorders and their treatments based on a formula that is equal parts mathematics and public opinion, has received international attention as a pioneering experiment.
As it is, 204,000 Oregonians who qualify for Medicaid receive a relatively rich package of medical benefits, while those who are not poor enough -- mostly people in low-paying jobs -- receive nothing. Medicaid would be extended to an additional 77,000 people here, that is, everybody below the Federal poverty level, and the benefits would be trimmed, based on the list.
The cutoff, the line below which public financing would not be provided, is to be drawn in the next few weeks as the state Legislature finishes its budget deliberations. Officials say that if $30 million is added, as expected, to Oregon's current annual share of Medicaid of $257 million, then the line on the list will be drawn somewhere around 600. The 200 or so disorders and treatments that would not be covered include lung transplants, acne, Parkinson's disease, reconstructive breast surgery and terminal AIDS with less than 10 percent chance of survival. Those who are terminally ill can get hospice care, counseling and medication for pain relief through the plan.
Some early critics, among them businesses and groups representing the poor, have largely become allies of Dr. Kitzhaber.
 
Covering Everybody
 "The reason we're winning converts is because everybody in Oregon is going to be covered, one way or the other," he said, "and we're doing it with a concise model for how to contain costs."
Dr. Kitzhaber said the two basic models for national health care -- one financed primarily by employers and the other by government -- were doomed to failure until they addressed the question of keeping costs down.
"Congress has not had the guts to look at the fundamental question, which is: What medical services are really appropriate and what are not?" he said.
By assuring everyone a minimum level of care -- even if that means one system for the rich and one for the poor -- the most glaring leaks in the system are covered, he said. As an example, he noted that a family of three with an income of $5,500 a year is considered too wealthy to qualify for Medicaid in most states. But that family would be covered in Oregon.
"That is rationing of health care, and legislative bodies do it every budget cycle," he said.
The Oregon plan is not without critics. In Congress, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, and a leading voice on health care issues, said he was concerned that Oregon set a bad example by taking an already small pie and cutting it into more pieces, taking benefits away from the poorest of society.
A similar complaint was made by members of the Children's Defense Fund, which follows medical and social issues affecting children. "It's not that we object to rationing, per se, it's just that we don't like singling out children, who make up half the Medicaid population, for rationing," said Molly McNulty, a health specialist with the group. "We are not defending the status quo, but we don't see the answer as scaling things back."
 
Answering the Critics
 Dr. Kitzhaber says he is perplexed at criticism from those with whom he has always felt a political kinship. "They are measuring the Oregon plan against an ideal world, and, of course, it's got problems when you put it that way," he said.
The states, Oregon among them, continue to be the innovators in universal health care, but with mixed results. Hawaii's system requires that employers provide insurance for their workers, but it does not address the poor who are working part time and do not qualify for Medicaid. Massachusetts has a similar plan, but it is threatened by the recession.
Oregon's plan, even the part that requires employers to provide insurance, would use the priority list to keep costs down and still assure a minimum level of care.
In an editorial in last month's Journal of the American Medical Association, the Oregon plan was described as "a bold attempt to maximize health care benefits" and "an ambitious experiment that should be encouraged."
Dr. Kitzhaber says that trying something as innovative as a universal health system is much easier in a state like Oregon, with its population of less than 3 million and its growing economy. "Of course, it helps to be a doctor and President of the State Senate," he said.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
When the Subject Is Civil Rights, There Are Two George Bushes

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

 BODY:
George Bush, the man whose Presidential campaign benefited from the now notorious Willie Horton commercials, also has the distinction of having appointed the first black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell. He will be remembered as a President who vetoed a civil rights bill in 1990 and, if he carries through with his threat, again in 1991, while making a point of donating half the proceeds from his autobiography, "Looking Forward," to the United Negro College Fund.
Images of Mr. Bush's relations with blacks collide at odd angles, revealing no coherent pattern other than contradiction. It is a Janus-like approach that allows his enemies or supporters to choose the lens through which they view him -- as an enlightened healer or a cynical opportunist. And combined with his flip-flops on issues like abortion, "voodoo economics" and "no new taxes," his approach to race raises a broader question: Is there no coherent pattern, or no coherent value system? 
 The President says he would veto the job discrimination bill approved last week in the House by a vote of 273 to 158, contending that it would force employers to adopt hiring and promotion quotas. Recently his top aides helped undermine efforts by civil rights groups and corporate executives to hammer out a compromise bill they hoped would satisfy the President's objections. Critics said that Mr. Bush was more interested in using quotas as a political issue than in having the bill enacted.
Mr. Bush clearly believes, with some justification, that he has fought for equality, and he and his associates display flashes of outrage when faced with accusations of insensitivity to the rights of any American. "He would be so offended by any kind of prejudice and racism that it must be terribly painful to have those kinds of charges hurled at him, particularly in light of his record," said Sheila Tate, Mr. Bush's press secretary during his Presidential campaign. Associates of Mr. Bush also cite polls showing he has a high approval rating among blacks.
Mr. Bush's history reveals a man whose public and private life has included both episodes of moral courage and incidents that his opponents say demonstrate either racial insensitivity or a willingness to use the racial card for political gain.
In 1948, as a student at Yale, he led a fund-raising drive for the United Negro College Fund, following the lead of his father, former Senator Prescott Bush, who had been chairman of the group's fund-raising appeals in Connecticut.
But as a candidate for the Senate from Texas in 1964, Mr. Bush came out against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the landmark law that ended segregated lunch counters, restrooms, movie theaters and other public accommodations, and made employment discrimination illegal. In the campaign, Mr. Bush said the law was "politically inspired and is bad legislation in that it transcends the Constitution." He was essentially following the lead of his party's Presidential candidate, Barry Goldwater, who had denounced the bill.
 
Hopes and Regrets
 Three years ago, writing in his autobiography about his successful 1966 race for the House, Mr. Bush lamented that it was "both puzzling and disappointing" that he attracted so few black votes. "My hope had been that a Republican candidate might be able to break the Democratic Party's grip on black voters in the area," he wrote. "As county G.O.P. chairman, I'd placed our party funds in a black-owned bank and opened a party office with a full-time staff near Texas Southern, one of the state's major black colleges." In the book, Mr. Bush didn't mention his opposition to the 1964 civil rights bill.
In 1968, when the cause of civil rights was more politically popular, following the murder of Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Bush voted for the Fair Housing Act, legislation that banned discrimination in housing. The vote touched off a firestorm of criticism within his conservative Congressional district. As Mr. Bush describes the situation in his autobiography, he faced down conservative critics of the vote at a meeting in his district, saying, "Somehow it seems fundamental that a man should not have a door slammed in his face because he is a Negro."
Mr. Bush seemed to be carrying on the theme of racial justice in 1988 when as Vice President he brokered a deal between Congressional backers and critics in the Reagan Administration of a bill that significantly strengthened the Fair Housing Act.
But that same year, Mr. Bush left himself open to charges of racial insensitivity when his Presidential campaign benefited from advertisements depicting the case of Willie Horton, the black inmate who raped a white Maryland woman while on a furlough program from a Massachusetts prison.
 
The Horton Case
 Mr. Bush said the Horton case simply highlighted his Democratic opponent Michael S. Dukakis's approach to crime. But many blacks were offended by the racial overtones and Lee Atwater, Mr. Bush's campaign manager, apologized for the commercials before he died last year from a brain tumor.
And so the contradictions continue. In addition to yearly donations of about $1,000 to the United Negro College Fund, Mr. Bush contributes on average $750 annually to Morehouse College, the black school in Atlanta on whose board of trustees his wife has served since 1983. Yet he has also at times displayed a startling myopia to conduct many blacks might find offensive.
Ten days ago he denounced the civil rights bill now before Congress in a speech at the F.B.I. Academy in Quantico, Va. In choosing this forum, Mr. Bush seems to have ignored the sensitivities of many blacks to the F.B.I.'s history of trying to discredit Martin Luther King Jr. Last August, without admitting any wrongdoing, the agency agreed to a $1 million out of court settlement with a black agent who charged that he had been harassed because of his race.
 
High in the Polls
 Still, the President remains popular among black voters, at times achieving an approval rating of 70 per cent in the New York Times/CBS News Polls. Even with his threatened veto of the civil rights bill, he racked up a 58 percent approval rating among non-whites in a Gallup poll released on June 2. In comparison, Ronald Reagan averaged an approval rating of 23 per cent among non-whites in the eight years of his Presidency and was never able to top a 50 per cent approval rating.
"Bush enjoyed one major advantage -- not being Reagan," said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the Congressional delegate from the District of Columbia. "He has done cosmetic things in office, but it is difficult to cite evidence of policy improvement in favor of minorities and poor people over his predecessor."
Two memos written by The Nathan Group Inc., a black political consulting company hired by the Republican National Committee, lay out a strategy to attract more black voters "without compromising a single plank in the Republican platform." Whether by design or coincidence, Mr. Bush appears to have followed the company's recommendations almost to the letter.
In March 1989 the Nathan Group recommended that the President meet with the Congressional Black Caucus "for the sole purpose of listening, and showing his sensitivity to black issues and a rapport." Two months later Mr. Bush met with 20 members of the caucus, the first time the group had been to the White House in eight years.
Among the recommendations made in a second memo, written in February, was that Mr. Bush look for opportunities to attend "significant black events such as speaking at major black institutions like Hampton University." Four weeks ago, Mr. Bush gave the commencement address at Hampton.
"In politics, perceptions are the only reality," The Nathan Group wrote. "The only thing that's going to count when black Americans consider the merits of the Republican Party is how their perceptions have been molded, negatively or positively."
But political consultants, like television programmers and advertising executives, have a way of underestimating the public. In a country still so divided, 27 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, voters both black and white may be less impressed by grand gestures than by concrete plans to lead them out of a dangerous racial impasse.

7-Year Hiatus On Malls Ends

BYLINE: By LETTICE STUART

 BODY:
THE Mall of the Mainlands, the first shopping mall built in the Houston area in seven years, has leased 60 percent of its 768,000 square feet and lured stores away from Galveston and Texas City.
The mall, which opened in March in this small town 35 miles southeast of Houston, is a joint venture of the Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation of Youngstown, Ohio, and the MGHerring Group of Dallas. 
 Plans had been on the drawing board since the MGHerring Group optioned the 122-acre site in 1978. M.G. Herring, the company's chief executive officer, said he bought the property expecting to build a mall within a few years, but had to shelve those plans when Houston's bubble burst in the mid-80's.
A flurry of overbuilding during the boom times, compounded by a sluggish economy that put many retailers out of business, left Houston with a glut of retail space. The last malls built in the Houston area were the 1.2 million-square-foot Deerbrook Mall and the 822,000-square-foot West Oaks Mall; both opened in 1984.
Another factor, the unavailability of financing, is a problem that has dramatically affected the shopping center industry nationwide, said Don Pendley, a spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers in New York City. Only 1,019 new centers were built in 1990, a 50 percent drop from the high of 2,036 built in 1986.
Texas City, with a population of 45,000, is the nation's 17th busiest port, specializing in imported crude oil, bulk minerals and dry chemicals. It is 15 miles from the growing tourist beach resort of Galveston on the Gulf of Mexico and is surrounded by small towns with few stores.
Normally, the geographic area that a retail development draws from -- called the trade area -- has five to six square feet of department and discount store space per person, but the Galveston County area has fewer than three, Mr. Herring said. Many shoppers have been going to the nearest regional malls, 13 and 22 miles away, he said.
In 1989, with Houston rebounding and DeBartolo as a partner, construction of Mall of the Mainland began. When it opened, 52 percent of its space was leased. Two anchors were Sears, which closed its store in Galveston's Galvez Mall, and J. C. Penney, which closed its downtown Texas City store.
The mall is DeBartolo's first shopping center in the Houston area. The Ohio firm, which began with a 48,000-square-foot shopping plaza in 1949, now owns or manages more than 86 million square feet of retail space in the country.

 BODY:
In the walnut-paneled mansfield room of the Capitol building in Washington, some 90 guests had eaten their fill of chicken with lemon sauce and a troop of white-coated waiters had begun clearing the dishes. As the decibel level rose, a woman slipped away from her table and, thick white hair peeking from the coiffe of her navy-blue habit, started to make her rounds.
Pausing at a nearby table, Sister Irene Kraus said a few words that set off peals of laughter. Then, linking arms with a diner, she led him briskly across the room to greet another guest. A moment later, chatting with two nuns, she broke into an impromptu dance. Sister Irene, 66, is the chief executive of the Daughters of Charity National Health System, the largest private, nonprofit hospital chain in the country. In fact, with its 36 acute-care hospitals, 19 other health-care facilities and net revenues last year of $3.1 billion, the Daughters are right behind such for-profit giants as Hospital Corporation of America and Humana. 
 The dinner in the Mansfield Room last summer was a gathering of the top executives from the system's eastern region, and Sister Irene was clearly in her element. "Work the crowd, work the crowd," she said with a resigned grin as she returned to her table for dessert. "We don't like to admit it, but there's a little bit of the political animal in all of us."
Sister Irene has had ample opportunity to exercise her political talents over the years -- as the chief executive of six successive Daughters' hospitals, as past chairman of the American Hospital Association (the only woman to hold that position) and as the guiding force behind the merger that created the hospital chain in 1986. Now she confronts two major tasks, which she sums up as "margin and mission."
Even before establishing the first Catholic hospital in the United States in 1828, the Daughters were dedicated to treating the poor. Each hospital in the chain, for example, is required to devote at least 25 percent of its operating income to that mission. At the same time, the Daughters are, financially speaking, on their own; today, more than ever, their survival depends on their ability to make tough, cost-effective decisions.
Expenses in the $221 billion hospital industry have risen at nearly twice the rate of inflation since 1984, while reimbursements from Medicaid, Medicare and private insurers have been drastically scaled back. Yet, at a time when most hospitals, profit and nonprofit alike, are losing money, the Daughters of Charity have managed to stay in the black -- and to win a top-of-the-industry Aa bond rating from Moody's Investors Service.
That performance flies in the face of the conventional wisdom, which holds that nonprofits are not serious businesses: They put mission ahead of margin, and thus lack the kind of efficiency achieved when the total focus is on earning a profit for shareholders. Of late, however, such informed observers as Peter F. Drucker have challenged that perception, noting a dramatic increase in the ranks of disciplined, innovative managers in the nonprofit sector. Sister Irene is one of the new breed.
Traditionally, the task of determining the right balance between margin and mission has been in the hands of the sisters themselves. That is rapidly changing as their ranks thin, in line with the dramatic decline in the number of American nuns. Lay people are already in charge of close to half of the Daughters' facilities. The final verdict on Sister Irene's stewardship may well depend on her success in inculcating the order's values in the laymen who will be running the system in the years ahead.
Go as slow as you want to on this matter, Jerry." Sister Irene was seated in her modest office in the Daughters' three-story, brick-and-glass headquarters in Maryland Heights, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis; her words were addressed to her chief financial officer. "People aren't quite ready for this one yet, so we might as well drag our feet. Don't you think?" Jerry P. Widman nodded and jotted down a few words on a pad.
The matter at hand was a proposal to require all hospitals in the chain to observe a common fiscal year-end. That would make accounting easier on the national level but raise some hackles among individual units. Sister Irene was concerned that the national office -- a staff of 108 people with a $12 million-a-year budget -- might be imposing too many new rules on its members. According to Sister Theresa Peck, the chief operating officer, Sister Irene's "instinctive sense of timing -- when to go ahead and when to pull back" is among the most indispensable of her managerial skills.
At meetings with her aides and in private conversation, the C.E.O. is typically forthright and amiable, often finishing her pronouncements with a small chuckle. Sometimes, though, the stern schoolmarm surfaces. On the agenda of her session with Widman was a real estate project that the Daughters had invested in at the behest of his money managers. Widman warned that the project was in some trouble. "We need to keep an eye on it," he said. Sister Irene responded curtly, "That's your job, sir."
But a moment later, the sun broke through again as she praised him for masterminding a Boston hospital's debt refinancing -- a maneuver that will save the facility $800,000 a year.
The Daughters' system is big business. Its hospitals, nursing homes, psychiatric centers and other medical facilities are scattered across the nation, primarily in urban settings; with 12,270 beds in service (out of 14,949 licensed beds) it is bigger than the next two largest Catholic systems combined. (About 10 percent of the country's hospitals are nonprofits operated by Catholic groups. In 1989, the latest year for which numbers are available, nonprofits as a whole accounted for 3,220 of America's 5,455 community hospitals. A mere 769 of the community hospitals were for-profit, and the remainder were facilities supported, in whole or part, by local and state governments.)
The order of the Daughters of Charity was founded in France in 1633 by St. Vincent de Paul and St. Louise de Marillac to care for "the sick, aged, infirm and necessitous persons," and the Daughters in the United States to this day look to the French motherhouse for guidance. Each of the hospitals reports to one of four regional headquarters. The regions were originally autonomous; five years ago, the single Daughters of Charity system was created.
The potential advantages of the move were clear: economies of scale, a wider sample from which to draw promising lay executives and a chance to develop what Sister Irene calls strong core values. Money management represented another opportunity. Now, at the end of each business day, cash from all the hospitals flows into a central national account and is invested at preferred rates. The financial bulk of the chain is such that its facilities can be self-insured, at minimal cost, with each member hospital paying an annual "premium" to the national office. Similarly, the 26 largest hospitals cross-guarantee each others' financial obligations.
"The genius behind a system like this one," says Charles J. Nellans, a research analyst at John Nuveen & Company in Chicago, "is that they reach a balance. Some hospitals have a bad year, another in another state will have a good year."
Yet the decision to merge was not easily made, and the restructuring of responsibilities has been an agonizing, years-long process. The basic problem was right out of a business school case study: How much authority would the individual regions and hospitals be willing to cede to the new national system? The person chosen to lead the national office would have to be a paragon: respected, patient, tough-minded, experienced in the ways of hospitals and the Daughters.
All of which led to Sister Irene, then chief executive of the 540-bed St. Vincent's Medical Center in Jacksonville, Fla.
Sister Irene's approach to the merger was clear from the start. "We wanted to keep as much function down at the local level as possible," she says, "without losing our ability to perform as a national system." The old fragmented reporting structure remains -- the local hospitals, the regions and the national system all maintain their own boards of directors. The regions retain much of their control over individual hospitals, including the authority to appoint chief executives, and the managers of the local hospitals take care of day-to-day operations and do their own fund raising.
Yet, bit by bit, the national office has taken on new responsibilities, including strategic planning, government affairs and auditing. Regions contemplating capital outlays of more than $10 million must now clear them with national. These changes have not always been greeted with enthusiasm. Some hospitals resented being forced to hire an internal auditor who reports directly to national headquarters. Others complain that headquarters does not sufficiently consult them before issuing new policies.
Sister Irene strongly disputes that charge; she points out that hospitals have 60 days to respond to any proposed system-wide policy before it is submitted to the national board for approval. What really keeps the system running smoothly, though, is an informal communications network. Proposals are hashed over endlessly in casual conversations in the halls or on the telephone. By the time any issue arrives formally at the national level, chances are a consensus has been reached.
At the center of this network is Sister Irene. She spends 60 percent of her time on the road, visiting virtually every hospital at least once a year. She knows them all intimately. On arrival at a facility, she walks about, meeting old friends, listening to problems, offering advice. The topics range from financial tactics to personal career choices to religion. Back at the office, the same process is transferred to the telephone.
Meanwhile, she supervises the national office. "It's amazing how accessible she is," says David H. LeMoine, senior vice president in charge of audit services. "It's hard for me to do anything wrong because I run practically everything by her first."
St. Vincent started the order to care for the poor," says Sister Irene, "but where did he spend most of his time? In the courts of France, that's where, sashaying around with all the ladies and the kings and the princes. And what for?" She rubs thumb and fingers together. " 'Give me your money,' he said." But times have changed; charitable gifts, royal or otherwise, no longer suffice. "In the United States in this day and age," says Sister Irene, "the way to do it is to run institutions that are financially solid."
Her own institution fits the description. "It's a very, very strong system," says Nellans of John Nuveen, which holds a sizable quantity of the Daughters' bonds. The privately placed bonds are issued by the Daughters to fund their capital investments. The system's approach is a model of conservative finance. "Our goal," says Jerry Widman, "is to have funds on hand equal to the amount of our debt." That sounds like a pipe dream in modern America, yet, as of 1990, the chain's indebtedness was $1.1 billion and its cash and short-term holdings totaled over $900 million.
The typical American company today, having made a $30 million investment in capital goods, will amortize it at the rate of $1 million a year but not actually set aside the cash needed to replace those goods when they wear out. The Daughters will.
The Daughters' vital signs are impressive. Their hospitals' occupancy rate for 1989 was 73 percent, some 7 percent above the industry at large. Currently, only five of the system's hospitals are operating at a loss. In fiscal 1990 the Daughters realized a surplus of about $190 million.
"Hospitals used to operate under the Robin Hood philosophy," says David J. Sauer, a vice president of the St. Louis-based Catholic Health Association. "Paying patients and third-party providers would, in effect, subsidize charity care."
But in 1984 Medicare and Medicaid, overwhelmed by health-care cost inflation, began limiting how much they would reimburse hospitals and doctors for specific procedures. Many private insurers, similarly strapped, followed suit. "The cost-shifting of yesterday is no more," says F. Dale Whitten, the Daughters' vice president for strategic planning.
In fiscal 1990, 50 percent of gross revenues from patients came from such ancillary sources as X-rays and hospital pharmacy operations; inpatient care brought in some 28 percent, and outpatient services, such as minor surgery, accounted for 23 percent. About 41 percent of the revenues from these three categories was provided by Medicare, 7 percent by Medicaid and 22 percent from other third-party payers such as health maintenance organizations.
To maintain their profitability in this increasingly pinched health-care environment, the Daughters have had to be hard-nosed and competitive. Their Florida hospitals were among the first to advertise on billboards ("When your Mom's chicken soup isn't enough," was one tag line). To lure physicians with large practices to sign on with system hospitals, the Daughters employ the same stratagems used by their rivals, from wining and dining the doctors to building high-technology-care units for such specialties as cancer and open-heart surgery.
But the Daughters also know when to bail out. After years of steadily losing business to a big new suburban hospital in Montgomery, Ala., the Daughters sold St. Margaret's hospital to Humana in 1989. In El Paso, Texas, the system decided to close its aging Hotel Dieu Medical Center rather than rebuild it because El Paso's other hospitals were already operating at less than 50 percent occupancy. Instead, the Daughters built a walk-in, primary-care clinic in one of the city's poorest neighborhoods.
During the last decade, the system's outpatient services have grown from about 5 percent of revenues to 23 percent. The move reflects the increasing unwillingness of insurers, especially Medicare, to reimburse hospitals for inpatient services that can now be done on an outpatient basis.
The shift means that the Daughters' big central hospitals now focus more on intensive care -- and that many rooms in these hospitals are no longer needed. National headquarters is helping in the conversion of such space into doctors' offices and other uses.
Sister Irene grew up in Baltimore in a home bursting with children -- five sisters, a brother and an all-but-permanent contingent of their friends. Her father, Frank B. Kraus, was an executive with the Pennsylvania railroad. As a schoolgirl at Seton High School -- named for Elizabeth Ann Seton, America's first canonized saint and the founder of the Daughters of Charity in this country -- she excelled at sports, dramatics and music and served as editor of the school newspaper and as a class officer. Along with a half dozen or so of her classmates, she joined the Daughters of Charity right after high school, in 1941. She was 17.
"I came from a home life that was as solid as it could be -- you wouldn't think of sassing your mother or your father -- and that's the same environment I found with the sisters," she says.
The order guided her into nursing. While working her way up the ladder from scrub nurse to operating-room supervisor to chief executive, she earned a bachelor's degree and eventually an M.B.A. at Florida Atlantic University.
As a C.E.O., Sister Irene frequently demonstrated her self-confidence and willpower. While head of St. Vincent's in Jacksonville, for example, she called for the construction of 15 affiliated health-care clinics across the city. The move made strategic sense, since Jacksonville's population was growing away from the hospital's east-side location, but it threatened the private practices of physicians near the new clinics. "The doctors in this city could have lynched her," says William C. Mason, chief executive of the Baptist Medical Center. "But when the dust settled, everyone saw the wisdom of what she had done."
Today, Sister Irene still lives the austere life that is an essential part of her vows as a Daughter of Charity. Her $200,000-plus salary goes directly to her original provincial house in Maryland, which in turn provides her with room and board, life-long health care and a stipend of about $300 a year to spend as she chooses.
Most mornings, Sister Irene rises at 4:30 for an hour of prayer and meditation in her provincial house in St. Louis. Then she and Sister Theresa attend mass, arriving at the office by 7 o'clock. At day's end, Sister Irene returns home for dinner, more prayer and a brisk walk or swim.
To some, Sister Irene's life might seem uncomfortably stretched by irreconcilable forces -- the contemplative demands of the religious community, her rambunctious personality, the edgy dickerings of the business world. But she seems to have reached an accommodation: "People sometimes ask me how I could go from hands-on nursing to a desk job. Didn't I join a religious community to save souls? So I came up with the term, 'the apostolate of administration.' Where are most major decisions made? Here." She thumps her desk for emphasis. "Justice, charity to employees, to patients, to doctors, advocating for the poor -- you can make great decisions and great policies from here that impact more lives than I could ever touch at bedside, one-on-one."
As nonprofit facilities, the hospitals of the Daughters of Charity enjoy certain advantages over for-profit competitors. For one thing, the Daughters are more likely to receive private gifts, though they amount to only some $7 million a year for the whole system, a tiny fraction of its revenues. A more significant advantage is the Daughters' tax-exempt status. Not only does the system pay no taxes, but its tax-free bonds can offer much lower interest rates than the bonds of its for-profit rivals.
In recent years, a controversy has flared over the tax exemptions granted non-profit hospitals. A bill has been introduced in Congress that would require them to return more to their communities in the form of charity care than the hospitals are saving in taxes. The Daughters of Charity are not among the critics' targets, having saved $65 million in taxes and provided some $76 million last year in direct charity care plus absorbing $947 million in Medicaid and Medicare underpayments and an additional $176 million in bad debts.
There is no commonly accepted method for measuring hospitals' delivery of charity care, which makes comparisons notoriously tricky. But according to the formula used in an American Hospital Association survey for 1989, the latest year for which figures are available, nonprofit hospitals on average devoted an amount equal to 6 percent of their gross patient revenues to uncompensated care, and the Daughters came in at 5.7 percent. The figure for for-profit institutions was 5.4 percent.
David LeMoine had been a partner at a major accounting firm before he joined the Daughters' national office, attracted by the degree to which religious values and a sense of mission would be a part of his new work life. Meetings always begin with prayer. Five core values -- including "simplicity" and "respect" -- serve as the basis for lectures and discussions. "Most of us executives," says LeMoine, who is not Catholic, "could make more money somewhere else. This mission stuff, as corny as it sounds, is really our motivation. At the place I came from, I was basically just working to fulfill the goals of the guy right above me, and I hated it."
The Daughters are in good corporate company in their effort to teach employees what the institution stands for. The Walt Disney Company and I.B.M. do the same. In the case of the hospital chain, though, the need is particularly urgent as the ranks of the Daughters of Charity get ever thinner. Sister Theresa Peck, who is 56, estimates that among the 350 sisters who work in the health ministry, there are only 12 to 15 younger than she who might one day be capable of administering a hospital.
At the training sessions for lay managers, Sister Irene says, "We want to talk about what you, as a leader in a Christian environment, would need to know from an ethical and moral point of view that would allow you to make good and just decisions when you consider a joint venture, or a new marketing campaign, or competition."
In fact, executives cite any number of examples of such decisions -- a malpractice suit that was settled generously even though attorneys felt the Daughters could have won in court; extra attention paid to on-the-job safety and hazardous waste disposal. And when religious principles collide with financial objectives, there is no question where loyalties lie. Abortions are never performed in Daughters of Charity hospitals, which also place a high priority on keeping obstetric facilities open.
Sister Irene is philosophical about the degree to which lay managers are replacing the religious in operating the hospitals. "Why shouldn't the laity be involved?" she asks. "We have no corner on being the only people who can help the poor. Because everything is cyclical. If and when God has a need for more of us, then I think we'll see it. We'll be back."

SECOND NATURE
A Gardener's Education.
By Michael Pollan.
258 pp. New York:
Atlantic Monthly Press. $21.95.  
 A pleasurable shiver of recognition gripped me midway through Michael Pollan's brief and disarming introduction to "Second Nature: A Gardener's Education." It seems that he and I have confronted the same woodchuck, relived Thoreau's problem when he made "the earth say beans instead of grass," and undergone the same physical and moral struggles to redeem our craggy hillside dairy farms in New England.
The author's maternal grandfather, a Russian emigre who started out in the New World selling produce from the back of a horse-drawn wagon, was a rigorous vegetable gardener who extirpated every weed that dared erupt in his orderly rows. His father, on the other hand, mowed his initials into the weedy front lawn rather than conform to his suburban neighbors' standards for an undivided grassy sward. Where, between two such polarized stances, might we reasonably expect to find this third-generation American?
Wittily, aphoristically and with great natural charm, Mr. Pollan, who is the executive editor of Harper's Magazine, discloses his considered position as gardener and humanist, sociologist, ironist and historian. He is at ease with topics ranging from the importation of Old World weeds into the New, to the proper dimensions and method of preparation of a large hole for a new tree.
On the latter subject, when opening the earth to receive the root ball of a tree in New England, expect "boulders the size of office safes." For starters, dig as deep as the root ball you are planting, dig twice as wide as deep, and fill the hole with water.
On the matter of weeds, we learn that virtually every so-called marauder we have come to pursue with vengeful hoe was brought here either accidentally or on purpose: Saint Johnswort in 1696 by Rosicrucians, who believed it had the power to ward off evil spirits if gathered on St. John's Eve; tumbleweed in the 1870's by Russians who planned to raise flax in South Dakota and carried the weed seeds with them unintentionally.
A disquisition on roses from the Middle Ages to the present opens the section titled "Summer." I found it an absolute tour de force; it enlarged my world view. As Mr. Pollan examines the social hierarchy of the old rose we traverse the Roman Empire, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the period of the Enlightenment with five major species, known across Europe. Compared with such modern cultivars as the hybrid ever-blooming tea rose, the old roses, he reports, are frankly sensual, overpoweringly perfumed and they bloom all at once, unreservedly, holding nothing back.
Mr. Pollan examines the petals of an alba -- one of the five royal families -- called Maiden's Blush. In France, "as Vita Sackville-West tells us, blooms that blush a particularly deep pink are given the 'highly expressive name' of Cuisse de Nymphe Emue . . . the thigh of an aroused nymph." Our author is carried away by the carnality of the flower. Compared to Maiden's Blush, he finds the new hybrids are "no more alluring or sexually aware" than Girl Scouts.
In another free-standing essay, "The Idea of a Garden," the impact of a 1989 tornado on the Cathedral Pines, a carefully preserved stand of old white pines in Cornwall, Conn., provides Mr. Pollan with an opportunity to discuss the community's divergent responses to this broad-scale destruction.
The Nature Conservancy wanted not to interfere with the natural forces that had been unleashed. Outraged citizens wanted the felled trees removed for esthetic, pragmatic and economic reasons. A classic environmental battle shaped up; its compromise solution gives Mr. Pollan a jumping-off place from which to examine the ethics of state-of-nature theories versus ecological restoration.
While this topic is indeed worthy of examination, the succeeding essay, "Made Wild by Pompous Catalogs," is the liveliest in the book. Here Mr. Pollan conducts a hilarious and trenchant analysis of the annual garden deluge that pours out of the mail pouch immediately after New Year's Day. For while all may be tranquil on the glossy surface of these catalogues brimming with luscious photographs, controversy lurks within. It seems that social and political differences infest each gaudy page that presages spring.
Mr. Pollan catapults us from the top of the hierarchy -- White Flower Farm and Wayside Gardens -- into the vast middle-class mainstream pamphlets from Burpee, Park, Harris, Stokes and Gurney's, and on to such counterculture houses as Johnny's Selected Seeds, the Vermont Bean Seed Company and Pinetree Garden Seeds, which exude "perhaps just a whisper of right eousness." For the break point between midcult and that faint whisper is perhaps clearest in the various catalogues' approach to pest control. From Johnny's on, the emphasis is on organic rather than chemical controls, sabadilla dust in place of Sevin, sexual lures to ensnare Japanese beetles rather than downright death-to-all powders.
The tour continues through Cook's and Shepherd's, which specialize in European and Oriental vegetables and aim to restore flavor and grace to the vegetable kingdom. While commerce has focused on the thick-skinned tomato that ships well and iceberg lettuce that travels unflappably for a week in a boxcar, these seed houses offer instead almost a dozen varieties of basil and even more subtle shades and variegated shapes of edible greens.
Mr. Pollan concludes with a discussion of "the fiery radicals of the garden world," Seeds Blum and J. L. Hudson, who, having declared war on the homogeneity of hybrid crops, are at work disseminating open-pollinated heirloom seeds. They seek to sustain a broad gene pool for the future, taking into consideration local crop conditions, disease resistance and above all, flavor.
Now these small demurrers. While I was happy to find Mr. Pollan firmly allied with those of us who oppose the wanton broadcast of pesticides and inorganic fertilizers on lawn and garden, I wish he had lingered a little longer over this vital subject. He writes about his earnest search for a vein of ancient cow manure he knows underlies some corner of his property, and we come upon him often sifting rich compost into his planting rows. But I miss an essay on mulch, a topic that gets only scant attention. Grandfather, with his straight lines of vegetables requiring continual and relentless weeding, might have benefited from opened-out pages of this newspaper topped with spoiled hay between his rows.
"Second Nature" is a treasure house of information for the serious gardener, a delightful read for any armchair strategist who has yet to pick up a hoe and as delicious a meditation on one man's relationship with the earth as any you are likely to come upon this year.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
Competitive Croquet? You Better Believe It

BYLINE: By Nancy Marx Better

 BODY:
Twilight settled over the manicured greensward in Central Park that serves as headquarters for the New York Croquet Club. Dressed in fresh-pressed whites -- polo shirt, Bermuda shorts, socks and sneakers -- Mike Gibbons concentrated hard on his last shot. "Yellow's dead on red and blue's dead on black," explained Mr. Gibbons, who is an executive vice president of Estee Lauder, the New York-based cosmetics giant. "I'm going for a rush."
Click. A tap of his mallet sent the red ball rolling. Click. It hit the blue ball, sending blue through the final wicket. He raised his mallet in victory. "This game is all about summing up a situation and making a quick decision," said Mr. Gibbons, a nationally ranked croquet player. "That's why executives are good at it. We're always strategizing." 
 Competitive croquet is a darling of the business set. The United States Croquet Association says there are 350 croquet clubs in 48 states today, up from just five in 1977. In a recent survey, it found that 88 percent of its 5,000 or so members identified themselves as businesspeople. "Croquet has been likened to warfare on the corporate battlefield," said Jack Osborn, founder and president of the Palm Beach-based U.S.C.A. "That's why it attracts so many executive types."
 Warfare? In a Great Gatsby-style game that's played while sipping champagne and nibbling caviar? Where sweat is caused solely by the sun? "In golf, you play against the course," said Mr. Osborn. "In croquet, you try to destroy your opponent." Hence, for executives, the game's charm: a sadistic streak belies its genteel veneer. "Croquet mimics office politics," said Tim Quinlan, an executive at Tesco, a Long Island-based direct marketing company. "You can really screw someone over if you want to."
Serious enthusiasts are quick to contrast competitive croquet and backyard croquet. It's like comparing the Yankees to a Little League team. Competitive croquet, either a singles or doubles match, is properly played on one-quarter-inch bentgrass with a time clock allowing 45 seconds per shot. The object seems simple: to get two different-colored balls through the six-wicket course before the other side does. But the rules -- and tactics -- are highly complex, requiring the concentration of chess and the coordination of billiards. "It helps if you're good at problem-solving," said Mr. Quinlan. "Then you can learn pretty fast."
For example, Will Hiltz, an executive vice president in Smith Barney's corporate finance department, learned to play in 1980. The next year, he made it to the United States championships -- where he came close to beating the defending champion. "I don't think there are many other sports where I could be nationally ranked after playing for a year," he said. "I could play golf my whole life and I'd never make it to Augusta."
Having a national ranking makes ribbing easier to take. "I get a lot of grief from my friends about playing croquet," said Bill Duncan, chairman of the First American Bank of New York. "But there's definitely a bit of agressiveness to it. You have to know when to advance and when to retreat. You have to map out a plan."
Since mental agility is valued over muscular prowess, gender makes little difference. "I beat men all the time," said Jean Arrington, secretary of the U.S.C.A. In fact, croquet was the first game that allowed women in Victorian England to compete directly with men. It's the quintessential "level playing field" -- which helps account for its growing popularity among convention planners.
When Levi Strauss and Transamerica, both based in San Francisco, held management meetings last fall at the Meadowood Resort in St. Helena, Calif., croquet was on the agenda. The Breakers hotel in Palm Beach conducts clinics for beginners on business trips. "It's not like golf, where it takes up the whole afternoon," says Gretchen Deweese, publicity director for the Breakers. "You can play a game in an hour or two, and get back to work."
 Like golf, however, croquet can be addictive. Robert Clayton, retired chief executive officer of the New York securities firm of Laidlaw Adams & Peck, became so enthralled that he installed a state-of-the-art court at his Long Island beach house. Several of his cronies -- including Charles Lazarus, C.E.O. of New Jersey-based Toys 'R' Us -- followed suit. "Maintaining a court is a big commitment," said Mr. Clayton. "You have to water it every day and mow it several times a week." The U.S.C.A. estimates that it costs about $4,000 a year to care for a standard 105-by-84-foot court. A set of top-quality equipment can run $3,500.
While croquet has long been associated with the rich and powerful, advertisers like Rolex and BMW have only lately discovered its allure. One selling point: a 1987 U.S.C.A. study that found members had an average income of $125,000 and that 25 percent were millionaires. "The demographics of the sport are extremely upscale," said Mr. Gibbons.
But even croquet can't escape the lingering recession. Two major sponsors -- menswear manufacturer Gieves & Hawkes and retailer Abercrombie & Fitch -- have abandoned plans to host upcoming U.S.C.A. tournaments. "They've suspended promotions for this summer due to the downturn in their industry," said Mr. Osborn. "When the economy picks up, they'll be back."
By then, with more public courts available and popularity on the rise, the game may have a more egalitarian following. "I think it's losing the elitist image," said Ms. Arrington of the U.S.C.A. "Some of our younger players are construction workers and machinists. They don't all drive around in Jaguars."

How Business Can Help in Schools

BYLINE: By ROBERT B. REICH; Robert B. Reich is author of a new book, "The Work of Nations: Preparing Ourselves for 20th Century Capitalism."

 BODY:
With great hoopla, American corporations are entering into all sorts of partnerships with their local public schools -- such things as awarding cash grants to excellent teachers, donating computers to classrooms, encouraging corporate employees to tutor slow learners. But these represent scatter-shot approaches to America's core educational problem: the nation's growing number of young, unskilled workers.
The earnings of workers with only high school diplomas dropped 9 percent during the 1980's and the earnings of dropouts fell 12 percent. Before it is too late, American business must launch a coordinated national strategy to rescue youth who are not bound for college. Specifically: 
 1. Shift educational giving from prestigious colleges to public elementary and secondary schools. Of the $2.6 billion contributed by American corporations to education in 1989, only $248 million went to support public primary and secondary schools. The rest went to colleges and universities and to private secondary schools, whose students are already well-positioned to thrive in the global economy. Less likely to succeed are many of the children in public primary and secondary schools.
2. In devoting resources to the public schools, look beyond the schools where the company is headquartered. Schools near corporate headquarters may not be the ones whose students are in the greatest danger of dropping out or of failing to gain basic skills. For example, some of the nation's most impressive corporate-school partnerships are in Fairfield, Conn. -- where, not incidentally, several major American companies are based and where some of America's best-endowed public schools already offer a first-class education. But much more in need of corporate partners are schools in poor rural townships or working-class metropolitan areas.
3. Don't starve the public schools in industrial areas by demanding tax breaks from the community as a condition for coming or staying there. In 1957, corporations accounted for about 45 percent of local tax revenues; in 1989, around 16 percent. It's easy for a corporation to get an inviting tax deal simply by suggesting to municipal officials that without tax incentives the company won't locate there, or will leave. But because individual taxpayers in many of these industrial communities can't afford to make up the difference, the quality of public education suffers. Yet these are the very schools in which the proportion of young people not going to college typically is high.
4. Give summer jobs to high schoolers. Summer jobs provide one of the best means for teenagers to become acquainted with the world of work and the discipline it requires.
5. Collaborate with the public schools to design and provide apprenticeships for jobs that will await high school graduates upon completion. All too often, high school students not headed for college are dumped into vocational-education classes that are little more than holding bins. What students most need is technical training under the tutelage of skilled workers, within apprenticeship programs carefully designed to supplement classroom work -- and with guaranteed jobs awaiting successful completion, as in Germany.
6. Hire students for full-time jobs directly out of high school. American corporations often require that employees possess some college or postsecondary vocational training before they are hired -- even for nontechnical jobs. Typically, the requirement is meant to insure that new employees have achieved a minimum standard of literacy and numeracy. A better way is for the corporation to rely on standardized tests, which high school seniors can take voluntarily.
7. Base hiring decisions on overall school performance. Students who are not going to college often fail to apply themselves in high school because they don't see any connection between their performance in school and their prospects for a good job when they graduate. That is because companies rarely inquire about high school performance during the hiring process.
8. Train noncollege employees. American corporations claim to spend almost $30 billion a year on employee training, but most of the training goes to college graduates, who are twice as likely to have access to corporate training as employees without college degrees. As a result, people without college degrees are often consigned to dead-end jobs, with no hope for promotion and little job security.
Following these eight principles may be less dramatic than donating computers to classrooms. But taken together, they offer the means by which corporate America can have an even more profound effect on the lives of America's children who are most at risk of failing in the new economy.

Tick, Tick, Tick: Cuomo Can Afford To Wait on 1992

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
If "they also serve who only stand and wait" becomes the axiom of the 1992 Presidential campaign, no Democrat can stand to wait longer than Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
Mr. Cuomo says he has no plans to run, no plans to make plans and no plans not to make plans. But the thirst for leadership in the Democratic Party and the vacuum that it is in the nature of political reporters to abhor even more than politicians (witness an earlier New York Governor's rush to fill the vacuum created by Hoover) prompt many to continue to discount Mr. Cuomo's repeated, if marginally less unequivocal, disavowals of candidacy. 
 In 1990, Mr. Cuomo declined to declare that his decision to seek another four-year term as Governor would signal his refusal to run for President two years later. He has not declared flatly, as he did four years ago during a radio interview program, that he would not be a candidate.
"Everybody ignored it and, in effect, they called me a liar for six months," Mr. Cuomo recalled. "I'm not going to do it again. I wouldn't insult myself or lose my dignity by playing the media's game."
 The more he insists that he is not engaging in any game at all, the more he tries to trans form the political liability of his home state's tribulations. And the more he talks about leaving it.
 "I will tell the New York story everywhere they want to hear it," he says, because, he maintains, that story represents the best ex ample of a state that is coping with economic and social change and the consequences of national economic policies. "New York State is as close to a miniature for the nation as you can get," he says, pointing out that it is mostly rural, dependent on agriculture and is being invigorated by immigrants: "This is the future of the country."
Mr. Cuomo acknowledges that he is likely to bear the brunt of public blame for the state's embarrassing budget delay. "How can I convince anyone in Utica it's Mel Miller's fault? They never heard of Mel Miller," he said, referring, for others who never heard of him either, to the Assembly Speaker from Brooklyn. "Just as President Bush will have to pay for the failed national economy," the Governor added, "no matter how many Persian Gulf wars we win."
One unintended consequence of the record delay in getting a budget approved has been to buy him more time. Moreover, if Mr. Cuomo indeed became a front-runner for the nomination, then another political axiom could prevail: The less time spent as a front-runner, the better. In 1992, more convention delegates are likely to be selected sooner, which means that more money will have to be raised and spent sooner -- particularly by candidates without national stature, like former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts and Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia.
"The clock is very cruel to them," said Paul Tully, political director of the Democratic National Committee.
A candidate who procrastinates risks missing some technical deadlines for organizing, elevating minor mistakes into egregious errors in the glare of publicity and falling short of fund-raising goals. But if a vacuum persists, more familiar candidates could benefit from an explosion in campaign coverage and an apparent diminution in the attention paid to early caucuses and even primaries in unrepresentative states like Iowa and New Hampshire.
If Mr. Cuomo has not decided already, he and other prominent potential candidates may not have to until well beyond the summer. "He can wait longer than anybody in the field," said Thomas E. Donilon, a Democratic strategist.
"I'm suggesting you can wait pretty late in the year," said John A. Marino, whom Mr. Cuomo installed as chairman of the Democratic State Committee.
"I don't think he has to make a final decision until December," said David Garth, a Cuomo friend and political consultant.
As Governor of New York, Mr. Cuomo has visibility. Some of his campaign money could be applied to a Presidential race. He has consistently articulated a case against President Bush, whose popularity could erode because of the economy, his health or his running mate.
Doubts predominate, though, particularly about whether Mr. Cuomo would feel comfortable about running and whether he could govern and conduct a grueling campaign simultaneously. Yet even if a challenge looks like a lost cause, Mr. Cuomo once remarked that "there can be a nobility in facing an uphill struggle, even one that seems nearly impossible, but only if you feel good about yourself and what you're doing."
The Governor was feeling good the other day. "I am very good with ideas," he was saying. "There's no important domestic issue I haven't dealt with. I can also talk about foreign affairs -- free trade, China, most-favored-nation status. Do you know where Matilda and I just celebrated our anniversary? In Columbia County, at a Japanese restaurant."

Maxwell Fights Murdoch On a New Front: Coupons

BYLINE: By Alex S. Jones

 BODY:
WHILE The Daily News battles for survival on many fronts, the fight over coupons for such things as a 75-cent discount on a Jell-O cheesecake has become a major engagement that the New York paper has been losing.
The coupon fight is another front in the war between Robert Maxwell, the British publisher who owns The Daily News, and Rupert Murdoch. The two have competing newspapers in London, and Mr. Maxwell has started a new horse-racing paper, The Racing Times, to compete with The Daily Racing Form, which was until recently controlled by Mr. Murdoch.
Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation also owns Quad Marketing Inc. and Product Movers Inc., two of the three companies that produce the coupon booklets in many Sunday newspapers.
 Coupons are an important source of revenue for papers and attract readers. But all three coupon companies stopped placing coupons in The Daily News when its Sunday circulation fell sharply from 1.1 million in the five-month strike that ended in March, when Mr. Maxwell bought the paper.
The Daily News immediately started trying to woo advertisers back by guaranteeing that its audited Sunday circulation would average at least a million for the six months ending in September. A News spokesman said the paper was "on target," but declined to give numbers.
Thus far, however, none of the coupon booklets have returned to The Daily News, although they do appear Newsday and The New York Times.
Les Goodstein, vice president of advertising at The News, said the non-Murdoch coupon company, Valassis Inserts Inc., would begin placing its coupons in The News by mid-July. David A. Brandon, president of Valas sis, said a deal with The News was close, but not yet complete.
 Should Valassis coupons return toThe Daily News, the other two coupon companies may be under greater pressure from package-goods companies to go back as well.
 But Ken Bortner, president of Mr. Murdoch's News America Publishing, said its coupon booklets would not return to The News unless the rates came down drastically.
"If our coupons are to be used to build circulation, we should have an incentive to go back," he said. "If we just help Mr. Maxwell and not Mr. Murdoch, what's the point?"
At The Daily News, there is suspicion that the absence of the coupon books is not based on economics.
"Murdoch just does not want to do business with Maxwell; that's the end of the story," said a News executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.
But Mr. Goodstein said he remained "confident that at some point we'll get the business back."
And Mr. Bortner said, "Given the right structure and right terms, something could be worked out."
 
Editorial Feud Continues
For 15 years, readers of the editorial pages in Shreveport, La., have been able to choose between the conservative voice of The Times of Shreveport and the outspoken liberalism of The Shreveport Journal.
The Journal ceased publication in April, but its prickly editorial page has survived and appears Monday through Friday side-by-side with The Times's editorial page. On Saturday, The Times's op-ed page separates the feuding views, and Sunday belongs to The Times exclusively because The Journal did not publish on Sunday.
"As far as I know, this is unique," said Charles T. Beaird, the 68-year-old Shreveport native who has the right to express his liberal views in The Times until 2000.
Starting in 1953, The Times, owned by the Gannett Company, and The Journal were published in a joint operating arrangement in which they merged production, business and delivery operations and split the profits.
The Journal, the afternoon paper, lost money, so the much-larger Times said the arrangement would not be renewed when it expired in 1994. But The Journal owned the rights to the paper's press, a complication.
The compromise was to close The Shreveport Journal but continue the editorial page. And Mr. Beaird's family will also receive The Journal's roughly 20 percent share of The Times's profits until 1994.
 
Latest Bout for Trump
When it comes to negative press coverage, Donald J. Trump usually attacks. So the New York developer recently declared war on a Wall Street Journal reporter.
Norman Pearlstine, the executive editor, acknowledges that his reporter might have used better judgment -- and has second thoughts about a time when he accepted Mr. Trump's expensive hospitality.
But he expressed full confidence in Neil Barsky, who has been covering Mr. Trump for The Wall Street Journal since 1989, and said Mr. Barsky would continue on the Trump beat and would not be reprimanded.
On May 31, The Journal published an article by Mr. Barsky that said Mr. Trump's finances were was so strained that the developer might have to borrow money from his father.
 Mr. Trump denounced the article as untrue and charged that Mr. Barsky had asked for free tickets to the Holyfield-Foreman fight, staged by Mr. Trump in Atlantic City on April 19.
 Mr. Pearlstine said Mr. Trump told him that Mr. Barsky had been given three $1,000 tickets and then asked for two more tickets and a hotel suite, which were refused. Mr. Trump charged that Mr. Barsky was retaliating with his article.
Mr. Pearlstine said what happened was quite different. He said a Trump official offered a ticket to Mr. Barsky. The Journal's policy generally prohibits accepting gifts. Mr. Barsky asked Fred R. Bleakley, the news editor, whether he should accept.
Mr. Barsky wanted to go to the fight to gain access to top Trump executives. Mr. Bleakley did not express strong opposition, which he now regards as his mistake.
Mr. Barsky accepted the ticket, was invited to take two and agreed, so his brother could go. He paid $100 for a third ticket for his father, but when he went to pick up the two free tickets, he was offered a third $1,000 ticket for his father. He accepted.
But The Journal says there were no requests for two additional tickets or a free hotel suite.
Mr. Barsky said he probably should have refused the tickets. "I made a mistake, and it's a beaut," he said.
And Mr. Pearlstine said, "The fact that Donald chose to call and complain a month after the event rather than at the time suggests that he was seeking favorable coverage and is upset he didn't get it."
Mr. Pearlstine said he might have erred when he accepted Mr. Trump's invitation in 1988 to a helicopter ride to Atlantic City and free tickets for the Tyson-Holmes fight. He said he reasoned that the trip would enable him to meet valuable news sources. "If he offered the tickets today, I would not accept them," he said.
Mr. Trump said he was "strongly considering major legal action" against The Journal and Mr. Barsky.
But Mr. Pearlstine was skeptical that such a suit would ever be filed. He said The Journal had sent $3,000 to Mr. Trump for the tickets.

HEADLINE: Angola's New War;
As Battle Lines Form for Elections, Ruling Party Secures Grip on Power

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUANDA, Angola, June 9

 BODY:
It will long be debated who won and who lost Angola's 16-year civil war, but most diplomats and political experts here believe that as the nation prepares to hold its first free elections, the leftist Government has an edge in the coming campaign.
 The peace accord signed in Lisbon on May 31, culminating a year of talks involving Washington and Moscow as well as the warring factions, provides for elections in the second half of 1992. But the pact gives the Luanda Government sweeping powers in the interim, at least for the moment, say analysts examining the document's fine print. 
 For one thing, the accord says nothing about the legal framework for elections. Those details are to be worked out by a political and military commission made up of the Angolan Government, rebel representatives and representatives from the three mediating governments, the United States, the Soviet Union and Portugal, who are scheduled to hold their first meeting on June 17.
 
Ruling Party Holds On
 Jardo Mulekalia, the Washington representative of the Angolan rebel organization, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita, said in a telephone interview that Unita would insure that the Government would not hold sway over the voting arrangements.
"We will have our say about how the election will be run," the official said. "The Government's laws are not going to be the final word."
But until new electoral rules are hammered out -- a process that could take months -- the Luanda Government can make whatever rules it likes. And so far, the narrowly based, rigidly centralized ruling party has shown little inclination to loosen its grip.
Last week, during the seemingly endless round of parades and rallies staged by the Government to mark the end of the civil war, the ruling party, the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola, made sure its posters and slogans blanketed the city. Other groups were strongly discouraged from doing the same.
In fact, until the Government issues new press and political association rules -- and it seems in no rush to do so -- other groups are barred from even trying to canvass new members without its permission. "The Government's got a monopoly on power, and they're not going to give it up easily," said one observer.
 
Counting on Ethnic Loyalty
 Despite the restrictions, new centrist parties hoping to profit from popular disenchantment with the warring factions are sprouting almost daily. So far, at least 25 groups have sought recognition from the Government to participate in next year's elections. But for the moment they appear to be little known and without strong leadership.
"With a little time, these new groups could pose a challenge to the M.P.L.A and Unita, because there's a real yearning for an alternative," said one Western diplomat. "But right now, they're too green."
The most potent element in the contest, however, could be the enduring power of regional and ethnic loyalities. And in this realm, too, the ruling power appears to have an edge.
The presumed political base of the Unita leader, Jonas Savimbi, is the mostly rural and agrarian central highlands, the region dominated by his ethnic group, the Ovimbundu.
The ruling party, by contrast, draws its support mostly from Kimbundu people of Luanda, Angola's capital, and the nearby Cuanza Valley.
 
A Possible Swing Party
 If voting occurred along regional and ethnic lines, which is often the case in Africa, Mr. Savimbi and his supporters could get about 40 percent of the vote, mainly from the Ovimbundu. The People's Movement, analysts say, would probably win support from the Kimbundu and the Luanda-Chowde people in the northeast, who together form about 35 percent of the population.
Under such circumstances, choices made by a third major ethnic group, the Bakongo, concentrated in the northeast but also living in pockets along the Congo and Zaire borders, could prove decisive. The Bakongo group, significantly, was the ethnic base of the National Front for the Liberation of Angola, which fought against both the People's Movement and Unita during the bloody years following Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975.
For Angola's nearly nine million people, the voting process is the first peaceful struggle for power many have known. Before the civil war that claimed more than 300,000 lives erupted in November 1975, the country had experienced years of guerrilla warfare as nationalists demanded freedom from Portugal.
Last year Portugal, acting as a mediator, brought the United States-backed Unita and Soviet-backed People's Movement together for the first of what would be seven negotiating sessions ending in the cease-fire accord signed last month.
Holden Roberto, the former leader of the National Front, who now lives in Paris, recently signaled that he would return to Angola soon, but it was not certain what he intended to do.
Many of his followers have recently joined the ruling People's Movement. While Mr. Roberto is said to be still opposed to the other factions, political observers here believe the Bakongo are likely to vote in large numbers in favor of the People's Movement.
 
Skepticism Abounds
 An issue that could still hurt the ruling party, however, is its two decades of rigid adherence to Marxist-Leninist policies. Only last fall, in the wake of democratic changes sweeping Africa, did the party abandon Marxism and declare itself a social democratic force.
Since then, almost nothing once sacrosanct to the party leaders has been left untouched. Mention of Marxism is virtually taboo, and mention of the topic is met with insistent disavowals of the doctrine. Advocacy of free markets and of economic competition are now standard.
Although the Government's political offensive has had some success, judging by the crowds at its rallies last week, the overall effort seems to be mired in popular skepticism. Many Angolans seem unwilling to forgive the Government for the suffering brought on by years of repressive rule.
"The M.P.L.A. has still got a huge image problem here," said a teacher who spoke on condition of anonymity. "People don't trust overnight conversions."

HEADLINE: U.S. Gap In World Investing

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
Foreign investment in the United States exceeds American investment overseas by much more than most economists had previously believed, according to two new measurements released today by the Commerce Department.
The department's previous calculations of the nation's net investment position, which showed an even greater United States deficit than the new measures, had been widely discounted by many economists as outdated and badly understating the value of American investments overseas and of the Federal Government's holdings in gold. 
 While the earlier calculations, for example, indicated a deficit of more than $660 billion in American investment overseas in 1989, private economists were predicting that, if correctly calculated, the deficit would be less than $200 billion, and some suggested it might be non-existent.
 
At Least $281 Billion
 The Commerce Department took the criticisms into account in the new measures of international investment released today. Nonetheless, the figures showed that foreign investments in the United States still exceeded American investments overseas by at least $281 billion and possibly $464 billion in 1989, the latest year for which data were available.
Allan H. Young, the director of the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, said his statisticians had spent a year reviewing much more detailed information than the outside economists had been able to use.
The significance of the figures is hotly debated. Some economists contend that they simply show that the United States is a good place to invest and that international capital markets are functioning properly in sending money here.
But other economists and many politicians have warned that the nation's investment position shows that the United States is no longer competitive in world markets and has mortgaged its future to foreigners.
The department has traditionally used three different techniques for adding up United States investments abroad and foreign investments in the United States. Bonds, small stakes in companies and Federal Government holdings of foreign currencies were valued at current market prices. So-called direct investments -- which include land, factories, corporate subsidiaries and large stakes in companies -- were valued at their original purchase prices, even if they were bought many years ago. And year after year, the Federal Government's large holdings of gold were valued at just $42 an ounce.
Under the original-purchase-price measure, America's net investment position turned negative in 1984, when the value of foreign holdings in the United States based on their purchase price exceeded the similar value of United States holdings overseas by $2.2 billion. By 1989, the deficit by this measure had swelled to $663.7 billion.
 
No Appreciation Factor
 Economists outside the Commerce Department have long criticized these figures as erroneous and misleading. American companies made huge investments overseas in the 1960's and 70's that must have appreciated in value since then, they said, adding that large foreign direct investment in the United States is a comparatively recent phenomenon.
Yet the department's statistics would have counted a $10 million American purchase of a company in Tokyo 40 years ago, for example, the same as a $10 million Japanese purchase of a company in New York 4 years ago.
The Commerce Department addressed this problem in the revised measurements released today by valuing gold at the price prevailing at the end of each year and by following two different methods proposed by private economists for calculating direct investments.
One approach, known as a market-value calculation, multiplies American investments in foreign companies and subsidiaries by the appreciation in each foreign country's stock market since the investment was made. An international index of stock markets is used for small countries without their own well-developed stock markets.
This calculation produced a deficit of $281.4 billion in 1989, the most recent year available. Figures for 1990, using any system of calculations, will not be available until next month.
The Commerce Department's other new approach, known as a current-cost calculation, values investments in land, factories and other tangible assets at current prices. The department assumed that land appreciated at the same rate as overall prices in each economy, a technique that the department's statisticians acknowledged might underestimate the actual appreciation.
Taking this depreciation into account and factoring in exchange-rate fluctuations, the net United States investment deficit was $463.9 billion.
 
A 'Trivial' Gap
 Robert Eisner, the William R. Kenan Professor of Economics at Northwestern University and a former president of the American Economic Association, said that this deficit was too small to be meaningful.
"Whether it's $800 billion, $600 billion or $400 billion is trivial compared to a national wealth of $20, $30 or $40 trillion, depending on how you measure it," he said.
Even if the deficit is large and widening, Professor Eisner said, it may not be important. The extra annual interest and earnings payments leaving the United States will tend to exceed incoming interest and earnings payments by only a few billion dollars, a tiny amount in a nearly $6 trillion economy, he said.
It is also not entirely accurate to refer to the United States as a net debtor nation, Professor Eisner said, because little of the foreign investment in the United States has taken the form of outright loans, as opposed to investments in United States stock, land and factories.
If foreigners wanted to sell these assets quickly, Professor Eisner said, the value of the dollar would fall and the value of American investments overseas, valued in other currencies, would rise. Thus, he added, the nation's net investment position would come back into balance.
Some politicians have expressed concern that the United States may have mortgaged its future by becoming a net debtor nation.
"The figures confirm that the U.S. has become a major international debtor," Senator Max S. Baucus, Democrat of Montana, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on International Trade, said today in a statement. "There is no denying that the net creditor/debtor position of the U.S. has slipped dramatically in the last 10 years."

HEADLINE: For Young Theatrical Experiment, Two Down and How Many to Go?

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
When "Our Country's Good" closed on Saturday night at the Nederlander Theater, a little more than a month after the play about 18th-century Australian convicts opened, it marked the second flop in two tries for the Broadway Alliance, the plan set up last year to encourage the production of more serious plays and the growth of new audiences by reducing both costs and ticket prices.
And while many theater people say it is much too soon to pass final judgment on the alliance, most of them add that changes must be made to improve its chances of success. 
 Those changes, they say, include increasing the strict limits on budgets for production and advertising and raising ticket prices to the level of Off Broadway. In addition, they say, producers of an alliance play that becomes a hit should be allowed to switch it to a potentially more lucrative full Broadway contract, raise ticket prices to standard Broadway levels and move it to a more glamorous Broadway house.
"It's basically a wonderful idea to produce shows on Broadway and make them available to the public under Off Broadway conditions at theaters that would otherwise be unoccupied," said Bernard B. Jacobs, president of the Shubert Organization, Broadway's largest theater owner, describing the alliance's policy up to now. "But the conditions have to be altered and made more realistic."
 
$400,000 Top Cost
 Under terms of the alliance plan agreed to last year by a coalition of Broadway producers, theater owners, craft guilds and unions, the plays must be produced for no more than $400,000 instead of the $800,000 to $1 million the average serious play costs these days.
Royalties, many salaries and other costs for alliance plays are cut by an average of at least 25 percent. Ticket prices range from $10 or $12 to a maximum of $24, compared with the present nonmusical top on Broadway of about $40 to $45 and the Off Broadway ticket price of about $30. The producer is not allowed to change to a full Broadway contract, increase prices or take the play to a bigger theater.
Frank and Woji Gero, co-producers of "Our Country's Good," said that a realistic budget figure would be $500,000 and that a realistic ticket price would be about $30.
"We were longing to use a slogan like 'Broadway at Off Broadway prices," Ms. Gero said, "but we couldn't because our prices were cheaper than Off Broadway. We think they should match Off Broadway."
Increasing the budget and raising the ticket prices would also provide more money for advertising and marketing. "I think you have to allow a little more room to advertise and promote the show," said Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters, who is a major supporter of the alliance. "Right now it's on a bit of a starvation diet."
 
Need for Advertising
 Mr. Jacobs said that "if a show gets rave reviews, there's no way to tell the public, because you don't have the advertising budget for it." He added that the producer should also have the incentive of being able to make more money from a hit by making it a regular Broadway attraction.
Under the alliance, each of the three major Broadway theater owners -- Shubert, Jujamcyn and the Nederlander Organization -- designates one of its theaters for alliance plays. Mr. Jacobs said he thought the plan should be expanded to include more of the theaters that are frequently dark.
Mr. Landesman said he hoped that "the unions, particularly Actors' Equity, which has had the most rigid attitude toward the alliance, will be open and accommodating and figure out what adjustments to make in the structure to make it work better."
But Alan Eisenberg, executive secretary of Actors' Equity and chairman of the alliance committee, which is to meet later this month, said he thought talk about change was "premature."
"The whole point of this was to do small plays, with small casts and one set," Mr. Eisenberg said. "Let's not lose sight of what this is about. 'Our Country's Good' should not have been done under the alliance. It was too big. It had too many actors." The play has a cast of 10.
 
Economics of Reality
 Some theater people say privately that the alliance plan, which is to expire in February, has never made sense, that it doesn't take into account the reality of Broadway economics. The only plays that will be done under the alliance, they say, are ones for which producers would have trouble raising money under any circumstances, plays with very limited chances of success.
They say it is doubtful whether the public will pay to see a serious drama on Broadway at any price if it has no big-name star. And if the play has a major star, or a star playwright like Neil Simon, the producer would have no interest in the alliance, they add. So if a typical Broadway play has about a 60 percent chance of success, they conclude, an alliance play's hopes are 20 percent, and the spending limitations make things even worse.
In addition, some theater people have questioned whether the reduced prices make potential theatergoers think they are being sold damaged goods.
But the alliance's supporters disagree. All they need, they say, is a hit.
"Having two failures doesn't help," Mr. Gero said. "But there's nothing wrong with the alliance that a hit won't solve."
Mr. Landesman said that both the first alliance play -- "The Speed of Darkness" by Steve Tesich, which closed in March after only 36 performances -- and "Our Country's Good," by the little-known playwright Timberlake Wertenbaker, would have had "problematic runs" even if they had been done Off Broadway.
"All the Broadway Alliance needs is plays that people want to see," he said. "I think the biggest mistake would be to write the alliance off because it started with a couple of plays that didn't work."
Mr. Eisenberg noted that both plays received only middling reviews. "A play that's received well by the critics will be the test of whether this works or not," he said.
Now the alliance awaits the fall season and its next play, hoping it will fare better. Jane Slotin, plan manager for the alliance, said that the producers of one play would soon announce their intentions to open it in the fall.
And the Geros say they, too, are planning to bring in a new American play under the alliance in October or November. Yes, they acknowledge, "Our Country's Good" was a financial failure. "But we got six Tony nominations," Ms. Gero said. "So maybe we've helped the alliance take a few baby steps forward."

HEADLINE: Report Critical of Drop in Savings

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 9

 BODY:
Criticizing the United States in particular, the coordinating bank for the world's central banks said today that long-term economic growth in the industrial world was slipping because of a sharp drop in savings as well as a decline in public investment by many governments.
In a report issued today, the Bank for International Settlements said the drop in savings -- which provides the money for investment for future growth -- could also hurt Eastern Europe and the third world because they need to attract investment money to spur their economies. 
 The bank, which is often called the central bankers' central bank, said the budget deficits in the United States and many other countries are the main reason for the decline in savings. The bank said the imbalance between the supply of savings and the demand for investment money has created a capital shortage that has pushed real interest rates to near-record levels.
"The high level of real long-term interest rates in virtually all countries is widely seen as a reflection of such a shortage," said the bank, which is based in Basel, Switzerland.
The bank's annual report added that many governments, but most notably the United States Government, are also undermining economic growth by curtailing investment in core public infrastructure, like roads and public transportation. The report said empirical evidence showed a link between such investment and the rate of economic growth.
"A deterioration in infrastructure over the past decade is clearly evident in the United States, where the problem is concentrated in major cities," said the bank, which is known more for conservative views than Keynesian ones. "Decisions on government spending priorities must take account of the growth-enhancing aspects of appropriate public investment."
 
Drop in Public Investment
 The report stated that net public investment in the United States, for projects like roads, bridges and airports, has dropped to one-quarter of 1 percent of total economic output, by far the lowest of all major industrial nations. In Japan, net public investment is 5.7 percent of output, and in Germany, 3.7 percent.
"Regions investing more in infrastructure," the bank stated, "tend to have higher output, productivity and employment growth. Public investment often stimulates output growth by providing a base on which private investment can build."
The report said an increase in national saving was important not just to spur growth but to help relieve pressures expected to arise from a projected long-term increase in the proportion of the elderly in the indusrial world.
 
Low U.S. Savings Rate
 "The decline in national saving may be an important factor in the slower improvement in living standards in a number of industrial countries," the bank said.
The bank noted that net national saving in the United States dropped from 10.8 percent of gross national product in the 1960's to 4 percent in the 1980's. That compares with a 20.9 percent rate in Japan in the 80's, and an 11.6 percent rate in what had been West Germany.
Some economists have argued that the drop in national saving is a result, not a cause, of slower economic growth. But the bank, backing the argument that low savings rates cause low growth, noted that in the 1980's Japan had the highest savings rate and highest real wage growth rate of the major industrial countries. In contrast, the United States had the lowest savings rate and lowest growth in real wages.
 
Constraints on Growth
 The bank noted that the industrial world's recent economic slowdown has helped raise the savings rate. But it added that "the longer-term decline in national saving in many countries remains a constraint on capital investment and, ultimately, growth in the world economy."
The report said that in the short term, Eastern Europe and the developing world will not make significant demands on Western capital because Western corporations and banks will not find them an attractive place to invest. But if the reform process is successful in Eastern Europe, the report said, a much greater strain on the West's savings could result.
The bank noted that net saving among the major industrial countries dropped to 10 percent of gross national product in the 1980's, from 13.5 percent in the 60's. Almost all the drop was caused by a decline in government saving, rather than in private saving. The bank's report noted that the United States, France, Britain, Italy and Canada all went from budget surpluses in the 1960's to deficits in the 80's.
The bank did not call for immediate moves to slash budget deficits, recognizing that this could worsen the current economic slowdown. Instead, it said deficit-cutting efforts "in the industrial countries should be reinforced, particularly once an upturn in economic activity allows greater flexibility in the design of fiscal policy."

HEADLINE: As Candidates Wait to Run, Cash Waits to Follow

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
No prospective Presidential candidate has yet come calling on E. William Crotty, a leading Democratic fund-raiser, and that says a lot about the changed role of money as the 1992 Presidential campaign draws near.
By this time four years ago, five Presidential contenders had made separate visits to Mr. Crotty's home in Daytona Beach, Fla., soliciting his help. 
 But unlike the 1988 campaign, when the major Democratic candidates had already established fund-raising organizations that had collected at least $15 million altogether, the money race this year has not even been joined.
"I don't know any of my friends who have been asked to make a particular commitment," said Mr. Crotty, who eventually went with Senator Al Gore of Tennessee in 1988. "And it's getting late."
 
On the Sidelines
 With potential candidates unusually hesitant to dive into a race against a popular incumbent and with many longtime donors sapped by the sluggish economy, Democrats who raise money are on the sidelines. The lack of activity is certain to significantly alter the dynamics of the primary season as compared with the last two Presidential campaigns, and will undoubtedly affect who captures the Democratic nomination.
Four years ago, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts catapulted into the top tier of candidates in large part because he had established credibility by amassing huge sums of money very early. But since there is no comparable situation this year, candidates may be left hoping that lightning strikes them politically so the donations start pouring in. By the end of 1987, Mr. Dukakis had collected $10.6 million; Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri $4.4 million and Mr. Gore and Senator Paul Simon of Illinois $3.8 million apiece.
"Politics will drive the money," said Duane B. Garrett, a San Francisco fund-raiser, "rather than a Dukakis example, where money helped drive politics."
It is generally assumed that candidates will need to raise at least $6 million by the end of this year to prepare for the early contests -- the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary are in February -- and qualify for Federal matching funds. Many analysts argue that this compressed political season benefits the best-known entrants with highly developed fund-raising networks who can enter the race late and draw contributions quickly. On the other hand, lesser-known candidates, struggling to raise dollar after dollar, may find themselves shut out.
As evidence of the dearth of fund-raising, Impac, a group of major Democratic fund-raisers in 1988, is holding its first meeting of the year on Tuesday, a session that will be attended by several possible candidates. In an invitation to members, Nathan Landow, the head of Impac, conceded there is so little interest in the Presidential field that the group may disband.
"This may be our only meeting during the '92 election cycle," Mr. Landow wrote. "If for no other reason, let's do it for old time's sake. Who knows, maybe we'll learn something about our party's future of which we are presently unaware."
 
A Retreat in Virginia
 In another effort to get fund-raisers more involved, the Democratic Party is holding a retreat next week in Leesburg, Va., with several top fund-raisers, potential candidates and other party leaders to devise strategy for the 1992 general election campaign.
"The whole conventional wisdom about the system forcing candidates to gear up fund-raising early can now be disputed," said Herbert E. Alexander, an authority on Presidential campaign finance at the University of Southern California. "The race may be competitive on the basis of crash fund-raising at the end of the season."
Republicans have no such worries because President Bush can easily tap his network of supporters and raise as much as he needs for the primary season. But without a serious challenger expected for the nominations, Mr. Bush has no great need for money. Candidates who make it to the general election can count on public subsidies to finance their races.
The Democrat whom most fund-raisers cite as being best-positioned to raise large sums of money quickly is Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, who insists he has no plans to run. Mr. Cuomo is in an enviable position because he is well known nationally and is the leading officeholder in a large state filled with potential donors.
 
When Experience Counts
 Others who could be well-positioned financially should they decide to run are those who have sought national office before and thus are well known and already have fund-raising networks: Senator Gore, Representative Gephardt, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Gore have quietly taken some fund-raising trips, but they deny that the money is for Presidential drives.
These other possible candidates are not as well poised because they have not previously sought national office: Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia could tap sizable contributions in state as a sitting Governor. Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia is well known nationally but his fund-raising ability is largely unproven, though he could forgo Federal matching funds and use his personal wealth to finance a race.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa has built up a list of liberal donors across the county. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas benefits from sitting in office and has begun to develop a core of possible donors nationwide as chairman of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council.
The one candidate who has been most aggressively holding fund-raising events in several states is the only one who has officially announced: former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts.
 
'The Only Game in Town'
 The Tsongas campaign's chief fund-raiser, Nicholas A. Rizzo, said he hopes to have raised $400,000 to $500,000 by the end of June to keep the organization running and out of debt. But he said the task was difficult because Mr. Tsongas has been out of office for seven years, and because the lack of competition has led to little interest in the race.
"We're the only game in town, and that's nice," Mr. Rizzo said. "But it's a double-edged sword. Without competition, there's nothing to compare Tsongas to, and that fact does not stimulate interest. When others enter the race, it will hopefully raise the level of fund-raising because people will have a reason to give."
Mr. Garrett, the San Francisco fund-raiser, agrees that the second-tier candidates are put "in the traditional niche of having to score well early to get the funds to continue on. The last person who was really successful with that formula was George McGovern in 1972." He added, "All of the less-known candidates are vulnerable to the sudden entry of a Gore, Cuomo or Gephardt -- a nationally known candidate with a major fund-raising base."
One who takes issue with the idea that less-known candidates will be at a disadvantage is Robert A. Farmer, the treasurer of the Democratic National Committee who was the chief fund-raiser for the Dukakis campaign, which had raised about $4 million by this time four years ago.
"A lot of people think that a late start helps the guys who can raise a lot of money," he said. "I think it hurts the guys who can raise a lot of money. It means money will be less of a factor than it was before. A lot of people have the ability to raise $3 million."

HEADLINE: Flooding Turns Farmland Into Pools of Trouble

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLARION, Iowa, June 8

 BODY:
In his 58 years of farming here, Henry Delger has never seen so much storm water covering the fields and drenching the spirits and hopes of so many of his neighbors. With a sad, slow shake of his head, he said the heavy rains that have hit the Midwest in recent weeks had made "grown men cry."
"I can believe it," Mr. Delger's friend, Robert Robb, said as the two men sat and talked the other day at a grain elevator in this farm town of 3,000 in north-central Iowa. 
 "There are acres and acres of ponds out there where corn should be," Mr. Delger said. "People can't even get into their fields to plant. A lot of them are going to go broke."
This has been one of Iowa's wettest springs ever, flooding basements and streets, overflowing riverbanks and soaking millions of acres of rich farmland.
 
350 Percent Wetter Than Usual
 In Hamilton County, north of Des Moines, rainfall was reported to be 350 percent of normal levels.
"In May our field turned into a lake," said Ruth E. Book, an administrator at Iowa State University and a farmer's wife. "We put a boat on it and went boating. We tried to decide whether to stock it with fish or wait and see if we could plant."
The rains have greatly delayed planting in 44 of Iowa's 99 counties, largely in the north-central part of the state, where some farmers are up to a month or more behind their normal corn planting schedule.
The delay could cut the harvest in some of those counties by 30 percent and push farmers who barely survived the hard times that swept rural America in the 1980's off the land.
Last week, Gov. Terry E. Branstad asked the Federal Government to designate the 44 counties as disaster areas and to ease and extend farm and price protection programs.
 
Many Unscathed
 Like a tornado that demolishes one house and leaves its neighbor standing, the rains have caused few problems for most of the state's farmers. Over all, nearly 90 percent of the corn crop and most of soybeans have been planted, and Iowa is expecting a good fall harvest. But it is not yet clear what effect this spring's weather will have on the prices that farmers get for the crops or that consumers pay for their food.
This has been an unusually wet spring throughout the Midwestern farm belt, but except for north-central Iowa and south-central Minnesota, the flooding has not been severe enough to have a major impact on farming.
"Somehow when the hurt is spread around it's different," said Garren O. Benson, an agronomist at Iowa State University in Ames. "But this time the hurt is concentrated. And there's no question that some farmers in the hardest-hit areas will go out of business."
The rains have also delayed spring planting in several counties in southern Minnesota, and Gov. Arne Carlson is seeking Federal help for farmers in at least eight counties there.
A spokesman for Governor Carlson, Tim Droogsma, said, "There have been a lot of sleepless nights for some of these guys."
He added: "Farming is a tricky business. You're at the mercy of so many things. The weather. Financial markets. International events."
Corn should be planted by early May. According to crop experts at Iowa State University, yields decline by 16 percent if planting is delayed until June 1, by 29 percent if the planting is not finished by June 10 and by 45 percent if the planting drags on until June 20.
 
Paying for Idle Tractor
 "It's disastrous for the individual farmer if all of a sudden you lose 30, 40 percent of your crop," Mr. Droogsma said. "Your income is slashed but your overhead isn't. You still have debt payments. You still have to pay for that tractor sitting out there in the rain."
A few recent days of sunshine have helped the farmers in both states, but the fields are still so wet around Clarion, in Wright County, that tractors and other equipment are at risk of getting stuck in the mud.
"The people who pull them out, that's been a good business to be in," Mr. Benson said. "Ironically, much of the same area was dry in 1988 and '89 when we had a problem with drought."
With the break in the weather, farmers have been working well into the night, trying to dry their fields by plowing before planting. Often, they have been forced to plow in uneven rows as they steer around "wet holes" and large patches of mud scattered in low spots.
At the Clarion Farmers Elevator Cooperative, Al Struthers, the manager, walked in and brushed the feed dust off his jeans. He said he did not usually work outside his office but business has been so slow because of the rain that he had been busying himself with chores around the elevator. He figures the cooperative will lose several hundred thousand dollars.
Mr. Struthers said the average rainfall for the area is 34 inches for a full year, but so far this spring 24 inches have fallen.
"There's a lot of stress," he said. "We're all tied to the farm economy around here. If the farmers don't make money, the hardware store suffers and the feed store and on and on. We were coming back from the depression of the 80's quite well and then this hit."
Twenty miles north, Harold Trask was reluctant to leave his fields "because I don't want to waste a minute drying them out."
Mr. Trask has been farming for 21 of his 44 years. One night, about 10 days ago, when the rains were heavy, he sat at his window and watched the water pour from the sky.
"I wasn't crying," he said. "But tears were running down my face."
Still, Mr. Trask is one of the lucky ones in Wright County. He also raises hogs, so does not depend entirely on corn and soybeans as do about 75 percent of his neighbors.
His windswept face shows his worry. "We're a month late around here," he said. "It means no profit. It means being barely able to hold the farm together for another year."
He drove down a gravel road, pointing out dozens of wet holes and weed-choked patches of mud. He walked across a field, water oozing from the black soil after each step.
"We shouldn't be trying to work these fields when they're so wet," he said. "But we're desperate. Honest to God, we just don't know what to do. But we might be O.K. if this weather holds."
The forecast for Monday calls for rain.

HEADLINE: Homeownership At Record Level For New Yorkers

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
While New York City is still primarily a tenant's town, the surge of co-op conversions and housing construction in the 1980's brought the level of homeownership above 25 percent for the first time, according to figures in the 1990 census.
It is a truism of American life that people who own their homes think and act differently from renters, and a variety of political leaders and others expect the increase -- from 23.4 percent of households in 1980 to 28.4 percent in 1990 -- to be reflected in areas from career mobility to political affiliation. 
 Most expect the rise in homeownership to be a bulwark against the flight of middle-class and affluent residents from the city, and to lead to pressure to hold down municipal taxes and spending. Even though homeowners remain vastly outnumbered, the recent purchasers are beginning to organize on the grass-roots level and think of themselves as a group.
"It has taken a while to realize that the landlord is us," said Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives, the largest among a growing number of homeowner groups, with 1,550 member co-op and condominium buildings.
"We spent the 80's consciousness-raising, not getting organized as a voting bloc," she added. "Now that needs to be done."
For other new homeowners, the change from renting has meant a broader change in perspective. "You see yourself and the city in longer terms," said Gail Wiese, who purchased her Brooklyn Heights apartment when her building was converted into a co-op in 1986. Since then, she has been elected to her co-op board and has begun to attend Community Board meetings. "As an owner, I have more responsibility," she said.
The potential impact of such activism has not escaped the notice of politicians, including Ruth Messinger, the Borough President of Manhattan, which gained 73,993 homeowners in the 1980's, more than any other borough. "We still have very legitimate concerns about the status of renters, but a growing number of people who own their homes will have somewhat different interests," she said.
The census report, release last month, shows that the number of homeowners in the city rose from 652,000 in 1980 to 807,000 in 1990.
The report confirms other studies by the city and state showing that the biggest surge came in ownership of apartments, both co-ops and condominiums, in new buildings as well as those converted from rentals. Construction and conversion reached a peak between 1984 and 1988, then ground to a virtual standstill as the city's economy slumped in the wake of the 1987 stock market collapse.
The ranks of new homeowners include many who now feel trapped in their homes. Though the wave of conversions helped thousands of New Yorkers move from tenancy to ownership at low insider prices, thousands more who bought apartments late in the decade paid more than the homes would now fetch in a slumping market.
 
A Stake in the City
 But what is bad for homeowners may be good for the city: those who cannot sell their homes without taking a loss are not inclined to move. The result, some economists maintain, is a larger, more stable middle class with a greater stake in New York's future.
"The simple fact of homeownership does not mean people will put up with severe deprivation in their quality of life, but it does have a stabilizing influence," said Kathy Wylde, vice president of the New York City Housing Partnership. "It means people are committed to the city."
Social scientists who have studied the behavior of homeowners elsewhere in the country say they are more likely to vote, join civic groups and volunteer for community projects than renters. Homeowners also tend to vote their pocketbooks, studies have shown, favoring low property taxes and zoning and development policies that preserve property values.
That pattern may not be as clear-cut in New York. One reason is that many of the city's renters -- particularly those with rent-regulated apartments -- are politically engaged and consider themselves just as committed to New York as owners. And because of the hectic schedules of many of the city's professionals, those who can afford to own apartments often have little time to become more involved in politics or community projects.
"Manhattan co-op and condo owners are busy people -- they tend to keep to themselves," said George Levitt, a bank executive who purchased a condominium on East 80th Street with his wife, Susan, in 1989, and has been attempting to organize other owners to lobby for property-tax relief.
 
Poorer Areas Affected
 Still, many New Yorkers who purchased apartments in the 1980's say they are more interested in neighborhood affairs, keep themselves better informed about city politics, and feel that they have a longer-term stake in the city than they did as renters.
While most of the increase in homeownership came in middle- and upper-income neighborhoods, it also occurred in poor areas that had been in rapid decline in the 1960's and 1970's.
Using government subsidies -- and in some cases city-owned land and buildings acquired almost for nothing -- housing groups have sold more than 10,000 homes since the mid-1980's in Harlem, the South Bronx, the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, and elsewhere. They have been purchased mainly by families in the city's swelling minority middle class.
"These are the very people who could leave the neighborhood if they want to, and we want them to stay," said Joseph E. Holley, director of the Northeast Brooklyn Housing Development Corporation.
The Census Bureau said the surge in homeownership came after 30 years when the balance of New York City renters and homeowners showed little change. It said the level of homeownership declined slightly during the 1970's, from 23.6 percent in 1970 to 23.4 percent in 1980, after rising gradually from 21.8 percent in 1960, 19.1 percent in 1950 and 14.3 percent in 1940.
According to the city's Finance Department, there are now 503,647 apartments in co-ops and condominiums in the city. The city's data, however, do not distinquish between apartments that are owner-occupied and those occupied by renters.
The surge of co-op and condominium construction and conversion is best reflected in records kept by the Real Estate Finance Bureau of the New York State Attorney General, which reviews plans from developers and sponsors.
The bureau said the peak growth year was 1986, when it accepted plans for 765 new buildings and conversions, with 52,800 apartments. By last year, it said, the pace had slowed drastically, with plans accepted for 288 new buildings and conversions, with 21,261 units.
This year, conversions and construction have all but ceased. Frederick K. Mehlman, an assistant attorney general, said only one plan for a co-op or condominium building had been submitted in each of the last two months.
Still, he said, when the city's economy strengthens, "there are a lot of landlords out there that still would like to convert their buildings."
 
Problems for Many Co-ops
 The surge of co-op conversions followed by an economic slump has left big problems for shareholders in hundreds of converted buildings where sponsors are in default on maintenance charges, taxes and other obligations.
Co-op owners have formed a number of groups in an effort to deal with the default problems, and some of those organizations are also broadening their focus to include issues like taxation. Apartment owners are forming alliances with landlords to fight the Dinkins administration's proposed sharp increase in real-estate taxes.
 
Concern Over Taxes
 Landlords and apartment owners share a concern over property taxes because they are taxed as a single, separate class of property owners, receiving less favorable treatment than owners of one- to three-family homes.
"The City Council has got to be very aware of the concerns of this constituency," said Debra Beck, vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York, which represents builders, landlords and others in the real-estate industry.
Some say the interests of co-op and condominium owners can be expected eventually to conflict with those of renters. Real-estate executives and some co-op owners assert that rent-regulation laws protecting tenants have have contributed to the problems of co-op defaults.

COMPANIES
Apple executives will visit I.B.M. today to discuss technology links, industry executives say. One proposal is for I.B.M. to license from Apple, and perhaps to help develop, software for a new line of Apple computers to succeed the Macintosh. Another possibility is that Apple will seek to use an I.B.M. microprocessor. [Page A1.]
Microsoft plans to introduce an improved version of its most popular software -- the DOS operating system. Some industry analysts say the company could profit enormously because tens of millions of personal computers already use older versions of DOS. The new system is also aimed at more powerful computers. [D1.] 
 Investors with about $200 million in Trammell Crow Equity Partners, a real estate investment fund, will be told today why their returns will be closer to 5 percent than the 15 to 20 percent they were promised. Part of the problem is that the fund suffers from some of the same conditions as the properties it bought. [D1.]
Goodyear's new chairman, Stanley C. Gault, wants to trim costs, increase profitability and refocus the troubled company on its core business: tires. By the end of Friday, his second day on the job, Mr. Gault was calling in his executives for daylong meetings. [D1.]
Rising costs, lower consumption and increased regulation and taxation are causing many who bought wineries in the 1970's to reconsider their investments. [D1.]
 
THE ECONOMY
The surge of co-op conversions and housing construction in New York in the 1980's brought the level of home ownership in the city above 25 percent for the first time, new Census figures show. [A1.]
Foreign investment in the United States exceeds American investment overseas by much more than most economists believed, new Commerce Department figures show. [D1.]
The Food and Drug Administration will review hundreds of product-safety measures it has proposed in the last 30 years but never issued. Among them are rules for the size of type on drug packaging and standards for heart-defibrillator machines. [A15.]
 
INTERNATIONAL
Long-term economic growth in the industrial world is slipping because of a sharp drop in savings and a decline in public investment, the Bank for International Settlements said. The bank, which acts as a central bank for central banks, was particularly critical of the United States and its reduced spending on its infrastructure of roads, bridges and the like. [D2.]
 
MEDIA BUSINESS
Since the departure of Thomas Hoving as editor in chief of Connoisseur in January, the magazine has changed noticeably. [D10.]
Two of the advertisers that Robert Maxwell, the publisher of The Daily News, is trying to entice to return to the paper are owned by Rupert Murdoch, his longtime media rival. [D10.]
After a decade at Howard J. Rubenstein Associates, Dan Klores, the New York public relations industry's premier stunt man, is striking out on his own. [D10.]

HEADLINE: Arms Talks: A Warm-Up

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
Although the Soviet and American Foreign Ministers have been meeting almost weekly to try to tie up long-delayed arms control agreements, the real focus of relations between Moscow and Washington has radically shifted to economics and the question of how the West can help transform Soviet society.
Don't be fooled by the recent attention that Washington and Moscow have been paying to arms control, both Soviet and American officials say. They are the wave of the past. The reason for the recent burst of arms control activity is that the Soviets are eager to get the conventional and nuclear agreements out of the way -- because Washington has made this a condition for a summit meeting that would focus primarily on economic help -- and Washington is eager to exploit Moscow's vulnerability. 
 Indeed, the joke making the rounds as Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, were meeting in Geneva last week was that Washington should simply offer to buy all of the Soviet Union's nuclear missiles, and thereby simultaneously bring the nuclear arms reduction talks to a conclusion and help Moscow solve its economic problems.
"The whole focus of the relationship is shifting," an Administration Soviet expert said. "Even though Baker is dashing off to Geneva to deal with arms control, issues like that, which dominated the agenda in the '70's and '80's, are taking a back seat to economics. The real discussions will be about what is going on inside the Soviet Union."
In the last two weeks alone the State Department's Soviet desk has played host to representatives of the Soviet Democratic Russian Party, members of the Azari Popular Front, Armenian politicians and businessmen, the foreign minister of the Republic of Georgia, Baltic leaders, and members of the Supreme Soviet. None of them came to talk about arms control. They want to establish their own direct contacts with Washington, they want economic and political advice, and they want money.
But while the focus of the relationship is shifting, it is not doing so overnight, and that explains in part why it took months to tie up the conventional arms treaty and why it could take several more to finish the strategic arms reduction treaty, even though both sides seem to want it out of the way.
 
Gorbachev's Juggling Act
 The transformation of the relationship, American and Soviet experts explain, is being driven first and foremost by the revolution inside the Soviet Union, in which Mr. Gorbachev is required to juggle various coalitions, prompting radical policy zigs and zags. Last fall, when Mr. Gorbachev was cracking down in the Baltics and leaning on conservatives, the army and the K.G.B. for support, the relationship with the West noticeably cooled. The whole subject of Western economic help for Mr. Gorbachev was put on a back burner.
Now that Mr. Gorbachev is more desperate for help, and has apparently concluded that the hard-liners have little to offer and that the reformers are an increasingly potent political force, he has lurched in the other direction, asking the seven major industrialized democracies for an invitation to their July summit meeting in London, sending Soviet economic experts to appeal to President Bush and squeezing his own military to drop its objections to the conventional arms treaty.
But the Soviet leader cannot just snap his fingers and get his military to give in to all the American demands in the strategic arms talks, even though it might speed up a summit meeting. He still has to juggle, because he may need to lean on the military again soon if there is economic chaos.
"I think if you were alive in 1917 things would have looked just as confusing," said one Baker aide. "In retrospect all of the changes look clear and in one direction. But this is what it looks like when you are in the middle of a revolution."
The zigs and zags on the Soviet side are both matched by, and reinforce, similarly ambiguous behavior from the Bush Administration. The Administration is justifiably uncertain and dubious about how far Mr. Gorbachev is really ready to go, but in the past it has also demonstrated a certain inability to fully grasp the extent of the transformation taking place in the Soviet Union and how it can be influenced by the West.
The Bush Administration, after nearly three years, has established a consistent pattern in responding to changes in the Eastern bloc: it rarely catches the first train, but it rarely misses the last one.
Until recently, Mr. Bush was very passive about pressing his own bureaucracy to break the deadlock in the strategic arms negotiations, because of reservations from conservatives about aspects of the treaty. Six months ago, leading American Sovietologists were predicting that Mr. Gorbachev might not last until spring. Today, the emphasis has changed to how to support him and his programs. One day Mr. Bush signals he doesn't want Mr. Gorbachev at the London economic summit, then he reluctantly accepts, after pressure from the Germans, British and French. Up to now the Administration has been much more clear about what it won't do -- give the Soviets piles of money -- than what it will do if they institute free-market changes.
"Such passivity is curious, if not dangerous, on a matter that has such profound implications for the future security of the United States," Robert D. Blackwill and Graham Allison, two experts on American-Soviet relations, write in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs. "Having spent some $5 trillion to meet the military challenge of the Soviet Union around the globe, is the United States to opt out now when the Soviet future is being formed?"
The mindset within the Bush Administration on this issue, though, is evolving month by month, as clearly indicated by the appointment of a lawyer, businessman and arch-capitalist, Robert S. Strauss, as the next ambassador to Moscow, replacing Jack F. Matlock Jr., a career Sovietologist.
American officials say that if a summit is to be held this summer between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev, it will serve as a fulcrum to force the Administration to address exactly how it intends to approach the question of helping to transform the Soviet Union.
 
'Step-by-Step Process'
 At the Copenhagen NATO summit meeting, Mr. Baker alluded to this when he told the Western allies: "We are developing a package of supportive measures, which we hope to coordinate with you and others. But I honestly don't think we can catalyze Soviet reform through a big bang approach. Our effort is more likely to be a step-by-step process."
American officials won't say what exactly will be in this package -- in part because they don't know themselves. But officials talk about programs to help the Soviets tap their oil reserves, to coordinate all the worldwide grants and credits already going to the Soviet Union and to provide advice on economic distribution.
But many of these ideas were first floated around the time of the Malta summit almost two years ago. There is still no consensus within the Administration for a program that would go much further. It does not necessarily have to involve piles of money, but it will probably have to be something more far-reaching than "technical advice," so that reformers within the Soviet Union can use it to help convince conservatives that the free market is both the right way to go and can be achieved without the mammoth social explosion that Mr. Gorbachev has begun to warn about.

HEADLINE: A Tourist and a Dispatcher Are Killed by Stray Gunfire

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
A woman from London who was visiting New York and a car dispatcher from Brooklyn were struck by stray gunfire in separate shootings Saturday night. They died hours apart in the same hospital.
The London woman, Yvonne Williams, a 30-year-old mother of five, was walking about 10:45 P.M. in the vicinity of 101st Street and Northern Boulevard in Corona, Queens, on her way to visit friends when she was hit in the lower back by a bullet fired by someone in a street dispute, the police said. 
 The dispatcher, Nelda Caraballo, 37, of 71 Nostrand Avenue in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, a mother of three, was working at the Borinquen Car Service, 826 Flushing Avenue in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, when she heard gunfire at 11:37 P.M., the police said. She stood up to see what was happening and a bullet struck her in the chest. An unidentified 9-year-old boy and a 22-year-old man sitting in a private car nearby were seriously wounded. The motive in the shooting is under investigation.
Both victims died at the City Hospital Center at Elmhurst.
 
Seven Shot in Brooklyn
 In a third shooting Saturday night, seven people were shot, five of them by stray gunfire, in a street dispute in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. The five bystanders ranged in age from 8 to 57 and were treated at Kings County Hospital and released. The police did not release the names of the victims.
Mrs. Williams was on "her very first trip to the United States," said her sister-in-law, Carmel Smith of the Wakefield section of the Bronx. She said Mrs. Williams, who had come to visit relatives, arrived on Thursday night and had planned to return on Wednesday. On Saturday, Mrs. Williams went with a niece to see friends in Corona, where she was hit by the stray gunfire during "a dispute on the street between some people," a police spokesman, Officer Andrew McInnis, said.
Mrs. Williams was born in St. Catherine in Jamaica, and as a child moved to England with her family, relatives said. She married and had five children, now aged 3, 6, 12, 14 and 16, Mrs. Smith said. The children remained in London during their mother's trip to America. Mrs. Williams, who was separated from her husband, worked part time in an office.
Ms. Caraballo, who had been unemployed for three years, had been working as a dispatcher at the Borinquen Car Service for only two weeks, the owner, Fabio Mata, 37, said yesterday.
A friend, Anna Gonzalez, 32, said Ms. Caraballo lived with her daughter, Lucy Jimenez, and had two sons, Hector Jimenez, who is an auxiliary police officer in the 79th Precinct, and Tony Jimenez.
Details of the shooting were still being investigated yesterday and it was not clear if any of the five people in a car parked at 849 Flushing Avenue near the car service were the gunman's targets.
Two of the passengers, Orlando Villanueva, address unknown, and the unidentified boy were wounded, the police said. Yesterday evening, Mr. Villanueva was in serious but stable condition at Bellevue Hospital Center and the boy was in stable condition with wounds to the neck and shoulder.
The police were investigating whether a dispute at the car service earlier on Saturday prompted the shooting.
The Flatbush shooting began at 9:22 P.M. when a man chased two other men and fired at them, missing them but striking the five bystanders in front of 324 Nostrand Avenue, the police said.
A short time later, at 9:48 P.M., a man believed to be one of those who was chased in the earlier shooting shot two men in front of 261 Lenox Road in the Flatbush section. Both men were treated at Kings County Hospital and released. The police did not release their names.
The police arrested Lawrence Simmons, 30, of 1225 New York Avenue in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn, in the shooting as he rode on his bicycle, with a 9-millimeter pistol in his hand, past the scene of the earlier shooting, a police spokesman, Sgt. Nicholas Vreeland, said. Mr. Simmons was charged with two counts of attempted murder, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon.

HEADLINE: In Bridgeport, Higher Property Taxes Just Add Injury to Accumulated Insult

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., June 9

 BODY:
Insult is not hard to come by here. Suburbanites boast that they never visit Bridgeport, the state's largest city and the banking and legal center of Fairfield County. A county atlas shows Stamford, not Bridgeport, on its cover. Amid Fairfield's sometimes stunning affluence, the city's flagship hotel advertises rooms for $49.
Pawnshops seem as common as convenience stores. The University of Bridgeport, a private institution, has half as many students as 10 years ago. Citytrust Bancorp, a major bank, has a negative net worth. When the city's high schools were admitted -- on a trial basis -- into the Fairfield County Interscholastic Athletic Conference this spring, the decision carried the weight of history, as though Bridgeport itself had been admitted into the county.
 
'A Leper Colony'
 The feeling of accumulated insult has much to do with Bridgeport becoming the first city in the nation to enter bankruptcy court. The alternative was a big property-tax increase, on top of what was already the state's highest local tax rate, only to balance a budget that would leave streets dirty, parks unmowed, beaches without lifeguards, libraries and centers for the elderly closed. 
 This is a city that feels it has paid enough, and that now it is time for others to help.
"Bridgeport right now is a leper colony," Alderman Thomas J. White said on Thursday, unaware, like most of his colleagues, that Mayor Mary C. Moran was preparing to file for bankruptcy protection that afternoon.
"The attitude in the suburbs is, 'You made your problems, now live with them,' " he said.
Bridgeport offers constant reminders of past glory and precarious future, of glaring contrasts between wealth and poverty that divide the city and cut it off from its suburban neighbors.
Along Main Street, one end of downtown is anchored by the sparkling headquarters of People's Bank, an almost playful office tower by the architect Richard Meier. At the other end, a half-dozen blocks north, a landmark hotel's windows are boarded up, its roof half collapsed by fire.
Along Long Island Sound, masts from a marina stand in the near distance behind the P. T. Barnum Houses, a project so grim it looks like a work camp. A mile west, the comfortable Black Rock neighborhood rises to hilltop estates above St. Mary's by the Sea, a waterfront promenade.
What is increasingly missing between the extremes of Barnum and Black Rock is the middle class, which in Bridgeport is largely white. The 1990 census found only a slight decline in population, counting 141,686 people. But non-Hispanic whites declined by 20,000, to 45.6 percent, from 59.4 percent in 1980. Blacks grew to 25.2 percent, from 20.2 percent. Hispanic groups, mainly Puerto Rican, grew even faster, to 26.5 percent, from 18.7 percent.
Among the departing whites were many younger families. Left behind were an aging white population in the North End and a young and growing minority population concentrated around housing projects in the poor neighborhoods of the East Side, South End, and increasingly, the West End.
Among Bridgeport's whites, according to the census, only 20.1 percent are under 18 years old; 33.5 percent of blacks are under 18, as are 37.6 percent of the Hispanic residents.
 
'What Do You Get?'
 Laurayne Farrar-James, an Alderman who represents an East Side district that is 90 percent black and Hispanic, said the divisions within the city intensify a common conviction that Bridgeport does not provide enough services to justify higher taxes, much less the 18 percent increase required by the budget imposed by a state financial review board on Friday.
In her neighborhood, she said, garbage is often not picked up, streets are dirty and crime is a constant problem. Some people have told her they would support higher taxes if that would greatly improve services, but instead, the new budget on July 1 will eliminate all street cleaning, half of the city's centers for the elderly and all of its youth-recreation programs.
"What do you get for your money?" asked Susan Powley, who lives on the Trumbull border. "Garbage and snowplow and the right to use Seaside Park."
With annual taxes on modest colonials and ranches commonly $3,000 to $4,000, and car taxes and a sewage tax adding hundreds more, the North End is acutely aware that taxes in neighboring Trumbull and Fairfield can be nearly half that, that their schools are excellent and that many of their residents commute in and out of Bridgeport without contributing anything to the cost of the city's social services.
"It's not a grass-roots thing, it's legislative," Mr. White, who represents the North End, said of the Common Council's resolve to avoid a large tax increase. "The aldermen are absolutely opposed, because we are overtaxed and our suburban neighbors are artificially undertaxed."
Both the well-off and the poor feel trapped, in part by the same recessionary pressures that are pushing Bridgeport's strained finances to the limit.
Many homeowners who stay do so because they cannot afford to move, and they fear that the city's bankruptcy action will further depress house prices.
"You can't move out because nobody's buying," said Israel Velazquez, a General Electric worker who owns a house on the East Side.
In the last few years the city has lost 14,180 jobs and three of its largest remaining factories, Remington Arms, Bryant Electric and Carpenter Steel.
"People say the city should be run like a business," Alderman White said. "Well, let me tell you, if it was a business it would have moved out. It would have gone south."
 
Paying Now for Spending Then
 Many people blame mismanagement for the current crisis, in which Bridgeport faces an 18 percent increase in property taxes to close a $12 million gap in its $308.2 million budget. But the state officials who oversee the city's finances, and who oppose its efforts to seek bankruptcy protection, say there is little room to maneuver.
Donald A. Kirshbaum, executive director of the Bridgeport Financial Review Board, said residents have reason to believe they do not get much for their taxes. Twenty-five percent of their payments, or $30 million, is spent on the past: police and fire pensions, full health insurance for retirees and the $60 million in bonds sold in 1989 to bail the city out of a crisis then.
Now the economy is sliding, Mr. Kirshbaum said, and "the bigger problem is that the state budget is under tremendous pressure."

HEADLINE: Dreams Fade in the Wine Country

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SONOMA, Calif.

 BODY:
During the wine boom of the 1970's, doctors, lawyers and others with money to invest started wineries. Many were seeking a gracious way of life, with their names on their own wine labels and enough profits to pay for new French oak barrels. Now, rising costs, lower consumption and increased regulation and taxation are weighing them down. Many want to sell, and some already have.
Peter Haywood was a successful 37-year-old building contractor who tired of battling planning commissions. In 1974, he planted a vineyard so he could work outdoors. Six years later, after selling grapes and making wine at home, he built the Haywood Winery in Sonoma County. It soon earned a good reputation, particularly for its zinfandel. But as a business, it languished. 
 "I could make the wine, but I couldn't sell the requisite amount to make it pay," he said. "I don't think any of us who began in the late 70's had an inkling that the market would level off and competition would increase several-fold."
In April, Mr. Haywood sold his brand and most of his inventory to Racke International, a German company that already owned the Buena Vista Winery in Sonoma.
For wine drinkers, a change of ownership often means a change in the bottle, for better or worse. Most wine critics agree that Buena Vista's wine has improved considerably since Racke acquired the brand, the state's oldest, founded in 1857. But Chateau St. Jean lost both its wine maker and its reputation after being bought by Suntory Ltd. The Wine Spectator magazine asked in a feature article about the label, "Where has the magic gone?"
Many other small wineries with strong followings are being acquired, often by foreign corporations, while weaker labels might vanish. In its fifth year of declining sales, the American wine industry is consolidating.
"There are many brands for sale," said Jean-Michel Valette, a principal in Hambrecht & Quist, a San Francisco-based investment banking firm that specializes in wine deals. There have been 14 purchases in the last two years, and at least that many are likely in the next 12 months, he said, adding, "There is a pent-up number of deals ready to happen."
Many wineries stay on the market for years as their owners hold out for glamour premiums. But buyers want only respected brands at prices low enough to promise healthy returns.
 
West Coast Phenomenon
 Weaker wineries, or strong ones at high prices, do not sell. The Spring Mountain Vineyards in St. Helena, Calif., the winery where "Falcon Crest," the evening soap opera, was filmed, has been for sale for nearly 10 years, with an asking price of about $20 million. Parducci Wine Cellars in Ukiah, Calif., has been on the market for two years.
"Most of the wineries don't provide any reasonable rate of return at their asking price," said Jon Fredrikson, a San Francisco-based consultant. A Napa Valley ordinance limiting growth has scuttled some deals there, he said, adding, "Unless there's the possibility of expansion, it scares away the big corporate buyers."
The pace of consolidation is picking up, particularly in California and Oregon, wine people say. In New York State, none of the roughly 100 wineries is known to be for sale, although some vineyards and some wine-making operations are. Some industry executives say several New York wine makers are shopping for wineries in California.
In a time of declining sales, strong wineries are growing largely at the expense of weaker ones. Wine makers shopping for small wineries say some sellers are urgently seeking buyers.
As wine consumption declined nationally, small premium wineries at first consoled themselves that people were drinking less but better. Most of the decline was in low-priced "jug" wines. But now sales growth of premium wines -- the industry category for those that sell for more than $5 a bottle -- has also slowed, and many analysts see a glut in wines costing $12 and up. Those wineries that continue to grow in the 90's emphasize high quality at a moderate price.
Some small wine makers who are trying to sell say they want to continue making wine while the new owner takes over sales and administration.
Besides selling his brand name to Racke, Mr. Haywood sold his wine-making operation to Ravenswood, another small producer. But he kept his vineyard. Mr. Haywood and his wine maker now work for Racke, which has shifted production of Haywood wine to the Buena Vista winery and added a medium-price chardonnay to the Haywood brand, increasing shipments to 50,000 cases from 10,000.
Wine makers who buy other wineries provide their sales forces with additional products and allow growth beyond the original brand. Haywood "had a small but tremendously loyal group of customers we thought we could build upon," said Stephen Cousins, president of Racke U.S.A. He said Racke expected to continue to grow by acquisition and by building its brands.
Even experienced wine makers find it hard to grow these days without a large partner. Charles Ortman had served as wine maker or consultant to more than 20 wineries before starting Meridian Vineyards, but his new winery languished.
 
Deal With a Unit of Nestle
 "Meridian needed a home," Mr. Ortman said. "It needed a building and much more capital than our limited partnership could raise."
Housed in a temporary structure, Meridian was dependent on the grape-crushing operations of other wineries. So he sold Meridian to Wine World Estates, a unit of Nestle S. A. that also owns Beringer Vineyards in the Napa Valley. Wine World moved Meridian from Napa to Paso Robles, on the central California coast, where Wine World had acquired vineyards, and has built it from under 10,000 cases to 50,000.
"Having marketing taken care of, I can focus all of my energy on making the best product," Mr. Ortman said. He had experience with Paso Robles grapes and liked the wine they made.
But not every small wine maker dreams of being acquired. Scharffenberger Cellars, which makes sparkling wine in Mendocino County, first had a marketing agreement with Fetzer Vineyards. Then Scharffenberger was acquired by the French Champagne houses of Lanson and Pommery, which in turn were acquired by the LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton conglomerate. Lanson and Pommery have since been sold again, to Allied-Lyons P.L.C., but Scharffenberger remains part of Moet.
 
'Swallowed Up by 3 Whales'
 "I've been the little guy swallowed up by three whales now, and I'm not too impressed," John Scharffenberger, the vineyard's founder, said. "The synergies just weren't there."
Mr. Scharffenberger said his small brand became lost in the large portfolios of his acquirers, so the increased sales force was no benefit, though he acknowledges that his large partner's capital is helpful. He prefers to do his own marketing, but for many small wine makers the sales and marketing power of a large organization are a major attraction.
One reason is that distributors -- the middle of the three-tiered system of alcoholic-beverage sales in the United States -- have undergone their own consolidation. In most major markets, the number of distributors has shrunk to two or three from a dozen or more in the 60's.
 
Advantage of a Big Company
 "To get that buyer's attention, you've got to have some people and some volume," said Terrence Clancy, president of the Wine Alliance, based in Santa Rosa, Calif. Wine Alliance, a unit of the British conglomerate Allied-Lyons P.L.C., has acquired Clos du Bois, Callaway and Atlas Peak and has an option on the William Hill Winery.
Consolidators like Wine Alliance and Racke can approach a distributor with a broad portfolio of wines, covering a range of price categories and styles.
The wines of small premium producers typically command higher prices, which translate into higher gross profit margins. But since sales and administration take a proportionately greater bite from a small business than from a large one, the small wineries are ultimately less profitable. If a consolidator can maintain the pricing of a premium wine, the economies of scale in the larger organization bring greater net profits.
"Larger wineries can pick up strong brands, bring them into the portfolio very efficiently and continue to get the high margins associated with these strong brands," said Gary N. Brayton, a principal with Deloitte & Touche in San Francisco who specializes in wineries.
If the people leaving the wine business now outnumber those entering, there are still plenty who dream of owning a winery and putting their names on the labels.
"It's similar to the restaurant business," Mr. Ortman of Meridian Vineyards said. "There are some looking to get out, and it is hard to make money, but there is money to be made if you go at it right. It can be done."

HEADLINE: The Last Dinosaur

BYLINE: By Andrew Stein; Andrew Stein is president of the New York City Council.

 BODY:
Many American cities, swimming upstream against the rough currents of economic recession and the loss of Federal aid, have adopted innovative ways of delivering services based on competition and consumer choice. But in New York City, it is business as usual.
Phoenix uses competitive bidding for some sanitation services and for street repairs and custodian services. (The city's public agencies are allowed to bid for the right to deliver the service.) 
 In Newark, N.J., two-thirds of all sanitation services have been privatized at a considerable savings to the taxpayer.
Some California cities -- for example, Visalia and Sunnyvale -- are moving away from traditional line-item budgets that allocate a fixed sum for specific agency functions but provide no incentives for saving money. Under the new arrangements, if managers save money they can keep some of it for new programs.
At City Hall, we have no trouble turning off street lights, closing libraries and museums and ruining the education system. But we have been reluctant even to debate solutions that would threaten the special interests strangling many agencies.
In the city's 1,000 school buildings, the custodians' powerful union still rules: The cafeterias of even our most overcrowded schools are mopped only once a week. Principals cannot tell janitors what to do.
In the sanitation department, antiquated union work rules mean many crews finish their routes in four or five hours and then spend the day at private pursuits.
An absurd six-month statute of limitations -- the only one of its kind in the state -- protects incompetent elementary and junior high school teachers from effective discipline.
All this is not entirely the fault of this administration. For too many years, the city assumed that the only way to solve problems was to create bigger and ever more unaccountable bureaucracies. From 1950 until 1990, the city workforce increased by 50 percent, although our population decreased by 7 percent.
To be sure, with New York's economy mired in recession and no longer producing sufficient revenues to sustain the bloated agencies, some officials pay lip service to "downsized government." What these words mean in practice is devastating across-the-board cuts in services.
The conventional wisdom seems to be that the way out of the fiscal crisis is to raise taxes, gut programs and wait for the economy to rebound. Presumably, when revenues start coming in again, city agencies can be restaffed and programs restored.
But this approach ignores economic reality. We can no longer ask businesses and the middle class to pay ever-higher taxes to sustain a huge mismanaged workforce -- certainly not when other cities and regions offer more efficient government, better services and lower taxes.
By applying a cleaver to essential services, the administration can produce a chimerical "balanced" budget by the July 1 deadline. But New York will keep hemorrhaging.
Only the discipline imposed by market forces can make the people running agencies constantly streamline their operations.
We can start by rewriting the work rules. Under state law, it is almost impossible to transfer a worker from one agency to another and layoffs must be based strictly on seniority. Thus, at times of fiscal crisis, City Hall cannot move workers around or get rid of the least efficient people.
When government has to compete with the private sector, it has to lower its costs and deliver services more effectively.
So let's think about allowing competitive bidding between private companies and city agencies for garbage collection, custodial services, street repair and building security, among other functions. And let's encourage greater productivity by providing managers with incentives for running their agencies more cheaply.
Municipal unions have long considered such approaches political taboos. But governing methods across America are changing, and if New York does not change, our city will go down in history as the last bureaucratic dinosaur.

HEADLINE: TENNIS;
Courier More Than Power Player

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 9

 BODY:
James Spencer Courier, a terrier of a tennis player who counts himself among Dade City, Fla.'s top three exports, along with orange juice and country music, established his credentials on a global scale this stormy afternoon when he turned Andre Agassi aside, 3-6, 6-4, 2-6, 6-1, 6-4, in the final of the French Open. It was the first trip to a Grand Slam final for Courier, who has a 4-0 finals record in his career.
Jubilant after a victory that improved his ranking to No. 4 in the world and earned him $451,660, Courier, the former Little Leaguer who likens his tennis stratagems to those of a pitcher, ripped his clay-stained white baseball cap from his head and threw it into the stands. 
 "It's each to his own as far as caps go," said Courier, who put his favorite topper, a Cincinnati Reds cap, into the closet after deciding it was "too trendy."
"This hat was special to me all through the tournament, but this tournament is over," he said.
 
Gaining Confidence
 Asked about his plans for Wimbledon, the next Grand Slam on the calendar, Courier, whose pedigree on clay is far more impressive than his performances on grass, only smiled and said: "Don't spoil my day. But I think I'll take a little bit of confidence in with me." Previously, Courier's best Grand Slam finishes came in the fourth rounds here, in 1989 and 1990, and at the 1991 Australian Open.
Courier, a 20-year-old product of the same United States Tennis Association development program that enhanced the careers of Michael Chang, the 1989 French Open champion, and Pete Sampras, the defending United States Open champion, spent his teen-age years alongside Agassi at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Bradenton, Fla. Courier graduated from high school in that period but turned down a tennis scholarship from Southern Methodist University in order to follow Chang, Agassi and Sampras onto the professional tour.
Last November, Courier began working with Jose Higueras, the same U.S.T.A. coach who guided Chang to this title two years ago. The union was not specifically intended to create another command coaching performance for Higueras in Paris, but that's what happened.
"Now he's two for two," said Courier, who has won two other major titles this year, at Key Biscayne, Fla., and Indian Wells, Calif., under the aegis of Higueras.
 The 38-year-old Higueras, a former Davis Cup player for Spain, first dedicated himself to transforming the redhead into less of a hothead, and then got to work on the rest of his problem areas. It was intelligent shot selection, not the shots themselves, that was lacking in the Courier repertory.
"The serve, the forehand, the slice backhand, we've been working on everything," said Higueras, who today provided Courier with the one piece of strategic advice that turned the tables on Agassi. Noticing that Courier was over-eager while awaiting Agassi's serve in the first set and a half, Higueras took advantage of a 20-minute rain delay to remind Courier to step back and give himself more time to prepare the sort of return that might damage Agassi's momentum rather than fuel it.
"When I saw that first set and a half, I saw that Andre was playing great and part of the reason for that was that Jim was playing right into his hands," said Higueras. Courier backed up, Agassi backed off, and the Floridian reversed a 1-3 deficit in the second set to even the match, a recovery that baffled Agassi.
Courier, who believes Higueras is responsible for injecting the proper degree of thoughtfulness into a talent that formerly traded too much on power and not enough on patience, took care to thank Higueras from the winner's podium and also invited the coach to a celebratory dinner.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 1.34, to 2,975.40; Trading Is Light

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Stock prices moved in a narrow range on light volume yesterday as many traders stayed on the sidelines amid deepening concerns over the recent surge in long-term interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average crept down by 1.34 points, to 2,975.40, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 mostly blue-chip stocks slipped 0.86, to 378.57, and the New York Stock Exchange's composite index eased 0.45, to 207.74. 
 Big Board volume plunged to 127.7 million shares, from 168.1 million on Friday, and 654 stocks rose while 904 issues declined.
 
Nasdaq Index Down 2.69
 Not only were the blue chips ignored, but so were many secondary issues, as witnessed by the drop of 2.69, to 495.85, in the Nasdaq composite index.
"The market's biggest concern is the recent sharp rise in long-term interest rates," said Robert B. Ritter, chief market analyst at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. "The fact that the Treasury securities market is also in the doldrums provided small comfort to the equities market."
Mr. Ritter added that while a lengthy parade through much of New York City's financial district drew many brokers and their staffs to their windows, it was not the principal cause of the low volume in the stock market. But low volume does inhibit many traders and others who prefer the relative safety of a more liquid market.
As it was, Occidental Petroleum was the Big Board's most active issue, rising 1 3/8, to 22 5/8, on a turnover of two million shares. News reports said Occidental had sold its stake in coal-mining operations in China and was involved in an oil exploration deal in Algeria.
Pepsico was a close second on no specific news, slipping by 3/8, to 30 1/4, on a volume of 1.96 million shares. Philip Morris edged down 1/4, to 66 1/8, and placed fourth after RJR Nabisco, which was unchanged. Philip Morris said it had no comment on a suit by the Securities and Exchange Commission charging a company executive with insider trading.
Time Warner, which was badly battered last week because of a negative reaction to a proposed rights offering, slipped a further 50 cents, to 94 1/8. Among some other issues in the news, Hilton Hotels dropped 2 3/4, to 43 5/8, after Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company lowered earnings estimates. Pfizer rose a dollar, to 57, after Cowen & Company reiterated its buy recommendation.
 
Gold Shares Rise
 An upward spike in gold that sent prices to their highst levels since last January was attributed to favorable technical factors. But the move helped some gold-mining shares. Homestake rose 7/8, to 16 5/8, and American Barrick was up 3/8, to 22 1/8.
At the American Stock Exchange, Echo Bay Mines, a Canadian gold producer, topped the most active list, rising 1/4, to 9 3/4, on a turnover of more than 496,400 shares. In all, Amex volume fell to 9.7 million shares, from 12.9 million last Friday, while its market value index slipped 0.21, to 369.77.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of U.S. Issues Little Changed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed in light trading yesterday, momentarily stemming last week's steep slide.
To some traders, the lack of activity came as something of a surprise, given the sea change in market perceptions wrought by economic data that strongly suggest the recession is about over. 
 "I thought people would make up their minds to do something after the weekend, because we had very significant news last week," one trader in government bonds said. "The numbers put a lot of grist in the mill for the argument that the bottom is here. But there hasn't been any follow-through."
 
Hints of Rebound
 Over the last month, declines in weekly initial unemployment claims and an improvement in auto sales have offered hints that the economy might be turning up.
But the galvanizing event for many traders and economists was the May employment figures released on Friday. Those figures showed that for the first time in 11 months employers added workers to their payrolls.
"There is no question that the data are signaling a recovery, and not some ephemeral upturn," said Anthony J. Vignola, chief economist at Kidder, Peabody & Company.
On Friday Mr. Vignola revised his growth estimates for the economy, and now expects a more vigorous performance for the balance of the year. The employment numbers were not the "driving force" behind the change in the firm's forecast, he said.
 
3.8 Percent Growth Forecast
 "The big question is not what is going on in the second quarter, but what will happen in the third," he added. "If the auto industry performs as expected, our forecast of 3.8 percent third-quarter growth is probably conservative."
Until last Friday, Mr. Vignola had projected second-quarter growth at 1 percent, to be followed by 2.9 percent in the third quarter. He now expects growth in the second quarter to be 1.7 percent.
"The fact that most people think that the turn has come has made people negative" on the bond market, another trader said, "but barring some bad inflation numbers later this week I think we will be stable until new supply hits the market later this month."
 
Unchanged From Friday
 By late yesterday, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 96 7/32, down 2/32, to yield 8.47 percent, unchanged from late Friday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 1/8, down 2/32, to yield 8.27 percent. And the 6 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 5/8, up 1/32, to yield 6.95 percent.
At the weekly auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills, the three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.60 percent, up from an average rate of 5.59 percent at last week's sale.
Bids on the new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 5.78 percent, up from an average rate of 5.71 percent a week ago.
 
Activity Extremely Slow
 Activity in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds was extremely slow, traders said. Prices of most issues were unchanged on the day.
"Once people get comfortable about where the Treasury market is going, then they will focus on the corporate market," one corporate bond trader said. "Until that happens we aren't likely to go anywhere."
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, the $675 million worth of New York City securities that were sold last week were freed to trade.
Market participants said that continued demand for 30-year New York City securities pushed up prices yesterday. The new city bonds, which offered a maximum yield of 8.55 percent when they were sold, were offered at a price to yield 8.50 percent late yesterday. "Demand is there because people tend to realize there are not a lot of bonds with those sorts of yields out there," one municipal bond trader said.
 
Prices Mostly Unchanged
 The flurry in the New York City securities was the only activity in an otherwise dull session. Prices of most widely quoted securities were unchanged on the day, municipal bond traders said.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar in a Broad Retreat, But Gains Against the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against major foreign currencies yesterday but rose against the Japanese yen as traders expressed uncertainty over the future of Japan's economy.
At least 10 European central banks and the Bank of Japan sold dollars in European trading in an attempt to control the dollar's rise, traders said. 
 The dollar closed at 141.55 yen in New York, up from 140.35 yen on Friday. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 141.17 yen, up 1.78 yen from Friday's close of 139.39 yen. In London, the dollar was quoted at 141.90 yen.
The United States currency continues to show strength as signs emerge that the United States recession has bottomed and the economy is resuming growth, currency analysts said.
"This dollar will continue to be bid because basically our economic woes are behind us," said Jesse Torres, senior trader for the Bank of Boston, commenting on the rise in the dollar.
Dealers said the Bank of Japan started the intervention in Tokyo dealings, a move they said had been expected after Friday's rally in the dollar on news of better-than-expected United States jobless figures for April.
The European selling was led by the German central bank, which was joined by the central banks from Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Britain, France, Austria and the Netherlands, dealers said.
 
Decline in British Pound
 The British pound fell to $1.6685, from $1.6710 late Friday in London. In New York, it cost $1.6705 to buy one pound, less expensive than $1.6710 late Friday.
Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.76785 German marks, down from 1.7720; 1.5105 Swiss francs, down from 1.5190; 5.9875 French francs, down from 5.9985; 1,312.00 Italian lire, down from 1,312.75, and 1.14705 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14775.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Strong War Support, but Some Erosion

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Despite the political unrest and lingering refugee problems that have mired American soldiers in Iraq, public support remains high for President Bush personally and for his actions in the Middle East, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
But behind the patriotism and pride of the parades through New York and Washington lies a growing concern among some Americans. They say the Persian Gulf war was not worth its price in lives and other costs and was not likely to produce the opening for a lasting peace in the Middle East that Mr. Bush has predicted. 
 A large majority of Americans, 72 percent, still said the United States did not make a mistake when it went to war to drive Iraq's occupation forces from Kuwait. And 80 percent, including a large majority of every social, regional, racial, educational, generational and income group, said they took pride in the action.
But with American troops still in Iraq and President Bush unable to show progress in his Middle East peace initiative, the poll indicated a slow but steady erosion of the post-war euphoria. The erosion was reflected in an equally consistent decline in approval for Mr. Bush's handling of foreign policy and for his performance in general.
 
Foreign Policy Score Falls
 The number of Americans who said they approved of the way Mr. Bush was handling his job over all dropped from the extraordinary high of 88 percent in March, soon after the war ended, to 75 percent in the new survey. This is the first time Mr. Bush's approval score has dipped below 80 percent in Times/ CBS News polls since the war.
This may result from a drop in the number of people who said they approved of the President's handling of foreign policy, from 83 percent in March to 68 percent in the latest nationwide telephone poll, which was conducted among 1,424 adults last Monday through Thursday, before the huge victory parades in Washington and New York.
Americans' approval of Mr. Bush's handling of the economy, now much lower than for his foreign policy, has not changed measurably. In the survey, which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, 48 percent said they disapproved of how Mr. Bush was dealing with economic problems and 41 percent said they approved.
The historic peaks that Mr. Bush achieved immediately after the war could hardly have been sustained for long. And since researchers have to go back to Dwight D. Eisenhower to find a President nearly as popular as Mr. Bush at this point in his first term, the new declines probably do not pose a serious threat to the President's chances of winning a second term in 1992.
Rather, Mr. Bush seems to be headed back toward a measure of popularity and approval that, while still unusually high, might be more sustainable in the long term.
The new survey also seemed to reflect less a decision by Americans that they now regret the war than an awareness that what seemed to be a clear-cut victory has frayed into a more confused peace.
 
Views on Broader Peace
 Indeed, Mr. Bush and his advisers have long acknowledged that the longer American involvement in Iraq dragged on, the more difficult it would be to hold onto the strong support they enjoyed at the height of the battlefield successes.
While Mr. Bush has said the war created a "window of opportunity" to pursue a larger peace in the Middle East, only 38 percent of those surveyed said they thought "a lasting peace in the Middle East" was more likely. Thirteen percent said the war made it less likely and 46 percent said the war would not make much difference.
In addition to the 80 percent who said they felt proud about what the United States had done in the Persian Gulf, 6 percent volunteered that they were proud of American troops, if not of the Government. Only 10 percent said they were not proud at all.
These figures were essentially unchanged from those of a survey immediately after the fighting stopped on Feb. 28. But there was a significant shift on another question: the number of people who said the war was not a mistake, 72 percent, was down from 80 percent in late February, and the 22 percent who said it was a mistake was up from 13 percent at the end of the war.
And while 66 percent of Americans, when reminded of the loss of life and others costs of war, said the war was worth it, the number who disagreed nearly doubled, to 30 percent now from 17 percent in the February poll.
As Mr. Bush is keenly aware, the continued power of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq still troubles many Americans. Sixty-nine percent of those surveyed said the United States should have continued fighting until Mr. Hussein was removed from power, up from 63 percent in May and 55 percent in late February.
The survey provided few other clues about the decline in approval of Mr. Bush's handling of foreign policy.
A substantial plurality of 47 percent said the United States should give China the same trading privileges that it gives to other friendly nations, which Mr. Bush has done. Thirty-nine percent said China should not have those privileges.
When it came to the Soviet Union, 62 percent said the United States should extend trading privileges and 27 percent said it should not. Mr. Bush is poised to give this "most favored nation" status to the Soviet Union.
But just as Mr. Bush faces opposition in Congress to extending financial aid to the Soviets, 59 percent of those surveyed said they would oppose giving money to help reform the Soviet economy. Thirty-four percent said they would favor such aid.
There was a large increase in those who said that, over all, trade restrictions were necessary to protect American industries: to 63 percent now from 51 percent in June 1990. Twenty-seven percent said free trade must be allowed even if domestic industries were hurt by foreign competition.
 
Most See Economy as Bad
 On domestic issues, 57 percent of Americans said the economy was fairly bad or very bad; 41 percent said it was fairly good, while only one percent said it was very good.
There was a small shift, to 23 percent from 18 percent in April, in those who said they thought the economy was getting better. But 47 percent said it was the same and 29 percent said it was getting worse.
As is often the case, bread-and-butter issues like the economy or unemployment were most frequently listed as the biggest problems facing America, and there were signs that health care, an issue that political strategists are seizing for the 1992 campaign, is indeed important to Americans.
Sixty-four percent said the Government should require employers to make health insurance available to all their workers, up from 56 percent the last time this question was asked, in April 1990, while 29 percent said health insurance should be left up to the individual employer.
Sixty percent said they favored national health insurance financed with tax money to pay for most forms of health care, while 30 percent said they opposed such a plan.
 
 
 
How the Survey Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted June 3 to 6 with 1,424 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened so that calls would be placed only to residences. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll. The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for blacks it is plus or minus about 10 percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Stadium and Home on List of 'Endangered' Places

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
Independence Hall is falling down, and so are Tiger Stadium in Detroit and Montpelier, the Virginia home of James Madison.
They are on the fourth annual list of "America's 11 most endangered historic places," to be published Tuesday by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a Congressionally chartered nonprofit group dedicated to restoring America's crumbling monuments. 
 Although the plight of these sites has long been known, the group hopes its listing will focus attention on the disintegration in a new appeal for aid from both government and private sources. Several of these sites, including Independence Hall and Montpelier, have benefited from restoration efforts, but much more needs to be done to preserve them, the report says.
 
Lessons From the Past
 The places on the list evoke memories and teach the lessons of history. Some, like the 65-year-old Franklin Post Office in Franklin, Tenn., continue to perform their original functions.
"Every one of these places has a very special utilitarian value," Jack Walter, president of the group, said in an interview. "You go to Independence Hall to learn how to be a better citizen tomorrow. You go to Tiger Stadium to keep alive a tradition that goes back to 1901."
First constructed that year as Bennett Park, the stadium was rebuilt in 1912, the same year Fenway Park opened in Boston.
Tiger Stadium, where legends like Ty Cobb, Hank Greenberg and Al Kaline set records, needs renovation and expansion. "This landmark is a symbol of stability for a city that has suffered major social, political and economic upheavals of 20th-century life," the report said.
Walden Pond and Woods in Concord and Lincoln, Mass., where the writer and philosopher Henry David Thoreau lived and wrote, is also on the list. "It is somewhere you go to think about the environmental movement that Thoreau founded," Mr. Walter said.
Independence National Historical Park, which includes Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell and the Founding Fathers' meeting places, "lacks adequate resources to repair leaky roofs, replace archaic fire-sprinkler, plumbing, heating and air-conditioning systems or remove such potential hazards as asbestos and PCB's," the report said.
The Madison mansion "needs to be stabilized and its enormous copper roof replaced," the report said. In addition, 135 of Montpelier's adjacent buildings need maintenance or rehabilitation.
Montpelier, Tiger Stadium, the Franklin post office, Independence Park, Walden Pond and Woods and the Southeast Light on Block Island, R.I., now menaced by the Atlantic, are making their first appearance on the National Trust's annual listing.
This year's list also includes some holdovers:
Antietam National Battlefield Park in Maryland, site of a bloody Civil War battle, because of encroaching development.
Fort Frederica, on St. Simon's Island, Ga., "in danger of being overwhelmed by a modern commercial complex."
Kennecott Mines in Kennecott, Alaska, afflicted by "harsh winter snowfalls, spring floods and vandalism."
The Penn School in Frogmore, S.C., one of the earliest schools for freed slaves, which is suffering from the "severe coastal climate, termite infestation and lack of funding for maintenance."
South Pasadena, Calif., where historic neighborhoods are endangered by a planned freeway.

Unisys in $207 Million Deal To Sell Timeplex Subsidiary

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, June 10

 BODY:
The Unisys Corporation said today that it would sell Timeplex Inc., a computer networking subsidiary, for $207 million to a joint venture led by Ascom Holding A.G., a Swiss telecommunications and automation concern.
Unisys, a military contractor and the nation's third-largest computer maker, said the sale, which should close before September, would help trim its debt, which stood at $3.43 billion at the end of March. Unisys lost $551 million last year on revenues of $10.1 billion, largely because of big interest payments. 
 The deal for Timeplex, based in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., and other real estate transactions this quarter would put the company's total asset sales at more than $500 million since early 1990.
The company's debt-reduction goal for this year is at least $600 million, Peter Hynes, a Unisys spokesman, said from the company's headquarters in Blue Bell, Pa.
In the last month, Unisys also announced the sale of its Detroit office building and 31 surrounding acres and said it would sell 2.2 million shares of its Japanese subsidiary, Nihon Unisys Ltd. Last week, the company said a subsidiary, the Unisys Credit Corporation, had sold $131 million in lease-receivable backed certificates. Industry analysts said Unisys also appeared to be trying to sell its military business.
"Despite an extremely difficult economic environment since our asset sale program began in early 1990, we have realized $170 million in cash, primarily from real estate sales, through March 31, 1991," said James A. Unruh, the Unisys chairman and chief executive.
Tom Willmott, an analyst at the Aberdeen Group in Boston, called Timeplex one of Unisys's "rubies," and said the company might have to sell more of its better assets to protect its "milk and butter" subsidiaries.
But he cautioned that the sale might not be as helpful as it appeared. "When you divide it up and sell it off, you still end up in debt," Mr. Willmott said.
Unisys bought Timeplex in January 1988 with $330 million in Unisys stock. The company employs 2,300 workers in more than 40 countries.
Unisys stock fell 37.5 cents today, closing at $3.75 on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: U.S. Rebuffed On Rates Cut

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BASEL, June 10

 BODY:
The world's top central banking body today dismissed calls from the Bush Administration for lower world interest rates, saying it was more important to tame inflation than to act hastily to overcome recession.
The Bank for International Settlements implicitly rebuked the Treasury Department for calling on other leading economies to use rate cuts to spur growth. 
The bank said inflation, not cyclical economic swings, should be central banks' No. 1 enemy.
"The upswing will start from a relatively high level of inflation and that is my concern," the organization's president, Bengt Dennis, said. "We should try to avoid a situation where we have to brake the upswing and tighten our monetary policy again."
Mr. Dennis was speaking at the end of the Basel-based bank's annual meeting. The meeting brought together top officials from more than 80 central banks.
The United States Federal Reserve Board was represented at the meeting by Wayne Angell, a Federal Reserve Board governor, who said he supported Mr. Dennis. "There are no inconsistencies between me and Bengt Dennis," he said.
Mr. Dennis's warning on inflation mirrored recent shudders among American investors, who feared the nation's first recession in eight years might soon give way to rising inflation.

HEADLINE: Citicorp Plans to Spur Loans for Companies

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Citicorp said yesterday that it would begin a financing program this week that would help corporate customers borrow up to $1 billion in the commercial paper market.
Under the arrangement, which several other banks are studying, Citicorp's Citibank subsidiary will refer corporate customers with strong ratings from Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation to Premium Funding Inc., which was created by Citicorp and Merrill Lynch & Company. 
 Using proceeds from commercial paper it will sell through Merrill Lynch, Premium Funding will make loans for up to 120 days and repay the commercial paper as the loans are paid. The arrangement enables the companies to pay lower interest rates than if they directly sold their commercial paper.
 
Burden of Low-Profit Loans
 The new program, as well as changes Citibank is making in its other commercial paper programs for large corporations, will help it satisfy the loan needs of customers without burdening the bank with low-profit loans that require large amounts of capital.
Although Citicorp has recently raised more capital to comply with tougher standards that begin next year, it is trying to limit its need for still more capital by selling loans, or arranging financing programs like the Premium Funding one that help it avoid making new loans.
Good-quality corporations eligible to participate in the Premium Funding program would normally borrow at interest rates below the 8.5 percent prime rate, according to one banker who asked not to be identified.
 
Cost of About 6.20 Percent
 Through the Premium Funding program, he estimated, such companies might borrow currently at a cost of about 6.20 percent, or less than they would have to pay if they tried to sell commercial paper under their own name, and not much different than the cost of a bank loan.
"Premium Funding is not meant to be a cheaper source of financing than a bank loan," said Ken M. Wormser, a Citibank vice president. "It is intended to help corporations diversify their sources of funds." Bankers said the program might be especially attractive to corporations whose ratings were high enough to qualify them for low-cost bank loans, but which did not qualify for the top ratings needed for ready acceptance in the commercial paper market.
Merrill Lynch, which will sell Premium Funding's commercial paper to investors, has plans to include other regional banking companies, thereby expanding Premium Funding's lending ability to $3 billion.
In a similar plan, the Mellon Bank Corporation of Pittsburgh has created Allomon Funding to issue commercial paper and make corporate loans to Mellon's customers. Allomon's name was created from the names of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers, which converge in Pittsburgh to form the Ohio River.
 
Cut in Need for Capital
 To protect commercial paper investors from losses, Citibank has agreed to buy a minimum of 20 percent of the outstanding loans, or a larger amount depending on the size and quality of the loans issued by Premium Funding. By agreeing to purchase, if needed, only a small part of the loans, bankers will greatly reduce the capital they require to satisfy the needs of their corporate customers.
With an ordinary loan, for example, a bank would have to keep $8 of capital for every $100 lent. But with the Premium Funding program, Citibank will need to have only $8 of capital per $100 of purchase commitment.
The introduction of the Premium Funding program comes at a time when Citicorp is revamping other commercial paper programs used to finance corporate trade receivables.

HEADLINE: Indians Balance Changes and Tradition

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
When New York City's first Hindu temple opened in Flushing, Queens, 14 years ago, volunteer priests had to be culled from the handful of devotees who worshiped before silver-sheathed sculptures of ancient deities.
Now, seven full-time priests minister to a congregation of thousands of Indian immigrants. On some feast days a line of barefoot worshipers snakes down the ornate temple's steps waiting to chant prayers and make offerings of fruits and flowers. 
 "The demand has far outstripped what we have," said Dr. Alagappa Alagappan, chairman of the temple, the Hindu Temple Society of North America.
 
Growing Population
 In the latest sign of the growth and vitality of the Indian community in New York, the temple broke ground last month on a $4.5 million addition that will house a wedding hall, auditorium and banquet room.
The city's Indian population has skyrocketed from about 6,000 in 1970 to more than 94,000 in 1990, according to the Department of City Planning. Many of those immigrants came as part of a stream of professionals who began arriving from India's teeming urban centers after American immigration rules were liberalized in 1965.
Their familiarity with city life and English has helped many to blend prosperously into the city's economic mainstream and eventually to send for relatives in India. Now many Indians here find themselves grappling with a common struggle among immigrants: the battle between parents and children over maintaining traditional values or adopting American customs.
"The tension is increasing between maintaining Indian traditions and adapting to American society," said Dr. Madhulika Khandelwal, a historian at Queens College who has studied the post-1965 influx. "This is a society very much at the crossroads."
Indians have lived in New York City since the early decades of this century, when a handful of professionals and students settled here in search of opportunity. Many of them later played major roles in the nationalist movement for Indian independence.
In the 1950's, India endured a brain drain in which many unemployed college graduates left the country. But with strict limits on the number of Indian immigrants allowed into the United States, many settled in the United Kingdom and some African nations.
American immigration policy eased in the mid-60's, increasing the annual flow from 100 to 20,000 Indians. Thousands of doctors, engineers, scientists and academics, most of them young men, joined the small nucleus of students, diplomats and professionals who had preceded them here, and quickly landed jobs.
"The professional community has done exceedingly well," said Dr. Anand Mohan, a professor of philosophy and political science at Queens College who immigrated 35 years ago. "Most of them are pretty bi-cultural."
 
Greater Diversity
 As the first wave achieved economic success in the 1970's and applied for citizenship, they were joined by relatives, many of whom were not professionals. With those arrivals, Dr. Mohan said, the community's profile changed, making it more diverse and reflective of Indian society. Many of the new immigrants opened clothing stores, newsstands, electronics shops and insurance and travel agencies that catered to the growing community. Unskilled laborers who spoke limited English worked at gas stations, drove cabs or hawked newspapers.
Economics was the driving force that brought many of the immigrants here. For others, the motivations were even stronger.
Harbans Singh, who works for a courier service, said he and his parents left their farm five years ago to escape the turmoil in the Punjab, long plagued with feuding between Hindus and Sikhs, a separate religious group concentrated in the region.
In New York, such problems seem nonexistent. The various elements of the city's Indian community have coexisted with little factional strife, respecting one another's traditions. Perhaps it is appropriate that the bulk of the Indian community is in Flushing, an area first settled in the 1600's by Quakers fleeing religious persecution.
"There is no enmity or anything of that sort," said Sewa Singh, secretary of the Sikh Center on Parsons Boulevard. "We go to see our Hindu friends and they come to see us."
 
Traditional Prayers
 At last month's celebration at the Hindu Temple Society, devotees chanted ancient Sanskrit prayers while priests made offerings of incense, apples and split coconuts. The temple, with its conical, tiered towers embellished with figures of monkeys, peacocks and eagles, may look out of place to some, rising above a row of boxy Archie Bunker-style houses along a tree-lined stretch of Bowne Street -- but not to Mr. Alagappan. "John Bowne was a great religious freedom fighter," he said of one of founders of the Quaker community in Flushing. "Somehow all these things come together here."
Sikhs and Hindus work side by side at Wholesale Liquidators in SoHo, where turbaned security guards stand watch as young Indian women work the cash registers.
Suman Chand, a 19-year-old student at Queens College who works at the store, said Americans tended to see all Indians as a single group, a tendency that had carried over into her community.
"Here, Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims, we don't care, we stick together," she said. "We just think, 'Oh, they're Indian.' We share that."
They also share an abiding interest in news from the homeland, eagerly snapping up copies of Indian newspapers, most recently to read about the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the former Prime Minister. While some Indian political groups have chapters in the United States, many Indians said political activism was not a priority.
"You can't influence Indian politics by remote control," said Dr. Mohan, who added, "There is nothing to do but feel utterly helpless."
 
Preserving a Heritage
 Instead, some professionals have focused on charitable work, raising money to refurbish temples in their hometowns or to establish health clinics in rural villages.
"It is a drop in the ocean considering the needs of India," said Dr. Mohan, who has donated money to rebuild a 1,200-year-old temple in his ancestral village in southern India.
At the same time, some Indians are keeping a wary eye on the future of their community in the United States. "Our endeavor is to look forward," Dr. Alagappan said during the groundbreaking ceremonies at the Hindu temple. "We have to go forward in the 21st century and have the children preserve the Hindu heritage."
In a house adjoining the temple, barefoot children sat cross-legged on the floor repeating the prayers chanted by a temple priest. Across the street, a handful of young girls practiced the sleek, angular movements of traditional Indian dance. To entice more children to come to the temple, the adults have tried to leaven spiritual and cultural lessons with sports and academic activities.
The clash between traditional and contemporary values most often erupts when children become teen-agers. While they want to please their parents by excelling in school, they bristle at traditional strictures involving dating and dress. Some young women have even begun rebelling against arranged marriages.
Shriki Jhaveri, 35, who owns an ice-cream-making business, said assimilation is tugging at his children.
At home, Indian records play on the stereo while traditional food is served for dinner in a household where both parents speak their native language of Gujarati. But Mr. Jhaveri's two daughters -- aged 5 and 9 -- prefer Western dress and music and wonder why their friends can eat meat while their family is vegetarian. Mr. Jhaveri frowns when he thinks of the effect the openness of American society could have on them.
"They see too much openness of women, like on the beach when they are half naked," he said. "It's hard, because our children are picking up Western values, but I still want them to look to me for Indian guidance."
Jayakrishna Ambati, a 20-year-old medical student, said traditional values need not be rejected by the young. "There are youngsters who feel pulled by two cultures," he said. "It is important to glean the best of both worlds. You can do it."
 
Few Return to India
 Dr. Khandelwal said that while many immigrants have integrated into the economy and their professions here, they have tried to prevent the Americanization of their families and social lives. "Not all are going through tensions, but there are clear signs of a generation gap, which is there in India, too," she said. "The pressure to keep traditions is strong."
Despite the emphasis on cultural traditions and interest in news from their homeland, few Indians move back to India once they have migrated. For many, professional ties and the responsibilities of raising a family make them reluctant to pull up stakes. "Sometimes I think I would like to go back and set up a knitting factory, and the Government would help me, but we can't get financing for homes," said Mr. Jhaveri. "It just gets too expensive to go back."
Others have no desire to return. "I would never think of going back to India," said Harbans Singh. "Americans help each other, but it's the opposite in India. Everybody gives you a hard time."

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
Despite forecasts of a turnaround, new figures show that the banking industry is still deep in crisis. And the financial woes do not end there: The disclosure came as the nation's senior auditor prepared to tell Congress that the savings and loan bailout is in such disarray that its costs cannot be estimated.
On the banking front, the nation's senior regulator doubled his estimates for losses to the fund that insures deposits in commercial banks. The report that the fund could lose as much as $23.1 billion in 1991 and 1992 was tucked away in the last paragraph of a news release from L. William Seidman on the condition of the savings and loan rescue. Mr. Seidman is the senior official for both the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation, which oversees the savings and loan bailout. 
 To be sure, most regulators say the condition of the banking industry is not so grave as to require the kind of taxpayer bailout now under way to rescue the nation's savings and loans.
On Tuesday, Charles A. Bowsher, the Comptroller General, will tell Congress that Resolution Trust is in such disarray that it cannot be audited by the General Accounting Office and that the ultimate cost of the rescue thus cannot be calculated.
Mr. Bowsher heads the G.A.O., which is required by law to provide Congress with an audit of the trust corporation by the end of June every year. Its first audit was delivered last year.
Worried about the political impact of Mr. Bowsher's assessment on requests for more money for the bailout, the Administration announced today that it had appointed the deputy secretaries of the Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to "investigate and coordinate" audits of the trust corporation. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady is expected to go to Congress in two weeks with such a request.
For the F.D.I.C. fund that insures bank deposits, Mr. Brady has not sought new capital, but instead has asked Congress to increase to $70 billion the fund's ability to borrow from the Government. Mr. Brady has assured Congress that taxpayers will not be counted on to repay the borrowed funds, but that they will be repaid from industry contributions and sales of assets seized from failed banks.
Earlier this year, Mr. Seidman estimated that the bank insurance fund would post losses of about $14.9 billion in 1991 and 1992 from the collapse of 340 banks.
The actual value of the insurance fund is in dispute. Mr. Seidman said that his agency's preliminary audit showed that the fund was worth $8.4 billion at the end of last year. Mr. Bowsher has said the fund is already "virtually insolvent" because it must also account for those banks that are likely to fail.
 
More Spending Forecast
 Mr. Bowsher is expected to tell the Senate Banking Committee that Resolution Trust is likely to spend significantly more than the $130 billion the Bush Administration projected last year.
Mr. Brady has repeatedly predicted that the savings and loan bailout will not exceed $130 billion, counted in 1990 dollars. The G.A.O. has put the cost as high as $500 billion over the 40 years that the Government is expected to borrow money to pay for the bailout.
In testimony prepared for delivery before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Mr. Bowsher says: "The best cost estimates for resolving failed thrifts today could be significantly understated and unexpected losses on asset sales could dramatically increase R.T.C.'s funding needs sometime in the future. R.T.C. headquarters is still unable to track all its assets in receivership or to provide information related to the book value, estimated recovery value, date of sale, sales price, and sale gain/loss on an individual asset basis."
A copy of the prepared testimony was obtained from an individual outside the General Accounting Office.
 
A Scathing Portrayal
 Earlier today, the G.A.O. made public a letter to Mr. Brady, sent in response to his request that the auditors identify specific problems at the Resolution Trust Corporation.
In a scathing portrayal of the trust corporation, the accounting office, an investigative arm of Congress, concluded that the agency had been unable to keep track of its growing inventory of billions of dollars in assets from seized institutions. In one instance, the G.A.O. found that Resolution Trust had awarded a contract to a company to manage $7.4 million in real estate that the agency had already sold.
The trust corporation has also apparently violated its own rules and awarded contracts to companies that have not met requirements to register with the Government.
But the problem that appears to present the greatest eventual cost to the taxpayer is the Resolution Trust Corporation's inability to accurately measure how much it should be receiving for the assets that it is selling. Mr. Bowsher concludes that this will probably mean that much of the so-called working capital that the Resolution Trust is borrowing and expects to recoup through sales may wind up becoming losses for the agency.
 
Asset Valuation Difficult
 Administration officials conceded today that valuing the assets in order to sell them and recoup top dollar would be difficult.
"Asset valuation is extremely tricky even in a good market," said Alfred A. DelliBovi, Under Secretary for Housing and Urban Development. "These are troubled assets to start with. Almost by definition, what's being wound down is junk."
But Mr. Bowsher said the trust corporation's "policy of aggressive discounting" could wind up meaning that the bailout would cost more.
"While everyone would like to see as many assets sold as quickly as possible for as much as possible, that dual expectation may be very difficult to realize," Mr. Bowsher said in his prepared testimony.

HEADLINE: U.S., in Shift, Will Back Aid to World Bank Unit

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
The Treasury has agreed to support a capital increase of up to $1 billion for the World Bank's private-sector lending division in exchange for organizational changes at the bank, Treasury and World Bank officials said today.
The Bush Administration had threatened to block the capital increase if the bank did not agree to devote 50 percent of its loans to the private sector in developing countries. 
 Under a compromise reached in the last several days, the World Bank will change its organizational structure to put more attention on supporting the development of the private sector in developing countries. The changes are modeled on moves the bank has already made to pay more attention to the environment and the role of women in development.
 
20 Countries Under Study
 The World Bank will study the private sectors in 20 countries over the next two years in connection with decisions on whether to finance economic restructuring programs in those countries. In addition, the president of the World Bank will head a new committee that will meet quarterly to review the bank's progress. And at least 20 mid-level officials will be hired soon to oversee the new emphasis on the private sector.
"They're not armchair economists, they're nuts and bolts executives," said a Treasury official who insisted on anonymity. "These should be people who have run companies, people who have run banks, and come from the developing world."
The World Bank's private-sector lending arm, known as the International Finance Corporation, had proposed a $1.3 billion increase in capital several months ago. A few World Bank board members, including the United States, favor an increase of $1 billion or less, while a slightly larger group of members favors a larger increase, said a World Bank official who insisted on anonymity.
The 22 members of the World Bank board are scheduled to decide the exact amount of the capital increase at a meeting on June 20.
The United States provides a quarter of the World Bank's capital and holds a quarter of the votes on major decisions at the bank. So, even though 155 countries are members of the bank, approval of capital increases virtually requires cooperation from the United States.
Some Democrats in Congress supported the bank in its opposition to the Administration's pressure. Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs, took the initial legislative steps to appropriate money for the bank unit even though the Administration had not included such spending in its budget.
The Administration had contended that the World Bank was too fond of providing money for big government programs and was too reluctant to lend to entrepreneurs.
The bank's private-sector arm has been obliged to slow its pace of new lending in the last two years for lack of capital, said the World Bank official who insisted on anonymity. New-loan commitments grew 20 percent a year in the late 1980's, he said, but only increased 16 percent in the 12-month period ending on June 30, 1990.
In the 12-month period ending this month, new-loan commitments are expected to have grown just 4 percent, to $1.5 billion.
Without a capital increase, loan commitments would grow by 6 or 7 percent a year in the 1990's, the official said, adding that with the increase, the commitments should grow twice as fast.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK SALUTES;
In a Ticker-Tape Blizzard, New York Honors the Troops

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Three months after the last angry rocket of the Persian Gulf war, New York City lionized the victorious troops yesterday with a magnificent blizzard of ticker tape, patriotism and affection in a homecoming parade up lower Broadway's Canyon of Heroes.
With painted yellow bows underfoot and a glimmer of blue between the skyscrapers overhead, brass bands exploded, flags and confetti whirled in the wind and what might have been another Monday in Manhattan's gray financial district suddenly boomed into a dazzling holiday of music, marching, balloons and deliriously roaring crowds. 
 And last night, capping the day's celebration, a giant fireworks display lighted the velvet skies over the East River with chrysanthemums of red, white and blue, thundering pirouettes of silver and gold and, for its finale, the simulated destruction of an Iraqi Scud by an American Patriot missile.
 
Misgivings for Some
 In the footsteps of Lindbergh, MacArthur, the Apollo astronauts and American legions home from World Wars I and II, some 24,000 marchers -- troops from 17 allied nations that fought in the gulf, plus veterans of other wars and civilian groups -- crossed the Rubicon into history under a deafening tumult of cheering and cascades of confetti and ticker tape.
But the day was not a one-sided blast of patriotism. For many, the euphoria that had followed the swift victory over Iraq with relatively few American casualties in January and February had given way in the intervening months to new concerns over recession, crime, sagging municipal finances, civil rights and other matters, and some felt that the time for orchestrated celebrations had passed.
Moreover, many Americans could not find triumph in the conquest of a nation with the gross national product of Kentucky, certainly did not regard the Persian Gulf war as a great victory, and were uneasy about a celebration that would surpass those for the far more devastating world wars or the profoundly bitter conflicts in Korea and Vietnam.
And in the rush of yesterday's tumult, some said, it was easy to forget that 150,000 had died on the other side, that Iraq's economy and infrastructure had been bombed back into the 19th century, that Kuwait was still little more than a family-run enterprise, that Saddam Hussein remained in power in Baghdad and that American troops were still in his country protecting Kurdish citizens.
Even so, the day meant a great deal to New York. It was a chance for the city to strut its stuff, despite fiscal crisis and recession, to express gratitude to those who sacrificed and died for the country, and to reaffirm some old-fashioned ideals in an age that seems preoccupied with money, political correctness and marketable sentiments.
"U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!" the crowds chanted again and again as the troops in desert battle fatigues and sharp dress uniforms, the bands, the floats, the missiles and other military hardware, the international color guards and the celebrities moved up the skyscraper-walled canyon.
 
'Great Day to Be Back'
 "It's a great day to be back home in New York," exulted Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was born in Harlem and raised in the Bronx.
The police estimated that 4.7 million people lined the one-mile route from Battery Park to Worth Street, and they called it the largest crowd for any single event in city history. The count, for all its seeming precision, appeared to be extravagant.
It implied that 235,000 people lined each of the 20 blocks on the route. The police conceded that it was based on a formula using square feet of street space and was a bit like numbering the blades of grass on a hillside. But it was in keeping with the hyperbole of the day.
"This was the mother of all parades," beamed Mayor David N. Dinkins, who had been using the phrase for weeks.
There was no disputing that the throng was enormous. People filled the broad sidewalks to capacity, gawked down from windows and rooftops at dizzying heights, spilled out of the plazas and side streets and choked four blocks of reviewing stands lining City Hall Park. And millions more watched on television.
It was an artist's conception of a spring day in New York: people in summery pinks and oranges for temperatures in the high 80's, an azure sky brushed with horsetails, the harbor shimmering in the sun like silver coins, and all along the parade route a palette of red, white and blue flags, yellow ribbons and desert-tinted uniforms. A brisk wind up from the Hudson swayed the trees in City Hall Park and blew the leaves in great masses like a woman's hair.
In the enormous fall of confetti and ticker tape, the sky at times grew dim, and the city and the parade seemed to recede in the storm as if into a framed picture. And for a while the familiar music of the streets, the bass rumble of traffic, the brassy horns were gone and all you could hear were the faint strains of "Hail, Hail, the Gang's All Here" or "The Halls of Montezuma," and above it all the madrigal song of a million cheering voices.
The four-hour extravaganza -- a $4.7 million private production that did not cost the hard-pressed city a cent -- was billed as the nation's biggest gulf war homecoming and the largest ticker-tape parade in New York history, and it was a day to remember.
 
The Negative View
 But, like any big event in a nation of diversity, there were those who disagreed with its substance and tenor, or whose enthusiams were at least tempered by the knowledge that this was just one of many parades and celebrations held across the country recently to mark the return of American forces, and that the conflict from which they had come home was perhaps the nation's least perilous war in this century.
Antiwar protesters dotted the route, but were concentrated at Vesey, Fulton and Ann Streets. "Operation Desert Massacre," proclaimed one sign mocking the march. "Jobs, health care and schools -- Not war!" said another. "This parade and the millions of dollars spent on it to celebrate the evil destruction of Iraq is obscene."
At least 25 protesters were arrested and 11 officers were injured in two clashes, one at Fulton, where a dummy was thrown into the path of the paraders, and another at Ann, where Christmas tree balls filled with red paint were hurled.
Many knew of the parade, but did not attend. "It's a bittersweet kind of celebration," said Carol Levine, a psychotherapist who had her bike out in Riverside Park. "It's not that I don't give a damn. I appreciate that we made an effort to do something, but it's a peculiar thing to celebrate, because Saddam Hussein is still in power and Kuwait is such a mess. I am left with a feeling that it is not resolved."
 
Festivities Start Early
 But for most of the people in lower Manhattan, it was a banner day of tribute to 12,000 troops from all 50 states and 17 nations, who marched with 6,000 veterans from other wars and 6,000 civilian groups ranging from bands and drill teams to dance troupes and fife-and-drum corps.
Even before the parade, the town was alive with activity. Mayor Dinkins, at a breakfast, gave the keys to the city to the three grand marshals -- Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, the gulf commander Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf and General Powell.
By 10 A.M. all motor-vehicle traffic was cut off to lower Manhattan below Canal Street, and extra subway trains ferried in the swelling flow of paradegoers joining the ranks of those who had staked out the best viewing spots before dawn. Within an hour, the sense of excitement along Broadway was almost palpable.
Vendors hawked T-shirts, buttons, hats, flags and other souvenirs; 3,000 police officers formed phalanxes on both sides of Broadway; workers in hundreds of government and corporate office buildings filed out, and the crowds grew so dense that some spectators were squeezed 15 or 20 deep on the sidewalks.
"You couldn't even move," said Samantha Simone, a 14-year-old from Garden City, L.I., who fainted in the late morning heat.
 
148 Treated for Heat
 The Emergency Medical Service said 148 people were treated for heat exhaustion in temperatures that reached a high of 89 at 2 P.M., and for a variety of other minor injuries. A spokesman said 103 were treated at the scene, and 45 were taken to nearby hospitals. Most had fallen from barricades or trucks, and two were hit by objects thrown from windows.
 
Generals Lead the March
 A trio of vintage convertibles carried the grand marshals and their wives at the head of the line of march. Mr. Cheney, in a business suit, General Powell, in his dress greens, and General Schwarzkopf, in his familiar battle fatigues, waved constantly through the barrage.
Behind them came thousands of soldiers, sailors and marines, most of them in battle fatigues with helmets or barracks caps and desert boots, with rifles at shoulder arms or assault weapons slung tightly on the right.
They moved in lock-step mostly, shoulders back, chests out, heads up, battle flags in the vanguard of each unit, representing infantry, armored, cavalry, airborne, intelligence, mountain, support, engineers, maintenance, medical, supply, communications and reserve detachments.
A 15-foot Patriot missile, orange with a white tip, rolled by on a truck, followed by its launch system on a flatbed 12-wheel trailer. A few howitzers and battle tanks, ambulances and an armored car were in the parade, but it was not a show of weaponry or technology, which had been amply demonstrated during the war and seen in other parades.
Behind the United Nations flag came Jeeps bearing the flags of 40 countries that had sent observers, but not marchers, to the parade, and then marching units from 17 nations that had been allied in the Persian Gulf.
 
Awash in Debris
 When it was over, shortly before 5 P.M., Broadway was awash in debris: 12,000 pounds of confetti, one million yellow ribbons, 200 miles of ticker tape, enormous reams of computer paper and envelops and thousands of unidentified, multicolored bits and pieces.
The half-hour of fireworks that ended the celebration began at 9:45 P.M. as rockets climbed above the East River, filling the night sky over lower Manhattan and Brooklyn with a dazzling display of exploding colors. Every pier and vantage point on both sides of the river was jammed with spectators who numbered "in excess of a million," the police said. One of the most popular viewing spots in Manhattan was the South Street Seaport, which was closed at 8 P.M. when it was filled. to capacity.
Just to the south on Pier 11, overlooking the river and the Brooklyn Bridge, two marines who had marched in the parade gazed at the fireworks and reflected on their day in New York. "I've never experienced anything like this," said Pvt. Richard Douglas, 22, who was in the Persian Gulf for eight and a half months. "I've signed over 150 autographs today on T-shirts, flags, arms and even legs."
Pvt. Nicholas Collins, 22, said: "The City of New York has spoiled us. The parade was incredible. This makes us feel like celebrities."

To the Editor:
"States and Cities With Deficit Woes May Slow Rebound" (front page, May 31) is so misleading as to be hysterical. To say "the Federal Government is not stimulating the economy" is sheer nonsense. The Federal deficit for this fiscal year will be about $300 billion; last year it was $220 billion. That's $80 billion of stimulation! Most "cuts" in state spending are not cuts, but rather "no increases," which is a totally different subject.

HEADLINE: At Polaroid, More Than Snapshots

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
At the Polaroid Corporation these days, talking about old-fashioned "instant photography" is out. The new chairman, I. MacAllister (Mac) Booth, talks instead of "rapid access, high-quality hard copy" -- terms more evocative of computer electronics than snapshots from family vacations. Mr. Booth would like doctors, researchers and business people wanting to take and transmit pictures to think first of Polaroid.
At the annual meeting last month, Polaroid executives displayed a spate of new products -- more, they say, than at any time in their history. These include a computerized system for producing medical images in seconds without traditional film; a digital scanner to enter pictures into computers, and a printer that makes instant snapshots from a computer screen. 
 The areas Polaroid seeks to enter are already crowded with much more experienced rivals, but Polaroid executives expect the great demand for computer-generated pictures to yield profits. "For us, even a small segment can be very lucrative," said Peter Kliem, a vice president.
Polaroid is trying to leap ahead in a year already marked by the death of the company's founder, Edwin H. Land; the retirement of his successor as chairman, William J. McCune Jr.; the expiration of key patents for the SX-70 instant cameras and film, and a sharp decline in profits.
Instant cameras are mired in a declining market. Video cameras, easy-to-use 35-millimeter Japanese cameras and one-hour developers have all eroded the demand for Polaroid's products. Instant-camera sales fell from a peak of 13 million units in 1978 to 4.5 million in 1990. Earnings grew in absolute terms, but at a rate that fell well behind inflation. If its new offerings fail, Polaroid may never regain the luster it had as an instant-photography innovator and the darling of Wall Street in the 1960's and early 1970's.
What Polaroid now calls family imaging, or instant photography for consumers, made up 70 percent of the revenues in 1978 but just a third today. Mr. Booth says that such figures actually illustrate the company's progress. "We don't mind being associated with instant photography, but we're not that narrow," he said. "There are plenty of applications for imaging outside of the barbecue."
Analysts are generally pleased with Polaroid's latest products, but doubt that the new technologies will deliver rapid payoffs. Some question whether Polaroid can crack these unfamiliar markets. "They have a limited capability to distribute through a direct sales force," said B. Alex Henderson, an analyst at Prudential Securities. Polaroid might have to rely on a major supplier of office equipment to sell its new products, he said. Mr. Booth himself warned that the cost of introducing new products and the prospect of lower earnings abroad portend a potentially dismal second half of 1991.
Mr. Henderson called the new products clearly important," but added, "They are a 1993 story." With nearly half of its revenues generated overseas, Polaroid may be rocked by a strengthening dollar, Mr. Henderson said, adding, "They've got a serious exposure to currency translations in the second half of this year."
This at a company whose earnings are already being hit hard. First-quarter earnings fell to $16.4 million, from $31.8 million a year ago, with earnings per share down to 13 cents from 43 cents. "The short-term prognosis is negative," said Eugene Glazer, senior vice president of Dean Witter Reynolds. "There's no momentum there and the recession is having a strong negative impact." Mr. Henderson expects Polaroid to earn $1.35 a share this year, down from $2.20 last year.
Then there have been some distractions: An interminable court battle with Kodak over patent infringement, in which Polaroid was awarded $900 million in damages, remains unsettled because of appeals by both companies. Fighting off a takeover bid by Shamrock Holdings Inc., an investment firm, preoccupied management two years ago.
Marketing has gone flat. The company that attracted Sir Laurence Olivier to make his only television commercial for its new SX-70 instant camera in 1972 has lost much of its pizazz.
 
Reorganized in '89
 In an effort to marry its instant-photography skills to computer technology, Mr. McCune brought Polaroid through a reorganization in late 1989 and declared the result an imaging company. The family- business- and technical-imaging divisions now each provide about a third of Polaroid's revenues.
Polaroid's fastest-growing, and healthiest, segment is its business division, which emerged when the company's executives noticed that they were selling more and more cameras to insurance companies, which use them to record damage, and realtors.
Mr. Henderson credits Carl Yankowski, the business-imaging group's vice president, with bringing needed marketing prowess to the company. Mr. Yankowski, 41 years old, went to Polaroid from Cadbury Schweppes three years ago -- the sort of executive from outside that the company once rarely hired.
In several other markets, company sales have been slower than Polaroid expected, Mr. Henderson said. The company is still searching for the right marketing campaign for the technical and industrial group, which includes professional photography, passport and identification photos and dozens of other niche markets.
Polaroid has tried to enter a host of other competitive new markets, like conventional 35-millimeter film, videotapes and even floppy disks. Mr. Booth acknowledges that those businesses have not been profitable; Polaroid has already quit selling floppy disks.
To stimulate camera sales and thus film sales, the company introduced its Onestep Flash instant camera earlier this year for less than $30. Mr. Henderson said that profit margins on the camera, now their least expensive model, were low, and that he expected the company's consumer sales to remain flat.
Polaroid's prosperity now depends on finding innovative products. "Their future is in their labs," said Brenda Landry, an analyst with Morgan Stanley.
Polaroid promises to begin selling a compact instant camera next year. Mr. Booth expects the camera's modest size and price -- the details are stil secret -- to attract buyers who have not bought a Polaroid before.
Analysts like Mr. Henderson are skeptical about the prospects for the new camera. He expects it to produce compact pictures the size of baseball cards. "Personally, I don't know why anyone would want it," he said.
Later this year, Polaroid will start shipping several other new products: the high-quality Hybrid 4 instant film; a digital scanner, to enter pictures into computers, and a computer printer that can produce snapshots.
 
New Imaging System
 The most distinctive new product is the Helios Laser Imaging System. Under development for more than seven years, Helios can produce medical images from ultrasound systems and sophisticated diagnostic scanners in 90 seconds; conventional photographic methods can take several more minutes to yield pictures that are usually not as sharp. The Helios system relies on a laser camera and digital computerized pictures. It will sell for $35,000, with its film costing about $1 a sheet.
Sheldon A. Buckler, vice chairman at Polaroid, predicts that Helios will bring in hundreds of millions of dollars. Mr. Henderson, the analyst, predicts sales of at least $200 million by 1994. and Polaroid has already demonstrated a color version of its Helios film. But Helios systems will not be widely available until well into 1992, while Polaroid will be paying off the development costs for several more years.
With the payoff from the Kodak suit possibly still years away, Polaroid needs many more developments like the Helios. The last of its key SX-70 camera patents are expiring this year. Ironically, as Polaroid awaits payment from Kodak on infringement of those patents, analysts doubt that Kodak or anyone else will jump into this decaying market now.
 
Need for Change Seen
 These days, Polaroid executives have little nostalgia anyway. Top executives openly speak of the need to reform a company where Mr. Land's spirit still lingers.
Mr. Land "did all the thinking; he was the only anointed generalist in the company," said Mr. Buckler, a veteran of 27 years at Polaroid. "He was a genius, a classic founder who had no great interest in organizational design," Mr. Buckler added. "He saw no reason to change."
In the last few years, Polaroid has recruited younger executives like Mr. Yankowski and James Ionson, a 40-year old astrophysicist who did research for the Defense Department's Strategic Defense Initiative, or "Star Wars." Mr Ionson will become Polaroid's head of research and development in August.
Still, the company remains dominated by quarter-century veterans like Mr. Booth, Mr. Buckler and Mr. Kliem. "We are searching for the right balance of the old and new," Mr. Buckler said. "There is a constant need for a 54-year-old company to unlock the mysteries of revitalization and rebirth."

Dollar Ends a Bit Higher; Gold and Silver Prices Drop

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended narrowly higher against most major currencies yesterday in quiet trading motivated largely by technical factors.
Gold prices declined after rising in Hong Kong. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $370.90 a troy ounce, down $2.80 from late Monday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $370 an ounce, off $2.70. 
 Silver prices also declined. On the Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.48 a troy ounce, down from $4.52 Monday. Silver fell in London to $4.51 an ounce from $4.52.
 
Quieter Than on Monday
 The dollar started out higher in Tokyo, then continued upward in Europe and the United States.
Currency dealers said trading was quieter than on Monday, when at least 10 European central banks and the Bank of Japan sold dollars for yen in Europe to control the American currency's rise. Concerns about the Japanese economy were largely responsible for the yen's selloff, analysts said.
On Tuesday, the Bank of Japan released its quarterly survey of business sentiment taken in May and said there was little fear of a sharp decline in economic growth.
The British pound, meanwhile, was under pressure amid widening concern of a possible split in Britain's ruling Conservative Party over embracing the European monetary union.
In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar rose 0.18 yen to close at 141.35 yen. It stood at 141.05 yen in London, and 141.25 yen in New York, down from 141.55 yen Monday.
The dollar was stronger against the British pound compared with Monday. Sterling fetched $1.6625 in London, down from $1.6685, and $1.6570 in New York, down from $1.6705.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late quotes Monday, included: 1.7735 German marks, up from 1.76785; 1.5160 Swiss francs, up from 1.5105; 6.0135 French francs, up from 5.9875; 1,319.00 Italian lire, up from 1,312.00, and 1.14435 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14705.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Monday, were: 1.7717 German marks, up from 1.7705; 1.5125 Swiss francs, up from 1.5120; 6.0090 French francs, up from 5.9940; 1.9963 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9940; 1,316.09 Italian lire, up from 1,313.25, and 1.1454 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1473.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $370.75 an ounce, from $372.75 late Monday. In Zurich, gold fell to $370.90 an ounce from $373.00. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $5.25 an ounce to close at $371.96.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Volvo Searching Hard for Relief

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, June 11

 BODY:
Although he professes to be optimistic, Christer Zetterberg, president and chief executive of Volvo A. B., has plenty of reasons to be gloomy.
The Swedish car company's most important markets -- the United States, Britain and Sweden -- remain severely depressed as the company tries to sell its most important new lines of luxury cars in nine years. The latest is the 850 GLT, a sporty sedan with a five-cylinder engine and front-wheel drive introduced today in Sweden. Volvo hopes the new car will attract younger buyers, many of whom now consider Volvo's offerings cumbersome and boring. 
 The 850 will go on sale in Sweden and northern Europe this year, and in the United States in October 1992.
 
High Absenteeism and Turnover
 Volvo is also struggling to lower its production costs. That is no small challenge in Sweden, where the worker absenteeism and turnover rates are the highest among industrialized nations.
Then, there is the task of making something out of an ambitious alliance with France's state-controlled Renault to develop and supply car, truck and bus components.
As if that were not enough, Volvo is forming a joint venture with the Mitsubishi Motor Corporation of Japan. In that deal, scheduled to be completed in September, Mitsubishi has agreed to buy a one-third stake in a Volvo plant in the Netherlands, leaving Volvo and the Dutch Government each with a third. Volvo and Mitsubishi plan to jointly develop new mid-size cars that would share major components and to raise the plant's annual capacity by some 50 percent, to about 200,000 cars. Mitsubishi is eager to grow in Western Europe: it is talking with Daimler-Benz of Germany about jointly developing and producing a four-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicle.
In a recent interview at Volvo's headquarters in Goteborg, Sweden, Mr. Zetterberg said a broader alliance of Renault, Mitsubishi and Volvo might develop. The three could supply each other with components like engines, he said.
That would be remarkable given how the French have been bitter opponents of anything that would help the Japanese expand in Western Europe, where they now have 11.4 percent of the auto market.
Volvo's success in dealing with these formidable challenges, analysts and competitors say, could determine whether it remains independent or follows in the footsteps of Jaguar of Britain and Saab Automobile, the smaller Swedish car maker. Both companies decided they could not make it alone; Jaguar was bought by the Ford Motor Company and Saab is now controlled by the General Motors Corporation.
"For Volvo to remain independent, it all has to work," said Philip Ayton, an analyst at Barclays de Zoette Securities Ltd. "By making their alliances, they have shown that they're aware they cannot make it entirely on their own."
 
Degrees of Efficiency
 Volvo executives point to their big assembly factory in Ghent, Belgium, as a sign that they can be competitive. About 40 hours of labor are required to weld, paint and assemble a car at the plant. That is fairly good compared with other European luxury car plants. And it is extremely good compared with the 60 hours needed at Volvo's main Swedish assembly plant in Goteborg.
But even Ghent looks horrible next to the mere 20 hours or so for Japanese assembly plants, a figure that comes from a study of the world car industry by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. With the Japanese moving even more aggressively into luxury cars, they are the ones to beat, Volvo executives concede.
These competitive pressures and a deep recession gripping nearly all of Sweden's manufacturers may be the shocks needed to convince Volvo's Swedish workers that their future is on the line, Mr. Zetterberg said. He is also counting on recent changes in Sweden's generous social insurance system, which had made it easy for employees to skip work and still receive full pay. Indeed, absenteeism and turnover are now dropping.
He said Volvo could not abandon Sweden, where nearly half of its assembling capacity and the vast majority of its components factories are. "But future investment will go where it is the most profitable," Mr. Zetterberg said.
The venture with Mitsubishi, he added, should also enable Volvo to learn Japanese methods for improving productivity and developing products faster.
Mr. Zetterberg, 49 years old, became Volvo's president in 1990, after a career in the banking and forest-products industries. He is the heir apparent to Pehr G. Gyllenhammar, Volvo's longtime chairman.
 
The Currency Factor
 Like most big Swedish manufacturers, Volvo profited handsomely in the early to mid-1980's as a big devaluation in Sweden's currency, the krona, let it sell its products at competitive prices in markets like the United States. Volvo especially benefited from the booming world car market and the success of its 700 series of cars. Introduced in 1982, the 740 and 760, with styling that updated Volvo's traditionally severe, if solid, box shape, became de rigueur in prosperous American suburbs.
But by the late 1980's soaring labor costs, sluggish productivity increases and a weakening of the dollar against the krona forced Volvo to impose some large price increases in the United States, its most important market.
These developments happened as the demand for luxury cars weakened, competition from Japanese models grew and the need for capital investment surged. Last year the car division had an operating loss of $149.5 million on sales of $6.89 billion, its first loss in a decade.
 
Heavy Spending
 Volvo has spent $2.13 billion in the last five years on modernizing and expanding its car-manufacturing operations and undertaking the most ambitious product-development program in its history.
The new 850 sedan will probably cost at least $25,000 when it goes on sale in the United States. The new offering follows the introduction last fall of the 940 and top-of-the-line 960 models and a new six-cylinder engine to power the latter. The 960 is scheduled to go on sale in the United States this fall, probably for about $37,000.
Automotive analysts say the 900 and 800 series of cars signal Volvo's intent to move more deeply into the luxury segment and out of the upper end of the volume market, where price competition is much greater. They say that makes sense given Volvo's high manufacturing costs.
The 240, which was introduced in 1974, is Volvo's cheapest car in the United States, where it sells for about $20,000. With many other good cars to choose from in the $15,000 to $20,000 range, "the 240's audience has had to be tempted by price," said John K. Lawson, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute Europe Ltd. Its sales plunged to 69,800 last year from a peak of 232,000 in 1983.
Volvo has discontinued the 760. Mr. Zetterberg said there were no immediate plans to stop making the 240 and the 740. But others at Volvo, who insist on anonymity, say the 240 sedan is likely to be phased out, leaving the station wagon version.
Volvo is counting on new safety features on the 850, including a patented system for protection against side impacts, to help maintain the company's reputation for making especially safe cars. But over the longer term, this will be difficult, analysts and competitors say.
"All manufacturers are doing a lot more in safety and it will cease to become the exclusive domain of any one company," said Louis R. Hughes, chairman of Adam Opel A.G., the German-based division of General Motors.
Analysts criticize Volvo for taking seven to eight years to develop the 850. Mr. Ayton said the lack of a new model in this size and price range was a major reason Volvo lost market share last year in the United States, Britain and Sweden. But Volvo executives say much of the company's problem comes from a decision not to cut prices as much as competitors did and the fact that Volvo's conservative customers are more likely to postpone buying cars in a recession. They expect worldwide sales this year to be below the 359,600 sold in 1990, Volvo's worst year since 1982.
 
Trying to Cut Costs
 Mr. Zetterberg says Volvo's biggest problem remains high production costs. A program is under way aimed at cutting annual costs by three billion kronor ($476.7 million) by the end of 1992 and raising the productivity of Volvo's Swedish assembly operations to the level of the Belgian plant by mid-1993. Volvo is cutting the work force in its Swedish car operations by 4,500, or 15 percent.
But Mr. Gyllenhammar also realized that Volvo needed much greater economies of scale in product development and purchasing or producing components. That explained the complex deal completed in January that linked Volvo and the car, truck and bus operations of Renault. To cement it, Renault and Volvo took large equity stakes in each other, with Volvo paying Renault $1.17 billion more than it received.
At least in cars, some analysts and competitors question whether an alliance between two weak companies -- especially without a full merger -- can succeed. Some think the car business of Renault may rebound, but its group profits plunged last year, when its share of the European car market dipped below 10 percent.
Volvo and Renault say big benefits from cooperating in purchasing and developing components will come, though not before the mid-1990's.

HEADLINE: Walesa Seeks Special Economic Powers

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, June 11

 BODY:
Sharpening his confrontation with a Parliament still dominated by former Communists, President Lech Walesa asked legislators today to empower the Cabinet to rewrite the nation's economic laws by decree.
The move reflects growing tension over the effects of this country's pioneering economic program, and frustration within the Government over the lawmakers' failure to approve more than two dozen pieces of economic legislation pending since January. 
 "In view of the economic situation in our country, I see the need to undertake without delay effective action aimed at quick improvement in the functioning of our economy," Mr. Walesa said in a letter to his Prime Minister, Jan Krzysztof Bielecki.
"The Government is facing the problem whether it will be able to continue its reform program," said Andrzej Drzycimski, spokesman for Mr. Walesa. "The President and the Prime Minister both came to the conclusion that such powers are necessary."
 
Request for Debt Relief
 The request to Parliament came as Poland asked Western creditors today to reduce its $33 billion debt a further 10 percent and put the money into a fund for projects aimed at stemming pollution. Of the 17 countries that make up the so-called Paris Club of Government lenders, only the United States and France have endorsed the proposal, which was relayed to ambassadors here by Prime Minister Bielecki.
In his statement to Parliament, Mr. Walesa asked for constitutional changes that would allow Mr. Bielecki and his ministers to issue decrees "with the force of law" for one year. He said the specific areas to be regulated were up to the Council of Ministers, or Cabinet, which is led by the Prime Minister.
Poland was the first country in Eastern Europe to oust Communism, but it is the only one that has not yet held fully free Parliamentary elections.
This paradox stems from the terms of the 1989 "roundtable" agreement, under which the Solidarity movement agreed that only 35 percent of the seats in the lower house of Parliament, or Sejm, would be freely contested, with the remainder reserved for Communists and their allies. A newly created upper house, or Senate, was to be elected without any constraints.
The result of the vote in June 1989 was that candidates affliated with Solidarity won 99 of 100 seats in the Senate and all of the available positions in the lower house. Communists and associated parties retained the remaining 65 percent of the seats in the lower house, even though they had garnered few votes in the election.
Since he took office in December, Mr. Walesa has been pushing hard to get rid of the Parliament, thus far without result. His initial demand for a vote in May was rejected by the Parliament and a scheduled vote in late October now seems imperiled by Mr. Walesa's veto this week of election rules that he said were unclear and certain to produce a fragmented Parliament. The President also objected to provisions that barred campaigning in churches and limited rights of emigre Poles to return and run in elections.
Initial response to his call for economic decree powers was mixed. Mikolaj Kozakiewicz, speaker of the lower house, praised the proposal and said in a statement that he would do everything he could to speed its passage which, as a constitutional change, must be approved by a two-thirds majority.
Bogdan Lukasiewicz, a member of the Peasants Party, said the President should give the Parliament more time to act on economic legislation.

Semiconductor Semi-Success

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
THE Bush Administration negotiators who pieced together the new computer chip pact with Japan are proud as peacocks. And with reason: They managed to dismantle protectionist rules that were anathema to the President's free-trade principles.
But the victory may prove bittersweet. Japanese chip exporters remain vulnerable to retaliation under American laws that effectively prohibit foreign competitors from cutting a product's price near the end of its commercial life. More important, the deal in no way alters the sobering reality that America has lost its deft touch in translating advanced technology into jobs and profits. 
 The old chip pact, signed in 1986 when Japan-bashing had reached its apogee of respectability in Congress, gave the Commerce Department power to set minimum prices for Japanese exports of memory chips. It also guaranteed non-Japanese chip makers -- notably American producers of microprocessors, the number-crunching brains of computers -- 20 percent of the Japanese market for semiconductors.
The 1986 agreement did diffuse pressure for tougher protectionism. But the deal still proved an economic embarrassment, generating windfall profits for Japanese chip manufacturers at the expense of American computer makers, who are major users of imported memory chips.
To enforce the price floor demanded by Washington, Tokyo organized a memory chip cartel to restrict exports. The resulting shortage cost American computer makers dearly, hobbling production just when Asian-made PC's were beginning to challenge their dominance of the global market. This time around, the Bush Administration adroitly exploited the computer makers' experience with the chip cartel. The new pact jettisons the costly price restrictions. And it transforms the Japanese market share guarantee into an agreement to disagree over what counts toward the 20 percent target. Retaliatory tariffs, imposed in 1987 after Washington decided that Japan was not playing fair on market access, were also scrapped.
That is welcome news to free-marketers, who thought the old deal was just a special-interest grab camouflaged as strategic trade policy. But it still leaves American chip makers with a potent legal tool for protection.
Successful electronics innovators recoup their enormous development costs by charging an arm and a leg for new products during the first few years of sales. Thus, when an American maker manages to extend the life of a technologically aging chip by discounting the price to just pennies more than the cost of the silicon wafer on which it is etched, textbooks call it good business.
But under American law, the price of imports must fully reflect overhead costs: When a foreign maker sells the same nearly obsolete chip at the same slender markup, courts are apt to call it dumping.
This double standard irritates America's trade partners, who define dumping as selling at lower prices abroad than at home. If the comatose global trade talks are ever resuscitated, Washington may be forced to sacrifice cost-based dumping restrictions in return for concessions to American exporters. But in the meantime, American chip makers will retain a potent import fighter.
Gary Saxonhouse, an economist at the University of Michigan, thinks there is more to worry about here than eccentric American dumping rules. The White House, he acknowledges, has made it harder to shut out imported chips. But there has been no change in the economic fundamentals that made the protection of semiconductors so fashionable in the mid-1980's.
"We thought we had discovered the escape route to the 21st century," Mr. Saxonhouse noted. Everyone expected that knowledge-based goods ranging from microprocessors to superconductors would replace more mundane industrial products as a source of high-paying jobs and export profits.
American exporters have, in fact, made a big comeback in world markets in the last few years. But ironically, the gains have been made the old-fashioned way, as manufacturers have learned to make middle-tech products, everything from chemicals to construction equipment, with less labor and energy. Japan continues to gain in the markets that were once the exclusive turf of companies like Intel and General Electric.
Denying Americans the chance to buy cheaper, better products because they are imported is not (and never was) the answer, Mr. Saxonhouse argues. But until somebody comes up with a better answer, America's future prosperity will hang in the balance.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Little Changed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed and interest rates were stable in sluggish trading yesterday.
"We are in a trend to higher yields," one government bond trader said, "but nobody is going to do anything until they see what the inflation numbers look like when they come out on Thursday and Friday." 
 With long-term yields hovering around 8.50 percent, traders said that there were rumors of money shifting from the equity market to bonds. Based on price movements, that sort of trade has not yet taken place.
"I would say you would need to have yields of 8 5/8 percent or more to generate that sort of move," the trader said.
Prices did slide briefly early in the day, but recovered later on.
"When you look at the last two or three trading sessions, it is clear the market is getting temporary support when yields reach certain levels, like 8 percent on five-year notes and 8.50 percent on bonds," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "But as we come to the end of the week, those levels will be challenged."
In keeping with the market's defensive psychology, most analysts are expecting that a raft of reports to be released tomorrow and Friday will provide further evidence that economic conditions improved in May, and that inflationary pressures increased somewhat. Statistics with that sort of cant are generally not well received by credit market participants.
A report showing that the United States ran its first quarterly current account surplus in nine years during the first three months of 1991 was ignored by traders. So too was testimony by Alan Greenspan, chairman of Federal Reserve Board. Mr. Greenspan, who appeared before the House Banking Committee, cited an increase in investors purchasing commercial property.
"Things are very quiet," the bond trader said.
 
The Secondary Market
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 96 1/4, up 1/32, to yield 8.47 percent, unchanged from late Monday.
Among note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 5/32, up 1/32, to yield 8.27 percent. The 7 5/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 98 23/32, unchanged on the day, to yield 7.94 percent. And the 6 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 19/ 32, down 1/32, to yield 6.97 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.55 percent, down three basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Meanwhile, six-month bill rates rose by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 5.77 percent.
Activity in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds remained very sluggish. Traders said that prices of most issues were unchanged on the day.
An announcement by Bridgeport, Conn., officials that the city plans to honor debt service payments on outstanding bonds despite Bridgeport's decision to file for bankruptcy protection had no discernible impact on prices of the city's outstanding securities, traders said.
Bridgeport, which announced last Thursday that it intended to seek protection from creditors under Chapter 9 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, has about $200 million of outstanding insured and uninsured bonds.
Elsewhere in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely quoted securities were unchanged on the day.

HEADLINE: Salvadoran Leader in the U.S. To Seek Continued Arms Aid

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
With negotiations aimed at ending his country's decade-long civil war momentarily stalled, President Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador began a three-day visit here today to press lawmakers and the Bush Administration for continued American military aid.
Hopes for a reasonably quick resolution to the war have dimmed in recent weeks with an upswing of violence that has prompted the Government and the guerrillas to accuse each other of bad-faith bargaining. 
 In an effort to press both sides to reach a peace accord by summer's end, House Democrats last week delayed placing any conditions on military aid to El Salvador at least until September. Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are weighing a similar move as they work on a State Department spending bill this week.
The Administration and Congress are on touchy ground in trying to nudge the bitter foes the last few steps to a final peace pact, but not push so hard as to drive them apart.
Congress last year gave the Administration only half of the $85 million in military aid it had requested for El Salvador. The remainder could be used only if President Bush determined that the rebels were not making a good effort to negotiate peace.
In response to a rebel downing of an American helicopter in January and the subsequent killing of two of its crewmen, the Administration said it had cause to release the additional aid, but has not yet done so pending the outcome of the peace talks.
Military action in El Salvador has been unusually intense for the rainy season, but neither side has showed any sign of backing away from the United Nations-sponsored peace talks. In fact, diplomats in Washington and San Salvador say optimism over a resolution is greater now than it has been in several years.
Mr. Cristiani is to meet with Mr. Bush and his advisers on Wednesday and with nearly three dozen Congressional leaders in the next two days.
The Salvadoran President, who was elected in 1989, is expected to emphasize the strides his administration is making in the peace talks and in reforming the military -- steps he hopes will head off a repeat of the restrictions Congress attached to military aid last year.
Against these claims of progress, American lawmakers will be watching to see how quickly and how aggressively the Government's prosecutes eight soldiers charged in the killing of six Jesuit priests in November 1989.
Mr. Cristiani, who traveled here with several of his top ministers, is also expected to appeal to President Bush to release the $42.5 million in military aid the Administration has withheld pending the outcome of the peace talks.
Lawmakers who oppose delivering the aid have urged the White House to hold firm. "Release of these funds would take the pressure off the Government with respect to the negotiations, the Jesuits case, and human rights generally," nine House Democrats said in a letter they sent to Mr. Bush last week.
The Salvadorans will also meet with officials from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, as well as private investors, to discuss increased economic aid and investment once a final peace accord is reached.

HEADLINE: Bailing Out Soviets: Bush Is Cautious

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
President Bush demonstrated again today that the game of diminished expectations can be played to advantage in diplomatic affairs as well as domestic politics.
 In fact, he and his Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, seem to have chosen that tactic as a continuing element in their approach to the knotty problem of relations with the new, multi-polar Soviet Union, which bears about as much resemblence to the old monolithic totalitarian state of Stalin and Brezhnev as television-era American politics do to those of Tammany Hall. 
 Having hinted for weeks that it strongly opposed inviting President Mikahil S. Gorbachev to the economic summit meeting in London in mid-July, and thus having dampened whatever plans Moscow may have had for stampeding Western leaders into early commitments of enormous financial aid, the Administration dropped its objections to Mr. Gorbachev coming to London next month.
 
Naming of Strauss
 Having said again and again that before settling into a new business relationship with Moscow he wanted more dramatic evidence of the Soviets' commitment to changes leading to a free-market economy, Mr. Bush chose Robert S. Strauss, a symbol of free-market trade if ever there was one, as his new Ambassador to the Soviet Union.
Casting aside doubts as to whether the feeble Soviet economy still meets the legal definition of a credit-worthy buyer, the President has now authorized the $1.5 billion in agricultural credits Mr. Gorbachev has been seeking, and he has committed himself to sending to Capitol Hill in the next week or so the enabling measure that would grant preferential trade terms to Moscow.
The effect of this flurry of activity, which has also included the clarification of disputed terms of the new treaty covering conventional forces in Europe, has been to assist the Soviet leader in significant ways while the Administration and Congress ponder the larger question of how much money the United States should provide to help rebuild the Soviet economy.
 
'Big Bang' Ruled Out
 Mr. Baker said in a speech in Copenhagen last week that the United States has ruled out the so-called "big bang" approach to helping Moscow.
In each case, Mr. Bush has made himself look more flexible, more generous, than he might have seemed had he not at first held back. Relatively small, relatively inexpensive symbolic acts have assumed added weight. That suits his purposes, because while he is eager to help Mr. Gorbachev, whom he greatly admires, he is not eager to commit the United States too deeply too quickly.
Resources are scarce. Demands for domestic spending are rising. But most important of all, even the very near-term future in the Soviet Union is hard to read. On Wednesday, for example, Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Gorbachev's principal rival, is likely to win election as President of the Russian republic, putting a skilled political operator with a popular mandate at the helm of the most important consitutent unit of the Soviet Union, with all that implies for Mr. Gorbachev, who has no such mandate.
If he wins, Washington expects a visit from Mr. Yeltsin, an earthy populist, sometime next week. Mr. Bush is reportedly planning to meet with him in the Oval Office -- an act that will be widely and probably correctly read as a hedging of bets. Further hedging will be needed until it is clear what is going to happen in the Baltic states, the republics in central Asia and those along the sensitive southern border of the Soviet Union, all of which have been growing restive.
 
Arms Talks Stalled
 It seems reasonable to ask now whether Mr. Bush is doing the same thing in the long-stalled strategic missile negotiations, which constitute the last major impediment to a summit meeting in Moscow this summer. The White House said on Monday that the meeting would probably have to be held in late July instead of late June, as originally envisioned. Did that reflect a genuine substantive hang-up, an attempt to bring pressure on the Soviets to soften their arms-reduction position in the hope that a Moscow meeting would bring more economic relief, or an attempt to make an eventual breakthrough look more dramatic? Perhaps a bit of each.
Few in Washington will be suprised, given the startling cascade of events in recent weeks, if an arms agreement suddenly emerges from one of Mr. Baker's talks with his Soviet counterpart, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, such as their meeting in Berlin next week. A summit date would almost surely be set shortly thereafter. But the Administration, ever loath to raise hopes too much, lest it appear to have failed, keeps talking about the difficult path ahead.
The agricultural credits are similar to those extended last December at a time when famine was a genuine threat in Soviet cities. Like those, they will cost the American taxpayer nothing unless Moscow defaults -- a major plus for the President, who can seem generous while not pushing himself further into a financial corner at home.
In the six months since December, even credits have become more controversial. The increasingly feeble Soviet economy makes a default seem more likely, and partisans of the Baltic states in this country, including Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican minority leader, have expressed fears that grain bought with the credits might be witheld from the Lithuanians and other critics of the Gorbachev Government. But they are less risky, Mr. Bush clearly concluded, than most other gestures currently available to him.

HEADLINE: U.S. Companies in Japan Say Things Aren't So Bad

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 11

 BODY:
American companies operating in Japan say they face far fewer trade restrictions than in previous years, a long-awaited American-sponsored study released today concludes. Surprisingly, it also says that they often benefit from Japan's much-criticized practice of organizing companies in tightly linked exclusive groups.
Many companies also enjoy far more lucrative returns here than at home, although it may take years to reach that level of performance. 
 The survey of more than 300 American companies was conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan and A. T. Kearney, a management consulting firm. Although there are a number of problems for American companies here, it notes, the overwhelming majority of respondents painted a far different picture of the trade and investment atmosphere in Japan than the one usually described by American officials as they press Japan to open its markets.
Word of the study's findings touched off considerable debate within the Bush Administration and among trade specialists, even before the report was made public today.
At a news conference here today, the authors of the study said there was a wide gap between the perceptions of American executives working in Japan and their counterparts at home, who view Japan as all but impenetrable.
"While many American managers believe it impossible to succeed in Japan," said Edmund J. Reilly, the head of the chamber and the president of the Digital Equipment Corporation's subsidiary here, "in reality, a growing number of American companies in the market have come to prosper."
Though Japan is the second-biggest economy in the industrialized world, said William J. Best, vice president and managing director of A. T. Kearney International Inc., "it is amazing to me when you talk to American companies back home how little they still know about the Japanese market. Japan is still not on the agenda."
 
How Tokyo Might React
 Chamber of Commerce officers said one goal of the report was to help draw more American companies to Japan and to convince them that many of the barriers of the 1960's and 70's have been swept away. "We have a hangover effect," Mr. Best said.
United States officials, who were briefed on the results of the report in recent weeks, have said privately that they are concerned that the report may be seized by the Japanese to support their arguments that there is little need for more change from Tokyo.
These were among the highlights of the study:
*About 22 percent of the companies said that within six years of being established, subsidiaries in Japan were able to exceed the profit margins of their American parent companies. Nearly three-quarters said they could exceed the parent company's margins in more than 10 years. Only 27 percent said it was not possible to exceed profits made at home.
*More than half those surveyed said their biggest impediment was the cost of doing business in Japan and of hiring workers in one of the world's tightest labor markets. Only a third said Japanese Government regulations were a major problem, although many financial-services companies said they faced significant restrictions. More than half cited as a problem the short-term management outlook of their own companies -- echoing a Japanese critique of American business.
*Although the United States has repeatedly protested to Japan about "keiretsu" -- the interlocking corporate structures that favor the goods of member companies and exclude outsiders -- 32 percent of the American companies said they had benefited from the keiretsu system, presumably because they are now members themselves; 44 percent said keiretsu had no effect on their trade and investment, and 24 percent said they had been hurt by keiretsu.
*Only 38 percent of the American concerns operating here manufacture goods in Japan, and fewer than half of those describe manufacturing as a "primary activity" in Japan. At a time when many technologies have migrated to Japan, 22 percent said research and development was a primary activity for them here.
*Only 11 percent of those operating here said "major restrictions" still hinder direct foreign investment in their industries; 44 percent said some restrictions exist, and about the same proportion said none exist.
"These are not statistics that will be well received in Washington, and we knew that," said an American executive in Tokyo who was influential in preparing the report and who insisted on anonymity. "But we concluded that there was a lot of outdated thinking going on about Japan today."
The survey, which was anonymous, included virtually all of the biggest American companies operating here and many smaller ones. It named the companies that other American corporations regard as successful in Japan: IBM Japan, which has 25,000 Japanese employees; Du Pont; DEC Japan and Texas Instruments. Coca-Cola was identified as a company with a huge and successful retail business here.
 
Two From Wall Street
 Among financial-services companies, two that built huge empires in Japan in the 1980's -- Goldman, Sachs and Salomon Brothers -- were also identified as highly successful.
The results will be presented in detail in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago soon, as part of an effort by the chamber here to draw more companies to Japan. The Commerce Department recently began a similar program, planning to work with 20 American companies, but top executives of many of them dropped out at the last minute.
One reason, perhaps, that the results seem unusually positive, is that the more successful American companies in Japan were more likely to complete the detailed survey, which has an industry-by-industry appendix. The survey had a 40 percent response rate in Japan, with answers from 293 of 732 American operations surveyed here. The survey was sent to 479 companies in the United States but only 10 percent responded. To try to balance the results, many of the companies in the United States were interviewed, including a number that had failed in Japan.
Also, the respondents tended to be those with long experience here; more than 200 had begun operating here before or during the 1970's.
 
A Matter of Definition
 One difficulty in interpreting the results is that many companies have different definitions, including, for example, what constitutes a keiretsu. Technically, the term applies to well-defined groups of companies that are centered on a trading firm and a bank, like the giant Mitsubishi group. But it is commonly used generally to describe the tight relationships that often govern the conduct of business in Japan.
Another factor to consider is that the companies were asked to compare their financial results with their own expectations, rather than to objective measures. "A lot of companies here have diminished expectations," said one executive who was previously a trade official.
Some of the conclusions reached in the survey were familiar to readers of past studies. Executives said that it took longer to become a success in Japan than in virtually any other country. Many companies still refuse to modify their products for Japanese tastes -- the American auto makers were a frequently cited example -- because of the costs entailed. About half said that a big problem was Japan's strict product-quality requirements.
The complaint heard most often involved Japan's complex and carefully controlled distribution system. A huge proportion -- 84 percent -- said Tokyo's procurement practices still greatly favored Japanese concerns.
Many of the respondents were computer makers and construction and insurance companies.

HEADLINE: Weicker Says New Budget Is Compromise

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 11

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. presented today what he called a compromise budget that he said included the best thinking from the legislature and the administration on how to resolve the state's revenue crisis.
But he left intact most of the core provisions and demands, including the income tax on wages, that have led the two branches of government to reject the other's best thinking so far. 
 Lawmakers resoundingly defeated the Governor's initial budget and last month he in turn vetoed their plan. This threw the state into a special legislative session and a race to pass a budget before the start of the fiscal year on July 1.
 
Room for Tinkering
 In presenting his revised plan at a news conference today at the Capitol, Mr. Weicker was both conciliatory and confrontational. He stressed that his revised budget had lots of room for give and take and suggested that lawmakers could do a good deal of tinkering without provoking another veto. But he also warned that he would vigorously oppose any effort to stretch budget talks past July 1, saying state residents will know who to hold responsible for the jarring cuts in services that could result if no budget is passed.
"If we don't, it's because we've chosen not to get ourselves out of the hole," Mr. Weicker said.
A third-party governor with no allies in the legislature, Mr. Weicker stunned lawmakers in February when he suggested imposing what the state has avoided for decades: an income tax on wages. His initial plan would have collected a flat 6 percent of all adjusted gross income above $12,500 for an individual or $25,000 for a couple filing jointly.
 
Revised Plan's Bigger Bite
 The revised plan would take an even bigger bite and collect an additional $115 million by raising the top rate to 6.75 percent. That rate would start at $24,500 for an individual, $40,000 for a head of a household filing alone and $49,000 for a couple filing jointly.
It would simultaneously lower the rate to 5.75 percent for the lowest income brackets, starting at $12,500 for an individual, $20,000 for a head of household and $25,000 for a couple. The old plan would have lowered the state's 8 percent sales tax, the highest statewide rate in the nation, to 4.25 percent. Under the new plan, the rate would be 4.5 percent.
The further tax increases, on top of what had already been by far the largest proposed one-year tax increase in state history, were mandated by the state's worsening economy and falling tax collections, Mr. Weicker said. "Since February, we have seen a precipitous deterioration in the economic condition," he said. "This state is bleeding -- and badly."
The revised plan includes many of the spending-control measures included in the vetoed legislative budget. The Governor said he would also agree to a provision that would give the income tax -- the entire revenue system, in fact -- a shelf life of only three years before it would expire on June 30, 1994.
Lawmakers said they expected no stampede to embrace the revised plan.
"It's a step forward in some respects, but it's also a step back," said Senator James H. Maloney, a Danbury Democrat against the income tax who helped lead the charge to defeat Mr. Weicker's first budget.
Mr. Maloney said that while Mr. Weicker's acceptance of the spending ceilings was a positive move, the public and the legislature should be disturbed that the lowered sales tax rate, a main element in selling the income tax, had risen.
"It shows that the imposition of an income tax does not guarantee a permanently lowered sales tax," he said. "It's already starting to creep back up."
The coalition budget of which Mr. Maloney is a co-author would have kept the sales tax at 8 percent and extended it to hundreds of millions of dollars in new transactions to resolve the nearly $2 billion shortfall expected in the preliminary $8.6 billion spending plan for next year. In his veto message, Mr. Weicker called that anti-business and cruel to the poor.
Mr. Weicker's new budget also extends his repeated objections to what he calls budget gimmicks. The legislature's plan, for instance, would have transferred the Department of Motor Vehicles from the general fund budget to a separate transportation fund, for a savings of $51 million. Mr. Weicker said today that the savings were illusory because the department's operations costs would just come from a less visible fund.
Mr. Weicker called that a gimmick and put the motor vehicles department back on the general fund budget. For the same reason, he also rejected a postponement of a payment to the state's teacher retirement fund that would have saved money only in the short run. The combined changes put his new $7.4 billion budget almost $400 million at odds with the legislative spending plan that many Republicans, in particular, had identified as inviolate, regardless of how the tax questions were settled.

HEADLINE: BUSH BACKS LOANS FOR SOVIET FARMS WORTH $1.5 BILLION

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
President Bush approved $1.5 billion in agricultural loan guarantees for the Soviet Union today, a major step toward helping President Mikhail S. Gorbachev bolster his country's economy.
The loan guarantees, which Mr. Bush had recently indicated he would approve after extending $1 billion in similar credits last December, will be made available in three installments starting this month with $600 million, said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman. 
 The guarantees will allow American banks to lend money to the Soviet Union to buy badly needed farm products, primarily feed grain, with the assurance that the Federal Government would repay the money if Moscow defaulted.
 
Waiting for Results
 By month's end, Mr. Bush is also expected to send to Congress a Soviet-American trade agreement that was signed at the last full-scale Soviet-American summit meeting here in June, 1990. The accord had been kept on his desk until the Soviet Union passed a new emigration law. But a senior official said Mr. Bush could forward the document to the Senate as early as this week.
The treaty would remove the last barriers to granting the Soviet Union the tariffs extended to other friendly nations and is seen by Moscow as a critical first step toward expanding its economic contacts with the United States as well as the other industrial democracies.
The loan guarantees and the preparations to send the trade agreement to Congress represented an effort by Mr. Bush to begin to fulfill his promise to help Mr. Gorbachev institute economic reform. They also continue an active but not officially acknowledged effort to bolster the Soviet leader politically, while Mr. Bush makes up his mind how much direct financial aid he would be willing to extend to the Soviet Union.
 
'Positive Evolution'
 "The President's decision reflects the Administration's desire to promote a continued positive evolution in the U.S.-Soviet relationship," Mr. Fitzwater said in announcing the loan guarantees.
They were also part of a group of decisions that Mr. Bush has recently faced as he and Mr. Gorbachev move to clear up arms-control and trade issues in advance of a planned summit in Moscow this summer.
In a cable he sent to Mr. Gorbachev today about the loan guarantees, Mr. Bush also told the Soviet leader that he was assembling a team of experts to look into ways to develop a food distribution system for a country where food shortages are generally ascribed to a built-in inability to bring produce to consumers, not to lack of production.
"All of this is sort of a holding action while the President makes the far harder decisions about direct financial aid," an Administration official said. He added, "We help the Soviets a little on trade while they, we hope, work out the arms control problems we still have, and everything moves forward in the relationship."
Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Bush directed Agriculture Secretary Edward Madigan to begin immediate discussions with Soviet officials about the details of the loan guarantees. After the first installment of $600 million, $500 million more would be available in October. A final $400 million would be available next February.
The guarantees will be good only for purchases of American products, but other details of the loans, including interest rates, are left to negotiations between Moscow and American banks.
 
Moscow's History on Debts
 Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Bush, who is required by law to certify that the Soviet Union is capable of repaying loans before issuing Federal guarantees, based his decision on Moscow's history on debts to the United States.
"They have never defaulted on an official loan involving this country," Mr. Fitzwater said. "The President has discussed this with other experts and it is his conclusion that they do meet the test of credit worthiness and that they can and will repay the loans."
The President also acted on an assessment by a team of American specialists that the Soviet Union needs the loan guarantees to get through next winter and on "assurances from the Soviet Government that grain made available through the credit guarantees would be fairly distributed among the Soviet republics and the Baltic states," Mr. Fitzwater said.
Mr. Fitzwater said the money was broken up into three installments for accounting reasons; the Commodity Credit Corporation has already committed $4.2 billion of the $5 billion in guarantees available to it for fiscal 1991.
But Administration officials said that making the guarantees in segments would also permit Washington to monitor the distribution of grain purchased from the United States. If they are not fairly distributed, Mr. Fitzwater said, the United States "will have direct discussions with the Soviet leadership on that situation."
But he did not directly link the additional installments to that question, and officials said in private that the only recourse the United States would have if the food was not fairly distributed was to cut off the additional guarantees, a punitive move that they considered unlikely, given Mr. Bush's general reluctance to use economic sanctions as a political lever.
In a prepared statement that he read to reporters in the White House briefing room, Mr. Fitzwater sought to link the credit guarantees to a broader effort by Mr. Bush to use his personal relationship with Mr. Gorbachev to persuade the Soviet leader to institute free-market reforms.
"In addition to meeting the Soviet request for credit guarantees, the President today also expressed to President Gorbachev his continued interest in collaborating on a long-term effort to improve the food distribution system in the U.S.S.R., primarily through the introduction of market measures."
He added, "The United States is prepared to form a high-level team of Government and private experts to assist the Soviets in this effort."
Mr. Fitzwater said the makeup of that team was not decided and that there were no specific commitments by Mr. Gorbachev to remove centralized controls from Soviet agriculture or any other part of his country's economy.
"The President," he said, "has had a number of conversations with President Gorbachev in which he has emphasized his commitment to make changes in the system, to move toward a market economy."
Asked why Mr. Bush had agreed to help the Soviet Union buy more food if its primary problem was not one of production but distribution, Mr. Fitzwater said the loan guarantees were mainly intended to help the Soviet Union purchase feed grain for use at farms, not consumer food to fill empty store shelves.
"Without being able to purchase those feed grains from United States farmers, they could well have very serious shortages in those areas," Mr. Fitzwater said.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 10.51; 3,000 Mark Topped Briefly

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
After briefly surpassing the 3,000 barrier yesterday morning, the Dow Jones industrial average ended the day with a gain of 10.51 to close at 2,985.69.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange rose to 161.6 million shares, from 127.7 million on Monday. 
 While 865 issues advanced and 693 declined, the blue-chip stocks again accounted for much of the gain in the Dow industrials and the 2.48 rise in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, to 381.05.
The Big Board's composite index closed up by 1.09, at 208.83, while the Nasdaq composite index rose by 0.77, to 496.62.
"We are still in a bull market that is merely gathering strength for its next major advance," said Steven G. Einhorn, portfolio strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "There are three reasons for our view: The economy is improving, however slowly; the inflation rate is low, and the Federal Reserve is friendly."
Mr. Einhorn said, however, that the market's sluggish behavior could be pegged to three reasons: Prices of long-term Treasury bonds have tumbled with the accompanying rise in interest rates; there has been a sharp decline in institutional cash reserves, and the volume of new stock offerings has been running at near-record levels.
Indeed, a secondary offering of 17.5 million nonvoting Reader's Digest Association shares propelled the stock to second place on the Big Board's most active list. The shares were sold at $33.25 each by 10 stockholder associations, with none of the proceeds going to the company. The stock closed up by 1 1/4, at 34 1/2, on a turnover of three million shares.
The most active issue was Pepsico Inc., which rose 1/4, to 30 1/2, on a volume of almost 3.2 million shares. Brokers said the only news on Pepsico was that its candidate for a seat on the board of the American Business Computer Corporation declined to accept the offer.
Pepsico owns two million of American Business Computer's 13.5 million shares and is entitled to a seat on the company's board.
 
Active Wal-Mart Up 1 1/8
 Elsewhere among the most active Big Board issues, price changes were in fractions either way with the notable exception of Wal-Mart Stores, which has been enjoying good sales. Wal-Mart rose 1 1/8, to 43 1/8, and was the 10th-most-active issue, on a turnover of 1.4 million shares.
Trading was also listless at the American Stock Exchange, where its market-value index edged up 0.03, to 369.80, and volume rose to 10.1 million shares, from 9.7 million on Monday.

HEADLINE: After Boom and Bust, Denver Enters Big Leagues

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DENVER, June 11

 BODY:
While difficult for some to fathom, the organized play of costumed young men, who spit tobacco and scratch where it itches, adds a cosmopolitan flair to any American metropolis. Major-league baseball will soon confer that distinction upon Denver.
But even before the news on Monday that baseball will come to Denver as soon as the team owners take a formal vote, this old city at the edge of the Rocky Mountains was poised for a civic transformation. After going from cowtown to boomtown to bust, Denver is ready to come of age as a diverse, all-purpose city, with all the virtues and vices of urban America. 
 A new airport, one of the world's biggest, is to open in 1994, a year after the baseball team arrives. A huge new convention center has recently been completed. United Airlines is considering opening a vast maintenance center here that would employ 30,000 workers.
"Denver is being remade before our eyes," said Phillip Burgess, executive director of the Center for The New West, a research organization. "But people have been so caught up in the transformation that there isn't a real unified vision of where we're going."
The city's come-hither demeanor toward baseball and major employers like United stands in stark contrast to the heady, almost arrogant days of the early 70's, when Colorado voters, hoping to limit growth, rejected a bid for the Winter Olympics.
The challenge facing the city today, it seems, is to nurture a stable, manageable growth and yet avoid the traumas of the boom-and-bust rollercoaster. To find the right road, the city faces the difficult task of organizing a civic leadership, drawing an agenda and attracting the kind of decent, dependable jobs that guarantee residents a stake in the future.
Eight years after Federico Pena was elected as the city's first Hispanic mayor, the city's voters on Tuesday will choose between two black men to succeed him. Nearly seven decades after a member of the Ku Klux Klan was governor here and 20 years after school integration efforts led to racial strife, the transfer of the mayorality from Mr. Pena, who did not run for re-election, to a black man is seen by many here as a sign that this city has matured as a diverse urban center.
Almost a quarter of the population of 467,000 is Hispanic, making up the only major ethnic group showing steady growth. The others include some 58,000 blacks, maintaining a steady level since 1980, and a white population that has dropped about 4 percent since 1980 to 287,000.
The two candidates in the nonpartisan election -- Norm Early, the state's attorney, and Wellington Webb, the city auditor -- face worsening street-gang violence, the loss of its middle-class residents to the suburbs, a dearth of water and a haze of pollution hanging over the city that locals have nicknamed the "brown cloud."
 
From Boom to Careful Reflection
 For the past several years, Denver has not cut a prominent figure on the national scene. Following the boom-and-bust cycle of the 1970's and 1980's, it has been a time for the city to dust itself off and look both ways before crossing new avenues.
In the oil boom, Denver sustained a nearly mythic image, a place where entrepreneurs and developers, and not a few hucksters, came to town with billfolds open for quick profits. The ethos of growth and greed inspired, in an exaggerated form, the television series "Dynasty."
By 1986, the boom had fallen silent. And many homeowners suddenly carried deeds to houses worth tens of thousands of dollars less than when they had purchased them.
Many of the high rollers who came to Denver in the boom, including Bill Walters, the developer, and Marvin Davis, the oilman, left town soon after the party ended.
In Denver, boom has become a four-letter expletive, at least the kind of boom associated with quick growth and flimsy financing. The economic gospel of today preaches measured progress, stability, diversity.
The leading employer in the metropolitan region is U S West, one of the regional telephone companies, which counts about 13,000 workers in the region. Martin Marietta Corporation, the aerospace company, employs about that many workers. In recent years, several companies have placed telecommunications centers in the region, among them a division of American Express.
In an effort to broaden its base, the city and state have offered more than $320 million in incentives to United Airlines for the proposed maintenance center. Politicians have said the center would provide the kind of steady work base the city needs.
 
Diffuse Leadership
 But the Denver region has comparatively few major companies with headquarters here. And the absence of such corporate leaders, in the view of many Denverites, has meant a vacuum of civic leadership.
"The leadership of Denver tends to be diffuse, fragmented," said John Welles, executive director of the Museum of Natural History. "In Dallas or Minneapolis, if you want to get something done, you can get 20 or 30 people together for a meeting and make things happen. We can't do that. And I think perhaps that's because we're not a headquarters town."
Coordinated or not, Denver has been moving on several fronts. The most notable has been the apparent success in winning a baseball franchise. The largest single investor for the team is the Adolph Coors Corporation, the company based in suburban Golden known for its beer.
Like many American cities, an increasing affluence in the suburbs parallels worsening economic woes in the inner city. Almost all of the new corporate towers have been sprouting on suburban soil, mostly in the prosperous suburbs south of the city. The new airport, as well as the proposed United maintenance base, to be built northeast of the city, follow the suburban trend.
From 1970 to 1980, the Denver region saw a population growth of 24 percent. It grew 12 percent more in the past 10 years. Suburban Douglas County grew by 140 percent in the past decade, faster than all but Flager County in northern Florida. The Denver region now has about 1.8 million residents.
But the city itself saw population losses of 4.3 percent in the 1970's and 5 percent in the 1980's. And the city has yet to completely stem the loss of its middle class, which hemorrhaged with "white flight" after a Federal court ordered busing in 1974 to achieve racial integration.
In the recent mayoral campaign, in which two of the three leading candidates were black, race was almost never mentioned. The white candidate, Don Bain, a prominent lawyer here, finished third. Mr. Early, the frontrunner in the primary, now faces Mr. Webb in the run-off on Tuesday.
"I think the mayoral campaign has shown how Denver has really matured as a city of many cultures, especially in light of the clashes we saw over school integration in the 70's," said William H. Hornby, the 68-year-old former editor of the Denver Post, who now writes a column for the newspaper.
"Part of that owes to the kind of people who move here," he added. "They tend to be younger, well-educated people, who are open to new ideas. And often, they've often come from other large cities. And they're determined to see that things are better here."
These days, Denverites seem to have a palpable desire to show the nation that this is an exciting prosperous city, not a remote Western outpost.
But a tourism consultant hired recently by the city has urged Denver to make the most of its cowtown history and culture, rather than try to erect a miniature Chicago or New York.
"In Denver, you sometimes get the impression that they're ashamed of the cowtown legacy," said Jane Siegel, a senior associate of Longwood International, the tourism consultant in Toronto that conducted a study for Denver. "But that's what makes a place like Denver so distinctive."

HEADLINE: U.S. Bailout For Banks Predicted

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
The nation's senior auditor said today that the banking industry might be headed for a large taxpayer bailout.
Some members of Congress and analysts of the nation's commercial and savings bank industry have made such warnings before. But the prediction by the Comptroller General, Charles A. Bowsher, is significant because he is widely considered the most credible impartial voice in Government. His early assessments of the problems of savings and loan institutions and later of the huge costs in that bailout have proved prophetic. 
 Mr. Bowsher, speaking to reporters after appearing before a Congressional committee, did not suggest how large a bailout might be needed, but even the most pessimistic assessments have not seen the need for anything like the costly effort that is being made to salvage savings and loans. The Administration estimates that the savings bailout will cost taxpayers $130 billion, but Mr. Bowsher has said the total could be as high as $500 billion over 40 years.
 
Replenishing the Fund
 Bailing out the banking industry would involve replenishing the Government insurance fund that protects deposits and is used to cover the cost of bank failures. The fund has been battered by the growing number of large bank failures and is now at its lowest level since it was created in 1934.
Mr. Bowsher's latest assessment, which follows increasingly gloomy predictions and dire numbers about the state of the banking industry and the insurance fund, did not come totally as a surprise because he had previously urged Congress to provide some additional money for the fund.
"The odds are strong that the taxpayers are going to end up having to pay money to shore up the insurance fund," said Representative Charles Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, a member of the House Banking Committee. "But most of Congress would prefer to avoid the issue.
"I think Bowsher has been on target because he doesn't have an ax to grind."
Officials in the banking industry reacted differently to Mr. Bowsher's assessment.
Edward Yingling of the American Bankers Association, the largest trade group for the industry, said that if the recession ends soon, "this is a problem that can be handled by the industry, and it's our intention to do it within the industry."
Charlotte LeGates, a spokeswoman for the National Council of Savings Institutions, a trade group of about 350 banks and savings associations, said: "It's not clear how bad the banking industry's problems will be, but they will be very bad. It's not at all clear that the banks will be able to pay back if extremely large sums of money are borrowed."
The Treasury Department said today, as it has before, that no taxpayer bailout of the banking industry would be necessary if Congress adopted its plan to reorganize the industry and eliminate barriers to bank expansion into new businesses and across state lines.
Mr. Bowsher's prediction was prompted in part by a report issued today by bank regulators that while 90 percent of the nation's savings and commercial banks posted profits for the first three months of this year, the total size of banks with troubled loans had increased significantly, to $418 billion, from $399.7 billion less than three months ago.
On Monday, L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, once again raised his estimate of losses to the fund that protects bank deposits, to as much as $23.1 billion over the next 18 months, up from $14 billion. Mr. Seidman said today that most of the losses were more likely to occur in 1992, but denied that regulators were postponing the closing of ailing banks because the fund was so low.
The timing and political content of Mr. Bowsher's remarks are noteworthy. In April he called on Congress to impose cash assessments on the banking industry to shore up the insurance fund with $15 billion in cash. Neither the bankers nor Congress have rallied to this call, and it has also been denounced by the Bush Administration and senior regulators.
By raising the specter of a bank bailout, Mr. Bowsher was reminding Congress and the White House that he sounded similar warnings in the 1980's on savings and loans.
The bank fund has been depleted by a growing number of large bank failures, the latest of which was the Bank of New England, whose failure in January could ultimately cost the fund $2.5 billion.
Worried about the imminent insolvency of the bank insurance fund, the Bush Administration earlier this year asked Congress to overhaul the banking system and permit regulators to borrow up to $70 billion to protect depositors and shut down bankrupt institutions. The package threatens to become bogged down in Congress in the next few weeks, and today President Bush met with senior Democrats and Republicans from the House to push his legislation.
Treasury officials have said the prospective loans to the insurance fund will be repaid from industry contributions and the sale of assets from the failed banks.
But Mr. Bowsher told reporters after appearing before a Congressional committee that "it is far from certain" that the Government would be repaid under the Administration's proposal. "Some people have given the impression that Treasury's loans will all be repaid," Mr. Bowsher said. "I don't think that it is a foregone conclusion that they will be repaid."
In an interview this evening, Mr. Bowsher said he could not estimate how much a bank bailout would ultimately cost taxpayers.
"I can't quantify how much it will cost because we can't quantify how much the insurance fund will actually be borrowing," he said. "The regulators and Treasury have not been forthcoming with what they expect to borrow. But I don't think we should kid ourselves into thinking that the taxpayers will ultimately not be called upon."
Mr. Seidman had based his original estimates on a "short and shallow" recession and turnaround in the economy by summer. The consensus of Government and private economists is that the economy is fulfilling this prediction and is in the process of pulling out of the recession.
 
A Real Estate Recession
 Asked at a news conference about the fact that he had revised his prediction about the banks despite the apparent recovery of the economy, Mr. Seidman said: "What we're finding out is that there are two recessions. One is the general recession and the other is the real estate recession. We have not yet seen enough recovery in the real estate recession and that has the most important effect on the banks. We simply have not seen a recovery yet that is affecting the banking industry."
For the first three months of this year, the nation's 12,246 commercial banks posted profits of about $5.7 billion, compared with $1.1 billion in the prior quarter and $6.2 billion in the first quarter of 1990. The 463 federally insured savings banks posted losses of $170 million for the first quarter, compared with a loss of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of last year and a loss of $257 million for the first quarter of 1990.
Assets at troubled institutions continued to grow over the first three months of this year more rapidly than the two cushions used to absorb losses -- the amount of capital banks have raised and the amount they have placed in reserve in anticipation of losses. The F.D.I.C. said that troubled loans grew by $7.2 billion at the same time that capital increased by only $4.4 billion and reserves shrank by almost $500 million.
The actual value of the bank insurance fund is in dispute. Mr. Seidman has said the fund was worth about $8.4 billion at the end of last year. But Mr. Bowsher has said the fund is "virtually insolvent" because of the likely number of bank failures.
Mr. Seidman said there was little sign that the commercial real estate markets would turn around soon, and as a result, he expected 100 more bank failures from now to the end of 1992 over his earlier estimate of about 340 banks.
 
Greenspan More Optimistic
 A slightly more optimistic outlook on the commercial real estate outlook was suggested today by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Questioned at a hearing of the House Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan said that one indication that the markets might be turning around was that regulators had been noticing "the beginnings of what we call bottom fishing" by investors purchasing commercial property.
In his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Bowsher suggested that Congress consider separating into two posts the functions of chairman of the F.D.I.C. and chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation, which oversees the savings bailout. Mr. Seidman, who under the law setting up the rescue effort holds both positions, is expected to step down this fall, and Mr. Bowsher said that might be an opportune time for the change.
The committee was given a report today by the General Accounting Office that detailed a host of problems at the trust corporation, which are expected to add billions of dollars to the overall costs of the bailout. On Monday, Resolution Trust reported that it had lost $6.4 billion more than anticipated for 1990, primarily because of a higher-than-estimated loss in fees to contractors and the sharp discounts offered for sales of assets including loans, real estate and "junk bonds."
The report prompted some lawmakers to suggest that Congress completely overhaul Resolution Trust when it considers providing new funds for the agency in the next few months.
But Mr. Bowsher cautioned against making too dramatic a change, saying that after two years, the trust corporation had made some progress in setting up a system for seizing insolvent savings associations and disposing of their assets.

HEADLINE: U.S. Posts a Trade Surplus From Gulf War Payments

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
The United States had a foreign trade surplus of $10.2 billion in the first three months of this year, the first quarterly surplus in almost nine years, the Government said today.
The Commerce Department attributed the surplus in the broadest measure of foreign trade, called the current account, to $22.7 billion in cash received during the first quarter from Saudi Arabia, Japan and other countries to help pay the costs of the Persian Gulf war. 
 Because of the war contributions, economists are forecasting that the current account deficit for the whole year should narrow to about $40 billion, far below the $92.12 billion deficit last year.
 
Gains Seen for U.S. Goods
 In addition to the contributions, the imbalance in the current account is expected to be narrowed by further gains in sales of American exports.
The current account is the broadest measure of trade because it includes not only trade in merchandise but also investment flows between countries and earnings on tourism and other services.
The $10.2 billion surplus was the first positive trade flow for the United States since a $3.61 billion surplus in the second quarter of 1982.
During the 1980's, the trade deficit soared to record levels as billions of dollars were sent abroad to pay for imported cars and television sets. That money returned to the United States in the form of foreign investments, transforming the nation from the world's largest creditor nation to the largest debtor country.
 
One Gap Shrinks
 For the first three months of the year, the country had a deficit of $18.37 billion in merchandise trade, the smallest deficit in this category in nearly eight years. The improvement in merchandise trade came as the recession dampened demand for imports while sales of American exports hit an all-time high.
Offsetting the merchandise trade deficit was a $6.99 billion surplus on services, a category that includes such things as foreign tourist spending in the United States. The United States also ran a surplus o $4.65 billion on investment income, indicating that Americans earned more on their foreign holdings than foreigners earned on their American investments during the first quarter.
The category known as unilateral transfers, including the foreign payments for the gulf operations, was in surplus by $16.94 billion in the first three months of the year. The cash contributions from the allies were offset somewhat by Washington's foreign aid payments and Social Security payments to retired Americans living overseas.

Democrats Attack Bush Over 100-Day Deadline

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
Short of a legislative miracle, Congress will not pass transportation and crime bills by Friday. And no one seems more gleeful at the prospect that the lawmakers will not meet President Bush's personal challenge to act on his two most pressing domestic priorities in 100 days than the President himself.
Mr. Bush has scheduled a nationwide address from the White House grounds Wednesday night to chastise Congress for inaction. In case people do not see that or do not get the message, he plans to repeat it Friday at a commencement address at the California Institute of Technology. 
 As a onetime House member, Mr. Bush knows that lawmakers do not take well to deadlines, especially when they come from the White House. It does not take a cynic to suggest that his timetable was imposed as a public relations stunt.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, denied that Mr. Bush was playing politics.
"Crime and transportation are extremely important and 100 days should have been enough time to pass legislation," Mr. Fitzwater said, adding, "I don't want to get into a political fight."
Whatever the President's intentions, a political fight is exactly what erupted today on Capitol Hill. Congressional leaders testily denounced the President, while House Republicans mocked their Democratic colleagues by sporting black-and-white buttons with the legend "100 Days."
The squabbling started when Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, sounded unusually fierce as he suggested that Mr. Bush was behind "a new low in political cynicism."
"This 100-day business, the so-called 100-day deadline, is a completely arbitrary date picked by the President for what has become clear are political reasons," Mr. Mitchell added, spitting out each word. "It was established for the sole purpose of scoring political points."
Then he proceeded to propose a deadline of his own on Mr. Bush. He chided the President for not developing an adequate health care package after 872 days in office and challenged him to propose one in the next month. "I would suggest that before the 900th day of his Presidency he should submit to Congress his plan for dealing with one of the most serious, widespread problems facing the country," Mr. Mitchell said.
At lunchtime, Speaker Thomas S. Foley weighed in, with something more like his customary control.
"It is really, with great respect, not the President's business to attempt to organize the schedule of the Congress," he asserted. "I hope it is not just a political gimmick and the beginning of a period of 1992 Presidential campaigns that are centered around Congress bashing."
The bashing only escalated in Representative Newt Gingrich's response to the Democrats: "Senator Mitchell ought to go out and talk to the 6,500 families who were murder victims in the last 100 days. He ought to talk to the 40,500 women who were raped. He ought to talk to the 330,000 victims of robbery."
"I don't think they think it is cynical for the President to try to emulate Franklin Roosevelt and set some kind of deadline," said Mr. Gingrich, the House Republican whip.
When Mr. Bush addressed a joint session of Congress on March 6 after the end of the war in the Persian Gulf, he challenged Congress to act swiftly on transportation and crime legislation. "If our forces could win the ground war in 100 hours, then surely Congress can pass this legislation in 100 days," Mr. Bush said.
Told of Mr. Mitchell's comments about the 100-day deadline, Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., a Wisconsin Republican, said: "His partisan slip is showing. When Franklin Roosevelt gave Congress a 100-day deadline for all of the anti-Depresssion measures following his inauguration in 1933, nobody complained that it was a cynical partisan effort."
Times, of course, are different. And so are intentions, as James A. Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University, sees it.
A number of Mr. Roosevelt's measures were enacted to help restore confidence in the economy. Passage of legislation was never Mr. Bush's prime motivation, he says.
"Congress was not created to be efficient but to be representative," Mr. Thurber said. "When you press an institution to meet a deadline, it's easy for them to miss the deadline and easy for the President to blame them. It's a pretty good strategy on his part."

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
AGASSAC, Angelus, Angludet, Ausone . . .
"Back in the mid-1960's, my wife and I took up Bordeaux reds." Thus began a letter from a Connecticut reader that outlined a most unusual wine odyssey. The letter went on: 
 "Early on, we began a tradition of having a red Bordeaux chateau every Saturday at noon, choosing food (even pizzas) that tended to work well with a Bordeaux red. We've been so regular in this custom that by now we've enjoyed over 600 chateaus."
Beau-Site, Belair, Beychevelle, Brane-Cantenac . . .
Six hundred Bordeaux chateaus! How many Bordeaux chateau owners could match that: their own and 599 others? How many enologists, wine makers, growers, merchants or wine writers could make that claim?
The two heroic Bordeaux fans are Robert L. and Frances McLaughlin, of Cheshire, Conn., about halfway between New Haven and Hartford. He is an economic forecaster who publishes Turning Points, a newsletter; she, a high-school English teacher.
Cabannieux, Calon-Segur, Cheval Blanc, Clerc-Milon . . .
"I was strictly a six-pack beer man in my younger days," Mr. McLaughlin said in a telephone interview. "It was after I got my M.A. at Syracuse and was married that I first got into wine. Some of our Syracuse friends were teachers, and I remember them always bringing out the sherry. One fellow surprised us with a bottle of red wine. I'll never forget it; it was from Almaden.
"Once, on a trip to New York, I walked into the Sherry-Lehmann wine store. I told the clerk I liked the idea of trying something French. He recommended Chateau Gruaud-Larose. I brought it home and we had it that Saturday and it was better than a chocolate malted. That was my first real introduction to great wine. Oh yes, the Gruaud was a 1964."
Dassault, Dauzac, Desmirail, Doisy-Daene . . .
The Gruaud-Larose should have begun a beautiful friendship but it wasn't that easy. The McLaughlins were disappointed in many wines they tried in the early days. "We were in our early 30's," he recalled, "and we were buying mostly cheap stuff. I can remember saying to my wife that de Gaulle must have been sending us all the junk. We'd never even heard of tannin."
Tannins are astringent substances that come from the skins and seeds of grapes and give structure and longevity to the best wines. When the wines are young they can taste harsh.
Eglise, Enclos, Escadre, Evangile . . .
The McLaughlins have made their Bordeaux drinking into a pleasant ritual. Saturday lunch -- outdoors in summer -- is planned around that week's chateau. While drinking the week's selection, they pore over their collection of Bordeaux books, reading about the wine and comparing it with others they recall from the same Bordeaux region or commune.
"With Feret, Johnson, Parker, Peppercorn, Penning-Rowsell and Hubrecht Duijker, you can really have fun on a Saturday, studying the one chateau you're drinking that day," Mr. McLaughlin said, referring to some of the better texts.
Their Bordeaux bible is the huge 1,867-page "Bordeaux and Its Wines," published in Bordeaux by Feret et Fils and known throughout the wine world simply as Feret. Now in its 13th edition, Feret can be traced back to the first major Bordeaux reference work, "Bordeaux, Its Wines and the Claret Country," published in 1846 in London by Charles Cox. "We pick our wines out of Feret," Mr. McLaughlin said, "then buy them at our favorite wine shop in Hamden, Bob and Ben's."
Bob and Ben's is more formally known as Mount Carmel Wines and Liquors, but not to the McLaughlins. "Bob and Ben's is a fantastic place," he said. "They have a magnificent selection." Often, when his choice from Feret is not available, Bob McLaughlin lets himself be steered to something that is, like the 1987, and later the 1988, Chateau La Lagune.
Figeac, Filhot, Fourcas-Hosten, Franc-Mayne . . .
As they forge ahead through Feret, the McLaughlins still find time to revisit old favorites. "I'd say we're on a five-year cycle with the classified growths," he said. The classified growths are the 61 wines selected by the Bordeaux brokers in 1855 for a fair in Paris and classified by them. These are among the top Bordeaux wines, starting with the five first growths, including Chateaux Latour, Margaux and Lafite-Rothschild.
The McLaughlins do enjoy other wines, but usually in restaurants. Recently they have been drinking more California wines. "For years, we were opposed to California reds," Mr. McLaughlin said. "But in recent years, we think they've improved. And we're actually drinking some of them, mostly in restaurants."
Gaffeliere, Giscours, Gloria, Greysac . . .
In spite of their unalterable loyalty to Bordeaux, the McLaughlins sense a loss of quality in recent years. "Bordeaux in the past few years has gone downhill," Mr. Mclaughlin said. "We used to enjoy so many chateaus that had full bodies, almost a syrupy thickness. We rarely find them anymore. We're also surprised by the lack of complexity. We think Bordeaux is made now for quicker drinking. It simply isn't as good as it used to be."
That does not mean for an instant that the McLaughlins plan to change their wine-drinking patterns. "We tried to stretch the thing so as to include Burgundy," he said, "but we never got too far. Bordeaux really takes you in and holds you."
The couple have visited Bordeaux several times and have even met a few chateau owners, but outside of a few tastings run by Bob and Ben, they have had little to do with the so-called wine establishment in this country.
Hanteillan, Haut-Batailley, Haut-Brion, Issan . . .
Despite their considerable experience with fine wines, the McLaughlins are not collectors. "We have a rack that holds about 300 bottles," he said, "but we live on a flood plain and a couple of times the water has come in and covered the bottom two-thirds of the rack. There we were with 200 bottles with no labels." Now their wine collection amounts to about 100 bottles, all of them, it is hoped, above the high-water mark.
Mr. McLaughlin was concerned lest revelations about his modest obsession give the wrong impression to friends and neighbors. "I have a business here and my wife teaches school," he said. "We wouldn't people to think we were, you know, alkies or something." He was assured that a couple of bottles of wine a week would shock none but the most hard-shelled teetotaler; that in fact, by almost any standard, he and his wife henceforth would rate as authentic connoisseurs.
"Oh, I don't know about that," he said, "but we do enjoy our little hobby. Which is just as well. There are more than 6,000 chateaus in the Bordeaux wine region." The McLaughlins have a long way to go.
Lafite-Rothschild, Lafon-Rochet, Lascombes, Latour, Leoville-Barton, Lynch-Bages . . .
 
TASTINGS
Pavillon Rouge de Chateau Margaux, 1987; about $15.
The Bordeaux chateaux known as premiers crus, or first growths, Latour, Margaux, Lafite-Rothschild, Mouton-Rothschild and Haut-Brion, guard their reputations jealously. They are on top and they know everyone is watching them. Consequently, they spend fortunes making sure that nothing second rate appears under their names. The 1987 vintage in Bordeaux has been written off by many because it did not match up to the rest of the extraordinary vintages from 1985 through 1989. In any other company it almost certainly would have fared better. It was a year when the early ripening merlot grapes came in in fine condition, but the later ripening cabernet sauvignon and particularly the cabernet franc suffered from harvest rains. Chateau Margaux produced a fine first wine by severe selection. But, because it is Chateau Margaux, the second wine was quite good, too. This is the wine known as Pavillon Rouge. The 1987 has good body and a surprisingly long finish. It's probably not a long-lived wine and should be drunk over the next few years. This is a chance to sample a wine from a great property at an extremely reasonable price.

HEADLINE: Seeing Beyond Burgers and Soapsuds

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
FOR some, an entry level job in a restaurant may only mean serving fast food or washing dishes. For others, it may be the beginning of a lucrative and challenging career.
But now a number of professionals in the food service industry are devising training programs for those who might otherwise have no prospects beyond the burgers and dirty dishes, enabling them to rise through the ranks in the food business. 
 Citing both a need to fill jobs in the industry and a desire to help people, they are tapping a pool of high school students, residents of youth shelters, people with emotional disabilities and nonviolent prison inmates. They hope to offer not only job training but some emotional support to ease the way.
Take Randolph Scott. A native of Malone, N.Y., near the Canadian border, Mr. Scott, a 21-year-old high school dropout, came to New York in 1987 and worked as a fast-food cook. He drifted into drugs and became homeless, entered Covenant House and took part in the shelter's cooking program. Fourteen months ago, Dan Kobin, the chef and owner of Restaurant Dano in Greenwich Village, hired him to be his assistant.
Mr. Kobin said he wanted someone "who I felt had potential but who, like myself, did not have culinary school training." At the suggestion of his father, Howard, a supporter of Covenant House, Mr. Kobin asked the group if it could suggest anyone. Mr. Scott was the choice, and he is now Mr. Kobin's right-hand man.
As a result of Mr. Scott's success, Mr. Kobin started a program last spring at the Covenant House residence on West 17th Street to teach some of the residents to bake. Mr. Kobin has started serving their breads in his restaurant.
A Covenant House resident in the baking program who did not want his name to be used said he was planning to go into the food business, "to start slow, move up and some day have my own restaurant."
Dan Gescheidle, president of the Educational Foundation of the National Restaurant Association in Chicago, said, "I don't think the industry has done enough to tap some pockets of the population." He said young people and parents sometimes had to be convinced that these are not just subservient jobs.
"This is an industry with an extremely high turnover," he said. "We have to fill 400,000 new managerial positions a year nationwide." Mr. Gescheidle said his group has been working with 20 of the 60 high schools in Chicago to build interest in careers in food service.
Despite the recession and a tightening of the job market in the restaurant industry, especially in New York, there is still plenty of opportunity.
Dorothy Cann, owner of the French Culinary Institute in Manhattan, which supports a training program in the New York City high schools, said that what restaurants are looking for are people with enough training to step right in and become line cooks and assistant restaurant managers.
Since members of the food service industry, including restaurant owners and chefs, have helped organize the programs and are willing to capitalize on their contacts, those who complete the various courses now have excellent prospects of being hired or continuing their training in fine professional schools.
"Until some of these programs got started," said Alma Pickett, supervisor of home economics for the New York City Board of Education, "we did not have access to the industry and we don't have enough staff to set up the liaison you need, so we couldn't be of much help in the real world.
"Some of the individuals who have become involved with us recently have helped bridge the gap. It's about time they tapped the pool of black and Hispanic high school kids in the city instead of always hiring groups from other places."
In San Francisco, physically and emotionally disabled adults at a residence called Conard House have opened an espresso bar as a training program for food service.
"We hope they will be able to go out and get jobs," said Leslie Gravino, the director of vocational services. "But until we get some kind of hook-up with the food service industry, they may not be able to do that."
They may need someone like Marilyn Sachs, a placement and recruiting specialist for the restaurant industry in New York. Ms. Sachs has helped place people from drug rehabilitation programs at Phoenix House in Manhattan and Phoenix Academy in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., who have been given lessons in basic dining room service and cooking by Stuart Levin, the former owner of Top of the Park and Le Pavillon in Manhattan.
Mr. Levin set up the program four years ago when multiple sclerosis forced him to retire from the restaurant business. He now devotes himself to this program.
Most students, he said, "have no notion of the numbers of different jobs in this industry for which they could become qualified, not just in the kitchen and dining room but in purchasing, maintenance and management."
Ms. Sachs has also organized a summer internship program in restaurants for New York City high school students. She said restaurants employing apprentice students, among them Ferrier, Harvey's Chelsea House and Vince and Eddie's, train them in various aspects of the operation and not merely use them as extra help.
Kerron Pringle, 16, is a ninth grader at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn and works part time at Gage & Tollner under the tutelage of Edna Lewis, the chef. She started waiting on tables on weekends about a year ago and now helps with the cooking and baking.
"My other friends are working at places like hospitals, but I have learned so much more working with Edna Lewis," she said.
A number of public high schools in New York, among them Erasmus Hall and Prospect Heights in Brooklyn, have fairly sophisticated vocational cooking programs. But these are often in need of more advanced instruction and better equipment. That's where Richard Grausman stepped in last year.
He devised a program, approved by the Board of Education, to broaden the culinary horizons of the students. Within a few months it became a pilot program for vocational traininginvolving about 700 students throughout the city.
Last week several scholarships were awarded to students who distinguished themselves in the program, including one worth more than $12,000 to the French Culinary Institute.
School systems in other states are considering using Mr. Grausman's program. In Waukesha County, Wisc., outside Milwaukee, several schools have started using his program on a trial basis.
Compared with training the eager students in Mr. Grausman's program, the professionals who have become involved with Fresh Start face a monumental challenge. They teach a program in food service training for inmates at Rikers Island who are serving sentences of less than one year for nonviolent crimes.
The program was started in 1989 by Barbara Margolies, the former commissioner of protocol in the Koch Administration.
A number of restaurateurs and chefs and others in the food industry, including Joyce Steins, owner of Cafe Iguana and Le Bar Bat, and Lawrence Forgione, chef and owner of An American Place, have conducted classes for inmates in the 12-week sessions.
Classes are held in the kitchens of one of the buildings at the men's House of Detention and as part of the curriculum, the men must complete a one-week food handlers' course.
"They're all sad and sorry cases we want to give some hope to," said Xenia Krinitsky, a legal assistant at Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn, who helps coordinate the program. It has been completed by 54 prisoners, 50 of whom are out of jail, some for nearly a year.
"Normally I would have expected to see all of them back by now," said James B. Kane, the warden. He would like the program to triple in size and accomodate 60 prisoners at a time. "What makes this program so good is the follow-through, the extension from the inside to the outside," he said.
Weekly group support sessions are held among the graduates with some of their mentors from the industry attending to give advice.
"We don't encourage them to get a job immediately," Ms. Krinitsky said. "They need to get their lives together and to receive counseling. A lot of these men have never really held a job before."
About a dozen of them are currently employed and one, Benjamin Marcanos, who started as a busboy at Cafe Iguana, is now rising through the ranks: he is the head busboy and is helping to organize the staff for Le Bar Bat.
Another former prisoner, Rayon Henry, expects to be working part-time with Mr. Marcanos at Le Bar Bat. "Fresh Start gave me the experience to get a job like this, so I can work while I go to school," he said.
Charles Huston, another graduate of Fresh Start who is working in a senior center to prepare meals for the home-bound elderly, said that with what he has learned he can go beyond preparing food in a hospital kitchen and get a job in a restaurant.
These programs offer not only practical training but the kind of self-esteem that is necessary to sustain a vocation. "With food you see a finished product that you can be proud of and that impresses people," said Robert McGrath, a Covenant House spokesman.
But none of the programs will succeed in the long term, those who have organized them say, without the willingness of the food service industry to hire people who have been trained.
"The business community needs to take the next step," Mr. Kobin said. "The industry that is devoted to feeding people has a rich vein of charitable impulse to tap and it's time to give back to people who haven't had the opportunities."

Guinness for Bloomsday
Sunday is Father's Day. It's also Bloomsday. June 16, 1904, was the day in the lives of Leopold and Molly Bloom, Dubliners, that was recounted by James Joyce in "Ulysses." Nowadays the date is usually celebrated with marathon readings of Joyce's works; sometimes that monumental novel is read in its entirety. The Guinness flows like water. 
 This year, for the 10th celebration of "Bloomsday on Broadway" at Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, the activities include a re-creation of Barney Kiernan's Pub, which figured in the novel, at the back of the theater. It will sell Guinness, wine, soda bread, scones and other appropriate fare starting at 5:30 P.M.
The pub will remain open throughout the readings and music, which will run from 6 P.M. to midnight. Those in need of refreshment will not miss any of the program by performers like Geraldine Fitzgerald, Malachy McCourt, Phyllis Newman and John Rubinstein; it will be piped into the pub. Alison Armstrong, who wrote "The Joyce of Cooking" (Station Hill, 1985), a cookbook based on Joyce's works, is helping organize the pub.
Tickets are $8. Members of Symphony Space, students and people 65 and over pay $7. Tickets are available at the box office or by calling (212) 864-5400.
 
More CAFE in Providence
Johnson and Wales College in Providence, R.I., which has 2- and 4-year degree programs in the culinary arts and food management, has announced a $3 million expansion of its culinary arts division. The Culinary Arts and Food Exposition, or CAFE, with 21,000 square feet, will combine kitchens, dining rooms, an amphitheater and exhibition areas. The expansion is to be finished in September 1992.
 
Goat Cheese Ravioli
Fairway Market , 2127 Broadway (74th Street), is selling ravioli stuffed with tangy goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes. It is made for the store by Riviera Pasta in the Bronx. The price is $6.99 a pound (about 25 pieces).
 
Cordon Bleu Connection
For information about cooking courses at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, there is now a toll-free number, (800) 457-2433.
 
Kentucky Cooking in '39
"The Kentucky Housewife" by Lettice Bryan was published in 1839. A hefty tome of some 1,300 recipes, it was squarely in the tradition of Southern cookbooks started by Mary Randolph with "The Virginia Housewife" in 1824. "The Kentucky Housewife" is now available in an excellent facsimile edition from the University of South Carolina Press ($19.95).
In his appreciative introduction, Bill Neal, a cookbook author, remarks that Mrs. Bryan's contribution to the literature of Southern cooking is her thoroughness. Not only are there more recipes than in other books of the period, but the ingredients, techniques and results are also described more completely than was typical at the time. As Mr. Neal indicates, this precision makes the recipes relatively easy to use today without explanations and annotations.
The description of heating fat for frying perch is right on the mark. "Put some lard into a frying pan, set it on the fire, and when it boils up, and then becomes still, put in your fish." Modern cooks may be astonished to find recipes for pineapple ice cream and for rape, and also at the frequency with which Mrs. Bryan suggests tomato ketchup as a seasoning.
 
Recession Cookout
Instead of studying the job market or housing construction or sales of appliances, economists can simply look at the backyard grill to see if we're in a recession. When times are tough, hot dog sales increase.
That's what the people at National Foods , who make Hebrew National Hot Dogs, are saying. In the first quarter of this year sales rose by 17 percent. Sharp growth in sales was also recorded in 1974 and 1982, two other recession periods.
 
RED-HOT AND BLUES
PICTURE a cook strumming a guitar and singing the blues between riffs at the stove and you have some idea of what a 24-minute cooking-and-blues video called "Sauce Boss" is all about.
Bill Wharton, a musician from Monticello, Fla., cooks gumbo and smoked mullet dip, plays with his combo, the Ingredients, and pitches his product, Liquid Summer Hot Sauce. It's an amusing, engaging mixture. The music segments have a late-night, low-key, smoke-filled-club feel and the cooking is decidedly informal. The commercials for the sauce that appear periodically on the videotape are strictly hard sell.
The video is $20 from Bill Wharton, Route 3, Box 124 L, Monticello, Fla. 32344. An audio cassette with just music is $10. Two eight-ounce bottles of the peppery, vinegary sauce are $7. There is a $4 shipping charge; telephone, (904) 997-4359. The sauce is also sold at Canard & Company, 1292 Madison Avenue (91st Street), for $3.99.

HEADLINE: The President's Petulance

 BODY:
On March 6, President Bush appeared before Congress to celebrate victory in the Persian Gulf and to challenge the assembled legislators to convert triumph abroad into progress at home. Mr. Bush trotted out a crime bill and a transportation bill and said, "If our forces could win the ground war in 100 hours, then surely Congress can pass this legislation in 100 days."
Short of a miracle, Congress will not make the 100-day deadline on Friday. Mr. Bush knows this. He thus plans a series of speeches, starting tonight, chiding Congress for sloth. 
That seems more than slightly inappropriate. First, the President's legislation is so shallow that Congress can hardly be blamed for taking time to improve it. His crime package, for example, is largely a sop to death penalty advocates and would do nothing about the gun-running now terrorizing cities. The Senate will soon vote on an imperfect Democratic measure that would at least try to stop that traffic.
Likewise, Mr. Bush's transportation plan would build new highways but shortchange mass transit -- exactly the wrong priorities for a country that would be better served by incentives to curb pollution and gasoline consumption. The Senate is now debating a more balanced substitute.
But there's an even stronger reason to ignore the President's petulance: He, more than anyone, has squandered this postwar opportunity to address urgent domestic needs. True, he's been ill. True, he's been preoccupied with the Middle East and Mikhail Gorbachev's problems. True, there's not a lot of money available. But that's all the more reason to ask for a sharper sense of priorities from the White House.
The big problems are not hard to identify: a medical care system spinning out of control, states and cities burdened by social costs and drowning in debt, deteriorating schools that surely require more urgent attention than Mr. Bush proposes to give them in his plan for the year 2000. That's a program for 100 months, not 100 days.
Mr. Bush's instinct is to deal with the politics of these problems, not the substance, and to worry issues for partisan gain. The most telling example is his harping on the "quota" issue, even though the civil rights bill passed with Democratic sponsorship in the House would specifically prohibit quotas. His relentless complaints suggest that he is less interested in achieving a sound bill than in demonstrating how stubbornly he opposes remedial action for minorities.
Mr. Bush obviously feels no pressure to behave differently. The polls remain favorable. His 75 percent approval rating in the last New York Times/ CBS News Poll is down 13 points from March and 6 from May, but it's still very high. Further, despite disenchantment with Mr. Bush's handling of the economy -- only 41 percent approve his performance -- and deep concern about medical costs, few issues seem to have a strong cutting edge.
Even so, as the postwar euphoria dwindles a window is closing, a chance to wrench America's attention homeward is passing. Mr. Bush can still keep that window open. But that will require more than carping, more than partisanship, more than stagey deadlines for empty initiatives.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Memo For Mr. Bush

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Many who support you and wish you well are trying to tell you something that goes to the heart of your speech this evening on domestic affairs. Here is their message:
 1. Our nation is falling apart, even if we pull out of the current recession and even if the Dow Jones average continues to hover around 3,000. 
 2. Only you can lead and bring us together, first by reordering your priorities and paying more attention to America than the world.
 3. If you fail to restore America's internal strength, our power to protect our interests abroad will wane as well.
 What alarms and disheartens is that none of this seems to touch you. When you traveled recently to promote your education programs, a youngster asked what you liked best about being President. "I love coping with the problems in foreign affairs," you responded, and then added a few words about education and drugs.
 Listen to what Jack Kemp, your Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, is saying: "There are problems of poverty and despair and economic decline in many people's neighborhoods which the President has both a moral and political obligation to address." His point by inference is that you are not doing so.
 Listen to Kevin Phillips, a conservative Republican who helped shape the G.O.P.'s winning Presidential strategy for the last 20 years. His data show that the richest 2.5 million Americans earn as much as the bottom 100 million, and that consequently the American Dream is fading.
 Listen to Ross Perot, a hard-headed industrialist. Domestic problems, he says, are "controversial. They're difficult to resolve. It's kind of like cleaning out the kitchen or taking out the trash or cleaning out the barn." Seeing the decay and decline all around him, he asks you to put your "primary focus on cleaning up our problems here at home. . . ."
 Listen to William Hyland, editor of Foreign Affairs and a former senior national security adviser to Presidents Ford and Nixon. "The U.S. has never been less threatened by foreign forces than it is today. . . . Taking on new commitments in the Middle East and Persian Gulf while maintaining most of the old ones in Europe and the Far East cannot be justified in the face of a disastrous domestic agenda."
 Listen to Robert Hormats, now at Goldman Sachs, who served Ronald Reagan as a top foreign economic adviser. The Persian Gulf war, he writes, was "the first U.S. military operation in this century that America felt unable to pay for by itself." He concludes that "If America's economy does falter, so will the underlying source of its international power. Thus this nation's central foreign policy priority in coming years and its central domestic priority must be the same: strengthening the American economy."
 Listen to Bill Moyers, who probably knows as much about what is going on in this country as anyone: "Beneath the euphoria of the moment much of our society is in shambles." Between 30 and 40 million Americans live in poverty, more than the populations of eastern Germany and Hungary combined. More Americans are without health insurance than all the people in Central America. Half the children in urban primary schools will drop out before graduation.
 Listen to the Time/CNN public opinion survey published this week. Only 39 percent approve of your handling of the economy, and 71 percent say you are spending too little time on domestic affairs.
 In your only recent foray into general domestic concerns, you condemned President Johnson's Great Society programs as ineffective. Yet as this week's editorial in The New Republic (which likes you more than it does most Democrats) points out, these programs included Medicare and Head Start, and your "domestic policy rhetoric has no substance."
 Your friends and allies and the American people are not demanding that America withdraw from the world. They want our country to play an active, powerful and constructive international role.
 They are not saying they have the answers to the domestic ills, or that new efforts will escape mistakes and waste. Rather they ask that you consider these thoughts: We cannot sustain our power abroad unless we are strong again at home, and we cannot be true to our heritage unless you mobilize the nation to beat back the internal rot.

HEADLINE: Eritreans Want Independence From Ethiopia;
Now Tyranny Reigns

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As an Ethiopian and a scholar of Ethiopia of many years, I am appalled by the outcome of the so-called London talks, supposedly mediated by the United States and Herman J. Cohen, Assistant Secretary for African Affairs. The United States actually failed to mediate between the Ethiopian Government and the rebel groups. The only mediation was a ceasefire agreement reached by all parties May 27. Subsequent talks were held between Mr. Cohen and the rebels. The Ethiopian Government was not represented. 
 Ethiopia's Prime Minister Tesfaye Dinka boycotted the talks to oppose Mr. Cohen's approval for the rebels to enter Addis Ababa despite the ceasefire agreement. Mr. Cohen's justification was that "law and order" was breaking down in Addis Ababa, and he had to invite the rebels to enter Addis Ababa despite the calm and discipline shown, according to most eyewitness accounts, by the citizens. Mr. Cohen's decision did not lead to law and order, but to the spilling of blood of Ethiopians in the streets of the city. This still continues in Addis Ababa and elsewhere despite the media coverup.
On May 28, Mr. Cohen delivered Ethiopia to the rebels as he announced the decisions he reached with the rebels. Peace and democracy cannot be created in Ethiopia by shoving United States-backed rebel decisions down Ethiopian throats.
How can ethnic nationalists, who have no interests in the Ethiopian nation-state, create peace and democracy for all Ethiopians? The anti-Ethiopian stance of the rebels is no secret. For instance, one of the rebel decisions is the dismantling of Ethiopia by allowing Eritrea to secede through Eritrean referendum, rather than a nationwide referendum. Mr. Cohen endorsed this decision, ignoring the 1952 United Nations resolution that federated Eritrea with Ethiopia and reversed the longstanding United States policy on the inviolability of Ethiopia's territorial integrity.
When state power is taken by force, tyranny reigns. Sooner or later, other ethnic groups will also raise arms to overthrow their newly installed ethnic overlords. Mr. Cohen opened a can of worms in Ethiopia that also has implications for the rest of Africa.

HEADLINE: Return Tompkins Sq. Park to Those Who Live in Neighborhood;
History of Unrest

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As I found in research for my book "The New Bohemia," published in 1966, Tompkins Square Park was from the first a scene of civil unrest.
Three hundred years ago, the East Village was Peter Stuyvesant's bouwerie, or farm. According to one source, his original home stood on what is now the south side of East 10th Street, 200 feet west of Second Avenue. Tompkins Square Park was part of a salt marsh, originally known as Stuyvesant Swamp, which extended to the East River. 
 In 1812, under the leadership of Daniel Tompkins, the area was transformed into a defense post against the British. This extraordinary man financed the fortification mainly because the Government's credit was not sound enough to cover an issue of bonds for it. The British overlooked Stuyvesant Swamp in the War of 1812, and the Scarsdale-born Tompkins went on to become an extremely progressive Governor of New York. He tried, among other things, to have slavery abolished in the state and ultimately became Vice President under James Monroe. His last years were fraught with political, financial and emotional setbacks. He died an alcoholic in 1825, and lies buried at Saint Mark's Church in the Bouwerie.
In 1833, the Stuyvesant family gave 10 1/2 acres, now known as Tompkins Square, to New York City on condition that it be maintained as a public park. This condition was only sporadically observed. At one time it became a military parade ground; during the Civil War, it was converted into a recruiting camp. It was also the scene of mass meetings, draft riots, hunger and unemployment strikes. It was again a place of riot in the panic of 1873.

HEADLINE: Immigration Brings New Diversity To Asian Population in the U.S.

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
Unusually large waves of immigrants from Southeast Asia and South Asia in the 1980's transformed the Asian community in the United States, setting off an explosion of diversity among Asian-Americans, the nation's fastest-growing minority, figures made public today by the Census Bureau show.
The political upheavals and economic hardships that beset Asian nations from Sri Lanka and the Philippines to China and South Korea have sent more than two million immigrants across the Pacific Ocean in the past decade, according to Federal immigration figures. 
 As a result, the fastest-growing subgroups under the Asian-American umbrella were Vietnamese (134.8 percent growth in the past decade), Indians (125.6 percent) and Koreans (125.3 percent).
 
'Different From Earlier Ones'
 "These immigrants are different from earlier ones because of their enormous diversity," said Lawrence H. Fuchs, a professor of American Civilization and Politics at Brandeis University. "We had Japanese, Chinese and Filipinos. The variety now is just enormous. You have variety within variety -- more variety of class, more variety of skill, more variety in origins."
In 1965, Asian-Americans numbered barely one million; a quarter of a century later, the census counted 7.3 million Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander background. Immigration represented about 54 percent of the increase; the remainder represented children born to Asian parents here.
While Chinese-Americans are still the dominant Asian group in this country, they, too, have seen profound changes in the past 25 years.
Since 1965, said Ronald Takaki, a professor of Ethnic Studies at the University of California at Berkeley, the number of Chinese immigrants has equaled or surpassed the number who came here in the first 80 years of Chinese immigration.
He said that more than 60 percent of the 1.6 million Chinese-Americans here had been born overseas and that the figure had climbed to more than 80 percent in an area like New York City's Chinatown. The population of Monterey Park, a Los Angeles suburb, is more than half Chinese, mostly immigrants from Hong Kong and Taiwan.
 
Breakdown by Ethnicity
 Nearly 23 percent of Asian-Americans are of Chinese heritage, and about 19 percent, or 1.4 million people, trace their roots to the Philippines. Japanese-Americans, who 30 years ago represented 52 percent of the Asian-American population, now represent 11.7 percent, just ahead of East Indians, at 11.2 percent, and Koreans, at 10.9 percent.
These figures from the 1990 census represented the most detailed breakdown to date for the nation's Asian minority. The figures also included breakdowns for some Hispanic subgroups, including Mexicans, Puerto Ricans and Cubans. These figures show that Mexicans remain the dominant group among Hispanic residents. The 13.4 million Americans of Mexican heritage make up 60 percent of the 22.3 million Hispanic people counted in the 1990 census, roughly the same proportion as in 1980.
The 53 percent increase in the Hispanic population in the 1980's largely reflected a rise in groups that had already established themselves in this country. But among Asians, many of the new immigrants had little cultural connection to the earlier Asian immigrants.
 
More Cultures Represented
 Some parts of the country have been settled by ethnic groups whose very names are unfamiliar, like the Hmong, the agricultural people from the mountains of Laos who have moved by the thousands into communities like Eau Claire, Wis., and Fresno, Calif.
Almost 40 percent of all Asian-Americans, or 2.4 million people, live in California, while New York and Hawaii each have slightly more than 9 percent.
Dr. Fuchs and Dr. Takaki said Asian-Americans had become a more economically stratified group, with a highly visible and successful layer of professionals -- doctors, engineers and scientists -- a strong commercial middle-class that includes grocers, nurses and government workers, and a less-visible group of immigrants, many still on welfare.
Dr. Takaki said he had found welfare rates as high as 80 percent among some Hmong communities. The Hmong, whom the Central Intelligence Agency recruited from their rural homes to help fight the North Vietnamese in the 1960's, "are in many cases illiterate in their own language," and are ill-equipped to find a place in the American economy, Dr. Takaki said.
Filipinos, while no longer one of the most rapidly growing Asian minority groups, still increased their numbers by 81.6 percent , or more than 600,000 people, in the 1980's, according to the 1990 census. But, like a smaller and faster-growing minority, the East Indians, Filipinos tend to have less difficulty adapting to a new culture, in part because most arrive speaking English.
"The Indians are a more integrated group," Dr. Takaki said. "They are betwixt and between -- Asians, but English-speaking. They come here with a certain degree of Westernization and language proficiency."
As a result, he said, they are less likely to congregate in easily identifiable ethnic enclaves.
"This is true for Filipinos too," he said. "Filipinos also represent a critical mass, but you don't often find the establishment of 'Manila-towns.' Filipinos and Asian Indians tend to be much more in the mainstream economy than other immigrants."
But the large existing population of Filipinos and the long backlogs that keep would-be-immigrants waiting for five or even 10 years have slowed that community's growth rate to 81 percent, well below the 107.8 percent that Asian-Americans as a whole have experienced in the past decade.
"You can't get the percentage growth for Filipinos any more," said Dr. Fuchs. "In the case of Indians and Koreans, you have a large percentage of people who are fairly well-educated and have a perception of the opportunity here, a vision of the future. They have friends, connections and relatives already here. The base isn't as large as the Filipinos', so they're in a growth spurt. Once their population base is larger, their growth rate will fall back like the Filipinos' did."
Dr. Fuchs and Dr. Takaki predicted that the 1990's would see an Asian immigration as large as that of the 1980's, thanks, in part, to revised Federal immigration legislation enacted last year.
Other figures from the census released today show the Japanese-American population -- most of them second- third- and fourth-generation Americans -- stands at 847,000. The Korean-American population has risen to nearly 800,000 and the East Indian population stands at 815,000. The Vietnamese population in the United States is about 615,000. Laotians number 149,000, Cambodians 147,411, Thais 91,000, Hmong 90,000 and Pakistanis 81,000.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 22, 1991, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on June 12 about the diversity of the Asian-American population misidentified one group. Figures from the 1990 census show that 11.2 percent of Asian-Americans are of Indian descent, not "East Indian."

HEADLINE: Lindsay to Leave Post At Lincoln Center After 37 Productions

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
John V. Lindsay, who played a major role in bringing Lincoln Center Theater back from the dead, is to retire in November as chairman of the nonprofit theater company. Linda LeRoy Janklow, a vice chairman, is to replace him.
Mr. Lindsay, Mayor of New York City from 1966-73, took over as chairman of the theater in 1984. He is to retire on Nov. 24, his 70th birthday. 
 When Mr. Lindsay assumed the job, Lincoln Center Theater had not presented a play since the 1980-81 season. In 1985, Gregory Mosher was named the theater's director and Bernard Gersten its executive producer. Since then, Lincoln Center Theater has produced 37 shows that have played more than 3,000 performances for an audience of more than 3 million people.
 
Adding to the Theater Economy
 Its productions include the current hit play "Six Degrees of Separation," by John Guare; David Mamet's "Speed-the-Plow," with Ron Silver, Joe Mantegna and Madonna; the South African musical "Sarafina!"; the musical revival of "Anything Goes," with Patti LuPone, and the revivals of "The House of Blue Leaves," with John Mahoney, Swoosie Kurtz and Stockard Channing, "Our Town" with Spalding Gray, and "Waiting for Godot" with Robin Williams, Steve Martin and F. Murray Abraham.
"I'm tremendously proud of the achievements of our theater over the last six years," Mr. Lindsay said in a statement. "We've earned $95 million at the box office and the board has raised $30 million in grants and contributions. And we've taken that $125 million and paid the salaries of hundreds of actors, playwrights, directors, musicians, stagehands and the artisans, technicians and everybody who makes the theater a key industry in this city. Adding $125 million to the theater economy over six years is one hell of an accomplishment."
Ms. Janklow has been a director of Lincoln Center Theater since 1978. She was acting chairman in 1984 when she invited Mr. Lindsay to take over. She is also chairman of Arts Connection, an arts-in-education organization, and is a founding trustee of the American Museum of the Moving Image.
Ms. Janklow said that following Mr. Lindsay would be "a great challenge" and added that "the most important thing is to have a smooth transition and to keep the excitement that has been built over these last few years."
In January, Andre Bishop, the current artistic director of Playwrights Horizons, is to replace Mr. Mosher, who will become Lincoln Center Theater's resident director. Mr. Lindsay has been appointed chairman emeritus.

HEADLINE: Havel, in Rebuff to Paris, Backs U.S.-Europe Ties

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, June 12

 BODY:
President Vaclav Havel today strongly affirmed Europe's ties with North America, which he said should be maintained regardless of political changes across the Continent after Communism's collapse.
Calling the American-European linkage "inevitable, logical and legitimate," Mr. Havel made the issue a main theme of his opening address at a meeting sponsored by Czechoslovakia and France here on a future "European confederation." 
 Czechoslovak officials and journalists interpreted the President's insistence on a continued close relationship between the United States and Europe as a polite rebuff to President Francois Mitterrand. At a meeting in Paris in April, the two Presidents were reported to have disagreed on the issue.
Mr. Mitterrand put forward a largely undefined vision of confederation in a speech on Dec. 31, 1989, just after the overthrow of Communist rule in Eastern Europe. He was said to have envisioned today's meeting as a formal conference limited to Europeans, presided over by the two Presidents.
Mr. Havel, however, backed by his Foreign Minister, Jiri Dienstbier, and other foreign-policy advisers, has made clear that he believes strongly in placing any all-European grouping within the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which includes the United States and Canada as full members.
The Czechoslovak leader also told Mr. Mitterrand that while Prague was not seeking membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or participation in its military activities, it was eager to be involved in its political, industrial and ecological actions. On that issue, too, Mr. Mitterrand was said to have been unenthusiastic, preferring an orientation of the newly democratic countries toward European rather than Atlantic groupings.
The meeting between the two Presidents reportedly was further strained by France's refusal to go as far as Mr. Havel would have liked in endorsing future Czechoslovak membership in the European Community and an earlier association agreement to ease access for Czechoslovak exports.
Czechoslovak officials are said to have come away with a feeling that France was offering Mr. Mitterrand's "confederation" to Prague as a temporizing substitute for a more rapid and profitable European association.
As a result, Prague agreed only to a meeting that Mr. Havel would open today and Mr. Mitterrand would close on Friday; the Presidents will neither chair sessions nor take part in deliberations. At Czechoslovakia's insistence, American, Canadian and Japanese academics, journalists and economic experts were included in the more than 150 invitations that were sent.
Apparently responding to Mr. Mitterrand's reticence over America's share in Europe's future, Mr. Havel made explicit his conviction that links across the Atlantic be close and permanent.
"It seems to me that the link uniting Europe and the North American continent in security matters is and will remain inevitable, logical and legitimate on the historic and geopolitical level," Mr. Havel said.
"Even if it proves, with time, that it is possible to loosen it, even if the alliance transforms itself into a looser treaty, even if one day there is no reason for a last American soldier to remain in Europe, this will change nothing in the spiritual, cultural, political and economic closeness between Europe and the United States and Canada and their civilizations," he said. "It will change nothing in the vital need of the two partners to maintain a fruitful connection.
"I believe that any move leading toward the European confederation must not be conceived or understood as an attempt to separate two continents whose civilizations are closely interlinked or to drive a wedge between them."
Mr. Havel also stressed that NATO should continue to be "the principal pillar of European security" and raised the possibility that it might some day transform itself "into a pan-European structure, growing out of the soil of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe." This, again, would include the United States.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money-Market Fund Yields Down Moderately in Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were down moderately for the week ended yesterday.
IBC/Donoghue's analysts said the short end of the fixed-rate market continued to trend down, affecting money-market fund yields. 
 In the weeks ahead, rates should be unchanged with a slight bias toward going up, the analysts said.
 
Tax-Exempt Funds
 With the Fed doing nothing, said Walter S. Frank, IBC/Donoghue's chief economist, there is some upward pressure on short-term interest rates, but all the action continues in the long maturities. "Because the bond market is in disarray it is exerting upward pressure on interest rates in general," he said.
Tax-exempt money fund yields declined for the week. The average number of days to maturity of securities held in portfolios slipped one day, to 43.
 Analysts said total assets of tax-exempt funds fell by $1.4 billion for the week ended yesterday, to $90.2 billion.
For the seven-day period ended yesterday the average tax-exempt compounded and simple yield each fell 18 basis points, to 3.79 percent and 3.72 percent, respectively.
The average 30-day compounded yield and 30-day simple yield each fell 10 basis points, to 4.01 percent and 3.93 percent, respectively.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day compounded yield is 5.26 percent, while the equivalent in the 31 percent tax bracket is 5.49 percent.
For the fifth consecutive week the best-performing exempt fund with assets of better than $100 million, monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, is the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, distributed by Strong/Cornelison Capital Management Inc. of Milwaukee. The return was 5.15 percent.
The Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund announced yesterday that it planned to phase in a management fee beginning in July.
Assets of taxable funds fell by $1 billion, for a total $453 billion, with the assets of institutional funds down $1.9 billion, to $112.5 billion. Analysts speculate that institutions may be going directly into securities sold in open-market operations, like Treasury bills and commercial paper. Assets of consumer money funds grew by $900 million, to a total of $340.6 billion.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield was down 3 basis points, to 5.63 percent, while the 7-day simple yield fell a similar amount, to 5.48 percent. The 30-day compounded yield fell 3 basis points, to 5.68 percent, and the 7-day simple fell a similar amount, to 5.56 percent.
The taxable fund with the best return on investment was Olde Premium Money Market Series, with a yield of 6.71 percent, up from its best- performing 6.52 percent last week. The fund's distributor is the Olde Discount Corporation of Detroit.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, which compete with the money funds, were down 2 basis points, to 5.30 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: PRETORIA GAINING TRADING PARTNERS

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe

 BODY:
On most mornings, Nico Nel, the director of the South African Trade Mission here, can look out of his downtown fifth-floor office and see hundreds of Zimbabweans lining the sidewalk.
Last year 240,000 Zimbabweans came for short-term visas that entitled them to cross the border, buy South African-made goods and hurry back to earn a profit on consumer products that are scarce in this struggling economy. 
 Despite the harsh talk by the Zimbabwean President, Robert G. Mugabe, about the need for the United States and others to maintain economic sanctions against South Africa, Zimbabwe has always, as a matter of survival, traded with its southern neighbor. That trade has gathered momentum in the last year -- a 25 percent increase, with the entrepreneurs on his doorstep forming a small part of the $200 million relationship.
"Trade has gone from good to better and shows signs of improving further," Mr. Nel said.
 
Trade Ties Growing
 Zimbabwe is only the most visible in a growing list of South Africa's trading partners in black-ruled Africa. As President F. W. de Klerk has moved to scrap major parts of the apartheid system, poor countries to the north and east of South Africa have found it more acceptable to think about doing business with Pretoria.
Nigeria, with the largest economy in black-ruled Africa, gave indications recently about normalizing relations. The intention is clearly for Nigeria, which produces the petroleum South Africa lacks, to get a foothold in the South African market and to allow Nigerians access to South African goods.
Other African countries see South Africa as a possible answer to their deteriorating economies as foreign aid is diminishing from both the West and the Soviet Union. Mr. Nel said South Africa's attitude, at least under the current setup in Pretoria, would be in contrast to that of the traditional Western donors: "Trade not aid," he said.
 
Investment Sought
 Mozambique, which was once aligned with the Soviet bloc, is now actively seeking, and receiving, South African investment in minerals, timber and tourism. Madagascar, which until last year had a closed Government-dominated economy trading mostly with Eastern Europe, recently signed a trade and airline agreement with Pretoria, allowing goods to arrive directly.
In Kenya, the glimmer of a South African presence has arrived in the last several months with a once-weekly flight by South African Airways. In a new policy, previously banned South African tourists can now pick up Kenyan visas at the Nairobi airport.
But the Government of President Daniel arap Moi, apparently feeling pressure from the deputy leader of the African National Congress, Nelson Mandela, has discouraged Kenyan trading authorities from doing business in South Africa. The Government has refused permission for Kenyan Airways to fly to Johannesburg, a route that would help the ailing airline.
 
Nearest Neighbors
 Financial experts predict the heart of the economic relationship between South Africa and the rest of the continent will lie with what have been known as the front-line states. Until Mr. de Klerk took office in 1989, South Africa seemed intent on subduing these countries -- Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Angola, Mozambique and Tanzania -- with military assault rather than encouraging them as trading partners.
In a telling sign, the phrase front-line states is disappearing from the lexicon here and being replaced with Southern Africa, which incorporates South Africa and Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. This is the most economically productive region in Africa south of the Sahara, with a wealth of natuaral resources ranging from Angola's oil to Botswana's diamonds to deep water ports.
"As South Africa is integrated into the region, there will be more trade among all the countries," said Michael Humphrey, the chief economist of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries.
Zimbabwe hopes to improve its current unfavorable trade balance, Mr. Humphrey said. About 20 percent of Zimbabwe's imports, including steel, chemicals and machinery come from South Africa, with only 8 percent of Zimbabwe's exports going to South Africa, he said.

HEADLINE: S.& L.'s Have First Profits in Four Years

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
The battered savings and loan industry may be slimming down to its healthy core. The Government reported today that the industry had posted its first quarterly profit in four years.
"Clearly, there is a segment of this industry that will survive," said T. Timothy Ryan Jr., director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates savings associations that are not in Government hands. "These have been some of the toughest years that anyone has encountered, and some of these institutions have been able to do quite well." 
 The $626.8 million profit for the first three months does not include the huge losses at hundreds of savings associations that have been seized by regulators. But officials said those losses, expected to be released on Thursday, will be lower than the $904 million posted in the last quarter of 1990.
The Government's senior auditor, Charles A. Bowsher, said this week that the rescue of those institutions was in such disarray that the General Accounting Office was unable to calculate its ultimate cost to taxpayers but that the total would be far more than the $130 billion projected by the Bush Administration last year. Since the bailout began in 1989, the regulators have spent almost $80 billion; Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady is expected in two weeks to ask Congress for $50 billion more to continue the process into next year.
Congress delayed for months on voting more money the last time the Treasury asked for it, and Mr. Bowsher's assessment has heightened the Administration's political difficulties now. The chairman of the House Budget Committee, Leon Panetta, said today that he would oppose any additional funds until the General Accounting Office is able to complete an audit of the rescue effort.
"It is increasingly clear that the Federal effort to resolve the savings and loan debacle is a debacle in itself," said Mr. Panetta, Democrat of California. "Dreadful mismanagement by the Federal Government has been the hallmark of this entire scandal."
The encouraging news about the profits in the savings and loans in private hands was tempered by a significant increase in the amount of delinquent loans over the first three months of this year and by the continuing slump in many commercial real estate markets around the nation.
 
More Bank Failures Expected
 The real estate recession is also plaguing the nation's commercial and savings banks, leading regulators this week to raise their estimates of bank failures over the next 18 months to as many as 440 from an earlier estimate of 340.
Officials attributed the savings industry's profit to the sharp increase at the beginning of the year in the difference between the rates that savings associations pay depositors and what they charge borrowers and mortgage holders. The increase in this spread was caused by the drop in short-term interest rates that was not matched by lower loan rates.
Most of the largest bankrupt savings associations have already been taken over. But the figures released today on 2,283 private savings associations include the results from at least 125 institutions that the Government expects to seize and either close or sell by the end of the year. The industry lost $1.4 billion in the last quarter of last year and $372.9 million in the first quarter of 1990.
 
In Less Dire Straits
 Regulators say they have begun paying closer attention to the group of unhealthy savings associations that are in less dire straits. The group includes institutions that are not meeting regulatory standards but are still posting profits, and those that are meeting standards but are not recording profits. The group consists of 378 associations, or about 17 percent of the industry, holding more than a quarter of the industry's assets.
Mr. Ryan said officials were considering a new policy, which would not require a change in law, under which the Government would both provide financial assistance to these associations and encourage them to merge with stronger institutions. He said the Treasury officials and other regulators had not decided whether to switch to such open assistance.
How the borderline institutions are handled is crucial to the ultimate costs of the bailout. Treasury Secretary Brady has predicted that as many as 1,000 institutions may ultimately need to be rescued. In the last two years, the Government has rescued 408 savings associations. An additional 210 are now in Government hands.

HEADLINE: Bush Hails Salvador Chief, Saying Rebels Block Peace

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
President Bush praised President Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador today for strides taken to end that country's decade-long civil war, and blamed leftist guerrillas for blocking the final path to peace.
After a two-hour meeting between Administration and Salvadoran officials, the State Department's senior Latin American specialist, Bernard W. Aronson, amplified Mr. Bush's remarks, accusing the rebels of "stalling deliberately" on a cease-fire plan while stepping up their violence. 
 Mr. Aronson said the Administration would probably begin the process of disbursing $42.5 million in American military aid to El Salvador that the White House had withheld this year pending the outcome of United Nations-sponsored peace talks.
"How many more Salvadorans must die before the guerrillas understand that Salvadorans want peace and freedom, not violence and war?" Mr. Bush said, joining Mr. Cristiani in a ceremony on the White House south lawn.
 
Rebels Denounce Comments
 The Administration's remarks reflect a strategy to increase pressure on the rebels to quit fighting and iron out the last remaining differences on a settlement.
The comments drew sharp criticism from representatives of the guerrillas, who say the Salvadoran Government bears equal blame for the faltering peace talks, and United States lawmakers, who warned that disbursing the remaining 1991 military aid now could remove the Administration's leverage over the Government to conclude a speedy peace settlement.
Ramon Cardona, a spokesman for the rebels in New York, said the Government was, among other things, trying to renegotiate terms already settled.
Mr. Aronson, who is Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, did not say when the lengthy disbursement process might start, but said it could be halted if the rebels quit fighting and bargained in good faith.
 
Talks Set to Resume
 American officials, as well as all sides in the negotiations, said that despite the invective and stepped up fighting, prospects for peace were not permanently damaged. Government and rebel negotiators are set to resume talks under United Nations mediation in Mexico City this weekend.
In addition to meeting with Administration officials today, Mr. Cristiani sought to persuade members of Congress that uninterrupted military aid would hasten the peace process.
The House and the Senate are considering foreign aid bills that would give the Administration only half of the $85 million in military aid requested for El Salvador in fiscal 1992. The rest could be used only if Mr. Bush determined the guerrillas were not negotiating in good faith.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today narrowly rejected a Democratic attempt to impose restrictions on the aid package, but the issue is likely to return when the full Senate votes on the bill later this summer.
Since 1987, the United States has authorized $440.5 million in military aid and $1.5 billion in economic aid to El Salvador, according to the State Department.
By comparison, Panama received $447.4 million in economic aid in the same period, most of it since Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was ousted in the United States invasion of December 1989. Nicaragua has received $487.7 million in economic aid since President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro took office in April 1990. Neither country received American military aid during that time.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Hits a High for 1991 Against Mark and the Yen

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar surged to a new 1991 high against the mark and yen yesterday, lifted by the hope for a faster economic recovery in the United States and the absence of any central bank intervention to slow the rally.
The surge yesterday brought the dollar to a high of 1.7945 marks in trading during the day, which meant the United States currency had risen by 24 percent since this rapid rally began in early February. The dollar rose to 142.10 yen during the day, up 11 percent since February. 
 Profit taking and worries about central bank intervention in the future pared some of the gains in the afternoon. But the dollar was still at 1.7880 marks in late trading, above the previous high of 1.7830 hit on April 29 and above the Tuesday close of 1.7740. The close in New York yesterday was also a new high for the year.
Against the yen the dollar closed at 141.50, up from 141.25 on Tuesday and a new high for the year. The dollar had set its previous high against the yen in Monday trading.
 
Rally Expected to Continue
 Some analysts said that the surge of the dollar to new highs against the mark and yen would mean that the rally would continue.
But other analysts argue that the new weakness of the yen against the dollar means that officials at the Bank of Japan are less likely to cut interest rates there very soon, a move that would weaken the yen further and add to inflation pressures by raising import prices.
The Germans have the same concern about the inflationary impact of a weaker mark and some analysts think a further dollar rally could lead to an increase of interest rates there.
Both these facts, analysts say, could help slow the dollar rally as would well-timed central bank dollar selling.
"I think it will probably trade higher," said Robert A. White, vice president at First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. But, he also warned that "we are making a lot of assumptions on the first day of a breakout." He added, It may need a little more watching to see if it really is a new move."
Several important economic indicators on inflation and the pace of the economy are scheduled to be released today and tomorrow and that could affect the course of the dollar.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Tumble in Price

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell sharply and long-term interest rates rose to their highest level in nearly seven months yesterday, as the pessimism that has enveloped the credit markets in recent days deepened.
Market participants said there was no single reason that caused the selloff. The move was a defensive reaction in advance of coming reports on inflation and the economy, they said. 
 Today the Government is expected to release information on retail sales activity and producer prices for May. Those reports will be followed on tomorrow with industrial production figures as well as the Consumer Price Index.
 
May Employment Data
 In keeping with the May employment report, which showed the first increase in payroll employment in 11 months and a rise in hours worked, most analysts expect the economic numbers due out today and tomorrow to show more strength than in recent months. The analysts also anticipate that inflation, which was very benign in March and April, picked up a bit in May.
Rumors circulated yesterday that the numbers would be even worse than the forecasts. Given the very negative climate, those rumors led to selling.
"There is a lot of fear," said Jay Goldinger, a principal at Capital Insight, a bond brokerage firm in Beverly Hills, Calif. "The market is in the mood where any sort of news is seen as a reason to sell."
Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and economist at S.G. Warburg & Company, said that "if the numbers are no worse than expected it will come as a relief."
 
Inflation Numbers Outlook
 Most analysts are expecting the inflation numbers to show that prices rose by about three-tenths of a percentage point last month, slightly higher than the very small increases recorded in March and April.
"The market has already priced in that sort of news," Mr. Liro said. "As a consequence, it may rally some out of relief if those numbers are actually reported."
Long-term bond prices bore the brunt of the market's decline yesterday.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 95 15/32, down 3/4 point, or $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 8.54 percent, up from 8.47 percent late Monday. It is the highest yield on the benchmark issue since Nov. 19, when long-term bond yields reached 8.56 percent.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 97 5/8 late yesterday, down 17/32, to yield 8.35 percent. And the 6 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 14/ 32, down 5/32, to yield 7.06 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed.
Three-month bills were offered in late trading at a discount rate of 5.54 percent, down one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 5.78 percent.
The slide in Treasury prices had an adverse impact in the corporate and tax-exempt municipal bond markets.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, market participants said that prices of most issues declined by anywhere from 1/4 point to 1/2 in thin trading.
The slide was even worse in the tax-exempt municipal bond market, where prices of most widely quoted issues fell by 3/4 point.

HEADLINE: In One City, Signs of an Upturn

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: READING, Pa., June 9

 BODY:
If the chief characteristic of emerging recovery is that the various individual economic signals are mixed, Berks County is now watching a recession fade into history.
Fitfully, sometimes almost imperceptibly, business here is gradually improving, accompanied by growing confidence that, by summer's end, a rebound -- most likely a modest one -- will be obvious, to all. 
 "We see some signs that things are starting to turn," said Harold R. Johnson, regional personnel manager here for the Glidden Company. It is not yet the burst that usually marks spring for the Cleveland-based paint maker, but a series of "spurts and starts" in recent weeks that hints of something solid.
Over at Herbert Cook's Midas muffler shop, things seem even better. Slack business had forced him to put 20 employees on short hours between mid-February and the end of April.
"Customers are coming back in," a relieved and smiling Mr. Cook said, adding that most of his workers were back full time and that the rest would soon be offered full-time jobs.
 
Some Softness Remains
 Still, some parts of the local economy remain weak. And there is some question whether a bit of an upswing represents anything more than the usual seasonal rise owing more to favorable weather than a turn in the business cycle.
Nearly 7,000 Berks County residents are delinquent in paying property taxes, 27 percent more than a year ago, estimated Virginia Lilley, acting director of the Tax Claims Bureau at the county courthouse. Jobs are also scarce. Although both initial claims for unemployment insurance and the number of people drawing unemployment benefits fell in May, only a quarter of the 130 workers who lost their jobs with the gradual closing of the Sonoco Fibre Drum Inc., plant had found new ones as of mid-May, and many of these were at lower wages.
In short, Reading appears to be displaying a textbook pattern of the early stages of recovery: various predictive and coincident indicators of economic health, like real estate sales, show improvement, while those that tend to move only on a delayed basis, like specialty steels for auto makers, are lagging.
Reading, with a population of 78,300, has no dominant company or industry and many employers remain nonunion. The area has about 30 percent of its jobs in manufacturing, compared with about 20 percent for the United States at large.
Reading makes a wide variety of products, ranging from Quaker Maid kitchen cabinets to Luden's cough drops, from pretzels to printing presses. Since late last year, The New York Times has been tracking business activity in this blue-collar town on the edge of the Pennsylvania Dutch country, every other month. Last April, there were early signs of a recovery, especially at the Glen-Gery Corporation, the nation's third-largest brick maker, which was benefiting from the surge in new-home sales and residential construction. "We continue to see a good pickup," said Steve Matsick, Glen-Gery's vice president for finance.
Surveying things two months later, with Reading and its environs a sort of proxy for the whole economy, Bernard M. Markstein, chief economist for Meridian Bancorp Inc., a banking company based here, has little doubt that the nation's ninth postwar recession will prove no longer -- and probably less severe -- than the 11-month average of its postwar predecessors.
"The turn is clearly occurring," he contended. "At worst, we're going through the bottom now."
The Abraham Lincoln Hotel, a downtown landmark that was for sale in December, has been sold for conversion to rental housing, though commercial real estate is still in the doldrums.
Even the weak areas do not seem grounds for alarm. The unemployment rate, which has climbed above 7 percent this spring, often keeps rising well into recoveries and basic-industry companies are often last to join in. That is what's happening at the venerable Carpenter Technology Corporation, a 102-year-old maker of steel products that was founded the day after the fabled flood in Johnstown, Pa., spewed tons of pig iron through the town. James H. Carpenter, who founded the company in 1889 after a Navy career that he began at 14, took pride in paying his workers in gold.
But Robert W. Cardy, president of Carpenter Technology, said he saw no hard evidence of rebound for his company. "I don't see any signs of it picking up," said Mr. Cardy, whose company's products are found in every major Pentagon weapons system and account for six or seven pounds of every car produced by Detroit's Big Three.
Mr. Markstein, the bank economist, believes that Reading's recession probably began a few months later than July, which now marks the beginning of the national downturn, and has been limited by exceptional adaptability.
Some businesses, of course, thrive on recessions, and the huge Kiwi Brands plant out in Douglassville, source of perhaps two-thirds of American shoe polish, is a notable example. "People tend not to purchase shoes as frequently so they take better care of the shoes they currently own," said Steven P. Stanbrook, executive vice president of Kiwi, whose polish lines also include Esquire and Cavalier.
Generally, however, Berks County is a place of budding optimism that, in sharp contrast to last November, each new week will be better than the last rather than worse.
John C. Rinehart, executive director of the Reading Regional Airport, finds business travelers "out and about a bit again" and people talking about the shape of the recovery, not whether it exists. Passenger traffic at the airport, which in February tumbled to 16 percent below levels a year earlier, was still down 14 percent in March but by April had recovered to just 1.8 percent below April 1990.
Frank Borek made 38 sales at his suburban used-car lot in May, the fourth straight monthly advance, while activity at the 51-store complex of factory outlets in a renovated textile mill west of town nearly kept pace with inflation by running about 2 percent above comparable 1990 levels during the 10 days straddling June 1.
"I'd say it bottomed out at the end of February, early March," said Jay Titsworth, president of VF Factory Outlet, which owns the complex, adding that such "core" items as jeans and linens were doing markedly better than such nonessentials as toys and luxury goods.
 
Chocolates Doing Well
 But Godiva's Reading chocolate plant, its only one in the United States, has been virtually unaffected by recession, according to Kevin Lowery, a spokesman for the Campbell Soup Company, Godiva's parent. That is because this is a superpremium product, the "essence" of fine chocolate, Mr. Lowery said.
The local real estate market has clearly brightened but Robert Noonan, president and general manager of Quaker Maid in Leesport, said his operation was only "holding steady" because home building in most of the Northeast remained at a low ebb.
Quaker Maid must rely on remodeling these days but this, too, has suffered because most of it is done in the first few years of moving into an older house and fewer people these days are moving. "You need the new construction business to drive the remodeling business," Mr. Noonan said.
The jobless do not yet seem particularly encouraged.
"Pretty lean," was the assessment of Leonard Dombroski Jr., a 35-year-old equipment operator at the Dana Corporation plant making car and truck frames. Since January he had been working a bobtailed 32-hour week, but last week he was enduring his first, presumably brief, furlough.
"Let's hope," Mr. Dombroski said dubiously as he left the unemployment office, "that we're going in the right direction."

HEADLINE: Report on Fed Sees Optimism

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Some officials of the Federal Reserve Board think the economy could bounce back more strongly than generally expected, according to a confidential report by a respected consulting firm in Washington.
"Senior officials make clear the 'increasing possibility' that the next three quarters could show quite strong U.S. production," said the report, prepared by Johnson Smick International. 
 A copy of the report, dated Tuesday, was obtained by Reuters yesterday. The report said the officials based their opinions on data indicating that manufacturers made deep cut in inventories during the recession, meaning that as the economy recovered, they would need to expand production quickly to meet demand.
"Clearly, officials now question whether inventory reinvestment could be the main engine for a stronger-than-expected U.S. take-off," said the report.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
The National Sports Daily Closes With Today's Issue

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
After 16 months of trying to make a success of being the nation's first daily paper devoted to sports, The National Sports Daily announced yesterday that the clock had run out. Today's issue will be the last.
"The payoff was too far down the road," said Frank Deford, the celebrated former sportswriter at Sports Illustrated who is The National's editor and publisher. "It just became a very prudent business decision." 
 Stephen Hammond, a spokesman for The National, said that about $100 million had been invested in the venture by the National American Sports Communications L.P., a limited partnership whose principal owner is Emilio Azcarraga, chairman of Televisa, a Mexico-based media conglomerate. Mr. Hammond said that Mr. Azcarraga was not available for comment.
Mr. Hammond said the National's circulation was at one point almost 250,000, but had declined to about 200,000 since the paper raised its price to 75 cents a copy from 50 cents in January. The paper has 278 employees at its Manhattan office, about two-thirds of them involved with the editorial product and the rest with business operations.
"I thought it was an uphill battle from stage one," said Edward J. Atorino, a vice president of Salomon Brothers Inc. who specializes in analysis of media companies.
Based on interviews with several National executives, some of whom insisted on anonymity, the publication's failure was caused by a combination of erroneous expectations about who would read the paper, distribution problems and a weak economy that throttled advertising sales.
From the time The National started publication on Jan. 31, 1990, Mr. Atorino and many other media analysts had predicted its early demise because, with sports coverage a staple of all daily papers in the United States, the potential demand for a new sports daily was limited.
Mr. Azcarraga decided to underwrite The National after he was approached with the idea by Peter O. Price, former publisher of The New York Post. Mr. Price has said that he was fascinated that most European and South American countries have successful sports dailies and that he believed one could succeed in the United States.
The two made a deal in April 1989 that made Mr. Price operating head of the new paper. But Mr. Price left the newspaper in January and Mr. Azcarraga took over more direct control through Jaime Davila, who was named president.
 
1 Million Circulation Sought
 A National executive who insisted on anonymity said the paper's original expectation was that most of its readers would be men who read sports pages in newspapers but wanted more. The initial projection was that the paper could break even with 500,000 circulation, and show a handsome profit when circulation reached the expected 1 million.
But an executive who demanded anonymity said that those buying the paper were not regular newspaper readers hungry for more sports statistics, but young men who were rabid fans and spent much of their leisure time watching sports on television, seldom reading daily papers. And there were not as many readers as had been expected. About 85,000 copies were sold in New York City, while target circulation was 125,000.
Mr. Deford was able to attract many of the nation's best-known sports writers and editors, including Mike Lupica, a columnist for The Daily News who has since returned there.
But The National's sophisticated writing talent was somewhat unsuited to its audience, and this spring, USA Today added to The National's problems by starting a weekly devoted to baseball.
The executive who declined to be identified said that the paper had expected to attract an average of six pages of advertising an issue the first year, and eight an issue the second. Mr. Hammond, The National spokesman, said yesterday that advertising had averaged from four to five pages an issue.
By midway through 1990, the full force of an advertising recession struck all publications, and was particularly devastating to newer, less established publications. When The National's existing advertising contracts, at lower introductory rates, expired at the end of the year, replacing them proved difficult.
Mr. Deford placed most of the blame for The National's failure on frustrations associated with distribution. "Essentially, that was from day one the problem we faced," he said.
Dow Jones & Company, owner of The Wall Street Journal, was retained to distribute The National using its network of wholesalers who haul truckloads of The Journal to distribution points all over the nation each day.
 
Missing the Trucks
 But Mr. Deford said that the trucks often could not wait for The National's late press run to be completed to begin their routes. Consequently, The National sometimes went out without the late scores, or copies of the paper with the late scores were left on loading docks, having arrived too late to make the trucks.
In addition, in Los Angeles and some other cities, thousands of The Nationals left in newspaper racks were stolen and resold by thieves.
Roger B. May, a spokesman for Dow Jones, said that The National was delivered to 75,000 outlets through 400 wholesalers, at the direction of Dow Jones.
This spring, Mr. Deford said that he spent much of his time studying the practicality of The National's creating its own delivery system with its own trucks. He said that there were talks with The Boston Globe, The New York Times and some other papers about making The National available through their home delivery networks. But none of the plans proved practical.
 
Bias for Local Sports
 Could The National have worked under different circumstances?
Mr. Atorino of Salomon Brothers said he thought that the United States was too diverse for a national sports daily because most people care mostly for local sports, which a national paper cannot provide as well as local papers can.
But Mr. Deford disagreed.
"Yes, it can be done, but it couldn't be done by a stand-alone company like this," he said, adding that a successful sports daily would have to be published by a company with its own distribution network and the money to wait years for a profit.
Mr. Deford said that Mr. Azcarraga had lived up to every promise and that the staff would be given 60 days' pay.

HEADLINE: Mesa Partnership Raises $616 Million

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, June 12

 BODY:
The Mesa Limited Partnership, the big natural-gas producer headed by T. Boone Pickens, eased its bulging debt troubles today by raising $616 million in long-term debt from several insurance companies and other large institutions in a private transaction.
Mr. Pickens pledged more than half of Mesa's total reserves, including 1.2 trillion cubic feet in the Hugoton field of Kansas and Oklahoma, as security for the notes. Mesa has 2.1 trillion cubic feet of total reserves. 
 As a result of the deal, Mesa will be able to stretch out payments on its $1.2 billion debt at slightly higher interest rates. The deal also temporarily removes the threat of forced auctions of reserves to pay lenders. Earlier this year, bankers forced Mesa to sell 17 percent of its reserves for $440 million in cash.
 
Tough Road Ahead
 But gas prices are depressed, at $1.25 per 1,000 cubic feet, and with yearly interest expenses of $140 million, Mesa faces a tough road back to profitability. The partnership lost $204 million last year, dividend payments were eliminated and the price of its common units, which traded above $16 in 1987, have plunged. They closed unchanged at $3.25 today on the New York Stock Exchange.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Pickens said Mesa needs gas prices to recover to near $2 per 1,000 cubic feet before it can make a profit again. He said that was not likely before 1993, but that the new financing meant that Mesa would not face another debt crunch until 1996, when $300 million in notes mature. "We bought ourselves a lot of time," he said.
Gambling in 1988 that gas prices would rise to $3 by 1990, Mr. Pickens added $700 million to Mesa's debt load when he acquired some of the gas reserves of Tenneco Inc.
 
Fast Recovery Called Unlikely
 The purchase made Mesa one of the nation's largest independent gas producers, but now some analysts believe gas prices are not likely to rise fast enough for Mesa to meet debt payments and develop new reserves even with the new financing pact.
"While this deal buys Mesa time, it does not change Mesa from a liquidating entity," said Timothy J. Curro, an energy analyst at UBS Securities Inc. in New York. He said gas prices are not likely to reach the $2.50 per 1,000 cubic feet that Mr. Pickens is hoping for by the mid-1990's, and that Mesa will fall short of cash needed to replace its yearly production.
Mesa received an average price of $1.61 per 1,000 cubic feet for its gas last year, "and we don't think it will be any better than that for 1991," Mr. Pickens said. A combination of unusually warm winter weather and discoveries of abundant new reserves have depressed gas prices to the lowest level in 15 years. But Mr. Pickens asserted that the new financing package gives Mesa the flexibility to "ride out these bargain-basement natural gas prices."
The transaction, managed by Salomon Brothers Inc., raised the $616 million from approximately 30 insurance companies, pension funds and other large institutions. The Cigna Companies, a large insurer, acquired 24 percent of the notes through various subsidiaries. Other institutions were not identified.
The notes were issued with 15 different maturities extending through the year 2012, with yields between 7.5 percent and 11.3 percent. They were secured by unusually long-lived producing fields owned by Mesa, where the average life of a well exceeds 15 years. The Standard & Poor's Corporation gave the notes an investment-quality rating of A.
Rights to the reserves involved in the transaction were placed in a new Mesa subsidiary, the Hugoton Capital Limited Partnership, which issued the secured notes. Guaranteed payments on the notes were fixed according to production rates and prices, with the lowest price set at $1.35 per 1,000 cubic feet and ranging higher, Mr. Pickens said.
 
Extra Revenue Possible
 The terms require Mesa to make up the difference if gas prices are lower than the fixed price agreed to by the note holders. But Mesa can retain the extra revenue if market prices for gas are higher than the guaranteed payments on the notes.
Mesa estimated that about $175 million of the notes would be paid by June 30, 1996, and that the remainder would be paid by 2005. If production falls below projections, payments on the notes can be extended to 2012.
Mr. Pickens said $550 million of the money raised today replaced short-term bank debt, and that $66 million was designated for a cash reserve for the new subsidiary. Mesa also signed a new bank credit line of $150 million arranged by Societe Generale of France.

HEADLINE: Savings Seen by Using Millions to Study Aging

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
Spending $312 million more each year for medical research on aging could save the nation billions of dollars and significantly improve the quality of life for America's elderly, a new Institute of Medicine report says.
The report, issued today, said the United States spends about $600 million on research into relieving the ailments of aging each year, while the cost of treating health problems of the elderly is more than $162 billion annually. The nation needs to increase research on the elderly to at least $913 million, the report said. 
 The Institute of Medicine is affiliated with the National Academy of Sciences, which is chartered by Congress to provide the Government with technical advice.
"There are economic gains to be made by this research," said Julius R. Krevans, chairman of the committee that produced the report. "But greater gains would be in the quality of life."
The report said that the number of Americans 85 years old or more is growing six times as fast as any other grup and that the cost of caring for older people will double in the next decade unless ways are found to prevent or delay disabling illnesses.

HEADLINE: Dropout Rate In New York Shows Decline

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
The tide of dropouts from the New York City school system may finally be rolling back.
The Board of Education's annual dropout report shows that fewer high school students are dropping out before their original graduation date and more are staying in high school for five, six or seven years. 
 School officials hailed the trend as evidence of the success of a decade of dropout-prevention programs -- everything from a more determined badgering of truants to the creation of small alternative high schools.
But outside economists like Emanuel Tobier of New York University argued that the improvement might be a perverse benefit of the city's recession, which has eliminated many retail and factory jobs that entice some students to leave school without diplomas.
 
Class of '90
 And fewer students graduated on time last year than in the previous four years. At least one entering class had a higher dropout rate three years after its original graduation date than an earlier class.
But the class that entered the ninth grade in 1986 had the smallest number of dropouts in the four years since the board began conducting rigorous dropout studies.
Of the 78,936 students in the class of 1990, who entered the ninth grade in 1986, 19.2 percent dropped out before their scheduled graduation. By contrast, 20.9 percent of the class of 1989 left school before graduation day; 20.8 percent of the class of 1988 dropped out before graduation, as did 22.4 percent of the class of 1987 and 21.8 percent of the class of 1986.
More than one of every four members of the class of 1990 stayed in school beyond their scheduled 1990 graduation date, a rate higher than that of previous classes. And follow-up studies of the classes of 1989 and 1988 also showed that students who had not graduated on time were dropping out in smaller numbers and staying in school.
The dropout rate has been one of the most closely watched indicators of the health of both the school system and the city itself. A large number of dropouts would mean the city could have trouble filling the increasingly skilled jobs that its economy is creating. But until 1986, when the board began keeping track of students class by class, the figures were in dispute.
School officials said New York is the only city that conducts such long-range dropout studies. Other school systems, like New York before 1986, depend on projections -- now regarded as unreliable -- based on the number of students who left the system during a given year. The board defines a dropout as someone who left school without enrolling elsewhere.
In the class originally scheduled to graduate in 1990, 15.3 percent enrolled outside the New York public school system and were classified as discharges. In addition, 37.6 percent of the class graduated on time, and 27.8 percent were still enrolled in the current school year. The remaining 19.2 percent were classified as dropouts.
But school officials say the four-year figure is not the best measure of the rate of students who never complete high school. That is because many of the students who stay in school beyond four years eventually drop out. Thus by 1990, the system lost 29.4 percent of the students who started the ninth grade in 1983 hoping to graduate in 1987.
Others like Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, say that if dropouts among the ranks of students transferring to schools outside the city's public school system could be calculated, the dropout rate would be even higher -- closer to 33 percent. Board officials reply that it would be extremely costly to keep track of students in so many locations.
The national dropout rate, which uses projections rather than the board's precise tabulation of diplomas and dropouts, is 30 percent. New York City's rate is roughly average for large cities.
At a briefing on Tuesday, Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, who took office six months before the class of 1990 graduated, hailed the trends as promising and said they validate a series of programs that his administration has begun to reduce the number of students left back, to provide bilingual classes for the influx of immigrants and to bolster mathematics requirements in high school. He warned that an impending budget cut of $505 million might imperil those gains.
"The message is obviously getting out that they have to stay in school and get a high school diploma," Mr. Fernandez said. "The trends are all going in a positive direction."
The news was not completely bright. The 29.4 percent dropout rate of the class of 1987 -- the second group studied for seven years until the age of 21 -- was higher than that of the class of 1986, which had a 28.3 percent rate.
The proportion of students in the class of 1990 who graduated after four years -- 37.6 percent -- was smaller than those of who both the 1989 and 1988 classes. Board of Education officials said those figures show that students, more burdened by jobs or children of their own than their predecessors were, are taking longer to finish school.
There were also some indications in statistics for individual high schools that strong principals can make a difference. Thomas Jefferson High School in the East New York section of Brooklyn has long had a dropout rate among the worst in the city, but that reputation is changing since a new principal, Carol Burt-Beck, went to the school several years ago. It has seen a steady decline in its four-year dropout rates, from 39.7 percent in 1987 to 33.9 percent in 1990.
Because of changes in the methods of calculations, the city's figures do not reflect changes among individual ethnic or racial groups. A recent survey by the Census Bureau showed that, nationally, blacks were finishing high school in greater numbers than ever before.

HEADLINE: Stocks in Broad Slide; Dow Falls by 23.92

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Rising long-term interest rates, fears of renewed inflation and sell programs slashed stock prices yesterday. But the day's largest losses were softened by some bargain hunting late in the session and by the relatively low volume of trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 23.92, to 2,961.99. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange rose to 166.2 million shares, from 161.6 million the day before. There were 364 Big Board stocks up on the day and 1,238 issuesthat declined. 
 Among the other market gauges, the Standard & Poor's 500 index closed off 4.40, at 376.65; the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.25, to 206.58; the Nasdaq composite index lost 5.57, at 491.05, and the American Stock Exchange's Market Value Index dropped 3.09, to 366.71.
"The decline in Treasury bond prices at the opening triggered the selloff in the equities market," said Bernard Spilko, senior vice president at the New York branch of Bank Julius Baer of Zurich, which manages European pension funds.
"What caused bond prices to fall with the resultant rise in long-term interest rates," Mr. Spilko continued, "was more optimistic statements about the economy by the President and some present and former Federal Reserve officials Tuesday and early today."
Because rising long-term interest rates could reignite inflation, many investors moved to the sidelines to await the Government reports on May wholesale prices, which is due this morning, and last month's Consumer Price Index, which is scheduled for release early tomorrow. In addition, a number of other economic reports are expected this week.
Mr. Spilko also noted that the recent strength of the dollar had attracted only a modest amount of foreign investment in the domestic stock market, and that this unexpected development might have inhibited some domestic portfolio managers as well.
In any event, the wide market swings left most of the Big Board's most actively traded issues with fractional gains or declines. Pepsico was the most active issue, off 3/8, to 30 1/8, on a turnover of 3.2 milion shares.
Johnson & Johnson, the 10th-most-active issue, was an exception. It lost 1 5/8, at 85 1/4, on a volume of 1.3 million shares. Brokers said the decline in Johnson & Johnson might have been in reaction to news that the company was involved in a deal to sell 250,000 shares it owns in Medchem Products Inc. Medchem itself proposes to sell 1.75 million of its own shares. Another 250,000 Medchem shares would be offered upon exercise of warrants held by the Itel corporation's Signal Capital Corporation. Itel slipped 1/2, to 16 1/2, and Medchem was unchanged at 11 7/8.
Stocks of semiconductor companies were battered after an industry association said in effect that shipments in May had exceeded new orders. Among the larger declines were Applied Materials, down 1 3/4, to 30 1/2; Intel, 1 7/8, to 49 3/8; Motorola, 1 1/8, to 63 1/2; Texas Instruments, 1 1/4, to 34 1/2; Telxon, 1, to 17 3/8. Among the rare gainers in this sector were Wang Lab B, up 1/8, to 3 1/2; VLSI Tech, up 3/8, to 9 3/8.

HEADLINE: Bush Outlines an Attack on Domestic Ills

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
In response to accusations that he lacks a domestic policy, President Bush tonight blamed Congress for failing to meet his legislative schedule and sketched his approach to unleashing the "magic of America" to cure serious social problems.
The philosophical underpinning of Mr. Bush's speech, delivered on the White House South Lawn but not broadcast live on television, was a significant departure from the views of his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, as Mr. Bush called for a synthesis of Reagan-era economics with government and community-based social action. 
 He said both the unfettered market policies of Mr. Reagan and the "bigger government was better government" philosophy of President Jimmy Carter had been inadequate. But he suggested that elements of each could be combined with his brand of Mr. Reagan's voluntarism to produce "an America whole and good."
Mr. Bush criticized Congress as blocking what he said were his efforts to "tackle the urgent problems on the home front."
The speech offered no new programs to back Mr. Bush's vision beyond a restatement of the modest domestic proposals he has already given to Congress.
Instead, Mr. Bush said he was setting forth his philosophy of "the shared strength and promise of America," which he said did not have to settle for a society in which "there must always be those who are left behind."
In an important passage, Mr. Bush paid tribute to the economic boom of the 1980's. But he said it had left the nation with intractable social problems. "We began a decade of exceptional economic growth and created 20 million new jobs," he said.
"And yet, let's face it, many of our streets are still not safe, our schools have lost their edge and millions, millions, still trudge the path of poverty. There is more to be done and the marketplace alone can't solve all our problems."
Mr. Bush stated his idea like this:
"There is a better way, one that combines our efforts -- those of a government properly defined, the marketplace properly understood and service to others properly engaged. This is the only way to an America whole and good."
 
A Campaign Slogan for 1992
 With that last phrase, the President clearly seemed to be reaching for a slogan that he can carry into the 1992 Presidential election, in which Democrats are sure to strike at his most vulnerable point: domestic issues.
Today's speech suggested that Mr. Bush is planning to stress his record as a diplomat and wartime leader while offering assurances that he can also lead the country on economic and social issues and painting the Democrats as offering a gloomy vision of America while he "is confident about what lies ahead."
We must "carry forward the magic of America," Mr. Bush said. "We must carry forward what is good and reach out and embrace what is best."
But if today's speech was intended to build a defense against Democratic criticism and serve as a springboard for the 1992 campaign, it was oddly presented.
The White House, which has been struggling for two and a half years to coordinate its message, presented the speech as a major address on domestic policy when it was announced on Monday. But it never asked the television networks for live coverage of the event.
Then for two days, White House officials sought to play down expectations, specifically ruling out any chance that Mr. Bush would announce new policy initiatives.
White House officials, who argue that Mr. Bush has been unfairly maligned for lacking vision, said the point was not to offer new proposals but to "put things in perspective" on the calculation that if Americans heard Mr. Bush's own words, they would understand his philosophy.
 
Attack Before Delivery
 But the result of the White House's handling of the speech was that the four networks decided not to carry it.
The Democrats, meanwhile, assailed Mr. Bush's speech before it was ever delivered. Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader and a possible Presidential contender, issued a statement critical of Mr. Bush's speech more than eight hours before a text was made available.
"Tonight, the next photo opportunity in Mr. Bush's 'Polaroid Presidency' will occur on the White House lawn," he said. "This is a President who prefers rhetoric to action, symbols to substance, vetoes to progress and campaigning to governing."
The White House had taken pains during the day to say that Mr. Bush would "not bash the Democrats," as one official put it.
But the President's remarks began with a strong assault on the Democratic-controlled Congress that focused on his request that Congress pass his anti-crime bill and highway construction measure within a 100-day period, which ends on Friday.
"I thought a hundred days was fairly reasonable," he said. "I's now clear that neither will be on my desk by Friday. And look, I'm disappointed, but frankly I'm not surprised.
"It would help if Congress would do what the people are asking of them. And I'll keep working with the Congress. My hand remains extended. But we cannot let Congress discourage or deter us from meeting our responsibilities."

Chart: "The President's Legislation: A Status Report"
 
Energy
 In February the Administration proposed an energy strategy that would open portions of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling, remove obstacles to the construction of nuclear power plants, deregulate natural gas pipelines and repeal a 50-year-old law that limits who can enter the wholesale electric generation market. The proposal includes measures to increase the use of alternative motor fuels like ethanol and several modest measures to encourage the use of mass transit and increase the energy efficiency of homes.
On May 23, the Senate Energy Committee approved its energy blueprint, which includes the Arctic refuge drilling and other Administration measures. The committee voted against imposing higher economy standards for automobiles, a provision that was opposed by the Administration. It is uncertain when the measure will reach the Senate floor, where it is likely to face vigorous opposition from those who complain that it emphasizes production over conservation. The House has taken no major action.
 
Education
 In April the President offered a broad education plan for improving schools. The plan included national student testing, school choice for parents, a Federal program of research and development contracts to invent new kinds of public schools and a plan for schools to provide children with a range of social services. The proposals were introduced in the Senate and House in May, and some are expected to be added to other bills when the Senate considers education legislation, probably next month.
 
Crime
 In March the Administration sent Congress an anti-crime bill that revived proposals that died last year. Like the previous bill, the new legislation would expand the number of Federal crimes punishable by death, limit appeals by death row inmates and lift restrictions on the use of illegally obtained evidence in criminal trials if the police acted in good faith.
 Debate on a Democratic crime bill and the Administration plan is expected to begin next week. The White House said it would consider a bill imposing a seven-day waiting period on handgun purchases from dealers if it is part of a package that includes the President's crime proposals. A House subcommittee is holding hearings on the overall proposal.
 
Transportation
 In February the Administration proposed a five-year, $105 billion program of Federal aid to the states for highways and mass transit. The proposal would create a 150,000-mile national highway system consisting of new and existing highways and would earmark nearly two-thirds of all Federal highway aid for the new system. It would also require states and local governments to pay more highway and transit costs.
 The Senate is considering its own measure this week. It calls for the same amount of overall spending as the Administration plan but earmarks less money for highways and allows states more flexibility in spending Federal funds on surface transportation programs of their choice. The House Public Works and Transprtion Committee has finished hearings on the Administration's proposal, but no legislation has been introduced.
 
Banking
 The Administration has proposed revising Depression-era laws governing the nation's banking system. The plan would let industrial enterprises own banks, allow the mergers of commercial banks and investment banks, and eliminate barriers that now limit banks' ability to open new branches across state lines. The House Banking Committee will take up the bill next week.
 The plan's core provisions remain after subcommittee review. But a proposal to consolidate four existing agencies into two has been replaced with one that would increase the regulatory authority of the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and decrease the power of the Federal Reserve. The bill will also be considered by two other House Committees: Energy and Commerce , where it faces considerable opposition, and Ways and Means. The Senate Banking Committee has not yet begun drafting legislation.
 
Civil Rights
Mr. Bush proposed legislation to undo some 1989 Supreme Court decisions, but has insisted he would not go as far as House Democrats, whose proposal he called a "quota bill." Before the House passed the bill on Mune 5, he threatened to veto it. House Democrats insist the bill would actually declare hiring quotas illegal. Nine moderate Senate Republicans have introiduced a compromise measure, closer to the House bill than to Mr. Bush's, and the Administration says it is studying the counterproposal.

HEADLINE: Dinkins and Unions: Money Is Turning Friends Into Foes

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
The shouts of a furious Barry Feinstein, the teamsters' union leader, rang out from a conference room where a handful of New York City officials and union leaders last gathered in vain to discuss union concessions that could head off deep cuts in the city's budget -- and the layoffs of 20,000 city workers.
"Back stabbing" and "double dealing" were among the less salty gibes that were heard, interrupted at times by an angry retort from Milton Mollen, in ordinary times the most unflappable of Mayor David N. Dinkins's deputy mayors. And when it was all over two hours later, union leaders stormed out, complaining that the city had been duplicitous, disrespectful and incompetent. 
 Since that meeting almost three weeks ago -- the last negotiating session between the Dinkins administration and the municipal union leaders -- tempers have cooled. But the talks, perhaps the most far-reaching in years, with the city's fiscal stability at stake, have remained stalled.
And as the impasse drags on toward the June 30 deadline for a new city budget, it becomes increasingly likely that at least some of the dire cuts proposed by the Mayor -- from turning off street lights to closing hospital pharmacies -- will indeed go forward.
What makes this turn of events so odd is that these are the same union leaders who were the heart, soul and legs of Mr. Dinkins's election campaign, who stood at the Mayor's side on election night to celebrate their common conquest. That they seem so far apart today is perhaps the cruel, central irony of Mr. Dinkins's administration.
The municipal unions had achieved considerable economic might during the booming 1980's, adding members by the thousands and winning strong wage settlements that were the envy of their hard-pressed brethren in the private sector.
But just as the unions gained more political clout, they were losing the economic power that sustained them during the 1980's, with a recesson now ravaging the local tax base.
These polar forces -- economic weakness and seeming political strength -- are more than anything else shaping the brooding conflict between the unions and the Mayor, contributing to a sense of unease and drift as the Dinkins administration confronts the city's worst fiscal crisis since its brush with bankruptcy in 1975.
 
A Lose-Lose Situation
 When it comes to money, union leaders are in a lose-lose situation. If they do nothing, thousands of their members could be laid off. If they make concessions, giving back benefits or deferring wages, they risk angering their constituents who remain on the city payroll.
The choices are so bleak that most union leaders, remembering hard lessons of the city's last fiscal crisis -- when union leaders agreed to concessions to avoid layoffs, only to see layoffs occur anyway a few months later -- have simply found reasons to stay away from the negotiations.
Those who agreed to sit down and talk, recalling another lesson from the 1970's, are willing to talk only if they are treated as statesmen searching for far-reaching political solutions -- partners with politicians, the Mayor, the Governor, the City Council, as well as business leaders, in solving the city's fiscal problems.
"The pain must be shared" has become their slogan.
 
Stymied on Concessions
 Mr. Dinkins, too, has little choice but to cut the cost of the work force. But despite his closeness with organized labor, or perhaps because of it, the Mayor has been unable to figure out how to wrangle concessions from the unions.
Union leaders complain that the administration has been unable to fashion a coherent labor strategy. The administration has been by turns conciliatory and confrontational -- granting wage increases that business leaders said the city could not afford, then drafting state legislation that would short-circuit collective bargaining and let the city unilaterally furlough city workers, a dagger in the heart of union power.
Mr. Mollen, the Deputy Mayor who was put in charge of labor negotiations after Mr. Dinkins dismissed his chief labor negotiator in a policy dispute several months ago, acknowledged that the Mayor had been "stymied" in his efforts to avert $1.4 billion in proposed service cuts.
"I am hopeful, I don't know if I would characterize it as optimistic, that the unions will act in ways which we think will be in the best interest of the city," Mr. Mollen said.
 
Cautious About Raising Taxes
 In many ways, the city's current situation is similar to that of troubled industries in the American Rust Belt in the early 1980's. Faced with growing foreign competition, managers could no longer raise prices -- or in the city's case raise taxes without limit -- to meet increased costs and union demands. Instead, they struggled to increase productivity and lower the cost of labor. In the city's case, it risks losing business and taxpayers to the suburbs and other parts of the country if it raises taxes too much.
At stake in the negotiations, according to this view, are the means, not the ends. Will the cost be cut through layoffs, concessions in health and welfare benefits, wage deferrals, productivity improvements or, if all else fails, a long-term freeze for city wages that will eventually lower real labor costs after taking inflation into account?
"Labor costs are going to fall, they are going to fall big -- the question is how they fall," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a research group supported by businesses. So far, "the Mayor is proposing making them fall by firing a lot of workers," he said. "There may be a better way."
 
'Underhanded and Back Stabbing'
 At the last negotiating session, union leaders were furious at the Mayor for consigning the talks to his regular labor negotiating team, rather than taking charge personally, and for allowing his staff to draft furlough legislation.
"There was no substance," Mr. Feinstein of the teamsters said. "We view secret discussion on furloughs as being duplicitous, double dealing, underhanded and back stabbing."
And Stanley Hill, executive director of the largest municipal union, District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said that even in private conversations, discussions have not moved from general approaches to specifics.
"There is no such thing as a specific proposal," he said. "The lead still has to come from the Mayor."
Mayor Dinkins argues that he can hardly be blamed for sweeping economic winds that have hit cities across the country, whether they have strong union movements or not.
 
Wage Increases for Teachers
 But many business leaders and public officials say it is clear, at least in retrospect, that Mr. Dinkins is paying a price for not reading these dire signs sooner. Overruling objections raised by his own budget director, the Mayor agreed to give substantial wage and benefit increases to city teachers last October, and later offered lesser increases to 140,000 other nonuniformed city workers -- members of the same unions that backed him for mayor.
Now, they say, even if his high-stakes negotiating strategy is successful, he will in effect win concessions only to cover the cost of wage increases he has already granted.
"Once you ring a bell, you can't unring it," observed State Comptroller Edward V. Regan. "It's hard to say to a union leader: 'Remember what I told you at that great rally back in October? Well, forget it.' They won a wage increase fairly and squarely and now someone wants to undo it."
 
Paying for Success
 The city's unions are paying a political price not only for the wage increases granted by Mayor Dinkins but also for their success throughout the 1980's, when they won signficant wage gains, after accounting for inflation, while private-sector unions lost members and influence.
City health-care costs have more than doubled, after accounting for inflation, since 1984, while union welfare fund payments, for dental and other benefits, increased by 40 percent in the 1980's, including a 12 percent increase approved by Mayor Dinkins.
But union officials say the gains in purchasing power made by city workers in the 1980's merely offset losses in the city's fiscal retrenchment in the 1970's. And while city teachers and police officers are well paid compared to other parts of the country, their salaries lag behind those paid in nearby suburbs.
In seeking concessions from the unions, the Dinkins administration is confronting a movement that is far from monolithic, with clashing personalities and interests -- there are more than 100 bargaining units among the city's workers -- but with leaders who, after years or even decades in office, are highly skilled politicians and professional negotiators.
 
Nothing to Talk About
 They know from experience that even raising the possibility of giving up wage increases can be a dangerous proposition and that promises made today by the administration can be invalidated if the fiscal situation worsens.
The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association says it has nothing to talk about since talks on a contract that expired last year broke down in a dispute headed for binding arbitration. James Boyle, president of the firefighters union, says he has plenty of ideas about how to help, but cannot even get the hard-pressed city negotiating team to begin talks.
City teachers, led by Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers, say they have already done more than their fair share -- agreeing to a onetime deferral of more than $30 million in wages to postpone layoffs proposed in January.
That leaves a union negotiating team headed by the unlikely combination of Mr. Feinstein, whose teamsters are one of the smaller city unions, and Mr. Hill, from District Council 37, the largest municipal union, with 140,000 members.
 
Often Defers to Feinstein
 By dint of numbers alone, Mr. Hill should be the central labor leader in the city. But Mr. Hill, an earnest hard-working administrator who spends hours each day working the telephones to keep together the unruly coalition of 57 local presidents in his council, often defers to Mr. Feinstein.
"I can't let ego get in the way of a fiscal crisis that could cost people their jobs," Mr. Hill says.
Mr. Feinstein, a brash union leader who had headed the teamsters local for more than two decades, relishes his role at center stage, alternately attacking the Governor and the Mayor, both of whom he has supported on Election Day. The visibility in the city cannot hurt his current campaign for a vice presidency in his international union.
 
Early Retirement
 As they press their case, the union leaders say they want the city to step up attrition, offering older workers early retirement to reduce the need for layoffs. They say they want to work with the city to improve productivity and might consider other concessions, but only if the city can guarantee that layoffs will not occur.
With the Mayor and the City Council at odds on the taxes he wants to balance his current budget, and with the state falling short so far in providing the aid the Mayor says he needs to balance it, the union leaders say they have little incentive to act now.
Mr. Dinkins has taken to blaming his predecessor, Edward I. Koch, for huge growth in the city's labor costs. But Mr. Dinkins surprised many when, with the negotiations floundering, he brought in a consultant, Edward Silver, a labor lawyer with a reputation as a tough professional bargainer -- who helped Mr. Koch shape the city's labor policy during the 1980's.

HEADLINE: NBC 'Nightly News' To Move to 6:30 From 7

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
The NBC "Nightly News" with Tom Brokaw will be moved to 6:30 P.M. from 7 P.M. in New York starting in September in favor of the syndicated show "Love Connection," officials at WNBC, the network's station in New York, said yesterday.
WNBC, Channel 4, announced the move as part of a reorganization of its evening programming. On Sept. 9, the station also plans to cut back its local 6 P.M. newscast to a half-hour from an hour to make room for "Love Connection." Channel 4 will also add a new program called "Ruckus" at 7:30 P.M., replacing "Family Feud." 
 The shift of the newscast means that all three network newscasts will now be broadcast at 6:30 P.M. each weekday in New York, the nation's largest television market. As recently as 1987, all three newscasts were broadcast at 7 P.M., when television viewing levels were much higher than they are today.
The national trend has been to move the network newscasts to earlier times to accommodate syndicated game and magazine-format programs, which make greater profits for stations than news programs. National ratings for the network newscasts have been in sharp decline.
 
'I Think This May Help Us'
 "I have very mixed feelings," Mr. Brokaw said yesterday. "I don't think anybody likes to give up a half-hour of news, but just in terms of raw audience I think this may help us. We have to remember these are very rough times economically."
NBC News executives did not oppose the move to 6:30 P.M., said Peggy Hubble, a spokeswoman for the network news division. She said NBC News thought the newscast would benefit from going head-to-head with the ABC and CBS newscasts in New York. She also cited positive ratings results for stations that have recently moved the NBC newscast back a half-hour.
In May, the NBC newscast had a 5.5 rating at 7 P.M. in New York. ABC's newscast had a 9.3 rating at 6:30 P.M., well ahead of CBS, which had only a 5 rating at 6:30 P.M. for its newscast. Each rating point represents 70,438 households in the New York area.
William G. Moll, the vice president and general manager of Channel 4, said yesterday that the economic advantage of broadcasting an entertainment show at 7 P.M. was the main reason the station decided to cut back on its news programming.
"There are more homes using television at 7 than there are earlier," Mr. Moll said. "So you can make a lot more revenue."
The move was long overdue, he added. "We were out of sync with the other network stations," he said of not having two entertainment shows from 7 to 8 P.M.
The reason WNBC was finally making the move away from news to entertainment, he said, was, "We have the shows to do it now."
 
Ups and Downs of Dating
 He praised "Love Connection" as a "fun show about relationships." The syndicated show features couples who discuss the high and low points of their recent dates.
"Ruckus" is a show produced by the Merv Griffin Company, which also created such syndicated hits as "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy." WNBC will carry the show exclusively; it will not be syndicated to any other stations, at least initially, Mr. Moll said.
Mr. Moll said he was not permitted to disclose any details about "Ruckus," but a pilot made by Mr. Griffin included game and giveaway elements and featured a comedian called the Amazing Jonathan as its host. Mr. Moll said "Ruckus" was not a game show and would not confirm the name of the host.
Channel 4 will try to compensate for the half-hour cutback in local news by changing the format of its "Live at Five" newscast, Mr. Moll said. "That newscast has been built mostly on celebrity interviews," he said. "It will become a harder news show, more a newscast of record."
The news cutback will not mean layoffs in the Channel 4 news staff, Mr. Moll said. "This move is not about head counts," he said.

A Rush of Delays
For reasons related mostly to a soft economy, delays in the release of videos are becoming more frequent. Perhaps the most noteworthy recent example was "Avalon," Barry Levinson's film from RCA/Columbia, which was due out on May 1, but was put off at the last minute until May 15. 
 The reason for the delays is that many stores are waiting until the last minute to order movies from the studios' distributors. As the order cutoff date for stores approaches, the studios occasionally extend deadlines in hopes of getting more orders.
 This means, of course, that movies don't get to the stores as promised. "It happens all the time," said Rich Thorward of Home Video Plus in Glen Rock, N.J, and president of the New York-New Jersey chapter of the Video Software Dealers Association. "We let people know when titles are going to arrive and then the date is wrong."
 Studios also shift dates to avoid competition from other videos, much in the way they juggle opening dates for theatrical releases. Besides "Avalon," recently delayed films include the upcoming "Almost an Angel" from Paramount , "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge" from HBO and "Not Without My Daughter," from MGM/UA , all of which have been moved from June to July.
 For video stores that don't put off their orders, Mr. Thorward said, delayed releases can derail budgets. They also cut into whatever head start video has over pay per view on cable television. When a movie is released on tape, there is a stipulated window of time, usually about 30 days, before it is available for pay per view. A delayed release date shortens that advantage. "It's in the studios' best interests to give a longer window to home video," Mr. Thorward said. "A longer window gives them a decent return on their investment."
 
'Bell Telephone' Redux
 Vintage television buffs will get a bonanza over the next month. On June 25, Kultur will release "Birgit Nilsson," a 45-minute tape culled from her four appearances on the "Bell Telephone Hour," the television performance series of the late 1950's and early 60's. Kultur has obtained rights for 100 hours of Bell programming and plans to use it as a base to create its own series of videos.
"We'll edit the footage and put it together with other material," said Dennis Hedlund, the president of Kultur. "For example, we'll edit Maria Callas's four appearances, perhaps add wraparounds of commentary from opera people and introductions by our own host." Upcoming programs will feature performances by Rudolf Nureyev, Richard Tucker, Joan Sutherland, Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman.
 In July, Kultur's White Star division will release "The Best of Ernie Kovacs," five one-hour cassettes taken from the comedian's television appearances from 1950 until his death in 1962. The release date is July 23 and the price is $19.95 a tape.

Green Card
1990. Touchstone. $92.95. 1 hour 47 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.
Prim, health-obsessed botanist seeks partner for a marriage of convenience so she can qualify for tenancy in a tree-filled apartment. Raffish Frenchman (Gerard Depardieu), a consumer of beef and cigarettes, needs a wife in name only for the purpose of obtaining the document of the title. But then an Immigration and Naturalization Service investigation forces the couple actually to live together and act married, cause enough for "airy, high-concept comedy" (Janet Maslin).
 
Around the World in 80 Days
1991. Public Media. $49.95. Four cassettes. 5:36. Not rated.
Michael Palin as Phileas Fogg in a 20th-century BBC update of Jules Verne's 19th-century novel. Travel these days, comments Mr. Palin, is something one reads about on an airplane. To alter his perspective, Mr. Palin accepted a challenge from the British Broadcasting Company to circle the globe in 80 days like Fogg, the hero in Verne's novel on which Mike Todd based his 1956 movie.
As in the book and movie, Mr. Palin and a BBC film crew set out from the Reform Club in London, traveling through Europe down to Alexandria, Egypt, then across the Arabian peninsula to Dubai. From there they cross the Arabian Sea to Bombay, traverse the subcontinent to Madras, and then sail down the Bay of Bengal to Singapore. They steam up the South China Sea to Hong Kong, and the East China Sea to Shanghai, then across to Yokohama, Japan. From there they cross the Pacific Ocean to Long Beach, Calif., and take Amtrak across the North American continent to New York. From there, London is just one more ocean away.
 Some trains and ships move faster than in the 19th century (although others don't), but Mr. Palin's main problem is that there are fewer of them. Much of his time is spent in shipping offices begging for passage on whatever vessel might be headed to the right place at the right time. By Shanghai he has fallen about 10 days behind.
 Through delays and missed connections, Mr. Palin stays calm, never imparting too much urgency to his statements to the camera that all is lost if he misses this or that freighter. Along the way he takes time for puckish bits of travelogue. In Venice, for example, he tours the city on a trash collection barge. The six-day voyage from Dubai to Bombay on a dhow is also memorable.
Back in London just in time, Mr. Palin and the BBC crew race to the Reform Club, only to find that it has closed for the day and won't let them in.
 
To Sleep With Anger
1990. SVS. $89.95. 1:35. CC. PG.
A black Southern sharecropper with a winning smile and eyes as cold as death (Danny Glover) moves into the home of old friends, where he jogs their comfortable lives with his harsh judgments and resentment of hard times. Small in scope, Charles Burnett's film is "a comedy of unusual substance . . . a big movie, full of big comic scenes" (Vincent Canby).

HEADLINE: New York's Ordeal: The Tax Exit

 BODY:
New York State's budget ordeal is as misleading as it is endless. No matter how stubborn the confrontation between Gov. Mario Cuomo and the Legislature, New York does not have to choose between savage service cuts and an irresponsible, unbalanced budget. Like other states hit by the recession, it has a third option: more tax increases.
Recommending higher taxes is rarely a favorite political strategy. Assembly Speaker Mel Miller tried that earlier this spring and was shot down by the Governor and the Senate majority leader, Ralph Marino. But if raising taxes is unpopular, so is hacking school aid, state police and support for embattled New York City. New Yorkers can avoid, or at least soften, anguishing choices with moderate tax increases, preferably of the broadest-based, fairest kind: income taxes. 
 Right now, the state's highest rate is 7.875 percent of taxable income. That's hardly extortionate. The rate was 15 percent in the early 70's, and 10 percent when Mr. Cuomo took office in 1983. So if it went up even a full point, the rate would still be less than just a few years ago.
Even in New York City, which has its own income tax, people would pay a lower combined income tax than 10 years ago, whether the city tax stays where it is (3.9 percent) or goes to 4.3, as City Hall now proposes.
Speaker Miller's plan would raise the highest rate from 7.875 to 8.663 percent. That would yield the same $700 million now anticipated to come in from regressive new energy taxes. Those taxes so trouble the business community that even the president of the state's Business Council, Daniel Walsh, says that anything -- including a personal income tax increase -- would be better.
An even higher income tax increase than Mr. Miller suggests -- the Citizens Budget Commission recommends a full point, for instance -- would yield enough to avoid some of the cuts that both the Legislature and the Governor have been running away from. The lawmakers, unable to make painful choices, approved a budget that almost certainly fails to balance. Mr. Cuomo was right to respond with line-item vetoes.
But the fact is, he also wants his spending rather than their spending. There is a way to have some of both: taxes.
The Governor's argument that raising income taxes will hurt New York's competitiveness is less compelling now that neighboring states face the same fiscal problems. Moreover, poor services and a decline in the quality of life also hurt competitiveness. For Mr. Cuomo to stick to his no-income-tax pledge, which has always smacked of national ambition, ignores those realities.
The budget crisis demonstrates that the state still has failed to make sufficient structural changes in the way it operates, restructuring services and reorganizing its bureaucracy. But that takes time. Tax revenues can buy that time while avoiding deep, disruptive budget cuts. It's not a perfect solution, but it's better than allowing the monumental mess to go on.

Salomon Official Going To Development Bank

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, had great difficulty finding an American banker to head the merchant banking division of his institution. When the bank opened for business in April, the important position was vacant.
But for Ronald M. Freeman, the head of European investment banking at Salomon Brothers Inc., who accepted the position last week, the job was welcomed. "I did not have to be wooed," he said, even though the move meant a big pay cut. 
 Carrying out the bank's task of helping the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe convert state-owned enterprises to investor-owned companies "seemed like the most interesting and exciting job a banker could have in the world today," Mr. Freeman said. He hopes to be working full time at the new job by the end of summer.
The United States, which provided 10 percent of the bank's equity of $11.6 billion, is its largest shareholder. The Bush Administration insisted that the institution focus on developing the private sector in the former Eastern bloc and that it hire a senior American banker to carry out that mandate. The 51-year-old Mr. Freeman, who has discussed the job with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, is such a person.
He was a consultant for McKinsey & Company in Paris in 1973 when he jumped to Salomon. He moved to the project finance unit in New York, headed the corporate finance department that worked with energy companies, and became co-leader of the American mergers and acquisitions department in 1986. He moved to Europe two years ago. His clients have included Gulf Oil, Chevron, Mobil, Atlantic Richfield, A.T.& T., Michelin and Eurotunnel.
Mr. Freeman, who has a French mother, speaks French fluently and studied Russian while earning a law degree at Columbia University. He also has business experience in Eastern Europe, having been involved in complex deals like swapping East European bonds for Soviet commodities and then swapping the bonds for consumer goods for the Soviets. He has helped take public several state-owned companies, including Fotex, a Hungarian photo processor.
He shares Mr. Attali's goal of using the new bank's money and expertise as a "catalyst" to bring private investment into Eastern Europe.
"When Henry Kravis says, 'I want to put my equity next to yours'; when John Gutfreund says, 'I want to syndicate a piece of that deal,' or when Dennis Weatherstone says, 'We want to lend to that credit you structured,' I'll know we are going in the right direction," he said, referring to the leaders of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company; Salomon Brothers, and the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, respectively.
Mr. Freeman and his wife, Helen, have two young daughters.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Continues to Gain While Gold Prices Tumble

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar continued its advance on world currency markets yesterday, posting additional gains against the mark after the release of some important data on the United States economy.
Gold prices were mostly lower worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $370.20 an ounce, unchanged from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank said gold slipped 15 cents, to a late bid of $369.10. 
 The dollar's gains followed release of reports that showed a better-than-expected 1 percent gain in retail sales during May -- led by a 1.7 percent advance for autos -- and that new claims for unemployment benefits declined for the fourth straight week.
In addition, wholesale prices advanced an unexpectedly strong six-tenths of 1 percent last month. Traders dismissed the number as having been distorted by big, probably temporary, one-time increases for gasoline, vegetables and tobacco.
 
Evidence of Recovery
 The reports were widely interpreted as evidence the economy was on the road to recovery and sent the dollar higher in active trading.
"Even though inflation was higher than expected, in a perverse way that means the Federal Reserve" will not cut interest rates, and that is favorable for the dollar, said Earl Johnson, a vice president at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. Higher interest rates in the United States make dollar-denominated securities more valuable to investors.
The dollar continued to perform solidly against the German mark, advancing to 1.7985 marks, a 19-month high, from 1.7905 marks on Wednesday. The dollar settled off its peaks after a bout of profit taking amid rumors the central banks had intervened to stem the dollar's rise.
 
Was There Intervention?
 "People were very nervous when the dollar got above its previous highs," said John McCarthy, chief dealer at Algemene Bank Nederland. "The market behaved as if there were intervention." No central bank confirmed the intervention.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 141.75 yen, from 141.50 yen on Wednesday. In London, it fell to 141.35 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 141.25 yen, down from 141.50 yen on Wednesday.
In London, the pound fell to $1.6380, from $1.6463 late Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.6345 to buy one pound, less than Wednesday's $1.6450.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.5390 Swiss francs, up from 1.5310; 6.1030 French francs, up from 6.0720; 1,338.00 Italian lire, up from 1,330.50, and 1.1434 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1438.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $369.50 an ounce, from $371.75 late Wednesday. In Zurich, the closing bid was $369.50, down from $371.90. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.52 to close at $368.90.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Bank Stocks' Outlook Debated

BYLINE: By Michael Quint

 BODY:
THE market for bank stocks has been a world of extremes recently, shifting from deep gloom in the year ended in October 1990, when prices fell more than 50 percent, to euphoria in the last seven months as prices have increased more than 70 percent.
But because bank losses on commercial real estate loans continue to rise, and problems with delinquent borrowers are spreading to consumer and business loans, some analysts are questioning whether the market's optimism is justified. Securities dealers, who have already sold nearly $5 billion of new preferred and common bank stocks this year, hope the positive mood lasts long enough for them to complete several more large financings. 
 "I couldn't be more optimistic about bank stocks," said Thomas Brown, banking analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. Besides lower interest rates, which have helped many banks widen the spread between the interest rates they pay on deposits and the rates they collect on loans, Mr. Brown said that investors expected a lessening of problems with bad loans.
"The positive surprises have begun to outnumber the negative surprises," Mr. Brown said, forecasting that many banks would be reporting fewer problem loans by the end of the year.
Expectations of mergers among large banks have also attracted investors, who hope for either better profits when banks in the same market merge and cut costs or a high price for stocks of banks that are acquired.
Nevertheless, some anlaysts are not optimistic. They note that delinquent loans do not normally begin to decline until about six months after the end of a recession.
"The problems in commercial real estate are not going away, and there is more blood to be let at many banks," said Harry Keefe, chairman of Keefe Managers Inc., a partnership investing in banks and savings institutions.
George Salem, a banking analyst at Prudential Securities who was quicker than many to spot the banking industry's woes in 1990, calls the recent rally in bank stocks overdone. "It is premature to say the problems are over and earnings will be normal," he said, adding that loan quality was still the most important determinant of a bank's health.
Among the 23 banks that Mr. Salem follows most closely, he noted that nonperforming loans rose 12 percent in the first quarter, compared with increases of 17 percent in the fourth quarter of 1990, 14 percent in the third and 16 percent in the second. He added that bank filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and bankers' comments indicated that nonperforming loans would continue to increase in the current quarter, which ends June 30.
Although speculative selling of bank stocks exaggerated the industry's weakness in 1990, Mr. Keefe said that several large companies still faced serious problems from their heavy lending for commercial real estate. Among them are the Southeast Banking Corporation; MNC Financial of Baltimore; Midlantic of Edison, N.J., and Shawmut National of Boston.
Consequently, many analysts are recommending only high-quality banks, like the Banc One Corporation of Columbus, Ohio, and the Wachovia Corporation in Winston-Salem, N.C. Morgan Stanley & Company recently added the National City Corporation of Cleveland and Boatmen's Bancshares of St. Louis to its recommended list, saying that both companies had ample capital, low exposure to loss from bad loans and managements that were unwilling to accept risky loans to gain a few cents profit per share.
"I think investors have discounted the fact that loan quality is not improving," said Charles M. Vincent, a bank stock investor at Provident National Bank, Philadelphia. "There is a feeling that strict examinations by regulators forced banks to anticipate their difficulties."
The reserves large banks have for loan losses, however, have become smaller relative to the growing volume of nonperforming loans and real estate owned as a result of foreclosure. Among the 35 largest banking companies, reserves for loan losses have fallen to 57 percent of nonperforming assets in the first quarter, from 60.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1990 and 74.5 percent a year ago.
A decline in the level of reserves relative to troubled loans can be worrisome for investors, since further increases in bad loans could cause a bank to dip into its profits to increase the size of its reserve or to write off bad loans as a loss.
Kenneth F. Puglisi, senior vice president at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., said that while there was no evidence that banks' bad-loan problems were declining, many bankers had been predicting that their nonperforming loans were nearing a peak. But he warned that the optimism could quickly evaporate if "it becomes obvious that the recession will drag on into 1992."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Climb in Price

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday, as analysts and traders reassessed a set of figures that on the surface suggested the recession had clearly ended and that inflation was at worrisome levels.
Initially, market participants reacted to a further drop in weekly unemployment claims, a healthy 1 percent rise in retail sales and a surprisingly sharp six-tenths of a percentage point increase in the May Producer Price Index by selling securities and pushing long-term bond yields above 8.60 percent. 
 Excluding food and energy, the index rose by a more modest four-tenths of a percentage point.
After sifting through the numbers, economists said that the rise in the so-called core rate was an aberration, since virtually all of the increase was a result of big increases in the price of tobacco and civilian aircraft.
"If you exclude those two items, the core rate was flat," one government bond trader said. "That made a lot of people feel better about buying bonds."
 
Some Worries Are Soothed
 Remarks by Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, may also have soothed worries that a rebound in the economy will be accompanied by accelerating inflation.
Speaking in Anchorage, Mr. Parry, who has been a forceful advocate of tight monetary policy to curb inflation in the past, said he expects inflation to fall to a 3 percent annual rate in 1992 from a pace of 3.5 percent to 4 percent this year.
Mr. Parry added that the economic downturn appeared to have hit bottom.
"The Fed has to be very happy with these numbers, because they tell them the recovery is under way, and there is no reason to believe that inflation is accelerating," said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J. firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets.
Along with many other analysts, Mr. Stone does not expect the recovery to be very robust. Nor may it be long-lived.
"This is when the numbers are going to look the firmest," he said. "But after a few months we are in for a period when the economy will underperform the expectations of the market and of the Fed. It just does not seem that the factors that supported recoveries in the past, like fiscal stimulus or strong consumer balance sheets, are present this time."
 
The Secondary Market
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 95 7/8, up 13/32, to yield 8.50 percent, down from 8.54 percent late Wednesday. Following the release of the producer price and retail sales numbers, prices on the benchmark issue fell as low as 94 22/ 32, to yield 8.62 percent.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at a price of 97 7/8, up 1/4 point, to yield 8.31 percent. And the 6 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 1/2, up 2/ 32, to yield 7.02 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were mixed.
Three-month bills were offered at a discont rate of 5.57 percent, up three basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 5.79 percent. But one-year bill rates fell by three basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.99 percent.
Chase Manhattan's $1 billion offering of asset-backed securities highlighted new-issue activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market. But a number of other companies also priced new securities.
Among the issuers was Coca-Cola Enterprises, which offered $250 million of medium-term notes through an underwrting group led by Lehman Brothers.
The 6.80 percent notes were offered at various prices, initially at $99.957, to yield 6.85 percent, 48 basis points over the prevailing bond equivalent yield on one-year Treasury bills.
The notes, which are noncallable for life, mature June 19, 1992. The securities are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and AA-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues were unchanged to up about 1/8 point at the end of a volatile session.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices closed higher after being down early in the day. According to traders, prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about 1/4 point.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week ended June 3.
The declines were in line with market expectations, and the report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: Japan's Rising Trade Surplus Alarms Competitors

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 13

 BODY:
Despite years of pledges to open its markets to foreign goods and slow its powerful export machine, Japan's trade surplus is soaring to politically dangerous levels again after three years of decline.
Government officials have been struggling to play down the trend, particularly after new figures were released this week showing a big jump in sales of Japanese goods abroad, although exports to the United States were down slightly. 
 The officials are saying that it is still too early to tell if the trade imbalance will widen for the year. But private economists say the trade imbalance appears likely to widen in coming months, as American consumers emerge from the recession and begin snapping up Nissan cars, Panasonic stereos, Toshiba computers and other Japanese products.
 
Ready to Move Quickly
 "Japan's competitiveness has been maintained at a very high level," said Yoshihisa Kitai, chief economist at the Long-Term Credit Bank. "If a foreign market opens or improves, we are prepared to increase our exports very quickly."
In May, Japanese exports to the European Community rose 19.4 percent, to $4.9 billion, and those to Asia increased 28.4 percent, to $8.6 billion. Exports to the United States, however, declined 1 percent from a year earlier, to $6.75 billion, according to Government figures.
The statistics point out a crucial difference in the current surge: Japan has become less dependent on exports to the United States, which many Japanese are looking upon as an increasingly unreliable and often irritable trade partner, but sales to Europe and other Asian nations are growing much faster.
"What the figures show is that Japan's surplus should have been even larger in 1990, but it was depressed just by high oil prices," Mr. Kitai said, referring to the large imports of crude oil, mostly from the Persian Gulf. "The high oil prices, which have now ended, concealed the strength of the trend."
Japan's trade surplus with the European Community shot up 79 percent in May from the year earlier, to $2.2 billion. The surplus with Asia rose 43 percent from May 1990, to $2.4 billion. That is a sore point with countries like South Korea, which complain that Japan exports machinery, parts and consumer goods, but is stingy in sharing the technology behind its manufacturing prowess.
By contrast, the surplus with the United States slipped by 20 percent, to $1.95 billion, in May, a result of the recession.
It is a sign of the resilience of Japan that even with its single largest market in recession, it has succeeded in cultivating and exploiting new markets to more than make up for the loss. One trend that is continuing is that Japan's exports consist largely of manufactured goods, on which profits are high, while the growth in its imports is coming largely from raw materials, like crude oil. After declining to $63.5 billion last year, a 34 percent decline from the peak in 1987, Japan's trade surplus is expected to top $70 billion this year. Some economists, surprised by the sudden vigor of Japan's export machine, predicted it would reach $80 billion.
The recent trade figures also show that some types of imports that have grown smartly in recent years are vulnerable to changes in taste; for instance, there was a big decline in Japanese imports of French paintings and German luxury automobiles in May, as a decline in real estate and stock prices here cut back on purchases by affluent Japanese.
"I had expected some growth in the surplus, but this is quicker and bigger than I'd expected," said Paul Summerville, the economist here for Jardine Fleming Securities. "We're back where we started essentially, before all the market-opening measures. The Japanese are ready to strike again."
 
Trade Frictions Expected
 The rising surplus is expected to provoke a new round of potentially bitter trade frictions, especially with the European Community. Edith Cresson, the new Prime Minister of France, has harshly criticized Japan's export policies and what she contends are its closed markets.
Japanese officials have generally responded that the problem is the competitive ability of Japanese companies, not unfair practices. They say that in general the answer is not to protect markets but for foreign governments to act to improve the efficiency of their industries.
The latest surge in the politically sensitive trade surplus underscores the fact that even after some important adjustments to its economy over the last five years to force companies to cater more to the domestic market, Japanese companies are becoming only more efficient in competing around the globe.
 
Huge Sums Are Invested
 Throughout the late 1980's, Japanese corporations poured unprecedented sums into research, new technologies and new factories. They are now beginning to reap the rewards of that capital investment.
There was another stunning figure released here this week -- in the first five months of this year, Japanese auto companies shipped more cars back to Japan from their American plants than American auto makers sold in Japan.
It was the first time that Japan's American factories had out-exported their American rivals, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, but probably not the last.
"This all adds up to greater acrimony ahead," Mr. Summerville said.

HEADLINE: Newly Profitable, Post Plans To Share With Its Unions

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
Peter S. Kalikow, the owner of The New York Post, said yesterday that the paper would turn a profit this year, for the first time in decades. As a result, he said, the paper is returning to its unions up to $8 million of the $21 million in concessions they granted in September to keep the newspaper alive.
"If I eat, everybody should eat; if I don't eat, that's another story," Mr. Kalikow said, adding that he expected to see some improvements in productivity in exchange for the "partial givebacks." 
 The paper announced yesterday that members of the Newspaper Guild, which represents news, advertising and clerical employees, would now be guaranteed pay equivalent to a four-and-a-half-day work week. Last September the Guild agreed to a four-day work week to avoid layoffs.
Mr. Kalikow said The Post had retained much of the bounty of circulation and advertising that it won during The Daily News strike and predicted that, with the givebacks, The Post would show a profit in 1991 of about $14 million on revenues of about $120 million. Should that happen, it would be the first time in many years that the chronically unprofitable paper ended a year in the black.
 
Alternatives to Equity
 "If that's what he does, we certainly expect to get a piece of it," said George E. McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, which includes all the paper's unions. In September, as part of the agreement, Mr. Kalikow promised to give unions 20 percent ownership in The Post, but negotiations on a plan to do so have stalled.
Mr. Kalikow said he believed that the unions "are entitled" to share the paper's success and suggested that profit sharing or bonuses might be more appealing to the unions than an equity stake.
In April, the first month after The News strike ended, The Post had a 29.4 percent increase in advertising compared with the same month a year earlier, according to LNA Newspaper, a company that tracks newspaper advertising.
By comparison, The News's advertising in April was down by 61.6 percent compared with 1990, The New York Times declined by 25.3 percent and Newsday, which includes New York Newsday, was down by 7.2 percent.
Mr. Kalikow said the paper's circulation was about 575,000, compared with a high of 690,000 during the News strike and about 500,000 before the strike, which lasted from October to March.
 
Large Cut in Jobs
 Barry F. Lipton, president of the Newspaper Guild local, said that employees would work an extra 2 hours and 20 minutes a week but that the added time would be considered overtime and paid at time and a half, giving them the equivalent of a half-day's pay.
Mr. Lipton said the increases were justified because the number of guild jobs had declined by about 75 since September to about 300, although the September agreement required a reduction of only 40 jobs. Temporary workers were hired to fill the gap, and Mr. Lipton said far fewer temporary workers would now be used.
Mr. McDonald said that by structuring the increase as overtime rather than by simply adding half a day to the work week, the existing contract was not broken. Extending the guild's actual work week would have broken the contract and obligated management to give the same improvements to all the other unions.
But Mr. Kalikow said other unions would get similar increases, either in the form of restored jobs or added hours. In September, in the face of an ultimatum from Mr. Kalikow, who threatened to close the paper, unions were given the choice of reducing jobs or reducing hours to cut costs. The guild chose to reduce hours, but other unions, like the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union of New York and Vicinity, which represents the drivers, elected to take most of the cuts by reducing jobs.
Mr. Kalikow said that about 90 drivers lost jobs in September and that about 20 had been rehired.
 
Real-Estate Company
 Mr. Lipton said he would seek the restoration of a regular five-day work week and other changes during negotiations for a new contract, which will begin this summer. The existing contract expired on March 6 but remains in effect.
Mr. Kalikow is also the owner of H. J. Kalikow & Company, a real-estate company whose holdings include 4,000 residential apartments in Manhattan, office buildings and a hotel to be called the Millenium, now under construction near the World Trade Center.
Mr. Kalikow has been under pressure from banks because of $130 million in short-term debt. He said yesterday that he thinks his creditors, which include many New York banks, will be willing to extend the payback period rather than requiring him to sell assets at the current depressed prices. The recession and concerns about the failure of many savings and loan organizations has made lending institutions very reluctant to refinance debt.

HEADLINE: In Quaint Nyack, Not-So-Quaint Condos and G-Strings

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NYACK, N.Y.

 BODY:
When this antiquing center on the Hudson courted a developer years ago to build waterfront housing, residents envisioned some tasteful condominiums in keeping with the village's Victorian character.
What they have instead are pink and blue monoliths at the foot of Main Street that seem to scream modern-day Miami Beach more than whisper mid-19th century New England. "It cuts us off from the waterfront and it's visually intrusive," said Nyack's Mayor, Kieran Quinn. "This has just been a disaster." 
 Nyack is not alone, of course, in feeling overwhelmed by development. But to this one-square-mile village, quaintness is more than quality of life; it's also a bread-and-butter issue. The economy hinges on tourism and the village's ability to attract weekend shoppers wishing to take a step back in time.
 
Topless Dancers and a Drug Center
 The frustration over the condominiums and how they grew is just one symptom of a growing identity crisis for Nyack, once a down-at-the-heels village victimized by the creation of a nearby mall and now a thriving town. There is, for example, the new bar with bare-breasted dancers -- a dubious symbol of Nyack's distinction as the entertainment capital of Rockland County. Another newcomer getting a mixed reception is a 250-bed drug-treatment center.
Clermont, the unfinished condominiums on the riverbank, was approved in 1985 by officials who have since been voted out of office for just that reason. Phase One, with 41 condominiums, is occupied; only a few floors high, it remains relatively unobtrusive.
But the second phase, with eight floors, looms as a veritable skyscraper. Although virtually complete, the apartments sit empty without generating tax revenue because the developer, Nyack Waterfront Associates, went broke after defaulting on its loans.
Phase Three is unbuilt and tangled up in court. After seeing the size of the second portion, the Village Board of Trustees rezoned its riverfront, limiting the height of buildings to 45 feet.
The financier, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, which is trying to foreclose, has sued the village, saying the zoning change drastically reduced the number of apartments it could build -- and thus its potential profits.
 
2 Views, One of Them Lovely
 The residents of Clermont's completed condominiums do not know how long they will have to live next to a construction site. "They look out one window and see the beautiful Hudson River," said Terry Hekker, a village trustee, "and then they look the other way and see a tangle of weeds, rubble and puddles."
As part of Nyack's metamorphosis over the last 15 years, restaurants, theaters and music clubs moved in, bringing night life to a community that used to close when the sun went down.
For many residents, that night life became a nightmare in August in the form of Fantasy Island, a bar with mirrors, neon and a half dozen women in G-strings gyrating from noon to 4 A.M. Worse, it opened right on Main Street -- across from a Baptist church.
The bar books only top-flight entertainment; a Penthouse cover girl danced there last month, as did Miss Poland of 1990. Most Nyackers seem unimpressed.
 
'It Just Doesn't Belong'
 "I think it's disgraceful," said Lorraine Buono, a village postal clerk. "It just doesn't belong in a small town."
Village officials agreed, and are drafting an ordinance that will control where adults can be entertained in the future.
The village is struggling to reconcile itself with another newcomer: a major drug-treatment center. "The consensus is that it's a wonderful thing, but why does it have to be in our backyard?" said Todd Retallack, who owns a computer graphics business here.
In early 1990, Daytop Village Inc., a nonprofit corporation with 18 drug-treatment centers in New York, bought an ailing motel and banquet hall and undertook a $350,000 renovation.
A few months later, the village won an injunction preventing Daytop from admitting addicts. Nyack argued that Daytop, which is licensed by the state, could not override local zoning laws. "The zone is commercial, and residential-treatment centers are clearly not commercial," Mayor Quinn said.
Late last month, though, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court ruled in Daytop's favor, and Daytop immediately started accepting clients. Nyack is planning to appeal, and is claiming that Daytop is in contempt because it is operating before the issue is settled.
The village government is concerned because the town has lost a major employer; the banquet hall provided about 150 jobs, while Daytop will provide 30 or 40.
Nyack also has a decades-old drug trade, with dealers openly peddling crack at the notorious corner of Franklin Street and Depew Avenue. Some believe that it could prove too great a temptation for those in the treatment center.
"It's like putting a Weight Watchers next to a Ben & Jerry's," said Mrs. Hekker, who is also president of the Nyack Chamber of Commerce.
But for Monsignor William B. O'Brien, the president of Daytop Village, the location is ideal. "It's an isolated site, and that's why the place never flew as a motel," he said. "Across the state, local zoning will not let in any drug-treatment center unless it's on an island with sharks in the water."

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Rose 9.4% In Early June

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 13

 BODY:
An especially strong performance by the General Motors Corporation helped raise sales of domestically built cars and light trucks 9.4 percent in early June.
Although sales are still relatively weak and analysts predict that auto makers may be forced to trim their third-quarter production schedules, the latest numbers suggest that the United States automotive market continues slowly to gain strength. 
 "These numbers give greater confidence that sales may have bottomed, and we're on our way up," said Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company in New York.
Tom Webb, an economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, called the numbers "very encouraging."
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales for the June 1-10 period was 6.3 million, compared with 6.4 million during the corresponding period last year and 6.6 million in late May. Because of variations in seasonal-adjustment factors, comparisons of the annual sales rates do not necessarily correspond to changes in periodic sales figures.
The nine auto makers, made up of American companies and Japanese concerns with North American plants, sold 266,250 vehicles in the period, compared with 243,297 a year ago. This year's total includes an estimate for sales of the Chrysler Corporation, which reports only once a month. Overall car sales were 166,318, a 10 percent increase over last year's 151,157, and light-truck sales were 99,932, an 8.5 percent increase over last year's 92,140.
G.M., the industry leader, posted a 17.8 percent gain in car sales, to 84,570, from 71,810 last year, and an 11.4 percent rise in truck sales, to 41,111, from 36,906 last year.
Arlene Reindel, a spokeswoman for G.M.'s Chevrolet division, said the company sees "a glimmer" of recovery in retail sales, as well as increased fleet sales. She noted that Chevy's 10.6 percent gain partly reflected a comparison with a weak period last year and recent increases in buyer incentives.
The Ford Motor Company's car sales were down 1.4 percent, to 43,017, while truck sales were down two-tenths of 1 percent, to 33,103. Joel Pitcoff, a Ford sales analyst, said sales remained far from robust and showed few signs of a quick recovery. "We're still in a channel, although on the top side of the channel," he said. "I'd feel better when we have a period with a seven million" seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales. Light-truck sales, he said, are showing steady, but slight, improvement.
The Honda Motor Company, the Nissan Motor Company and the Toyota Motor Corporation each had strong gains in sales of American-produced cars. Honda was up 14 percent, to 10,321; Toyota was up 28.7 percent, to 4,943, and Nissan was up 23.5 percent, to 1,874.
A statement from Toyota said sales of its new 1992 Tercel subcompact and new Lexus SC 400 coupe were particularly strong.
 
Need for Cutbacks Is Seen
 Ronald Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter in San Francisco, said that at the current sales rate, auto makers must cut 200,000 vehicles from their scheduled production of 2,234,000 in the three months starting in July.
"Sales are on an upward curve, but not on a vigorous enough rebound to justify what the auto makers are planning," Mr. Glantz said.
Still, Ward's Automotive Reports said the inventory of cars and light trucks had fallen below three million for the first time in eight months, allowing auto makers to keep factories running at a fast pace. This week, for example, 4 plants are idle and 18 are on one-shift operation, out of 80 North American car and truck plants; of the 4 idle plants, 3 were closed for model change-over.
So far this year, auto makers have assembled 4,342,831 vehicles, compared with 5,125,982 last year, a decline of 15.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Rose 0.6% in May

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
Inflation at the wholesale level rose a sharp six-tenths of 1 percent in May, the steepest rise since October, the Labor Department said today.
A 2.4 percent spurt in energy costs, after five months of falling prices, accounted for much of the gain. 
 The sharp increase followed a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent in April and was the highest since a 1.2 percent gain in October.
The May rise brings the wholesale inflation rate for the last 12 months to 3.4 percent; the increase for all of 1990 was 5.7 percent.
After subtracting food and energy costs, which can vary widely each month, the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods still rose at a moderately fast clip of four-tenths of 1 percent, compared with a two-tenths rise in April.
The figures were much higher than expected. Wall Street analysts had generally been predicting a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent in the overall index and two-tenths in the core rate that excludes food and energy.
The acceleration in wholesale inflation as the recession winds down may send warning signals to the Federal Reserve Board, although a change in its monetary policy seems unlikely, analysts said.
The central bank, after easing earlier this year to stimulate growth, has held interest rates steady in recent weeks as evidence mounted that the economy is poised for recovery.
 
Variety of Factors
 Companies resumed hiring in May, car sales turned up again late last month and the housing market is strengthening. The pickup in the inflation rate may be another sign that recession is all but over, as demand arises again, adding to price pressure, analysts said.
But the May report held out some hope for moderation in wholesale inflation in coming months.
The cost of goods in need of further processing fell one-tenth of 1 percent in May after a drop of four-tenths in April. Crude goods, those just entering the refining process, were unchanged after a decline of five-tenths of 1 percent in April.
These declines may provide some relief in the next few finished-goods reports. Still, the biggest influence on the finished index is labor costs, and wages have not retreated notably during this recession.

HEADLINE: Summit Meeting Is Not Expected Before the Fall

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
President Bush's summit meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, originally scheduled for June, is now unlikely to take place until fall, a senior White House official said today.
The talks, which would be held in Moscow, are contingent upon a strategic arms agreement, and the official said that was not yet in sight. 
 If, unexpectedly, Moscow were to accept American proposals in the next few days, Mr. Bush could still travel to the Soviet Union late next month, after the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial democracies meet in London in mid-July and he visits Turkey and Greece, aides said, but they described that as highly improbable.
Mr. Bush will be on vacation in Maine for much of August.
By indicating that the timetable was again slipping for the Moscow meeting, at which Mr. Gorbachev hopes to gain further American aid for his foundering economy, the White House brought new pressure on the Soviets to make an acceptable deal on strategic arms.
 
Meeting With Yeltsin
 At the same time, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, announced that Mr. Bush would meet next Thursday in the Oval Office with Boris N. Yeltsin, who this week became the first popularly chosen president of the Russian republic. He is coming at the invitation of Congressional leaders, so as not to embarrass Mr. Gorbachev, with whom he has publicly clashed, but the senior official said Mr. Yeltsin's conversations with Mr. Bush would be substantive, not perfunctory.
Mr. Yeltsin, a swashbuckling populist who quit the Communist Party, now advocates much more far-reaching reform than Mr. Gorbachev.
"President Gorbachev of course leads the Soviet Union and all the republics and Yeltsin now becomes President of the Russian republic," Mr. Fitzwater said, trying to play down any suggestion of conflict. "Their relationship is pretty well established by law. We don't want to get into a comparison of the two men, but in terms of the process, this election is very important."
But the situation facing Mr. Bush is in fact more complicated than that.
Although the two men have for the moment patched up their differences, a deadly rivalry persists, and President Bush, who has made clear his determination to help Mr. Gorbachev survive, does not want to seem to be favoring Mr. Yeltsin. But at the same time, he cannot appear to snub a man who has just won a stunning popular mandate.
"The fundamental issue," a senior White House aide said, "is that you don't want to weaken the capacity of the system to move forward toward reform. You don't want to undercut the process leading to change, and that process is of course run by the central Government."
The annual conference of the leaders of the seven most powerful industrial democracies -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Britain -- will begin on Monday, July 15, and endwith a joint briefing on Wednesday, July 17. Then, according to an announcement made in London today by Prime Minister John Major, Mr. Gorbachev will have lunch and meet informally with the leaders.
Thus Mr. Gorbachev will not be an official participant in the conference. The United States and Britain at first opposed inviting him at all, but their partners wanted to, and the senior White House official said today that "at some point, the absence of an invitation threatens to skew the agenda more severely than the invitation itself would skew it."

Air War in the Credit Card Battle

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
In its latest counterattack against growing challenges from Visa and Mastercard, the American Express Company said yesterday that it would sharply expand the ways travelers could accumulate frequent-flier credits.
As do competing bank "affinity cards" with ties to airlines, American Express will give its card holders one frequent-flier mile for every dollar they charge on their Green, Gold, Platinum, Optima and Corporate cards. Any purchase, whether it be flowers, sweaters, college tuition or vacations, earns the miles, which are redeemable for free airline tickets or ticket upgrades to first class. 
 But American Express's program, the company's first ever, hopes to spur both business travel and consumer spending, slowed by the recession, by offering some extras. For example, card holders could pool into a kind of "bank" the credits they buy with any version of the American Express card. Charges made on cards of the members' spouses and families count as well. Perhaps most significantly, the card holders could then allocate the pooled credits to as many as seven airlines, instead of one per card, as with present bank-card programs.
The Membership Miles program, as its called, will be free the first year, but will cost $25 the second year.
The arrangements between bank cards and airlines have proved to be one of the most effective marketing tools in the sharply competitive travel and credit card businesses. Competition among credit card issuers of all kinds has risen in recent years, as a glut of cards and a similarity of services, like rental-car damage insurance, have forced issuers to offer more and more incentives for using their particular form of plastic. The recession's effects on both consumers and businesses have intensified that trend.
As the slump hurt the restaurant business, for instance, restaurateurs began to complain about the fee American Express charged merchants who accepted its cards because the percentage was generally higher than that of Visa and Mastercard. Earlier this year, American Express reduced the fee for some merchants.
American Express has not been alone. Last March, Citibank, the nation's largest issuer of Visa and Mastercards, said it would guarantee, through a form of rebate, that purchases of most items using its cards were at the lowest available price.
 
Profits Down
 In April, American Express announced a quarterly profit drop for the Travel-Related Services, which is mainly the credit card business, to $162 million, from $215 million a year earlier. Quarterly charge-card volume fell 1.3 percent, to $25.4 billion.
Company officials cited a white-collar recession that slowed consumer spending and raised bad debts among its generally middle- to upper-class card holders.
"It will be expensive, but necessary," said David F. Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, a credit card industry publication. "American Express needs to increase sales from their upscale customers."
American Express, which once enjoyed nearly all of the market for airline tickets, has been steadily losing business to bank cards affiliated with major airlines. Frequent-flier programs, which flourished in the 1980's, were designed to build customer loyalty to airlines.
The air carriers in the new American Express program are Delta Air Lines, Northwest, Continental, Southwest, MGM Grand Air, Midway and Pan American. They carry nearly half of United States air traffic. In addition, they have 24 affiliated airlines, many of them foreign carriers like KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Singapore Air, which could yield additional travel awards under existing programs.
Delta, which did not previously have an affinity card, said the structure of the American Express program was attractive. "We've always resisted entering these programs, because we just didn't think it was right to get tickets by charging tires and what all," said Neil A. Monroe, a Delta spokesman, "But the difference here is that we're getting paid, which is nice, and we're only one of seven."
 
'Premier Affinity Card'
 American Express program does not include American Airlines and United Airlines, the nation's two largest carriers. Still, experts on frequent-flier incentives hailed the American Express program. "American Express has instantly become the premier affinity card with this program," said Randy Petersen, editor of Frequent, a Colorado Springs, newsletter for frequent travelers.
Joe Brancatelli, executive editor of OAG Frequent Flyer magazine, agreed, but said, referring to the absence of American and United, "Thirty-six percent of my readers won't be able to cash in on it."
Referring to his company's affiliation with American Airlines, James L. Bailey, senior executive in charge of Citibank Visa and Mastercard, said: "This is a marriage. We expect it to be monogamous."
American Airlines agreed. "We're happy with the relationship," said Martin P. Heires, a spokesman for American. Sara Dornacker, a United spokeswoman, said the carrier considered the American Express program a competitor to its own card with First Chicago bank and therefore did not want to participate.
Today, American Express has a nearly 42 percent share of the market for airline tickets, while Visa has nearly 20 percent, according to the Nilson Report.
 
Big Spenders
 The affinity cards appeal strongly to frequent fliers, who tend to spend many times more than typical credit card holders. The Nilson Report estimates that United Airlines' affinity cardholders spend as much as three times more and American Airlines card holders as much as seven times more than a typical gold Visa card holder who spends $2,600 annually.
"Our new program will encourage people to spend as much as possible with American Express," said Kenneth I. Chenault, president of the consumer card group.
Typically, under these programs, a bank buys frequent-flier miles, at a penny or less per mile, from the airlines. American Express may pay cash but could also trade services, like cooperative advertising, to reduce expenses for the program, which analysts said could be costly in its first years.
Mr. Chenault would say only that "American Express is not structuring this program as a loss leader," meaning a money-losing incentive.

Predicting When Upturn Will Start

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
ECONOMISTS once thought that by using computers and large-scale econometric models, they could develop tools for more accurate forecasting. But such hopes have given way to the more humble belief that the best they can do is to state what they think are the odds on various possible developments ("scenarios" in the current economic jargon). The problem of macroeconomic forecasting has been made even more difficult by the complex interactions between national economies and the world economy.
Prof. Rudiger Dornbusch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says the world economy is now in the midst of a "significant slowdown," with outright recession in the Anglo-Saxon countries and minimal growth in Europe, except Germany. Only Asia is keeping up the momentum of world growth, but even there Japan's growth rate is slipping below 4 percent. 
 The most important questions about the world economy, he says, focus on the United States and Germany: Will the United States come out of the recession in the next few months, and can Germany resolve its inflation problem before a sharp slowdown sets in and topples the rest of continental Europe? He lays out three "plausible scenarios:"
*Optimistic: The American recession touched bottom in the April-June quarter and the recovery is starting. Germany cuts its interest rates this summer and Europe enters an upswing by late fall. (30 percent probability).
*Pessimistic: The United States recession is far more durable than the consensus of economists expects, because taxes are too high, debt keeps consumers and businesses from buying durable goods and the Federal Reserve is too slow and provides inadequate stimulus to turn the economy around. Germany's inflation proves a hard nut to crack. There's a serious chance of world recession by fall and no turnaround before the middle of next year. (20 percent probability).
*Central scenario: The United States recovery is about ready to start. Germany, preoccupied with inflation, lets Europe slip to the edge of recession. The disparity between a recovering United States economy and a declining Europe puts upward pressure on the dollar, complicating Europe's inflation problem and slowing American growth down the road. (50 percent probability).
These three add up to 100 percent, implying that no other outcome is possible. For different combinations of United States recession and recovery, Professor Dornbusch sets up a grid of four probabilities: deep recession-weak recovery, 5 percent; shallow recession-weak recovery, 50 percent; deep recession-strong recovery, 15 percent; shallow recession-strong recovery, 30 percent.
Most other economists' forecasts fall within the shallow recession-weak recovery scenario. Thus, Blue Chip Economic Indicators' June 1991 survey of 52 economists finds more than 8 out of 10 predicting an end to the recession by August (with nearly 4 out of 10 saying it ended in April or May). And the Blue Chip consensus forecasts a 1992 growth rate of real G.N.P. of just 2.7 percent, a recovery so weak as to mean virtually no change in unemployment. The top 10 of the Blue Chip forecasters average real economic growth of 3.5 percent next year, and the bottom 10 average 1.9 percent growth. None of the 52 surveyed see either a boom or a crash in '92.
The world economy appears weak but not hopeless in the eyes of its beholders. The Conference Board, drawing on indexes compiled by Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle Research, finds that the global business cycle continues to show "widespread but moderate recessionary trends." The board's composite leading index for 11 major industrial countries is declining at an annual rate of 3 percent.
But that rate of decline represents a one percentage point improvement from three months ago. "You have to look carefully, but there are a few signs of optimism scattered among the data," says Edgar R. Fiedler, vice president and economic counselor of the board. "The indications of a turnaround are not strong enough to suggest that a recovery in the global business cycle is around the corner, but they do relieve the gloom somewhat."
For the developing countries, the World Bank offers three scenarios: a "baseline scenario" that is moderately better than the "lost decade" of the 1980's; a "low-case scenario," with turbulence in international trading and financial systems and a much higher level of real interest rates, and a "high-case scenario," in which challenges are successfully met, reducing uncertainty and spurring further integration of the global economy.
"The plausible range of growth estimates for the developing countries in the 1990's is therefore wide: from less than 3 percent a year to well over 6 percent," says the World Bank report on Global Economic Prospects. "This range translates into a 40 percent difference in the level of real income by the year 2000."
That's a big spread, like those in other probabilistic forecasting scenarios. Given the economic, financial and political interests of most forecasters, their collective bias is toward minimizing anxiety and maximizing hope. But there are the constraints of the facts. The real payoff in forecasting is to be right.

J. C. Penney Fires Ayer After 8 Years and Hires Bozell

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
THE J. C. Penney Company yesterday abruptly dismissed Ayer Inc., its agency for eight years, and hired Bozell Inc.
Executives of the nation's fourth-largest retailer said the change, effective Oct. 1, was unrelated to the quality of Ayer's award-winning work. Instead, they said, they were drawn to the abilities of Bozell/Southwest, as Bozell's Dallas office is known. 
 While "we've been very pleased over the years with our relationship with Ayer," Robert B. Gill, Penney's vice chairman and chief operating officer, said in a telephone interview from Dallas, "the main thrust is that the resources down here available to us through Bozell are substantially larger and more in depth than what we could have."
At 450 employees, Bozell/Southwest's office is 10 times the size of Ayer's office in Dallas, which opened in 1988 to serve Penney after the retailer moved its corporate headquarters from New York.
Though Mr. Gill said the recession was not a factor in Penney's decision to change agencies, the soft retail environment is slowing Penney's ambitious program to change the company's image among shoppers. Once a plain-vanilla merchandiser of everything from ties to tires, Penney has in the last decade strived to transform itself into a modish national department-store chain concentrating on apparel. But during the recession, Penney's same-store sales growth has been hurt as many of its present or potential customers turned to discount retailers.
Penney's sales this year "have been disappointing, as have those for most of the recession-sensitive retail industry," said a memo distributed to Ayer employees. "At times like this, an advertising agency's prior record of success is easily forgotten."
A national image campaign that Ayer created soon after it became Penney's agency in 1983, "You're looking smarter than ever," is credited by retail analysts as helping change consumer perceptions of Penney. A replacement campaign, "Fashion comes to life." was introduced last year.
Penney's billings this year were to total $45.6 million, said Ayer's New York-based top executives, who are deeply disappointed by yet another large account loss. And the timing could not have been worse: Penney's announcement came as another client, The National Sports Daily, announced that it was going out of business.
"We've had nothing but praise from Penney," Jerry J. Siano, Ayer's chairman and chief executive, said at a news conference in his Manhattan office. "It's discouraging. It's just not understandable. What else can I say?" Mr. Siano and Thomas F. Maxey, vice chairman, deferred questions about the fate of their Dallas employees, who might seek additional accounts there to add to a now bittersweet recent addition, the Dallas Chamber of Commerce.
Penney's shift brings to an estimated $600 million the value of the important national accounts being reassigned, or placed in review, since the recession began in July. Almost every client involved in this unusual spate of switching finds itself fighting fiercely for ever-scarcer consumer dollars. Among them: American Isuzu Motors, Avis, Club Med, Reebok, Subaru of America and Vons supermarkets.
At Ayer, Penney's loss is the latest in a skein exceeding $200 million, including Burger King, Continental Airlines and Citicorp's New York branch banking.
"It's no secret that Bozell has been courting the business ever since Penney moved from New York to Dallas," Mr. Maxey said. Bozell last year was named Penney's agency for a cable television shopping channel that was later discontinued.
 Liener Temerlin, Bozell's chairman, chuckled at a characterization of Bozell as nipping at Ayer's heels for Penney's favor. During a telephone interview from Dallas, where he is based, Mr. Temerlin described Bozell as having tried "to let them know who we are and what we can do." The cable account "gave us a chance to flex some creative muscles," he added. The Penney victory gives Bozell/Southwest the accounts of four of the five largest corporations with Dallas headquarters, Mr. Temerlin said, including American Airlines and Texas Instruments. And it brings Bozell/Southwest billings to $380 million, he added. That is very close to the billings of the largest of Bozell's nine full-service United States offices, the New York headquarters office.
In addition to the spending coordinated through Penney's agency, the retailer also spends an estimated $275 million a year on advertising, like circulars, created in-house. Penney's total spending, at around $320 million, makes it the nation's 27th-largest advertiser.

HEADLINE: Some Signs Of Rebound In Economy

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Consumers came back to the malls in May, and fewer people filed unemployment claims in the third week of the month, according to Government reports released yesterday. Many economists reacted by declaring that the recession had ended and that the economy had begun to recover.
"Consumers led the economy into recession," said James E. Annable, chief economist at First National Bank of Chicago. "They almost certainly led us out this spring," 
 President Bush's chief economic adviser, Michael J. Boskin, was more circumspect: "It appears that we have begun to see early signs of a recovery, but we will need to see continued improvement in the data before we can be absolutely sure. The recovery won't occur at the same time and pace for all sectors of the economy."
 
Some Inflation Worries
 The auto sector showed signs of health in early June, with sales up nearly 10 percent. But the upbeat mood was dampened by some inflation worries arising from a report yesterday that wholesale prices increased six-tenths of 1 percent last month, about twice the rate analysts had expected. [Page D4.]
Still, now that the burning question of when the recession will end has been settled in many economists' minds, attention has abruptly shifted to the probable strength and durability of a recovery.
The consensus leans toward a rather benign outlook: a moderate upswing for the first several quarters of the expansion. Growth would be far slower than in the average recovery but speedy enough to whittle down the unemployment rate.
A bit of dissent has come from Federal Reserve officials, including Alan Greenpsan, the chairman, who have suggested in recent days that the chief risk to the consensus forecast is that the economy could bounce back more robustly.
 
Fear of Sluggishness
 A more widespread worry, however, is that growth will be so sluggish that joblessness will continue creeping up into 1992, said Martin S. Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research. That could happen if annual growth is much below 2.5 percent or 3 percent, and if, as typically happens when the economy emerges from recession, many more Americans start hunting for jobs.
"I am concerned that the recovery may not be sustainable," Mr. Feldstein said.
For now, however, confident consumers are reaching into their pockets again. According to the Commerce Department's preliminary report on May retail sales, spending surged 1 percent before adjusting for inflation.
Consumers spent freely on clothing and furniture, two categories not strictly considered necessities, said James S. Fralick, an economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. Spending on clothing shot up 2.4 percent; furniture, 1.5 percent, and on department-store items, seven-tenths of 1 percent.
The implication of all these figures is that consumer spending, in inflation-adjusted terms, turned positive for the first time since last summer.
 
Analyzing the Price Data
 The weekly report on unemployment claims showed a sharp drop, to 401,000, the lowest since January. The report was yet another sign that the labor market has stabilized and that consumers' income is rising, said Mr. Annable of First Chicago.
Yesterday's report on producer prices was not as dreadful as it looked at first glance. Most of the six-tenths of 1 percent jump in May reflected a surge in energy and food prices, the Government reported.
The core rate, which excludes food and energy costs, was up four-tenths of 1 percent, but about half of that could be traced to a seasonal rise in tobacco prices that Mr. Boskin and several private economists called a one-time increase.
Nevertheless, the price report disappointed those seeking evidence that the recession had cooled inflation, which has been bobbing around an annual rate of 4.5 percent for several years.
Until there is evidence that such price increases will not be repeated in coming months, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to ease monetary policy further. The central bank last eased in late April.

HEADLINE: NCR Revamping A.T.& T. Computer Unit

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The dismantling of A.T.& T.'s computer business began yesterday, as Gilbert P. Williamson, the president of NCR, told the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's computer systems sales force that the companies' combined computer business would be based on NCR computers introduced last fall.
Mr. Williamson said no decisions had been made on how many jobs would be cut because of the merger of the companies. Last month, after a five-month takeover battle, NCR agreed to be acquired by the phone company for $7.48 billion in stock. 
 Although the deal is not expected to be completed until the fall, the companies have been working aggressively to meld their operations. A.T.& T. has lost several billion dollars in the computer business in the last six years, and NCR, the nation's fifth-largest computer company, was expected to dominate the computer operations.
"For this merger to work, these guys have to move fast and make decisions quickly, and they are doing that," said Wes Melling, an analyst at the Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn.
People who follow the computer industry said the phone company was allowing NCR executives a considerable degree of control in setting the strategy.
"It is interesting to see how NCR has been able to hang on to a lot of key technologies at the expense of some of the A.T.& T. technologies," said Stuart Woodring, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
For instance, both the phone company and NCR have actively been promoting software systems designed to manage the flow of data at large corporations. The NCR software package, called Cooperation, will be offered by the combined company; A.T.& T.'s Rhapsody software will not. Cooperation, however, will incorporate some elements of Rhapsody, which A.T.& T. spent years developing.
"It is surprising that a parent who is essentially acquiring another company would agree to such a drastic change of long-term strategy," Mr. Woodring said.
NCR said it would continue to support existing A.T.& T. computers, while converting customers to NCR systems over the next several years. But analysts said some customers might choose to switch suppliers.
Several A.T.& T. products, including the Safari, a recently introduced and well-regarded laptop computer, and some A.T.& T. equipment for building data networks, will play a role in the combined company.
Merging high-technology companies has not always gone well, but so far, analysts said, the phone company was doing a good job.
"There is the question of the emotional investment in products as well as political ramifications," Mr. Woodring said. "A.T.& T. did a great job of keeping those things to a minimum."

HEADLINE: Bargain Pitched to the West: $100 Billion for Soviet Reform

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
If the West really wants the Soviet Union to plunge into democratic capitalism, a team of Soviet and American scholars says, it should be prepared to cushion the shock with at least $100 billion in aid over five years.
The team's proposal for a "grand bargain" -- large-scale aid tied to a radical transformation of the Soviet Government and economy -- is to be delivered to the White House and the Kremlin this weekend. 
 A group of experts on revamping socialist economies cobbled the plan together over the last few weeks at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. They have no formal ties with their governments, and neither President Mikhail S. Gorbachev nor the leaders of the Western alliance have even endorsed the concept.
But with the Soviet economy in a free fall and the nation fracturing along a dozen ethnic lines, this initial detailed version of the grand bargain is bound to be the subject of spirited debate at the economic summit meeting of the leading Western industrialized nations in July.
 
Pressure for Democracy
 The proposal, parts of which were outlined in the Financial Times, requires the Soviet Union to honor its commitments to democracy and decentralization to qualify for aid. The Government has promised to hold democratic elections next year and to seek a division of political authority acceptable to republics that choose to stay in the union.
Jeffrey Sachs, one of two American economists in the group and an architect of the "shock therapy" plan adopted by Poland, said in an interview that no reform would work unless the republics conceded a need to adopt a common currency and guarantee free movement of people, goods and resources across the nation.
Moscow would also need to retain its power to control the money supply, regulate foreign trade and raise revenue.
Soviet policy makers would also be encouraged to move promptly to prevent economic chaos. The Harvard group wants the Kremlin to raise consumer prices now to relieve chronic shortages and to reduce ballooning budget deficits. The group also wants a speedy Soviet commitment to privatize small businesses, which could fill some of the needs no longer met by collapsing state enterprises.
No Western aid would be provided for six to nine months while the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank studied the Soviet economy in detail. Once international lenders can collect reliable economic statistics, they would provide cash to cushion the blow of overnight changes. A critical first step is to break inflation by cutting Government subsidies and preventing state banks from printing money to cover the deficits of Soviet enterprises.
 
Market Reforms
 With a few exceptions, notably in the energy sector, price controls would be lifted. Subsistence living standards would be guaranteed by rationing very limited quantities of consumer staples at heavily subsidized prices. Those who wanted more than, say, a few pounds of sugar a month, would have to pay the full cost in rubles.
The ruble would be made freely convertible into foreign currencies at an exchange rate that would give Soviet enterprises at least a chance to compete in global markets. To prevent a run against the ruble, international lenders would back the Soviet currency with a multibillion-dollar line of credit.
Stanley Fischer, the former chief economist of the World Bank and the other American economist in the planning group, sees this dash to convertibility as crucial to broader reforms. Early access to imported goods, he said, would send signals on realistic prices to the country's domestic producers, who have never been able to calculate their costs. Competition from imports would also help deter huge Soviet enterprises from exploiting their monopoly power.
 
Loans at Competitive Rates
 State banks would be required to act like profit-making institutions, offering loans at competitive interest rates to public and private enterprises. In most cases, enterprises that were not creditworthy would be allowed to fail.
The planners assume that such shock therapy would lead to a sharp fall in production. And with the Government out of the business of wholesale distribution, some of what is produced might never make it to market. Much of the Western aid provided in the first few years would be needed to fill the gaps, for example, through imports of consumer staples and scarce industrial parts.
With all of the major reforms adopted, the initial shock would last about two and a half years. Then the emphasis would shift to nurturing the market economy through its infancy.
While some industrial giants might be privatized in the first few years, Eastern Europe's experience suggests that the process is far too difficult and politically sensitive to complete rapidly. To end monopolies, the largest enterprises would be broken up before their shares were parceled out to the public.
 
Loans for Nation's Arteries
 The focus of aid would change by the third year from covering deficits in the Soviet balance of payments to providing project loans. Much of the cash would support improvements that could not attract private capital from abroad, like pollution control, transportation and telecommunications projects, Mr. Sachs suggested.
The appeal of a dramatic rescue effort has grown in the last few months as the Soviet economy has unraveled and half-measures have failed. But the grand bargain still faces bitter opposition from many quarters.
Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, an influential voice in the legislative debate on Soviet issues, sees it as throwing good money after bad. It would be "an act of delusion," he said last week, to send more American wheat to Moscow when less than half of the grain grown in the Soviet Union reaches consumers.
Like many academic specialists, Padma Desai, an economist at Columbia University's Harriman Institute, thinks the grand bargain is "neither feasible nor necessary." She wonders why the dying Soviet empire rates such generosity. Ms. Desai believes that large-scale aid would come at the expense of more worthy developing economies in Latin America, Africa and Asia.
 
Penny-Wise Objections?
 Graham Allison and Robert Blackwill, political scientists at the Kennedy School and members of the planning group, dismiss these arguments as penny-wise.
"The Soviet Union is and will remain a great power," they write in the current issue of Foreign Affairs. They argue that the cost of the grand bargain pales beside the costs of defending American interests against a hostile military giant.
In any case, Mr. Sachs said, the costs of the plan must be put into perspective. A $100 billion package amounts to roughly the same amount of aid per person as the current Western aid commitment to Eastern Europe.
He argues that only small results can be expected if Western aid amounts to small change. A dribble of cash here, a trade benefit there, he thinks, will only delay the commissars' day of reckoning.

HEADLINE: Bill Is Passed To Extend Regulations For Rents

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 13

 BODY:
Resisting a strong push from landlord groups to revise the laws that limit rent increases on one million apartments in New York City and some surrounding counties, lawmakers approved a bill today that simply extends the current regulations for two years.
In what has become something of a spring ritual here every two years, the extension of the rent-stabilization law remained in limbo until the 11th hour. Officials said there were never any serious questions about the protections remaining in force for the vast majority of rent-stabilized apartments. 
 But this year there was more discussion than in the past about "luxury decontrol" of certain higher-priced apartments, like those renting for more than $1,000 a month.
Landlords have lobbied strongly for such changes, arguing that the current laws give an unnecessary subsidy to many wealthy New Yorkers and that decontrol would help the city's budget problems by bringing in more tax revenue from higher rents.
 
Bitter Opposition
 "There's $100 million out there," John J. Gilbert 3d, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlord group that has sued to end some of the rent laws, said, referring to his estimate of the increased taxes. Under decontrol, landlords would be free to charge whatever the market would bear.
But such proposals have run into bitter opposition from tenant groups and the Democratic-led State Assembly, who say many New Yorkers living in $1,000-a-month apartments would not qualify as wealthy.
Noting the declining economy, the Assembly's Housing Committee chairman, Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat, said, "This is not the year to be playing chicken with people's security in their homes."
Although there seems to be some sympathy for landlord concerns in the Republican-controlled State Senate, the six Republican Senators from New York City argued vigorously for the extension. Senator Roy M. Goodman, Republican of Manhattan, said there might eventually be consideration of decontrol but only "for those who are clearly of the Rolls-Royce-Country Club set" who do not need the benefits of rent stabilization.
The regulated rent market is divided into two categories: controlled and stabilized. The great majority of apartments are rent-stabilized, with the state setting a percentage limit on annual rent increases based on an operating-costs index. The regulations give tenants broad rights on renewing their leases. Besides New York City, the stabilization law applies to Nassau, Rockland and Westchester Counties.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said he would sign the measure into law, meaning that tenant protections like caps on rent increases would continue. Without legislative action, the regulations would have expired this weekend.
Partly because of the high emotions that surround the issue, the issue of extending the rent regulations has virtually always remained unsettled until the last moment.
Six years ago, in fact, lawmakers acted so late that Governor Cuomo had to use the hood of a state trooper's car that rushed to an Albany airport runway, where he had just arrived, to sign the extension into law minutes before the regulations would have expired.

BYLINE: By Bryan Miller

 BODY:

Le Cygne
 These are tough times for restaurants like Le Cygne. It is not a hip inexpensive bistro, a cool jet-set roost, a cultish hangout or a splashy media darling. Le Cygne has been simply a fine -- and expensive -- French restaurant that attempts to fly the flag high in this economic tempest.
 
 Le Cygne is one of the most underrated haute dining spots in New York City. For those who appreciate classically rooted contemporary French cuisine, it deserves to be high on the list. Such an exemplary performance is not surprising, for Le Cygne has been cosseted by its founding partners, Gerard Gillian and Michel Crouzillat, for 22 years. The kitchen is under the direction of Jean-Michel Bergougnoux, formerly of Le Regence and Lutece.
 The restaurant is in a two-story town house with a cheerful post-modern decor. The main dining room is in cool tones of gray and blue highlighted by white columns and ceiling trim; Impressionistic flower murals are softly illuminated, adding a blaze of color. One upstairs room has a similar theme; a brick-walled wine den is used for private parties. Noise is rarely a problem.
 Mr. Bergougnoux's spring-summer menu has an engaging Provencal accent. For starters, there is soupe au pistou, the country-style vegetable soup. In his city-slicker version, which is as thick as a stew, there are fresh peas, tomatoes, carrots and potatoes. Surprisingly, it is garnished with shrimp. Authentic? No. Delicious? Yes.
Two other light and flavorful starters are haricots verts with crushed hazelnuts and excellent shrimp salad, and a salad of heavily smoked duck and a slice of foie gras over mixed greens. Ravioli filled with mushrooms and lobster float on a luxuriant sauce flavored with rosemary, garlic, mushrooms and olives, and smoked salmon is sublime atop a pancake of potatoes and candied onions with creme fraiche and salmon caviar. With such delicate triumphs on the menu, it was surprising to taste forgettable crab cakes and zucchini flowers stuffed with a bland mixture of mushrooms and chicken mousse.
 The captains and waiters at Le Cygne remain a sharp, intelligent team. They never hover, but they are always in the neighborhood when you need them. The wine list, moderate in size, is well chosen but expensive.
 Mr. Bergougnoux has conjured up some spring seafood dishes that are not to be missed. In one, he takes thin slices of tuna and alternates them with layers of sliced potatoes flavored with vinegar and liberal doses of pepper. It is all enhanced with a wonderful sauce of black trumpet mushrooms. A lunch dish was was equally good: broiled salmon paillard over a sauce of periwinkle brine and olive oil, garnished with fennel, diced tomatoes, chopped dill and coriander.
A special, roasted sea bass, was flappingly fresh, crisp-skinned and moist, presented over savoy cabbage with a tasty salad of cellophane noodles and seaweed.
 On the meat side, a superb composition is medium-rare lamb medallions wrapped in seaweed and seasoned with cardamom. They are set over a rich lamb stock embellished with toasted almonds, along with an almond flan and sliced artichokes. Filet mignon comes in a heady white-truffle sauce, and roast chicken comes with creamy mashed potatoes and cepes. Duck is expertly prepared, too, its blistered skin concealing succulent pink meat. Spatzle and carrot puree seem to be wintery accompaniments, but beguiling ones.
 As you order appetizers and main courses, a captain hands you a dessert menu to consider certain sweets that take time to prepare. I have never liked this practice, necessary though it may be, for it strikes me as asking a college freshman to declare his major before he has taken his first class. Souffles, which are nearly all airy egg white, are worth pre-ordering, whether Grand Marnier, chocolate or raspberry. Something called warm bitter chocolate and mint tart is the kind of dessert you dream about, while the fragile-crusted apple tart, glistening and browned at the edges, is one of the best I have ever tasted. What is called a clafoutis, traditionally a custardlike base with fruit, is a buttery round cake with pineapple in the center -- delicious nonetheless.
For more than two decades, Le Cygne has been a place for romance, for celebration and for blissful indulgence. That is more true today than ever.
 
Scaletta
 In some other parts of town, the two-and-a-half-year-old Scaletta would be another inconspicuous local spot. But on the Upper West Side, where quality Italian dining is as rare as Buddhist temples, it has achieved some prominence.
The step-down dining room is incongruous in this neighborhood, both for its large size and for its appearance. Scaletta is awash in soothing colors like dusty rose and cream. It has faux frosted windows, beige upholstered chairs with turquoise cushions, arches, pillars and plenty of elbow room. As one fellow diner remarked, "It looks like the breakfast room of a fancy California hotel."
 Appetizers are particularly good. Baked clams, so often a wad of oil-drizzled bread crumbs, are lightly breaded here, full of clam flavor and well seasoned. Calamari is superior, too, floured and cleanly deep-fried. I rarely order baked oysters, for almost invariably they are dehydrated and tasteless. An exception is Scaletta's baked bluepoint oysters garnished with a thin slice of salmon and pimento. The flavors meld nicely, and all the briny oyster juices remain.
 A salad of haricots verts, mozzarella and pimentos could not be faulted for quality of ingredients, but it needed a jolt of salt and pepper or herbs to enliven it. The cheesy, garlic-laced Caesar salad is better. And carpaccio of beef is a paragon, lean and thin sliced, cool but not icy, served over arugula salad with mustard dressing.
 I don't know if it has something to do with the weather or the season, but in the last few weeks I have encountered some extraordinarily sluggish service all over town. Several of the friendly but phlegmatic crew here, dressed in blue shirts and dark ties, consider a diner's first request for an item merely rhetorical. A second request usually gets (leisurely) action.
 Pastas sound appealing, but most sampled fell short for lack of seasoning or inaccurate cooking time. Green and white fettuccine with tomato, spinach and chunks of fresh salmon was a harmonious combination, but the pasta was starchy. The same fault was evident in a special of black pasta with tomato and shrimp, and in the fettuccine with salmon in a vodka-spiked tomato-cream sauce.
 While the kitchen goes down swinging in the pasta department, it does turn out top-notch gnocchi, light and resilient in a seductive Bolognese sauce. Seafood risotto is arresting, too, the firm-cooked rice replete with perfectly cooked scallops, shrimp and clams in a light basil-tomato base. Seafood entrees are reliable, among them broiled salmon steak and swordfish Livornese (with capers, parsley, black olives and tomato). Charcoal-broiled tuna, though, looked as if it had been cooked at the barbecue by a gregarious dad who was paying more attention to his guests than to his cooking. You would do well with the breast of chicken with garlic, lemon and balsamic vinegar, or the special of chicken breast topped with eggplant and mozzarella. If you want veal, the scaloppine with butter and lemon is better than the veal with a pesto sauce with whole pine nuts and sun-dried tomatoes, whose flavors clash.
Scaletta's selection of mostly Italian and American wines is modest but adequate and fairly priced.
 Coffee semifreddo, flavored frozen whipped cream, is the best way to end a meal here. Chocolate Parisien cake, made with a chocolate sponge cake, is a second option. Also available are creamy lemon sorbet, served in a hollowed-out lemon, and a wonderful pastry layered with fresh berries. Most of the other desserts are cloyingly sweet.
 Scaletta is the kind of place where you can do very well by learning the menu and sticking to favorites. It's not the ideal way to dine, but in this part of town, one should be grateful for small blessings.

HEADLINE: Rocking or Relaxed, It's Still the Blues

BYLINE: By KAREN SCHOEMER

 BODY:
BLUES clubs in New York City are a strange breed, many generations removed from the music's ancestral home in the plantations and juke joints of the rural South. Back in the 1930's and 40's, blues was an expression of social, political and economic disenfranchisement; it was music primarily about sadness and anger and pain, and it was structured, worded and performed as an explicit antidote to those emotions.
Like many American traditions, blues has since been adopted and reshaped by and for mass culture; it has been modernized and technologized and commercialized into something that's perhaps more about style than about feeling. While some blues musicians of the 1940's and 50's still tour today, performing the music much as they did decades ago, young bar bands play a kind of blues that's hopped up with rock-and-roll rhythms, good to dance to and fun to listen to -- the archetypal music to hear live on a Saturday night on the town. 
 New York blues clubs retain this juxtaposition of the old and the new, the historical and the contemporary. On any given night on Bleecker Street's club row, you're just as likely to find a hot young band doing a tribute to the blues-influenced Eric Clapton as a solo performer onstage with a bottleneck slide doing a 1930's Robert Johnson song like "Crossroads." Blues clubs don't want to forget the roots of blues, but they also don't want to forget that people like to go out and stomp and holler and drink fancy drinks through colored straws, maybe even shoot a game of pool -- the only real diversion from the music in most of these clubs. Owners know that blues, in any of its incarnations, can be the ideal sound track for such an evening.
On page C22 is a selection of six blues clubs catering to these varying needs. Some allow a brush with the past; others create no more than a good time in the present. But all, in one way or another, recognize that basic impulse to conquer sadness by celebrating it in song.

HEADLINE: Needless Bankruptcy in Bridgeport

 BODY:
When a city like Bridgeport, Conn., goes bankrupt, the failure is as much political as financial. Like many cities, Bridgeport is in deep trouble. Some of the causes are local, some not. But Bridgeport's petition for court protection is extreme. Public officials are elected to solve problems, not walk away from them.
Federal law lets municipalities file for bankruptcy when state law allows that. Congress did not intend this as an easy way out but as a last resort. Unlike corporate bankruptcy, municipal bankruptcy leaves a city government largely in control. But for populous cities, this is uncharted territory. 
 While bankruptcy might help solve Bridgeport's short-term problems, it would damage the city's creditworthiness. Meanwhile it casts a shadow on creditors and suppliers, city employees and residents, the state and other troubled cities.
In the 13 years since the municipal bankruptcy code was updated, dozens of entities have taken this route, mostly water and utility districts and a few school boards. Cities have rarely done it, and none the size of Bridgeport. Fearful of the financial and political risks, city fathers tend to back off; usually they scare themselves and their creditors and unions into negotiating sustainable new arrangements. Indeed, Bridgeport may be bluffing now. State officials argue that it exaggerates its crisis.
The city's problems are not new. All of southwestern Connecticut once thrived on manufacturing, now mostly gone. Recently, like central cities elsewhere, Bridgeport has also suffered from shrinking Federal and state aid, white flight to suburbs, rising welfare and the recession, which has hit the Northeastern states hardest.
Cities need more help, from Washington and the states. But Bridgeport's government has failed, too; financial management has been slipshod. Since 1988 it has been under the surveillance of a state-imposed financial review board -- but has ignored the board's warnings and advice.
Court approval of Bridgeport's filing is by no means certain; the state is fighting it, on grounds that no city may file without state approval. If the Federal bankruptcy court approves, the city's fate will be carefully tracked by troubled communities nationwide. Municipal bankruptcy is an experiment fraught with risk.

HEADLINE: What Potential Presidential TV Debates Have!

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I strongly disagree with Tom Wicker's assertion in "High Noon, Low Hype" (column, May 22) that Presidential debates have little or no value to the American voter. 
 Without debates, a voter's only exposure to Presidential candidates is through television commercials, bumper stickers and 10-second sound bites on the evening news. True, voters will receive this superficial campaign publicity anyway, but without debates, there may otherwise be no opportunity for the candidates to confront important issues directly.
Without debates candidates could just as easily avoid issues altogether. Would-be Presidents could simply address the importance of "family values," the necessity of a "strong economy" and the evils of his opponent. Debates, however, force candidates to define their national agenda and defend that agenda in front of the entire nation.
Past Presidential debates have not answered my every question about the candidates. Indeed, they often generate more questions about candidates and issues than they seem to answer. But at least they challenge the candidates to address national issues, while challenging the public to face these issues as well. When voters are only exposed to television smear ads or "feel good" commercials, featuring images of grandchildren or waving flags, neither the public nor the candidates are challenged.
Mr. Wicker concludes that from 1960 to 1976 the United States "got along quite well without Presidential debates." The Vietnam War, however, was never debated publicly between the Presidential candidates in 1960, '64, '68 or '72. I think it should have been. And in 1972, Richard M. Nixon was never forced to defend his bombing of Cambodia or the corruption in his Administration by participating in a debate with George McGovern. He should have been.
The worst our nation could have suffered from such debates was a better understanding of the candidates and issues. And had those debates taken place, our recent history might have been spared the damage that the Vietnam, Cambodia and Watergate episodes have since inflicted.
Then again, maybe Presidential debates in those years would have had little or no affect on history. All we know is that the potential benefit of Presidential debates to the American people, whether that potential is fully realized or not, is of great national value.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
A Change in Top Post For Marine Midland

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Marine Midland Banks, hurt by losses from bad loans, announced yesterday that John R. H. Bond, a top executive of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation would replace Geoffrey A. Thompson, who was resigning, as Marine's chief executive.
Marine Midland, which has been controlled by Hongkong and Shanghai since 1980 and is the largest foreign-owned bank in the United States, has long been a source of vexation for its parent company. John M. Gray, deputy chairman of Hongkong and Shanghai, said recently that "we still believe that our strategy of buying an American bank is correct" but acknowledged that the execution "was very bad." 
 Mr. Bond, an Englishman who is 49 years old, is an executive director of Hongkong and Shanghai. He is generally regarded as the third-highest-ranking officer in the bank and as a specialist in corporate lending. Since joining the bank in 1961, he has spent time in Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia and was the chief executive for the Americas from 1987 to 1990.
As chief officer for the Americas, Mr. Bond became familiar with Marine Midland's operations but was not in control of the bank. He plans to live in Buffalo, Marine Midland's headquarters, with his wife and three children.
Between 1980 and 1988, when Hongkong and Shanghai owned just 48 percent of Marine Midland, Mr. Gray noted that the American managers were slow to abandon their hope of becoming a larger bank with major operations overseas and across the United States. Soon after Hongkong and Shanghai acquired 100 percent of the company in 1988, "we were hit by the recession and all the problems that caused."
Last year, Marine's problems with bad loans led to a $295 million loss, which required Hongkong and Shanghai to supply $300 million of additional capital. In the first quarter of this year, Marine announced another loss of $72.3 million.
Under Mr. Thompson, an American who became chairman in 1988 after joining the bank in 1981, Marine Midland had been retrenching and pulling back from many businesses outside its consumer banking and lending to medium-sized companies.
"At the moment, Europe is our key effort, and developing our presence there has a higher priority than expanding our U.S. business," Mr. Gray said in an interview.
The sale of nonessential businesses plus the reluctance of Hongkong and Shanghai to pay for big new acquisitions have reduced Marine Midland's assets to just under $19 billion, from $27.1 billion at the end of 1989.

Lockheed Unit Sets 800 More Job Cuts

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SUNNYVALE, Calif., June 14

 BODY:
The Lockheed Missiles and Space Company will cut 800 more jobs this year than it had expected and warned that further reductions could occur. The military contractor, hurt by cancellations and reductions of orders on several programs, said Thursday that cuts would probably include 470 layoffs. The remainder would come as retirements and resignations.
Most cuts will occur in Silicon Valley, where the company is the largest employer, but operaions in other states would also be affected, a company spokesman said. The Lockheed Corporation, based in the Los Angeles suburb of Calabasas, has nearly 21,000 employees in its Sunnyvale division, the largest within the company. 
 At the start of the year, Lockheed predicted it would cut 1,200 jobs in 1991 and so far it has cut 950 positions. Additional cuts would bring the total to 2,000, the company said.

HEADLINE: Your Taxes;
I.R.S. Maps Out Big Leap Forward

BYLINE: By Robert D. Hershey Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Although grandiose plans often go awry, even partial success for the Internal Revenue Service's $8 billion modernization effort, disclosed this week, will bring visibly big improvements for the nation's 100 million-plus taxpayers.
Did you misplace the copy of the return you filed last year ago just when you need to document an application for college financial aid? The I.R.S., which now has a 45-day target to respond to such requests but misses it in one case out of three, expects to be able to supply a copy within 24 hours. 
 Does it drive you into a frenzy to respond properly to an I.R.S. request for additional information or money only to get a computer-generated enforcement notice three weeks later about the same issue? The service proposes to eliminate 95 percent of such erroneous dunning.
Are you weary of being shunted around from one place to another to resolve a problem, dealing with I.R.S. personnel with ready access to only 2 percent of your account information? The agency anticipates that in 95 percent of cases a single employee will be able fix things.
But not right away.
The master plan, three years in development, will be phased in throughout the 1990's, replacing a system designed in the late 1950's and using the technology of the 1960's. The way the I.R.S. receives, processes and manages tax data has remained basically unchanged since.
At the news briefing on the plan, Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. called it a revolution. And for the I.R.S., long been critized by the General Accounting Office and others for failing to produce a detailed modernization program, it surely is.
Yet in some respects the I.R.S. is proposing to do by the end of the century what credit-card companies, retail stores and banks now do routinely.
There are various reasons that this has taken so long, including the now-admitted error of allowing rapid technological improvement to paralyze planners seeking grand solutions. The I.R.S. also cites a backwash concern for privacy arising from the Watergate scandal, an issue to which it remains sensitive.
The agency says privacy and confidentiality will actually be enhanced under the modernization plan, which calls for data, encrypted into unreadable code, moving over telecommunications systems -- rather than in shipments of computer tape and paper files.
There is, however, at least one area where for taxpayers the bad may outweigh the good: quicker audits. But even here the agency finds a bright side. "You don't like being called on your 1988 tax return just after you filed your 1990 return," said Larry Westfall, the modernization director.Family Lending
A decade ago, the Government began to insist that family members who lend each other money charge market-oriented rates of interest, the idea being that the newlywed who borrows, say, the down payment on a house from parents gets a taxable benefit. Some such loans were also sham transactions aimed at evading gift taxes.
Now the issue is loan guarantees, routinely used by many parents to help finance children's tuitions, businesses, cars and houses. The I.R.S., in a quasi-authoritative letter ruling that has stunned specialists, says such guarantees are taxable gifts.
The service does not detail how it would calculate the value of a guarantee-gift, suggesting only that it might be related to the interest savings.
Even more troublesome, says Carlyn S. McCaffrey, a tax partner at the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, is that a loan guarantee can wreck estate planning. A Q-TIP, or qualified terminable interest, trust that contains a loan guarantee by a deceased parent is not eligible for the marital deduction that allows husbands and wives to transfer some assets tax-free.
 
 Footnotes
 State tax collectors are paying a personal price for slumping revenues. Only about 400 members of the Federation of Tax Administrators have registered for its annual convention in Indianapolis next week, about 25 percent fewer than the 1989-90 average. "The financial condition of the states is cutting into our attendance," said Harley T. Duncan, the group's executive vice president.
In a defeat for the I.R.S., the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has upheld the Tax Court's decision broadening the circumstances for deducting expenses for home offices.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines as Traders Cash In on Recent Advance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly lower on world currency markets yesterday as traders cashed in on the currency's recent run-up.
Traders spent the session selling dollars, but analysts said the action should be seen more as profit taking rather than a reaction to the latest economic statistics from the United States. 
 The economic data provided additional evidence that the recession was lifting. The Government said industrial production rose a seasonally adjusted five-tenths of 1 percent in May, while the Consumer Price Index was up just three-tenths of 1 percent in the same month.
"The numbers were actually quite good," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the financial advisory firm IDEA.
"They usually would have supported the dollar because they indicate more economic activity," he said. But the dollar's behavior had "nothing to do with fundamentals."
Instead, traders were reluctant to push the dollar higher because they feared such a move would be met by intervention from central banks. "Traders aren't ready to challenge the central banks," Mr. Chandler said.
Still, the underlying sentiment toward the dollar remains bullish, said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. He attributed the selloff to "normal end-of-the-week profit taking."
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.68 yen to close at 141.07 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at 140.50 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 140.70 yen, down from 141.25 on Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.6395, from $1.6380 late Thursday. In New York, a pound cost $1.6325, down from $1.6345 on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.7940 German marks, down from 1.7985; 1.5395 Swiss francs, up from 1.5390; 6.0970 French francs, down from 6.1030; 1,337.25 Italian lire, down from 1,338.00, and 1.1432 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1434.

City College Awards 1,900 Degrees, Belatedly

 BODY:
The City College of New York awarded more than 1,900 bachelor's and graduate degrees yesterday at its 145th commencement exercises.
The commencement was held later than usual because of a student protest in April over tuition increases in which students took over buildings and obstructed classes. 
 In his valedictory address, Emmanuel Gautreau, an English major, spoke of the increases and their effects. "The fact that many of our colleagues may not be able to continue their education as a result of tuition hikes and reductions in financial assistance disturbs me deeply," he said. But he denounced "exercises in futility like the takeover of administration buildings on our campuses."
Four honorary degrees were awarded. Three of the recipients are City College alumni: Faith Ringgold, an artist and teacher, Herbert Robinson, a business lawyer, and Edwin Torres, a New York State Supreme Court justice. Also honored was Erich Bloch, the former director of the National Science Foundation.
 
California Institute of Technology

At the California Institute of Technology's 97th commencement in Pasadena yesterday, President Bush urged graduates to "push beyond today's horizons" toward a 21st century when knowledge will determine America's role as a world power.
"Ours is an age of microchips and MTV," the President told 186 graduating seniors and 314 graduates receiving master's or doctoral degrees. "Ours is an economy increasingly dependent not on our natural resources, or geographic location, but upon knowledge."
Hecklers interrupted Mr. Bush's address with shouts, whistles and calls for abortion rights and help for AIDS victims, and the police escorted 15 demonstrators from the ceremony.

HEADLINE: U.S. Output Climbed 0.5% Last Month

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
Factories in May increased production of autos, furniture, appliances and other consumer goods, the Government reported today.
Production at factories, mines and utilities increased a seasonally adjusted five-tenths of 1 percent in May, the strongest gain in 11 months. 
The report, by the Federal Reserve, follows previous statistics showing increases in employment and retail sales last month.
 
 A Bottoming-Out Is Seen
 "These are all starting to paint a picture of an economy that has bottomed out," said Martin Regalia, an economist at the National Council of Savings Institutions. "If we don't have a relapse, we can say the patient is coming out of intensive care."
Today's report also revised the April production figure to show a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent, instead of the gain of one-tenth originally reported. The April advance ended a six-month string of declines, the longest since the 1981-82 recession. But even with the latest gains, production is still 3.3 percent below a year ago.
"The industrial sector is making the turn at this point, but it's not an explosive turn," said Stephen S. Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley & Company.
Much of the overall increase was accounted for by a 3.9 percent burst of output by utilities, with the electricity part of that component surging by 4.7 percent. Warmer-than-usual May weather in the East led to early use of air-conditioners.
Manufacturing was up two-tenths of 1 percent in May after a five-tenths of 1 percent rise in April. Mining output, which includes oil and gas wells, fell one-tenth of 1 percent.
The strength in manufacturing came in auto production, up 4.6 percent; appliances, television and air-conditioners, up 2 percent, and carpeting and furniture, up 1.1 percent.

HEADLINE: Tax Repeal Bill Introduced

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 14

 BODY:
Democratic lawmakers said today that they want to repeal the controversial sales tax on disposable paper products, which last year turned toilet paper into a symbol of New Jersey's anti-tax movement.
Senate Democrats quietly introduced a bill yesterday to remove the sales tax on paper products, which was part of the $2.8 billion in tax increases that drew voter wrath in 1990. 
 The bill's sponsor is Senator Laurence Weiss, Democrat of Middlesex, who heads the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senator said he would like the tax to be repealed before lawmakers adopt a new state budget by the end of the month.
A bill to repeal the tax has sat dormant in the Assembly since September.
"This tax has been offensive to a lot of people," said Mr. Weiss, who acknowledged that he does not want Republicans to use the tax as a campaign issue in the legislative elections this fall. "It's been a symbol, even though it came out to only about 3 1/2 cents a roll for toilet paper," he said.
Senator Weiss said today that the sales tax on paper products raises between $20 million and $30 million for the state annually. He acknowledged that repealing the tax "is going to make it a heck of a lot more difficult" to balance the state budget, especially given the current economic climate.
The Assembly minority leader, Chuck Haytaian, Republican of Warren, said he believed politics and voter anger had "forced the Democrats to see the light."
Nancy Kearney, a spokeswoman for Gov. Jim Florio, said the Governor would support any repeal as long as alternative funding is found.

HEADLINE: Long-Term Interest Rates Decline

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
A late burst of buying yesterday lifted prices of Treasury bonds to their best levels of the day in what dealers described as unusually active Friday trading. As a result long-term interest rates fell, contributing to the late rally in the stock market.
The market in long-term debt issues opened strongly following the release of Government reports showing a modest rise of three-tenths of 1 percent in the Consumer Price Index for May, and a five-tenths increase in industrial production last month. 
 While the rise in industrial output would normally be bearish for the fixed-income market, the gain was discounted because May's record hot weather stimulated sales and production of summer-related items, as well as the decline of five-tenths of 1 percent in inventories that the Government also reported.
 
 Yield Down to 8.45 Percent

The economic data caused the price of the benchmark Treasury long bonds, the 8 1/8 percent issue maturing in May 2021, to rise by about 18/32. Subsequent selling and pre-weekend book squaring shaved the gain by 4/32 before the midafternoon rally began. Late in the day, the long bonds were being offered at 96 14/32, up by 20/32, causing the yield to drop to 8.45 percent, from 8.50 percent the day before and 8.47 percent a week ago.
"The bond market interpreted the day's flow of economic reports as being neutral to slightly positive, which is why the early price rise and subsequent profit taking were relatively moderate affairs," said Allan R. Leslie, chief economist at the Discount Corporation of New York.
But as market participants prepared to leave for the weekend, Mr. Leslie added, many of those who had sold Treasury bonds short the day before as insurance in case Friday's economic reports were negative decided to buy out of their positions.
 
Strong Close in Futures
 Also contributing to the late surge in prices was the strong close of the Chicago Treasury bond futures market at 3 P.M., Eastern time. The spot June bond contract, which will expire on Tuesday, closed up 16/32 at 93 26/ 32.
There was also some speculation that some German portfolio managers had placed substantial buy orders for Treasury debt issues after their markets closed. German financial markets will be closed Monday for a holiday.
Among other representative Treasury issues traded in the secondary market, the 6 3/4 percent notes of 1993 rose 4/32, to 99 20/32, for a yield of 6.95 percent, and the 7 5/8 percent notes of 1996 jumped 9/32, to 98 27/32, to yield 7.91 percent. On Wednesday the Treasury is scheduled to announce the sizes of its monthly auctions of two- and five-year notes, which would take place the following week.
The Treasury's long notes, the 8 percent issue maturing in May 2001, soared 13/32, to 98 8/32, for a yield of 8.26 percent, the same as a week ago. The yield on the long notes is often compared with those on the 10-year Japanese and German "long bonds." The yield on the Japanese bonds is 6.88 percent; that on the comparable German issue is 8.33 percent.
At the shorter end of the Treasury market, the discount rate on the 90-day bills was unchanged at 5.59 percent; six-month bills declined three basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.78 percent, and the one-year bills slipped four basis points, to 5.97 percent.
 
Reserves Drained by Fed

The Federal Reserve intervened in the money market to drain reserves from the banking system. The move came as the Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans was at 5 5/8 percent, below the Fed's perceived target of 5 3/4 percent for this key interest rate.
In the Government agency sector, the Resolution Trust Corporation, charged with bailing out failed savings institutions, priced a three-part $480 million mortgage pass-through offering through a special purpose vehicle termed the Resolution Trust Corporation 1991-1. The securities are backed by adjustable-rate mortgages from the Columbia Savings and Loan Association, Beverly Hills, Calif., one of the agency's conservatorship institutions. The interest rates were set at 175 basis points over various Treasury maturities.

HEADLINE: Democrats Meet To Plot Strategy For '92 Election

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIDDLEBURG, Va., June 14

 BODY:
Several of the Democratic Party's most likely Presidential hopefuls retreated to an estate in the exclusive hunt country here today to begin plotting how they might wrest the White House from the Republicans in 1992.
Although the overnight meeting included 21 of the party's most reliable contributors, and although some promises were made, Democratic party officials said afterward that it was less a fund-raising event than a strategy meeting intended to give Democrats an "early start." 
 "It is clear to us that President Bush is very vulnerable in 1992, because this Administration has absolutely no domestic agenda," said the Democratic National Committee's chairman, Ronald H. Brown.
 
One Declared, Several Maybes
 The meeting, held at the home of Pamela Harriman, a Democratic fund-raiser and activist, about an hour west of Washington, drew the party's one declared candidate, Paul E. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator, and a number of possible candidates for 1992 or 1996: Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas; Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey; Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas; Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the Speaker of the House; Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader; Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa; Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska; George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, and Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, all of whom are considered possible candidates, were invited to today's meeting but said they could not attend.
Mr. Brown and others emerged from the meeting to say that they had arrived at a "preliminary strategy" and that they had agreed that Democrats should put aside intraparty rivalries and focus on organizing for the general election rather than for the primaries. They declined to give details of their new post-primary strategy.
The party's last Presidential nominee, Michael S. Dukakis, the former Massachusetts Governor, suffered in 1988, several of those present said, because there was no organized effort in place to carry his candidacy out of the Atlanta convention.
"There was not in place a coordinated campaign strategy post-convention," said Steve Grossman, who was co-chairman of Mr. Dukakis's finance committee and is the co-chairman of the new fund-raising effort, called the Democrats' Victory Campaign '92. "You can't decide on a national strategy when the Republicans were planning Willie Horton, the Pledge of Allegiance and Boston Harbor 12 to 18 months before."
Party leaders have said they hope to at least match their 1988 fund raising but they would not disclose any goal that has been set. The Democrats raised about $50 million for the 1988 general election campaign, in addition to the $46.1 million provided by the Federal Government.
 
Looking at Opinion Polls
 The Democrats have also taken heart from recent public and private polls that show a significant disparity between the numbers of Americans who say they approve of President Bush's overall performance, especially on foreign policy, and those who say they are content with the nation's domestic health.
In a New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted last week, 75 percent of those surveyed said they approved of the way Mr. Bush was handling his job. But 57 percent said they thought the economy was fairly bad or very bad.
Mr. Clinton said party leaders hoped to seize on these perceived weaknesses in Mr. Bush's armor of popularity to regain the White House. He said they must capitalize on working people's concerns about health care, the economy and education.
"They're worried that their schools aren't very good and when they get out of them they won't be able to afford to send them to college," Mr. Clinton said.

HEADLINE: S.I. Toddler Dies And Her Mother Faces Charges

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
A 32-year-old Staten Island woman was arrested yesterday after her severely bruised daughter was found dead in her apartment, the police said.
When paramedics arrived at the apartment early yesterday morning, in response to a call from the mother, Selena Walker, they discovered the child, Chardasia, 16 months old, lying on a couch, without a pulse. The girl had a fractured skull, a broken left ankle, burns on the left hand and right foot and multiple bruises on the head, the police said. 
 She was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital on Staten Island, where she was pronounced dead shortly after 8 A.M.
Ms. Walker, who is unemployed, was charged yesterday afternoon with endangering the welfare of a child, the police said. Her four other children, all younger than 8 years of age, were placed in a foster home. Investigators said they would seek murder charges if a medical examiner rules the toddler's death a homicide.
"The hospital couldn't give us anything definite on the cause of death," said Lieut. William Quinn of the Staten Island Detectives. "So we don't want to jump and assume this is a homicide."
 
Mother's Call
 An autopsy had not been performed on the toddler last night, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the Medical Examiner.
At 7:43 A.M., Ms. Walker called the police and told them her toddler was not breathing, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Peter Berry. The 911 operator put the call through to an operator for the Emergency Medical Service, who gave Ms. Walker instructions for giving the child mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, said a spokeswoman for the service, Lynn Shulman.
An ambulance arrived at 7:53 and paramedics immediately took the toddler to the hospital, while the police took Ms. Walker to the 122d Precinct station house. She requested a lawyer and made no statements about the child's death.
Because Ms. Walker will not say what happened to her child, the police were unsure last night whether the child's injuries came from a beating or from some other mishap, Lieutentant Quinn said. "She was surprised when we told her about the injuries," he said.
The four other children living in the apartment -- three boys and a girl -- were also taken to St. Vincent's and given examinations, but doctors found them to be in good condition, the police said. Ms. Walker also has a 16-year-old daughter who lives with her grandmother in the Bronx.
Citing state confidentiality laws, a spokesman for the Human Resources Administration, Earl Weber, refused to comment on whether Ms. Walker had been the subject of child-abuse investigations in the past.

HEADLINE: St. Petersburg Journal;
No Hits, No Runs, One Error: The Dome

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. PETERS BURG, Fla., June 14

 BODY:
Like a base stealer who risked the game and got caught in a rundown between third and home, this city on Florida's Gulf Coast was picking itself up and dusting itself off this week.
It risked $139 million to build a domed baseball stadium, although it had no major league team to occupy it and pay to maintain it. 
 It still doesn't.
Last weekend a National League committee bypassed St. Petersburg and its shiny new stadium, which opened early this year, and recommended Miama and Denver for two new franchises. A final vote by all major league owners is expected to ratify the choices.
In Florida the quest for the legendary Fountain of Youth has often merged with the state's quest for development or renewal. For many people, the construction of the domed stadium on speculation is a new version of the same wild-eyed vision.
The stadium, the Florida Suncoast Dome, now joins a $200 million downtown retail development project as symbols of the city's frustrated efforts to reinvigorate itself. The development project was intended to attract fashionable stores to Mediterranean-style buildings downtown.
But retail space sits unused, a victim of the recession. And now the dome seems doomed to house little more than the occasional concert, tractor pull and trade show.
To be sure, the failure to get a team is not likely to bankrupt St. Petersburg, but it does mean that taxpayers will have to pay much of the $1.7 million annual operating cost and most of the estimated $8 million annual debt service for a stadium that was not only supposed to pay for itself, but was also expected to make a profit.
"If it is not seriously fought, a psychological depression could set in along with the economic depression which has hurt our efforts," said David Carr, a former member of the City Planning Board, who supported the stadium project.
On Thursday, Mayor David J. Fischer helped pull together a larger group of local business leaders to form a stronger local ownership group in an effort to "steal" a team from another city.
For Dennis McDonald, a local businessman and unsuccessful mayoral candidate who has long opposed the dome, the baseball committee's decision was an unwelcome vindication of what he had been saying all along. The dome was a speculative project, he said, and voters in this city of 240,000 people should have been given an opportunity to decide whether they wanted to change the city's image in this way and at this cost.
Raymond O. Arsenault, a history professor at the University of South Florida here, who wrote "St. Petersburg and the Florida Dream, 1888-1950," said building the stadium and the city's unsuccessful quest for a major league team were consistent with the city's history.
In the 1930's St. Petersburg's claims of perpetually sunny days and leisure activities were relentlessly hawked to Depression-racked Northerners seeking a retirement haven and tourist attractions like James Earl "Doc" Webb's pharmacy, billed as "the world's most unusual drug store," which mixed commerce with entertainment that included talking mermaids and dancing chickens.
But St. Petersburg constantly lost out in its perennial competition with its cross-bay neighbor, Tampa. That city, with its cigar factories and commercial shipping, became the industrial giant of the area.
As a retirement haven St. Petersburg was once the butt of jokes, with its ubiquitous green benches and blood pressure machines for the elderly. But in the last 20 years, said former Mayor Robert Ulrich, the average age of the city's residents has dropped from 58 to 42, and the city has been trying hard to change its image as "heaven's waiting room."
While even opponents of the domed stadium say the city has few options now but to continue to pursue a team, they hope there will be some re-examination of how the city arrived at this point.
"I think we were blinded by the goal of becoming a major league city and changing our image from that of a sleepy retirement community," said Darryl Poulson, a political scientist at the University of South Florida who has opposed the stadium.

HEADLINE: Consumer Index Up Only 0.3%; Output Higher

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
In another batch of favorable data, the Government reported yesterday that the economy appeared to be growing again without pushing up the inflation rate. Most economists consider that combination essential if the nation is to shake off the recession.
The Consumer Price Index rose in May by only three-tenths of 1 percent, the Labor Department said. When combined with other modest increases this year, the May rise suggests an annual inflation rate below 3 percent, or less than half of last year's 6.1 percent. 
 "From a policy maker's point of view, the inflation numbers are good, and they look to continue good for the foreseeable future," said Patrick Jackman, chief of the group of economists who gather inflation data at the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 
 Effect on Interest Rates
 His reference was to the Federal Reserve's 5 sitting governors and 12 regional bank presidents, a policy-making group that tends to raise interest rates and discourage economic activity -- provoking or prolonging a recession -- whenever inflation appears to be rising. The Federal Reserve had lowered rates through April, to stimulate the economy, but has not acted since.
The favorable economic news helped push up stock prices yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 35.33, to 3,000.45. [Page 35.]
The Government also reported yesterday that industrial production rose in May for the second consecutive month, by a hefty five-tenths of 1 percent, and business inventories declined in April, as retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers sold more than they bought.
Declining inventories suggest that industrial production will keep rising as companies replenish their stockpiles. This happened in May. Rising auto production was a big reason for the production increase, but economists said that if auto sales fell back from the annual rate of more than 6 million vehicles reached in early June, production might taper off as well, threatening the recovery.
The May consumer price data showed mild price increases in almost every sector. Only gasoline prices were up noticeably, along with medical costs and apparel prices. Inflation in the service sector, a problem until late winter, rose in May by less than half the rate that prevailed for several months until February. Similarly, shelter costs -- that is, rent, the monthly cost of home ownership, and hotel rates -- rose by only a fraction of previous increases.
 
 Another Mild Reading
 The "core rate" of inflation -- the price index minus food and energy costs, which can fluctuate sharply -- rose at a similarly mild two-tenths of 1 percent, roughly the level of the last three months.
"With oil prices under control and wage costs knocked down by the high unemployment rate, we will see mild inflation for the rest of the year," said Roger E. Brinner, president of DRI/ McGraw Hill, an economic consulting service. Unemployment is 6.9 percent.
On the face of it, the consumer price report seemed to contradict Thursday's inflation news. The Labor Department had reported that producer prices for finished goods -- the prices that factories charge wholesalers, retailers and distributors for goods coming off the assembly line -- had risen a sharp six-tenths of 1 percent in May. But that was mostly from big increases in gasoline, tobacco and aircraft prices, economists noted. What is more, the prices of intermediate and crude goods, the prices manufacturers pay for steel, raw cotton and the like, were either flat or fell in May, for the fourth straight month.
 
 Talk of Recession's End
 Viewing yesterday's data, which came on top of Thursday's report of rising retail sales, most economists agreed with Peter L. Bernstein, a New York economics consultant, who said, "The signals are coming from too many different places not to conclude that the recession is coming to an end."
But there were caveats, including one from Vice President Dan Quayle. "The question is: How vigorous a recovery are we going to have?" he said yesterday, adding, "and there is now a question being raised about the monetary supply" and whether it will grow sufficiently to underwrite a recovery.
The nation's money supply -- essentially, the total amount of money held by people in currency and in various forms of savings -- has been growing weakly for more than two months. Changes in money supply are a gauge of the level of borrowing to finance economic activity, with a shrinking money supply indicating weak borrowing.
Raising another concern, Mr. Brinner said that until there was a clear pattern of job creation, Americans would not have enough income to sustain greater consumption. Mostly because of layoffs, jobs disappeared each month from July through April, with the employment rolls finally starting to grow in May.
For Robert Hall, a Stanford University economist, the issue is whether the upturn will become strong enough that the recession can be declared over. Mr. Hall is chairman of a committee of seven economists who fix for the nation the dates when recessions start and end. In April, the committee set last July as the recession's starting date.
The committee's next debate, Mr. Hall said, might be similar to the one that absorbed it in late 1980. A recession that started in January of that year appeared to have ended by August, but the committee was not sure the recovery had been strong enough to qualify as a change of direction in the economy, Mr. Hall said.
 
 Reaching a Decision
 In early 1981, the committee finally declared that the recovery had indeed been strong enough and that the recession had ended the previous July. A new recession began a year later, in July 1981, and was recognized by the committee early in 1982.
"Our general philosophy is to ask: Has the economy gotten back to the previous peak?" Mr. Hall said, referring in this case to the level of the nation's economic activity that existed last July. By that standard, industrial production and some other activities are still well below par, he noted. If the current upturn brings them back to July's levels, then the committee would presumably say, in hindsight, that the recovery began this spring.
For the time being, consumer prices are cooperating with this goal. Sharp increases in energy and food prices had artificially pushed up inflation in January and February and a sharp decline in energy prices made inflation seem unusually low in March and April, Mr. Jackman said. But the May rise seems to reflect the underlying trend, he said.

HEADLINE: New Tools for States Bolster Collection of Child Support

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
Aided by new laws and an infusion of Federal money, state child-support enforcement agencies around the country have become far more aggressive at collecting child support.
Since the enactment of the Family Support Act of 1988, states have become more aggressively involved in collecting court-ordered child support awards, taking in a record $6 billion in 1990. And, according to one recent survey, the average amount of court-ordered child support has increased about 50 percent, to $60 a week. New mechanisms are in place for garnisheeing the wages of parents who owe child-support payments, and most states have started issuing their own "Most Wanted" lists, or staging roundups to arrest parents who fail to pay. Such tactics generate a wave of payments not only from the people singled out but also from others who wish to avoid negative publicity. 
 All states must now report delinquent parents' debts to credit agencies. A few states are experimenting with reporting child-support debts to the state licensing boards that regulate doctors, lawyers, plumbers, hairdressers and others.
But there is still a long way to go before children whose parents divorced, or never married, can be assured of receiving support from their noncustodial parent -- the father, in 9 out of 10 cases.
 
Delinquent Almost Captured
 The odyssey of Gregory Morey Sr. is a case in point.
Mr. Morey was ordered to pay $600 a month to support his three small children when he and his wife divorced 10 years ago. But he never paid a penny, Arizona child-support officials say, and he has repeatedly foiled their efforts to find him and recover what has become a $74,000 debt.
"He's a perfect illustration of the problems we face," said Ray Weaver, director of Arizona's child-support enforcement office. "He's changed his Social Security number four times, he's changed the spelling of his name, and he's worked in six different Western states."
Last month, after a national organization of child-support officials put out a "Most Wanted" poster of the worst child-support offenders from 22 states, Mr. Weaver almost caught Mr. Morey.
"We opened our doors at 8 A.M. on the day that USA Today ran a story on the national 'Most Wanted' list, and by 8:30 we knew where he was," said Mr. Weaver. "He was working as a restaurant manager in Utah, and we got a call from his employer. We tried to move quickly, but by the time we got legal process up there, he was gone. We do have some new leads to follow, though."
As of the end of 1989, more than $18 billion in accumulated support, covering more than 16 million children, was still unpaid.
The Census Bureau estimated that in 1987, the last year for which it has analyzed the data, almost a third of all court-awarded child support, or $4.6 billion, went unpaid, and experts say the soon-to-be-released 1989 estimate will show little change.
Child support is an issue for millions of families: one in four American children under the age of 18 now lives in a single-parent family. And with one in five American children living in poverty, politicians and social policy experts alike have become increasingly concerned with trying to assure that both parents assume financial responsibility for their children.
 
Crucial for Dependents
 "Child-support payments can be the difference between dependence on welfare and economic independence," said David Siegel, a spokesman for the Administration for Children and Families, the Federal agency that oversees child-support enforcement in public assistance cases and those where the custodial parent has requested help in collecting an award. "Our goal is to support parental responsibility and make sure that children get the support they're legally entitled to."
In the Morey case, as in many others, the father's failure to pay child support pushed the family into poverty, and, for a while, onto welfare. Mr. Morey's former wife, Susan Aldrich, said she and the three children -- Heather, 16, Greg Jr., 14, and Adrieanne, 12 -- had never received a penny of the $600-a-month child support Mr. Morey was ordered to pay when the couple divorced in 1981.
"We were evicted and the utilities were cut off, and I was so down on my luck that I was afraid I would have to give the children up for them to eat and have a home," said Mrs. Aldrich.
She remarried six years ago. "Now my husband supports us all, and his own son," she said, "but he's a technical instructor, which is not a high-paying job, and even with him working two shifts, the budget's tight. I've located Greg eight or nine times in the last 10 years, but each time he's been made aware that he's been located, he picks up and moves."
 
Major Enforcement Hurdle
 Collecting child support from delinquents who have crossed state lines is now one of the biggest problems in the system, according to enforcement officials and children's advocates.
Margaret Campbell Haynes, chairwoman of the United States Commission on Interstate Child Support, estimates that as many as 30 percent of all cases may involve an out-of-state parent, although less than 10 percent of all money collected comes from out of state. The commission, created by the Family Support Act, plans to offer recommendations early next year on improving the system.
Meanwhile, Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, and Senator Richard C. Shelby, Democrat of Alabama, have introduced legislation that would make it a Federal crime to flee to another state to avoid child-support obligations.
Over the last six years, Congress has pushed the states to improve child-support enforcement, largely in an effort to reduce welfare payments to poor children who are not receiving support from their parents.
Federal laws now allow child-support enforcement officials -- who are welfare officials in most states, but part of the attorney general's office or the tax department in others -- to intercept tax refund checks and garnishee the wages of parents who owe child support.
 
Problem With Garnishment
 But these tactics have not been entirely successful: garnishment, for example, tends to break down as soon as the parent leaves one job and takes another with an employer who is unaware of the child-support obligations. Tracing the parent becomes particularly difficult if, as in the case of Mr. Morey and millions of others, he switches jobs frequently and crosses state lines.
In 1989 the noncustodial parent's wages were being garnisheed in only one in five cases in which this should have been done under the law. And while more recent statistics are not available, child-support officials and advocates say they doubt that the proportion has increased much since then.
"If the father changes jobs three or four times a year, which lots of them do, there's no way to find them immediately," said Harry Wiggins, a Virginia enforcement official who is president of the National Council of State Child Support Enforcement Adminstrators.
Mr. Wiggins and others maintain that the child-support system will never work properly without a national data base, and some kind of universal screening for new employees, to see whether they have child-support obligations. But such a system is generally acknowledged to be a long way off.
In many states the caseloads are so large, and staffs so small, that when a family reports not receiving court-ordered child support, it can be as much as a year before any action is taken.
 
Need to Establish Paternity
 Many cases never get as far as an order for child support: more than a quarter of all children in the United states are born out of wedlock, and for such children, child-support officials must formally establish paternity before support can be collected.
The Family Support Act requires that states try to obtain Social Security numbers from both parents at the time of each birth, and there is now Federal financing to help the states in identifying or tracking down fathers, and giving blood tests if necessary. But most states have failed, because of the slowness of bureaucracy, to establish paternity in about two-thirds of their out-of-wedlock cases.
The Family Support Act of 1988 also requires each state to adopt specific guidelines for setting child-support awards, so that judges faced with the same situation would order the same payment.
The guidelines differ substantially from state to state, with some states requiring that the noncustodial parent pay a flat percentage of earnings, while others looking at both parents' earnings and requiring each to pay a proportionate share of the children's expenses.
 
Guidelines for Awards
 Under the law, the guidelines are to be used to compute the award unless a parent in a particular case can show that because of the family's special circumstances, the guidelines would produce some unusual hardship or unfairness.
A survey of 375 members of the Association for Children for Enforcement of Support, a nationwide advocacy group, found that the average support order had gone from $40 a week before the guidelines to $60 a week after. In Virginia, Mr. Wiggins said, the average order has doubled in the 18 months since the guidelines went into effect, to $270 a month.
But Geraldine Jensen, president of the association, said many judges were still ignoring the guidelines and setting unrealistically low awards.
"The guidelines have helped a little bit," Ms. Jensen said, "but what I would really like to see would be national guidelines, so that the award you get doesn't depend on whether you're in Ohio or Alabama."

Since the enactment of the Family Support Act of 1988, states have become more involved in collecting court-ordered child support awards. Mr. Morey Sr. is among the "Most Wanted" offenders in Arizona. (Tim Koors for The New York Times)(pg. 9)

HEADLINE: Citizenship For 6,000 In Ceremony In Queens

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH

 BODY:
In the largest naturalization ceremony in New York City since 1954, more than 6,000 people from 100 different countries crammed a Queens auditorium yesterday and pledged allegiance to the United States.
The pipes and drums of the New York City Police Department Emerald Society band brought roars of approval from the crowd. And when the keynote singer did not arrive to sing the national anthem, half a dozen immigration lawyers improvised a chorus and asked the 6,050 new American citizens to sing along. 
 The hourlong swearing-in ceremony was the largest since 1954 when 9,000 new Americans were sworn in at the Polo Grounds in upper Manhattan. The crowd yesterday was a result of immigration housekeeping. In one fell swoop, the Immigration and Naturalization Service cleaned up a backlog caused by the increasing numbers of qualified applicants in the Eastern District of New York, which encompasses Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Nassau and Suffolk Counties, immigration officials said.
 
Auditorium at St. John's
 "We figured 9,000 would wipe out our backlog but we couldn't find a place to do 9,000," said Charles Troy, a spokesman for the I.N.S. Officials did not want to risk inclement weather by having the ceremony outside. The largest auditorium they could find held 6,000 people and was at St. John's University in Hillcrest, Queens.
Such ceremonies are not uncommon in other parts of the country. Joe Flanders, an information officer for the I.N.S. in Southern California, said, "We average ceremonies with 7,000 to 8,000 people, two or three times a year."
Most of the immigrants yesterday were from Brooklyn and Queens, two boroughs that have come to embody a changing New York City, reshaped in the last decade by a large immigrant influx. The New York City branch of the I.N.S. interviews an estimated 60,000 immigrants a year, Mr. Troy said. Most become citizens.
Immigration requires all citizens to hold resident green cards for at least five years before becoming American citizens. Yesterday's crowd was a mixture of races and religions and reasons for becoming citizens. Becoming an American made it easier to get a job and travel and made it possible to vote, they said. They all planned to celebrate: dinners with family, a barbecue bash in upstate New York, a date with a new boyfriend.
 
Flags Are Distributed
 "Most probably came here through other family members," Mr. Troy said. "They may have come for economic reasons. When they become citizens it's easier under immigration laws to turn around and petition for other immediate relatives."
As the thousands poured into the auditorium dressed as if they were going to a fancy reception, they were all given miniature American flags. The largest representation was 547 people from Guyana. The next largest groups were from China, Barbados, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic.
Dressed in a brown suit, holding an American flag, Iftikar Aziz Nazmi, 27, had trouble letting his not-yet so nimble English express his emotions. Mr. Nazmi, a printing product manager in Brooklyn, left Bangladesh six years ago and is the first of his family -- seven siblings and his parents -- to get citizenship. His father had worked in the United States embassy in Dacca for 38 years before coming to this country, he said.
"Today, I am finally free," he said. "Sometimes I miss Bangladesh. But today I am an American. I am a passport holder."
Yesterday evening, the entire family planned to go out to dinner.
Won Ju Kim believes his greatest privilege will be to vote. A native of Seoul, South Korea, Mr. Kim, 31, arrived as a student eight years ago. Since then he has moved from Illinois to Brooklyn where he works in a Korean importing business. Aside from economic incentives, his reasoning for becoming an American is simple and straightforward. "I can now do what I believe," he said. "My life is more wide open."
Victoria Eugenia Nieto left Barranquilla, Colombia, when she was 25. She did not speak English, had few friends and no job. She did not even know how to drive a car. Now, six years later, she works at Macy's at Roosevelt Field on Long Island as a sales associate.
Miss Nieto said she brought her values from Colombia and that she will never forget where she came from. First thing yesterday morning, she called her father in Colombia to tell him the news. "Tonight," she said, opening her eyes wide and laughing, "I have a date! We're going out for sushi."

HEADLINE: Profits Drop at Maxwell

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, June 14

 BODY:
Maxwell Communication Corporation P.L.C. said today that its profit fell 9.2 percent in its latest fiscal year.
Robert Maxwell, chairman, who owns The Daily News in New York separately, said the company's core publishing and information services interests continued to do well, particularly in North America, despite the difficult economic climate. 
 The company said its net profit for the year ended March 31 fell to 125.1 million, or $218 million, from 137.8 million in the corresponding period a year ago.
Maxwell Communication said its pretax profit fell 16 percent, to 145.5 million, or $253 million, from 172.3 million a year earlier.
Sales fell 20 percent, to 996.9 million, or $1.73 billion, from 1.242 billion a year earlier.
In April, after the close of the financial year, Maxwell sold its Pergamon Press business to the Dutch publisher Elsevier N.V. for $766 million. Most of the proceeds will be used to reduce Maxwell Communication's debt and "represents substantial progress," the company said.

 The economy appears to be growing again without pushing up the inflation rate. The Consumer Price Index rose in May by only three-tenths of 1 percent, the Labor Department said. When combined with other modest increases this year, the rise suggests an annual inflation rate below 3 percent, or less than half of last year's 6.1 percent. [1.]
 Production at factories, mines and utilities increased a seasonally adjusted five-tenths of 1 percent in May, the strongest gain in 11 months. [46.] Business sales rose 1.2 percent in April while inventories fell five-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $815.2 billion, the lowest level since June 1990. [46.]
 Washington must give back more than $20 million of duties collected on imports of Canadian pork, the highest appeals tribunal under the United States-Canadian trade agreement decided. [35.]

HEADLINE: U.N. AIDES SAY IRAQ MAY BE CONCEALING NUCLEAR MATERIAL

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 14

 BODY:
United Nations officials said today that they had intelligence information indicating that Iraq has tried to mislead the United Nations by understating its nuclear weapons program and the amount of weapons-grade nuclear material it possesses.
As a result, the special commission appointed by the Security Council to oversee the destruction or removal of Iraq's chemical and biological arms and its nuclear weapons materials has ordered its experts to make new inspections of undisclosed nuclear sites in Iraq next week. 
 The inspections were ordered after the United States provided the commission with fresh intelligence from an Iraqi nuclear scientist who defected more than a week ago to American forces occupying an enclave in northern Iraq.
 
Information From Defector
 In Washington, Government officials who follow the Iraqi nuclear program said the defector had reported that Iraq had eight primary sites for nuclear research and development, three of which were bombed extensively by the American-led military coalition in the Persian Gulf war.
Most of the defector's reports remain unproven and will require additional investigation, the officials said.
United Nations officials said they had been told that the Iraqi defector reported that Iraq has been trying to manufacture weapons-grade uranium using an old-fashioned technique called magnetic isotope separation, which the United States experimented with but abandoned while it was developing the world's first atomic bomb toward the end of World War II.
 
Plant Near Mosul Reported
 A plant for this purpose was said to exist in a secret underground site in the mountains not far from the northern Iraqi city of Mosul.
The defector also said there were several other secret nuclear sites unknown to outsiders, officials here said.
A United States official, citing intelligence reports, said Iraq's nuclear weapons program had nevertheless been judged by analysts to have been more primitive than many feared.
Some of the eight sites may have been spared extensive bombing because they were not regarded as critical to the nation's nuclear-weapons effort, an official said today. Still, he said, "it's a very major concern that we didn't find all the sites" for nuclear and chemical weapons research.
Iraq also removed an undetermined amount of equipment from its nuclear-weapons centers before the allied air campaign began, officials said today, but they added that that action was not unexpected.
Under the terms of Security Council Resolution 687 that set conditions for lifting economic sanctions against Iraq, the Baghdad Government is required to provide inventories of all material in its possession that could be used for nuclear weapons as well as chemical and biological arms and ballistic missiles to the special commission, which will then remove or destroy them.
Iraq told the Security Council in April that it possessed only the 45 kilos, or nearly 100 pounds, of highly enriched uranium that it had declared to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
In Washington, Paul L. Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, which studies nuclear proliferation issues, said Administration officials had told him that the defector said Iraq had manufactured an additional 40 kilos -- about 88 pounds -- of weapons-grade material using magnetic isotope separation.
In a statement, the Nuclear Control Institute said J. Carson Mark, retired director of weapons design at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, has estimated that this amount would be sufficient for two atomic bombs of the kind dropped on Nagasaki in 1945.
 
'Ominous Failures' Seen
 If confirmed, the Nuclear Control Institute said, the defector's reports would highlight "ominous failures," both in American intelligence gathering and in the international efforts to control the spread of atomic weapons.
Iraq has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, pledging not to acquire nuclear arms and opening its declared nuclear sites to inspection by the Vienna-based Atomic Energy Agency.
In May, inspectors sent by the commission placed some of the 45 declared kilos of enriched uranium under tamper-proof seals at Iraq's Tuwaitha nuclear site but said the rest was buried under the rubble of a plant bombed by the allies during the war.
At the same time, the inspectors visited a nuclear site at Tarmiya, north of Baghdad. Although they found nothing incriminating, officials say, the inspectors had the impression that the plant had recently been stripped of its equipment in a hurry.
Members of the special commission have also expressed doubts about the accuracy of Baghdad's inventories of its chemical and biological weapons and its stocks of ballistic missiles.
 
More Than What Was Declared
 United Nations officials said that under questioning from the commission, Baghdad recently admitted that it has substantially more chemical weapons than it declared on April 18.
At that time, it told the commission that it had about 11,000 shells, bombs and rockets filled with paralyzing nerve agents and poisonous gas as well as about 1,000 tons of chemicals used in the manufacture of such weapons.
Iraq also has acknowledged that it has more ballistic missiles than the 52 it reported on April 18.
The first chemical weapons inspectors are now in Iraq cataloguing stocks at the Muthana base near Samarra, some 50 miles north of Baghdad.
Later this month the commission will send experts to examine ballistic missiles and suspected biological weapons plants. Iraq says it has no biological weapons.
The exact size of Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction is important because the Security Council is seeking both to destroy those now in inventory and to prevent Baghdad from acquiring any more in the future.
Once the commission has completed its survey, it will determine the best way of destroying them. Commission officials say dangerous chemicals are likely to be burned locally in special incinerators.
The more difficult task is destroying chemical munitions. The commission, which has established a regional headquarters in Bahrain, is considering borrowing mobile destruction plants developed by the Soviet Union or building a special destruction plant.

HEADLINE: Allies and East Bloc Back Arms Accord

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
The United States' NATO allies and five Eastern European countries today formally approved a Soviet-American compromise to end a dispute over a treaty limiting conventional armies in Europe.
The Bush Administration will now send the treaty to the Senate for its approval. It is not expected to meet much opposition, considering that it will require the Soviets to withdraw thousands of pieces of military equipment from Europe to bring their forces down to levels roughly equal to those of NATO's and will require the Soviets to destroy some 20,000 tanks, artillery and armored vehicles. 
 Even without the treaty, the Soviets were withdrawing their forces from Eastern Europe. But the treaty will insure that they do it in a timely, verifiable fashion.
The treaty on conventional forces in europe was signed at a Paris summit meeting last Nov. 19. But its ratification by the 16 NATO and 6 Warsaw Pact countries covered by the agreement, among them the Soviet Union, had been held up because of a last-minute attempt by Moscow to reinterpret the pact in a way that would enable the Soviet military to spare some of its equipment.
 
Prompt Senate Action Expected
 "After months of concern that the Soviet military might be trying to undermine the treaty, President Gorbachev seems to have reasserted control," said Senator Joseph R. Biden, the Delaware Democrat who as chairman of the subcommittee on European Affairs will manage the ratification hearings and the floor debate. "With the interpretation dispute now resolved, I expect the Senate to act promptly to bring this historic accord into effect."
The Soviet backtracking since November was widely viewed as an attempt by the Soviet military to try to win back some of the concessions made by Soviet diplomats during the negotiations. But the Bush Administration refused to send the treaty to the Senate for ratification, or to consider another summit meeting, until the Soviets backed down.
Two weeks ago, during a meeting in Lisbon, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, hammered out a compromise in which the Soviets essentially agreed to the NATO interpretation of the treaty, but with some minor concessions by the West to bring the Soviet military along.
At today's meeting in Vienna, the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact, which has disbanded its military command but retains its political structure, delivered binding declarations accepting the Soviet pledges as the basis for a treaty ratification.
The main dispute was over 933 tanks and other armored pieces assigned to Soviet naval and coastal defense units. The Kremlin insisted that these units were not covered by the treaty because it technically covers ground forces and not navies. But NATO insisted that the Soviet Union's naval infantry -- equivalent to the United States Marines -- and coastal defense forces were essentially ground troops.
Under the compromise, NATO agreed that the Soviets could keep the equipment belonging to their naval and coastal defense forces, provided that Moscow promise not to increase their size and that it withdraw an equal amount of equipment from other units.
In an additional concession, Moscow agreed to destroy or convert to civilian use roughly a quarter of the 57,000 pieces of armored equipment that it had withdrawn from the treaty zone, which stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains, before the Nov. 19 signing.
In a concession to Moscow, NATO agreed to the Soviet demand to exclude 1,700 armored personnel carriers assigned to strategic nuclear rocket forces by treating them as internal security units, not ground forces.

BUSH STILL WARY ON AID TO MOSCOW
 LOS ANGELES, June 14 (Special to The New York Times) -- Restating his contention that it is too early to talk about massive economic aid to the Soviet Union, President Bush said today that there was "general agreement" on the issue among the leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized democracies, who are to meet in London in July.

HEADLINE: In Tight Times (Shh!) Haggling Can Be A Status Symbol

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
Bargaining. People are doing it everywhere. But it's not something they're talking about much.
If you catch someone at it and know the person well enough to ask why they're trying to get a pair of tennis shoes for $2 less than the tagged price, they'll have a host of ready excuses at hand. Mostly they add up to the fact that tennis shoes have got to be pretty expensive, that there is a recession and that most sellers will give a little to get a little. But lots of people won't admit they enjoy the give and take. 
 There are many countries where haggling has always been a way of life. In the United States, only certain categories of goods, like antiques, for example, were always thought to be fair game for bargaining. That, after all, is what a flea market is all about. But now people are trying for lower prices almost everywhere, including department stores and speciality food shops.
 
Paying the Price
 Still, bargaining is not for everyone. A good many Americans shudder at the prospect. "We have been conditioned in this country to think of haggling as not possible, or inappropriate," said Vivian Walker, a sociologist who was raised in Little Rock, Ark., where Southern graciousness seemed to outlaw bargaining.
Dr. Walker, who has researched cultural differences in negotiating methods, has found that a good many people simply retreat or go along and pay the asking price. "And that's a shame," she said, "because once you test the boundaries, you can be quite surprised."
So how do you get over any discomfort you might feel to get that new shirt you wanted for $20 less than the ticketed "bargain" price? The key, said Prof. Jeanne Brett, who teaches negotiating skills at the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., is to start by legitimizing the act in your own mind.
 
Timing Is Crucial
 She mentioned, for example, how she had been out shopping for a pair of shoes a few weeks ago. The pair she liked had a defective buckle. Although she knew she could still wear the shoes without the defect showing or making a difference to comfort, she also felt she was entitled to a markdown.
"It meant that I had to ask for something off," she said. "But the manager agreed right away."
Timing is also crucial. Dr. Brett recalled how her husband, Stephen, an arbitrator by profession and another consummate haggler, had been eager to buy a large can of walnut oil in a specialty food market in a Chicago suburb. "But the price just seemed too high," she said.
Two months later, when the can was still sitting on the shelf, he told the manager he was willing to buy it -- provided something was knocked off the price. The manager refused. But six weeks later, with the can still unsold, the manager agreed to a discount.
"It's like going to a farmer's market," Dr. Brett said. "You'll pay full price if you go in the morning. But wait until late in the day and most merchants will be delighted to give you a break."
Most consumers might not want to wait as long as Mr. Brett for walnut oil, but the longer a consumer is prepared to wait the more likely he is to get what he wants for less. Of course, it is always easier if you stop to figure out how you can benefit the vendor and then make that point in your argument, said Robert Prus, a professor of sociology at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ont.
Dr. Prus spent nine years studying consumer behavior for two books on sales and purchasing techniques. "Most people only think about what they will get out of it," he said. "But it pays to consider the vendor's viewpoint."
This is the approach favored by Neil Levy, a lawyer in San Francisco. Mr. Levy said he learned his haggling skills from his Uncle Ben who once took all his nephews and nieces to a basket market in the Caribbean as a sort of final examination in the genre.
As an example of capitalizing on the vendor's needs, Mr. Levy explained how he was recently approached at his home by a chimney sweep looking for business. The sweep, a respected man, quoted a price for cleaning and repair. Rather than accepting the quote, or seeking another sweep, Mr. Levy decided he wanted to court this man's service.
"He obviously needed the business or he wouldn't have come by," said Mr. Levy. "I also knew that if I let him do the job in his slow season he would gain something by reducing the price. So I told him he could choose his own time provided he reconsidered what he was charging."
Similarly, Mr. Levy said it helps to be aware that some storekeepers may be more interested in giving you something extra than reducing a price, "because they don't want other customers to demand a similiar break." This is often true in appliance stores, he said. "Ask them to throw in something with the purchase instead. And they often will, especially when they are slow."
 
Keep Asking
 Seymour Mund of Westport, Conn., who polished his haggling skills in the 1970's as a union negotiator, confirmed the value of this approach a few months ago when he was looking for a clip-on light for a music stand. The floor sample was the only one in stock. So he asked for a reduction because it had obviously been opened and handled. The manager refused. So Mr. Mund asked for an extra replacement bulb since the light required the use of a miniature, expensive size. The manager agreed.
Dr. Prus said it is crucial to make your pitch only to the person who has the authority to make a price change. It also makes a big difference if the store manager or vendor is approached unobtrusively -- "not when there are lots of other people around to see."
Knowing something in advance about prices for similar items or services elsewhere is also important. "Do your homework," Mr. Levy said. Check around to see what constitutes a really good -- but fair -- price. That will help to prevent you from insulting the vendor by heavy underbidding. That's the mistake that most often spells goodbye to the good buy.
