HEADLINE: Williams Partners to Buy Caiman Eastern Midstream for $2.5 Billion

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Williams Partners plans to buy Caiman Eastern Midstream, a subsidiary of Caiman Energy that focuses on processing shale gas and liquids, to expand its operations in the Marcellus Shale formation. 

 BODY:
Williams Partners agreed on Monday to buy Caiman Eastern Midstream, a subsidiary of Caiman Energy that focuses on processing shale gas and liquids in the Marcellus Shale, for $2.5 billion, in the latest deal in the oil and natural gas patch.
Williams Partners, which is a publicly traded affiliate of the Williams Companies, plans to pay for the deal with about $1.78 billion in cash and the issuance of 11.8 million ownership units worth about $720 million.
The deal is the latest to revolve around the boom in shale, in which companies extract natural gas and related materials from hardened rock through techniques like hydraulic fracturing. A wide array of companies are seeking to profit from the rush; among them are so-called midstream companies like Williams Partners, which focus on processing and transporting oil and natural gas products.
Caiman Eastern focuses on gathering and processing liquid-rich gases extracted from the Marcellus Shale, one of the most prominent formations of natural gas deposits in the country. The company has operations in northern West Virginia, southwestern Pennsylvania and eastern Pennsylvania.
All told, Caiman Eastern has commitments with 10 producers that cover 236,000 acres in the region. 
Its parent, Caiman Energy, is a privately held midstream energy company focused on developing shale assets. The company's principal owners include EnCap Investments and Highstar Capital.
Williams Partners has been focused on expanding its operations in the Marcellus Shale, including by building a supply hub in northeastern Pennsylvania that it claims will deliver more than three billion cubic feet a day to interstate pipelines.
Adding Caiman Eastern will add the ability to gather more than two billion cubic feet of natural gas a day and produce about 300,000 barrels of natural gas liquids a day by 2020.
"These new assets, anchored by long-term agreements with a diverse set of customers, give us a major presence in the liquids-rich portion of the Marcellus Shale," Alan Armstrong, Williams' chief executive, said in a statement. "We expect significant long-term growth potential because the liquids-rich gas makes this area the most economical and top-performing play for producers in North America."
Williams Partners also said that it would partner with Caiman in a joint venture to develop processing facilities in the Utica Shale, which is centered on Ohio and northwestern Pennsylvania.
The cash portion of the Caiman Eastern deal will be financed by Williams Partners equity, debt and cash on hand. Williams also intends on investing an additional $1 billion in its affiliate to help pay for the transaction.
Williams Partners was advised by Jefferies, UBS and the law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher. Caiman was advised by Barclays Capital, Citigroup and the law firm Vinson & Elkins.

HEADLINE: The Not-Much-Opportunity Society

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Even as research shows a widening gap in educational outcomes based on family income, public spending per child on early childhood education is declining, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential contender, likes to contrast his vision of an Opportunity Society in which people choose whether to pursue an education or hard work with an Entitlement Society, offered by President Obama, in which government provides every citizen the same or similar rewards.
I'm not sure what Entitlement Society he's talking about, since after-tax income has grown far more rapidly at the top than elsewhere, and federal taxes and transfers became less redistributive between 1979 and 2007. As far as I can tell, President Obama hasn't done much to reverse this trend.
But what is even more misleading about Mr. Romney's vision is its emphasis on grown-ups. Children, after all, can't simply choose to pursue an education. They are dependent on their parents, their communities and their fellow citizens for the opportunities to do so.
As the University of Chicago economist Gary Becker noted in his classic "Treatise on the Family" and his colleague James Heckman reiterated in a paper written with Flavio Cunha, children don't choose their own parents. They don't choose which country or state they are going to be born in, either, though geography has a huge impact on their life chances.
Public spending aimed at children in low-income families, including programs like Head Start, has garnered substantial political support precisely because it promises to enhance opportunities. Yet the Head Start program has never served more than 60 percent of eligible children in extreme poverty.
Since 2000, state support for early childhood education programs has almost doubled the enrollment of 4-year-olds in prekindergarten programs, to 27 percent from 14 percent. Increases in access, quality and coordination with early years of elementary school would improve both opportunity and outcomes for children.
Yet per-child spending on early childhood education has declined in the last two years, and the phase-out of the American Recovery and Investment Act will almost certainly lead to further cuts.
A recent Urban Institute report projects significant declines in federal spending on education and certain discretionary programs for children. Another shows that federal spending is more directly focused than state and local spending on children in families with incomes less than twice the poverty level. In 2010, about 44 percent of all children were living in such families.
Most of the federal benefits such children received took the form of direct assistance with basic health, nutrition, housing or education. Children in families with higher income received 82 percent of their benefits in the form of tax breaks.
Urban Institute researchers focus on a simple comparison between low-income families and others, because the data available doesn't make it possible to break out differences among those above 200 percent of the poverty line.
But a new book edited by the economists Greg J. Duncan and Richard Murnane, "Whither Opportunity," documents widening disparities in educational outcomes between children in poor and rich families, finding that educational mobility has declined over time.
Alan B. Krueger, chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, recently summarized international evidence that inequality among adults reduces economic mobility among children. As he puts it, "The fortunes of one's parents seem to matter increasingly in American society."
Mr. Romney didn't inherit his financial wealth. But he enjoyed an affluent upbringing that included the advantage of an excellent education.
He should acknowledge that entitlement isn't the opposite of opportunity but a necessary - even if not sufficient - condition for it.

HEADLINE: The Link Between Reading Level and Dropout Rates

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: A new report says that children who read below grade level in fourth grade are four times more likely to drop out of high school - and only 34 percent of America's fourth graders read at grade level. 

 BODY:
In 2010, President Obama, along with Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, Gen. Colin Powell and his wife, Alma Powell, co-chairwoman of America's Promise Alliance, a youth organization, introduced Grad Nation, a plan to reverse America's high school dropout rate. Even putting aside the obvious benefits to individual students, they argued that high school graduates fuel the economy, while dropouts cost taxpayer dollars. The alliance's latest report, issued on Monday, shows that we're making progress, but not fast enough - and highlights some of the reasons that every year, more than a million students don't make it to graduation on time, if at all.
Among those reasons is one that isn't exactly surprising, but isn't necessarily the first thing that might have come to mind. Children who aren't reading proficiently by fourth grade are four times more likely to drop out of high school, and according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, only 34 percent of America's fourth graders read at grade level. 
This may be because students are parsing the test questions too carefully, as Anne Stone and Jeff Nichols, parents and professors, did with friends one night in exploring the third-grade English-language practice test. But in most cases, particularly among black and Latino students (less than 20 percent of whom achieved reading proficiency by the fourth grade in 2011, a depressing number), it seems more likely that they're simply not reading comfortably - and it's scarcely news that if you can't read with confidence, school, from fourth grade on, is only going to get more challenging.
We already know that children who aren't engaged in kindergarten are less successful as they move through elementary school. Those children are less likely to read proficiently by fourth grade, and so they go on to drop out of high school at higher rates, with all that entails. In other words, we're losing many of these high school dropouts early: early enough that we should be able to bring many of them back with support for early-education programs, with attention to what makes a teacher successful in lower grades, and with an eye on the benchmark that those standardized tests so many middle-class parents love to hate offer.
I'm of the generation who learned early that reading is fundamental. Childhood literacy, and reading to and with children from infancy on, are passions of mine. I find myself surprised, and daunted, by this reminder of how far we haven't come, and what that means to the children who fell behind along the way.

HEADLINE: Oprah Winfrey Network to Lay Off 30

BYLINE: BRIAN STELTER


HIGHLIGHT: OWN, Oprah Winfrey's cable channel, said on Monday that it had decided to lay off 30 people in a restructuring of its operations. 

 BODY:
OWN, Oprah Winfrey's cable channel, said on Monday that it had decided to lay off 30 people in a restructuring of its operations in Los Angeles and New York.
The staff cutbacks are the latest public setback for the young channel, which is co-owned by Ms. Winfrey and Discovery Communications. The channel has suffered from executive turnover since its conception four years ago and from low ratings since its TV premiere 15 months ago. Last week, the channel canceled what was to have been one of its tent poles, "The Rosie Show," a 7 p.m. talk show by Rosie O'Donnell.
Amid the continuing drumbeat of departures and disappointing ratings, Ms. Winfrey's own talk show, "Oprah's Next Chapter," has sometimes brought in millions of viewers to the channel, proving that it could still succeed over the long term. Ms. Winfrey and Discovery executives have cautioned all along that the channel will take years to prove itself.
"It is difficult to make tough business decisions that affect people's lives, but the economics of a start-up cable network just don't work with the cost structure that was in place," Ms. Winfrey, the channel's chief executive, said in a statement on Monday. "As C.E.O., I have a responsibility to chart the course for long-term success for the network. To wholly achieve that long-term success, this was a necessary next step."
The layoffs were first reported by Deadline.com. Referring to the 30 eliminated jobs, OWN said that it would redistribute the responsibilities among the network, Discovery and Ms. Winfrey's production company, Harpo Studios.

HEADLINE: Before Illinois Primary, Santorum Talks of Brokered Convention

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney make last-minute appeals to Illinois voters. 

 BODY:
Rick Santorum again raised the specter of a brokered Republican convention on Monday as he sought to appeal to conservative voters in Illinois to deliver another setback to Mitt Romney's presidential ambitions in the state's primary on Tuesday.
The two men set out on Monday for a full day of campaigning across Illinois following a weekend in which Mr. Romney prevailed in Puerto Rico, winning more than 80 percent of the vote and capturing all of the commonwealth's 20 delegates.
A week-old poll shows Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum essentially tied in Illinois, which will award its 69 delegates proportionally, although Mr. Santorum is ineligible to get some of them. Nationwide, Mr. Romney holds a more than two-to-one lead over Mr. Santorum in the effort to collect delegates.
More recent polling, including some that use automated calls and do not survey cell phone users, suggests that Mr. Romney may have opened up a lead in Illinois in the last several days.
But Mr. Santorum remains insistent that he and the other Republican challengers are in a position to deny Mr. Romney the 1,144 delegates he needs to claim the party's nomination. In an appearance on CBS's "Early Show," Mr. Santorum said Mr. Romney could not win.
"The convention will nominate a conservative," Mr. Santorum said. "They will not nominate the establishment moderate candidate from Massachusetts. When we nominate moderates, when we nominate a Tweedledum versus Tweedledee, we don't win elections."
Asked about the odds of a brokered convention, Mr. Santorum said, "Obviously, they are increasing."
In a speech on the campus of the University of Chicago Monday afternoon, Mr. Romney assailed the economic policies of the Obama administration. 
"For the last three years, President Obama has expanded government instead of empowering the American people," Mr. Romney said. "He's put us deeper in debt. He's slowed the recovery, he's harmed the economy and he has attacked the cornerstone of American prosperity -- economic freedom."
It was the first major policy address, which Mr. Romney delivered in a formal setting on stage at International Hall, that he has given in weeks. He used the location, the president's backyard, as a moment to start his pivot to the general election.
"This November, we face a defining decision," Mr. Romney said. "Our choice will not be one of party or personality. This election will be about principle. Our economic freedom will be on the ballot and I intend to offer the American people a choice."
Mr. Romney and his allies continued to pound Mr. Santorum on the airwaves, describing him as an economic lightweight. And in a new video released Monday morning, the campaign aired footage of Mr. Santorum in 2008, praising Mr. Romney.
"This is Rick Santorum. I think everybody knows nobody puts words into my mouth," Mr. Santorum says as Mr. Romney stands beside him. "The words out of my mouth were that if you want a conservative as the nominee of this party, you must vote for Mitt Romney." 
Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, pointed to the four-year-old video as evidencethat Mr. Santorum had changed his tune in an effort to win the election this year.
"Rick Santorum is a Washington insider who is lashing out at Mitt Romney because he was embarrassed in Puerto Rico yesterday," Ms. Saul said. "This sounds like another case of Rick Santorum abandoning his principles for his own political advantage."
The Republican contest has seesawed back and forth in recent days, as Mr. Santorum scored key Southern victories last week and Mr. Romney won over the weekend. Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul largely conceded Puerto Rico and are not campaigning aggressively in Illinois, making the fight there largely a two-man affair.
Even as Mr. Santorum campaigns aggressively in Illinois, he is already looking past it to Saturday's primary in Louisiana. Mr. Santorum hopes to deliver another message to establishment Republicans that Mr. Romney cannot win among the party's core supporters.
In his CBS interview on Monday morning, Mr. Santorum echoed Democratic attacks on Mr. Romney as a person who flip-flops on important issues and doesn't hold strongly to any particular belief structure.
"I have a core. I'm someone who has really strong convictions about the limited role of government," said Mr. Santorum, adding that Mr. Romney is "someone who doesn't have a core. He's been on both sides of almost every single issue in the past 10 years."
Mr. Romney is scheduled to hold three events in Illinois on Monday, including a speech on what his campaign said would be "economic freedom" in Chicago.
In appearances across the state on Sunday, Mr. Romney stood with his wife, Ann, as the couple made direct appeals to female voters in Illinois.
"I love it that women are upset, too; that women are talking about the economy. I love that," Mrs. Romney said at a pancake breakfast. "Women are talking about jobs; women are talking about deficit spending. Thank you, women."
She concluded, with a direct plea: "We need you. We all need you in November, too. We have to remember why we're upset and what we've got to do to fix things."
Mr. Romney continued to hammer President Obama, keeping his eye on a general election battle that he hopes to be able to wage.
Speaking in Collinsville, Ill., on Saturday, Mr. Romney took aim at Steven Chu, the secretary of energy; Ken Salazar, the interior secretary; and Lisa Jackson, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
"I think it's time for him to fire his gas hike trio," Mr. Romney said. If not, he said, "they really ought to turn in their resignations. They were hired to raise the cost of gasoline; now the president says he wants to lower it."
During an appearance on CBS's "Face the Nation" program on Sunday, David Axelrod, a senior political strategist for Mr. Obama, chided Mr. Romney and the other Republican candidates for claiming that they could lower gas prices quickly.
"That's not oil talk, that's snake oil talk," Mr. Axelrod said. "And I think the American people know the difference."
In an e-mail to reporters on Monday, Mr. Obama's campaign attacked what it termed the "Massachusetts Myth" about Mr. Romney -- that he's an economic heavyweight who could get the country back on track.
"Mitt Romney can give yet another economic speech today," the memo concludes. "But his rhetoric can't hide his record, and his record of losing jobs and leaving the middle class behind is turning off the very voters he'd need in November if he becomes the Republican nominee."
And in an appearance in Springfield, Ill., Mr. Romney even acknowledged positive signs in the economy, according to Politico, saying, "The economy is coming back."

HEADLINE: Illinois Tip Sheet: Must-Reads From a Political Pro

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: A guide to the politics of the Land of Lincoln and Barack Obama -- and Al Capone and Rod Blagojevich -- by Thom Serafin, a veteran Illinois strategist, before the primary on Tuesday. 

 BODY:
Illinois might be the Land of Lincoln and Barack Obama, but it's just as famous for Al Capone and Rod Blagojevich. 
The state is once again in the national spotlight, though for an unusual reason: its Republicans are poised to vote on Tuesday in a race that could be crucial for Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum as they fight for the chance to take on Illinois's adopted son in the White House.
For a deeper look at the state's politics and voters, we asked Thom Serafin (@ThomSerafin), a veteran Illinois political consultant, to curate a list of "must-reads." Before founding his strategic communications firm, Serafin & Associates in 1988, Mr. Serafin was a political reporter and a state manager for Gary Hart's presidential campaign, and an aide to Senator Alan J. Dixon, an Illinois Democrat.
His tip sheet outlines Illinois's long and recent history of backroom dealing, its economic struggles, the broader implications of Tuesday's primary and its political geography.

        
A Modern Political Primer, Illinois Issues, October 1999
Why, in 2012, should we read a "modern" primer written in 1999, we asked. Mr. Serafin's explains: "John Dowling, former Associated Press reporter wrote this illuminating piece of how he witnessed (over 25 years) the state of Illinois politicos work together while news editor for The Associated Press. What I continue to find striking is that it was written several years before the Democratic Party in Illinois slated Rod Blagojevich to run for governor -- he was elected to two terms. Governor Blagojevich recently was sentenced to 14 years in federal prison. He started serving his federal prison term last week."
        
Illinois' Lost Decade, The Chicago Tribune, March 15, 2012
A Chicago Tribune editorial looks at the "sorry spirals of a corrupt governor and his broke, broken state," and notes that many of Mr. Blagojevich's "legislative protectors" are on the ballot on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Santorum Waves Away Economics

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Defying almost all conventional wisdom about the 2012 election, Rick Santorum said the race would not turn on the economy and so it wasn't important if unemployment and growth rates rose or fell. 

 BODY:
MOLINE, Ill. -- Defying almost all conventional wisdom about the 2012 election, Rick Santorum said the race would not turn on the economy and so it wasn't important if unemployment and growth rates rose or fell. 
Seeking to sharply contrast himself with Mitt Romney, Mr. Santorum waved away economics as he went after his chief rival as insufficiently conservative in his core values. 
"I don't care what the unemployment rate's going to be," Mr. Santorum said on Monday, the day before the Illinois primary. "It doesn't matter. My campaign doesn't hinge on unemployment rates and growth rates. There's something more foundational that's going on here."
Earlier in the day, Mr. Romney had delivered a major speech at the campus of the University of Chicago in which he lambasted President Obama's economic policies, presenting himself as the Republicans' best possible opponent. Mr. Santorum, in effect, dismissed Mr. Romney's wheelhouse issue as irrelevant. 
Mr. Santorum has uttered a string of comments that have leaped out and required clarification and backfilling -- including on contraception, college and making English the official language of Puerto Rico - and this may prove to be another. He frequently boasts of not having a pollster or speechwriter and being unscripted. 
Earlier on Monday, Mr. Santorum attacked Mr. Romney as being unfit to represent the Republican Party because of his support, while governor of Massachusetts, for a state mandate to buy health care.
At his third stop of the day here in western Illinois, Mr. Santorum attacked Mr. Romney's claim to be the best alternative to President Obama because of his expertise as a businessman. 
"You have one nominee who says he wants to run the economy," Mr. Santorum said. "What kind of conservative says the president runs the economy? What kind of conservative says, 'I'm the guy that because of my economic experience, that can create jobs'? We conservatives tend to think the government doesn't create jobs."
Asked about the remarks later, Mr. Santorum told reporters he did care about unemployment. "I'm saying my candidacy doesn't hinge on whether the unemployment rate goes up or down."
He spoke to a supportive crowd that came to its feet many times. Mr. Santorum made clear he considered a victory in Illinois unlikely, but he said if he won "amazing things can happen."
While Mr. Santorum spent Monday delivering some of his most lacerating attacks yet on Mr. Romney, his rival never alluded to him, directing his fire at the president. To do the dirty work, Mr. Romney has been able to rely on his campaign machine and his "super PAC," which hammered away at Mr. Santorum on the airwaves, including a new ad which shows Mr. Santorum endorsing Mr. Romney in 2008 as a model conservative. 
"If we're able to do what I know most people think is impossible -- carry the state of Illinois -- it would fundamentally change this election," Mr. Santorum said. "It will put us in the position where they'll stop talking about delegates and start talking about how to stop Rick Santorum from being the nominee."
It was his biggest applause line of the afternoon.

HEADLINE: Romney Makes Final Pitch to Illinois Voters

BYLINE: STEVEN YACCINO


HIGHLIGHT: On the eve of the state's Republican primary, Mr. Romney lambasted the policies of President Obama for "attacking economic freedom day in and day out." 

 BODY:
PEORIA, Ill. - On the eve of the Republican primary in Illinois, Mitt Romney made his final pitch to voters at Bradley University on Monday night, where he lambasted the policies of President Obama for "attacking economic freedom day in and day out."
"I don't think it's because he means to hurt things," he said at the outdoor town-hall event, ending a day spent zigzagging across the state. "I just think because of his lack of experience in the private sector - never really having had a job in the private sector, he doesn't know that what he's doing is hurting so badly and harming so many families."
As in a speech he gave earlier in the day at the University of Chicago, Mr. Romney criticized government over-regulation and Mr. Obama's administration, but did not mention his Republican opponents in Tuesday's primary election. 
Speaking at Bradley, against the backdrop of a castlelike building in the middle of campus, he again addressed his remarks directly to students in the audience.
"When the government steps in with the heavy hand of regulation, steps in with greater and greater taxes, steps in by destroying the marketplace, that extinguishes dreams," he said. "And if those dreams are extinguished, our economy won't create the jobs you need as you come out of school." 
Later, when talking about the national debt, he added, "You not only have college loans to pay back, you have loans to my generation to pay back."
But students weren't the only ones in attendance. 
Nearby, Rick Santorum scheduled a rally at a restaurant in East Peoria later on Monday night, giving undecided voters in the area like Jerry Rapp, 66, a rare opportunity to see the two candidates speak back-to-back before making up their mind. 
"It's a really good tossup for us," said Mr. Rapp, who drove with his wife from nearby Bloomington to compare how well Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum talked about their plans for the economy. "We could support either one very strongly." 
David Gruber, 50, who seemed less enthusiastic about the candidates, said he was leaning toward Mr. Santorum because he liked his strong stance on social issues. 
"He doesn't hide them," he said at Bradley University, where he came to give Mr. Romney one last shot. "He doesn't run away from them, and I'd like to see if Romney does that, as well." 
"I'm willing to let him convince me," he said just before the event started. 
Mr. Romney got his chance when it came time for questions. Many of his answers covered his positions on the cost of education, the housing market, energy policy and health care and laid out broader themes about how he would govern as president. 
The first question, however, was by far the fieriest: "You know what would make me happy?" asked a woman in the audience. "Free birth control." 
There were cheers from some in the audience. 
"Look, let me tell you something," Mr. Romney responded. "If you're looking for free stuff - if you're looking for free stuff you don't have to pay for, vote for the other guy. That's what he's all about."
Others in the crowd cheered just as loud.

HEADLINE: The Uses of Polarization

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: As the electorate becomes more ideological, the balancing act for presidential candidates gets harder. 

 BODY:
A primary goal of a presidential campaign is to incrementally increase margins of support among volatile and persuadable demographic groups like single women angered by attempts to restrict access to contraception or voters with long commutes worried about gas prices.
A second goal is increase turnout among supportive voting blocs - conservative whites in the case of Republicans, African-Americans in the case of Democrats. This goal is accomplished most often with polarizing tactics like the exploitation of wedge issues.
The target constituencies can be huge - white men, Hispanics, seniors - or, with the emergence of sophisticated micro-technology, smaller slices of the electorate, ranging from laid-off manufacturing workers to women golfers.
This is not news, but how does such a strategy actually work? A source who was willing to be identified only as a Republican strategist with extensive experience in national campaigns described to me in an e-mail how he looks at an election in which there are no significant independent candidates:
White Independents. G.O.P. needs to win by double-digits.Moderates. G.O.P. loses by 20 or less, you win, lose by 30 or more, you lose.Latinos - what percent of the electorate do they represent? What's the margin? Nationally, if Latinos are 8 percent of the electorate, and the Democratic-Republican spread is within 25 points [37.5 Republican - 62.5 Democratic], that's good. If in 2012, it's Latinos are 10 percent of the electorate, and the Democratic-Republican spread is voting Democratic 35 points or more [32.5 R - 67.5 D], that's serious trouble.White women. Win by 5 to 9 percentage points, you win. Break even or lose, serious trouble. Overall, in 2012, we are looking at the G.O.P. having to win white voters by +19 points if Latino composition is unusually high.That actually means white men over 60 have to be huge for Republicans - and you can't let Dems make serious inroads among white women over 60.Downscale whites - Obama approval has to be roughly in the mid-30s and he has to get whomped - while white college grad job approval cannot be higher than the low 40s.Whites age 18-29 - you have to carry them. McCain lost by them 10 percentage points and he got totally swamped.
While the thinking of professional operatives may seem cynical or excessively calculating, it is a key element of election preparation by both Democrats and Republicans.
Democrats, for example, consistently seek to raise turnout among union members, urban voters, Hispanics and, since the emergence of the gender gap in the 1980 election between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, female voters.
In the 2004 election, the Bush-Cheney campaign explicitly sought to polarize voters to increase turnout among potential supporters.
Matthew Dowd, who ran polling and much of the planning for Bush, explained the 2004 Republican strategy to me just after the election. "Most voters looked at Bush in very black-and-white terms," he said. "They either loved and respected him, or they didn't like him." In the face of this reality, "we systematically allocated all the main resources of the campaign to the twin goals of motivation and persuasion. The media, the voter targeting, the mail - all were based off that strategic decision."
Politically, the 2004 strategy was a striking success. Four years earlier, in 2000, when Bush campaigned as a "compassionate conservative" with the goal of minimizing polarization, he had not been so fortunate, losing the popular vote by a margin of 500,000, and taking the ballots of voters calling themselves "independent" by only 2 points. He won the Electoral College by a slim 271-266 margin (or 5-4, as some liberals like to say).
In 2004, Bush did much better, losing independent voters by one point, but carrying the Electoral College by 286-251 and winning the popular vote by 3 million. In other words, polarizing tactics that divide the opposition party, pitting pro-gay-rights Democrats against anti-gay-rights Democrats, for example, may have contributed to Bush's diminished support from independent voters. Those losses, however, were more than made up for by gains among voters already inclined to cast a ballot for Bush, but who needed stronger motivation to go out and do it.
The Bush 2004 campaign and its allies made heavy use of wedge issues - from stem cell research to attacks on John Kerry's Vietnam war record - to raise Republican turnout and depress Democratic voting.
The basic approach of building support among key demographics does not, however, always require divisive maneuvers. There are multiple ways to deal with diverse constituencies, including raising the numbers of ballots cast by members of reliable groups, suppressing turnout among hostile groups and keeping margins of defeat, where possible, to a minimum.
It is almost certain that President Obama will not carry a majority of white voters without college degrees, a basically Republican bloc. He can, however, try to keep his losses among these voters to, say, 42-58, instead of a more damaging 33-67 margin. The possibility of making gains with this group has been improved for Obama by the prospect of running against Mitt Romney, whose campaign has struggled in the primaries with this sector of the electorate.
The Obama campaign's attempt to cut into the Republican advantage among white working-class voters was on display last Thursday when Vice President Biden appeared at a United Auto Workers rally in Toledo. "Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich - these guys have a fundamentally different economic philosophy than we do," Biden told the cheering crowd. "In 2009, no one was lining up to lend General Motors or Chrysler any money or, for that matter, lend any money to anybody. That includes Bain Capital. They weren't lining up to lend anybody money."
Over the past decade, campaigns have been taking giant steps forward in their use of technological advances like microtargeting, improved analytical and statistical models and other data-heavy mechanisms, which they use to identify and locate key supporters and persuadable voters. Micah Sifry, co-founder of the Personal Democracy Forum, argues that Obama's aggressive development of predictive modeling, data mining, social networking and other fine-grained techniques may prove crucial. "If the 2012 election comes down to a battle of inches," Sifry writes, "where a few percentage points change in turnout in a few key states, making all the difference, we may come to see Obama's investment in predictive modelers and data scientists as the key to victory."
The power of campaigns to create and motivate new swing voters dovetails with the political strategy of driving polarization. Information science has geometrically improved the ability of campaigns to accurately identify specific voters who are angry or threatened and most easily motivated by hard-edged, divisive messages, on such issues as race, taxes, welfare and other hot-button subjects.
The key is that this technological innovation is taking place within the larger context of increased ideological consistency across the two parties. "Since 1960, the two parties have evolved from miscellaneous coalitions of regional interests spanning the ideological spectrum into two unified and ideologically coherent political parties, on the European model," Michael W. McConnell, a professor of law at Stanford University, writes. The Democratic Party was formerly made up of "two distinct and ideologically incompatible elements: a white, conservative, largely racist Southern Democratic Party, and a mixed-race, more progressive Northern Democratic Party," McConnell points out. Motivated by the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the two parties began to reconstitute themselves as consistently left and right, a process that continues to this day.
Bitter social, moral and cultural conflict has driven up turnout: as voters become more ideological, they develop a stronger interest in the outcome of elections, and a greater likelihood of going to the polls on election day. "Those Americans whose attitudes and behavior most closely reflect the ideals of democratic citizenship are the most partisan and the most polarized. In contrast, it is among the uninterested, uninformed, and uninvolved that moderation and independence flourish," Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University, wrote in his recently published book, "The Polarized Public."
At the same time, the percentage of the electorate that can accurately be described as independent - without partisan allegiance - has shrunk to about 7 percent, according to Ruy Teixeira of the Brookings Institution. While the importance of such voters has diminished, in a closely balanced contest these relatively uninvolved men and women have the power to determine the outcome: in the 12 presidential elections from 1964 to 2008, four - 1968, 1976, 2000 and 2004 - have been decided by 2.5 percentage points or less.
Perhaps the most important factor going into the 2012 general election will be the most difficult to gauge: the degree to which the candidates themselves motivate or turn off voters. A detailed analysis of the 2008 presidential turnout by Arthur Lupia, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, concluded that "when considering whether or not to support John McCain in 2008, a number of Bush voters decided, 'No We Can't.' The number of 2004 Bush voters who decided to stay at home, or to support a Democrat, in 2008 did not grab the same kinds of headlines as new voter stories, but they were a sufficient condition for Obama's Electoral College victory."
Democratic voter enthusiasm has been running well below 2008 levels, indicating that this time around, Obama faces a substantial hurdle in replicating the surge in turnout that helped propel him into the White House four years ago - although there has been some improvement recently. Conversely, Mitt Romney, the odds-on favorite to win the Republican nomination, has so far demonstrated little ability to inspire Republican loyalists, showing weaknesses similar to those that characterized Bob Dole's 1996 and McCain's 2008 campaigns.
The strategic choices facing both Obama, who has moved to the left in recent months, and Romney, who is well to the right of where he was in 2008, are not easy. Every approach presents significant dangers. 
In each of the 12 to 15 battleground states, from New Hampshire to Nevada, the campaigns will have to make a decision. If they choose to focus on the small fraction of independent or swing voters, then a more centrist strategy wins out; if they choose to galvanize the base, then a more ideological and polarizing strategy will dominate, putting their standing with independents at risk. But if they focus on their core voters, independents may be repulsed. 
As the electorate itself becomes more and more polarized, the balancing act gets harder and harder. In this sense, as each candidate seeks to incrementally increase margins of support among key constituencies and to intensify participation not only among "pure" independents but also among loyal voting blocs, Obama and Romney face the same problem.

HEADLINE: Senate Debates So-Called Small-Business Bill

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Critics of the JOBS Act, who believe the bill isn't really about small businesses, fear the debate may be over. 

 BODY:
The Senate has taken up the House's so-called JOBS bill, which ostensibly makes it easier for small companies, and many large ones as well, to seek investment in the capital markets, and there are conflicting and confusing reports about what will become of the House's handiwork on the Senate floor. Though described as a small-business bill, the House's legislation, as we reported on Tuesday, eases disclosure and oversight requirements for small and giant corporations alike, and some critics of the House's work had hoped Senate Democrats would temper some of the JOBS bill's more controversial provisions.
Indeed, on Thursday, Senators Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Carl Levin of Michigan, and Jack Reed of Rhode Island introduced what they called the INVEST Act (for "The Invigorate New Ventures and Entrepreneurs to Succeed Today in America Act of 2012"). The INVEST Act addresses two of the concerns raised in the earlier post: it would limit so-called emerging growth companies to those with annual revenue of $350 million or less (as opposed to $1 billion in the House bill), and it would raise the number of shareholders of record that obligate a public company to make regular disclosures to the Securities and Exchange Commission from 500 to just 750 -- instead of the 2,000 stipulated by the House bill. It would also apply more oversight and investor protection to "crowdfunded" public offerings.
But on Friday, Roll Call, the Capitol Hill news service, reported, essentially, that the fix was in. Roll Call explained that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had structured the debate so that the alternative proposed by the Senate Democrats had little chance of passing.
According to Roll Call, Mr. Reid:
moved to limit amendments on a House-passed JOBS Act and set up two procedural votes for Tuesday - the only amendments expected to be offered to the measure. The first vote Tuesday will be whether to cut off debate on a Democratic substitute package that includes many of the changes some Democrats were hoping to make as part of a Senate version of the House bill. Offering it as an amendment, rather than the underlying bill, often makes it harder to prevail on the Senate floor.
The amendment would require 60 votes to pass, and it is "unclear," as Roll Call put it, whether any Republicans would vote for it. Seven Republicans would need to join the entire Democratic caucus for the amendment to pass.
The other vote that Mr. Reid has allowed would cut off debate on an amendment that would reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, a government entity that helps finance foreign purchases of American. goods. The bank's legal authority expires at the end of May, and it is fast approaching its $100 billion lending cap. That amendment has bipartisan support and is expected to pass.
Then, presumably, the Senate would vote on the House JOBS bill, unchanged except for the Export-Import Bank reauthorization. Roll Call's interviews with several Democratic skeptics suggest that most of them are resigned to voting in favor of what one called "a deeply flawed House bill."
But if anyone deserves blame, or credit, for the speed with which the JOBS bill appears likely to become law, it's the White House. President Obama's enthusiastic support for the measures - he actually proposed some of them himself, in broad terms - gave House Democrats little cover to oppose the omnibus bill last week, even though their support was tepid at best, and even less cover for Senate Democrats this week, now that the House has voted so decisively.
NPR has reported that the White House on Thursday "supports efforts to safeguard against abuse" (those are NPR's words, not the White House's), but the opportunity for that - and for limiting the bill to truly small companies - is fading fast.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths KAUFMAN, MELVYN

 BODY:
KAUFMAN--Melvyn, 87, of Mamaroneck, died peacefully at his home with his wife Liz at his side on Sunday March 18, 2012. Beloved husband of Elizabeth H. Atwood. He was born to the late William and Esther Kaufman, (d. respectively 1976 and 1984). His older brother, Bennett, who died in 1980, predeceased him. His younger brother, Robert, survives him. 
Together with his brother, Robert, they advanced The William Kaufman Organization and Sage Realty Corporation, started by their father William, to the level of one of most respected and honored real estate ventures in New York City and the entire country. As a young man Melvyn learned the construction business "the hard way", by working for his father as a day laborer. lt was from this early experience that he realized that he had found his true love - architecture and construction. Melvyn attended New York University and Long Island University. This was interrupted by his military service as an infantry soldier in Europe in World War II. After the war ended Melvyn did not return to school. Instead, he went to work for his father. He started his career as a builder of shopping centers and small commercial buildings, but the company's and his attention soon turned to bigger things in the booming postwar economy of New York City -the high rise office building. In the early 1950's WKO built its' First New York City buildings, 711 Third Avenue and 405 Park Avenue. Several years later 777 Third Avenue followed and over the next several decades continued to develop large New York City office building projects. These include 437 Madison Avenue, 767 Third Avenue, 747 Third Avenue, 127 John Street, 77 Water Street and 17 State Street. Melvyn was a guest professor at Cooper Union and at Pratt School of Architecture. He lectured at McGill University, Ohio University, New York University and many other architectural schools. He spoke before the American Institute of Architects and the Architectural League of New York. Melvyn was Chairman of the Stoneyard Institute of The Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City. His first wife and mother of their children, Claire, who died in 1987, predeceased Melvyn. Melvyn is survived by three children: Jerian Franco and Kim Kaufman, of New York City and Karin Kaufman of Pound Ridge. Four grandchildren also survive him: Samantha, Daniel, William and James. Two stepchildren survive Melvyn: Richard Metz Jr. of New York City and Jane Robinson of West Hartford, CT. He is also survived by three step-grandchildren: Courtney, John, and Thomas. Many nieces and nephews as well as many great-nieces and great-nephews also survive Melvyn. ln lieu of flowers, the family is requesting that donations be made out to Berwick Boys Foundation, 335 West Street, West Bridgewater, MA 02379 or www.berwick.org. Family will be receiving friends at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Avenue New York, NY 10028, Wednesday March 21, 2012 3pm-5pm and 7pm-9pm. A service will be held Thursday March 22, 2012 at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home at 11:30am followed with burial later that afternoon at Kensico Cemetery.

HEADLINE: What Do Declining Birthrates Mean for the World?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Fertility Implosion,'' by David Brooks (column, March 13):
Falling global fertility rates are hardly a cause for handwringing pessimism. 
We should celebrate the advances that come from access to affordable voluntary contraception and the empowerment of women. The benefits to individuals and families are obvious. But communities and countries gain, too.
As societies shift to smaller families, there are more resources available for health and education. Improvements in those areas can lead to greater productivity. And that, in turn, can provide the financial resources needed to provide for an aging population.
All things considered, it's a far less daunting challenge than is posed by endless population growth in a world with limited resources.
JOHN SEAGER President, Population Connection Washington, March 14, 2012
To the Editor:
David Brooks's column about a global fertility implosion carries important implications for immigration policy. In particular, his analysis suggests that keeping relatively open borders will be critical to maintaining our position in the global economy.
However overpopulated the world may be as a whole, there is no question that it will be more difficult for countries with low population replacement rates to pay for the retirement of their elders. And societies struggling under that burden will be less competitive globally.
CLAIRE LAPORTE Cambridge, Mass., March 13, 2012
To the Editor:
David Brooks writes that lower birthrates will result in a lower American living standard.
First, that may not be true; perhaps America and other countries will get smarter about the way they work, live and consume.
But more important, fewer people on this planet could very well mean less pollution and destruction of natural habitats, and greater biodiversity. That would be good for all living things, including self-serving humans.

HEADLINE: Singing Gershwin Ella Style, Salt Added

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Who would dispute that George and Ira Gershwin, Ella Fitzgerald and Nelson Riddle were pop-jazz Olympians whose combined talents on the 1959 album ''Ella Fitzgerald Sings the George and Ira Gershwin Song Book'' resulted in a masterpiece of the LP era? Any notion of recreating that album, or even part of it, in concert is a daunting challenge. The list of contemporary musicians who could equal their talents is very short. 
But on Friday evening, the New York Pops and the singer Patti Austin performed a partial restoration at Carnegie Hall, where they offered more than a dozen selections from that album, using the original Riddle orchestrations.
Ms. Austin, who saluted Fitzgerald in a 2002 album, ''For Ella,'' and the Gershwins in her 2007 album, ''Avant Gershwin,'' is one of a very few vocal candidates for that short list. In some of the same ways as Fitzgerald's, her singing is technically perfect. She has faultless intonation and a solid rhythmic footing. At the same time she is less of a jazz singer and more of a soul singer in the mold of high-gloss studio voices, like James Ingram, her sometime singing partner.
Ms. Austin's voice is more thickly textured and earthbound than that of Fitzgerald, who, whether swinging or scatting or dripping honey over a ballad, evoked a quality I can only describe as heavenly consolation.
Ms. Austin is more overtly dramatic. If the humor conveyed by Fitzgerald was a girlish sense of mischief, Ms. Austin has a streak of salty wit. Introducing the Gershwins' ''Who Cares?,'' a song that blithely exclaims, ''Let a million firms go under,'' she amusedly recalled the grim reaction of an audience of corporate high rollers when she performed it in San Francisco on one of the worst days of the 2008 financial crisis.
But because of persistent acoustic problems that muddied Ms. Austin's voice and left it too far in the background, the concert was not all it might have been. As is so often the case at New York Pops concerts, the communication between the performer and the conductor Steven Reineke was minimal. Riddle's arrangements -- classical and cinematic with elegant, lacy musical designs floated over a strong, swinging foundation -- were blurred along with the vocals.
Christopher Riddle, the arranger's son, also conducted two excerpts from his father's ''Cross Country Suite,'' as well as his theme from the television series ''Route 66.'' If these are not major compositions, Mr. Riddle and the orchestra effectively brought out their pictorial vivacity.

HEADLINE: Amid Wall Street Giants, a Firm Thinks Small and Exclusive

BYLINE: By EVELYN M. RUSLI

 BODY:
When courting new business, Wall Street's deal makers often point to their long client lists as proof of deep industry knowledge.
Three Ocean Partners takes the opposite approach. The three-month-old boutique firm pitches clients on the promise of exclusivity, pledging to take just one account per industry.
That strategy makes it virtually impossible for Three Ocean to climb to the top of the prized league tables that tally up the standings in mergers and acquisitions. But the firm's founder, David W. Knowlton, a longtime banker, says the goal is to stay small. ''We'll never be a big firm,'' he said. ''We never want to be more than 25 or 30 people.'' 
In many ways, Three Ocean, which operates out of a historic Art Deco building in Midtown Manhattan, resembles the original Wall Street model, when the industry was dominated by close-knit partnerships. Started last December, the advisory shop now has nine professionals, most of whom will have a personal stake in the firm. Employees are also encouraged to invest in deals.
The pay packages also echo the past. At a time when investment banks are cutting compensation and shifting to stock bonuses, Three Ocean plans to pay bonuses entirely in cash. It is also offering other perks like unlimited vacation days and monthly wine tastings.
''For the person who is a true entrepreneur, this is a unique opportunity and structure to do better than Wall Street,'' said Mr. Knowlton. He said his firm had been fielding hundreds of calls from bankers and headhunters.
Boutique firms - which tend to focus on investment banking - have their own drawbacks. Many small financial firms struggle to pay their overhead while others are dependent on a handful of rainmakers to bring in clients. Kaufman Brothers, a boutique bank founded in 1995, closed this year after a slowdown in deal flow and trading activity.
''When you're on a smaller scale, you have to fight for every deal,'' said Devin Ryan, a managing director at Sandler O'Neill & Partners.
But boutiques are gaining traction, capitalizing on big banks' bruised reputations since the financial crisis. The market share of the 10 largest firms, by fees, dropped to 36.3 percent last year, from 42.2 percent in 2007, according to data from Thomson Reuters.
''The industry is suffering from a reputation problem,'' said Roy Smith, a professor at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University. ''This creates an opportunity for boutiques.''
Mr. Knowlton never imagined he would end up on Wall Street. As a teenager in Urbana, Ohio, he planned on running the family's construction business or going into public service. While a student at Kenyon College, he majored in political philosophy and had an internship at the Joint Economic Committee in Washington.
But after graduation, he gravitated toward finance. In late 1980, Mr. Knowlton felt the economy was starting to turn a corner, he said. Eager for some finance experience to apply to the family business, he joined the training program at Manufacturers Hanover Trust, a New York-based bank that ultimately became a part of JPMorgan Chase after a string of mergers. Later, at Chemical Bank, he trained under James B. Lee, the firm's noted deal maker and JPMorgan's current vice chairman, who often told him, ''Never tell your client you can't get it done; always find a solution before you go back to the client,'' Mr. Knowlton said.
After a stint at Gleacher & Company, Mr. Knowlton started his own firm, Watch Hill Partners, in 2003. Over seven years, the firm - a group of roughly 25 - advised on more than $30 billion of deals, working with Hershey Trust on its attempted takeover of Cadbury and with the Hicks Sports Group on its sale of the Liverpool Football Club.
In 2009, he sold the business to FBR Capital Markets. But FBR, a larger operation with an equities arm and other units, was ultimately a mismatch for Mr. Knowlton, who wanted to focus solely on mergers and acquisitions.
''When you sell your firm to another firm, the culture you had inevitably changes,'' he said.
Mr. Knowlton, 54, saw Three Ocean as an opportunity to start over again.
He had three priorities for his new firm: find a patient investor base, focus on a small group of clients and think globally. While the firm is still raising funds, it has signed up several prominent backers, including the Galvins, the founding family of Motorola, and Sanford Robertson, the founder of Robertson, Stephens & Company, a once high-flying technology boutique bank.
Three Ocean has five clients, which are considering transactions ranging from $100 million to several billion. One major financial firm has tapped Three Ocean to lead the sale of up to $2 billion worth of assets over the next few years. As the firm was still taking shape, Three Ocean advised MidOcean Partners, a private equity firm, on its $650 million purchase last June of PrePaid Legal Services.
While the Three Ocean Partners sales pitch may prove attractive to clients, it also comes with some big challenges.
Mr. Knowlton, for example, is intent on building a global operation and is establishing a London office. But with a small staff, he can build only so many satellite offices. Instead, Three Ocean will have to rely on international partnerships with other firms, which could come with conflicts.
Its one company per sector policy means it will miss out on lucrative assignments. Two weeks ago, Mr. Knowlton decided to turn down the opportunity to pitch one business, because it was already courting a competitor. In the end, Three Ocean may not win either deal.
But Mr. Knowlton is willing to give up some opportunities now as he aims to build a long-term business.
''We'll have to turn down business, even if a bigger company comes along,'' he said. ''If we won both deals, it would breach what we stood for.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: BP Settlement, Milestone for Some Gulf Spill Victims, Proves a Setback for Others

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Denise Spivacke Haralson and her husband, Larry, figured that they almost had their money. They had settled Mr. Haralson's claims against BP for the losses he suffered as a construction worker in the economic slump after the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
With the settlement papers signed in November, they had been dealing with last bits of paperwork and had been waiting for a $14,600 check. Mr. Haralson had planned to get away from the sluggish construction market in Ocean Springs, Miss., and head up to booming North Dakota. But they needed the settlement money to get him there. 
That is when BP and the core group of plaintiffs in the case announced that they had reached an uncapped settlement that BP estimates at $7.8 billion for individuals and businesses suing the company. The settlement involved shutting down the claims center that BP had set up at the request of the Obama administration, and which had handed out more than $6 billion so far.
Under the agreement, it is being replaced by another center that will be run under the court's supervision, with new rules that plaintiffs' lawyers argued would probably give plaintiffs more money than the old Gulf Coast Claims Facility. However, the Haralsons will not be getting the money right away. Under the new deal, once the new center is up and running, anyone with a settlement offer will get 60 percent of the original offer, and then the 40 percent will be judged under the new rules.
No one, the lawyers have emphasized, would have to accept less than the original offer, but that is little satisfaction for Ms. Haralson. ''Now they tell us we have to wait again?'' she said, fuming. ''We feel they've broken our contract.''
The proposed settlement between BP and individual and business plaintiffs over the spill has not even been fleshed out yet, but there are already lawyers and clients complaining that they have been inconvenienced or cut out. People like Ms. Haralson are upset that they have to wait on deals they had already closed. And some groups of plaintiffs have found themselves excluded entirely. The complaints suggest that the path to settlement promises to be a rocky one for many who say they were made victims twice: first by the spill, and then by a baffling legal process.
Mr. Haralson is one of thousands of people represented by the Mississippi Center for Justice, which received money from the Gulf Coast Claims Facility to help guide people through the process without charge. The group's financing runs out in June, said John Jopling, managing attorney in its Biloxi office. With the new settlement, lawyers are scouting the gulf region to sign up clients. But, he asked, ''Where is the resource that will allow them to get a free lawyer to help with the process?''
Richard Drummond, another client of the Mississippi organization, said he was ready for a change, however, having found dealing with the Gulf Coast Claims Facility a ''very frustrating, very disappointing process.'' Compared with that, he said, ''I think anything could be an improvement.''
Among the groups not included in the proposed settlement are those suing BP over the deaths and injuries caused by the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig. The deal is structured as a class action, and those cases have unique features that make it impossible to include them within a class, BP and the plaintiffs' group agreed. Lawyers for those families have long tried to get their cases detached from the complex tangle of federal litigation and transferred to state courts, or to settle them. Steven J. Gordon, who has at least three cases whose status is unclear, said, ''We're in limbo.''
Ernest Cannon, a Texas lawyer, represents the widow of a rig worker who settled with the previous fund, administered by Kenneth R. Feinberg, but has not received payment. Mr. Cannon said he had received little guidance about what to do until Wednesday, when Judge Carl J. Barbier of Federal District Court in New Orleans issued a terse order saying that ''although it should not be necessary to state the obvious,'' his order recognizing the settlement proposal should not prevent other settlements with the oil company. An e-mail to lawyers from Stephen J. Herman, a leader of the plaintiffs' group, noted that BP had agreed to honor any ''valid current existing offer.''
The brief order left Mr. Cannon unsatisfied, he said. ''While it may be obvious to some, it will only be obvious to me when I see BP issue a check,'' he said.
Another group that has no place in the settlement is made up of people who say they suffered economic losses caused by the temporary gulf drilling moratorium imposed by the Obama administration. BP opposed the inclusion of these cases in the settlement, saying the moratorium was not directly caused by the spill; those claims, which were also excluded from consideration by the Gulf Coast Claims Facility, will now have to go to court.
''It is time for BP to pay these companies or it is time for the court to let me try my cases,'' said Gladstone N. Jones III, a New Orleans lawyer representing many businesses that suffered a financial sting from the moratorium.
Edward F. Sherman, a former dean of Tulane Law School, said that the new criteria for settlement should put more money in the pockets of claimants than the methodology employed by the Feinberg fund, and that the fact that the settlement includes long-term health care monitoring for those on the Gulf Coast spreads the benefit broadly. There will always be people unhappy with any settlement, he said, but ''I think, by and large, it's an agreement that's favorable to a lot more people.''

HEADLINE: Flush With Cash, Apple Declares Dividend and Buyback

BYLINE: By NICK WINGFIELD; Christine Hauser contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Apple announced on Monday that it would at last return some of its cash pile to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks, at a cost of more than $10 billion a year for the next three years. But it is attracting so much cash -- $1 billion a week in the last holiday season alone -- that the move will not put a dent in Apple's coffers.
Apple's decision to pay the dividend was long awaited, yet it is an extraordinary one for a company that, despite its age, is growing more like a start-up.
While paying dividends is often a sign of cash-rich companies that are running out of big growth opportunities to invest in, Apple, founded in 1976, has not yet reached that level of maturity. It continues to pump out huge new technology hits like the iPhone and iPad, and its sales in the recent holiday quarter grew 73 percent from the period in 2010, which itself was 70 percent higher than the holiday 2009 quarter. And, late Monday, Apple said it had sold three million of its new iPads since they were introduced on Friday. 
Apple's cash reached nearly $100 billion at the end of last year, a level that seemed increasingly unjustifiable to many investors, who fret about how little interest Apple earns on the money, estimated at less than 1 percent. Apple's cash figure is almost twice the cash balance of the company with the next biggest hoard, Microsoft.
''They have a ridiculous amount of cash,'' said Douglas J. Skinner, a professor of accounting at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. ''There's no feasible acquisition that Apple could do that would need that much cash.''
Apple executives said the move was also intended to attract a new class of investors. Many investment funds have rules that prevent them from owning a stock unless it pays a dividend.
The decision to share some of its cash with stockholders also resonated symbolically. It is one of the clearest signs of change at Apple under the leadership of Timothy D. Cook, who became chief executive after Steven P. Jobs stepped down in August. Mr. Jobs, who died from complications of pancreatic cancer in October, long resisted calls to issue dividends and buy back shares, saying he preferred to hold onto the money for possible acquisitions or other investments.
Apple said that it would pay a quarterly dividend of $2.65 a share beginning in its fiscal fourth quarter, which starts July 1, and that its board had authorized a $10 billion share buyback starting Sept. 30. In all, Apple expects to spend about $45 billion over three years on the plan, all of the money from cash generated by its United States sales.
In a conference call with Wall Street analysts to announce the plan, Mr. Cook spent much of the time reassuring his audience that Apple's top priority for its cash remained keeping the ability to finance its innovations. He said Apple still had a pipeline of strong products.
''Simply stated we don't see a ceiling to our opportunities,'' said Mr. Cook. He added later that returning some of its cash to shareholders ''will not close any doors for us.''
Analysts generally agreed, saying that while the plan would slow the growth of Apple's cash hoard, it would not reverse it. Even with the dividends and stock buybacks, analysts estimate that Apple's total cash balance would grow by more than $30 billion a year in the near term because of how much new cash it takes in from its business.
By the close of Apple's next fiscal year, which will end in September 2013, Apple could have around $180 billion in cash, after dividends and buybacks, estimated Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. He also estimated that Apple would report net income of $41.2 billion for the current fiscal year.
Apple executives said the plan would make it among the top dividend payers in the nation, but the amount is still small relative to its share price, amounting to a 1.8 percent annual yield on Apple's stock.
That places Apple at the low end of its peers in the technology world, said Mike Abramsky, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets,. In comparison, he said, Microsoft pays a 2.5 percent dividend, Intel pays a 3 percent dividend and Hewlett-Packard pays a 2 percent dividend.
In a research note, A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst with Bernstein Research, expressed disappointment with the size of Apple's dividend, calling it a ''pretty vanilla return of cash program.'' Other investors said they thought Apple had done a good job of balancing competing concerns with the size of the dividend.
''It's not too piddling, and on the other hand not so large to signal that growth prospects aren't what they thought,'' said David A. Rolfe, chief investment officer of Wedgewood Partners, a money management firm whose largest holding is Apple.
Shares of Apple rose 2.65 percent, or $15.53, to $601.10 Monday.
Apple's shares were already widely held, but the decision to pay a dividend might spread them around even more. Every large fund family, from Fidelity to Vanguard, has ''income-oriented funds'' that will now be able to buy Apple shares, said Bill Choi, a managing director for Janney Montgomery Scott. ''It is one high-quality name that they can own,'' Mr. Choi said.
Mr. Jobs's resistance to paying dividends was hardly unique in Silicon Valley. Even other dividend-paying technology companies like Cisco, Oracle and Microsoft are still among the biggest cash hoarders. Google, which does not yet pay a dividend, is in the club, too.
''There is a psychology in Silicon Valley where senior management likes to have a lot of cash on hand,'' said David B. Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School. ''Every financial economist would tell you it's silly.''
Professor Yoffie said the mentality stems partly from the ''near-death experiences'' that some pioneers in technology have undergone, Apple included. When Mr. Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, it was near bankruptcy. Apple stopped paying dividends to its shareholders in December 1995, when its cash reserves were dwindling.
Earlier this year, Mr. Cook announced that Apple's board was actively discussing what to do with the company's cash. While the bulk of $45 billion it expects to spend will go to its dividend, Apple said its share repurchase would account for $10 billion of that figure over three years. Its primary purpose will be to eliminate the shareholder dilution that will occur from future Apple employee equity grants and stock purchase programs.
Apple said it would not finance the dividends and buybacks using any of the cash generated by overseas sales, which currently account for about two-thirds of its total cash balance. To bring that cash back to the United States, Apple would have to pay hefty repatriation taxes, very likely more than 30 percent.
The amount of money held overseas is likely to become a bigger part of its cash balance in the future as more of its sales shift to developing markets like China. Apple told Congress that current tax laws discourage United States companies from bringing foreign-held cash back home.

HEADLINE: U.S. Profits From the Sale Of Some Mortgage Securities

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department announced on Monday that it had finished selling the $225 billion in mortgage-backed securities it bought to help stabilize the markets during the worst of the financial crisis. 
The government ended up making a $25 billion profit on the securities, which are guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-owned mortgage finance companies. The profit came from interest payments, principal and rising prices for the securities, the department said.
''The successful sale of these securities marks another important milestone in the wind-down of the government's emergency financial crisis response efforts,'' Mary Miller, assistant secretary for financial markets, said in a statement. ''This program helped support the housing market during a critical moment for our nation's economy and delivered a substantial profit for taxpayers.''
Treasury bought $225 billion in mortgage-backed securities in 2008 and 2009 as part of a wide-ranging effort to stabilize the housing and financial markets, an effort started by the Bush administration and continued and amplified under President Obama.
In March 2011, the Treasury Department announced that it would start to sell off what remained of its portfolio. To avoid disturbing the still-fragile housing finance market, it limited sales to $10 billion a month, and said it would discontinue the sell-off if any market disturbances occurred.
Thus far, Treasury's sale of its mortgage-backed securities portfolio has provided a lucrative return to the taxpayer. But it is only one piece of a broad and expensive effort to prevent the collapse of the financial system and housing market.
The government also put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under federal conservatorship in 2008, and the taxpayer has spent about $150 billion bailing out the two government-sponsored enterprises.
Estimates vary, but the Federal Housing Finance Agency projects the ultimate cost to the taxpayer for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could be $121 billion to $193 billion, depending on the strength of the housing market and other variables.
Treasury also spent about $414 billion to buy bad assets and restore confidence in American financial institutions via the Troubled Asset Relief Program, also known as TARP. That program, though much hated by the public, has received significant revenue from its sale of stakes in participating institutions and from interest payments. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office expects it to ultimately cost taxpayers about $34 billion.
The Federal Reserve also initiated significant purchases to prop up the financial markets in the wake of the crisis. According to its most recent release, the Federal Reserve still has about $850 billion in mortgage debt on its books, along with about $1.7 trillion in Treasury debt. The Federal Reserve delivered $78.4 billion of earnings on its portfolio to the Treasury in 2010, and $76.9 billion in 2011.
In recent months, investors have tentatively returned to buying mortgage-backed debt. The housing market seems to be strengthening as well. In a monthly report released on Monday, Fannie Mae economists cited a stronger labor market and other improving indicators as hopeful signs that 2012 might be the start of a housing turnaround.
But, it noted, ''while mortgage rates have hovered near their record lows, purchase mortgage applications have remained at depressed levels,'' indicating that there remained significant weakness.

PERSON: John Cowles Jr. 

HEADLINE: John Cowles Jr., 82, Dies; Led Minneapolis Newspapers

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
John Cowles Jr., a Minneapolis newspaper executive and philanthropist whose support for arts, sports and entertainment helped elevate the Twin Cities' cultural community to national prominence, died on Saturday at home in Minneapolis. He was 82.
The cause was lung cancer, his son Jay said.
Scion of a family that owned The Des Moines Register, started Look magazine and came to dominate the newspaper business in Minneapolis for more than half a century, Mr. Cowles (rhymes with bowls) succeeded his father in 1961 as the editor of two Minneapolis papers, the morning Tribune and the evening Star. He became president and chief executive of The Minneapolis Star and Tribune Company (later renamed Cowles Media Company) in 1968. 
His tenure was rocky, but during it the papers won praise for aggressive local reporting, increased arts and science coverage and support for the civil rights movement and the Equal Rights Amendment in editorials. (Though he was generally described as a progressive liberal, Mr. Cowles served on a White House committee in 1965 to generate support for President Johnson's war policies.)
The company's fortunes declined in the late 1960s, however, after several unsuccessful acquisitions, including Harper's magazine and the publisher Harper & Row. In 1979, The Star and Tribune Company bought The Buffalo Courier-Express but was forced to close it three years later.
In 1982, the company merged The Star and The Tribune and cut its work force, prompting the editor of the merged papers to quit in protest. Mr. Cowles subsequently fired the publisher and assumed the role himself. But just a few months later, in early 1983, the board of Cowles Media, which included his sister and two cousins, dismissed him as publisher and head of the company as well.
He remained on the board until 1984 and into the 1990s continued to control a substantial percentage of company stock through his management of a family trust. Cowles Media was sold to the McClatchy Company in 1998.
Beyond his turbulent stewardship of the newspapers, Mr. Cowles was known in Minneapolis and St. Paul for his philanthropy and his belief that arts institutions and sports teams were necessary for cities to grow and thrive. In 1960, he served on a steering committee -- and by most accounts was its leading voice -- that persuaded the British director Tyrone Guthrie to establish a resident theater company in Minneapolis to perform classic works in repertory. He then helped raise $2.2 million, and the Guthrie Theater opened in 1963 with a production of ''Hamlet.'' It became a model for nonprofit theaters across the country. Four decades later, he was co-chairman of the architecture committee for the new Guthrie Theater that opened in 2006.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Mr. Cowles was active in the construction of the Metrodome, a state-financed domed stadium in downtown Minneapolis for the city's two major sports franchises, the Minnesota Twins and the Minnesota Vikings.
His position on the project was controversial. Opponents, including staff members at The Minneapolis Tribune, thought it was a clear conflict of interest for the owner of a newspaper to take a public position on an important local issue it was covering. In 1979, staff members placed an ad in their own paper disassociating themselves from the company's involvement.
The Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome opened in 1982; the Twins have since moved to Target Field.
Mr. Cowles said in a 2010 interview that the impetus for his support of the Guthrie and the Metrodome were the same.
''Strengthening the cultural organization and life of the Twin Cities was not only going to make life more interesting and attractive for our families,'' he said, ''but was going to attract business and keep business here in town, and it was going to be just plain good business.''
Mr. Cowles was born on May 27, 1929, in Des Moines, Iowa, where his grandfather, Gardner Cowles, had been publisher of The Des Moines Register since 1903. His father, John, and his uncle Gardner Cowles Jr., known as Mike, founded Look magazine. John Cowles Sr. bought The Minneapolis Star in 1935 and moved his family to Minneapolis in 1938.
The next year, the family business bought The Minneapolis Journal and merged it with The Star, and then added The Minneapolis Tribune in 1941. Young John graduated from the Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and Harvard, and spent two years in the Army before joining the family business as a reporter.
After his dismissal from the company in 1983, Mr. Cowles began a somewhat eclectic career. He studied agricultural economics, taught aerobics, toured in the United States and Europe with a modern dance company, and helped establish a women's professional fast-pitch softball league. He also continued his arts philanthropy around the Twin Cities; most recently, the Cowles Center, a theater devoted to dance, opened in Minneapolis last fall.
Besides his son John III, known as Jay, Mr. Cowles is survived by his wife, the former Jane Sage Fuller, who is known as Sage Fuller Cowles and whom he married in 1952; another son, Charles; a daughter, Jane Sage Cowles; a sister, Sarah Cowles Doering; a brother, Russell; 10 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Insurer Is Said to Forgo Bonuses Under Pressure

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
MBIA did not award bonuses to its top executives in 2011, but only after its regulator pressured the beleaguered bond insurer to withhold the payouts, people briefed on the matter said.
Jay Brown, the company's chief executive, and three other senior executives, did not receive any cash bonus or long-term stock awards for 2011, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.
The decision by the company followed discussions with its primary regulator, the New York State Department of Financial Services. Mr. Brown and his colleagues concluded that ''it was in the best interest'' of the company not to take any bonuses. 
Benjamin M. Lawsky, the head of the department, told the company that bonuses were inappropriate given the state's assistance provided to the company during the financial crisis, these people said.
A spokesman for MBIA declined to comment.
The clash over MBIA's bonuses - or lack thereof - is the latest dust-up in the debate over the government's role in regulating executive compensation, especially at companies that received assistance from the government during the crisis. Lawmakers and regulators have sought to rein in compensation at financial firms, blaming large incentive-based pay packages for the questionable risk-tasking during the market boom.
Earlier this month, the regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac slashed salaries for the heads of the two agencies and blocked most executives' bonuses. Both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have floated proposals that would give them more oversight over compensation at financial firms.
In New York, the state attorney's general's office, where Mr. Lawsky served as a special assistant, has also played a role in scrutinizing bonuses paid by companies that received bailout money.
Some compensation experts have criticized the regulators for insinuating themselves into compensation decisions rather them leave them to a company's board and its shareholders.
''It's a messy situation,'' said Alan Johnson of Johnson Associates, which advises companies on their pay plans. ''I'm not saying that the government has no role here, but these decisions can often appear haphazard and politically driven.''
New York's clash with MBIA has its origins in 2009, when the insurance division of the state's financial services department effectively rescued the company. The department authorized a split of MBIA into two operations, separating its traditional municipal bond insurance business from its crippling exposure to toxic mortgage-backed securities.
MBIA, which is based in Armonk, N.Y., has been mired in litigation ever since that controversial restructuring. A group of banks sued the insurer, accusing it of fraud when it restructured. MBIA has also filed several lawsuits, including an action against Bank of America and its Countrywide unit, claiming that they lied to MBIA about the quality of the mortgages that were bundled into securities that the company insured.
New York's financial services department has helped broker settlements with some of the banks that sued MBIA, including a pact with Morgan Stanley in which the bank received a $1.1 payment from the insurer.
The department began reviewing the bonus issue while engaged in those settlement discussions, say people familiar with the matter. Mr. Lawsky took the view that the state's approval of MBIA's split, and the department's work to protect the insurer's policyholders, was not meant to enrich company management, these people said.
Executives at MBIA were paid bonuses in 2009 and 2010, according to securities filings. Mr. Brown, the chief executive, received $1.8 million last year as part of a non-equity incentive plan, and about $4.5 million in awards and incentive payments the year before.
MBIA initially resisted the state's recommendation to abandon bonuses, but eventually capitulated, these people said. But in Monday's securities filing, MBIA hinted at its disappointment with the state's interference with how much it paid its executives.
The decision to withhold bonuses, said the company, ''introduces the risk that our compensation program will no longer be effective in meeting our objectives'' of attracting and retaining employees.
MBIA added that while the board's compensation committee supported the executives' decision, ''this was not a reflection of the compensation's committee's views of their individual performances for 2011.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Strained by Sanctions, Iran Eases Money Policy

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
Pressured by tightened Western economic sanctions and a burgeoning black market for dollars, with Iranian citizens desperate to buy them, Iran's central bank has loosened its strict foreign exchange policy, allowing money traders there to sell dollars for rials at the unofficial market rate, rather than the artificially fixed official rate.
Few Iranian money changers had been willing to sell dollars at the official rate, 12,260 rials to the dollar, because it was unprofitable for them. 
The glaring absence had caused a surge in illicit money changing in Iran, in which buyers who needed dollars were willing to pay ever-increasing numbers of rials for them, pushing the unofficial market rate to about 19,000 rials to the dollar.
Economists said the eased exchange rate restriction, which was announced on Sunday, appeared to be a bow to reality.
''It was extremely difficult to outlaw a market that the people desperately need,'' said Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, an Iranian economics professor who teaches at Virginia Tech and has followed the foreign exchange problems confronting Iran. ''Iranians were doing this outside the formal market, so letting it become formal was logical.''
Dollars and precious metals like gold are coveted in Iran because they have proved to be an effective hedge against the rial's weakness from worsening inflation, estimated to be more than 20 percent a year.
Dollars are also in high demand in Iran because they are needed for travel abroad and for other foreign expenses like overseas college tuition. The appetite for dollars in Iran has put even more pressure on the rial, which has lost about half of its value in the past year.
Economists said the eased exchange rate restriction, which now simply requires money changers to report the rate at which they sell dollars for rials, would provide the central bank with more precise information about the domestic demand for dollars and enable it to track the disparity between the official rate and the market rate more accurately.
The official rate was designed in part to prevent a flight of capital from the country.
But the eased policy creates new risks for Iran's government by raising the likelihood of such a capital flight, as Iran's economic isolation increases because of the sanctions imposed by Western powers in response to its disputed nuclear energy program.
The sanctions have targeted the banking and oil sectors of Iran's economy and have made it increasingly difficult for Iranian companies to import needed goods and conduct business abroad.
The sanctions are expected to intensify further in coming months, as the European Union imposes a boycott of Iranian oil starting on July 1 and the United States enforces a new law that can penalize any foreign company that does business with Iran's central bank by denying that company access to the American market.
The eased policy on currency trading also appeared to be one of the central bank's first public responses to its expulsion from a global telecommunications network of banks that took effect on Saturday, part of the tightening vise of sanctions.
The expulsion from the network, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, severed an important link between international financial markets and up to 30 Iranian financial institutions, including the central bank.
Iranian leaders have denounced the sanctions and vowed to find ways to bypass their effects. The Iranians have negotiated barter deals with Russia and India to avoid spending dollars and other foreign currencies, for example.
Reuters reported Monday that Pakistan had decided to export one million tons of wheat to Iran in a barter arrangement, possibly in exchange for Iranian iron ore.

HEADLINE: Mets and Picard Become Unlikely Allies

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Richard Sandomir contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The settlement between the owners of the Mets and the trustee representing the victims of the fraud orchestrated by Bernard L. Madoff ends a rancorous legal fight between two parties that were willing to dig in their heels and openly point fingers.
But in a twist, the former adversaries are now on the same side. That is because the settlement calls for Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, the Mets' owners, to receive $178 million from the trustee for money they lost in some of their Madoff accounts. That money will be used to pay back the trustee to cover the $162 million in fictitious profits that Wilpon and Katz received in other accounts. 
In essence, Wilpon and Katz need the trustee to recoup as much money as he can from so-called net winners and distribute it to net losers like themselves.
''In a sense, we're now partners,'' said David J. Sheehan, the chief counsel for Irving H. Picard, the trustee. ''They have an interest in us getting 100 percent recovery and they should be supportive, and we will be supportive by trying to collect all those funds.''
The favorable settlement for Wilpon and Katz, though, will do little to immediately improve the fortunes of their largest asset, the Mets. The team lost $121 million the last two years and after slashing their player payroll by about $50 million this season and letting their best player, Jose Reyes, leave, the prospects for a quick turnaround on the field appear slim.
They owe about $400 million to a syndicate of banks. Finances were so tight that in November, the Mets laid off nearly 10 percent of their 180 front office employees. Those money pressures are not likely to disappear overnight.
''They're basically in the same position they were in even though the Madoff ruling is a net neutral to them,'' said Rob Tilliss, a partner at Inner Circle Sports, a sports advisory firm. ''And if they have a slow start to the season, it could be even worse for them.''
Still, with the threat of having to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties and legal fees now gone, the Mets may be better able to persuade fans to return the stadium. Wilpon, speaking outside the federal courthouse in downtown Manhattan after Monday's settlement was announced, promised to ''bring the Mets back to the prominence our fans deserve and the city of New York deserves.'' He asked fans to ''stick with us.''
With the Madoff case now behind them, the Mets appear to have sold all 12 minority stakes in the club for $20 million each that they have been marketing since September. Only five of the shares were purchased by outsiders; the Wilpon and Katz families bought three of the shares, and the two cable companies that own part of SNY, the Mets' cable network, bought four others.
Still, the Mets are expected to announce as soon as Tuesday that they have repaid the $25 million they borrowed from Major League Baseball as well as a $40 million loan from the Bank of America, according to two people familiar with the team's finances.
But how long fans may have to wait for signs that the Mets are finally clear of their woes remains to be seen. After all, the pressures that forced the Mets to seek new loans and new partners, and to slash the club's payroll, all arose without one penny having been paid to the trustee.
Instead, the Mets found themselves under siege from a troubled economy, poor play on the field, a disgruntled fan base buying fewer tickets and the cessation of the robust, and fraudulent, returns they were getting on their Madoff investments. In effect, most of those issues still remain.
One of the most vexing is attendance, which fell again in 2011, even though the Mets have cut ticket prices several times in recent years. And in a bit of unfortunate timing, the three-year contracts for some of the luxury suites at Citi Field are up for renewal amid the negative environment in which the Mets have been forced to operate.
Those suites go for as much as $500,000 a season, significant money for the Mets, but what the renewal rate is at this point is not known. Money from the suite rentals, as well as revenue from concessions, parking and other sources, helps pay off the $695 million in bonds that were issued to cover the cost of building Citi Field.
In December, Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, changed its near-term outlook on those bonds from stable to negative.
In its report, S.&P. said that overall revenue for the Mets fell 12 percent in 2011, led by a 22 percent drop in revenue from club seats and suites. Revenue from merchandise, food and beverages fell 20 percent last season, the report added.
Ultimately, the Mets have to put a better product on the field to win back fans, but when that will happen is anyone's guess.
The Mets, though, will no longer have to wrestle with the possibility of sizable damages from the Madoff case.
''Change doesn't happen instantly,'' said Vince Gennaro, a consultant to several major league teams and the author of ''Diamond Dollars: The Economics of Winning in Baseball.''
''The financial uncertainty has been eliminated so you have some good sense about clarity around the future,'' he added. As for 2012, he said, do not expect much. ''Wait till next year'' was the old rallying cry in Brooklyn. Now it might be the new one in Queens.

HEADLINE: Senate Seeks to Toughen a Bill Aimed at Start-Ups

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A decade after the dot-com bubble popped and Enron became synonymous with spectacular fraud, Congress is on the verge of scrapping numerous safeguards against investment fraud and allowing some small companies to sell stock to the public with minimal disclosure or oversight.
The bill, which intends to make it easier for emerging companies to raise money and court investors, is scheduled for several procedural votes in the Senate on Tuesday and could come to a final vote as early as this week. A Senate amendment that differs substantially from a bipartisan version passed overwhelmingly by the House two weeks ago, faces a difficult hurdle. 
The amendment must get 60 votes on Tuesday to revise the House bill, and it is unclear that Democrats will be able to attract enough Republican votes.
The JOBS Act, whose acronym stands for Jump-start Our Business Start-ups, has attracted widespread support on Capitol Hill and from the White House for its promise of attracting small-business investment and allowing businesses to hire workers. That it would give legislators something positive to take home to constituents during election season is a bonus.
But the bill faces stiff opposition from, among others, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, pension funds and lobbying groups like the American Association of Retired Persons, which fear that the bill will revive some of the worst practices of the dot-com era.
''Too often, investors are the target of fraudulent schemes disguised as investment opportunities,'' Mary L. Schapiro, the S.E.C. chairwoman, wrote in a March 13 letter to the Senate banking committee. ''As you know, if the balance is tipped to the point where investors are not confident that there are appropriate protections, investors will lose confidence in our markets, and capital formation will ultimately be made more difficult and expensive.''
House Republicans say that their bill offers plenty of protection. The House Financial Services Committee, which advanced the bill, issued a statement on Monday noting that a witness chosen by Democrats ''said the bill would increase investor protections and access to information.''
A move in the Senate to amend substantial portions of a bill that evolved over several months in the House are little more than an attempt to kill the bill, said Representative Spencer Bachus, the Alabama Republican who is chairman of the House committee. He added that the Senate was ''acting like Lucy snatching the football away at the last possible moment, and it is the entrepreneurs and job-creators who are made to play Charlie Brown.''
The bill does include some curious elements, beginning with its definition of an ''emerging business'' as one with annual revenue of up to $1 billion or has no more than $700 million in publicly held stock. At an S.E.C. forum in 2010 on small-business capital formation, one of the top recommendations from small-business experts was to set a limit of $250 million in public stock for companies to qualify for small-business exemptions from many securities regulations. A Senate amendment sponsored by Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, would set the limit at $350 million of annual revenue.
The House bill would also require an emerging growth company to file no more than two years of financial statements before it sold shares to the public and would exempt those companies from hiring an independent auditor to assess its internal controls.
The measure also would throw out restrictions on financial analysts taking part in a Wall Street firm's attempt to win the business of underwriting a company's stock offering. Those rules grew out of the dot-com bubble, when analysts publicly promoted the stocks of a firm's investment banking clients, sometimes even while disparaging the stocks privately.
Even the United States Chamber of Commerce, which has strongly supported the House bill, said in a letter to the House Financial Services Committee last month that ''there may be a blurring of boundaries that could create potential conflicts of interests between the research and investment components of broker-dealers.''
The White House, with its own needs to chalk up job-growth programs before the election, issued a ''statement of administration policy'' this month supporting the House bill and noting that President Obama ''called for cutting the red tape that prevents many rapidly growing start-up companies from raising needed capital,'' while also providing for ''appropriate investor protections.''
Subsequently, the White House issued another statement saying it supported Senate amendments to the House bill on investor protection. ''The president strongly supports the efforts of Senate Democrats to find common ground by supporting the most effective aspects of the House bill to increase capital formation for growing businesses while also improving the House bill to ensure there are sufficient safeguards to prevent abuse and protect investors,'' it said.
The Senate this week plans to consider another amendment to the House JOBS bill that would finance the Export-Import Bank through 2015 and increase its loan limit to $140 billion from $100 billion currently, an amount that the bank estimates it will reach in a few months. The House bill did not include any such measure, and House Republicans have said they oppose tacking the Export-Import amendment onto their work.

HEADLINE: Before Games, Workers Win A Big Event

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com; Twitter: @powellnyt

 BODY:
LONDON -- Enveloped in a warm, glimmering haze, the Olympic Stadium looks like a vast, silvery spaceship come to unlikely rest in the working-class East End.
Our viewing platform is no less unlikely. I'm standing with Lina Jamoul, a community organizer, at the top of a giant new shopping mall. It feels as though someone in Santa Monica should file a claim for grand-theft mall. Brutal, despairing riots swept across the ancient working-class neighborhoods near here less than a year ago, and vast public dollars devoted to sport could appear grotesque.
Except that Ms. Jamoul and her fellow thousands with the East London Communities Organization have turned these games into a triumph. In a few months, as tourists descend on these neighborhoods, every Briton working inside the Olympic perimeter, including tea fetchers and souvenir shop workers, will make wages worth about $4 an hour above this country's minimum wage. 
It is the world's first Living Wage Olympics.
And after the games end, an Olympic corporation will produce housing, with perhaps 2,000 homes -- 2,012 is what East London has in mind -- set aside for working-class Londoners.
None of this was a given. Were the negotiations with Olympic officials tense? Ms. Jamoul smiles. ''They said they had obligations to their contractors.'' She pauses. ''We said what you have is a bureaucracy. That isn't our problem.''
We yap of globalization but often assume we live in sui generis worlds. What works here could not work there.
But Britain and the United States, and London and New York, are worlds converging.
Unemployment runs at near 9 percent; the term here is ''redundant.''
London, a 2010 book stated, was the world's most unequal city, and New York was not far behind. The very wealthy pursue their Oxbridge degrees, their for-fee schools and gated societies. For a New Yorker to stand outside a white-washed town house in Notting Hill, and watch Eastern European nannies herd children to waiting Range Rovers, is to feel utter familiarity.
The richest tenth of the population here, according to a professor at Sheffield University, has amassed 273 times the wealth of the bottom tenth. As a tart-tongued Guardian columnist put it last week, London feels in ''transition to a full-blown creep haven.''
That's well overdone. There is a more complicated beast that breathes beneath the gilded skin of this city, and our own for that matter.
In New York, activists and the City Council recently cobbled together a proposal in which a few thousand workers would get a few more dollars an hour if they worked on certain tax-subsidized projects.
East London shot off a more vibrant flare, thanks to fierce organizing and a mayor not so trapped by his own free-market assumptions as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is.
A DECADE ago, when London began its Olympic bid, most residents of East London -- a polyglot place of whites, Bangladeshis, Arabs and Africans -- spoke of the games as a bloody headache.
Years earlier, the government had sluiced millions in subsidies into Canary Wharf, a new financial district there. Officials promised jobs for local lads and lasses, but most of those became minimum-wage positions.
Then Neil Jameson, an organizer with London Citizens, trained years ago in Brooklyn by the Industrial Areas Foundation, recalled thinking: ''Hang on, everything is an organizing opportunity. What if we had construction training and living wages?''
The group offered the Olympics a suffocating embrace.
Nuns showed up on Oxford Street holding candles. Abdul Khaliq Durrant, a building cleaner, out-organized the banks and forced them to make contractors pay cleaners a living wage.
Then Mr. Durrant looked to the Olympics. They held an Olympic ''celebration'' and invited the Olympic chief. ''He said, 'Oh, right, of course I'll be at your ''celebration,'' ' '' Mr. Jameson said.
The meeting was, in fact, a trap, and the organizers extracted more concessions. You say wages are beyond your control, they said to the Olympic officials. Pity. Just make it happen. ''It was,'' Mr. Jameson said, ''all very tense.''
London Citizens, which is affiliated with the East London Communities Organization, is an organization that does not get hung up on ideology. The former Labor mayor was a supporter, as is the current Tory mayor.
Just before the International Olympic Committee announced its decision, the community organizers gathered 100 East Londoners and trooped off to Trafalgar Square for the announcement.
''We shouted louder than anyone when it happened, because it was our deal,'' Ms. Jamoul said. ''Democracy and politics really do work -- if you're organized.''

HEADLINE: For 2nd Year, A Sharp Drop In Law School Entrance Tests

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
Legal diplomas are apparently losing luster.
The organization behind the Law School Admission Test reported that the number of tests it administered this year dropped by more than 16 percent, the largest decline in more than a decade.
The Law School Admission Council reported that the LSAT was given 129,925 times in the 2011-12 academic year. That was well off the 155,050 of the year before and far from the peak of 171,514 in the year before that. In all, the number of test takers has fallen by nearly 25 percent in the last two years.
The decline reflects a spreading view that the legal market in the United States is in terrible shape and will have a hard time absorbing the roughly 45,000 students who are expected to graduate from law school in each of the next three years. And the problem may be deep and systemic. 
Many lawyers and law professors have argued in recent years that the legal market will either stagnate or shrink as technology allows more low-end legal work to be handled overseas, and as corporations demand more cost-efficient fee arrangements from their firms.
That argument, and news that so many new lawyers are struggling with immense debt, is changing the way law school is perceived by undergrads. Word is getting through that law school is no longer a safe place to sit out an economic downturn -- an article of faith for years -- and that strong grades at an above-average school no longer guarantees a six-figure law firm job.
''For a long time there has been this culturally embedded perception that if you go to law school, it will be worth the money,'' said Kyle McEntee of Law School Transparency, a legal education policy organization. ''The idea that law school is an easy ticket to financial security is finally breaking down.''
Law schools have also suffered through some withering press in the last couple of years. Some blogs, most of them written by unemployed or underemployed graduates, have accused law schools of enticing students with shady data. Attention has focused on a crucial statistic: the percentage of graduates who are employed nine months after graduation.
In recent months, class-action lawsuits have been filed against more than a dozen law schools, charging that students were snookered into enrolling by postgraduate employment figures that were vastly, and fraudulently, inflated. Even if law schools are able to defeat these lawsuits -- and many legal scholars anticipate they will -- the media attention has been bruising. Steve Schwartz, an LSAT tutor, said the new LSAT figures were not a surprise, given the steady decline in the number of students seeking one-on-one tutoring.
''This is a major turn of events,'' he wrote of the newly reported test numbers on his LSAT Blog, ''The tide is turning, folks.''
For some law schools, the dwindling number of test-takers represents a serious long-term challenge.
''What I'd anticipate is that you'll see the biggest falloff in applications in the bottom end of the law school food chain,'' said Andrew Morriss of the University of Alabama School of Law. ''Those schools are going to have significant difficulty because they are dependent on tuition to fund themselves and they'll either have to cut class size to maintain standards, or accept students with lower credentials.''
If they take the second course, Mr. Morriss said, it would hurt the school three years later because there is a strong correlation between poor performance on the LSAT and poor performance on the bar exam. If students start failing the bar, then the prestige of the school will drop, which would mean lowering standards even more. ''At that point,'' Mr. Morriss said, ''the school is risking a death spiral.''

HEADLINE: Apple Elevates Markets, Especially the S.&P. 500

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's 500 advanced on Monday to the highest level since May 2008 as Apple said it would pay a dividend and buy back $10 billion of its stock.
Interest rates continued to climb as the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell for a ninth consecutive session, the longest stretch since June 2006.
Yields on the 10-year note reached the highest since October after the Federal Reserve raised its assessment of the economy last week, driving investors to riskier assets like equities, and reducing speculation that the Fed would make additional asset purchases known as quantitative easing. 
''It feels like continued liquidation,'' Brian Edmonds, head of interest rates at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York, said. ''We've seen a dramatic move in a quick period of time.''
The note fell 21/32, to 96 23/32, and the yield rose to 2.38 percent from 2.30 percent late Friday. The yield is up from 1.97 percent at the start of the month and 1.75 percent on Oct. 1.
Apple climbed 2.7 percent Monday to a record $601.10. Citigroup advanced 1.3 percent after selling its 2.71 percent stake in the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. U.S. Steel rallied 6.4 percent to pace gains in commodity shares. United Parcel Service increased 3.4 percent after agreeing to buy TNT Express.
Bank of America retreated 2.8 percent, reversing an earlier advance that drove the stock above $10. The KBW Bank Index, however, added 0.5 percent as 20 of its 24 stocks advanced.
The S.& P. 500-stock index rose 5.58 points, or 0.40 percent to 1,409.75, ending 9.9 percent below its October 2007 record of 1,565.15. The Dow Jones industrial average added 6.51 points, or 0.05 percent, to 13,239.13. The Nasdaq composite index gained 23.06 points, or 0.75 percent to 3,078.32, the highest level since November 2000.
''There's plenty of room for dividends to increase,'' Paul Zemsky, the New York-based head of asset allocation for ING Investment Management, said. ''Paying dividends is a sign of health in the companies and the economy. That plays well in terms of investors' confidence.''
The S.& P. 500 has rallied 12 percent this year and is on pace for the best first quarter since 1998 amid better-than-estimated economic and corporate reports. It trades at about 14.6 times reported earnings, the highest valuation level since July, though still below the average since 1954 of 16.4 times earnings.
Apple investors will receive a quarterly dividend of $2.65 a share starting in the period beginning July 1, Apple said. The buybacks will begin in the fiscal year starting Sept. 30 and will take place over three years, the company said.
The company's cash has swelled amid surging demand for its products. Investors had urged Apple to return some of the balance in the form of a dividend.
A measure of home builders in S.& P. indexes dropped 0.9 percent. The March reading of 28 in the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market index came after a February figure that was lower than initially reported, figures from the group showed Monday. The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for the home builders' index rise to 30. Readings below 50 mean more respondents said conditions were poor.
KB Home sank 6.8 percent to $11.89. PulteGroup retreated 1.4 percent to $9.16.

HEADLINE: Yemeni Official Puts the Toll From the Year-Old Uprising at 'Over 2,000 Martyrs'

BYLINE: By LAURA KASINOF

 BODY:
At least 2,000 Yemenis were killed during the year of political unrest after popular protests broke out seeking the ouster of the entrenched authoritarian president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen's minister of human rights announced in a speech to the United Nations. 
The total far exceeded estimates by human rights groups that said government forces had killed 200 protesters. It was not clear, however, whether the latest number included soldiers killed. Nor did the minister, Horeya Mashour, specify if her figure referred to civilians killed in fighting between the military and Al Qaeda militants in Yemen's south.
''Despite the commitment of the peaceful revolution, unfortunately there were scenes of violence and armed clashes, and serious violation of human rights occurred,'' Ms. Mashour said at the United Nations Human Rights Committee session in New York last week.
''Many victims died, and according to initial reports, they are numbered to be over 2,000 martyrs, including 143 children and 20 women,'' Ms. Mashour continued, according to the official statement published by Yemen's official Saba news agency.
Yemen was caught up in the uprising that swept the Arab world as popular discontent with authoritarian leaders and stagnant economies led to massive street protests that toppled regimes. The protesters in Yemen were largely peaceful even after government forces opened fire on them. That led to a split in the military, which promoted a general to side -- and fight -- with the demonstrators in Sana, the capital. In other places, like the central city of Taiz, residents rose up to defend themselves and fought back.
The tally of dead steadily climbed.
The fighting, and killing, slowed in November when Mr. Saleh signed an internationally brokered deal to hand power to his deputy, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Mr. Hadi was confirmed as president in a one-candidate vote largely embraced by Yemenis who saw the transfer as a chance for a new start. The crisis made life in the impoverished nation even harder as prices for basic goods soared and public services like electricity ground to a halt.
Now Mr. Hadi faces the formidable challenge of patching together a nation that was showing signs of failure even before the uprising. Militants aligned with Al Qaeda control large parts of the country's southeast, where they act as the de facto government and have become increasingly bold in their attacks against government forces. The armed forces remain divided, with relatives of Mr. Saleh still controlling powerful divisions and the rebel military commander, Maj. Gen. Ali Mohsin al-Ahmar, controlling another. Though General Ahmar vowed publicly that he would step down as soon as Mr. Saleh did, he has yet to fulfill his promise, and his soldiers remain positioned in the northwestern quarter of Sana around his army base.

 BODY:
EXCLUSIVE TALKS Viterra, the Canadian grain marketing and shipping company, run by Mayo Schmidt, left, confirmed on Monday that it was in ''exclusive negotiations'' with a potential buyer. 
It did not name the likely purchaser, but speculation points to Glencore International, the large Swiss commodities trading company, in a consortium with two Canadian firms. IAN AUSTEN
ORDERLY SETTLEMENT The payout on credit-default swaps linked to Greece's government bonds was decided on Monday, resolving one of the crucial subplots of the European debt crisis.
Using the swaps, investors were able to buy or sell insurance against a Greek default, which occurred this month when the country restructured its debt. An auction in London determined that investors who had bought protection with the swaps would effectively get a payment equivalent to 78.5 percent of the original value of Greece's bonds. PETER EAVIS
HANDLING CONFLICTS Conflicts of interest have become a hot topic on Wall Street, particularly at Goldman Sachs, because of a recent Delaware Chancery Court opinion and an opinion article in The New York Times by Greg Smith, a former Goldman employee.
What makes dealing with conflicts of interest different when Wall Street firms are involved is that, unlike other professions, there are no effective enforcement mechanisms to prevent them from harming investors, according to White Collar Watch. PETER J. HENNING
HUNGER FOR DATA The Zayo Group agreed on Monday to buy AboveNet, a provider of fiber optic networks for businesses, for $2.2 billion in cash to tap into demand for ever-faster data connections.

HEADLINE: Times Sq. Is Found to Light Up City Economy

BYLINE: By PATRICK MCGEEHAN

 BODY:
Times Square may be the place hardened New Yorkers go out of their way to avoid, but its importance as a magnet for commerce as well as tourists has risen rapidly in the last few years, according to a study to be released this week.
The Times Square district directly and indirectly contributes one-tenth of all of the jobs in the city and $1 of every $9 of economic activity, says the study, which was commissioned by the Times Square Alliance, the de facto chamber of commerce for the district. That amounts to $110 billion in annual economic activity - about equal to the output of Portland, Ore. - emanating from the district, which the report defines as roughly a block on each side of Broadway between 40th and 53rd Streets. 
How could so much of the economy of the nation's biggest city depend on an area that occupies less than 1 percent of its land?
Just look up, says Tim Tompkins, the president of the alliance. Not at the 230 electronic signs that have long been the hallmark of Times Square, but at the buildings that many of them adorn.
They are not just hotels, but also giant office towers that house companies where tens of thousands of lawyers, accountants, editors and bond traders work. Those companies buy goods and services from other businesses throughout the city and employ people who take their pay home to apartments and houses in other boroughs.
In all, about 170,000 people work in the district, and most of them - 61 percent - live in northern Manhattan, another borough of the city or the suburbs. The rest live in Manhattan below 110th Street. But the money earned and spent in Times Square supports 215,000 jobs elsewhere in the city, according to the study, conducted by HR&A Advisors.
''What's significant about Times Square is that it has become more diversified,'' Mr. Tompkins said. ''Certainly we've become a major commercial office district. Until I saw that we have 29 million square feet of office space, I didn't realize just how much. Before, we were an entertainment and hotel district.''
Of course, the Times Square area has been cleaning up its act for much of the last two decades. But Mr. Tompkins said the study showed that the transformation was nearly complete. In addition, he said, it proves the value of tourism as a main component of the city's strategy to develop its economy.
''In the same way that we were a postcard for why not to come to New York City 20 or maybe 30 years ago,'' Mr. Tompkins said, ''we are a powerful advertisement for how appealing the city is now.''
Rosemary Scanlon, an economist who has lived in the city since 1969, said the numbers seemed plausible because the area was filled with tourists. Ms. Scanlon, the interim dean of the Schack Institute of Real Estate of New York University two blocks from Times Square, said that earlier studies had shown that people who came to the city for Broadway shows and museums stayed two nights or more, on average, and spent significant sums while in the city.
She said the effects of the transformative power of redevelopment may be most visible west of Times Square, where Larry Silverstein and other developers have built luxury apartment towers in places where no market for them previously existed. (The study gives Times Square credit for spawning all of that construction.)
But the most convincing evidence Ms. Scanlon offered was the newfound respect paid by New Yorkers. ''I'm hearing people saying, I know this sounds nuts, but I had some out-of-town visitors and I took them to Times Square,'' she said. ''I find myself saying, I want to walk you down there and I want you to see this.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Behind the Blood Money

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- An iPhone can do a lot of things. But can it arm Congolese rebels?
That is the question being debated by a battalion of lobbyists from electronics makers, mining companies and international aid organizations that has descended on the Securities and Exchange Commission in recent months seeking to influence the drafting of a Dodd-Frank regulation that has nothing to do with the financial crisis.
Tacked onto the end of that encyclopedic digest of financial reform is an odd provision. It requires publicly traded companies whose products use certain minerals commonly mined in strife-torn areas of Central Africa to report to shareholders and the S.E.C. whether their mineral supply comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The measure is aimed at cutting off the brutal militia groups that have often taken over the mining and sale of so-called conflict minerals to finance their military aims. Just about every company affected by the law says they support it, but many business groups have also been pushing aggressively to put wiggle room in the restrictions, calling for lengthy phase-in periods, exemptions for minimal use of the minerals and loose definitions of what types of uses are covered. 
Nearly every consumer product that includes electronic parts uses a derivative of one of the four minerals: columbite-tantalite, which when refined is used in palm-size cellphones and giant turbines; cassiterite, an important source of the tin used in coffee cans and circuit boards; wolframite, used to produce tungsten for light bulbs and machine tools; and gold, commonly used as an electronic conductor (and, of course, jewelry).
Given their broad application, the minerals have been a primary target of humanitarian groups concerned about genocide, sexual violence, child soldiers and other issues that have been common outgrowths of conflicts in Central Africa.
''We don't think you need to have people being killed in order to have these metals in our cellphones,'' said Corinna Gilfillan, who heads the United States office of Global Witness, which has worked on the issue for several years.
But manufacturers question the effectiveness -- not to mention the practicality and expense -- of tracing every scrap of refined metal back to its original hole in the ground.
''The challenge is that conflict minerals are a symptom,'' said Rick Goss, vice president for environment and sustainability at the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group. ''The entrenched powers in these countries have plenty of other means to raise money. Simply cutting off one source of revenue to a warlord or military rulers is not going to stop the genocide.''
The Dodd-Frank law on conflict minerals is already having an effect in Eastern Congo, damping or halting production at many mines even before the disclosure regulations for companies are in place.
''It is causing, I would say, a sort of embargo on traders and diggers in Eastern Congo,'' Serge Tshamala, an official at the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Congo. ''The longer it takes the S.E.C. to come up with guidelines, the worse it is for our people.'' Mr. Tshamala and other Congo government officials met with the agency's staff members in June, urging them to speed completion of the regulations.
The agency is moving slowly, however. The Dodd-Frank law set an April 2011 deadline for completion of the rules. After proposing regulations in December 2010, the agency took comments for 30 days, and received so many suggestions that it extended the period by a month.
After missing the April deadline, the agency in October conducted a roundtable for its commissioners to hear directly from manufacturers, mining companies, advocacy groups and institutional investors. This month, Mary L. Schapiro, the agency's chairwoman, said the agency hoped to complete the process ''in the next couple of months.''
The commission already has decided to include a phase-in period to allow companies time to build networks to trace their mineral supply. But an exemption for use of trace amounts of the metals is unlikely, Ms. Shapiro said.
As Bennett Freeman, a senior vice president for sustainability research and policy at Calvert Investments put it during the roundtable last year, a very small amount of gold is used as a conductor in a cellphone, ''but when one takes into account the fact that there were 1.6 billion cellphones sold globally last year, that adds up to be a very significant volume of that particular metal.''
Still undecided -- and the subject of more than 100 meetings between lobbyists and S.E.C. officials since the rule was proposed -- is just how the commission will decide who is covered by the conflict minerals requirement. The law says that the minerals must be ''necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by'' a company.
Simple as it seems, that definition gives rise to a tangle of questions. Is mining ''manufacturing''? Is a coffee can made with tin ''necessary to the functionality'' of the coffee being sold?
The hair-splitting answers to those questions will be the basis on which the law could be challenged in court, and it is that prospect that accounts for much of the agency's deliberate progress in fashioning the rules.
Administrative law requires an agency like the S.E.C. to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of rules. Last year, a federal appeals court cited insufficient cost-benefit research in striking down one of the agency's new regulations, and S.E.C. insiders say that decision has the agency operating in perpetual fear of a repeat occurrence.
There is little agreement on what it will cost companies to comply. The agency estimates companies will have to spend $71 million to comply with its regulations. The National Association of Manufacturers estimates the regulations will cost $9 billion to $16 billion.
Whatever the answer, part of the burden would fall on a given company's supply chain -- companies, that is, that are very likely not to be covered by the regulation's reporting requirements, which cover only publicly traded companies.
Irma Villarreal, chief securities counsel for Kraft Foods, said during the S.E.C. roundtable that Kraft produced 40,000 distinct products and used 100,000 suppliers, creating a Herculean task of auditing supply chains for conflict minerals.
Nonprofit groups that support the new regulation say a growing number of companies -- Intel, Motorola and Hewlett-Packard among them, according to the Enough Project, a nongovernmental organization that works against genocide and crimes against humanity -- have already made significant steps to inspect and adjust their supply lines to avoid tainted sources of conflict minerals.
''Our hope,'' said Darren Fenwick, a senior manager of government affairs for the Enough Project, ''is that the rule is strong enough that companies in industries that aren't doing anything will start to feel the pressure in their supply chains.''

HEADLINE: An Air Travel Manifesto From Fliers Themselves

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A COUPLE of weeks ago, I offered some suggestions for a draft of an On the Road Column Airline Consumer Manifesto. This is an interim follow-up, with comments and suggestions from readers.
As I noted then, the airline industry has issued its own manifesto, ''The Case for a U.S. National Airline Policy,'' calling on the federal government to reduce air travel taxes, curb fuel volatility, improve the air traffic control system and cut regulations.
If the airlines can issue manifestos, I thought, why can't we consumers? 
Lots of readers liked that idea. Business travelers, of course, are the savviest air travelers because they also understand the economics of the airline industry. That said, they insist that the airlines need to become more accountable to consumers.
''By and large consumers are getting exactly what they're willing to pay for, including me,'' said Jack Ellis, a frequent flier from California. Mr. Ellis said that, like all of us, he dislikes jam-packed planes, surly employees and disrupted flights. ''But on the other hand, air travel has gotten cheaper in real terms over the nearly 40 years I've been using it.''
His suggestion was that the airlines work better with the Transportation Security Administration to improve ''the invasive, time-consuming security screening process.'' Most of the process, he added, is ''a waste of time'' for business travelers whose personal profiles are well-known to airlines through frequent flier records and other data.
Given fortified cockpit doors and vigilant passengers and crew, he said, ''The next person who dies on a hijacked flight is likely to be the hijacker, not a passenger or crew member.'' He added: ''Targeted screening and profiling make sense. The one-size-fits-all approach that generates lots of adverse publicity for the T.S.A. does not.''
In recent months, I've been pointing out how the T.S.A. is making progress at checkpoints, using so-called risk-based screening. That's most evident in the agency's new PreCheck expedited security program. Fliers eligible for PreCheck are chosen partly from lists of high-level frequent fliers supplied by a few airlines. But let's add this to the manifesto: Airlines (and airports) need to become more involved with the T.S.A. on the expansion of PreCheck to evaluate and enroll more low-risk fliers.
Here are summaries of other readers' suggestions for a consumer air travel manifesto:
Airlines should stop giving us bad information. Some United Air Lines customers are still seething about some effects of the merger early this month of the computer systems of United and Continental Airlines. Disruptions and other problems were to be expected. But United spokesmen nevertheless insisted that all was going well, even as long angry lines formed at airports like Chicago O'Hare and significant delays mounted.
Answer your phones. Frustrated fliers, including those with high-level elite status, frequently describe waits lasting hours to speak to someone in customer service. Find a way to hire more people to answer the phones. In December, according to the Transportation Department, domestic airlines employed 389,700 workers. In 2007, the peak year, airlines had 419,700 workers. Meanwhile, the number of passengers has grown.
Explain, in Congressional hearings if necessary, what kind of a commercial air travel system we are going to have in the United States, once your mergers and consolidations are through, and once you have finished sharply reducing service at midsize and small airports. Describe in detail which cities will have diminished air service compared with 10 years ago.
Address concerns about frequent flier programs. As a reader, Terry Stanton, put it: ''Run an honest frequent flier program in which one has a reasonable chance to redeem miles for the trip one wants at the standard rate.''
Enough with the attitude. Most airline employees are courteous and professional, but many are not, especially when there are canceled flights that strand passengers at airports where service has been reduced. Airline employees have threatened frustrated customers with arrest merely because employees are annoyed or flummoxed by customers' insistence on better information or a minimal level of service.
''If an airline employee threatens a passenger with arrest, the police should be called to determine what laws were broken or if the passenger constituted a threat to the employee,'' a reader, David Bjellos, wrote. ''The arrogance would stop in about a minute.''
We'll continue this discussion in a future column.

HEADLINE: A Wall St. Firm Advises Greece, With Discretion

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
ATHENS - In unmarked offices here on a dusty block choked with strip clubs and burned-out buildings, several dozen employees of a Wall Street firm spent months poring over bank loan portfolios as Greece struggled with its debt crisis.
They belong to what has become the go-to SWAT team in financial crises. Their employer, BlackRock, may be little known outside financial circles even as it manages a world-leading $3.51 trillion of assets, but the firm is exerting enormous influence as a behind-the-scenes adviser to troubled governments around the globe.
In Greece, BlackRock is helping determine just how much capital the country's banks will need to raise in the coming months. It is a crucial step as Greece tries to fix its banking industry and its broader economy, but the task is a risky one.
Set the capital levels too low and financial firms may not have an adequate cushion to withstand further losses. Set the bar too high and the banks may struggle to find investors willing to come up with the money. In either situation, the government could be forced to step in with additional money, deepening the country's woes. 
BlackRock knows the stakes. Along with Greece, the financial firm has advised the Irish government and the British Treasury. In Ireland, BlackRock's findings formed the basis of a bank's effort to raise an additional $34 billion. The United States Treasury hired BlackRock during the 2008 financial crisis to help value real estate and other assets the government was acquiring as it stepped in to bail out teetering financial firms like the American International Group.
The executive who leads these efforts, Craig Phillips, keeps a poster of the movie ''The Exorcist'' in his office, saying that he sees his job as helping governments and companies confront their problems. ''We have been conditioned to be ultraresponsive,'' he said.
The appeal of BlackRock is that it has the size, systems and expertise to scour and analyze huge volumes of financial data quickly. In Greece, for example, it reviewed 10 million loans in about three months. Another attraction is that unlike other financial firms - say, Goldman Sachs - BlackRock is not known for making splashy bets that can land it in the headlines. It has largely flown beneath the public's radar.
Yet BlackRock is no stranger to controversy. In the United States, the firm - which makes most of its profits by managing money for investors, pension funds, endowments and other institutions - has been criticized for buying and selling some of the same securities that its BlackRock Solutions unit is valuing for the government. Few firms have such access to a vast amount of market-moving information, and that, some critics say, presents a potential conflict of interest.
''Imagine you consult with Greece and you see the inside issues and you realize with greater certainty it's going to go a certain way,'' said Robert Jarrow, a professor of finance at Cornell University. ''How could you not make investment decisions based on that?''
Eyebrows were raised in Greece when the firm was approached to handle loan valuation work for a friendly merger in Greece between two banks it had just reviewed. BlackRock said it hadn't made a decision on whether to accept this assignment. Mr. Phillips added that the company had internal guidelines, which are in place to ''manage actual and perceived conflicts of interest.''
There is little disputing BlackRock's rise as one of the world's most influential players. During the financial crisis in the United States, the firm's chief executive, Laurence D. Fink, turned his Rolodex of contacts into a number of assignments for the federal government. Now, BlackRock Solutions logs revenue of $510 million, up from $198 million in 2007. It earned $17 million on the Greece project.
The call from Greece came during the last week of June. Over the last decade, the country had issued billions of dollars of sovereign debt, prompting a crisis that has crushed the country's economy, pressured its banks and rattled the European financial system.
To help stabilize the system, the Bank of Greece looked for a firm to review the loan portfolios of 18 financial firms. Bank of Greece asked BlackRock and three other firms, Blackstone, Oliver Wyman and Alvarez & Marsal, to submit a proposal on how each would go about valuing the portfolios.
While the other companies had analytical and restructuring credentials, BlackRock had an advantage in having just completed a similar assignment in Ireland. ''They were the only company that had analyzed a banking system in the same period of time,'' said Charalampos Stamatopoulos, a member of the monetary policy council at the Bank of Greece.
News that BlackRock had been hired sent shock waves through the Greek banking system. Officials worried that local banks would have to raise significant levels of capital - as in Ireland - and put additional strain on institutions.
''We had heard about their work in Ireland, and their results caused a lot of panic,'' said Artemis Theodoridis, head of wholesale banking at Alpha Bank. ''It was scary.''
BlackRock faced a number of obstacles. This was its largest assignment yet - in Ireland it looked at just four banks. It was also the first job where staff members did not speak the language.
In a city at times rocked by violent protests, BlackRock sought a low profile. Employees were not allowed to carry or wear anything bearing the company logo. The firm hired 18 armed security guards to transport employees in vans or, in rare cases, on motorcycles. BlackRock even had a code name: Solar, leading some tenants in its office building to think the team was a solar energy company.
As part of the assignment, BlackRock gathered information on millions of loans and used the data to create a view of the loss potential on the portfolios. The banks set up data rooms for BlackRock and uploaded information, allowing the firm to see things like collateral and payment history.
BlackRock and the banks butted heads on some issues. For instance, BlackRock wanted to write all loans backed by third-party guarantees to zero, since they were riskier than those backed by collateral.The banks resisted, but ''in the end there was no room for debate,'' said George Aronis, also of Alpha Bank. The loans were written down to zero.
Jessica Tan and Charles Hatami, two of BlackRock's day-to-day managers in Greece, said that they were surprised by both the quality of the data and the results. Most institutions, they said, did not lend recklessly, as the United States banks did during the real estate boom.
''The consumer lending market is relatively new in Greece, and they were disciplined in their approach,'' Mr. Phillips of BlackRock said. ''Unlike other countries, the Greek consumer is not debt laden.''
Maria Mavridou, alternate director of financial stability at the Bank of Greece, said that BlackRock's findings were likely to be released in the coming weeks by the government. The report will describe the current state of the Greek banking system and outline additional capital requirements.
''They didn't know anything about Greece, but they sure know data and what to do with it,'' she said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Uptown Palazzo Project

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
When the Andrew Freedman Home opened in the Bronx in 1924, it looked like a limestone luxury liner sailing up the Grand Concourse, a grandiosity that advertised its odd function: a privately endowed retirement home for the formerly well-to-do, those who might have lost their money but not their manners or manorial tastes.
''They were expected to have attained a state of reasonable culture,'' commented an article in The New Yorker at the time, ''and not to eat peas with their knives.'' Freedman, who died in 1915, had been an owner of the New York Giants baseball team and a financier of New York's first subway lines, and his unusual will created a retirement home as palazzo, with plush carpets, plentiful servants and formal dress required at dinner. 
By the 1980s the home had fallen on hard times. And though the Mid-Bronx Senior Citizens Council, which came to own it, has made good use of parts of it with a day care center, community programs and an events space, much of the rest of the vast building has been kept sealed off like a tomb, a time-capsule monument to the Bronx's grand past, awaiting a new kind of future. In other words, exactly the sort of place that site-specific, history-scrambling, entropy-obsessed contemporary-art dreams are made of.
For the last several weeks a group of more than 30 artists -- some well known, like Mel Chin, Sylvia Plachy and Bronx veterans like John Ahearn and the collective Tim Rollins and K.O.S. -- have been at work in the home, turning old bedrooms and bathrooms into installations that mine the building's eccentric history as a way of drawing in the life of the borough around it.
An exhibition of the pieces -- organized by No Longer Empty, a nonprofit art group that got its start in 2009 by using spaces made vacant by the recession -- will open April 4, granting the public access to one of the city's stranger Gilded Age palaces for the first time.
''As a kid I used to walk by here all the time, and I never knew what it was for or what was going on inside,'' said the painter and graffiti artist John Matos, better known as Crash, as he worked one recent morning on a subway-theme piece that will cover the walls of a second-floor corner bedroom.
For many years the landmark building, on the corner of East 166th Street, has existed in a kind of open-but-closed limbo. Its ground floor is almost always full of children, in day care and in a Head Start program. Two elegant ballrooms and a book-filled library above have been maintained for weddings and other events, and for several years the Bronx Museum of the Arts, a block away, held outdoor film screenings and other programs at the home.
But Walter E. Puryear, the Mid-Bronx Council's project manager for the home, said that almost 60,000 of its 100,000 square feet remain closed off, and that art collaborations are one way the organization hopes to draw attention to the building and generate support for plans to make more use of it. The hope is to create a small-business incubator, a culinary training program and other socially minded businesses at the home.
''Beauty by itself is a wonderful thing,'' Mr. Puryear said of using parts of the building as a kind of kunsthalle. ''But beauty that inspires people to greater endeavors is even better.''
The artists involved in the project, titled ''This Side of Paradise,'' have been given free rein to rummage through the near-abandoned parts of the building, which have the look of a well-lived-in place left in a hurry: old turntables and VHS cassettes (''Double Dragon in Last Duel''); a black nightgown draped over a closet rod; a pair of plastic leg braces standing together in a hallway; a sheaf of Physicians Mutual insurance papers dated 1974, addressed to a man named Henry Ward.
The artists Elizabeth Hamby and Hatuey Ramos-Fermin plan to use an old hook board where the keys of dozens of the home's residents once hung, labeled with plastic lettering tape that has memorialized only their surnames: Mrs. Kovacs, Mrs. Whipple, Mrs. Bosky, Mrs. Jimenez, the Echts. In one of the preserved ballrooms, the artist Nicky Enright recently created a musical assemblage out of a badly decayed Walters upright piano found upstairs; it now sits with old Remington, Smith-Corona and Underwood manual typewriters atop it like oxpeckers perched on a hippo. Many of the rooms on the third and fourth floors are filled with broken furniture and covered in snowdrifts of paint chips from the crumbling ceilings.
''When people said to me, 'Are you going to try to clean up the hallways?' I said, 'No, there's no way you can put a Band-Aid on something like this,'' said Manon Slome, the president and chief curator of No Longer Empty, who was introduced to the building with the help of Mr. Puryear and Holly Block, the Bronx Museum's director. ''I think you have to start by working in the decay, and then as this place gets more funding, that kind of work can be done.''
Some is already under way, tentatively. Ten of the home's old high-ceilinged rooms have been beautifully restored in a wing that will open in April as a small bed-and-breakfast, furnished with original 1930s and 1940s furniture that has been refinished and reupholstered. Cheryl Pope, a Chicago artist whose piece will feature a choir of strangers she met and recruited from Bronx streets and barbershops, recently spent a night in one of the rooms and said being alone in the cavernous building was a little more than what she had bargained for.
''It felt like I was in 'The Shining,' '' she said, adding that a caretaker, before leaving for the night, handed her a two-foot-long machete. ''I said, 'What's this for?,' and he said it was in case I came across anyone who broke in during the night. Nothing like that happened. There were just a lot of weird noises.''
But Ms. Pope's installation, which involves an artificial, meticulously gold-leafed version of a paint-flaked ceiling, channels a more benevolent supernatural ethos, transforming two of the residents' abandoned old rooms into more of a chapel than a corner of a haunted house.
''There's something about those rooms, left the way they are,'' she said. ''They definitely have a holy quality.''

HEADLINE: Panel Says Schools' Failings Could Threaten Economy and National Security

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's security and economic prosperity are at risk if schools do not improve, warns a report by a panel led by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Joel I. Klein, a former chancellor of New York City's school system. 
''The dominant power of the 21st century will depend on human capital,'' the report said. ''The failure to produce that capital will undermine American security.''
The report said that the State Department and intelligence agencies face critical shortages in the number of foreign-language speakers and that fields like science, defense and aerospace are at risk because a shortage of skilled workers is likely to worsen as baby boomers retire.
According to the panel, 75 percent of young adults do not qualify to serve in the military because they are physically unfit or have criminal records or inadequate levels of education. It said 30 percent of high school graduates do not do well enough on an aptitude test to serve.
The 30-member committee was organized by the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based research and policy organization.
Ms. Rice and Mr. Klein said in interviews that they were encouraged by efforts to improve schools, like the adoption by most states of new learning targets, known as the Common Core, in reading and math, as well as the Obama administration's Race to the Top competition, in which states compete for federal money in exchange for developing a system of teacher evaluations.
Mr. Klein said he hoped the findings would prompt discussion. ''I don't think people have really thought about the national security implications and the inability to have people who speak the requisite languages who can staff a volunteer military,'' he said.
The panel made three main recommendations:
Common Core standards should be adopted and expanded to include science, technology and foreign languages.
Students, especially those in poor schools, should have more choices in where they go to school.
Governors, working with the federal government, should develop a national security readiness audit, to judge whether schools are meeting targets.
Not all panel members agreed with all the report's findings. A dissent by Carole Artigiani, founder of Global Kids, said that a proposed national audit would only raise the stakes for standardized tests, and that money would be better used to improve the neediest school districts. Stephen Walt, an international affairs professor at Harvard, and Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, agreed.
Ms. Weingarten also said that parts of the report undermined schools, and that school choice options like vouchers and charters, which use public funds but are run by a third party, have not proved to be sustainable or to improve schools.

HEADLINE: You Scratch My Back. ...

 BODY:
With their eye on campaign cash, President Obama and lawmakers from both parties have decided they can all get more from corporate constituents if they cooperate to enact legislation that big donors want. 
The legislation is the JOBS Act, or Jump-Start Our Business Start-Ups Act, which passed the House with White House support this month and will be voted on this week in the Senate. JOBS, named in Orwellian fashion, is not about jobs. It is about undoing investor safeguards in federal law, including parts of the Sarbanes-Oxley law and other landmark protections, so that companies can raise money without having to follow rules on disclosure, accounting, auditing and other regulatory mainstays.
Its proponents -- stock exchanges, venture capital groups, biotech start-ups, investment banks -- say that the easier it is for companies to raise money, the more they will grow and hire workers. Its opponents -- the current and former chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the association of state securities regulators, AARP, the Consumer Federation of America, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. labor federation and unions, several big pension funds and many prominent securities experts -- have presented ample evidence to show that deregulation raises the cost of capital by harming investors and impairing markets, making it harder for legitimate companies to thrive.
John Coates of Harvard Law School recently told a Senate banking subcommittee that the proposals in the JOBS Act ''could not only generate front-page scandals, but reduce the very thing they are being promoted to increase: job growth.'' Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, and other supporters, notably Senator Charles Schumer of New York, have responded to the warnings by fast-tracking the bill for passage. Over the past week, Senate Democratic leaders scrapped plans for introducing a Senate version that presumably would have restored some of the protections gutted in the House bill. Instead, they chose to embrace the House version.
When a handful of Democrats objected, Senate leaders agreed to consider a package of investor protections as amendments, but under a procedural tactic that will require 60 votes for them to pass. That will allow many Democrats to vote for the amendments, appearing to support investor protections, but without having to worry about them actually passing. When the amendments fail, the Senate is likely to pass the House version, and Mr. Obama seems likely to go along -- despite the harm that would mean to investors, the markets and the economy.

HEADLINE: At Heart of Health Law Clash, a 1942 Case of a Farmer's Wheat

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- If the Obama administration persuades the Supreme Court to uphold its health care overhaul law, it will be in large part thanks to a 70-year-old precedent involving an Ohio farmer named Roscoe C. Filburn.
Mr. Filburn sued to overturn a 1938 federal law that told him how much wheat he could grow on his family farm and made him pay a penalty for every extra bushel.
The 1942 decision against him, Wickard v. Filburn, is the basis for the Supreme Court's modern understanding of the scope of federal power. It is the contested ground on which the health care case has been fought in the lower courts and in the parties' briefs. And it is likely to be crucial to the votes of Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Antonin Scalia, who are widely seen as open to persuasion by either side.
''Wickard has become so foundational for generations of lawyers that any plausible understanding of the commerce power must come to terms with it,'' said Bradley W. Joondeph, a law professor at Santa Clara University. 
Both supporters and opponents of the health care law say the decision helps their side, and for three days starting next Monday, it will be at the center of the arguments before the Supreme Court about the law's constitutionality.
To hear the Obama administration tell it, the Filburn decision illustrates just how much leeway the federal government has under the Constitution's commerce clause to regulate the choices individuals make in matters affecting the national economy. If the government can make farmers choose between growing crops on their own land and paying a penalty, the administration's lawyers have said, it can surely tell people that they must obtain health insurance or pay a penalty.
Opponents of the law draw a different lesson from Mr. Filburn's case. They say it set the outer limit of federal power, one the health care law exceeds. It is one thing to encourage farmers to buy wheat by punishing them for growing their own, the argument goes. It is another to require people to buy insurance or face a penalty, as the health care law does.
''There's a difference between being given an incentive and compulsion,'' said Michael A. Carvin, a lawyer for the National Federation of Independent Business and several individuals challenging the law.
Mr. Filburn argued, as do opponents of the health care overhaul, that he was challenging a law that was not authorized by the Constitution, which allows Congress to regulate commerce ''among the several states.'' A decision against him, Mr. Filburn said, would move the nation toward a centralized government and ''nullifications of all constitutional limitations.''
The Supreme Court's ruling against him was unanimous.
''Even if appellee's activity be local,'' Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote, referring to Mr. Filburn's farming, ''and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.''
The Obama administration says the decisions of millions of people to go without health insurance have a similarly significant effect on the national economy by raising other people's insurance rates and forcing hospitals to pay for the emergency care of those who cannot afford it.
At the time, the reaction to the Filburn decision emphasized how much power it had granted the federal government.
''If the farmer who grows feed for consumption on his own farm competes with commerce, would not the housewife who makes herself a dress do so equally?'' an editorial in The New York Times asked. ''The net of the ruling, in short, seems to be that Congress can regulate every form of economic activity if it so decides.''
The editorial, like much commentary on the case, seemed to suppose that Mr. Filburn was a subsistence farmer. But in fact he sold milk and eggs to some 75 customers a day, and the wheat he fed to his livestock entered the stream of commerce in that sense, according to a history of the case by Jim Chen, the dean of the law school at the University of Louisville.
In the health care case, the administration has insisted that the overhaul law is a modest assertion of federal power in comparison to the law Mr. Filburn challenged. ''The constitutional foundation for Congress's action is considerably stronger'' for the health care law than for the law that the Supreme Court endorsed in 1942, the administration said in a recent brief. The health care law, the brief said, merely ''regulates the way in which the uninsured finance what they will consume in the market for health care services (in which they participate).''
Opponents of the law take the opposite view, using an analogy. It is true that the federal government may ''regulate bootleggers because of their aggregate harm to the interstate liquor market,'' Mr. Carvin wrote in a recent brief. But the government ''may not conscript teetotalers merely because conditions in the liquor market would be improved if more people imbibed.''
''Yet the uninsured regulated by the mandate,'' the brief went on, ''are the teetotalers, not the bootleggers, of the health insurance market.''
For more than 50 years after ruling against Mr. Filburn, the Supreme Court did not strike down any federal laws on commerce clause grounds. But in a pair of 5-to-4 decisions, in 1995 and 2000, the court invalidated two laws, saying the activities that Congress had sought to address -- guns near schools and violence against women -- were local and noncommercial and thus beyond its power in regulating interstate commerce.
The decisions were part of a renewed interest in federalism associated with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who died in 2005, and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who retired in 2006.
Those two justices were still on the court in 2005 when it issued its last major commerce clause decision, Gonzales v. Raich. That decision was 6 to 3 in favor of upholding a federal law regulating home-grown medicinal marijuana.
Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice O'Connor dissented, as well as Justice Clarence Thomas. But Justices Scalia and Kennedy, who had voted to strike down the laws at issue in the 1995 and 2000 cases, were in the majority.
''The similarities between this case and Wickard are striking,'' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for five members of the court, including Justice Kennedy. ''Here, too, Congress had a rational basis for concluding that leaving home-consumed marijuana outside federal control would similarly affect price and market conditions.''
Justice Scalia wrote a separate concurrence, also citing Wickard v. Filburn.
''Congress may regulate even noneconomic local activity if that regulation is a necessary part of a more general regulation of interstate commerce,'' he wrote, in a passage that the Obama administration quoted prominently in a recent brief in the health care case.
Supporters of the health care law say the Raich decision shows that even completely local and noncommercial conduct may be addressed by the federal government as part of comprehensive economic regulation. Opponents counter that marijuana, like wheat, is a tangible commodity that is bought and sold, while a lack of insurance is not an economic activity.
The administration is probably assured of the votes of the court's four more liberal members, and it needs one more to win the case. How Justices Kennedy and Scalia think about wheat, marijuana, health insurance and Roscoe Filburn may make all the difference.

HEADLINE: On Primary's Eve, Romney Cuts to General Election

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG; Trip Gabriel contributed reporting from Moline, Ill.

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Republican voters have yet to give Mitt Romney a green light to begin a formal campaign against President Obama, so Mr. Romney paid a visit to the president's old neighborhood here on Monday for yet another audition to show he is tough enough to win the general election.
On the eve of the Illinois primary, where he hopes a commanding victory will start extinguishing the insurgent fire of Rick Santorum, Mr. Romney took the luxury of ignoring his Republican rivals. It was one part buoyant confidence and one part symbolic opportunity that led Mr. Romney to deliver an economic speech just a short stroll from Mr. Obama's actual backyard.
The Republican primary calendar is only slightly beyond the halfway mark, with Mr. Santorum and, to a lesser extent, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul, still scrapping for delegates. Mr. Santorum said he presented the sharpest contrast to Mr. Obama, while Mr. Gingrich was off the campaign trail strategizing about how to stop Mr. Romney from getting the nomination and Mr. Paul was all but invisible. 
Hopeful that the results in Illinois could at last begin rallying the party to his side, Mr. Romney sought to signal that he is moving to the next stage -- whether the voters are ready or not -- and assailed the president by name more than a dozen times in the span of 18 minutes without mentioning the other Republican candidates.
''Our choice will not be one of party or personality,'' Mr. Romney said during a lecture-style speech, taking the rare move of trading his jeans and open-collar shirt for a suit and tie and reading from a prompter. ''This election will be about principle.''
In the speech, Mr. Romney avowed a commitment to conservative economic principles and deregulation. But in citing examples of what he said was the stifling hand of the Obama administration, he presented two specific examples, including the phasing out of the incandescent light bulb, that turned out to have their roots in actions taken by President George W. Bush's administration.
Mr. Romney did not directly mention Mr. Santorum, but the Romney team and its allies were intently focused on him, trying to bury him in negative advertising. In Illinois, Mr. Romney had a spending advantage of at least 6 to 1 over Mr. Santorum.
But the voters of Illinois, perhaps including some of the same crossover Republicans who helped contribute to Mr. Obama's own political rise, will now help write the next chapter of the Republican primary. Mr. Romney's aides believe a comfortable victory could be at hand on Tuesday, but Mr. Santorum and the rest of the field showed no signs of stepping aside.
As Mr. Romney previewed general election themes in a speech at the University of Chicago, Mr. Santorum spoke about 120 miles west in Dixon, the boyhood home of Ronald Reagan. He argued that his campaign, unlike Mr. Romney's, was not built around the rises and falls in the economy.
''I don't care what the unemployment rate's going to be,'' Mr. Santorum said, a remark that drew criticism from the Romney campaign. ''It doesn't matter. My campaign doesn't hinge on unemployment rates and growth rates.''
The Illinois results will provide an important test of whether Mr. Romney can regain for good the sense of inevitability he has had sporadically since the New Year -- winning it in New Hampshire; losing it in South Carolina; winning it in Florida; losing it in Minnesota and Colorado and last week in Mississippi and Alabama.
And so it is that Mr. Romney and the ''super PAC'' supporting him, Restore Our Future, have pounded Mr. Santorum on television and radio here, especially on broadcast television, where the Romney forces have spent at least $2 million and the Santorum forces, which have advertised mostly on cable, have spent at least $60,000 according to an analysis by Kantar Media/CMAG.
The anti-Santorum advertisements call him an ''economic lightweight'' and question his policy acumen, a line of attack he appeared to walk into with his comments about the jobless rate.
Mr. Santorum, who has been attacking Mr. Romney for what he said was a lack of core convictions, was still hoping a strong vote from downstate Illinois -- abutting two states where he won, Iowa and Missouri -- would propel him to victory. But he was hesitant to predict an outright win, telling reporters who asked him if he had a chance to overtake Mr. Romney, ''I don't know. If you'd have asked me that last week in Mississippi and Alabama, I'd have said 'no.' ''
His campaign aides indicated that their hopes in this critical primary were fading in light of the heavy advertising campaign against him, especially in the expensive market of Chicago, where the suburban vote could prove decisive for Mr. Romney.
Mr. Santorum's campaign was already beginning to look ahead to contests in Wisconsin on April 3 and in his home state of Pennsylvania, which holds its primary, along with those of New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware, three weeks later. He scheduled his primary night party on Tuesday in Gettysburg, Pa., rather than Illinois.
If New Hampshire and Massachusetts can be a guide, Mr. Romney is stronger than Mr. Santorum in the Northeast. And Mr. Santorum's campaign said it was prepared for a relatively rough April that would be followed by a better May, when the voting moves to several Southern states, including Texas, North Carolina, Kentucky and Arkansas.
In the meantime, the Santorum campaign is continuing to track the small gatherings on the county and district level through the country where delegates will be allotted based on byzantine rules that do not necessarily follow the results of the caucuses and primaries. It is a largely behind-the-scenes process that the campaign believes will be as important to winning the nomination as the popular vote.
Mr. Santorum's ability to block Mr. Romney from reaching the 1,144-delegate mark needed for the nomination could rest to some degree with Mr. Gingrich's ability to stay in the race and win delegates that would otherwise go to Mr. Romney. And Mr. Gingrich is vowing to stay in the race for that reason.
Former Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi told ABC News on Sunday that he voted for Mr. Gingrich in last week's primary, an indication of Mr. Gingrich's continued appeal to some conservatives and their qualms about Mr. Romney. But Mr. Gingrich's rivals could not be blamed for their confusion when Mr. Gingrich spent the weekend not campaigning here but in Washington, strolling along the Tidal Basin to view the cherry blossoms with his wife, Callista.
Mr. Gingrich's aides spent Monday with him in Arlington, Va., planning what they said would be a highly targeted approach to the remaining contests. The plans are necessitated in part by money. A senior aide on Monday said Mr. Gingrich's next financial filing will show a ''nice chunk of debt'' that the campaign hopes to make up for from its list of 176,000 small donors.
But, with a goal that now boils down to preventing Mr. Romney from gaining 1,144 delegates, Mr. Gingrich and his aides on Monday mapped out ''a second half'' focusing on states where he can have maximum impact.
At the strategy session, Mr. Gingrich referred to a chapter in the book ''Ballots and Bandwagons,'' by Ralph Martin, that focused on the brokered 1920 convention that resulted in the nomination of Warren G. Harding, according to one person who attended and who relayed the view of the staff as of now: ''We always understood this was a long campaign, and we realize how far we have come and always been ready for the long march to Tampa if necessary.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 27, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A Political Memo article last Tuesday about the Republican race for the presidency quoted incorrectly from comments by a senior aide to Newt Gingrich regarding the release of his financial report from February. The senior aide said the campaign was expecting to show a ''nice chunk of debt'' from the month. He did not say it was expecting to show a ''huge chunk of debt.''

HEADLINE: A Ferrari Crash in Beijing Leads to More Political Intrigue

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: Luxury cars serve as potent symbols of the widening rich-poor gap in China, and to many Chinese, the deadly late-night crash of a Ferrari in Beijing was not just another traffic accident. First, the police refused to identify the driver, who was killed. Then intrigue grew further when blog posts about the crash were inexplicably deleted overnight. Internet searches for "Ferrari" also have been blocked. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - The real March Madness, at least in Asia, has been the precipitous fall of Bo Xilai, one of China's most flamboyant (and now disgraced) Communist Party bosses. The story has read like a John le Carr rewrite of Raymond Chandler, with the forced singing of "red anthems" from the Maoist era, rumors of cloak-and-dagger corruption, the Eliot Ness of China staging a late-night attempt to defect to the United States, his subsequent detention by State Security agents (under what is creepily being called "vacation-style treatment") and an unprecedented public smackdown of Mr. Bo by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.
Now, it would seem, the Chinese are getting back to their everyday concerns, paying attention to events more mundane and less cataclysmic. For example, the splendid daily report on Internet activity compiled at Baidu Beat found the most-searched-for item on Monday was the fate of Fabrice Muamba, the soccer player who collapsed with a heart attack during a game in London on Saturday.
Other top searches on the day: a story about "Vibrato Grandma," who sang mournfully for her dead husband on "China's Got Talent"; a piece on an American woman, Lizzie Velasquez, who suffers from a wasting disease; and the stranding of four sperm whales on a beach in Jiangsu Province.
But politics is never far off, even in something as ordinary as a traffic accident. Here's the No. 9 story, as reported by Baidu Beat: "At around 4 a.m. Sunday morning, a Ferrari crashed into a bridge in Beijing, killing one passenger and severely injuring the other two. The cause of the crash is unknown.''
Bloggers, microbloggers and tweeters quickly seized on the story, lighting up the Sinosphere with photos, rants and rumors. The intrigue grew when the Beijing police refused to comment about the accident.
By Tuesday morning, a story in the English-language version of the Communist Party newspaper Global Times said that "almost all online information'' about the crash had been deleted overnight, "triggering suspicions as to the identity of the deceased driver.''
The paper said the popular Sina Weibo service "deleted all microblog posts which mentioned the accident, and blocked online searches of the word 'Ferrari.' The Global Times also found that news reports about the crash were deleted from many Web portals.''
Traffic accidents involving luxury cars have their own particular lore in China, especially in Beijing, where many politicians, party princelings and their children drive (or are driven in) high-end sedans and S.U.V.'s. (Mr. Bo's son Guagua, for example, is said to drive a red Ferrari.) 
@niubi @klustout Now I'm really curious about who was driving that Ferrari. Apropos of nothing, anyone seen Guagua in the last coupla days?
- Kaiser Kuo (@KaiserKuo) March 19, 2012
There is special contempt - and some envy, of course - for black Audi A6's, Ferarris and Bentleys. Expensive cars serve as symbols of the so-called Great Divide, the widening wealth gap between China's 1 percenters and everybody else.
A recent poll by Renmin University showed that only 5.3 percent of respondents believe the rich come by their wealth legally. The survey was cited in a story in the People's Daily newspaper about a 24-year-old unemployed man who smashed the windows of two Mercedes-Benzes. 
"Why can some people drive such good cars," the man said in court, "and I have to wander on the streets?" 
It was a tragic car accident in October 2010 that gave rise to a notorious addition to China's sociopolitical vocabulary - the phrase, "My father is Li Gang!'' My colleague in the Beijing bureau, Michael Wines, reported about that accident, when a Volkswagen smashed into a college student, a poor farm girl, who later died.
Michael wrote: "The 22-year-old driver, who was intoxicated, tried to speed away. Security guards intercepted him, but he was undeterred. He warned them, 'My father is Li Gang!' "
Li Qiming, the driver, was the son of Li Gang, a deputy police chief, and propaganda officials quickly threw a cloak of silence over the media, as Michael wrote, "to ensure that the story never gained traction."
Quite the opposite happened, however, and the phrase "My father is Li Gang" has become a notorious and bitter catchphrase for shirking responsibility.
The author and journalist James Fallows, in his blog for The Atlantic, called the Global Times story of a possible cover-up of the Ferrari crash "amazing" and "astounding'' because it was being published by a state-run media outlet. 
"In short," Mr. Fallows writes, "every exposed raw nerve created by the gaping economic and power inequalities of today's China was touched by this episode."
The Anti-Social List at the China Media Project, a media criticism site, suggested, however, that the story was "not astounding" because English versions of state-run media in China are typically intended "for foreign consumption, and work by an entirely different set of standards."

HEADLINE: Many Americans Struggling to Pay Medical Bills

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Roughly a third of Americans are burdened by medical costs, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study finds. 

 BODY:
All eyes will be on the United States Supreme Court next week as it hears arguments in the challenge to the Affordable Care Act. But while debate over health care reform swirls in the political arena, roughly a third of Americans are in families struggling in some way to pay medical bills, a recent study finds.
The study on the financial burdenof medical care, published by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is based on responses to the National Health Interview Survey for the first six months of 2011. The study is based on personal interviews with more than 52,000 people.
The findings aren't too surprising, considering that other recent research finds that the proportion of Americans with health insurance fell during the recent recession.
The C.D.C. analysis found that about a quarter of children age 17 and under were in families struggling to pay medical bills. The likelihood of being in a household unable to pay bills decreased with age, the study found. Just 7 percent of adults age 75 and over were members of such families.
The survey asked participants about whether they had problems paying any medical bills over the last 12 months, whether they were paying any medical bills over time and if they had any medical bills they were unable to pay.
Have you had trouble paying medical bills recently? How are you planning to handle the costs?

HEADLINE: How Housing Prices Burden the Economy

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: A conversation with Matthew Yglesias of Slate, the author of "The Rent Is Too Damn High," a short new electronic book. 

 BODY:
Matthew Yglesias, the Moneybox columnist for Slate, is the author of "The Rent Is Too Damn High," a short new electronic book. The title refers to an obscure political party in New York: The Rent Is Too Damn High Party. In the book, Mr. Yglesias argues that high rent -- by which he means both rents and purchase prices -- is a major drag on the American economy and society. "The real value of Yglesias's book," John Mangin wrote at The Washington Monthly's Web site, "lies in its explanatory power, and in its potential to recast an important issue."
High rent, Mr. Yglesias writes, is "bad for the environment; it promotes long commutes, traffic jams, misery and smog. What's more, high rent is not a fact of nature. It's the result of bad public policy, and it deserves to be taken seriously as one of the critical problems we face."
Below is a transcript of my recent e-mail exchange with him.
Q.
A.
The national average masks enormous variation. Once bubble mania receded, we had a country that contained plenty of affordable places to live. The problem is that those places aren't necessarily where the job opportunities are. Wages and incomes are generally highest in the big coastal metropolises where housing is scarce and prices are high. That leaves us with lots of people migrating to Sun Belt cities where wages are low and lots of newspaper stories about high-income individuals in big coastal cities who don't "feel" rich, because the cost of living - which is driven by real estate - is so very high.
Q.
A.
Yes, land is scarce in certain areas, and that's why land can get very expensive in particular portions of the country. But scarcity of land is why we developed the ability to engage in dense construction.
Once upon a time, Upper Manhattan was farmland. Then it became settled with houses and eventually tall apartment buildings. The problem is that over the past few decades we've continued to build our metropolitan areas outward but have largely stopped repurposing already developed land for more intensive uses. Down on the San Francisco Peninsula or in Arlington County here in the D.C. area and many other fancy suburbs, we have lots of single-family homes sitting on extremely expensive land where the forces of supply and demand might suggest row houses or even apartment buildings. In more urbanized areas, we often have old, relatively short buildings where the economics suggest redevelopment and taller, more modern structures. The only reason these cities exist in the first place is that once upon a time higher demand led to more construction. But more recently, we've put in place a regulatory framework that freezes old patterns into place.
Q.
A.
First off, plenty of them would still be around. This is still a very large country and there's plenty of room for plenty of people to live in suburban-style neighborhoods. In the book I note survey research from Jonathan Levine and Lawrence Frank indicating that about a third of Americans express a strong preference for walking-scale neighborhoods, about a third have a strong preference for suburban-style ones and the rest don't have a strong view. But what we find is that only 5 to 10 percent of the building stock in most metropolitan areas is located in dense urban areas-largely because zoning codes adopted in the postwar decades assume that all new construction should be oriented around automobile use. If you shifted that number up to 30 or 40 percent of units existing in denser neighborhoods, then you'd still find the majority of the houses and the vast majority of the land dedicated to suburbs.
Another point is that if you're interested in truly green spaces - parks and farms and wilderness land rather than lawns - then the best thing to do is to ensure that a healthy fraction of developed land is developed very intensively. To the extent that more people are fitting into denser neighborhoods, that reduces economic incentives to cut down forests or turn pastures into strip malls.
Q.
A.
The mistakes came in two big tranches. One is that in the wake of World War II there was a widespread recognition that the automobile was destined to alter the built environment. Virtually every city in America wound up overreacting to that reality by adopting widespread regulations mandating the provision of large amounts of parking with all new construction. The result is that lots of classic prewar American urban neighborhoods - places that people love, like Dupont Circle in Washington and the brownstone neighborhoods in Brooklyn - would be illegal to build under today's standards. This is folly.
Simultaneously, we've failed to think through the implications of small-scale decisions. In any given metro area, everyone might be better off if a bit more building was allowed throughout the region. But the decisions aren't made on a regionwide level. They're made hyper-locally, and each neighborhood may have reason to fear that more development will mean more noise or more traffic. It's like a tragedy of the commons in reverse - each small unit is a bit too stingy with what it allows, and it all adds up to a big problem.

HEADLINE: Tensions With Iran: Accidents Can Happen

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Like wars, preparations for war can have unintended consequences. Do tensions in the Persian Gulf over claims that Iran is trying to build a nuclear bomb raise the prospect of an accidental conflict? 

 BODY:
LONDON - It is supposed to be a time of hope and new beginnings for the people of Iran as on Tuesday they began celebrating the 13-day New Year festival of Nowruz. But the omens are not good.
Trapped between the seeming intractability of their own government and the increasing bellicosity of its perceived enemies, they could be facing war before the next Nowruz comes around.
Israel's leaders are pondering a possible pre-emptive strike against Iran's nuclear installations, which they insist are being used to develop a nuclear bomb. Western officials are desperately hoping that economic sanctions will force Tehran to fold its hand in an increasingly risky game of diplomatic poker. 
In the meantime, there is the ever-present threat that the region could stumble into war as a result of the unintended consequences of the heightened tension. 
A U.S. war game this month forecast that an Israeli strike on Iran could lead to a wider regional war that could draw in the United States, as Mark Mazzetti and Thom Shanker report. They write:
"The two-week war game, called Internal Look, played out a narrative in which the United States found it was pulled into the conflict after Iranian missiles struck a Navy warship in the Persian Gulf, killing about 200 Americans, according to officials with knowledge of the exercise. The United States then retaliated by carrying out its own strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities."
But there are also fears a conflict could come about by accident.
The U.S. Navy has boosted its presence in the Persian Gulf in a gesture of minatory diplomacy to show Tehran the Obama administration means business. Four mine-sweeping vessels and mine-detecting helicopters will be the latest additions to the fleet.
The Navy is also adding new close-quarter weapons in case there is a clash at sea. "It's like being in an alley with a rifle and maybe what you need is a sawed-off shotgun," Admiral Jonathan W. Greenert, the chief of Naval Operations, explained when he announced the reinforcements last week.
The build-up could raise the risks of an accidental confrontation, although Adm. Greenert says he is determined that it won't. As the two navies eye each other warily, he described his Iranian counterparts as "professional and courteous" mariners who operated "in accordance with the rules of the road."
Ian Bremmer, who heads the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, recently summed up a more negative scenario that could stem from Iran's posture in the Persian Gulf. "More provocations in places like the Strait of Hormuz, which I believe is half a kilometer wide, actually narrower in some places, can lead to accidents. Those accidents can create market-moving events. They can create military conflict. 
"Six months ago, the possibility of military conflict between the United States and Iran was negligible. In 2012, it is not negligible. It would be by accident, but it could happen."
Accidents can happen. As Iranians head for the countryside to celebrate the coming of spring, they will not be alone in praying that, in this case, they don't.

HEADLINE: Jefferies Posts $77 Million Quarterly Profit

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The Jefferies Group said Tuesday that it earned $77 million in its first quarter, as debt trading and investment banking showed renewed life after faltering in the second half of last year. 

 BODY:
3:49 p.m. | Updated 
Profits at the Jefferies Group may have slipped in the first quarter, but the investment bank's results are giving Wall Street a reason to cheer.
Though profit at the firm was down 11 percent from the same time last year, the results of its bond-trading operations have bolstered confidence across Wall Street that the business, the profit engine of many financial firms, is coming back.
The results, reported Tuesday, helped push up the stock price not only of Jefferies, which rose more than 2 percent, but those of its competitors as well. Shares in Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which are set to report earnings next month, rose nearly 2 percent each.
Banks' fixed-income trading operations were quick to rebound after the financial crisis of 2008, and helped stabilize financial firms' revenue. But the European sovereign debt crisis sent convulsions through the bond markets, slicing banks' earnings last fall.
The recent calm that has settled upon the financial world this year has helped restore confidence and stabilized bond trading somewhat. Jefferies more than doubled its revenue from debt trading to $339.1 million from the previous quarter.
Over all, Jefferies said that it earned $77 million, as debt trading and investment banking showed renewed life after faltering in the second half of last year. Jefferies reported $780 million in net revenue for the quarter, up from the period a year earlier.
"Market prices have improved throughout fixed income for the quarter," Richard B. Handler, Jefferies's chairman and chief executive, said in a call with analysts on Tuesday. "A large percentage of the gains were due to healthy customer flows and reasonable bid-ask spreads."
Beyond the revival in trading, the firm's profit also shows the continued survival of a firm whose viability was questioned in the wake of MF Global's collapse after a big bet on sovereign debt. Among the principal critics was the credit ratings firm Egan-Jones, which warned that it would downgrade Jefferies's bond rating unless it raised an enormous amount of capital.
Jefferies swiftly and sternly rebutted analyst concerns that it had a similar problem, selling off its holdings of foreign government bonds within days as a show of strength.
Since then, Jefferies has rebounded. Its stock price has climbed nearly 42 percent so far this year, and it has taken both market share and staff members from weaker rivals. Those include foreign banks that initially sought to expand in the United States, but were forced into retreat, Mr. Handler said on the call.
Other parts of Jefferies's businesses showed improvement as well. Fees from advising companies on mergers and from underwriting bond offerings both rose significantly, contributing to a 20 percent gain in investment banking revenue for the quarter, to $285.8 million.
Mr. Handler highlighted the firm's big mandates, including serving as the sole adviser to the Samson Investment Company on its sale to a group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for $7.2 billion, in one of the largest leveraged buyouts of the past four years.
Not all of the Jefferies first-quarter results were rosy, however. Both the trading of stocks and the underwriting of equity offerings remained depressed from the same time last year. The firm's chief financial officer, Peregrine C. Broadbent, said in Tuesday's call that it had laid off some equities employees.
Its asset-management fees plummeted 77 percent, to $5.6 million, from the period a year earlier, though the division accounts for a relatively small portion of the firm's total revenue.

HEADLINE: Regulators Approve New Derivatives Rules

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved new rules for the $600 trillion derivatives market on Tuesday, aiming to raise competition and impose more rigorous risk management on an industry that played a central role in the financial crisis. 

 BODY:
Regulators approved new rules for the $600 trillion derivatives market on Tuesday, aiming to raise competition and impose more rigorous risk management on an industry that played a central role in the financial crisis. 
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission adopted the rules in a 4-to-1 vote, the agency's latest move to usher in broad new changes in response to the crisis. While the rules are among the most arcane provisions to come from the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, officials say the changes will impose crucial new oversight on the derivatives industry. 
"Though it is quite technical, and some might say it's sort of into the plumbing of the derivatives marketplace, these rules today are critical to promote access, lower risk, and ultimately help in transparency in the market," Gary Gensler, the commission's chairman, said at a public meeting in Washington on Tuesday. "Our country will benefit from financial reform, and in fact, in addition the financial side of the economy will also benefit from greater transparency and competition in the derivatives markets."
 Mr. Gensler, a Democrat, highlighted how the rules would mandate broader competition in the derivatives industry, which is currently dominated by a few big banks. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs currently hold roughly 95 percent of the banking industry's total exposure to derivatives contracts, according to government data. Now banks will be unable to restrict customers from trading with other players in the derivatives market. 
The commission's overhaul also attempts to streamline how trades are processed, setting a standard that clearinghouses must accept or reject trades "as quickly as would be technologically practicable," or a matter of "milliseconds or seconds."
"This lowers risk to the markets by minimizing the time between submission and acceptance or rejection of trades for clearing," Mr. Gensler explained. 
The new measures impose a battery of risk-management rules on banks and other firms that trade derivatives. Under the regime, firms must conduct "stress tests" of all potentially risky customer positions, evaluate their ability to meet margin requirements every week and test all lines of credit yearly. 
Scott D. O'Malia, a Republican member of the commission, cast the lone dissenting vote, saying the agency was failing to evaluate the economic costs. "We still suffer from the lack of quantitative analysis," he said. 
But proponents of financial regulation cheered. 
"The commission sent a loud message to Wall Street: no more dark markets and no more predatory behavior," Dennis Kelleher, the leader of Better Markets, a nonprofit advocacy group, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: European Banks Would Have Passed Fed's Stress Test

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Analysts at Barclays ran the numbers to figure out whether European banks would have passed the Fed's most recent test. 

 BODY:
LONDON -- After years of turmoil in the financial markets, regulators in both the United States and Europe have put banks through the wringer to see if they would be able to weather future shocks.
Last week, the Federal Reserve published its latest stress test of the country's financial institutions. Fifteen of the 19 banks included in the test, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, met the Fed's criteria.
That follows similar efforts by European regulators, who have conducted their own checks on the Continent's banks. In the latest stress test, published last December, firms were told to raise an additional 114.7 billion euros ($152.7 billion) to shore up their capital reserves.
Authorities on both sides of the Atlantic have used different methods for their stress tests. But how would banks compare on an apples-to-apples basis? Analysts at Barclays ran the numbers to figure out whether European banks would have passed the Fed's most recent test.
Here's what they had to say:
"We believe the 14 large European banks we cover have enough capital in aggregate to pass a representative version of the U.S. stress test.
"For European banks, our conclusion that the 14 large European banks we cover have enough capital in aggregate to pass a representative version of the U.S. stress test illustrates the improvement in capital achieved by the sector and the conservatism of current capital redistribution plans."
The banks that the Barclays analysts cover include HSBC, Banco Santander and Deutsche Bank.
Barclays said that it was unlikely that European banks would have fallen below the Fed's 5 percent benchmark for Tier 1 common ratios. Indeed, the analysts said for that to happen, the combined losses for all the banks would have to exceed 600 million euros. That remained unlikely, they added, despite continuing concerns about the health of the European economy.

HIGHLIGHT: Glencore has slowly expanded its agricultural business beyond Europe and Russia into markets like Australia. With Canada's position as a top wheat exporter, the Viterra deal gives Glencore much more global influence. 

 BODY:
OTTAWA - Glencore International, the Swiss commodities trader, entered the North American agriculture market on Tuesday with a widely anticipated deal to acquire Viterra, the largest Canadian grain company, for $6.2 billion.
The all-cash transaction comes months before the end to the Canadian Wheat Board's monopoly on export sales of a variety of grains. Canada is the world's third-largest wheat exporter and the leading exporter of durum wheat, the variety most prized by pasta makers.
Glencore is best known as a mineral trading company and is currently trying to get regulatory and antitrust approval to buy the remainder of the mining firm Xstrata it does not own for $41 billion.
But it has been gradually expanding its agricultural business beyond Europe and Russia into other grain markets including Australia, where it started operations nine years ago and where Viterra also has substantial assets. With Canada's strong position as a wheat exporter, the deal gives the company much more global influence than it had previously in grain trading.
Glencore was founded by Marc Rich, a financier who fled the United States rather than face federal tax evasion charges and was granted a pardon by PresidentBill Clinton on his last day in office in 2001.
The Viterra purchase gives Glencore its first major agricultural holding in North America. During a news conference, Chris Mahoney, Glencore's director of agricultural products, suggested that the company would look for another major deal as part of its planned expansion into the United States.
"It would always have been difficult for us to grow silo by silo in North America," he said.
The transaction, which was unanimously approved by Viterra's board, values the company's shares at 16.25 Canadian dollars apiece, 48 percent above the price where Viterra was trading before it announced it was being pursued.
Now that the wheat board monopoly is ending, Viterra may be the sole buyer for many farmers in areas where it is the only the grain elevator operator in the region. But in an effort to prevent the deal from being blocked by Canada's foreign investment review agency or the country's competition regulator, Glencore has already struck two deals to sell some of Viterra's assets to Canadian companies.
Agrium, a Canadian fertilizer producer, will pay 1.8 billion Canadian dollars for Viterra's farm supply stores and its investments in the fertilizer industry. Richardson International, a 155-year-old Canadian grain handler, will get 19 of Viterra's grain elevators and some other asset for 800 million Canadian dollars.
Derek G. Brewin, an agriculture economist at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, said that the sale of the grain elevators may alleviate any competition concerns posed by the deal. He said that most of the assets being transferred are in areas which are currently dominated by Viterra.
"That's good in competition terms for farmers," Professor Brewin said.
Viterra controls about 45 percent of grain handling in Canada. Curt Vossen, the president of Richardson, said that after the elevator sale, his company and Glencore would each have about 34 percent of the market.
"This puts us into markets where we've long wanted to be involved," Mr. Vossen said.
Less clear immediately is the deal's fate before under Canada's foreign investment review laws. Unlike competition cases which are made by handled by independent investigators and a tribunal, decisions under foreign investment laws are political.
The province of Saskatchewan, which Viterra is based, could wield influence over the federal government's review of foreign ownership rules. Previously, the province pushed Canada's federal government to scuttle a $38.6 billion purchase of the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, a major fertilizer producer, by BHP Billiton, the large Australian mining company in 2010.
Mr. Mahoney said the Viterra deal did not face the same challenges as the Potash case. He said that Regina, Saskatchewan, where Viterra is based, would become the headquarters for Glencore's Canadian agricultural businesses as well as any operations it acquires in the United States.
Viterra has a strong emotional attachment to some Canadian farmers and communities. The company was founded in 2007 after the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, a former farmers' cooperative, acquired Agricore United, a grain handler that itself was formed from cooperatives in Alberta and Manitoba.
Professor Brewin said that many farmers still remember that their grandparents signing the charters that created those cooperatives - an attempt by farmers to reduce the influence of private traders. The cooperatives' elevators were symbols of rural Western Canada. During the contentious debate over the future of the wheat board in the past year, some people expressed concern that an end to its monopoly would force Viterra into foreign hands.

HIGHLIGHT: FiveThirtyEight's look at the Republican electorate in Illinois and how it is likely to vote. 

 BODY:
As FiveThirtyEight has discussed, the political and cultural divide between the Chicago area and the rest of Illinois is stark.
In the state's Republican primary on Tuesday, Mitt Romney should excel in Cook County, where Chicago is located, and in the five "collar counties" that surround it. Rick Santorum will find more support in the rest of the state, particularly in the south. The turnout will determine whether Mr. Santorum has a chance -- or how big Mr. Romney's margin will be, since the polls have tipped in his direction.
To get a more detailed sense of Illinois's political landscape, FiveThirtyEight spoke to Paul Green, the director of the Institute for Politics at Roosevelt University and a political analyst for WGN Radio.
Cook County
Anchored by Chicago, the nation's third largest metropolitan area at 9.7 million inhabitants, Cook County is overwhelmingly Democratic. Still, because of the sheer size of its population, Cook County contributed a fifth of the vote in Illinois's 2008 Republican primary, with most of those voters located outside the Chicago city limits.
Republican voters in Cook County are moderate on social issues. They are business-oriented and more affluent than the state as a whole. Republican votes will emanate from communities like Evanston, where many residents work in Chicago's financial markets (Evanston is also the home of Northwestern University), and Schaumburg, which has the state's second largest tax base after Chicago. Schaumburg is home to a number of corporations, including Motorola and Sears, both of which have their headquarters there. This is the establishment of the Republican establishment. In the 2008 primary, Senator John McCain won Cook County with 52 percent of the vote.
It would be a shock if Mr. Romney did not win a large majority of Cook County's votes, although Mr. Santorum might have a few stronger areas in the multiethnic and more culturally conservative suburbs to the west and south of Chicago, which make up the Third Congressional District. The Third District is represented by a Democrat, Dan Lipinski, but Mr. Lipinski is socially conservative; he opposes same-sex marriage and is against abortion except when the mother's life is at risk.
The question in Cook County is not so much whether Mr. Romney will win but the margin he can secure there. If his margin climbs out of the low teens, Mr. Romney will be in good shape in Illinois.
The Collar Counties
The "collar counties" -- DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will -- resemble the suburban parts of Cook County and should also be strong areas for Mr. Romney. Republican voters in these densely packed suburban counties are generally well educated and well off. For the most part, this is the Chamber of Commerce wing of the party, focused on the economy, taxes and business regulations. In 2008, about a third of the primary electorate came from the collar counties.
Historically, the collar counties were more solidly Republican, but in recent elections the region has leaned more Democratic. The shift is typified in the Sixth Congressional District, which consists mostly of DuPage County. DuPage residents began to punch the Democratic ticket more often in the 1990s, as local voters -- concerned about fiscal issues -- balked at the national Republican Party's tilt into cultural conservatism.
In addition to typical suburban bedroom communities, where residents commute to Chicago, DuPage County has also been creating local jobs at a fast pace, at least before the recession hit. The corporate headquarters of Ace Hardware and McDonald's are located in Oak Brook, as is McDonald's Hamburger University. DuPage County will be among the most important counties to watch on Tuesday. Mr. Romney is favored there, but if it is close, Mr. Santorum may have a chance at an upset victory in Illinois.
Another collar county where Mr. Romney is likely to find support is Lake County, which includes the North Shore, a string of affluent suburbs along Lake Michigan. The North Shore has long been home to Chicago's elite. It is an area where everyone has a friend who owns a Nascar team.
Downstate
As you travel west out of Chicago, through the collar counties, you enter Kendall County, the industrial Fox River Valley and "downstate" Illinois.
This region is something of a transition between Chicago and its suburbs and the rest of the state. As urban flight brought families streaming out of the Chicago area, the population of Kendall County surged, and an exurban area became more of a suburban/exurban mix. In the collar counties, residents commute to Chicago. In Kendall County, residents commute to the collar counties.
Traveling farther west you arrive in more solidly Republican territory. Ronald Reagan grew up in Dixon, Ill., in Lee County. But the northwestern region of Illinois isn't as Republican as it once was. In 2004, President George W. Bush won a smaller share of the vote than his father did in 1988 in almost all of Illinois's northern counties.
Southwest of Chicago, heavy manufacturing, farming and industrial agriculture begin to take over. In Peoria, in Peoria County, Caterpillar is the largest employer. 
Farther south is Springfield, the state capital. Although Springfield itself is fairly moderate -- as is the Champaign-Urbana area up Interstate 72, where the University of Illinois is located -- these communities are not very typical of the region.
To the southeast of Springfield lies a vast stretch of prairie land where large industrial farms grow soybeans and corn. This is fertile ground for Mr. Santorum. In southern Illinois, racial diversity dissipates and conservatism has more of a cultural tinge than in the north. Counties in the south, like Effingham County, have large numbers of evangelical Christian voters, a group that has been among the most resistant to Mr. Romney.
This was Mike Huckabee's strongest area in 2008. Mr. Santorum will need to run up huge margins in the south, particularly in the more populous counties, like St. Clair County and Madison County, to compete statewide.
Finally, at the southern tip of the state is Cairo. It is pronounced "CARE-oh", unlike the African city, but to a typical Chicagoan it might as well be in Egypt. Cairo is about a six-hour drive from Chicago, but it's only three hours from the Mississippi border.

HEADLINE: The Origin of Modern Republican Fiscal Policy

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: The author of an extraordinarily influential article about supply-side economics and tax cuts was not dogmatic on the issue, in contrast to many who advocate those policies today, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
In 1976, the journalist Jude Wanniski wrote an essay, "Taxes and a Two-Santa Theory," little noticed at the time and virtually unknown today, that put forward a theory that has had extraordinary influence on the Republican Party. Indeed, virtually everything Republicans say about taxes and spending today echoes that theory.
In 1974, Mr. Wanniski attended a conference sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. One speaker was Robert Mundell, who had worked with the conference organizer, Arthur Laffer.
In his conference paper, Professor Mundell first articulated what came to be called "supply-side economics." He said the mainstream economic view, based on the theories of John Maynard Keynes, was all wrong. Keynesians advocated easy money to stimulate growth and a tight fiscal policy to fight inflation.
This was the exact opposite of what was necessary, Professor Mundell said. He advocated a tight money policy to fight inflation and tax-rate reductions to stimulate growth.

Mr. Wanniski wrote a commentary, "It's Time to Cut Taxes," about Professor Mundell's view that was published in The Wall Street Journal on Dec. 11, 1974. He wrote a much longer description of supply-side economics, "The Mundell-Laffer Hypothesis - A New View of the World," that was published in the spring 1975 issue of The Public Interest, an academic journal edited by Irving Kristol.
Mr. Wanniski's most important contribution to the emerging supply-side philosophy, however, was his "Two-Santas" article, published in The National Observer on March 6, 1976. The Observer was a weekly published by Dow Jones that folded in 1977; consequently, it has been pretty much forgotten. (The article doesn't even appear among the archives of Mr. Wanniski's work at the Polyconomics Web site; I retyped it myself from a reprint Jack Kemp used to hand out when I worked for him, and I posted it here.)
The essence of the Wanniski argument was that each political party needed to be a different sort of Santa Claus. The Democrats were the spending Santa Claus, promising more government benefits. The Republicans should be the tax-cut Santa Claus, he said.
Many of the nation's problems in 1976 stemmed from the unwillingness of Republicans to play that proper role. Instead of being the tax-cut Santa, they had become the party of fiscal austerity. The balanced budget was the sine qua non of Republican economic policy. This was both bad economics and bad politics, Mr. Wanniski said.
Instead of worrying about the deficit, he said, Republicans should just cut taxes and push for faster growth, which would make the debt more bearable.
Mr. Kristol, who was very well connected to Republican leaders, quickly saw the political virtue in Mr. Wanniski's theory. In the introduction to his 1995 book, "Neoconservatism: The Autobiography of an Idea," Mr. Kristol explained how it affected his thinking:
I was not certain of its economic merits but quickly saw its political possibilities. To refocus Republican conservative thought on the economics of growth rather than simply on the economics of stability seemed to me very promising. Republican economics was then in truth a dismal science, explaining to the populace, parent-like, why the good things in life that they wanted were all too expensive.
Republicans didn't immediately embrace the two-Santa theory, but began to after Ronald Reagan's victory in 1980, when he ran mainly in favor of a big tax cut, with far less emphasis on deficit reduction. In office, Reagan pushed for domestic spending cuts but also sharply raised spending for favored programs such as the military.
Although the budget deficit rose to 6 percent of gross domestic product in 1983 from 2.7 percent in 1980, Reagan easily won re-election in 1984. This further convinced Republicans that the deficit was a losing issue and only tax cuts mattered for political success.
The final straw was George H.W. Bush's support for a tax increase in 1990 to reduce the deficit, which many Republicans say sealed his defeat in 1992 by Bill Clinton.
Since then, fealty to tax cuts and lip service to deficits has become Republican dogma.
Among its enforcers is Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform, which makes support for tax cuts and opposition to tax increases a litmus test for all Republicans.
In The Boston Globe's Sunday magazine this week, Mr. Norquist explains that his famous tax pledge owes much to Mr. Wanniski's two-Santa theory. Indeed, Mr. Norquist said he thought of the same idea himself when he was in the seventh grade.
I worked for Mr. Wanniski in the mid-1980s and know that he wasn't obsessive about never raising taxes. He wanted economic growth and thought tax-rate reductions were the best way to achieve it, at least in the 1970s. But if higher taxes would raise growth, then he would support them. As he explained in an e-mail to Ben Bernanke, at the time the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, on Aug. 11, 2005 (on which I was copied):
I for one am always ready to listen to arguments for higher taxes, more regulation and restraints on free markets, as I might be persuaded that under certain circumstances they would "invite," not "stimulate" (a Keynesian idea), long-term growth. I'm not "anti-government," in other words. (The Grover Norquist idea of opposing all tax increases is dumb, and Grover knows I believe that.)
Unfortunately, Mr. Wanniski opened Pandora's box when he let loose the two-Santa theory. Republicans are now bound to it, whether they know it or not. As Keynes once put it, "Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back."

HEADLINE: Bernanke, Back to the Classroom

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, looks like a professor. He talks like a professor. Indeed, he used to be a professor. And on Tuesday, he is going to teach a college class at George Washington University. 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, looks like a professor. He talks like a professor. Indeed, he used to be a professor.
And on Tuesday, he is going to teach a college class.
Professor Bernanke will deliver a series of four one-hour lectures about the Fed to students at George Washington University starting Tuesday at 12:45 p.m.
The Fed will stream video of the lectures on this Web site. (Update: you can also read my Twitter account of the Tuesday lecture.)
The first lecture, "Origins and Mission of the Federal Reserve," covers the period leading up to the creation of the central bank in 1913.

Subsequent classes will cover the Fed's role in the Great Depression (bad, in the instructor's view); the Fed's role in the Great Recession (rather good); and finally, the Fed's challenges in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis.
The lectures are the latest extension of Mr. Bernanke's efforts to increase the Fed's engagement with the general public. He has appeared twice on the CBS News program "60 Minutes" and held town-hall meetings with college students and military personnel. Since last year, he has held news conferences after selected meetings of the Fed's policy-making committee. Under his leadership, the Fed has increased the availability of information about its internal deliberations. Earlier this month, the Fed launched a Twitter feed, @federalreserve.
The lectures also mark a return to the classroom for Mr. Bernanke, who was chairman of the economics department at Princeton University before starting his first tour of duty on the Federal Reserve's board of governors in 2002.
His new class includes 30 students selected through an essay contest. While Mr. Bernanke will teach only four classes, it is a complete course, with the rest taught by faculty members. The class is called "Reflections on the Federal Reserve and Its Place in Today's Economy," and for those 30 students, there will be homework.
Mr. Bernanke, however, will not be marking up the papers.
 "The one thing he was firm about," Tim Fort, a business professor at George Washington who helped to arrange the class, told The Associated Press, "was that he was not going to grade papers."

HEADLINE: The Breakfast Meeting: Rick Santorum, Journalist; and 'John Carter' Slays Disney Earnings

BYLINE: BRUCE HEADLAM


HIGHLIGHT: Also, a "Desperate Housewives" cliffhanger, Oprah Winfrey's network lays off staff and Jeremy Lin stars for Volvo. 

 BODY:
Newt Gingrich isn't the only Republican candidate with a long written record. Rick Santorum, writes Jeremy W. Peters, has built up a large journalistic rsum over his career, with contributions to many newspapers and a two-year stint as a columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer. But unlike Ron Paul, who has disavowed some of the articles that appeared under his name, Mr. Santorum will have no trouble owning up to his work, which includes attacks on climate change scientists and Hollywood (although he found the movie "Juno" to be "heartening").
"He displayed many of the traits that define him as a presidential candidate today: a deep and unwavering Catholic faith, a suspicion of secularism and a conviction that the country was on a path toward cultural ruin," Mr. Peters writes.
A mistrial was declared by the judge in the "Desperate Housewives" lawsuit filed by Nicollette Sheridan after the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Ms. Sheridan alleged that the show's producer, Marc Cherry, had her character killed from the ABC series after the actress revealed that he had slapped her on set. "The two-week trial served up a mix of drama and dark comedy worthy of the show itself, revealing behind-the-scenes stories that the network probably would have preferred to keep quiet," writes Ian Lovett. Unlike her character, Ms. Sheridan will have a second life in court as her lawyer plans to refile.
Walt Disney Studios announced that it would take a $200-million writedown related to the disappointing box office for its "John Carter" movie, writes Brooks Barnes. That figure is larger than what analysts had predicted for the science-fiction flop. Mr. Barnes had previously written about the mix of high hopes, lavish spending and internal politics that pushed the normally risk-averse Disney into the risky venture in the first place.
Jeremy Lin, who briefly became a basketball sensation for the New York Knicks, has signed a deal to be a spokesman for the United States operations of the Swedish car Volvo, reports The Wall Street Journal. "You may not immediately see the connection between me and Volvo," Mr. Lin said in a prepared statement, neglecting to point out that Volvo was once considered the official car of his alma mater, Harvard. The Journal points out another connection: "Volvo is owned by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. The company is trying to boost Volvo sales in China as part of a strategy to double the brand's global sales to 800,000 vehicles by 2020."
OWN, the struggling TV channel started by Oprah Winfrey, announced that it was laying off 30 people in New York and Los Angeles as part of a corporate restructuring, writes Brian Stelter. "It is difficult to make tough business decisions that affect people's lives, but the economics of a start-up cable network just don't work with the cost structure that was in place," Ms. Winfrey said in a statement on Monday.
John Cowles Jr., the longtime newspaper publisher and philanthropist in Minneapolis, died at the age of 82, writes Bruce Weber. During his tenure, the morning Tribune and the evening Star "won praise for aggressive local reporting, increased arts and science coverage and support for the civil rights movement and the Equal Rights Amendment in editorials." Long after his papers began to struggle -- the result in part of attempts to expand the company by Mr. Cowles -- he continued to be a force for philanthropy in the city, which at times put him at odds with his own newsroom.

HEADLINE: A Trip Abroad That's Unlikely to Inspire the Mayor

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Mayor Bloomberg has shown himself to be receptive to ideas tested elsewhere, but he should be able to resist some undesirable ideas that will fall his way in rigid Singapore. 

 BODY:
 A good thing about a mayor who believes he already knows pretty much all he needs to know is that he's not likely to acquire really bad habits as he floats around the world.
 This trait should serve Michael R. Bloomberg well on his arrival Tuesday in Southeast Asia for visits to two authoritarian countries, Singaporeand Vietnam, where he will give a talk on urban sustainability and hand out awards in the name of his philanthropic foundation. 
 While any American ought to be humble in discussing Vietnam, given our country's wretched history there, the fact is that it doesn't have much to teach a democrat. The most recent human rights report from the State Department, issued last April, described a Communist state where "citizens could not change their government and political opposition movements were prohibited," and where "the government increased its suppression of dissent." 
 The greater interest here is Singapore, a tiny republic admired by many for its strong economy and high standard of living. Singapore is the sort of orderly place where you may think you can learn a trick or two - at least if order matters a lot more to you than free expression does.
 Mr. Bloomberg is scheduled to speak at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, named for the founder of modern Singapore, an autocrat of the first order. A public policy school bearing his name sounds as if it could be a cousin of the Vladimir V. Putin Open Society Institute, should such an enterprise come into being.
 You never know, though, when a New York mayor may fall victim to a phenomenon known in clinical circles as E.K.S., short for Ed Koch Syndrome.
 Three decades ago, Mayor Edward I. Koch traveled to China, and was fascinated by all those people getting around on bicycles. That was well before China became an economic behemoth. Once back home, Mr. Koch ordered up concrete-and-asphalt bike lanes for New York. But they didn't work out, and soon enough he had the lanes removed. (In those days, mayors were more willing to acknowledge a measure of fallibility.)
 Mr. Bloomberg has shown himself to be receptive on occasion to ideas tested elsewhere. His unsuccessful attempt to impose "congestion pricing" for cars in Manhattan had London as a model. Paris has the sort of bike-sharing program that is planned for New York. 
 But the mayor should be able to resist some undesirable ideas that will fall his way in rigid Singapore, where it doesn't take much to step out of line.
 Lee Kuan Yew hated gum-chewing. So sales of gum are banned there except for brands claiming to have "medicinal" or "dental" value. As tempting as a similar ban here would be to control the plague of sidewalk splotches caused by people spitting out their gum, it's probably a nonstarter in New York.
 Caning is another Singapore practice that Mr. Bloomberg should be able to pass on. That punishment is imposed for serious crimes but also for certain nonviolent offenses familiar to New Yorkers, like vandalism and immigration-law violation.
 In 2010, Singapore courts ordered 3,170 people to be caned, according to the State Department's human rights report for that country. The report provided intriguing details. Did you know that the cane is made of rattan, and is four feet long and half an inch in diameter? It is also soaked in water and treated with antiseptic. Apparently, it's O.K. to hurt people like the dickens, but not risk infecting them.
 But Singapore has a lighter side. Every now and then, it organizes a campaign to get its people to smile more. Two years ago, mirrors were even installed at some bus stops so that Singaporeans could see if they were at their beaming best. Do you think this could be a program worth imitating in New York?
 Didn't think so.
 Oh, but here is something to watch out for:
 Singapore's constitution guarantees the right to peaceful assembly. But that's more on paper than in reality. Police permission is required, and the definition of "public assembly" is, shall we say, quite narrow. It may "include events staged by as few as one person," the State Department report said, adding that "spontaneous public gatherings or demonstrations were virtually unknown."
 You can see, in this age of Occupy Wall Street, where Mr. Bloomberg might find restrictions like that awfully enticing. We'll just have to hope he doesn't succumb too readily to E.K.S. on that score.

HEADLINE: Making Sense of Campaign Fund-Raising Totals

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: In a new era of "super PACs," unlimited corporate giving and economic distress, it's hard to judge the success of a presidential campaign's fund-raising. 

 BODY:
It has become a ritual every four weeks -- the moment when the presidential campaigns reveal how much cash they hauled in over the previous month.
On Monday, President Obama's campaign trumpeted its number: $45 million for the month of February. Mitt Romney's quickly followed with his take: $11.5 million. Rick Santorum collected $9 million. Ron Paul raised about $3.3 million. 
O.K., but here's a question: Is that a lot? 
In the past, one might compare the totals to previous years and previous candidates to get a sense of how the current crop of contenders are stacking up financially. But in a new era of "super PACs," unlimited corporate giving and economic distress, it's hard to find another moment in history that's comparable. 
Without that comparison, the public is left without much context to help it understand the fund-raising reports. To make matters worse, the candidates each spin the numbers to their own benefit, making it tough to know what's really true.
For example, Mr. Obama's campaign has been eager to portray its fund-raising as somewhat lacking in recent weeks. Jim Messina, the campaign manager, has gone out of his way to say that he's worried about the pace of donations from a Democratic base that just assumes the money will keep rolling in.
"They're waiting to donate until we have a clear opponent," he wrote in a recent e-mail to supporters. "There's too much at stake, and not enough time, to be doing that."
So, $45 million isn't a lot? Here are some things to consider as one ponders that question.
SUPER PACS: The biggest development that makes it difficult to assess presidential fund-raising is the presence of so-called super PACs, which did not exist in a presidential campaign before this election cycle.And the difference they make is huge.
If a candidate like Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney sees a reduction in donations to his campaign, it might be a reflection of a lack of enthusiasm. Or it could simply be donors deciding that they'd rather donate -- often anonymously -- to the super PAC supporting that candidate.
The super PAC supporting Mitt Romney, Restore Our Freedom, has been vacuuming up money from big-dollar donors for a year now -- and has been spending it in an effort to get him the nomination. Last month, Mr. Obama's campaign finally blessed the super PAC backing him, Priorities U.S.A. Action, which could lead to some siphoning off of his wealthy donors.
In February 2008, Mr. Obama raised $56 million during his battle with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York. That's $11 million more than his 2012 total for that month, but it's hard to know whether the lower number this year is because donors might be waiting to give to a super PAC down the road, have soured on Mr. Obama or are just holding on to their money until later in the process.
And then there are the outside groups like American Crossroads, the super PAC headed by Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's former adviser, who has pledged to raise $200 million to help defeat Mr. Obama. If he makes good on that promise, the president's financial advantage over his Republican opponent might not be as great as it would otherwise seem.
INCUMBENCY: Another challenge when it comes to comparing fund-raising numbers is that Mr. Obama now occupies the White House. That makes it difficult to compare his tally this time around to the amount he raised in 2008.
Normally, being president makes it easier to raise money. But Mr. Obama has angered some of his wealthy supporters -- like bankers, hedge fund managers and some in Hollywood -- by pushing policies they don't like. That appears to have affected his financial support in those areas.
And the White House argues that because Mr. Obama does not have a primary opponent in this election, the fund-raising will be different. They say that Republican attempts to warn of a $1 billion Obama reelection campaign is both wrong and dangerous for Democratic enthusiasm.
One option would be to compare Mr. Obama's fund-raising to that of George W. Bush's toward the end of his first term. By that measure, Mr. Obama trounced Mr. Bush, who raised just $13.7 million in February 2004. 
But that's deceiving, because much of Mr. Obama's $45 million was for the Democratic National Committee, and current laws allow Mr. Obama to raise such money in $30,000 chunks -- something that was not legal eight years ago.
THE ECONOMY: It's hard to know how much to make of the economic downturn. The economy was roaring in 2004, and in early 2008 it had not yet cratered. So it's possible that economic uncertainty is holding back some donors who might otherwise have given to the candidates.
That should affect the Republican candidates and Mr. Obama. But it does make it even harder to compare the current fund-raising numbers to those in past elections.
BURN RATE: And finally, it's hard to judge how the candidates are doing financially because we know so little about how they spend the money they raise.
Some Republicans have noted, for example, that Mr. Obama's campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars, burning through their cash quickly and leaving the president -- perhaps -- with less of a financial advantage than it might appear. 
But that depends on how Mr. Obama is spending that money. If he's frittering it away on high-priced consultants and paying a lot to raise every dollar, Mr. Obama could struggle later on. If he's using the money to build a 50-state campaign infrastructure at a time when Republicans are arguing among themselves, it would probably be money well spent.
That's certainly what Mr. Obama's campaign argues. Ben LaBolt, a spokesman, said that "while the funds the Republicans are raising are being spent carpet-bombing each other on the air, we are making a down payment on our efforts to win in November by building the largest grassroots campaign in history."

10:09 P.M. | Gingrich Says He Will Stay in Race and Stop Romney
Mr. Gingrich said Tuesday night that "phase one" for himself and Mr. Santorum in the days ahead must be stopping Mr. Romney from getting enough delegates to claim the Republican presidential nomination.
Having skipped campaigning in Illinois and faced with mounting campaign debts, Mr. Gingrich said on Fox News that he was staying in the race because he believes voters would choose him as the nominee after rejecting Mr. Romney.
If Mr. Romney fails to get the 1,144 delegates he needs to wrap up the nomination, Mr. Gingrich said that "then we'll have a real conversation about who can best beat Barack Obama."
Mr. Gingrich said that he believes voters would turn to him as the best person to debate Mr. Obama in the fall. He said his repeated discussion about the need to produce more energy in the United States was putting Mr. Obama on the defensive.
"If the key is who can stand here and take him on head to head, I think I'm proving every day," Mr. Gingrich said. "He is losing this argument over expensive gasoline."
- 
10:02 P.M. | After Defeat, Santorum Vows to Press On
Rick Santorum sounded defiant after being badly beaten in Illinois on Tuesday night, promising supporters that he would continue to fight for the Republican presidential nomination.
Speaking in Gettysburg, Pa., Mr. Santorum said the Republican Party needed someone with principles to provide a dramatic contrast with Mr. Obama.
"There is one candidate in this race who can go out and make that contrast," he said. "Someone who has a track record of being for you, being for limited government, being for solutions that empower people."
Despite losing to Mr. Romney by double-digits in Illinois, Mr. Santorum said it was "great to be back in Pennsylvania" and promised to come back in five weeks for the primary there.
"We've got five weeks till a big win and a big delegate sweep in Pennsylvania," he said. "We must go out and fight this fight."
Mr. Santorum assailed Mr. Romney without naming him directly, saying the party could not afford a candidate who did not know what he stood for, or who stood for policies like Mr. Obama's health care plan.
Mr. Santorum also took a shot at both Mr. Romney, who used a teleprompter to give a speech a few minutes earlier, and Mr. Obama, who regularly uses teleprompters for big speeches.
"I don't happen to have one here tonight," he joked, earning applause from the crowd. 
Mr. Santorum promised to press on and said that "we're feeling very, very good about winning Louisiana on Saturday."
- 
9:32 P.M. | In Speech, Romney Assails Obama for Lack of Leadership
Mr. Romney claimed an "extraordinary victory" in Illinois on Tuesday night and quickly attacked Mr. Obama for a lack of leadership during the past several years.
"It's time to say this word: enough," he told an enthusiastic crowd in Schaumburg, Ill. "We've had enough. We deserve in a president who believes in us."
Mr. Romney briefly praised his rivals for waging a good fight, but quickly shifted his focus to the president and his own campaign plans for the fall. 
"This administration's assault on freedom has kept this so called recovery from meeting their projections, much less our expectations," Mr. Romney said.
Mr. Romney continued to accuse Mr. Obama of preventing energy production and of "an all-out assault on our freedom."
"Our economic freedom will be on the ballot," he said, looking past the primaries to the election against Mr. Obama. "I'm offering a real choice and a new beginning."

9:12 P.M. | Santorum Adviser Looks South to Louisiana
GETTYSBURG, Pa. - While Mr. Santorum's supporters here awaited the news that he had lost Illinois, John Brabender, his top strategist, chit-chatted with reporters.
Most of the questions put to him reflected some skepticism about Mr. Santorum's ability to win important states like Illinois, not to mention Michigan and Ohio.
Asked why Mr. Santorum could not win in moderate areas of some of these states, Mr. Brabender turned the question around and said he would ask why Mr. Romney had not won other areas, like the South, that represent the base of the Republican party.
"We're the only ones who have shown we can win not only in the middle states like Colorado and North Dakota but also in the South where Romney is having trouble," Mr. Brabender said. "People will see Louisiana is a very important state on Saturday."
Pressed further about Mr. Santorum's ability to win swing voters in suburban areas, Mr. Brabender finally said: "Look, we're not even to half-time yet. We've got to have two more states to get to halfway, so we'll get through tonight, get through Illinois. . . "
On a small television screen in the hotel ballroom here where Mr. Santorum is expected to speak shortly, CNN projected Mr. Santorum's loss in Illinois. People in the room showed little reaction to the news. They continued to stand by patiently, listening to John Philip Sousa marches playing over the sound system in an endless loop.
- 
8:55 P.M. | Romney Gathering Cheers Early Call in Race
SCHAUMBURG, Ill. - Mr. Romney's supporters were still filing into the large Marriott ballroom in this suburb of Chicago, but Fox News was ready to call the contest for the former governor of Massachusetts. With 3 percent reporting, the network declared Mr. Romney the winner of Tuesday night's primary.
A large cheer went up in the room, and a Romney supporter, gnawing on an unlit cigar and with a icy cup of beer in one hand, shook his free hand with faux joy. "Three percent!" he said, wandering back into the crowd.
Then, the Chicago blues band, which had been playing music all night started up again, as more supporters continued to arrive.
While Mr. Romney may have been declared the early winner, with 8 p.m. Central time approaching, two teleprompters stood on either side of the stage, still awaiting the candidate's arrival.
- 
8:43 P.M. | Romney Wins Illinois Primary
Mr. Romney won a commanding victory over Mr. Santorum in Illinois on Tuesday, providing new ammunition for his argument that the Republican nomination contest should quickly give way to a focus on defeating Mr. Obama.
Mr. Romney bested his chief rival among many types of voters, winning among men and women, and voters of all ages, the exit polls show. Mr. Romney drew the support of more moderate voters - as he has in the past - but also won among voters who said they were supportive of the Tea Party movement.
For Mr. Santorum, the loss was a missed opportunity to slow Mr. Romney's momentum. Mr. Santorum's victories have mostly come in the South, and Tuesday's primary was a moment that he could have used to demonstrate strength elsewhere.
Instead, Mr. Santorum failed to extend his appeal into groups that have tended to back Mr. Romney.
The results of the voting do not directly translate into an accumulation of delegates, however, thanks to a complicated allocation process in Illinois. But Mr. Romney will likely extend his large delegate lead over Mr. Santorum. 
In part, that's because Mr. Santorum failed to field full slates of delegates in some of the Congressional districts. The same thing happened to Mr. Santorum in Ohio, where Mr. Romney narrowly won the popular vote and extended his delegate lead.
Mr. Romney's campaign had long viewed Illinois as a good opportunity for its candidate. But polling a week ago suggested that the race between the two men was tight - within the margin of sampling error.
In the end, the electorate favored Mr. Romney in ways that it hadn't in previous contests. 
A third of the voters in Illinois called themselves strong supporters of the Tea Party movement, and they were closely divided between Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum. In some previous contests, Tea Party supporters tended to back Mr. Santorum. 
Although Mr. Romney won the Republican primaries in Ohio and Michigan, strong Tea Party supporters backed Mr. Santorum. 
Mr. Santorum was backed by almost half of very conservative voters, but there were fewer who described themselves that way than in some of the recent Southern primaries. Voters for whom it mattered a great deal that a candidate share their religious beliefs voted for Mr. Santorum; Catholics backed Mr. Romney. 
A third of voters described Mr. Santorum as too conservative; about 5 percent of those voters chose him. About 4 in 10 called Mr. Romney not conservative enough; still a fifth of them backed him anyway.
Part of Mr. Romney's strength on Tuesday came from well-educated, wealthy voters, much as it has in other contests this year.
In Illinois, voters with a college degree accounted for about half the voters on Tuesday, and half of them supported Mr. Romney. Less-educated voters were just about evenly divided between Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum. 
Similarly, voters with annual household incomes of $100,000 or more made up almost 40 percent of the voters, and more than half chose Mr. Romney. Voters with lower incomes were evenly divided between the two leading candidates.
- 
8:35 P.M. | Santorum Supporters Gather in Gettysburg
GETTYSBURG, Pa. - The formal hall in the historic Gettysburg Hotel here is filling up slowly with Santorum supporters, waiting for him to speak after the returns come in from the Illinois primary.
About 200 people are in the room, milling around while a muted sound system plays John Philip Sousa marches. More than 200 are outside waiting to get in, but that seems unlikely to happen as the room is full.
John Frey, 74, an electrician and Republican committeeman, is among those inside the hall, standing quietly as he waits to see Mr. Santorum. "I believe in the man," Mr. Frey said. "He stands up for the values of the American people."
A sign reading "Freedom" is hanging behind the podium at the front of the hall, highlighting one of Mr. Santorum's campaign themes. For the last few weeks, he has had a sign reading "Made in America," but freedom is the watchword of the day. A campaign news release explained the choice of Gettysburg for the primary from the Land of Lincoln by saying this is "where President Abraham Lincoln gave his most poignant and passionate defense of our Founder's vision of freedom."
Outside, about 200 protesters are riffing on the freedom theme.
"Freedom - Except for What Santorum Is Against!" read several signs in the throng.
Jen Miller, 49, who works in a nursing home in Johnstown, said she was here to protest Mr. Santorum because "he attacks women, health care and the 99 percent."
James Issermoyer, 33, a Civil War re-enactor in uniform, wandered through the crowd. He had been at the nearby battlefield, answering questions from tourists in a "living history" performance, when he saw the protestors and came to see what the fuss was about. He supports Mr. Paul but was more interested in talking about the Civil War than current events.
- 
8:20 P.M. | Adelson Continues to Finance Pro-Gingrich Group
Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino mogul, and his family gave another $5.5 million to the super PAC backing Mr. Gingrich in February, almost single-handedly financing his continuing bid for the White House.
Reports filed by Winning Our Future show that the group raised $5.75 million last month, nearly all from Mr. Adelson and his relatives. Aside from the Adelson family, there were 16 other contributors to the group.
The campaign finance reports show that the group spent nearly all of the money it had raised, leaving it with about $2.3 million in cash as March began.
Mr. Adelson's friendship with Mr. Gingrich, and the resulting largess, have been crucial to Mr. Gingrich's ability to compete against better-funded rivals.
That was made possible this year by new campaign rules which allow corporations and individuals to make unlimited contributions to super PACs. Mr. Adelson has said he appreciates Mr. Gingrich's positions as they relate to Israel.

8:12 P.M. | In Louisiana, Ad Spending Heats Up
Mr. Romney had a significant spending advantage in Illinois as he and his super PAC outspent Mr. Santorum and his allies by more than seven to one.
But Louisiana, which will hold the next Republican primary on Saturday, is a much more balanced picture.
According to new data from a Republican who monitors media spending, Mr. Santorum and the Red White and Blue Fund, the pro-Santorum super PAC, have committed nearly a half-million dollars to advertising on broadcast television, cable and radio there.
Mr. Romney has not yet set aside any money for advertising in Louisiana, the data show. But his super PAC, Restore Our Future, has put in nearly $600,000, making for a relatively level playing field on the air for the first time in a recent primary.
Also on the air in Louisiana is Winning Our Future, the pro-Gingrich super PAC, which is putting about $50,000 into cable ads.
Louisiana, like much of the South, will be a tough road for Mr. Romney. Republican voters there are more similar to those in nearby Alabama and Mississippi, which Mr. Romney lost last week, than they are to Illinois Republicans.
Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, carried Louisiana in 2008. Exit polls showed more than half the Republican electorate there identified themselves as very conservative, the constituency that has been the slowest to warm to Mr. Romney this year.

7:56 P.M. | Voters' Voices: Santorum Fails to Close the Deal
Judith and Michael Masoner are the bull's-eye of Mr. Santorum's target audience. Evangelical Methodists from the small downstate town of Marion, Ill., they drove about 10 miles to see him speak Saturday night in a high-school gymnasium. But the Masoners, both 65, left unconvinced.
Mrs. Masoner, a former teacher, liked Mr. Santorum. She found him "sincere," and had even donated money to his campaign. But she was concerned that he had become too closely associated with social issues, she explained as she sat in the Herrin High School cafeteria after Mr. Santorum's speech.
Her husband liked Ron Paul's fiscal conservatism and resistance to engaging in foreign conflict. Then again, Mr. Paul might want to withdraw from the world stage a bit too quickly, especially with the looming threat from Iran. A retired economics professor, Mr. Masoner is also skeptical of Mr. Paul's Austrian economic theories.
So, after three days of reflection, whose name will they mark as they walk into their precinct's voting booth, in a municipal shed near the baseball field?
"I'm going to vote for Ron Paul," Mr. Masoner said, "despite his problems."
One of those problems, Mr. Masoner said in follow-up phone interview on Tuesday, is that Mr. Paul can't win.
"I could possibly be criticized for being irresponsible to not choose between the others, and if I chose between the others, I'd probably choose Romney" because he would be fiscally responsible, he said. "But I'm not going to be responsible. I'm going to hopefully be an ideologue myself."
Mr. Santorum was also unable to seal the deal with Mrs. Masoner. Even though he was the only candidate to make it to their part of Illinois, she got to hear from Mr. Romney, too, through a conference call with Illinois voters on Sunday.
"I like the fact that he is well organized, and I think that if he's established as the candidate, he's ready to go," she said, adding that endorsements from business figures like Donald Trump had elevated her view of Mr. Romney.
Mrs. Masoner also disliked Mr. Santorum's talk over the weekend about Afghanistan.
He advocates "staying in Afghanistan until quote unquote we're finished," she said. "I'm not sure what that means. I thought we were finished."
One other factor that drove her from Mr. Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator: a pamphlet she received from Paul supporters at Mr. Santorum's own rally.
"It wasn't so much about Romney, but it was things that helped me decide against Rick," she said.
- 
7:43 P.M. | For Romney, a Low-Key Primary Day
CHICAGO - Primary days are usually calm affairs for Mr. Romney - often a morning stop by a polling station, and an election night speech - but even by his standards, Tuesday was especially low-key.
His only public event was a virtual Google Plus Hangout, moderated by Kevin Madden, a senior campaign adviser, and Mr. Romney also took a tour of Google's Chicago headquarters.
There, Mr. Romney commented on Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin's budget, saying he was "supportive" of the plan.
"It's a bold and exciting effort on his part and on the part of the Republicans, and it's very much consistent with what I put out earlier," Mr. Romney said. "I think it's amazing that we have a president who three and a half years in still hasn't put a proposal out that deals with entitlements. This president's dealing with entitlement reform - excuse me - this budget deals with entitlement reform, tax policy, which as you know is very similar to the one that I put out and efforts to reign in excessive spending. I applaud it. It's an excellent piece of work and very much needed."
He also showed signs of confidence in Illinois, a state that had become a "must-win" for him after his losses to Mr. Santorum in Alabama and Mississippi last week; Mr. Romney cut short his trip to Puerto Rico to campaign here over the weekend. When asked by a reporter if he thought he would win Illinois, he replied, "Sure hope so."
After the Google Plus Hangout, where the campaign solicited questions about topics including China and gas prices using a #AskMitt hashtag, Jim Lecinski, a vice president at Google, gave Mr. Romney a tour of the engineering floor. Mr. Romney marveled at a wall decorated in paint-ball splatters, chatted with an Australian employee about the Olympic games in Sydney ("Fabulous," Mr. Romney said enthusiastically), and watched a demonstration by an ad employee on how Google links searches and ads.
The employee then showed him a search for meatloaf cakes, and the first returns were for a recipe for Ann Romney's meatloaf cakes - a birthday favorite of Mr. Romney.
"That's really funny," he said, laughing.
"I'd love to get a picture of Ann's meatloaf cakes," Mr. Romney added. "Oh, they look very different."
Walking by a large blue lava lamp on another employee's desk, Mr. Romney paused to make one of his favorite observations.
"That's a big lava lamp," he said. "Congratulations."

7:31 P.M. | Voters' Voices: Compromise Versus Principles
PALATINE, Ill. - Voters were slammed with the smell of chlorine as they walked into the Buehler YMCA in a northwest suburb of Chicago to cast their ballot.
Crammed in a small room, past the check-in counter and across the hall from the swimming pool, sat a line of voting booths and ballot counters for two local precincts.
"Mommy needs to vote after swim class, O.K.?" said Trish Abbey, 39, to her 3-year-old daughter, Lilly, as they walked through the front door.
Like most voters coming in and out of the YMCA Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Abbey said she planned to cast a Democratic ballot - a reminder that for Republican voters in Illinois, even in its more conservative suburban areas, the primary might be the only opportunity to have a say in picking the next president in a state that leans Democratic in general elections.
For election judges here, the day was not entirely without hiccups, albeit a minor one. Earlier, one of the machines had trouble reading the precinct number on ballots, volunteers said, forcing a small number of voters to start from scratch. It seemed to be working again in the afternoon.
For Republican voters, Mr. Romney appeared to be the candidate of choice, but as in other places around the state, there was also a whiff of compromise in the air.
"Out of all the candidates - although I don't like anyone - I had to vote for somebody," said Glenda Boecher, 56, who backed Mr. Romney. "I really wasn't impressed with the Republican Party, but out of everybody, I liked him the best."
Tim Pabst, 55, who supported Mr. Santorum, however, described the election as exciting and unlike any other he has voted in before. "It made you think a lot about what is this country about," he said. "Who are these people? Do they really care about me?"
And he was proud of his candidate. "You have to vote with what you believe in," he said, admitting that he thought Mr. Romney might win when polls close in Illinois. "Some people just go with the flow."
Still, election judges said turnout had been extremely low and described the day as "boring." They hoped it would pick up as more people got off work - or at least out of swim class.

7:20 P.M. | Congressional Primaries Make Captivating Undercard
The highest-profile primary in Illinois on Tuesday may be between Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum, but a slew of interesting House primaries are also on the stove, many of them proxies for various political engagements around the country.
Redistricting has left Illinois with 18 House seats in 2012, one fewer than it has now, and, unlike many states in which Republicans control the process, Democrats have used their majority power to squeeze Republicans into tougher districts. Illinois is ground zero for Democrats seeking to regain control of the House; if their strongest candidates emerge from primary contests Tuesday night, there are nearly a half-dozen opportunities in the state. But Republicans are ready to fight.
Two races will provide a test for the prowess of an emerging super PAC that seeks to pick off incumbents from both parties. The group, Campaign for Primary Accountability, which helped to unseat Representative Jean Schmidt of Ohio last week in her Republican primary race, has put its money behind the freshman Adam Kinzinger in a Republican primary against Representative Donald Manzullo, who has served in the House for two decades.
The group is also seeking to bounce Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. from his Chicago-area seat by supporting another Democrat, former Representative Debbie Halvorson, who lost her suburban seat to Mr. Kinzinger in 2010.

7:15 P.M. | Exit Polls: Race Is Not Wearing on Voters
The Republican nominating contest doesn't appear to be wearing that much on Illinois primary voters, with preliminary exit polls showing most would prefer that their candidate win, even if the race continues for months.
Nearly 7 in 10 voters said so, while 3 in 10 said they wanted the race to end as soon as possible, even if their candidate lost the nomination.
Still, Illinois voters, like in many other states so far, are not highly enthused about their candidates. Nearly half of voters said they strongly favored their candidate. That's similar to several of the previous contests, including Arizona, Michigan and Tennessee. 
In the contests so far, voters in Iowa, Oklahoma and Alabama have been the most enthusiastic about their candidate, with about 6 in 10 in each state strongly favoring him.

7:06 P.M. | Exit Polls: Ads Didn't Move Voters
The effort to woo Illinois voters has been intense. Mr. Romney, Mr. Santorum and their allies poured millions of dollars into ads that have bombarded the state's voters in the past week.
The response from voters? Eh.
Nearly 6 in 10 Republican primary voters said that campaign advertising was only a minor factor or not a factor at all in their vote, according to early exit poll results.
If true, that means that many of the voters ignored the accusation made in television ads for Mr. Romney that Mr. Santorum was an "economic lightweight." And they may have ignored Mr. Santorum's ads, questioning the wisdom of nominating Mr. Romney given his record on health care.
One factor that may help explain why the voters didn't think the ads mattered: Many said they had made up their minds before the ads began running in earnest.
Just about a third of voters said they had made up their minds in the past few days. Nearly 3 in 10 said they had decided this month, and 4 in 10 voters said their minds had been made up before then.
- 
6:57 P.M. | Santorum's February Fund-Raising Numbers
Mr. Santorum raised $9 million in February and spent $7.8 million as the Republican presidential contest narrowed to a battle with Mr. Romney for the nomination, according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday night.
Mr. Santorum entered March with nearly $2.6 million in cash as the fight for votes and delegates continued. On Tuesday, voters in Illinois cast ballots as Mr. Santorum prepared to move next to a contest in Louisiana.
Mr. Romney's campaign and his allies have far outspent Mr. Santorum in the past several weeks; voters in Illinois and other states have been bombarded by negative ads about Mr. Santorum's record.
But the campaign finance report filed by Mr. Santorum shows that he has stepped up his fund-raising considerably as he has become the chief alternative to Mr. Romney among the Republican contenders.
More than half of Mr. Santorum's contributions were less than $200 each, suggesting that his campaign is generating support from small-dollar donors who see him as a viable choice to run against Mr. Obama in the fall.
But the reports suggest that Mr. Santorum is having to burn through much of his cash in his challenge to Mr. Romney. The two men have received help from "super PACs" who are backing their campaigns.

6:36 P.M. | Political Geography: Illinois
As FiveThirtyEight has discussed, the political and cultural divide between the Chicago area and the rest of Illinois is stark.
In the state's Republican primary on Tuesday, Mr. Romney should excel in Cook County, where Chicago is located, and in the five "collar counties" that surround it. Mr. Santorum will find more support in the rest of the state, particularly in the south. The turnout will determine whether Mr. Santorum has a chance - or how big Mr. Romney's margin will be, since the polls have tipped in his direction.
To get a more detailed sense of Illinois's political landscape, FiveThirtyEight spoke to Paul Green, the director of the Institute for Politics at Roosevelt University and a political analyst for WGN Radio.

6:08 P.M. | Exit Polls: Romney More Electable Than Empathetic
Voters in Illinois - as in several other states - still consider Mr. Romney to be a candidate who is far more electable than one who understands their everyday problems. 
Mr. Romney has often been criticized for being unable to connect with voters or as being out of touch with their daily lives, especially among working-class voters. And that weakness has been highlighted in recent months as his rival, Mr. Santorum, gained in popularity and now often scores higher than Mr. Romney on the question of who best relates to voters. 
In Illinois, about a third of voters said Mr. Romney best understood the problems of average Americans, while slightly fewer voters said the same of Mr. Santorum, in preliminary exit polls. 
That's better than Mr. Romney has scored on this question in some recent contests. In Ohio, for example, 22 percent cited Mr. Romney as the most empathetic candidate. 
The preliminary exit poll results show that nearly 4 in 10 primary voters said the quality that mattered most was the candidate's ability to defeat Mr. Obama, more than those who wanted a candidate who was a true conservative, had a strong moral character or had the right experience.
Throughout the cycle, Mr. Romney has typically done well among voters who cared most about electability.
In last week's contests in Alabama and Mississippi, Mr. Santorum ranked highest among those looking for a true conservative or someone with strong moral character, while Newt Gingrich won most voters who were looking for an experienced candidate.
When Tuesday's voters were asked which candidate they thought had the best chance of winning in November, about 6 in 10 said Mr. Romney.
- 
6:02 P.M. | Illinois's Dark Economic Landscape
 It is the Land of Lincoln, the first Republican president. It is the Land of Obama, the Democratic incumbent. But Illinois, where Republican primary voters went to the polls on Tuesday, has another, less happy claim to fame these days: it is the Land of Budget Crisis.
 For several years now, the state has been unable to pay its bills on time. In January, the state comptroller's office said that it had a backlog of $4.2 billion in unpaid bills, and that the true cost of the backlog, when other obligations were factored in, might be twice that amount. The comptroller noted that the state spent $5.15 billion this year paying last year's bills.
The state's pension plans are only 43 percent funded, and in recent years, the state has borrowed money by selling bonds to make its annual contribution to its pension funds - money that must be repaid, with interest. The state has increased taxes and cut costs, but it still has many more hard choices to make.
In the budget proposal released last month by Mr. Quinn, the state's Democratic governor, a summary noted: "Since Governor Pat Quinn took office, the term 'budget crisis' has become clich. Yet its import should not be diminished. Each year, the state has faced seemingly insurmountable hurdles. Additionally, the nation persists in its protracted emergence from the recession, with unemployment unacceptably high.''
The section's headline? "It Doesn't Get Any Easier."

5:54 P.M. | Exit Polls: Smaller Proportion of Conservative Voters
About one in four Illinois voters described themselves as "very conservative," according to early exit poll results, making them a smaller part of the state's electorate than in places like Alabama and Mississippi.
That could be an indication of problems for Mr. Santorum, who has won big among "very conservative" voters in past primaries. Those margins have helped Mr. Santorum defeat Mr. Romney in Southern states. (Interactive: Exit polls.)
But if the early exit poll results hold, there may not be enough of those voters to overcome Mr. Romney's traditional strength among other voting groups. 
In Mississippi, 42 percent of the voters described themselves as "very conservative." In Alabama, it was 35 percent. In both states, Mr. Santorum bested Mr. Romney among those groups by double-digits.
The same trend is apparent among voters who said they were born-again or evangelical Christians. About half described themselves that way in Illinois on Tuesday. That compares to 82 percent who said they were evangelical Christians in Mississippi.
Mr. Santorum's challenge going into Tuesday's voting was to demonstrate that he could do well among voting groups that have tended to go Mr. Romney's way, including wealthy voters, moderates, highly educated voters and those who say defeating Mr. Obama is the most important issue to them.
If the exit polls are right, Mr. Santorum will have to really do well among those groups because his own voter base is a smaller proportion of the vote in Illinois.
In addition, Mr. Romney appears to be doing better in Illinois among groups with which he has struggled in the past.
More than 4 in 10 Illinois primary voters in preliminary exit polls said Mr. Romney's positions on the issues were about right, many more than said so last week in Alabama (27 percent) or Mississippi (32 percent). About half of voters in last week's primaries said Mr. Romney's positions were not conservative enough; fewer said so on Tuesday.
Nearly half of voters in Illinois said Mr. Santorum's positions were about right. But about a third called them too conservative - many more than had said so in Alabama or Mississippi. 
- 
5:25 P.M. | Exit Polls: Economy Matters Most
The economy was the No. 1 issue to voters in Illinois on Tuesday, as it has been for voters in all state primaries which have had exit polls so far.
Despite Mr. Santorum's saying that unemployment or economic growth rates won't matter to his campaign, a majority of Republican primary voters in Illinois said the economy mattered most in their deciding how to vote. 
About 1 in 4 voters said the budget deficit mattered most, and about 1 in 10 said abortion, according to early exit poll results.
Since the state has the highest unemployment rate in the Midwest, a high number of foreclosures and several years of state budget woes, it's easy to understand the dour economic mood of Illinois voters on Tuesday. Just one in five said the nation's economy was starting to recover, while about 8 in 10 said it was getting worse or staying the same.
Illinois's unemployment rate was 9.4 percent for January 2012, above the national average of 8.3 percent, but down from a peak of 11.4 percent in January 2010.
The state has had severe budget deficits to overcome in recent years. In January 2011, in order to deal with a $13 billion budget deficit, Illinois lawmakers passed an individual income tax rate increase of about 66 percent, and a business tax increase of about 46 percent. 
This year, Gov. Pat Quinn, a Democrat, has proposed major spending cuts, including a 9 percent budget cut across all state departments, eliminating two prisons and 60 state offices, laying off more than 1,100 workers, to save $88.9 million.

5:13 P.M. | Ballot Problems in Some Illinois Precincts
Some of the printed ballots in 25 of 110 Illinois jurisdictions were slightly too wide to fit into the optical scanners and will have to be trimmed or hand counted, officials said Tuesday afternoon.
Voters are choosing a Republican presidential nominee and making decisions in Congressional primaries. Turnout appeared to be light, officials said. But the ballot problem threatened to slow the results from some parts of the state Tuesday night.
Officials quickly began noticing on Tuesday that some of the ballots filled out by voters did not fit into the scanner - they were too wide, according to Ken Menzel, the deputy general counsel for the Illinois elections board.
Mr. Menzel said it was unclear how many ballots were affected. At precincts in the affected counties, some ballots seemed to fit, and some did not, he said. He said it appeared that the ballots were cut unevenly by the vendors who had printed them.
"Anything that goes wrong on election day is a Maalox moment," Mr. Menzel said.
But he said that no votes had been lost and that all of the votes would be counted - eventually.
Election officials said the precinct leaders would try to trim the too-wide ballots to get them to fit through the scanner. If that doesn't work, a ballot can be "remade" under Illinois rules. In that case, a new ballot is filled out as a duplicate of the damaged one under bipartisan supervision at the precinct.

4:58 P.M. | Illinois Votes in Rare Turn in Spotlight
PEORIA, Ill. - The contest in Illinois has largely come down to a battle between Mitt Romney, who leads in delegates, and Rick Santorum, and in recent days, the two have campaigned furiously across the state. For Mr. Romney, the primary is a chance to further cement the notion that he is the inevitable nominee; for Mr. Santorum, a strong showing here could show the breadth of his appeal beyond evangelical voters. But polls show Mr. Romney with an edge, and he is considered likely to carry the majority of the state's 69 delegates because Mr. Santorum did not have delegate slates in four of the state's 19 Congressional districts.
Such national attention is rare for Illinois Republicans. The state, home to President Obama, is typically a Democratic stronghold in presidential general elections, and often the Republican Party's candidate has already been decided in earlier primaries by the time voters here get a chance to weigh in.

HEADLINE: Analyzing the Illinois Exit Polls

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the Illinois exit polls: Illinois voters were less conservative, and they cared about the economy, despite implications by Rick Santorum.

The Times's polling unit is combing through the exit polls of voters leaving the Illinois primaries for insights. This post will be updated as we crunch numbers throughout the night.

HEADLINE: In Speech, Romney Assails Obama for Lack of Leadership

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney claimed an "extraordinary victory" in Illinois on Tuesday night and quickly attacked President Obama for a lack of leadership during the past several years. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney claimed an "extraordinary victory" in Illinois on Tuesday night and quickly attacked President Obama for a lack of leadership during the past several years.
"It's time to say this word: enough," he told an enthusiastic crowd in Schaumburg, Ill. "We've had enough. We deserve in a president who believes in us."
Mr. Romney briefly praised his rivals for waging a good fight, but quickly shifted his focus to the president and his own campaign plans for the fall.
"This administration's assault on freedom has kept this so called recovery from meeting their projections, much less our expectations," Mr. Romney said.
Mr. Romney continued to accuse Mr. Obama of preventing energy production and of "an all-out assault on our freedom."
"Our economic freedom will be on the ballot," he said, looking past the primaries to the election against Mr. Obama. "I'm offering a real choice and a new beginning."

HEADLINE: Gingrich Says He Will Stay in Race and Stop Romney

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Having skipped campaigning in Illinois, Newt Gingrich said he was staying in the race because he believes voters would choose him as the nominee after rejecting Mitt Romney. 

 BODY:
Newt Gingrich said Tuesday night that "phase one" for himself and Rick Santorum in the days ahead must be stopping Mitt Romney from getting enough delegates to claim the Republican presidential nomination.
Having skipped campaigning in Illinois and faced with mounting campaign debts, Mr. Gingrich said on Fox News that he was staying in the race because he believes voters would choose him as the nominee after rejecting Mr. Romney.
If Mr. Romney fails to get the 1,144 delegates he needs to wrap up the nomination, Mr. Gingrich said that "then we'll have a real conversation about who can best beat Barack Obama."
Mr. Gingrich said that he believes voters would turn to him as the best person to debate Mr. Obama in the fall. He said his repeated discussion about the need to produce more energy in the United States was putting Mr. Obama on the defensive.
"If the key is who can stand here and take him on head to head, I think I'm proving every day," Mr. Gingrich said. "He is losing this argument over expensive gasoline."

HEADLINE: Despite Illinois Loss, Santorum Rallies Forces at Gettysburg

BYLINE: KATHARINE Q. SEELYE


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Santorum delivered his own Gettysburg address twice Tuesday night after he lost the Illinois primary in a blowout to Mitt Romney. 

 BODY:
GETTYSBURG, Pa. -- Rick Santorum delivered his own Gettysburg address twice Tuesday night after he lost the Illinois primary in a blowout to Mitt Romney.
His campaign had set up in a main ballroom here at the Gettysburg Hotel that could hold about 200 people, but many more came to see him.
Instead of one speech in a big room to everyone at once, with all the cameras rolling, he first gave his speech to one crowd as he stood in a hotel hallway.
He then moved into the main ballroom. Noting that Abraham Lincoln had put the finishing touches on his Gettysburg Address at a spot nearby, Mr. Santorum said this was "the most important election since the election of 1860."
He said his campaign boiled down to "freedom," a word that hung on a banner behind him at the podium. "While other issues are certainly important," he said, mentioning the economy, joblessness, national security, the family and life, the "foundational" issue was freedom.
He jabbed at President Obama's health care overhaul, which has become his chief object lesson when he talks about freedom being threatened. Under that health care law, he said, "every single American will depend on the federal government," adding, "that's why this election is so important.
He scoffed at those with "Wall Street experience" but did not much dwell on either Mr. Romney or Mr. Obama. Rather, he played heavily on his blue-collar roots and that he grew up in a steel town in western Pennsylvania where, he said, he saw "how people scraped and clawed" their way to success.
Scraping and clawing is a phrase he uses often, usually in reference to his own campaign. Tuesday night he said that no one was talking about the people who, he said, wear "work clothes."
It was at this point in his speech, at least 10 minutes into it, that he mentioned he was starting his campaign in Pennsylvania. "We have five weeks to a big win," he said of the April 24 primary, and he returned again to his parents and grandparents who worked in the mines, "men and women who worked and scraped and clawed so their children could have a better quality of life."
"They fought for the things that the people of this battlefield just down the road fought for," he said of his family. "They fought for big things, things that America has always stood for."
He said he understood "what was sacrificed in the mills and on the battlefields and that's why we must go out and fight this fight," and nominate him for president.
"You know in your gut big things are adrift and at stake in this election," he concluded. He asked everyone to "saddle up," and said he would be back to Pennsylvania where, he said, "we're going to pick up a whole boatload of delegates and close this gap."

 BODY:
KAUFMAN--Melvyn, 87, of Mamaroneck, died peacefully at his home with his wife Liz at his side on Sunday March 18, 2012. Beloved husband of Elizabeth H. Atwood. He was born to the late William and Esther Kaufman, (d. respectively 1976 and 1984). His older brother, Bennett, who died in 1980, predeceased him. His younger brother, Robert, survives him. 
Together with his brother, Robert, they advanced The William Kaufman Organization and Sage Realty Corporation, started by their father William, to the level of one of most respected and honored real estate ventures in New York City and the entire country. As a young man Melvyn learned the construction business "the hard way", by working for his father as a day laborer. lt was from this early experience that he realized that he had found his true love - architecture and construction. Melvyn attended New York University and Long Island University. This was interrupted by his military service as an infantry soldier in Europe in World War II. After the war ended Melvyn did not return to school. Instead, he went to work for his father. He started his career as a builder of shopping centers and small commercial buildings, but the company's and his attention soon turned to bigger things in the booming postwar economy of New York City -the high rise office building. In the early 1950's WKO built its' First New York City buildings, 711 Third Avenue and 405 Park Avenue. Several years later 777 Third Avenue followed and over the next several decades continued to develop large New York City office building projects. These include 437 Madison Avenue, 767 Third Avenue, 747 Third Avenue, 127 John Street, 77 Water Street and 17 State Street. Melvyn was a guest professor at Cooper Union and at Pratt School of Architecture. He lectured at McGill University, Ohio University, New York University and many other architectural schools. He spoke before the American Institute of Architects and the Architectural League of New York. Melvyn was Chairman of the Stoneyard Institute of The Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City. His first wife and mother of their children, Claire, who died in 1987, predeceased Melvyn. Melvyn is survived by three children: Jerian Franco and Kim Kaufman, of New York City and Karin Kaufman of Pound Ridge. Four grandchildren also survive him: Samantha, Daniel, William and James. Two stepchildren survive Melvyn: Richard Metz Jr. of New York City and Jane Robinson of West Hartford, CT. He is also survived by three step-grandchildren: Courtney, John, and Thomas. Many nieces and nephews as well as many great-nieces and great-nephews also survive Melvyn. ln lieu of flowers, the family is requesting that donations be made out to Berwick Boys Foundation, 335 West Street, West Bridgewater, MA 02379 or www.berwick.org. Family will be receiving friends at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Avenue New York, NY 10028, Wednesday March 21, 2012 3pm-5pm and 7pm-9pm.

HEADLINE: U.S. Stores Learn How to Ship to Foreign Shoppers

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Macy's has long marketed itself as a shopping destination for visitors to the United States. It offers a savings card with a 10 percent discount for foreign shoppers, custom programs for tour groups and travel agents, and a tourism Web site that lists shopping events and recommended hotels near Macy's flagship stores.
But only last year did Macys.com -- which shoppers worldwide can look at -- offer overseas shipping. 
''We were getting international traffic,'' said Kent Anderson, president of Macys.com. ''It was coming whether we were offering them, frankly, any realistic way to interact with the site or not.''
Macy's is one of several retailers trying to extend its international presence to its Web operations by shipping overseas. In the last year, Williams-Sonoma, J. Crew, Aeropostale, Crate and Barrel and Lane Bryant have added international shipping to their Web sites, while Ann Taylor and Neiman Marcus are working on it.
Some of the retailers are meeting existing or anticipated overseas demand, while others are testing the waters before opening stores in other countries. Either way, they are discovering that shipping beyond the United States is not a simple undertaking.
''Typically the guys we're talking to start off thinking they can toss it in a box and give it to U.P.S. or FedEx and hope it gets there,'' said Michael DeSimone, chief executive of FiftyOne, a technology company that helps retailers add international shipping capabilities.
But there are problems with ordering systems, customs and postal fees, he said.
For example, many retailers do not have software in their warehouse management systems that recognizes foreign postal codes, which -- unlike those in the United States -- do not always have five digits.
''It sounds like a really stupid reason not to sell internationally,'' Mr. DeSimone said, ''but I can't tell you how many times I've heard this was the biggest roadblock.''
The appeal to reaching customers in other countries is based largely on the popularity of mobile phone sales overseas. Forrester Research expects online retail sales in the Western Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America regions to increase 67 percent from 2011 to 2015, compared with 42 percent for the United States.
And traffic to American Web sites from international visitors is already high. In December, 14 percent of visitors to jcrew.com were from outside the United States, as were 36 percent of visitors to abercrombie.com, according to the research firm comScore.
''The retailers have been looking for new avenues of growth beyond the U.S.,'' said John D. Morris, a retail analyst with BMO Capital Markets. A handful of retailers have sold internationally for some time. Abercrombie & Fitch, for instance, has shipped to overseas consumers for about a decade, while Nordstrom began doing so in 2009.
International visitors are coming to American sites because of lower prices and the availability of products they cannot get in their own countries, according to Forrester. Macy's has found that Australian shoppers are particularly interested in its trendy clothes, while Canadians want basics like coats, shoes and underwear.
Some smaller retailers are handing over global shipping to third-party vendors like International Checkout. On those sites, shoppers click to transfer their shopping carts from merchants like Jockey and Bebe to International Checkout, which handles shipping, labeling and customs.
The customs piece of it can be substantial. Each item shipped overseas has to be labeled with information like country of origin and materials used. And certain products cannot go to certain nations -- Spain, for instance, forbids imported playing cards, according to FiftyOne, while to send an alligator purse to someone outside the United States, retailers need a Fish and Wildlife Service permit.
Delivery, meanwhile, could cost as much as the product itself. Macy's said that it could cost $200 to send $100 worth of merchandise to Australia after adding shipping costs and the value-added tax.
The Macy's Web site will soon detect the location of international visitors, and show them a welcome screen in the local language that explains how international shopping and shipping works. After the welcome screen, the shoppers browse the English-language site used by shoppers in the United States, but at checkout they get a final price, plus shipping costs, in their local currency.
Macy's said it was still learning how best to reach its overseas customers. The retailer's standard one-day sales, a popular promotion in the United States, ''seem to be understood across the English-speaking world, at least,'' according to Mr. Anderson. But, he said, Macy's was looking into how to capitalize on country-specific promotions.
''We need to pay more attention to Boxing Day,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Generic Drugs Prove Resistant to Damage Suits

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
Debbie Schork, a deli worker at a supermarket in Indiana, had to have her hand amputated after an emergency room nurse injected her with an anti-nausea drug, causing gangrene. She sued the manufacturer named in the hospital's records for failing to warn about the risks of injecting it. Her case was quietly thrown out of court last fall.
That result stands in sharp contrast to the highly publicized case of Diana Levine, a professional musician from Vermont. Her hand and forearm were amputated because of gangrene after a physician assistant at a health clinic injected her with the same drug. She sued the drug maker, Wyeth, and won $6.8 million.
The financial outcomes were radically different for one reason: Ms. Schork had received the generic version of the drug, known as promethazine, while Ms. Levine had been given the brand name, Phenergan. 
''Explain the difference between the generic and the real one -- it's just a different company making the same thing,'' Ms. Schork said.
Across the country, dozens of lawsuits against generic pharmaceutical companies are being dismissed because of a Supreme Court decision last year that said the companies did not have control over what their labels said and therefore could not be sued for failing to alert patients about the risks of taking their drugs.
Now, what once seemed like a trivial detail -- whether to take a generic or brand-name drug -- has become the deciding factor in whether a patient can seek legal recourse from a drug company. The cases range from that of Ms. Schork, who wasn't told which type of drug she had been given when she visited the hospital, to people like Camille Baruch, who developed a gastrointestinal disease after taking a generic form of the drug Accutane, as required by her health care plan.
''Your pharmacists aren't telling you, hey, when we fill this with your generic, you are giving up all of your legal remedies,'' said Michael Johnson, a lawyer who represented Gladys Mensing, one of the patients who sued generic drug companies in last year's Supreme Court case, Pliva v. Mensing. ''You have a disparate impact between one class of people and another.''
The Supreme Court ruling affects potentially millions of people: nearly 80 percent of prescriptions in the United States are filled by a generic, and most states permit pharmacists to dispense a generic in place of a brand name. More than 40 judges have dismissed cases against generic manufacturers since the Supreme Court ruled last June, including some who dismissed dozens of cases consolidated under one judge.
Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, has petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to give generic companies greater control over their labels, a rule change that could allow users of generic drugs to sue, but the agency said earlier this month that it needed more time to decide. ''Congress can make this problem go away, and the F.D.A. could, too,'' said Allison Zieve, the director of Public Citizen Litigation Group. ''But we haven't seen signs that either of them is paying much attention.'' A spokeswoman for the F.D.A. declined to comment.
The Supreme Court's ruling, which was split 5 to 4 on ideological lines, has its roots in the Hatch-Waxman Act, the 1984 law that opened the floodgates to generic drugs. That law allowed companies to skip the lengthy process required to approve new drugs if they could prove that the generic drug was equivalent to its brand-name counterpart.
With few exceptions, it also required generic manufacturers to use the same labels -- the lengthy list of a drug's uses, dosages and risks -- used by the brand names.
If a problem develops, the brand-name companies are responsible for changing the label, and the generic companies must follow their lead. As a result, the court's majority ruled, generic companies cannot be held responsible for failing to alert patients to problems with their drug. The dissent, which was written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, argued that generic companies nevertheless have a responsibility to report problems to the F.D.A. and should be held liable for failing to warn patients.
The ruling came just two years after the Supreme Court established -- in Ms. Levine's case -- that, by contrast, brand-name companies can be sued for failing to adequately warn patients.
Ms. Levine was given an injection of Phenergan in 2000 during a visit to a clinic to treat a migraine headache. Her hand and forearm turned black and eventually had to be amputated. Reports had shown that the drug can cause gangrene if it enters an artery, especially if it is placed directly into the vein rather than injected into the muscle or through a diluted intravenous drip. Although the label warned that gangrene could occur if the drug came into contact with arterial blood, Levine argued that the warning did not go far enough.
She sued Wyeth and a Vermont jury awarded her $6.8 million. Wyeth appealed and the Supreme Court sided with Ms. Levine, agreeing that the company could be held liable for failing to adequately warn about the risks of a drug.
Ms. Schork, 52, was given the generic version of Phenergan when she visited the hospital in 2007 with a stomachache and nausea related to her diagnosis of Crohn's disease.
When a nurse injected the drug into her arm, it entered her artery, and Ms. Schork's right hand developed gangrene. In asking that the case be dismissed, lawyers for Baxter Healthcare Corporation, which then was one of several companies that made the drug but has since sold its injectable generics to another company, argued that Ms. Schork could not conclusively prove that Baxter had made the drug she took.
The judge agreed that the question could be debated at trial but said it was irrelevant because of the Supreme Court's ruling.
Ms. Schork filed a malpractice claim against the hospital with the Indiana Department of Insurance, and received what her lawyer described as a limited award; the amount was confidential. She said she could not continue to work at her supermarket job and is now unemployed.
Soon after Ms. Levine won her case, Ms. Schork wrote to congratulate her and to share her own story. At the bottom of the letter, Ms. Levine recalled, Ms. Schork apologized for her handwriting because she was writing with her left hand. ''The fact that it had happened to her and she had this same struggle -- and then to hear now that it's getting dismissed -- is just beyond me,'' said Ms. Levine.
Ms. Schork said she and Ms. Levine later spoke on the telephone. ''I'm glad for her,'' she said, ''but it didn't help me any.''
Lawyers for generic drug companies say their clients are able to provide low-cost drugs because their primary task is replicating drugs. If the companies were expected to take responsibility for updating their labels, ''we would effectively start to turn generic companies into brand companies, and of course the tremendous cost savings that American consumers have benefitted from would start to wane,'' said Jay Lefkowitz, who served as the lead attorney representing generic companies before the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court recognized that its decision must make ''little sense'' to plaintiffs who sue generic drug companies. However, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the court, ''Congress and the F.D.A. retain the authority to change the law and regulations if they so desire.''
Some attorneys who follow the issue have speculated that Congress and the F.D.A. are reluctant to deal a blow to generic companies, which are responsible for providing cheap drugs to millions of American consumers, especially in an election year when health care is a hot issue.
In a statement last week, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, who co-wrote the Hatch-Waxman Act, said he was exploring ways to address the issue, either through legislation or a rule change.
Mr. Waxman argued in a brief opposing the generic companies in the Supreme Court case last year that Congress had never intended for generic companies to be freed of all responsibility. ''Congress did not intend for consumers' rights to be categorically eliminated simply because they purchased a generic rather than a brand-name drug,'' he wrote.
Camille Baruch, 18, and her family say that is precisely what happened to her. When she was 12, Camille, of Rockville, Md., began taking the generic version of the antiacne drug Accutane and developed severe gastrointestinal pain several months later. Her diagnosis was ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease, and she had to have her large intestine removed.
Six years and eight operations later, doctors have not been able to stabilize her condition. Her parents said the disease transformed their daughter from a talented basketball and softball athlete to someone who will struggle with debilitating physical challenges for the rest of her life.
Thousands of patients have sued Roche, the maker of Accutane, claiming that it caused their inflammatory bowel disease, and several have won multimillion-dollar verdicts against the company. In 2009, citing litigation costs and competition from generics, Roche removed Accutane from the market. In 2010, Camille sued the makers of the three generic versions of Accutane she took. Her lawyer, Tayjes Shah, said lawyers for the companies have told him they intend to ask for a dismissal. ''I have very little optimism,'' Mr. Shah said.
Camille, who was in the hospital this month recovering from another operation, said she had heard the arguments that the generic companies had made. ''It makes me almost want to cry every time that I think that I took something that is nearly identical'' to Accutane, yet she cannot sue, she said. ''I lost everything. That is not a reason enough that these people aren't to blame.''

HEADLINE: As Reactors Age, the Money to Close Them Lags

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The operators of 20 of the nation's aging nuclear reactors, including some whose licenses expire soon, have not saved nearly enough money for prompt and proper dismantling. If it turns out that they must close, the owners intend to let them sit like industrial relics for 20 to 60 years or even longer while interest accrues in the reactors' retirement accounts.
Decommissioning a reactor is a painstaking and expensive process that involves taking down huge structures and transporting the radioactive materials to the few sites around the country that can bury them. The cost is projected at $400 million to $1 billion per reactor, which in some cases is more than what it cost to build the plants in the 1960s and '70s.
Mothballing the plants makes hundreds of acres of prime industrial land unavailable for decades and leaves open the possibility that radioactive contamination in the structures could spread. While the radioactivity levels decline over time, many communities worry about safe oversight. 
Bills that once seemed far into the future may be coming due. The license for Vermont Yankee in Vernon, Vt., at 40 the nation's oldest reactor, expires on Wednesday, for example. And while the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has granted its owner, Entergy, a new 20-year permit, the State of Vermont is trying to close the plant.
In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has vowed to force the two operating reactors at another Entergy plant, Indian Point, 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, to shut down when their licenses expire in 2013 and 2015 by denying them state environmental permits.
Entergy is at least $90 million short of the projected $560 million cost of dismantling Vermont Yankee; the company is at least $500 million short of the $1.5 billion estimated cost of dismantling Indian Point 2 and 3.
The shortfall raises the possibility that Vermont could tend one sleeping reactor for decades while New York oversees three; Unit 1 , another reactor at Indian Point, shut down in 1974 and has yet to be dismantled.
Even the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's chairman is uneasy about the prospect of a 60-year wait.
''These facilities should be cleaned up, and their footprints reduced as much as possible so that these areas can be returned to other productive uses within the community,'' the chairman, Gregory B. Jaczko, said recently.
Gil C. Quiniones, the president and chief executive of the New York Power Authority, a state utility that sold Indian Point 3 to Entergy in 2000, called Entergy's failure to plan for or finance the decommissioning of Indian Point in real time ''stunningly irresponsible.''
''Delaying action for 60 years -- when Entergy might no longer even exist -- is offensive to the communities of Westchester County and the people of New York,'' he said. James Steets, a spokesman for Entergy, said that financing would not be a problem because the company still expects to obtain new 20-year licenses for Units 2 and 3, which would allow time for savings to grow, and to prevail on the state permit issue.
Assuming that the plants remain open for two more decades, the company has promised Westchester County that it will decommission Indian Point in a ''reasonable'' period of time after the reactors close, probably in the 2030s.
Of the 20 reactors that lack the money for swift deconstruction, the owners hope that license renewals from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will make the problem go away. For the plants that are fighting with their host states, Indian Point and Vermont Yankee, the federal courts may have the final say on whether and how long they keep operating. (A large demonstration in favor of closing the plant is planned for Wednesday at Vermont Yankee.)
The remaining 84 active reactors have enough savings on hand to satisfy the commission's minimum financing requirements for eventual dismantling, some of them because they won license extensions.
The nuclear industry had been counting on steady returns on the funds and did not anticipate the 2008 market crash. Altogether the nation's 104 power reactors have about $40 billion on hand. ''A lot of decommissioning funds did take a hit at the nadir of the economic crisis,'' said Scott Burnell, a spokesman for the regulatory commission.
One plant, Palisades in western Michigan, had $597.6 million saved up at the end of 2006, but the account was down to $218.8 million two years later and was only $279.2 million by the end of 2010, the most recent figures show.
Bruce Biewald, an economist who specializes in electricity economics at Synapse Energy, a Boston consulting firm, said the mothball strategy carries risks that could outweigh benefits. Proponents say ''it's like magic -- compound interest on the one hand and radioactive decay on the other,'' he said. (Because radioactivity levels decline over time, deconstruction workers would ultimately be exposed to less contamination.) But future investment returns could prove bleak, Mr. Biewald warns, and anticipated deconstruction costs could easily rise.
Responding to a petition from Sherwood Martinelli, an antinuclear activist who lives near Indian Point, Dr. Jaczko, the regulatory commission chairman, sought a shorter period between closing and dismantling.
But in October, Dr. Jaczko (pronounced YAZZ-koh) was outvoted 4 to 1 by his fellow commissioners. And the commission's staff said that even 60 years was not a hard-and-fast outer time limit for suspending a reactor's operations.
In the industry, this status is known as Safstor and it usually involves putting the spent nuclear fuel into storage casks on site, draining many of the plant's fluids, making security arrangements and maintaining the reactor so it looks like a decent neighbor.
Environmental experts say the plants can be dangerous when they are not running. In a letter, the three members of Vermont's Congressional delegation pointed out that 55,000 gallons of contaminated water spilled out of a mothballed plant in Illinois after a pipe froze. An attentive night watchman was credited with catching the spill in time to contain it.
Indian Point 1 has leaked a variety of radioactive materials into the soil on the banks of the Hudson in the 38 years since it closed, a point acknowledged by Entergy, which responded by emptying a spent fuel pool that was the source of the problem. The environmental group Riverkeeper argues that this is a harbinger of further trouble if Units 2 and 3 enter Safstor.
Compounding the worries about radioactive materials, the nation still lacks a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel after decades of jockeying by politicians who sought to bar it from their backyards. So the fuel at the sleeping reactors will remain on site.
Twelve reactors across the country have been retired in the last three decades, all on short notice, because of a design or safety flaw that the economics did not justify fixing. The low price of natural gas, a competing fuel, makes the economic lifetime of existing reactors uncertain.
Some have been decommissioned in a few years, like Connecticut Yankee, whose owners, a group of New England utilities, footed the cost. Decommissioning started two years after its 1996 shutdown and was completed in 2005 at a cost of $871 million.
In Haddam, Conn., officials are still advertising for a new industrial tenant for its former site on the east bank of the Connecticut River.
Asked if tearing it down had been the right call, Paul J. DeStefano, the town's first selectman and top official, said, ''I'm a little hesitant, from a layman's standpoint, of having something sitting around for 60 years. It just doesn't sound right.''

HEADLINE: Software Licenses Help Oracle Beat Estimates

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Oracle, the biggest maker of database software, exceeded analysts' estimates for quarterly profit and new license sales on Tuesday, a sign of buoyant demand for programs that help companies organize data and run operations. 
New software license sales, a predictor of revenue growth, gained 7 percent to $2.37 billion in the company's fiscal third quarter, Oracle said. Analysts had projected 3 percent growth, according to Raimo Lenschow, an analyst at Barclays. Oracle's profit excluding certain one-time costs rose to 62 cents a share, topping 56 cents, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.
''I view this as a high-quality beat, and it certainly should be viewed as a positive catalyst'' for Oracle shares, Joel Levington, a managing director at Brookfield Investment Management in New York, said in an e-mail. ''The license number was about $100 million better than we expected.''
Net income at the company, based in Redwood City, Calif., totaled $2.5 billion, or 49 cents a share, in the quarter ended in February, an 18 percent increase from a year earlier. Overall revenue rose 3 percent, to $9 billion. Oracle rebounded from disappointing results in its fiscal second quarter by reorganizing its sales force, closing deals that were delayed and taking advantage of the improving economy, Mr. Lenschow said.
The company's profit in the current quarter, which ends in May, may also exceed analysts' expectations. In a conference call with investors and analysts, Oracle projected that its profit excluding one-time items would be 76 to 81 cents in the fiscal fourth quarter. Analysts projected 76 cents.
Oracle shares rose 1.5 percent in after-hours trading after the earnings report. They had gained 1.1 percent to $30.10 at the close in New York. That left them 17 percent higher since the beginning of the year.
Even as software sales rebounded, hardware sales fell more than analysts predicted as Oracle sacrificed volume for higher-margin products. The company bought the computer maker Sun Microsystems two years ago and has been emphasizing sales of large systems for data processing at the expense of Sun's less expensive gear.
Hardware systems sales declined 16 percent to $869 million. Analysts cited by Mr. Lenschow were projecting an 11 percent drop.
''They've got some work to do proving themselves to the market with this hardware business,'' Josh Olson, an analyst at Edward Jones & Company, said.
Oracle's database software is used by companies to store information and process customer transactions. Oracle is also the second-largest maker of business applications used to manage financials, operations and human resources, after SAP.

HEADLINE: China Eases Its Controls On Capital

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The Chinese government has begun making it much easier for foreign investors to put money into China's stock market and other financial investments, in a slight relaxing of more than a decade of tight capital controls.
The move, not publicly announced but disclosed by some private money managers, indicates that Chinese officials are eager to counter a rising flight of capital from the country, a worsening slump in real estate prices, a weak stock market and at least a temporary trade deficit caused by a steep bill for oil imports.
Those concerns have evidently started to offset fears of the potentially inflationary effects of big inflows of foreign cash.
Chinese securities officials made a series of phone calls to top fund managers outside China late last week telling them of the relaxation of the capital restrictions, according to several money managers. 
But if the fund managers wanted to increase their requested allotments for investing in China, they were told they would have to answer almost immediately -- a sign of the government's haste to come up with a plan to reassure financial markets.
''It literally was phone calls coming in at 4 and you had to give an answer by 5:30,'' said the chairman of a financial company heavily invested in China. He insisted on anonymity to avoid offending regulators.
Easing the path of foreign money into China could help offset a nascent exodus of investment money there and stem the recent weakness of China's currency, the renminbi. The renminbi's weakness is making Chinese manufacturers even more competitive in foreign markets.
Investment executives say officials at the China Securities Regulatory Commission, in coordination with foreign-exchange officials, informed them in the phone calls last week that the government would approve all of their past requests to increase certain types of foreign investments and would even let them double their total invested.
The range of financial institutions with so-called Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor rights in China include big banks like Goldman Sachs and endowment funds like Yale University's.
Regulators indicated that they would roughly double the overall cap on all foreign investments to about $60 billion, one money manager said; the cap has been $30 billion for several years. Until now, Chinese regulators have dribbled out each increase in authorized foreign investment, a few hundred million dollars at a time.
While still a tiny amount, compared with the combined value of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets or relative to the volume of China's international trade, raising the foreign investment cap is the latest signal that Beijing is worried about a potentially prolonged weakness in the renminbi.
The issue is politically volatile in Washington, where Democrats and Republicans alike have been calling for a stronger Chinese currency as a way to limit China's large bilateral trade surplus with the United States.
The American Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, complained at a Congressional hearing on Tuesday that China still had ''some ways to go'' in allowing its currency to appreciate against the currencies of China's main trading partners.
Allowing more foreign money into China could help stabilize its stock market and real estate markets when the country's political environment is unsettled over the dismissal last week of Bo Xilai as the Communist Party secretary of Chongqing and over the approach next autumn of a once-in-a-decade change in the country's top leadership.
The Shanghai stock market dropped 1.4 percent on Tuesday and is down 22.2 percent from its high in mid-April last year, although up slightly from its lows in early January.
The government has deliberately engineered a fall in real estate prices to address widespread concerns about housing affordability, and has used mostly administrative tools to do so, like banning most purchases of second or third homes. But real estate developers and investors say the plunge in prices has taken on its own momentum.
China's securities regulators and a separate government agency, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, had long been leery of the inflationary effects of being swamped with foreign cash. But that view has reversed in the last several weeks, as the renminbi's value has slipped in currency markets on very heavy selling in Asian financial centers like Hong Kong.
The renminbi was down 0.5 percent against the dollar from the start of January through the middle of last week. The weakness was initially attributed to weakening performance of the Chinese economy, but investors increasingly see it as a sign of capital flight as well.
The renminbi has recovered in the last few days of trading and is now virtually unchanged against the dollar this year -- evidently as word has circulated among top fund managers that more foreign money could soon begin washing ashore in China.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission and State Administration of Foreign Exchange were closed on Tuesday evening and its officials could not be reached for comment.
A raising of the foreign investment cap may not necessarily produce an immediate flow of cash into the Chinese market, bankers cautioned; each fund's increase in investment rights will require separate paperwork from the foreign exchange agency.
But until now, investment opportunities for foreign capital in China have been so scarce that some investment companies have paid to rent other companies' rights to invest in China.
The going rate on these investment rents until recently was about 0.6 percent of the value of the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor rights. So an international company or mutual fund that wanted to hold $100 million worth of stocks on the Shanghai stock exchange would have to pay about $600,000 a year to rent the necessary investor rights.
But the value of those rents has begun to decline as international worries about the Chinese economy have increased in recent weeks. The new doubling of financial investment rights is likely to depress the rents further.
The doubling of rights could help offset a slowdown in foreign investment into factories and other fixed assets in China, as well as a deterioration in China's trade balance. Slowing foreign direct investment and weaker exports, together with some capital flight from China, has upset the balance of foreign exchange inflows and outflows in China, weakening the Chinese currency.
With more than $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, China has more than enough financial firepower to defend its currency against serious attacks on its value by speculators in financial markets. China also controls the spot market for renminbi within China through heavy regulations.
But so many renminbi are now circulating offshore that spot and forward trading have expanded rapidly in Hong Kong and Singapore, posing a challenge for Chinese regulators.
The financial company chairman said that as recently as early last year, it could take him a couple of days to move $500 million into forward renminbi contracts without causing the price to change.
Now this can be done in just 15 minutes, he said, indicating it was a sign of how liquid the market has become and hard it now is for the Chinese government to control it.

REVIVING TALKS Just one month after deal talks between Yahoo and its Asian partners collapsed, the sides are coming together once again.
Alibaba's chief financial officer and lead deal negotiator, Joe Tsai, flew to Silicon Valley last week to meet with Yahoo's chief executive, Scott Thompson, left, according to two people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ronald Fisher, a managing partner of SoftBank Capital, the largest owner of Yahoo Japan, also attended the meetings. EVELYN M. RUSLI 
DERIVATIVES RULES Regulators approved new rules for the $600 trillion derivatives market on Tuesday, aiming to raise competition and impose more rigorous risk management on an industry that played a central role in the financial crisis.
While the rules are among the most arcane provisions to come from the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, officials say the changes will impose crucial new oversight on the derivatives industry. BEN PROTESS
PAY CUT Anshu Jain, below, the incoming co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank, took a 23 percent cut in his compensation last year after the European sovereign debt crisis and turmoil in financial markets prompted a loss in the investment banking division.

HEADLINE: 2 Federal Reserve Nominees Make It to a Confirmation Hearing

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Two of the White House's nominees to fill vacancies on the Federal Reserve board moved closer to confirmation on Tuesday after a routine Senate hearing.
The Senate banking committee held a hearing to test the two candidates, the Harvard economist Jeremy C. Stein and Jerome H. Powell, a former private equity executive and Treasury official. If the committee approves the two candidates as expected, perhaps as early as next week, and they pass a Senate vote, the Fed would have a full roster of seven confirmed governors for the first time in six years.
The confirmation process for the two capital markets experts comes amid a tense political climate. For months, the White House has lashed out at Congress for failing to vote on confirming important economic policy makers, including nominees to the Fed board. Lawmakers, in turn, have criticized the White House for starting to vault over the traditional confirmation process. 
But Professor Stein and Mr. Powell seem to be candidates chosen to avoid a fight. The nomination of Mr. Powell, a Republican, is the first time in nearly 25 years that a president has nominated a member of the opposing party to the Fed's powerful board, not counting the position of chairman. Mr. Powell is currently a visiting scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based research group.
Professor Stein is an acclaimed academic economist. He served on President George H. W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, and advised the Obama administration for six months in 2009.
The two nominees made few waves during the short and generally amiable hearing on Tuesday, in which they discussed how to start shrinking the Federal Reserve's bloated balance sheet, the appropriate course of monetary policy and transparency at the institution.
Both nominees underscored their specialized knowledge of financial and capital markets -- expertise in relatively short supply on the Fed's board at the moment. The board currently consists of Ben S. Bernanke and Janet L. Yellen, both academic economists; Elizabeth A. Duke, a former banker; Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former regulator; and Daniel Tarullo, a law professor.
Professor Stein said his research tried ''to understand the real-world details of how monetary policy filters through the banking system to ultimately impact borrowers and lenders,'' according to his prepared testimony.
Mr. Powell said his ''practical experience of the private sector and the financial markets would provide a valuable perspective'' to the Fed's internal deliberations, according to his prepared testimony.
Only four senators quizzed the nominees during the question-and-answer period: Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota and the committee's chairman; Kay Hagan, Democrat of North Carolina; Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey; and Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the committee's ranking member.
Both of the nominees said the Fed should consider tightening interest rates to fight off inflation before the end of 2014 if economic conditions merit it. The Fed has said it plans to keep short-term rates close to zero until late 2014.
If ''the economy were to strengthen materially faster than expected, it would be absolutely warranted to revisit the path of the easing,'' Professor Stein said. Mr. Powell agreed, saying he would carefully weigh the Fed's dual mandate to maintain price stability and promote full employment.
In 2010, Senator Shelby put a hold on the nomination of Peter A. Diamond, a Nobel laureate in economics and professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to join the board. Still awaiting confirmation, Professor Diamond withdrew his nomination last year. Thus far, no senators have voiced significant opposition to the two current nominees.
But nominations remain a contentious issue between the White House and Congress. This winter, President Obama bypassed the Senate and installed two nominees using recess appointments.

HEADLINE: Glencore Buys Viterra of Canada for $6.2 Billion

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
OTTAWA - Glencore International, the Swiss commodities trader, entered the North American agriculture market on Tuesday with a widely anticipated deal to acquire Viterra, the largest Canadian grain company, for $6.2 billion.
The all-cash transaction comes months before the end to the Canadian Wheat Board's monopoly on export sales of a variety of grains. Canada is the world's third-largest wheat exporter and the leading exporter of durum wheat, the variety most prized by pasta makers.
Glencore is best known as a mineral trading company and is currently trying to get regulatory and antitrust approval to buy the remainder of the mining firm Xstrata it does not own for $41 billion. 
But it has been gradually expanding its agricultural business beyond Europe and Russia into other grain markets including Australia, where it started operations nine years ago and where Viterra also has substantial assets. With Canada's strong position as a wheat exporter, the deal gives the company much more global influence than it had previously in grain trading.
Glencore was founded by Marc Rich, a financier who fled the United States rather than face federal tax evasion charges and was granted a pardon by PresidentBill Clinton on his last day in office in 2001.
The Viterra purchase gives Glencore its first major agricultural holding in North America. During a news conference, Chris Mahoney, Glencore's director of agricultural products, suggested that the company would look for another major deal as part of its planned expansion into the United States.
''It would always have been difficult for us to grow silo by silo in North America,'' he said.
The transaction, which was unanimously approved by Viterra's board, values the company's shares at 16.25 Canadian dollars apiece, 48 percent above the price where Viterra was trading before it announced it was being pursued.
Now that the wheat board monopoly is ending, Viterra may be the sole buyer for many farmers in areas where it is the only the grain elevator operator in the region. But in an effort to prevent the deal from being blocked by Canada's foreign investment review agency or the country's competition regulator, Glencore has already struck two deals to sell some of Viterra's assets to Canadian companies.
Agrium, a Canadian fertilizer producer, will pay 1.8 billion Canadian dollars for Viterra's farm supply stores and its investments in the fertilizer industry. Richardson International, a 155-year-old Canadian grain handler, will get 19 of Viterra's grain elevators and some other asset for 800 million Canadian dollars.
Derek G. Brewin, an agriculture economist at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, said that the sale of the grain elevators may alleviate any competition concerns posed by the deal. He said that most of the assets being transferred are in areas which are currently dominated by Viterra.
''That's good in competition terms for farmers,'' Professor Brewin said.
Viterra controls about 45 percent of grain handling in Canada. Curt Vossen, the president of Richardson, said that after the elevator sale, his company and Glencore would each have about 34 percent of the market.
''This puts us into markets where we've long wanted to be involved,'' Mr. Vossen said.
Less clear immediately is the deal's fate before under Canada's foreign investment review laws. Unlike competition cases which are made by handled by independent investigators and a tribunal, decisions under foreign investment laws are political.
The province of Saskatchewan, which Viterra is based, could wield influence over the federal government's review of foreign ownership rules. Previously, the province pushed Canada's federal government to scuttle a $38.6 billion purchase of the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, a major fertilizer producer, by BHP Billiton, the large Australian mining company in 2010.
Mr. Mahoney said the Viterra deal did not face the same challenges as the Potash case. He said that Regina, Saskatchewan, where Viterra is based, would become the headquarters for Glencore's Canadian agricultural businesses as well as any operations it acquires in the United States.
Viterra has a strong emotional attachment to some Canadian farmers and communities. The company was founded in 2007 after the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, a former farmers' cooperative, acquired Agricore United, a grain handler that itself was formed from cooperatives in Alberta and Manitoba.
Professor Brewin said that many farmers still remember that their grandparents signing the charters that created those cooperatives - an attempt by farmers to reduce the influence of private traders. The cooperatives' elevators were symbols of rural Western Canada. During the contentious debate over the future of the wheat board in the past year, some people expressed concern that an end to its monopoly would force Viterra into foreign hands.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Home of Chicago Rail Cars Set to Undergo Renovation

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHAROFF

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- At its peak, the town of Pullman housed upward of 12,000 people in a parklike setting 12 miles south of downtown Chicago. They worked at the Pullman Palace Car Company, and spent their time and money in housing, schools, churches and stores built just for them by George Pullman, the company's founder and one of the world's wealthiest men.
Pullman, which was built over a four-year period starting in 1880, was one of the first built-from-scratch industrial cities in America. But the town's fate was sealed just a few years later by the recession of 1894. Pullman simultaneously slashed wages but declined to lower workers' rents. The result was a bloody two-month strike led by Eugene V. Debs of the American Railway Union that led to the deaths of several workers. In the aftermath, the state ordered the company to sell off its residential holdings. Pullman himself died in 1897.
In the decades that followed, Pullman became just another South Side neighborhood, albeit one with a distinctive look and feel. (The area is both a National Historic Landmark as well as a Chicago Landmark District.) The Pullman company remained the area's largest employer before finally closing its neighborhood factory in the 1950s. 
By the early 2000s the area was struggling. ''A lot of the industrial companies that used to be here left, and the area started to go down,'' said Anthony Beale, the alderman for the Ninth Ward, which includes Pullman.
Now, a series of projects and initiatives by various state agencies and nonprofit groups is raising hopes that the neighborhood may be on the brink of a revival.
The largest project is Pullman Park, a $350 million mixed-use development on the site of an old steel plant. The project, which will consist of about 670,000 square feet of new retail space, a 125,000-square-foot neighborhood recreation center carved out of a factory building and 1,100 housing units, will be completed in phases in the next decade.
The first phase, which includes a Walmart, is set to open late this year or early next year. The first phase of the project is costing $37 million, just over half of which is coming from U.S. Bank in the form of new markets tax credits and a $10 million loan. The rest, about $17 million, is coming from Walmart.
The developers of the project are the nonprofit Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives, or C.N.I., and U.S. Bank's community development subsidiary.
''We spent a year going to all the community groups and block clubs and churches asking for input on how to improve the neighborhood,'' said David Doig, the president of C.N.I. ''The recurring themes were people wanted a decent place to shop; second, the residents wanted a safe, affordable place for their kids to play; and the third concern was the lack of affordable housing, particularly for seniors and young families.''
Community development projects in Chicago often include some form of city financing, like tax increment financing grants. The first phase of Pullman Park, however, does not do this. The reason is Walmart, which has a long, antagonistic history with the city's unions and their allies in the City Council.
''We were basically advised that getting the plan approved at all was going to be as much Walmart as the City Council could absorb,'' Mr. Doig said.
Steven Restivo, Walmart's director of community affairs, said the new store would satisfy several goals. ''It's an opportunity to serve customers without a lot of options. It's also an opportunity to show that Walmart stores can be a magnet for growth and development.''
Mr. Doig's group and another large nonprofit entity, Mercy Housing Lakefront, are also moving ahead with affordable housing initiatives.
The original housing in Pullman dates from 1881 and is a mix of single and multifamily dwellings, with row houses predominating. Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives' plan involves renovating and reselling foreclosed and abandoned houses on Pullman's long-ignored north side. (The north side is separated from the more intact south side by the long-vacant Pullman company factory and administrative offices complex.)
So far, C.N.I. has spent about $4 million to acquire and renovate about 15 houses, and is currently working on 11 others.
''We sell them for $100,000, and it costs us probably double that to buy and redo them,'' Mr. Doig said. ''We have to renovate them to historic standards, which means custom windows and doors and architectural details like mansard roofs that have to be specially built.'' Mr. Doig said the cost difference was made up with funds from the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, a federal initiative that helps state and local governments buy distressed properties.
Mercy Housing Lakefront recently spent $30 million to buy and renovate the Pullman Wheelworks, a former industrial building that was converted into 210 units of Section 8 housing in the 1980s but has suffered from years of deferred maintenance.
Cindy Holler, the president of Mercy Housing Lakefront, said her group was spending $45,000 a unit in renovations, using a mix of historic and low-income tax credits, as well as money from the state and from the MacArthur Foundation. Residents will pay 30 percent of their income for the refurbished units.
''We think it's a great place for work force housing,'' Ms. Holler said, ''which is why Pullman built it in the first place. We want to build on and support the other things that are happening in the neighborhood.'' he final piece of the Pullman puzzle is the long-vacant Hotel Florence -- named for George Pullman's daughter and where he kept an elaborate suite -- and the factory and administrative offices complex. The two properties face each other across 111th Street and have been owned by the state since 1991.
Late last year, the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency began a $3.5 million partial renovation of the 50-plus-room hotel that involves updating the mechanical functions and repairing the roof and the facade.
Catherine Shannon, the acting director of the agency, said the renovation was the first step to finding an eventual use for the hotel. ''It's a wonderful building with a rich history,'' she said, ''and if we don't invest the money now, it will be more costly in the future.''
Across the street at the factory and administrative offices complex, the picture is less clear. Shortly after the state acquired the properties, a fire devastated both buildings. Over the last 20 years, the state has spent about $16 million to rebuild the administration building and stabilize the factory building.
Last fall, the state engaged the Chicago office of the Urban Land Institute, a research group based in Washington, to suggest ideas for redeveloping the site. The final report was issued last week.
Possible uses include everything from a brewery to a museum for organized labor or African-American history. The project manager for the study, Christine Kolb, said the site had a lot of positive qualities. ''The amount of space there and the uses it could accommodate are pretty high,'' she said. ''It's really a question of finding someone who's charged to redevelop it.''
Meanwhile, another idea -- no one is quite sure where it originated -- draws on President Obama's history as a community organizer in the Ninth Ward. Proponents say the complex would make a great site for Mr. Obama's eventual presidential library.
''We're not sure how realistic that is,'' Ms. Shannon said. ''But certainly there are community members here who would like to see that happen.''

HEADLINE: Shares Fall on Concerns Of a Slowdown in China

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks declined on Tuesday, ending a three-day advance for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, as commodities fell on concern about a Chinese economic slowdown.
Industrial and commodity shares slumped as China raised fuel prices by the most in two years and BHP Billiton said the nation's steel production was slowing. Caterpillar and Alcoa dropped more than 1.5 percent. Adobe Systems sank 3.9 percent as its profit forecast missed some estimates. Bank of America jumped 2.9 percent. Tiffany surged 6.7 percent after forecasting profit that beat projections.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index retreated 4.23 points, 0.30 percent, to 1,405.52, after advancing on Monday to the highest level since May 2008. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 68.94 points, or 0.52 percent, to 13,170.19. The Nasdaq composite index fell 4.17 points, or 0.14 percent, to 3,074.15. 
''A Chinese slowdown is inevitable,'' Peter Jankovskis, an investment manager at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Ill., said. ''It's possible that will take some of the heat out of commodities. Yet China is not the only growth story out there. China will continue to be an important player, but the U.S. economy seems to have found its legs.''
Gold declined for the second time in three sessions on concern that demand will drop in India and China, the world's biggest buyers. Silver also retreated.
China may reduce purchases as the economy slows and fuel costs rise, according to Frank Lesh, a trader at FuturePath Trading in Chicago.
Equities fell as China raised fuel prices for the second time in less than six weeks. The nation's vehicle sales may miss industry forecasts this year as economic growth slows, an official from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said. BHP Billiton, the mining company, said China's steel production was slowing. In the United States housing starts hovered in February near a three-year high.
Companies most dependent on economic growth had the biggest declines in the S.& P. 500. The Dow Jones transportation average retreated 1.3 percent. A gauge of home builders in S.& P. indexes dropped 1 percent as 10 of its 11 stocks fell.
Measures of industrial and commodity shares in the S.& P. 500 dropped more than 0.5 percent. Caterpillar slumped 2.61 percent, to $110.76. Alcoa slid 1.51 percent, to $10.44. Peabody Energy, the biggest coal producer in the United States, declined 5.38 percent, to $31.64.
Adobe sank 3.91 percent, to $33.16. Excluding some costs, profit will be 57 to 61 cents a share in the second quarter, Adobe said. The midpoint of that range, 59 cents, missed the 60 cents predicted by analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Walt Disney dropped 0.46 percent, to $43.24. The company said the box-office disappointment ''John Carter'' will post a loss of about $200 million.
A rally in financial companies helped the S.& P. 500 trim a decline of as much as 0.9 percent. The KBW Bank Index added 0.4 percent. Bank of America rallied 2.94 percent, the most in the Dow, to $9.81. Morgan Stanley gained 1.74 percent, to $20.41.
The Jefferies Group climbed 2.26 percent, to $19.49. The company reported a profit decline that was smaller than analysts estimated as net revenue climbed to a record.
Tiffany surged 6.68 percent, to $73.27. The company is benefiting from stock-market gains that have prompted luxury consumers to resume jewelry purchases, a turnabout from January, when the retailer said weak spending by customers in the United States had slowed holiday sales.
Apple added 0.81 percent, to a record $605.96. The company disclosed plans on Monday to pay a dividend and buy back stock.
Interest rates declined Tuesday following the longest rise since 2006. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 3/32, to 96 26/32, and the yield slipped to 2.36 percent from 2.38 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: Home Building Permits Rise to the Highest Level Since October 2008

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Permits for home building neared a three-and-a-half-year high in February, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, suggesting a budding recovery in the housing market was still on track although groundbreaking activity slipped. 
New building permits surged 5.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 717,000 units last month, the highest since October 2008, the agency said.
The increase, which exceeded economists' expectations of a rate of 690,000 units, reinforced views that the housing market was improving and that home building would add to economic growth this year for the first time since 2005.
''The data provides further evidence of a rebound in housing activity,'' said Eric Green, chief economist at TD Securities in New York. ''Housing is being nursed back to health, but getting out of rehab takes time.''
While signs of progress are emerging in the housing market, an oversupply of unsold homes is depressing prices, and starts are still less than a third of the 2.27 million rate peak reached in January 2006.
In February, housing starts slipped 1.1 percent to a rate of 698,000 units, but there was more new construction activity in January than previously reported. Moreover, starts last month rose 34.7 percent from February last year, the biggest year-to-year increase since April 2010.
Construction of single-family dwellings, the largest share of the market, dropped 9.9 percent last month, but groundbreaking for multifamily housing projects soared 21.1 percent.
Over the last year, starts on single-family homes have risen 17.8 percent, while multifamily starts have nearly doubled as demand for rental properties has increased, with many Americans moving away from homeownership.
Permits last month were helped by a 4.9 percent rise in approvals for single-family dwelling projects to their highest level since April 2010. It was the fifth consecutive month that building permits in the category increased.

HEADLINE: Off the Menu

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
Opening
ATERA For a mere 17 diners -- 12 at a counter and 5 at a table -- Matthew Lightner, formerly the chef of Castagna in Portland, Ore., will prepare a 10-course, $150 tasting menu, a different one each evening. Though Portland is even farther from Scandinavia than New York is, some of the creations will echo the Nordic approach, especially in foraged ingredients like greens, wild mushrooms, lichens and wild onions. The chef has enlisted the services of Evan Strusinski, a wild-food specialist from Camden, Me. ''It will be interesting to see what we get as the weather warms,'' Mr. Lightner said. ''This is an almost herbal-based cuisine.'' But the herbs on the plate will not have been plucked from the restaurant's wall of greenery, which he said was meant mainly to set the stage. Expect dishes like sweetbreads with savory toffee and wild onions; cured scallops with meringues, gin mash and frozen juice; and sheep's milk yogurt with frozen beet juice, jasmine and nuts. Reservations are accepted up to two months in advance for seats available from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. (Opens Wednesday): 77 Worth Street (Broadway); (212) 226-1444. 
FRANCESCA Frank Castronovo summed up what goes into a new restaurant in New York these days: ''It's the best fun ever, opening a restaurant with no D.O.B., no S.L.A., no D.O.H. no C.B. 3,'' he said in an e-mail. For those who have never had to pay the rent while their dream dining room is delayed for months, he was referring to the various agencies that have to sign off on the project before customers can come in. And he didn't even mention Con Edison turning on the gas. With his partner, Frank Falcinelli, Mr. Castronovo is changing their Spuntino restaurant on the Lower East Side from an Italian to a Spanish place, serving Basque-style tapas fashioned by Ryan Bartlow, who toiled in San Sebastian, Spain, for two years. (Friday): 17 Clinton Street (Houston Street); (212) 253-2303.
GINNY'S SUPPER CLUB When Marcus Samuelsson and Andrew Chapman opened Red Rooster in Harlem a little over a year ago, they had a rather featureless downstairs space that was occasionally used for community activities, and increasingly for music. But plans were percolating. ''I wanted to make sure we had a success upstairs before I tackled this,'' said Mr. Samuelsson, who has now turned the space into a retro supper club rich with mellow evening atmosphere, to evoke the Cotton Club and other uptown hot spots of yore. The 120-seat space features mainly live music like R&B, jazz, soul and swing, every night. A menu unlike Red Rooster's, mostly small to midsize plates, includes seared shrimp with endive, boneless chicken confit fried and served with waffles, and sliced steak with potato cake. Cocktails are the responsibility of the consulting mixologist, Eben Klemm, who tweaks classics like the Sazerac with homemade caraway rye: 310 Lenox Avenue (125th Street); (212) 792-9001.
STICKY'S FINGER JOINT An upstate farm provides the chicken for boneless baked, fried or plain ''fingers,'' along with a tofu option, at this spot, which is part of Eighth Street's makeover from a strip of discount shoe stores to a showcase of food, coffee and dessert shops. Quite a collection of sauces and sides are available in this storefront, with just 12 seats and a takeout counter: 31 West Eighth Street; (212) 777-7131.
Looking Ahead
THE BUTTERFLY In the Altamarea Group of restaurants (Marea, Ai Fiori and others), Eben Freeman is to cocktails and drinks what Michael White is to food. As ''head of bar operations and innovation,'' he has taken the lead in this small restaurant and bar, to open this summer. Originally, the group was looking to open a bar, perhaps serving cured meats and cheeses, Mr. Freeman said, but when it leased this space in TriBeCa, it realized it had to sell food, too. ''It just wouldn't work economically without it,'' he said. Though the restaurant will open at 11:30 a.m., the atmosphere is meant to suggest a supper club. And Mr. White's menu, still being developed, will be basic: steak, burgers, fried chicken and some special features, like a prime-rib night on Wednesdays and a fish fry on Fridays: 225 West Broadway (Franklin Street).

HEADLINE: Inequality Undermines Democracy

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
Americans have never been too worried about the income gap. The gap between the rich and the rest has been much wider in the United States than in other developed nations for decades. Still, polls show we are much less concerned about it than people in those other nations are.
Policy makers haven't cared much either. The United States does less than other rich countries to transfer income from the affluent to the less fortunate. Even as the income gap has grown enormously over the last 30 years, government has done little to curb the trend.
Our tolerance for a widening income gap may be ebbing, however. Since Occupy Wall Street and kindred movements highlighted the issue, the chasm between the rich and ordinary workers has become a crucial talking point in the Democratic Party's arsenal. In a speech in Osawatomie, Kan., last December, President Obama underscored how ''the rungs of the ladder of opportunity had grown farther and farther apart, and the middle class has shrunk.'' 
There are signs that the political strategy has traction. Inequality isn't quite the top priority of voters: only 17 percent of Americans think it is extremely important for the government to try to reduce income and wealth inequality, according to a Gallup survey last November. That is about half the share that said reigniting economic growth was crucial.
But a slightly different question indicates views have changed: 29 percent said it was extremely important for the government to increase equality of opportunity. More significant, 41 percent said that there was not much opportunity in America, up from 17 percent in 1998.
Americans have been less willing to take from the rich and give to the poor in part because of a belief that each of us has a decent shot at prosperity. In 1952, 87 percent of Americans thought there was plenty of opportunity for progress; only 8 percent disagreed. As income inequality has grown, though, many have changed their minds.
From 1993 to 2010, the incomes of the richest 1 percent of Americans grew 58 percent while the rest had a 6.4 percent bump. There is little reason to think the trend will go into reverse any time soon, given globalization and technological change, which have weighed heavily on the wages of less educated workers who compete against machines and cheap foreign labor while increasing the returns of top executives and financiers.
The income gap narrowed briefly during the Great Recession, as plummeting stock prices shrunk the portfolios of the rich. But in 2010, the first year of recovery, the top 1 percent of Americans captured 93 percent of the income gains.
Under these conditions, perhaps it is unsurprising that a growing share of Americans have lost faith in their ability to get ahead.
We have accepted income inequality in the past partly because of the belief that capitalism can't work without it. If entrepreneurs invest and workers improve their skills to improve their lot in life, a government that heavily taxed the rich to give to the poor could destroy that incentive and stymie economic growth that benefits everybody.
The nation's relatively fast growth over the last three decades appeared to support this view. The United States grew faster than advanced economies with a more egalitarian distribution of income, like the European Union and Japan, so keeping redistribution to a minimum while allowing markets to function unimpeded was considered the best fuel.
Meanwhile, skeptics of income redistribution pointed out that inequality doesn't look so dire when it is viewed over a lifetime rather than at a single point in time. One study found that about half the households in the poorest fifth of the population moved to a higher quintile within a decade.
Even though the wealthy reaped most of growth's rewards, critics of redistribution noted that incomes grew over the last 30 years for all but the poorest American families. And in the 1990s, a decade of soaring inequality, even families in the bottom fifth saw their incomes rise.
Some economists have argued that inequality is not the right social ill to focus on. ''What matters is how the poor and middle class are doing and how much opportunity they have,'' said Scott Winship, an economist at the Brookings Institution. ''Until there is stronger evidence that inequality has a negative effect on the life of the average person, I'm inclined to accept it.''
Perhaps Americans' newfound concerns about their lack of opportunity are a reaction to our economic doldrums, with high unemployment and stagnant incomes, and have little to do with inequality. Perhaps these concerns will dissipate when jobs become more plentiful.
Perhaps. Evidence is mounting, however, that inequality itself is obstructing Americans' shot at a better life.
Alan Krueger, Mr. Obama's top economic adviser, offers a telling illustration of the changing views on income inequality. In the 1990s he preferred to call it ''dispersion,'' which stripped it of a negative connotation.
In 2003, in an essay called ''Inequality, Too Much of a Good Thing'' Mr. Krueger proposed that ''societies must strike a balance between the beneficial incentive effects of inequality and the harmful welfare-decreasing effects of inequality.'' Last January he took another step: ''the rise in income dispersion -- along so many dimensions -- has gotten to be so high, that I now think that inequality is a more appropriate term.''
Progress still happens, but there is less of it. Two-thirds of American families -- including four of five in the poorest fifth of the population -- earn more than their parents did 30 years earlier. But they don't advance much. Four out of 10 children whose family is in the bottom fifth will end up there as adults. Only 6 percent of them will rise to the top fifth.
It is difficult to measure changes in income mobility over time. But some studies suggest it is declining: the share of families that manage to rise out of the bottom fifth of earnings has fallen since the early 1980s. So has the share of people that fall from the top.
And on this count too, the United States seems to be trailing other developed nations. Comparisons across countries suggest a fairly strong, negative link between the level of inequality and the odds of advancement across the generations. And the United States appears at extreme ends along both of these dimensions -- with some of the highest inequality and lowest mobility in the industrial world.
The link makes sense: a big income gap is likely to open up other social breaches that make it tougher for those lower down the rungs to get ahead. And that is exactly what appears to be happening in the United States, where a narrow elite is peeling off from the rest of society by a chasm of wealth, power and experience.
The sharp rise in the cost of college is making it harder for lower-income and middle-class families to progress, feeding education inequality.
Inequality is also fueling geographical segregation -- pushing the homes of the rich and poor further apart. Brides and grooms increasingly seek out mates with similar levels of income and education. Marriages among less-educated people have become much more likely to fail.
And a growing income gap has bred a gap in political clout that could entrench inequality for a very long time. One study found that public spending on education was lower in countries like Britain and the United States where the rich participate more in the political process than the poor, and higher in countries like Sweden and Denmark, where levels of political participation are approximately similar across the income scale. If the very rich can use the political system to slow or stop the ascent of the rest, the United States could become a hereditary plutocracy under the trappings of liberal democracy.
One doesn't have to believe in equality to be concerned about these trends. Once inequality becomes very acute, it breeds resentment and political instability, eroding the legitimacy of democratic institutions. It can produce political polarization and gridlock, splitting the political system between haves and have-nots, making it more difficult for governments to address imbalances and respond to brewing crises. That too can undermine economic growth, let alone democracy.

HEADLINE: Republicans Introduce Their Plan For Budget

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House Republicans thrust their vision of a smaller government, a flatter tax code and a free-market Medicare system into the 2012 election season on Tuesday, banking that fears over surging federal deficits will trump longstanding voter allegiances to popular government programs.
The House Budget Committee blueprint for spending and taxation over the next decade would reshape Medicare into a system of private insurance plans, shrink programs for the poor and turn them over to state governments, and try to simplify the tax code for individuals and businesses. The six existing tax rates, topping off at 35 percent, would be reduced to two, 10 percent and 25 percent, while states would be allowed to place time limits, work requirements and other restrictions on programs from food stamps to welfare. 
At the same time, the proposal calls for reducing spending below the cap agreed to in last year's debt limit deal, raising the prospect of a tense fiscal clash just a month before the election.
''This is about putting an end to empty promises from a bankrupt government,'' said Representative Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee and the chief architect of the plan. Mr. Ryan said he had spoken to each of the remaining Republican presidential contenders and expressed confidence that they would back his proposal.
The plan amounts to the most detailed vision yet for Republican governance should the party hold the House and win back the Senate and White House in November. Although the budget plan has no chance of being enacted this year, it could become a touchstone for future general election campaigns. The Republican front-runner, Mitt Romney, hailed it as ''a bold step toward putting our nation back on the track of fiscal sanity'' and called the Medicare changes ''prescriptions that will strengthen Medicare for generations to come.''
The White House communications director, Dan Pfeiffer, countered that the budget plan ''fails the test of balance, fairness and shared responsibility'' and would ''end Medicare as we know it.''
House Republicans understand they are placing a bet that three years of trillion-dollar deficits have prepared the electorate for monumental changes. Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma and a former National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, conceded the move is ''high risk politically.'' The budget will be formally drafted on Wednesday with a final House vote next week.
''It's going to be a big deal,'' said Mr. Cole, a member of the Budget and Appropriations Committees. ''This budget was rolled out in the context of a presidential election. The House is shaping the national debate.''
Under the Ryan plan, spending would be cut $5.3 trillion below President Obama's budget through 2022. Medicare would be shaved by $205 billion. Medicaid and other health programs would be cut $770 billion. Other entitlement programs, including welfare, food stamps, agriculture subsidies and transportation, would be cut by nearly $2 trillion. Budget experts said that last figure was so high it could only be reached by scaling back or eliminating payments to the working poor through the earned income credit.
Programs at the discretion of Congress would be cut $352 billion below the levels requested by the president over 10 years. To do that, House spending bills will have to come in well below the caps set last July after hard-fought negotiations over raising the statutory debt limit. In the fiscal year that begins this October, the House plan sets spending on domestic programs $19 billion below the limit in last summer's Budget Control Act. But because of increases to military spending, White House officials said Congress would have to impose an immediate, $27 billion cut below the cap, or about 5 percent.
''By desperately attempting to appease their extreme conservative base, House Republicans are reneging on a deal their own speaker shook on less than eight months ago,'' said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, who suggested the divergent roads the House and Senate will take on spending bills could lead to another spending showdown this fall.
House Republicans argue that additional cuts to both discretionary and entitlement spending are needed now to head off automatic, $110 billion in across-the-board cuts to military and domestic programs in 2013. Under the House plan, the current $1.18 trillion deficit would fall to $797 billion in the coming fiscal year, compared with $977 billion under Mr. Obama's plan. But by 2016, the deficit would fall to $241 billion by Republican estimates. The Congressional Budget Office estimated last week that Mr. Obama's budget would still have a $529 billion deficit.
To get the budget balanced, Mr. Ryan is counting on the government shrinking to levels not seen since the beginning of World War II. Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program would shrink from its current 2 percent of the gross domestic product to 1 percent in 2030. Entitlement and domestic programs outside Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security would shrivel from the 12.5 percent of G.D.P. it reached in 2011 to 5.75 percent in 2030 to 3.75 percent in 2050, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The Ryan plan would accumulate $3.1 trillion in additional debt through 2022. The president's would pile on $6.4 trillion, more than twice that total. The Republican budget mandates the repeal of Mr. Obama's health care law and assumes the elimination of the government-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The tax code would be simplified to just two tax rates, 10 percent and 25 percent, with the closure of tax credits and deductions. The 35 percent corporate income tax would be lowered to 25 percent and the existing worldwide system of taxing corporate profits would be changed to a territorial system where only domestic profits are subject to United States corporate taxation. The budget assumes revenues would stay consistent with revenues under the current individual and corporate tax codes.
Medicare would be turned into a subsidized set of private insurance plans, but with the option of buying into the existing fee-for-service program.

HEADLINE: Oil Under Our Noses

BYLINE: By STEPHEN R. KELLY. 
Stephen R. Kelly, a former American diplomat, teaches courses on energy security at Duke.

 BODY:
Durham, N.C.
ACCORDING to the current storyline regarding this fall's presidential election, Barack Obama has jumped out of the frying pan of a weak economy into the fire of skyrocketing gas prices, a spike driven largely by tensions in the Persian Gulf. Like President Carter before him, Mr. Obama supposedly risks losing an election over something he can't control.
Fortunately for the president -- and millions of American drivers -- he may have more energy options than most of his recent predecessors. 
Thanks in part to surging oil imports from our continental neighbors, Persian Gulf oil now constitutes a significantly smaller share of American oil imports than it did just 20 years ago. At the same time, domestic oil production is actually increasing after decades of decline, meaning we have to import less than before.
Taken together, these trends suggest that the oil weapon, at least in the hands of Persian Gulf producers, may no longer have the same edge for the United States.
According to the Energy Information Administration, in 2010 some 49 percent of American crude oil and petroleum product imports came from the Western Hemisphere -- about 25 percent of that from Canada alone, making it our single largest supplier. (Other substantial hemispheric oil suppliers include Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil.) In contrast, the Persian Gulf states provided only 18 percent of our oil imports in 2010, down from 27 percent as recently as 1993.
More surprising, though, is that we're importing a smaller share of our oil needs. In 2005, America imported 60 percent of the oil we consumed. By 2011, that number had shrunk to less than half of our total oil consumption, due mainly to new domestic production from unconventional sources in North Dakota and enhanced recovery from older wells in Texas.
Of course, this doesn't mean we are completely free of the Persian Gulf oil yoke. Should Iran halt its oil exports in reaction to Western moves against its nuclear program, or even close the critical Strait of Hormuz, oil prices would certainly soar, in the United States as well as abroad.
But the new oil paradigm suggests that the pain will be distributed in unexpected ways.
Take gasoline prices. They have risen sharply at home in recent months, but not uniformly. The Energy Information Administration reported that as of Feb. 27, gasoline in the Rocky Mountain states was selling for 53 cents a gallon less than the national average. This was a record spread, and largely a result of a glut of landlocked Canadian and domestic crude.
Or take the physical security of oil supplies. The United States may rely less on Persian Gulf crude, but it constitutes 77 percent of Japan's imports, 74 percent of South Korea's and 43 percent of China's imports. For these countries, the physical availability of oil, not just its price, would be a critical issue in a confrontation with Iran. In contrast, we would pay more for oil, but the oil wealth of our neighbors and our growing domestic supply means we'd still be able to get it.
This geopolitical paradigm shift means that America needs to realign its energy policy in several key places. For one thing, we should review the estimated $50 billion a year we now spend to maintain a military presence in the Persian Gulf, not counting the costs of the wars we've been fighting in the region.
True, protecting oil supplies from the Persian Gulf, which holds the world's largest reserves of conventional oil, is going to remain important. But as we reassess what we can afford to do militarily in the world, countries that depend more directly on Persian Gulf oil should pay a larger share of the burden for keeping the region stable.
In our own backyard, the Senate should quickly ratify an agreement with Mexico, which the administration initialed last month, that establishes joint rules for exploring trans-boundary oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Given historical and deep-seated Mexican suspicions about American involvement in its energy sector, this treaty is a surprising step forward for joint production of what are likely to be major oil and gas opportunities.
Moreover, the administration should expedite approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, intended to bring more Canadian oil to the United States. The company behind the pipeline recently announced that it would reapply for a permit following the administration's denial of its first application. While Keystone's merits have been debated at length, from a national security standpoint, the more crude flowing peacefully from our next-door neighbor, the safer we will be during the next international oil crisis.
The oil weapon may not be as sharp as it once was, but it still has an edge. If we want to avoid being held hostage over oil, we should shift our focus away from the Persian Gulf and work with our neighbors to develop even more reliable sources closer to home.

HEADLINE: Jefferies Buoys Wall Street With Bond-Trading Profit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
3:49 p.m. Updated
Profits at the Jefferies Group may have slipped in the first quarter, but the investment bank's results are giving Wall Street a reason to cheer.
Though profit at the firm was down 11 percent from the same time last year, the results of its bond-trading operations have bolstered confidence across Wall Street that the business, the profit engine of many financial firms, is coming back.
The results, reported Tuesday, helped push up the stock price not only of Jefferies, which rose more than 2 percent, but those of its competitors as well. Shares in Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which are set to report earnings next month, rose nearly 2 percent each. 
Banks' fixed-income trading operations were quick to rebound after the financial crisis of 2008, and helped stabilize financial firms' revenue. But the European sovereign debt crisis sent convulsions through the bond markets, slicing banks' earnings last fall.
The recent calm that has settled upon the financial world this year has helped restore confidence and stabilized bond trading somewhat. Jefferies more than doubled its revenue from debt trading to $339.1 million from the previous quarter.
Over all, Jefferies said that it earned $77 million, as debt trading and investment banking showed renewed life after faltering in the second half of last year. Jefferies reported $780 million in net revenue for the quarter, up from the period a year earlier.
''Market prices have improved throughout fixed income for the quarter,'' Richard B. Handler, Jefferies's chairman and chief executive, said in a call with analysts on Tuesday. ''A large percentage of the gains were due to healthy customer flows and reasonable bid-ask spreads.''
Beyond the revival in trading, the firm's profit also shows the continued survival of a firm whose viability was questioned in the wake of MF Global's collapse after a big bet on sovereign debt. Among the principal critics was the credit ratings firm Egan-Jones, which warned that it would downgrade Jefferies's bond rating unless it raised an enormous amount of capital.
Jefferies swiftly and sternly rebutted analyst concerns that it had a similar problem, selling off its holdings of foreign government bonds within days as a show of strength.
Since then, Jefferies has rebounded. Its stock price has climbed nearly 42 percent so far this year, and it has taken both market share and staff members from weaker rivals. Those include foreign banks that initially sought to expand in the United States, but were forced into retreat, Mr. Handler said on the call.
Other parts of Jefferies's businesses showed improvement as well. Fees from advising companies on mergers and from underwriting bond offerings both rose significantly, contributing to a 20 percent gain in investment banking revenue for the quarter, to $285.8 million.
Mr. Handler highlighted the firm's big mandates, including serving as the sole adviser to the Samson Investment Company on its sale to a group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for $7.2 billion, in one of the largest leveraged buyouts of the past four years.
Not all of the Jefferies first-quarter results were rosy, however. Both the trading of stocks and the underwriting of equity offerings remained depressed from the same time last year. The firm's chief financial officer, Peregrine C. Broadbent, said in Tuesday's call that it had laid off some equities employees.
Its asset-management fees plummeted 77 percent, to $5.6 million, from the period a year earlier, though the division accounts for a relatively small portion of the firm's total revenue.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Careless House Budget

 BODY:
As he rolled out his 2013 budget on Tuesday, Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, correctly said that he and his fellow Republicans were offering the country a choice of two very clear futures. The one he outlined in his plan could hardly be more bleak.
It is one where the rich pay less in taxes than the unfairly low rates they pay now, while programs for the poor -- including Medicaid and food stamps -- are slashed and thrown to the whims of individual states. Where older Americans no longer have a guarantee that Medicare will pay for their health needs. Where lack of health insurance is rampant, preschool is unaffordable, and environmental and financial regulation are severely weakened. 
Mr. Ryan became well known last year as the face of the most extreme budget plan passed by a house of Congress in modern times. His new budget is, if anything, worse, full of bigger, emptier promises. It is largely in agreement with the plans of the Republican presidential candidates.
It vows to balance tax cuts for corporations and the rich by closing loopholes, but never lists the loopholes. It is, however, quite specific about cutting Medicaid by about 45 percent, leaving 19 million people without care, and eliminating plans to provide health insurance for 33 million who lack coverage now.
Worst of all, it undermines a hard-fought agreement Democrats and Republicans made last August to set spending targets for 2013. Under pressure from House conservatives, Mr. Ryan cut nearly $20 billion from spending levels set in the debt-ceiling pact, breaking faith with the Senate and potentially leading to a government shutdown this fall. Much of that reduction is likely to come from programs like Head Start, Pell grants for college students and state aid.
It also tries an end run around an agreement Republicans signed last year to reduce the deficit over 10 years with equal $55 billion annual cuts to military and domestic programs after the Congressional supercommittee failed to agree on a plan. Mr. Ryan wants to increase defense spending and shift all the cuts to domestic programs, which will probably include food stamps, the federal payroll and mortgage guarantees. Very little of Mr. Ryan's plan will get through the Senate, but it sets a disturbing precedent for future agreements.
Over all, about half of Mr. Ryan's $5 trillion in cuts over a decade would come from health care. His plan to convert Medicare to a ''premium support'' system, though less damaging than last year's proposal, still weakens a guarantee to the elderly and risks driving up costs for future beneficiaries. He would still offer the elderly a fixed amount of money to shop for their own health insurance, but allow the option of enrolling in traditional Medicare.
Unfortunately, that could lead to higher costs and premiums in traditional Medicare because it would attract older and sicker patients who would be expensive to cover, while healthier, cheaper patients flocked to private plans. In the long run, the premium support plan could shift costs to beneficiaries because it would limit annual per capita spending growth to well below the level required by the health care reform act. The plan would also cap the federal contribution to Medicaid by turning the program into a block grant to states.
These extreme cuts and changes would greatly impede the nation's economic recovery, and hurt those on the middle and lower economic rungs who suffered most from the recession. The contrast with President Obama's budget, which raises taxes on the rich to protect vital programs while reducing the deficit, could not be more clear.

HEADLINE: Romney Is Victor By Wide Margin In Illinois Vote

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY; Marjorie Connelly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Mitt Romney swept to victory in the Illinois Republican primary on Tuesday, using the full force of his campaign and an argument that he has the best chance of defeating President Obama to overcome doubts among the more conservative voters at the heart of his party.
After his narrow margins of victory in battleground states like Michigan and Ohio and losses in Southern states kept alive questions about his ability to rally his party behind him, Mr. Romney recorded a sizable victory over his closest rival, Rick Santorum, in Illinois's popular vote.
He was poised to collect about three times as many delegates as Mr. Santorum, which aides hoped would increase his lead enough to tamp down talk of a contested convention and build an unassailable advantage in the race for the nomination. And his supporters began making the case anew that it was time for the party to come together for the fall campaign against Mr. Obama.
As Mr. Romney addressed supporters in a hotel ballroom in the Chicago suburb of Schaumburg, he congratulated his rivals and immediately turned his focus to the president. He belittled Mr. Obama's experience as a constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago and as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago, saying the president was ill suited to lead the nation to economic prosperity. 
''It's time to say this word: enough. We've had enough,'' he said. ''We know our future's brighter than these troubled times. We still believe in America, and we deserve a president who believes in us, and I believe in the American people.''
Illinois is the third state in the industrial Midwest that Mr. Romney has carried in the last month. The electorate, particularly in the suburbs of Chicago, where he overwhelmed Mr. Santorum, was also reflective of relatively moderate states that will vote across the Northeast in April.
Surveys of Illinois Republicans leaving polling places showed that Mr. Romney not only won among the groups that usually support him -- moderates, college graduates and wealthier voters -- but also was competitive among Mr. Santorum's generally more loyal coalition of Tea Party supporters and married women.
Mr. Santorum, who had been badly outspent by Mr. Romney and his supportive ''super PAC'' on television here, was winning in the rural and western portions of the state, a point he emphasized as he spoke to his supporters Tuesday night in his home state of Pennsylvania, a must-win for him on April 24.
''We won the areas that conservatives and Republicans populate,'' Mr. Santorum told an overflow crowd in Gettysburg. ''We've got five weeks until a big win and a big delegate sweep in Pennsylvania. We must go out and fight this fight.''
Newt Gingrich finished well behind Mr. Santorum and gave no election night speech. But in an interview on Fox News Channel, he questioned Mr. Santorum's ability to mount the strongest challenge to Mr. Romney and called himself the best choice for conservatives. He predicted a possible convention standoff in which ''we'll have a real conversation about who can best beat Barack Obama.'' Representative Ron Paul of Texas, who was also running poorly in the Illinois returns, made no appearance.
If there was one driving force for Mr. Romney, it was the desire of Illinois Republicans to defeat Mr. Obama. Mr. Romney was supported by nearly three-quarters of those who said in exit polls that winning in November was their top priority.
Mr. Romney came here hoping to provide a convincing enough victory to be able to accelerate his move toward directly confronting the president, leaving the intricacies of the delegate fight to his campaign advisers. Yet unless his Republican rivals decide to step aside, Mr. Romney will not be able to move beyond the primary campaign for at least two more months.
More important than the popular vote here was the allocation of delegates, who for the first time this year appeared on ballots along with the presidential candidates they are pledged to support in the general election. Mr. Romney was vying to win most of them, helping his campaign to widen its lead in the competition to reach the 1,144 necessary for the nomination.
He won at least 41 of the 54 delegates at stake Tuesday, according to The Associated Press, with Mr. Santorum winning at least 10. Three delegate races remained too close to determine early Wednesday.
Party leaders expected Mr. Romney's victory to ''take the steam out of Santorum's argument'' for fighting on to the convention, as the Illinois Republican Party chairman, Pat Brady, a Romney supporter, put it Tuesday.
The arcane and often confusing delegate system is forcing the campaigns to navigate a patchwork of state party bylaws that has built up since the era of Abraham Lincoln, who, as it happened, won the Republican nomination in 1860 after swaying delegates to support him in a third round of voting.
No ballot better exemplifies the complexities of the system than that of Illinois.
When Republicans here went to vote, they were first asked to choose a presidential candidate. But more important was their selection of up to six delegates in each Congressional district -- some of them alternates -- who would presumably support the presidential candidate listed next to their names at the convention in Florida in August.
But those candidates are ''pledged,'' not bound, meaning they face no penalty for switching sides at the convention. The Illinois Republican Party convention in June will select 15 additional delegates, who will essentially be free agents.
In all this year, there are about 500 delegates of that unbound nature, as well as a mix of roughly 1,600 delegates who are either pledged or outright bound to a candidate -- or who will be after the formal allocation in a series of county, district and state Republican Party conventions. Those started after March 6 and will continue into July.
Projecting the delegate count based on the results so far, or pledges of support, is an inexact science. That explains the vast differences in the scorecards of the campaigns and the news media and clouds the picture of just how likely Mr. Romney is to avoid an open convention.
Going into the Illinois primary, Mr. Romney had 522 delegates, according to The A.P., which conducts a survey of party leaders who may serve as delegates and calculates the intentions of unpledged delegates based on the popular vote. But the Republican National Committee says Mr. Romney has 416 delegates, because it does not take unpledged delegates into account.
Mr. Santorum had 252 delegates before Illinois, The A.P. said, while the Republican National Committee count showed him with 170. The 46 at stake on Saturday in Louisiana are his immediate target, and he was to campaign there Wednesday.
Mr. Santorum's campaign said the party was being appropriately conservative with its estimate because the popular vote is a poor barometer and so much of the delegate allocation remains to be sorted out at the local level.
But, the campaign said in a conference call Tuesday, if all of the tallies took into account the results of local conventions that have already taken place, they would give Mr. Santorum a higher number of delegates and Mr. Romney a lower number. Basing its projections on those sorts of results, the Santorum campaign reported that Mr. Romney had 435 delegates, Mr. Santorum 311, Mr. Gingrich 158 and Mr. Paul 91.
Mr. Romney's campaign dismisses the Santorum argument and indicates that its own count gives it an even larger margin. And with Illinois, advisers were preparing to argue on Wednesday that they are at the halfway mark to winning the nomination.

HEADLINE: Bernanke, As Professor, Tries to Buff Fed's Image

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, spent the better part of an hour Tuesday afternoon carefully explaining to a class of college students why the United States abandoned the gold standard in the 1930s.
''Unfortunately gold standards are far from perfect monetary systems,'' he told the class of 30 undergraduates at George Washington University. 
Tying the supply of money to the supply of a precious metal limits a government's ability to address economic problems, Mr. Bernanke explained.
Adopting the gold standard, he said, ''means swearing that no matter how bad unemployment gets you are not going to do anything about it.''
Mr. Bernanke, one of the most powerful men in Washington, has agreed to moonlight as a college professor, delivering four lectures on central banking over the next two weeks. He also will read some student papers.
It is not a typical use of a Fed chairman's time. But Mr. Bernanke, who has greatly expanded the central bank's role in the nation's economic policy, is looking for ways to raise and improve its public profile, too.
The Fed is concerned that it is neither loved nor understood by many Americans, and that public anger could lead to constraints on its powers.
Mr. Bernanke has appeared twice on the CBS News program ''60 Minutes'' and held town-hall meetings with college students and military personnel. Since last year, he has held news conferences after selected meetings of the Fed's policy-making committee. Under his leadership, the Fed has increased the availability of information about its internal deliberations. Earlier this month, the Fed began a Twitter feed.
Mr. Bernanke spoke Tuesday about the history of monetary policy in the United States, including the Fed's creation in 1913, and its role in causing the Great Depression. He framed much of this history as a critique of the gold standard, which was dropped in the early 1930s in a decision that mainstream economists regard as obviously correct, hugely beneficial and essentially irreversible.
Congressman Ron Paul, a Texas Republican who is running for president, has won a loyal following, including among college students, for his campaign to restore a gold standard. In such a system, the availability of money is determined largely by formula -- in proportion to the availability of gold -- rather than the discretion of policy makers.
Mr. Bernanke has treated this advocacy as obviously misguided, generally declining to engage with Mr. Paul at Congressional hearings. But the Fed's longstanding practice of ignoring most critics most of the time has not served it well in recent years, as its aggressive policies have made it the subject of public scrutiny.
So on Tuesday, in careful and simple language, Mr. Bernanke took the time to explain his opposition to the gold standard.
The problem with such a standard, Mr. Bernanke explained, is that it limits the ability of government to address economic problems by adjusting the amount of money circulating in the economy. Proponents see this as an advantage, because they believe that policy makers will do more harm than good, in part by making decisions that prioritize short-term benefits over longer-term costs.
But Mr. Bernanke said that history was clearly on the side of flexible policy. In particular, he described the standard view among economic historians that the rigidity of the gold standard amplified the Great Depression.
He noted that the policies of modern nations tying the value of their currencies to those of other nations have the same downside. He cited the example of China, which maintains the value of its currency in relation to the dollar.
''Fixed exchange rates between countries tend to transmit both good and bad policies between countries and take away the independence those countries have to manage their economic policy,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
Mr. Bernanke taught at Princeton before joining the Federal Reserve in 2002, and he slipped comfortably into his former role as a college professor. He set aside his usual practice as Fed chairman of reading from prepared remarks. He told a few dry jokes. He answered student questions with evident pleasure.
He did not, however, entirely abandon the caution required by his office. He arrived in a suit and tie, looking every inch the Washington bureaucrat, and he skirted questions about current policy, offering brief and familiar boilerplate responses.
The students, who were selected through an essay contest, also did not lose track of the fact that the speaker was not an ordinary professor. Several said they had chosen a school in Washington for the chance at such moments.
''It always surprises you to realize that this guy actually exists and he's not just on TV,'' said Max Sanders, a 19-year-old from New York.
''It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to hear lectures from him,'' said Noah Wiviott, 21, of New Jersey. ''He clearly knows what he's talking about.''
Not everyone, however, found him convincing.
Yuqi Wu, a 20-year-old student from China, said she did not agree with Mr. Bernanke's criticism of her government's monetary policy.
''I definitely support the Chinese government's position,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Dueling Iranian New Year Greetings from Obama and Khamenei

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Artin Afkhami contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The leaders of Iran and the United States issued starkly divergent New Year messages to Iran's home audience on Tuesday, with President Obama calling for a new relationship that would end Iran's prolonged isolation, and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei exhorting fellow citizens to beware of enemy plots and to buy only domestically made products.
In the messages celebrating the Persian New Year, called Nowruz, posted on their respective web sites, Mr. Obama castigated Iranian leaders for seeking to block the free flow of information in Iran, and said that American makers of anti-censorship technology would be exempted from sanctions against selling to Iran. For his part, Ayatollah Khamenei denounced Iran's foes for all of their ''hostile and malevolent attacks'' and announced what amounted to a buy-Iranian campaign to minimize the effects of sanctions, which are increasingly squeezing Iran's economy. 
In Iran, the year that has just concluded -- 1390 in the Persian calendar -- was the ''Year of Economic Jihad,'' the ayatollah said in his Nowruz message. He decreed that the slogan for the new year, 1391, should be ''National Production and Supporting Iranian Labor and Capital.''
''We should become used to consuming every product that is produced inside the country,'' the ayatollah said in his message, which was posted in several languages. With the success of such an effort, he said, ''once again the Iranian nation will manage to overcome the machinations of the enemies and the tricks of the ill-wishers in the economic arena in the year 1391.''
The ayatollah's message implicitly acknowledged the growing deprivations in Iran's economy because of the international sanctions, which have taken aim at the country's banks and oil industry and have become increasingly onerous, contributing to shortages, inflation and unemployment in the country. Many Iranian banks, including the Central Bank, were cut off a few days ago from a global telecommunications network that is an important conduit for financial transactions, and Iran's currency, the rial, has been weakening in value against other currencies.
Mr. Obama's New Year greeting message, in a video clip posted on the White House web site with Persian subtitles, acknowledged the ''continued tensions between our two countries,'' but went on to say that Nowruz was a family occasion that served as a reminder of ''the common humanity that we share.'' ''There's no reason for the United States and Iran to be divided from one another,'' the president said in the message.
He emphasized the positives in the long-strained relationship, including the prosperity of America's Iranian expatriate community, the anti-piracy collaboration of the American and Iranian navies, and Iran's winning entry in this year's Academy Awards, ''A Separation.''
But Mr. Obama's message also criticized the Iranian government for denying its citizens access to information, by blocking the Internet and by monitoring cell phone communications. He noted that technologies that ''should empower citizens are used to repress them.'' Because of such obstructions, it was unclear how many Internet users in Iran would be able to access Mr. Obama's message.
Despite the American sanctions on Iran, Mr. Obama said he was issuing new guidelines to make it easier for American companies to provide software and other products in Iran that would ''make it easier for the Iranian people to use the Internet.''
Each leader spoke against a backdrop of a potential military confrontation over Iran's nuclear energy program, which Western nations and Israel have called a cover for Iran to develop nuclear-weapons capability. Israel, which considers Iran a threat to its existence and is believed to possess nuclear weapons itself, has hinted that it may preemptively attack suspected nuclear sites in Iran. For its part, Iran has insisted that its program is peaceful, and has threatened to retaliate against any perceived hostile act.

HEADLINE: A Measured Rebuttal to China

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and MATTHEW L. WALD; Keith Bradsher reported from Hong Kong and Matthew L. Wald from Washington.

 BODY:
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that it would impose tariffs on solar panels imported from China after concluding that the Chinese government provided illegal export subsidies to manufacturers there.
The tariffs were smaller, at 2.9 to 4.73 percent, than some American industry executives had expected. At that size, their effect on the market could be limited. But additional tariffs could be imposed in May, when the Commerce Department is scheduled to decide whether China is ''dumping'' solar panels into the United States at prices below their actual cost. A finding of dumping would result in additional tariffs that could be far larger than these.
But whatever the size of the penalties, Tuesday's ruling is likely to further heighten trade tensions with China, and to have implications for renewable energy policy in this country.
Although the ruling is the result of a quasi-judicial review process by civil servants in the Commerce Department, the imposition of tariffs by an arm of the Obama administration also seems certain to enter the partisan fray. 
The president's supporters might point to it as evidence that he continues to play tough with Beijing. But opponents, including the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who are already criticizing Mr. Obama for what they say is a low level of attention to China trade issues, might call the small penalties insufficient.
The Commerce Department declined to comment Tuesday.
Li Junfeng, a Chinese government renewable energy policy maker who is also the president of the Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association, a government-backed trade group, welcomed the Commerce Department's decision not to levy heavier tariffs. ''I'm happy that it's not a lot, but not surprised -- the Chinese government does not give too many subsidies to the companies,'' he said.
Whatever political spin proponents or critics might want to put on the tariff decision, there is no question that solar panels from China now control about half of the American market, while panels from the United States control less than a third.
American imports of Chinese solar panels have soared to $2.65 billion last year from $21.3 million in 2005.
While American manufacturers oppose the imports and filed the trade case against China, users of solar energy have benefited from low-cost Chinese solar panels. An American industry group composed of companies that sell and install solar panels said Tuesday that it was pleased with the relatively small size of the tariffs, having braced for higher ones.
''This is a huge victory for the U.S. solar industry and our 100,000 employees,'' said Jigar Shah, president of the Coalition for Affordable Solar Energy. ''Given all our expectations, this is really good news.''
Barry Cinnamon, chief executive of Westinghouse Solar, which imports panels from China and adds wiring, racking and other components, said he was relieved by the decision, which will raise the price of his 250-watt system to about $610 from $600.
''If the tariffs were big, 20 percent or 50 percent or 100 percent, it would be really bad for U.S. jobs,'' he said. ''If it's a small tariff, it does send a signal to encourage manufacturers to do more manufacturing in the U.S., but it's not enough to have a huge impact on costs.'' And it will not set off a trade war, he predicted.
Globally, low-cost Chinese panels have driven down the cost of solar energy by two-thirds in the last four years, narrowing but not eliminating the wide price gap that used to separate solar power from electricity generated by burning fossil fuels.
But the solar energy boom has had few benefits for American manufacturers. The plunging prices led to the bankruptcy of three American solar panel makers last August.
One of the failures was Solyndra, which cost the federal government more than $500 million. Solyndra's collapse has been the subject of an investigation by Congressional Republicans, who contend that the Obama administration should not have lent so much money for an unproved clean energy program.
The Commerce Department decision Tuesday may be the most comprehensive review yet by an American government agency of how China uses subsidies to dominate an industry.
China now has about 700 solar panel manufacturers with a combined annual production capacity of 40 gigawatts of electricity -- the electric power equivalent, at peak sunlight hours, to the total output of every electrical generating station in New York State.
Chinese companies have been able to grow so fast, and cut costs so quickly, because they could take large loans from government-owned banks.
Although Chinese bankers and solar panel executives now deny that those loans were made at subsidized rates, that was a central issue in the Commerce Department's antisubsidy review.
The question facing the Commerce Department was whether the Chinese government's support violated American laws -- and international free trade rules -- meant to prevent countries from spending government money to help exporters buy market share overseas.
A few Chinese companies have acknowledged receiving substantial government assistance. Executives at Hunan Sunzone Optoelectronics, a solar panel manufacturer in Changsha, in south-central China, said in interviews in 2010 that they had been able to buy valuable land near downtown for a third of the citywide rate for industrial land. And the company said that Chinese bankers had offered large loans at just 6 percent interest -- below market rates at the time -- with the provincial government paying much of the interest.
China's huge and growing need for oil imported from volatile countries in the Mideast and Africa has made energy independence one of the country's highest strategic and economic objectives.
Top Chinese officials have talked extensively in recent years about the need to support renewable energy industries. They also have encouraged local and provincial governments to remove regulatory obstacles and have pushed state-owned banks to lend heavily to the sector.
And yet, until very recently, China has not focused on installing solar panels domestically. The factories were primarily geared for export.
Government subsidies are by no means solely a Chinese practice. The United States supported the development of solar energy by offering financial incentives for companies and households to buy solar panels. And many states have put quotas on power companies for the amount of renewable energy they must buy.
But China focused first on developing large-scale manufacturing of solar panels for export, and only in the last year has it started to subsidize the installation of large numbers of panels in China.
The result is that up to 95 percent of China's output in recent years has been exported, leading critics to suggest that China was capitalizing on other countries' solar subsidies. Chinese officials have rejected those suggestions and have hinted that they might retaliate with a trade case against American exports of polysilicon, a material used in manufacturing solar panels.
Ben Santarris, a spokesman for SolarWorld, a leader of the manufacturing coalition that filed the antisubsidy case at the Commerce Department, said that the company still hoped that higher tariffs would come this year. The Commerce Department will continue investigating evidence of Chinese subsidies, and later this year will reassess Tuesday's preliminary ruling.
The Commerce Department assigned a tariff of 2.9 percent to solar cells and panels from Suntech, 4.73 percent to solar cells and panels from Trina Solar and 3.61 percent for products from all other Chinese solar panel makers. The tariffs ''are the first step in a multi-step process, but we believe they are a clear indication Suntech has been managing its business from a competitive perspective,'' said Andrew Beebe, the chief commercial officer of Suntech.
Mr. Li, the Chinese regulator, said that it would be wrong for the Commerce Department to assess any antidumping tariffs on Chinese solar panels in May because panel prices are even lower in China than in the United States.
Some trade experts are already suggesting that the United States and China should look at trade strategies worked out between the United States and Japan in the 1980s to manage Japan's rapid rise as an exporter. These strategies included so-called voluntary export restraints by Japan, which were actually far from voluntary. They included restraints on Japanese cars in 1981 and government-led research efforts like Sematech, which President Reagan helped establish to assist the American semiconductor industry.
''The future of renewable alternative energy, and in this case solar energy, is too important to be left to be 'solved' by litigation,'' said Alan Wolff, a trade official in the Nixon, Ford and Carter administrations who was one of the leading trade lawyers during the struggles with Japan in the 1980s. ''Beijing and Washington have the means to work out a mutually and globally beneficial way to work out a solution to the solar panel trade case.''
The solar panel industry also faces a serious challenge from the plunging price of natural gas in the United States, where new drilling techniques have brought large increases in the amount of gas on the market. The deployment of those same drilling techniques in foreign markets could bring down the price of gas there as well. That could make solar panels seem costly.
The Commerce Department decision is subject to a ruling by the International Trade Commission that the domestic industry has suffered harm from imports. Such decisions usually favor the domestic industry when there have been bankruptcies or mass layoffs. Besides the three bankruptcies in the American solar industry, all last August, at least four of the biggest survivors have also resorted to sizable layoffs in the last two years.
One of the companies, Evergreen Solar, announced in January of last year that it was moving production from Massachusetts to China because the Chinese government was offering more financial support for manufacturers there. But the move came too late to save the company from declaring bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: U.S. Exempts Japan and 10 Other Countries From Sanctions Over Iran Oil

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration on Tuesday exempted Japan and 10 European nations from the prospect of biting sanctions intended to punish countries that continue to buy oil from Iran, but it left open the fate of other major importers, including China, India and South Korea.
The sanctions, ordered by Congress late last year to intensify diplomatic and economic pressure over Iran's nuclear activities, have put the administration in the difficult position of threatening to punish some of the United States' closest allies while it seeks to squeeze Iran's main source of hard currency. 
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who announced the exemptions in a statement, cast them as evidence of the success of the new sanctions because the countries had cut imports. The United States, she said, was making progress in ''shrinking Iran's oil export markets and isolating its Central Bank from the world financial system.''
At a time when Israel has threatened military action against Iran and Republicans have criticized the administration's approach, President Obama has argued that there is still time to resolve international concerns about Iran's nuclear activities through diplomacy and increasingly punishing sanctions.
The latest set of sanctions -- adopted with strong support in Congress despite objections from the administration -- would stop American companies from doing business with any country that continues to buy Iranian oil through that country's Central Bank. The law, however, gives the administration significant room to maneuver to avoid a major disruption in the global oil market and any collateral damage to close American allies.
The European Union has already joined the United States in increasing sanctions on Iran, banning new contracts for fuel in January and phasing out existing ones by July 1. That earned exemptions for Belgium, Britain, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain.
''These actions taken by these countries were not easy,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''They had to rethink their energy needs at a critical time for the world economy and quickly begin to find alternatives to Iranian oil, which many had been reliant on.''
Japan, still struggling in the aftermath of last year's earthquake and nuclear crisis, qualified under a provision that allows the administration to exempt countries that make ''significant reductions'' in Iranian imports. A senior State Department official would not say how much Japan had or would reduce its imports. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of department rules, noted that public data from last year -- before the law took effect -- showed a 15 percent to 22 percent decline in Japanese imports, depending on how they were measured.
In all, 23 countries import Iranian oil, the senior administration official said, meaning 12 more still face the possibility of sanctions. Mrs. Clinton described the countries exempted on Tuesday as ''an initial group.''
A Republican Congressional official cautioned that it was not publicly known how much Japan had agreed to reduce its imports. The amount could influence which other countries receive exemptions and determine the law's ultimate effect, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The bill's sponsors expected ''significant reductions'' to be at least 18 percent, the official said.
China, India and South Korea, together with Japan, import more than 60 percent of Iran's oil, and negotiations with them continue. Under the law, Mr. Obama has until March 28 to waive the sanctions entirely on the grounds that the ban would disrupt the oil markets, a move now not considered likely, and by the end of June to exempt other countries.
''It will calm oil market anxiety by signaling that the administration is going to let some Iranian oil flow,'' said Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, which favors the sanctions. ''The real test is going to be India and China.''
Mr. Obama and Iran's leader issued starkly divergent messages on Tuesday, the Persian New Year, which is called Nowruz. Mr. Obama castigated Iranian leaders for seeking to block the free flow of information in Iran, and said American makers of anticensorship technology would be exempted from sanctions against selling to Iran. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, exhorted citizens to beware of enemy plots and to buy only domestically made products. His message implicitly acknowledged the growing deprivations in Iran's economy because of sanctions.
He said that by consuming every product made in Iran, ''once again the Iranian nation will manage to overcome the machinations of the enemies and the tricks of the ill-wishers in the economic arena in the year 1391.''

HEADLINE: Why Has India Become the World's Top Arms Buyer?

BYLINE: HARI KUMAR


HIGHLIGHT: India overtakes China in arms imports. 

 BODY:
India has replaced China as the world's largest arms buyer, accounting for 10 percent of all arms purchases during the past five years, a Swedish research group said.
India purchased some $12.7 billion in arms, 80 percent of that from Russia, during 2007-2011, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). China's arms purchases during that time were $6.3 billion, 78 percent of which came from Russia.
India has tried, but failed, to create a sizable domestic manufacturing industry for weapons or even basic military goods, while China has increased production of defense supplies. About 75 percent of India's weapons purchases came from imports during 2007-11, said Laxman Kumar Behra of the Institute of Defense Studies and Analysis, a government-funded research organization. 
Some analysts in India attribute the failure to create a domestic defense industry to government involvement. "India's public sector is very inefficient and the private sector is by and large kept out of arms production," Mr. Behra said.
"We lack long-term vision," and a culture of research and development, Mr. Behra said. "The government keeps on forming one committee after the other but there is hardly any implementation" of the committee's recommendations, he said.
In a recent article in The Economic Times, Uday Bhaskar, a retired commodore and leading strategic analyst, also criticized India's weapons procurement policy.
"More than 60 years after becoming a republic and 50 years after the debacle with China, the opaque Indian defense production establishment does not produce high quality clothing and personal inventory items like boots, let alone a suitable rifle for a one million army, or tanks and aircraft."
Russia, the world's No. 2 weapons supplier in recent years after the United States, sold $7.8 billion in defense supplies in 2011, and $40.8 billion from 2005 to 2011. India bought about one-third of the supplies.
India's dependence on Russia is a holdover from the Cold War era, when the two were close allies. 
South Korea was the second-largest arms importer from 2007 to 2011, with $7 billion in purchases. Pakistan and China followed, each accounting for about 5 percent of the world's total arms import during the five-year period, SIPRI said.
India's import of major weapons increased by 38 percent from the 2002-2006 period to the 2007-2011 period. India's main acquisitions over the past five years were 120 Sukhoi and 16 MiG-29 jet fighter aircraft from Russia and 20 Anglo-French Jaguar fighters.
India recently finalized a deal for 126 multi-role fighter aircraft with French defense contractor Rafael, in a deal worth $10 billion.

HEADLINE: Reconciling Gandhi With Ambedkar

BYLINE: SARAH KHAN


HIGHLIGHT: Exploring the complicated, complimentary relationship between India's founding fathers. 

 BODY:
Mohandas K. Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar were the men of the hour at Columbia University on Tuesday evening. 
An audience of hundreds packed the rotunda of the historic Low Library for the lecture, "Reconciling Gandhi with Ambedkar," hosted by the Columbia Law School Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Chair in Constitutional Law. Jagdish Bhagwati, a Columbia professor and leading Indian economist, introduced historian Ramachandra Guha of the London School of Economics, who went on to detail a complicated yet complementary relationship between two of India's dynamic founding fathers.
According to Professor Guha, while both Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Ambedkar fought against the caste system -- a form of human taxonomy Professor Guha deemed "the most sophisticated, subtle, and diabolical form of social exclusion and discrimination invented by human beings" -- their approaches were vastly different. Mr. Gandhi, an upper-caste member of the elite, challenged the caste system from above, in its highest echelons, as Mr. Ambedkar, the 14th child of a Dalit sepoy in the Indian Army, challenged it from below. And while Mr. Gandhi's views on caste evolved slowly over the years, he remained deeply spiritual and sought social change within Hinduism. Mr. Ambedkar, on the other hand, favored using the state as an instrument for establishing forward-thinking social policies. Though he was born a Hindu, he often swore he wouldn't die one, and, true to his word, he converted to Buddhism along with 200,000 of his followers weeks before his death in 1956. 
The results of their differing perspectives, according to Professor Guha? "We've made more progress in the last 60 years than in the last 5,000 years."
Professor Guha said that Mr. Ambedkar's selection as an architect of the Constitution was truly ahead of its time: "that a person who, under traditional Hindu law was not allowed into someone's home, was now writing the Constitution, was as radical a step as Barack Obama becoming president of the United States 60 years later."
This was just one of the comparisons Professor Guha drew to the United States, whose spirit of egalitarianism he lauded on more than one occasion. But most importantly, he said, all Indians should be inspired by visionaries like Mr. Ambedkar, just as "to admire Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., or Rosa Parks, you don't have to be a Republican or Democrat, you just have to be American."
It's fitting that the government of India endowed Columbia University with a chair devoted to Mr. Ambedkar, since he had obtained masters and doctoral degrees from the institution. "Reconciling Gandhi with Ambedkar" was the first of a three-part lecture seriesbeing led by Professor Guha this week. "Sport and the Nation: Interpreting Indian History through the Lens of Cricket," will be held on Wednesday, followed by "The Past and Future of Indian Democracy" on Thursday.
But while he will go on to explore many facets of Indian society through his lectures this week, on Tuesday night Professor Guha's focus was two men who may not have seen eye to eye, but whose contributions to modern India were invaluable. "They should both be heroes," he said. "Why must we diminish one figure to praise another? India today needs Gandhi and Ambedkar both."

HEADLINE: Americans Split Over Whether Recovery Will Endure

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Americans are evenly divided about whether the recovery will continue through the rest of 2012, a survey finds. 

 BODY:
Despite recent improvements in the economy, Americans are divided about whether the upswing will continue for the rest of this year, In fact, Americans are split about evenly, a new surveyshows.
About half of those surveyed are confident that the recovery will last through 2012, and half are not, according to Bankrate's Financial Security Index survey for March.
The telephone survey of 1,006 adults, conducted in March by Princeton Survey Research Associates International, has a margin of sampling error of four percentage points.
Differences in outlook depended on age and income. Consumers who are more comfortable with their level of savings and debt now, compared with a year ago, tend to be under age 50, have a college education and annual household income of $75,000 of above.
Those who are less comfortable about their savings and debt, however, tend to be 50 and older, have no more than a high school education and household income of less than $30,000.
And among retirees, those saying their financial situation is worse now than a year ago outnumber those saying it is better by about three to one.
Even though unemployment has declined to 8.3 percent, job security still weighs on the outlook of many Americans. The survey found that 21 percent feel more secure about their jobs than a year ago -- an improvement over a low of 13 percent reported in November. Yet, about the same proportion -- 20 percent -- say they feel less secure about their jobs. (The majority of consumers said they felt about the same.)
Do you feel you are better off financially than you were a year ago? Are you optimistic that the economic recovery will continue?

HEADLINE: What Radulov's Departure Means for the K.H.L.

BYLINE: JEFF Z. KLEIN


HIGHLIGHT: Alexander Radulov is just the latest star to leave the K.H.L., prompting questions about the league's future. 

 BODY:
Alexander Radulov's return to Nashville has touched off a torrent of speculation about a variety of subjects: how angry other N.H.L. general managers are because the Predators are being allowed to add him to their playoff lineup after the roster freeze; how he has skipped out of the bulk of his entry-level contract by playing abroad since 2008 ("He gets his cake and eats it too," Blues G.M. Doug Armstrong said last week.); and how he may disappoint on the ice simply because he is from the K.H.L.
But one thing that hasn't been discussed is what Radulov's departure means for the K.H.L. The Russian league has come a long, humbling way since Radulov joined it in 2008. Back then, the K.H.L. had ambitions to expand throughout Europe and Asia, convinced it would soon challenge the N.H.L. for a share of hockey supremacy. Those dreams never came to fruition, and today the K.H.L. is riddled with financial problems and safety issues at the rink and in air travel. Perhaps most telling of all, it has lost its biggest stars.
Is the K.H.L., as the Novaya Gazeta writer Vladimir Mozgovoi put it Monday, now "a league without a face?"
The quality of K.H.L. hockey is much better than most North American observers give it credit for. Skeptics of the K.H.L. would do well to remember that in the three meetings between N.H.L. and K.H.L. teams to date, the N.H.L. is 2-1. The Rangers had a last-minute 4-3 win over Metallurg Magnitogorsk in Switzerland in 2008, and Phoenix won, 3-1, at Dinamo Riga in 2010; SKA St. Petersburg beat visiting Carolina, 5-3, in a 2010 game marred by mutual accusations of dirty play.
Two K.H.L. stars who have returned to North America, Jaromir Jagr in Philadelphia and Evgeny Nabokov with the Islanders, have excelled in the N.H.L. this season. (In fact, Nabokov has been way sharper with the Islanders than he was last year with SKA St. Petersburg.) Other K.H.L. stars, like Jiri Hudler and Ray Emery, came back to the N.H.L. last season and resumed their former role as midlevel players.
The track record is there for Radulov to at least pick up where he left off in the N.H.L., as a strong second-line player (he had 26 goals and 32 assists in 81 games in his second season with the Predators, 2007-8). There is a good chance he will be an effective top-liner as well. On Wednesday he practiced on a line with Patric Hornqvist, the Preds' top goal scorer, and David Legwand.
Radulov has left open the possibility of returning to Salavat Yulaev Ufa in the K.H.L. next season, but it is at least even money that he has left the Russian league behind for the foreseeable future. There were plenty of complaints that he did not try hard enough in Salavat's first-round playoff exit, including from Coach Vener Safin. Judging from message boards in Ufa, fans there are not sorry to see Radulov go.
It was only in 2008 that the K.H.L., buoyed by the arrival of Jagr and Radulov and Russia's own economic growth, was talking about expansion into the rest of Europe, China, Korea and Japan. 
"North America's too small," said Slava Fetisov, the Russian minister of sport. "Europe is the future. That's where the tradition, and the players, and the fans are."
Vladimir Putin spoke of the K.H.L. as "an instrument of Russian foreign policy." Alexander Medvedev, the K.H.L. president, was also deputy chairman of Gazprom; while he was reorganizing the league, he was also managing the cutoff of natural gas exports to Ukraine. Wealth was consolidated in a strong central government, as oligarchs were pushed out or brought under Putin's control. K.H.L. clubs like Salavat Yulaev were owned and operated by local governments' oil and natural gas companies, paying out big contracts to stars like Radulov despite operating the teams at a deficit.
Meanwhile, there was bold talk in Russia of bringing top European domestic clubs into the K.H.L., teams like Eisbren Berlin and Jokerit Helsinki. It even got to the point where Medvedev proposed a 56-team, continent-spanning superleague. "The league will expand in Europe, which I think is great for hockey in Europe," said Barry Smith, then the SKA coach.
That was all part of a big mid-decade surge in Russian sports; rinks and stadiums were built across the country, and top soccer clubs excelled in European competitions for the first time since the Brezhnev years. The country's booming energy wealth helped win it the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2018 World Cup.
But then the global recession hit, and the K.H.L.'s big plans were put on hold. Stories started to emerge of missed paychecks. Historic teams had to drop out for a season (Spartak Moscow), reorganize (Dynamo Moscow) or fold altogether (Lada Togliatti). Gross shortcomings in basic medical safety protocols emerged with the death of Alexei Cherepanov in 2008, and air safety issues in 2011 with the plane crash that killed the Lokomotiv team. For many around the world, the defining image of Russian hockey became scenes of a snowy graveyard in Yaroslavl.
And now this season, two of the men who lent the K.H.L. legitimacy, Jagr and Radulov, have returned to the N.H.L. The expected rush of stars to the new Russian league never materialized -- largely, no doubt, because of the safety and financial solvency issues that have gotten so many headlines over the last four years.
Certainly the K.H.L. has put Russian domestic hockey on firmer ground than it has been in quite a long time. The league is slicker and more fan-friendly than any of its predecessors in Russian or Soviet domestic hockey. The rinks are bigger and newer. It has ended the mass exodus of young Russian prospects to the N.H.L.; no longer can an N.H.L. club hope to get an Evgeni Malkin or an Alex Ovechkin for a mere $200,000.
But the K.H.L.'s bigger dreams of four years ago have gone the way of Russia's bigger dreams, tempered now by economic realities. Gone are the days when a veteran star like Jagr, or a young star like Radulov, would go to Russia and not look back.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Split Focus

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
Illinois primary voters decided on Tuesday that Mitt Romney had a better chance than other Republican candidates of beating President Obama in November, Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg wrote. But with his rivals showing no signs of stepping aside as the contest bounds to the next battleground, Louisiana, Mr. Romney cannot afford to turn his full focus to Mr. Obama for at least two months, they write.
After Louisiana's primary on Saturday, the Republican candidates are headed into a series of expensive primaries in the Northeast. And with deep-pocketed Republican donors sitting on the sidelines, the candidates are increasingly reliant on a small group of supporters funneling millions to secretive political action committees to keep them in the race, Nicholas Confessore writes.
The Senate put off for a day consideration of the so-called JOBS bill, as Democrats and Republicans squabbled Tuesday over disclosure requirements for businesses seeking to raise capital from private investors and over the re-authorization of the Export-Import Bank.
In a move considered tantamount to a high-stakes political bet that worries over the deficit will trump concern for programs like Medicare, House Republicans unveiled a budget on Tuesday that relies on sharp cuts and drastic changes in domestic spending to balance the federal budget over time, Jonathan Weisman writes. 
Happening in Washington:
The National Association of Realtors releases existing home sales for February at 10 a.m.
Beginning at 9:30, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner are scheduled to testify at a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing focused on the implication for the United States in Europe's debt crisis.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will meet with the Afghan foreign minister, Zalmai Rassoul, at 11:30 and then attend a State Department luncheon celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Afghan Women's Council. At 2 p.m., she will meet with the Croatian foreign minister, Vesna Pusic.
At 2:30 p.m., Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, will honor Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland as the longest-serving woman in Congress, with more than 35 years in the House and Senate. On Saturday she she surpassed the record held by Representative Edith Nourse Rogers At 5 p.m, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, will convene a Womens History Month reception honoring Ms. Mikulski's milestone.

HEADLINE: Memo to House Republican Leaders: Stay Out of It

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: Chris Chocola, president of the fiscal conservative group Club for Growth, has sent a letter to House leaders imploring them to stay neutral in a House primary between two Republican freshmen in Arizona. 

 BODY:
To: Republican House Leadership
From: Club for Growth
Re: Arizona Republican House Primary
Subject: Mind Your Own Beeswax!
Just after a House Republican freshman trumped a senior lawmaker in the Illinois primary -- a race that Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, weighed in on in a rather extraordinary manner -- Chris Chocola, president of the fiscal conservative group Club for Growth, sent a letter to House leaders imploring them to stay out of an upcoming primary between Representatives Ben Quayle and David Schweikert, two freshman lawmakers facing off in Arizona.
In the Illinois race, Mr. Cantor supported Representative Adam Kinzinger over a two-decade incumbent, Representative Donald A. Manzullo, with both a written endorsement and contributions from his political action committee. On Tuesday, Mr. Kinzinger was victorious in the race, winning 56 percent of the vote to Mr. Manzullo's 44 percent. The two were drawn into competition after Congressional redistricting resulted in the loss of Mr. Kinzinger's district, and the creation of a new Republican-packed district in the state.
In the Club for Growth letter, addressed to to Mr. Cantor, House Speaker John A. Boehner and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House whip, Mr. Chocola cites donations by Mr. Boehner's own action committee to Mr. Quayle's campaign and insists that the speaker give the same to Mr. Schweikert. Mr. Chocola also asks that the House leaders either stay neutral in the race or prepare for Club for Growth to make a move.
"Should it become apparent that you are choosing sides on behalf of Rep. Quayle," Mr. Chocola wrote, "the Club for Growth PAC will consider it necessary to intervene on behalf of Rep. Schweikert."
Mr. Chocola has been a thorn in the side of the House leadership this year, urging Republican members to vote against many bills they support.

HEADLINE: Jeb Bush Backs Romney and Urges End to G.O.P. Battle

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney received a major boost by getting the endorsement of former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. 

 BODY:
 11:20 a.m. | Updated CHICAGO -- Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said Wednesday that he was endorsing Mitt Romney's bid for the Republican presidential nomination, and urged his party to bring the divisive primary to a close and coalesce behind Mr. Romney's candidacy.
 A day after a sweeping victory here in the Illinois primary, where Mr. Romney overwhelmed Rick Santorum in the popular vote and delegates, Mr. Bush is the latest influential Republican leader to urge the party to rally behind Mr. Romney. Several other leading voices in the party are expected to follow suit in the coming days, aides to Mr. Romney said, in an effort to build a movement to gently urge the three remaining candidates to not block Mr. Romney's path to the nomination.
"Now is the time for Republicans to unite behind Governor Romney and take our message of fiscal conservatism and job creation to all voters this fall," Mr. Bush said in a statement announcing his endorsement.
 "We face huge challenges," Mr. Bush added, "and we need a leader who understands the economy, recognizes more government regulation is not the answer, believes in entrepreneurial capitalism and works to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to succeed."
 Mr. Romney flew to Washington on Wednesday for a fund-raising events, where he was also poised to urge members of Congress and influential lobbyists to support his candidacy and begin publicly calling for an end to the primary fight.
 Mr. Bush declined to endorse Mr. Romney during the Florida primary almost two months ago because he believed Mr. Romney had not demonstrated he was the strongest nominee. An associate of his said Wednesday that Mr. Bush remains troubled by Mr. Romney's rhetoric on immigration, but believes he is the strongest candidate and the primary has run its course.
 The endorsement also served to squelch any lingering chatter that Mr. Bush could still jump into the race if Mr. Romney faltered. He had long told friends that he had no plans to do so.
 Mr. Romney, who spoke to Mr. Bush by telephone on Wednesday morning, said he was grateful for the support and hoped it would help unify Republicans around his candidacy.
 "He has long demonstrated an outstanding ability to bring people together," Mr. Romney said in a statement. He added, "This is a key moment in the presidential contest and Jeb's counsel and support will be critical in the coming months in my effort to defeat Barack Obama and turn around our country."

HEADLINE: If Only He Could Shake His Comment Away

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: A top Romney campaign aide causes a stir by suggesting that the campaign may shift toward moderation. 

 BODY:
There is, perhaps, no more enduring critique of Mitt Romney than the one about him having shaky principles that shift with the political winds.
So it may not have been particularly helpful when one of his top advisers on Wednesday suggested that Mr. Romney's campaign views the Republican race as an Etch A Sketch toy that can be shaken up and redrawn from scratch.
"Well, I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign," Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, said on CNN. "Everything changes. It's almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again."
An Etch A Sketch? The toy where nothing is permanent? Where one picture makes way for another with a few shakes by a 2-year-old?
It took mere minutes for Mr. Romney's rivals to - gleefully - seize on the potential metaphors.
"We've been saying it for months, and Mitt Romney has had a reputation for it for years: he'll say or do anything to get elected - absolutely anything," wrote Brad Woodhouse, the communications director for the Democratic National Committee, in an e-mail with the subject line: "An Etch A Sketch? Really??"
Mr. Woodhouse added: "Now his own top adviser has confirmed that Mitt Romney has absolutely no core and will in fact say anything to get elected. In fact - his positions are no more reliable than if they were written on an Etch A Sketch - which is exactly what Eric Fehrnstrom compared them to. Incredible." 
The dumping on Mr. Fehrnstrom was a bipartisan affair.
The subject line on the e-mail from Rick Santorum's campaign was in all caps: "***SHOCKING VIDEO EMBEDDED*** LIKE AN ETCH A SKETCH ... TEAM ROMNEY ADMITS THEIR CANDIDATE WILL CHANGE POSITIONS IN THE GENERAL ELECTION."
Hogan Gidley, a spokesman for Mr. Santorum, added: "We all knew Mitt Romney didn't have any core convictions, but we appreciate his staff going on national television to affirm that point for anyone who had any doubts."
And moments later, Bill Burton, who runs a "super PAC" backing President Obama's campaign, sent an e-mail titled "Etch A Sketch voters?"
"While extraordinarily cynical," Mr. Burton wrote, "this candid admission of Governor Romney's general election strategy to mislead the American people does at least have the benefit of truth. There is no doubt Governor Romney is going to try to mask his right-wing, anti-middle class agenda in order to win the election."
Asked whether he wanted to take the words back, Mr. Fehrnstrom e-mailed what apparently is what he wished had come out of his mouth in the first place.
"As we move from the primary to the general election, the campaign changes," Mr. Fehrnstrom wrote. "It's a different race, with different candidates, and the main issue now becomes President Obama's failure to create jobs and get this economy moving."
Despite that explanation, Mr. Fehrnstrom's comment quickly became fodder in the Twitter universe.
Tim Carvell, who identifies himself as a "writer of comedy jokes for the TV box" living in New York, wrote, "Right now, I'm guessing the Romney adviser who compared his candidate to an Etch a Sketch is being turned upside down and shaken vigorously."

HEADLINE: The Common Sense Catholics

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Santorum isn't winning his fellow Catholics - far from it. 

 BODY:
Rick Santorum doesn't just wear his religion on his sleeve, he billboards it in neon. Still, for all the flash and sparks generated by an ostentatiously Catholic candidate's crusade for the presidency, one thing has been missing from most discussions: the actual Catholic voter.
But with Tuesday's primary results, we now have extensive exit polling from three major states in the Catholic belt across the Midwest. The verdict from Michigan, Ohio and now Illinois is consistent: a majority of Republican Catholic voters are giving a thumb's down to Santorum.
In Illinois, where more than a third of Tuesday's Republican electorate was Catholic according to the exit polls, Santorum lost the Catholic vote by a what-part-of-no-don't-you-understand 23 points - a much bigger margin than with all voters.
In Ohio and Michigan, Santorum also did worse among Catholics than he did with the overall primary participants. Mitt Romney barely beat Santorum in Ohio, 38 percent to 37 percent. Catholic voters made the difference for him: he crushed Santorum with that share of the vote, 44 percent to 31 percent.
The same pattern held in Michigan, which Romney won by 41 percent to 38 percent. Santorum won the evangelical vote, but Catholics carried the day for Romney: he got 44 percent to Santorum's 37.
This trend followed in a state with a majority share of Catholics in the primary electorate, Massachusetts, where Romney won them 75 percent to 12 percent (of course, it's one of his home states). And in heavily Catholic Puerto Rico as well, Santorum was overwhelmed.
If Romney has indeed finally sealed the deal after Tuesday, he will owe his nomination in large part to common-sense Catholics who rejected a less rational one of their own.
Three other takeaway points:
Santorum's far-right Catholicism will not put the Catholic vote in the Republican column in November. Barack Obama won Catholics 54-47, just slightly better than he did over all. Catholics, as with most of the population, are not buying into the dour 13th-century philosophy of Santorum regarding women, their bodies and reproductive practices. Even conservative Catholics - who make up nearly a third of the Republican electorate - are not buying it. Imagine if Democratic Catholics - the majority of the faith, based on 2008 - had their say on this guy.
A test case of the Santorum effect was the Pennsylvania Senate race of 2006. Senator Santorum lost the Catholic vote in his home state by a whopping 18 points to a Catholic Democrat, Robert Casey Jr.
If the Catholic vote is in play in November, it will be because of the economy, or some other issue that is bothering most Americans. Catholics are an almost perfect mirror of the general electorate. They voted for George W. Bush 52 percent to 47, compared to the 51-48 percent outcome. And this was against the first major party Catholic nominee, John Kerry, on the ballot in 44 years.
The vote for John F. Kennedy, the nation's first Catholic president, was as much cultural as religious - he was militantly secular in outlook, but represented the high point of Irish-Catholic aspiration.
Santorum, to the disgust of many who follow St. Peter's faith, said that Kennedy's famous speech on the separation of church and state made him want to vomit. Anybody else feel that way? If there was a widespread reappraisal of Kennedy's view following Santorum's lead, it would be reflected in votes this year. It's not. The only way to read the results is Catholic rejection of a Catholic retrograde.
In trying to explain this, Santorum says he does better among Catholics who attend church frequently and follow the dictates of Rome. "We do well among people who take their faith seriously," he said earlier this week. True. The problem for him is that a majority of American Catholics don't listen to their bishops, and they vote their conscience. The Jesuit-educated among them, you could argue, have been trained for independent thinking - precisely the kind of voter who finds Santorum lacking in reason, logic and a broad view of humanity.
Second, the fact that most Catholics would vote for a Mormon, while evangelical Protestants - Santorum's true base - would not, says a lot about his followers. National polls show that those who consider Romney's religion a problem are more likely to be evangelical Christians, again, Santorum's followers. They're religious bigots; there's no other way to say it.
Many, if not most, of these same Santorum evangelicals make up a significant percentage of the Republican base who still think - in the worst kind of reality-denial - that Obama is a Muslim. In Alabama and Mississippi 45 percent believed that fantasy based on polling just before the recent primary.
More polling shows that a large percentage of Santorum Republicans continue to live in a fact-free bubble on other questions. In Illinois, 39 percent of Republicans said Obama was a Muslim and 36 percent said he was not an American. For good measure, 43 percent said they did not believe in evolution.
Not long ago, when a woman at a Santorum event wondered how someone who "is an avowed Muslim" could be president, Santorum did nothing to correct the badly misinformed voter. And just a few days ago, in Louisiana, Santorum applauded a preacher, the Rev. Dennis Terry, who said "America was founded as a Christian nation," and those who were not Christian should leave.
Such talk is willful nonsense, but it runs through our history. The majority of Catholic voters, bless 'em, have rejected the crazies pooled behind Rick Santorum.

HEADLINE: The 'I Know Nothing' Defense

BYLINE: MICHAEL W. PEREGRINE


HIGHLIGHT: Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz had argued that they "knew nothing" of Bernie Madoff's fraud. Michael W. Peregrine, a partner at the law firm of McDermott Will &#038; Emery, says their settlement with the Madoff trustee may prompt overreaction by officers and directors. 

 BODY:
The time-honored "I know nothing" defense has less credence for officers and directors of corporations. That is at least one message from the settlement announced Monday between Irving H. Picard, the trustee overseeing recovery for the victims of the Bernard L. Madoff fraud, and the Mets owners Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz.
Before the settlement, Mr. Picard was pursuing a suit accusing the two of being willfully blind to signs that Mr. Madoff was running a scam. Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz had argued that they "knew nothing" of Mr. Madoff's fraud even though they were close friends of Mr. Madoff's before he pleaded guilty to the Ponzi scheme.
The image of Sergeant Schultz, the bumbling prison camp guard from "Hogan's Heroes," has always been good for a boardroom chuckle, but being liable for "willful blindness" remains a serious issue from a corporate governance perspective. 
Willful blindness is an aggressive doctrine, applied to place blame in both civil and criminal cases. The latest settlement may embolden its future use in a fiduciary duty cases, increasing the pressure on officers and directors.
It's a seductive theory of liability, because it is subject to a highly subjective analysis, especially in cases where the facts look bad and real harm has occurred. This is particularly the case with officers and directors - and the buck has to stop at someone's desk. As the thinking goes, "Hey, you were the chief executive or chairman - you had to have known. Or if you didn't, were you choosing to turn a blind eye?"
To paraphrase Judge Jed S. Rakoff, who was overseeing the Madoff proceedings, willful blindness takes place when participants know the odds are high that if they paid attention, they may learn something that may make their actions improper or illegal.
Recent judicial decisions suggest such a doctrine can be applied in limited ways -- to situations involving something similar to actual knowledge of the relevant facts, and deliberate action to avoid confirming a high likelihood of wrongdoing. In other words, willful blindness is a world of difference from mere negligence or recklessness. In such cases, a high burden of proof is justifiably required.
The doctrine takes on a different perspective in the current corporate environment, where finger-pointing and attempts to assert individual responsibility continue to be the order of the day. This is especially the case where regulators increasingly seek to hold corporate officers and directors responsible for an organization's wrongdoing. In addition, public opinion also seeks to place the blame, and punishment, for the problems and fraud that have come to light in the wake of the financial crisis and recession.
Even the extension of business judgment rule protection to corporate officers has recently been questioned by federal courts. There is increasingly a pitchfork mentality when it comes to the liability profile of officers and directors. 
Seen through this lens, the Mets-Madoff settlement may lead to aggressive use, if not actual abuse, of the willful blindness doctrine. 
It could be implied that the Mets owners settled the Madoff trustee's case because they did not want to take their chances with the jury on the willful blindness allegations - in spite of Judge Rakoff's public skepticism that the trustee could prevail at trial. A case involving unsympathetic defendants, a relationship with the disgraced Mr. Madoff, bad facts and a slippery theory of liability all seem to have combined to prompt a settlement. 
But willful blindness could be used as a sledgehammer against the leadership of a corporation in legal or financial distress, even if the officers and directors appear to have acted responsibly.
Such a precedent could be counterproductive for corporate governance. If more cases use willful blindness theories, it could prompt extreme but understandable overreaction by officers and directors. They will be increasingly motivated to refer even marginally suspicious developments to risk management. "I'm not getting tagged with this one; pass it right to legal," or so the thinking may go.
The result is that "covering one's tail" may become more standard fiduciary conduct, and the oversight process will become clogged by information overload. This may have the perverse result of limiting the ability of the lawyers and compliance officers to catch the "really big one" amid excessive officer and director disclosure.
As we look at the evolving liability issues for corporate directors and executives, the settlement with the Mets will further stir the already turbulent waters of fiduciary risk. Excessive caution may lead to boardroom and compliance stagnation. The public policy benefits of sharpened governance oversight will be overwhelmed by the governance costs of perceived self-protection.
Carlos Beltran famously took a called strike three on a close pitch in the final game of the 2006 NLCS, with drastic implications for the Mets' future. Here, the settlement by Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz was a swing at another kind of close pitch, and the implications may be similarly drastic -- not only for the Mets, but also for corporate governance.

HEADLINE: Santorum Plays to His Audience, Toy in Hand

BYLINE: SUSAN SAULNY


HIGHLIGHT: Wielding an Etch A Sketch toy on stage in Mandeville, La., on Wednesday, Rick Santorum made a mockery of Mitt Romney's campaign, pointing out that he would not be redrawn. 

 BODY:
MANDEVILLE, La. - Wielding a classic red Etch A Sketch toy on stage before a crowd of Tea Party supporters on Wednesday, Rick Santorum made a mockery of Mitt Romney's campaign, pointing out that he would not be redrawn.
"This is the first of what I'm now going to call my Etch A Sketch tour of America," Mr. Santorum said to wild applause. He laughed; he shook the toy. He was literally playing before the crowd.
"I'm a candidate who stands firmly on the rock of freedom, not on the sands of an Etch A Sketch," Mr. Santorum said. "Make that difference, reset this race. Give us a chance."
"If you do that, you do your work," he continued, "we win Louisiana. We'll start this race again, and we'll be on the road to nominating a conservative, and when we nominate a conservative, we will defeat Barack Obama and change this country."
The playfulness Mr. Santorum was able to inject into his stump speech thanks to the Etch A Sketch provided some needed levity to a campaign that was slumping a bit after its second-place finish in the Illinois primary on Tuesday. Mr. Santorum began the day in Louisiana on Wednesday on a flat note, speaking to a crowd of no more than two dozen people about the economy. He stressed what he called the need for more oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, to provide jobs and stimulate the local economy.
But Mr. Santorum did not hit his stride until he crossed Lake Pontchartrain and re-emerged before the Northshore Tea Party with his new Etch A Sketch.
It was his moment to seize.
Earlier on Wednesday, a senior adviser to the Romney campaign had said that Mr. Romney would "hit a reset button" for the fall campaign, and would change as a candidate, "almost like an Etch A Sketch." 
In contrast to his earlier appearance, Mr. Santorum was more animated, and the response he got from the crowd - perhaps 250 people - was much more enthusiastic.
At one point, the audience broke into a chant, screaming, "Rick, Rick, Rick!"
They laughed, too.

HEADLINE: The Convention of '76

BYLINE: ADAM CLYMER


HIGHLIGHT: Both the similarities and the differences between the current Republican campaign and the Reagan-Ford battle are telling. 

 BODY:
As the Republican race goes on longer and longer, with Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich hoping to keep Mitt Romney from getting to their convention in Tampa with enough delegates to lock up the nomination, there's a wary sense of excitement among reporters whose fondest dream is of a convention where a nominee is actually chosen, instead of merely being royally acknowledged. So it's worth thinking back to 1976, the last time a race was actually settled at a Republican convention.
It's not a rerun, but there are a lot of similarities, starting with two faux Ronald Reagans (Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich) and a latter-day Gerald R. Ford (Mitt Romney), backed by the party establishment and repeatedly pushed to the right of where he was comfortable. President Ford was the incumbent who, like Romney, excited nobody.
The 1976 battle, like today's, had twists and turns. Reagan seemed ahead, then Ford, the Reagan came back. Of course the shifts in the days before 24-hour news, Twitter, or even e-mail were not as rapid as this year's frantic changes.
That race, like today's, had its appeals for unity. After Ford won Illinois (by a much bigger margin than Romney did Tuesday), his camp started organizing appeals for Reagan to drop out and unite Republicans. Reagan refused. He claimed that getting 40 percent in the state where he was born was a fine showing. Then he won the next primary in North Carolina, his first win, and launched his comeback.
In 1976, there were no super PACs courtesy of the Citizens United decision. But thanks to the court's ruling earlier that year in Buckley v. Valeo, there were PACs from business and labor at work. Even more important, that campaign foreshadowed the super PACs, as outside money not controlled by the campaign was also legitimized by Buckley. The American Conservative Union spent about $16,000 on the first "independent expenditure" radio and newspaper ads, saying that Ford wanted to give away the Panama Canal and that Reagan would keep it.
And 1976 certainly had the toughest intra-party ad wars, at least until this year. Reagan's televised speeches said Ford's foreign policy was weak, perhaps craven, in the face of the Soviet Union. Even the very fact of his challenging the incumbent (if unelected) president from his own party was strikingly un-Republican behavior, reminiscent in 1976 of the Democratic challenges to President Lyndon B. Johnson by Eugene J. McCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy eight years earlier.
The Ford campaign was even tougher on Reagan. Its nuclear weapon was an ad conceived by Stuart Spencer, who knew Reagan's weaknesses from having run his winning campaigns for governor of California in 1966 and 1970. It showed a hand reaching for a voting lever while the voice-over warned: "When you vote Tuesday, remember, Governor Ronald Reagan couldn't start a war. President Ronald Reagan could."
Craig Shirley, author of the most thorough study of that race, "Reagan's Revolution: The Untold Story of the Campaign That Started It All," told me recently, "That commercial was tougher than anything being produced by the Republican ad hacks of today, because it was better conceived, better written and better produced because Spencer was smarter and tougher than the milquetoasts working in today's Republican politics."
The chances of the 2012 race being settled at the convention are magnified by the fact that four candidates are dividing the delegates. In 1976 there were only two, but enough delegates were uncommitted, or controlled by a state party boss like Mississippi's Clarke Reed, to leave Reagan and Ford short of a majority when they reached Kansas City, though Ford was close.
As president, Ford had crucial favors to give away, from meals at the White House to seats on the deck of a carrier, the Forrestal, anchored in New York harbor, where he reviewed tall ships on July 4, 1976, the nation's bicentennial. At the convention his forces repeatedly surrendered to Reagan's team on platform issues, unwilling to risk floor votes that would confirm Spencer's view, as he put it recently, that "Even then, Reagan owned the heart of the Republican Party." In the end, Ford eked out a victory.
This time, much of the chatter about the consequences of the prolonged fight focuses on whether Republicans will settle their differences and back whoever is ultimately nominated. Republicans answer that Hillary Rodham Clinton's voters turned out for Barack Obama in 2008.
That's not a particularly convincing argument, because there were no intense ideological differences between Obama and Clinton, not of the kind hard-core conservatives see between Romney and Santorum. The biggest was probably her support for and his opposition to an individual mandate in health insurance. Most of what animosity there was came from staffers, not voters.
Certainly the differences between Santorum and Romney backers are deeper and more philosophical than those between Obama and Clinton. They are more like the divisions between Reagan and Ford, when the party's conservatives, having lost the Goldwater election, were disappointed with Nixon and Ford for being not conservative enough - just as the Republican right now looks back at George W. Bush and sees him embodying big government.
And there was plenty of talk in 1976 that Republicans would fail to unite behind Ford. But they did.
The 1976 CBS News exit poll showed that only 11 percent of Republicans defected to Jimmy Carter, while 20 percent of the much more numerous Democrats went for Ford.
Spencer, 85, retired and living in Palm Desert, Calif., thinks the same thing will happen in 2012, because antipathy, even hatred, for Obama will unify Republicans. "The intensity of the dislike of Obama on the Republican side is pretty deep," he said. "It runs across the whole spectrum."
He's very likely right. Republicans don't, in the end, defect. That's as true these days as it was in 1976. The 2008 exit poll showed only 9 percent of Republican votes going to Obama. And in the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, only 5 percent of Republicans said they would vote for Obama over Romney, or over Santorum either.
Spencer acknowledged that some die-hard supporters of whoever does not get the nomination might stay at home in November. That was something of a problem in 1976. But this time, "I just don't happen to believe that will happen." Besides, he said, lots of Democrats are hardly excited about Obama.
Though he doesn't foresee crippling division, Spencer sees two other serious problems for the Republicans from the way the campaign has been fought.
He thinks the candidates' use of the immigration issue blows away the fastest-growing segment of the electorate. In 1976, Hispanics cast 1 percent of the vote. In 2008, it was 9 percent, with Democrats winning by more than two to one. This year, the Hispanic voters could well exceed 10 percent of the electorate. While Obama's failure to achieve, or even try hard to win, new immigration legislation leaves Hispanic voters disappointed, he at least says the right things.
Republicans, Spencer said, have some natural advantages with Hispanic voters. "They are family-oriented. They are industrious people. They are small-business-community people. Their basic belief system is closer to being a Republican than it is a Democrat. So that gives you a prime target."
But when Republican candidates "start talking about 'shipping them back' and 'no amnesty' and all that, that's their cousin or their uncle. It's getting back to family again." The result is to send them to the Democrats.
This time, recent polls show Obama with a solid but not overwhelming lead among Hispanics. "They are not happy with him," said Spencer, "but they are going to vote for him."
He thinks the way the campaign has played out, as a competition for the most conservative voters, turns off another critical segment of the electorate, independent voters.
Spencer's own history has been devoid of ideology. He has worked for all kinds of Republicans. Before he served as Ford's strategist in 1976, he and Bill Roberts invented the role of "citizen politician" that won the governorship of California for Reagan in 1966 and 1970. Afterward, he worked closely with Reagan in his winning presidential campaigns of 1980 and 1984. He had other prominent clients who were more conservative than Reagan (Representative John Rousselot) and more liberal than Ford (Senator Tom Kuchel).
In all those campaigns, he reached out to voters in the middle. And while he thinks core Republicans will come home to the eventual nominee, he doubts that independents will if the campaign keeps its current tone. If the candidates were focusing on Obama's weaknesses on the economy and gas prices, he said, they would have plenty of live ammunition to fire.
Instead, he said, when they are not attacking one another, "They're talking about abortion and contraception, blah, blah, blah." Those issues, he said, drive independents away.

HEADLINE: Home Builder Stocks at Highest Point in 2 Years After 6-Month Rise

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
After a bullish report on housing at a late summer investment conference in Dallas, the officials at Federated Investors decided to sink a few million dollars into the shares of the home builder Lennar.
Philip J. Orlando, Federated's chief equities market strategist, was hoping for a return of 20 percent to 30 percent, confident in an improving jobs market and upticks in housing construction and sales data.
Like many other stocks in the home building industry, Lennar surged, nearly doubling in price. 
Home builder stocks are at their highest level in two years, with the Standard & Poor's index of 11 home builder stocks rising 80 percent since October, the most recent low for the industry.
Investors looking to ride the wave from the last six months, however, may be too late. Home builder shares typically increase before the spring and summer home-selling season. And while housing reports have shown some improvement in recent months, data this week has been mixed. A report on Wednesday showed that the sales of existing homes declined slightly in February, while median sales prices rose for the first time in more than a year.
''If you were looking for a home run kind of move, you needed to have bought when the stocks were significantly undervalued six months ago,'' Mr. Orlando said.
''But we are starting to see fundamental improvement,'' he said. ''So you may have a situation where instead of stocks falling, maybe they drift sideways. We are not looking for a collapse. We are just not looking for a move up.''
Federated and other investors are betting that in 2012, the housing market will emerge from its doldrums. Government and industry data on housing have generally shown improvement for several months, although that may vary regionally. Prices are still depressed, but sales and permits to start new construction have picked up, though they are not near their peaks of 2005.
On Monday, the National Association of Home Builders said that its housing market index, which measures the outlook for home builders, held steady at 28 in March from the same level in February, its highest level in five years. While still far below the 70s it reached in 2005 during the housing boom, the index has doubled in the last six months.
On Tuesday, economic data showed that builders requested 5.1 percent more permits in February but broke ground on fewer units. On Wednesday, a report from the National Association of Realtors said that sales of previously owned homes declined 0.9 percent in February from January but that they were still at their second-highest level in 21 months. The median sales price for an existing home rose 0.3 percent to $156,600 in February, compared with a year earlier.
Diane Swonk, the chief economist for Mesirow Financial, said in a research commentary that pent-up demand for housing was clearly rising but that problems obtaining mortgages were limiting a recovery and would push more potential buyers into renting.
''Over all, it shows the housing market is improving, but still it is depressed,'' said Patrick Newport, an economist with IHS Global Insight.
One of the biggest problems hanging over the market is the glut of foreclosed properties, which has pushed down prices of new and existing homes. For the home builders, the question is how much the backlog will damp demand for new homes. High unemployment and stricter lending standards are also limiting sales.
The recent rise in shares is ''one of the biggest moves in the last few years,'' said Joel Locker, a home builders analyst with FBN Securities. ''But it has always been a sentiment-driven sector, and fundamentals change at a turtle pace. You might have started to turn the battleship around, but it takes a while.''
Home builder shares lost half their value when the housing market crumbled in 2007 and dropped further during the financial crisis of 2008-9. All last week and through Wednesday, the S.& P. home builder index closed higher than 300 for the first time since March 2009, though it is still far from its peak of over 600 in early 2007. The gains have outperformed the stock market's overall broad measure, the S.& P. 500, which has risen 27 percent since the beginning of October.
The companies whose share prices are performing best this year tend to be those that in 2011 were viewed by investors as having excess debt or weaker profit margins and that now have the most to gain from an improved housing market, said Adam Rudiger, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. The underperforming companies, on the other hand, generally have stronger balance sheets, or higher levels of cash and less debt.
Hovnanian Enterprises's shares rose from $1.03 in early October to $2.83 on Wednesday. The home builder, which posted a loss of about $18 million in the first quarter, has slashed its work force, bought land for future housing development and reduced its debt.
The company reported increases in contracts in recent months and a good start to the spring season. But it is too soon to say whether the housing market is rebounding, said J. Larry Sorsby, the chief financial officer for Hovnanian, which is based in Red Bank, N.J.
''The jury is still out,'' Mr. Sorsby said. ''I don't think anyone can say for sure, but we remain cautiously optimistic.''

HEADLINE: More Men Trading Overalls for Nursing Scrubs

BYLINE: By TESS VIGELAND; Devin Maverick Robins contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Detroit
IN 2007, Kurt Edwards figured he would be stacking and racking 80-pound boxes of dog food and celery in the back of a grocery store for the rest of his working life. And he was fine with that.
But that June, after nine years on the job, layoff notices arrived on the warehouse floor at the Farmer Jack store in Detroit where he worked. His employer, Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, closed the Farmer Jack chain. Today he still does a lot of lifting, but of people, not boxes. Mr. Edwards joined the ranks of former warehouse, factory and autoworkers trading in their coveralls and job uncertainty for nurses' scrubs.
At 49, divorced with no children, he now tends to patients on the graveyard shift at Sheffield Manor Nursing and Rehab Center, a two-story, gray brick building in a ramshackle neighborhood on Detroit's west side. Interviewed last month, he says he is making about $70,000 annually, $20,000 more than he did at the warehouse.
The story of how he made the transition is one that men like him appear to be telling with increasing frequency, and the demand for their services is what is setting so many of them on similar paths. 
Hard figures are elusive, but the Michigan Department of Energy, Labor and Economic Growth estimates a shortage of 18,000 nurses in the state by 2015 -- and the labor force is adapting.
Oakland University in nearby Rochester, Mich., has established a program specifically to retrain autoworkers in nursing -- about 50 a year since 2009. And the College of Nursing at Wayne State University in Detroit is enrolling a wide range of people switching to health careers, including former manufacturing workers, said Barbara Redman, its dean. ''They bring age, experience and discipline,'' she said.
David Pomerville brings a few more years than Mr. Edwards. A 57-year-old nursing student, he spent most of his career as an automotive vibration engineer, including almost 10 years at General Motors. His pink slip arrived in April 2009.
At the time, Mr. Pomerville was earning almost $110,000 a year at the General Motors Milford Proving Ground in Milford Township, Mich.
But having watched another round of bloodletting at G.M. three years earlier, he had already decided on nursing as his Plan B. ''I thought, 'Well, I worked on cars for this long, now I'm going to work on people for a while,' '' he said.
A married father of two and grandfather of two, Mr. Pomerville had almost no money saved when he was laid off. But the federal Trade Readjustment Act, which aids workers who lose their jobs as a result of foreign competition, paid for nursing school tuition. His wife is a teacher, and he receives unemployment benefits. He hopes to graduate at the end of this year, and he expects his salary will be about half what he used to make.
Timothy Henk ultimately decided not to try to stick it out as long as Mr. Pomerville did. Mr. Henk, 32, worked for eight years at the Ford Sterling Axle Plant in Sterling Heights, Mich., installing drive shafts in the F-150 truck, and was making about $25 an hour by 2007. With overtime, he earned $70,000 a year.
But as he and his wife contemplated having children, he worried that income would not last. So in 2007, he took a buyout, which included $15,000 a year for four years to put toward education. Two friends in nursing -- both women -- had suggested he look into joining their profession. He researched the demand for nurses in Michigan and used the buyout money to pay his tuition at Wayne State.
The amount of schooling required to be a nurse depends on the level of nursing a student chooses to pursue. Mr. Henk went through Wayne State's four-year program to obtain a bachelor of science in nursing and then took a licensing exam to become a registered nurse, or R.N. Other levels of nursing include the C.N.A., or certified nurse's aide, which can require as little as eight weeks of training plus a certification exam, and L.P.N., or licensed practical nurse, which requires one or two years of schooling and a licensing exam.
All of that assumes acceptance in a nursing program. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing said more than 67,000 applicants were turned away in 2010 for lack of faculty or classroom space -- not a good sign with a national nursing shortage projected to be as high as 500,000 by 2025.
Mr. Henk now works in the critical care unit at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich. He makes about $50,000 annually for a 36-hour workweek, though Ford's health insurance was better.
The choice to make this switch was probably least likely for Mr. Edwards, the former grocery worker. He dropped out of college and spent four years in the Army as a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division. He found his unionized warehouse job after a stint working for his father, an accountant.
''You have this plan, this goal,'' he said. ''I was going to be at this warehouse; all the guys were retiring with great benefits. I was part of the middle class, and I was going to make it.''
When it became clear that he would not make it to retirement there, someone he was dating suggested nursing.
Though he wrote it off as woman's work at first, he realized he was getting a bit old for manual labor. So he returned to school, living on unemployment checks and occasional groceries from by his mother. He spent the last four months of his L.P.N. training with no electricity because he could not afford to pay any bills except rent.
Once he finished, the Sheffield Manor administrator, LaKeshia Bell, pretty much hired him on the spot. ''They are like a hot commodity,'' she said. ''A male presence actually helps us in the facility.'' At 5 feet 9 inches tall and 220 pounds, Mr. Edwards lifts patients as easily as he stacked boxes.
But he still appears to be a rarity. Just 7 percent of employed registered nurses are men, according to a 2008 Department of Health and Human Services survey. It did not count licensed practical nurses. Still, the percentage of people certified in nursing in some way who are men has risen to 9.6 percent since 2000 from 6.2 percent before, according to the department.
Ms. Bell noted that new nurses coming from manufacturing had unusual adjustments to make. When dealing with parts on the factory floor, she said, repetition is a major part of the job. ''These are not parts. They're people, so you can't just have a set regimen like in a plant setting,'' she said.
That cultural shift goes both ways. Mr. Edwards's supervisor, Yvonne Gipson, provided an example. ''I mean Kurt is not an ugly man, O.K.?'' she said. ''You got all these female workers, and they're all looking at him like, 'Oh! Potential husband!' So, yes, it does change.'' Her voice trailed off, erupting into peals of laughter as Mr. Edwards slipped a $20 bill into her pocket.
While these success stories point to opportunity, Michigan's unemployment rate is still 9 percent. And Nelson Lichtenstein, director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor and Democracy at the University of California, Santa Barbara, says history is a cruel taskmaster when it comes to struggling industries.
''When one industry goes in decline and another comes to the fore, you don't have a one-to-one employment replacement at all,'' he said. ''It takes a decade, two decades. In the meantime, some people find their careers are ended, ruined, and they never get them back.''
For these new nurses, the advantage is the demand in Michigan. Mr. Edwards knows he is lucky. ''You know I wake up every day and I'm very proud,'' he said. ''I'm looking in the mirror. I'm happy. I'm proud. I'm saying, you know, this turned out great. The lights are on!''

HEADLINE: To Cut Costs, Postal Service Turns to Rural Stores

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Postal Service, which has proposed closing 3,700 offices, is setting up services inside small grocery stores as it tries to maintain service while trimming billions of dollars in costs.
The agency has been losing $35.7 million a day, and 85 percent of its 32,000 offices do not make enough to cover their expenses. So it is hoping that working with retailers to put stamps and a modicum of mailing services alongside beer and lottery tickets will help put a dent in its growing deficit.
The Postal Service has long allowed retailers to sell postage. But now it is arranging to provide some basic mailing services in stores in rural areas like Brant, Mich., a town of just over 2,000 about 30 miles southwest of Saginaw. 
The post office there closed last year because it did not have a postmaster and another post office was nearby.
Last October, the Postal Service contracted out services to Nixon's Grocery, a store known primarily for its produce and fresh meats. Although it does not provide the full range of mailing services, residents can mail letters, buy stamps and send packages. There are also 20 post office boxes for rent.
The store's owner, Gary Nixon, said he received about $500 a year from the Postal Service for the setup.
''We didn't do it for the money,'' Mr. Nixon said. ''It's a service for our customers. People really appreciate it.''
There are currently 10 stores across the country serving as village post offices. Two more are expected to open this week, and an additional 26 are under contract but waiting for equipment. The Postal Service said it had gotten more than 600 inquires from other communities that are interested.
The village post office is one of the many ways the Postal Service is seeking to cut cost as revenue declines. The agency said it could not tell how much it would save by setting up shop in small groceries and hardware stores, but it did say it expects to save $200 million annually by closing branches.
The agency is also looking to offer products in other places where customers are already shopping, like drugstores and retail chains, and to expand its services at office supply stores.
Sue Brennan, a spokeswoman for the Postal Service, calls the arrangements with stores a win-win for local communities and the service.
''We want to have a presence in these communities, but we simply can't continue to do what we are doing,'' Ms. Brennan said. ''These village post offices saves us money and still provides needed services in the communities.
Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, said the Postal Service should consider using major retailers like Walmart.
''It works for banks and pharmacies,'' Mr. Carper said. ''There is no reason why you couldn't have a post office branch in a Walmart store. They are located all across rural America.''
The Postal Service said it was considering several options.
Congress plans to begin work on several postal bills in the next few weeks that are aimed at restructuring the Postal Service's finances.
The volume of mail has plummeted with the rise of e-mail, online coupons and electronic bill-paying. Volume is down 25 percent from five years ago, and projections show even further declines, said Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe.
But federal law prevents the Postal Service from raising postage rates faster than inflation.
Meanwhile, the agency has had a tough time cutting costs to match the revenue drop, with a history of labor contracts offering generous health and pension benefits and no layoff provisions, and laws that restrict its ability to cut the frequency of deliveries.
Postal Service officials say that a major factor behind the agency's $20 billion in losses over the last four years is a 2006 law requiring it to pay an average of $5.5 billion annually for 10 years to finance retiree health costs for the next 75 years. One bill pending in Congress, co-sponsored by Mr. Carper, would lower the payment and stretch it out over a 40-year period.
Postal Service officials say village post offices in grocery stores and other locations will not save the agency, but will help reduce costs while maintaining services.
''Any savings we can get helps us move toward financial stability,'' Ms. Brennan said.

HEADLINE: Lender With an Unusual Offer: A Second Chance

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
BROCKTON, Mass.
THREE years ago, after the government moved in to save big banks from failure, many homeowners facing foreclosure started asking, ''Where's our bailout?''
Annmarie Zaparesky got hers.
Through an unorthodox program in Massachusetts, Ms. Zaparesky was able to save her home, a white raised ranch in a neighborhood of wide streets, large yards and modest houses in this blue-collar city near Boston. At a time when roughly 20 percent of homeowners owe more than their homes are worth, an innovative program lowered Ms. Zaparesky's payments and reduced her total debt to something closer to the house's actual value.
The program, run by a nonprofit investment corporation called Boston Community Capital, is helping to bring homeowner debt in line with reality, something many lenders have been reluctant to do even as foreclosures continue to drive down housing prices. Boston Community buys houses out of foreclosure, sells them back to the families that lost them and gives them a new, more affordable mortgage.
Ms. Zaparesky and her husband, Bradford, bought the house -- their first -- in 1995 for $90,000 and moved in with their three children. But a few years later, Mr. Zaparesky learned that he had cancer. The doctors gave him three to five years to live. 
Mr. Zaparesky was a claims manager for an insurance company, and Ms. Zaparesky had quit her job as a paralegal and begun working as a manager at a Save-A-Lot grocery store (she now manages two stores). Mr. Zaparesky had always handled the couple's finances. ''He was the one with the big paycheck,'' she said.
In 2002, when property values were rising, he refinanced the house. Ms. Zaparesky said she was unhappy when she learned that he had gotten an adjustable rate loan that lacked even a short fixed-interest rate at the beginning. But she did not protest. ''He was dying,'' she said.
Mr. Zaparesky outlived the doctors' predictions. But in 2008, when their daughter Danielle got married, he was too sick to attend the wedding. He died a week later.
Almost immediately, Ms. Zaparesky, now 53, fell behind on her payments. Although her children were grown, she shared the house with her elderly father. Unused to dealing with bills, Ms. Zaparesky has only a foggy grasp of what happened next.
In an interview last month, she said she believed that she had been offered a loan modification under what she called ''Obamacare,'' but the offer from her mortgage servicer, American Home Mortgage Servicing, came before President Obama took office. It allowed her to make interest-only payments for five years.
The payments were to be around $1,100 a month. But even that was too much to handle for Ms. Zaparesky, who was juggling financial responsibilities on her own for the first time.
''My world came crashing down,'' she said.
Ms. Zaparesky and her mortgage servicer disagree about subsequent events. She tried several times to apply for a permanent loan modification, she said, a process she described as ''a farce.'' She repeatedly faxed and mailed in papers, she said, that she was then told had been lost -- a common story among struggling homeowners.
American Home Mortgage Servicing, though, prides itself on its ability to work with delinquent borrowers. The company, which will soon change its name to Homeward Residential, said it tried to give her another modification but did not receive the required paperwork. According to the company's records, Ms. Zaparesky did not qualify for the federal Home Affordable Modification Program because the house was not her primary residence. She said she never moved out of the house.
At any rate, the foreclosure process began in August of last year. At that point, she owed about $200,000.
''They just kept saying nope, nope, nope,'' Ms. Zaparesky said. ''All they cared about was, Let's foreclose on the house. You'd think they would work with me instead of having another house foreclose.''
Despair was close at hand.
''I did wake up one morning and said, 'That's it: I'm not going to fight anymore,' '' Ms. Zaparesky said. ''I was on a roller coaster.''
At about that point, she heard about Boston Community Capital from a local mortgage counselor. The group has tried to prevent evictions and vacancies through an initiative it calls SUN, or Stabilizing Urban Neighborhoods.
The concept is predicated on the fact that homes in foreclosure usually sell at distressed prices, which are even lower than the home's already depressed fair market value. When homeowners default, Boston Community offers to buy their homes, either from the bank or from the owners in a short sale approved by the bank. If the bank consents, Boston Community buys the homes at the distressed value and sells them back to the homeowners at something closer to market value, which is usually substantially less than they had owed.
To qualify for the program, the homeowner must have experienced hardship, like job loss or illness, and must demonstrate the ability to make the new payment. In Ms. Zaparesky's case, her boyfriend, who is now living in the house, signed on to help. The homeowner also makes a $5,000 down payment. If the house is later sold at a profit, Boston Community is entitled to half the proceeds.
The program is two years old and has just begun to near its goal of roughly 10 mortgages a month.
Before Ms. Zaparesky's house could go on the auction block, Boston Community bought it for $128,000 in a short sale, which is where the lender or servicer agrees to accept less than is owed on the home. Boston Community then sold it back to Ms. Zaparesky for $168,000 -- more than the estimated market value, but $32,000 less than she owed. Her payment decreased by $300.
Although Ms. Zaparesky's recent payment history would have disqualified her from getting a loan at most banks, a network of private investors and foundations enabled Boston Community to give her a loan with an interest rate of 6.25 percent.
In this particular transaction, every party seems to have come away happy. Boston Community puts its $40,000 markup in a loan loss reserve to protect investors. (So far, only one homeowner has defaulted.)
American Home Mortgage, by its calculations, saved the investors who owned the loan a lot of money -- 99.3 percent of its fair market value, according to Philippa Brown, a spokeswoman for the servicer, compared with the 78.7 percent it estimated it was likely to get in a foreclosure sale.
Ms. Zaparesky and her father get to stay in the home. And there is one less foreclosure weighing down property values in the neighborhood.
But not every transaction is as smooth. Many banks refuse to participate in the program.
Bank of America and several smaller banks, as well as some servicers, will allow Boston Community to sell a home back to the original owner, but in many cases HSBC, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo will not. One of the country's two giant mortgage guarantors, Fannie Mae, cooperates with Boston Community, but the other, Freddie Mac, does not.
Some lenders refuse because they believe they can get more money for the property; others simply will not allow short sales to be transferred back to the original owner, saying they are trying to prevent fraud. Still others fear that the program will encourage other homeowners to default.
In a similar program that is still in its infancy, a consortium of housing groups led by Mercy Housing Inc., based in Denver, has arranged to buy loans, instead of houses, and write them down. It thus avoids having to negotiate with unwilling banks.
For her part, Ms. Zaparesky said the Boston Community program relieved her of her biggest burden. Giving a brief tour of her house, she paused in the cozy kitchen, where on Sundays she makes an Italian pasta soup for her children and four grandchildren. Since she closed on the house in late January, the kitchen has gotten a fresh coat of paint.
''I felt like 100 pounds or more was lifted off my shoulders the day I walked out of there,'' Ms. Zaparesky said. ''Totally gone.''

HEADLINE: Why Panic? A Couple's Nest Egg Better Left Alone

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
IMAGINE for a moment that your fairy godmother had appeared on Jan. 1, 2000. She told you that, over the coming decade, there would be two recessions, high unemployment and a major financial crisis that reverberated around the globe.
With that guidance, would you have done anything differently with your retirement savings?
Many retirees or those close to retiring would have probably dumped their money into cash and then waited for the markets to stabilize. But would that have been the right decision?
This is a situation that Mark Gochnour, a vice president at the mutual fund managers Dimensional Fund Advisors, sketches out as part of a presentation he has made to nearly 1,000 financial professionals over the last year. And he makes a strong case that it would have paid to remain invested in a well-diversified portfolio -- and he uses his own retired parents as an example. 
After all, his parents, Bryce and Luanne Gochnour of Boise, Idaho, a former orthodontist and homemaker, have already endured two recessions -- including the Great One -- since Mr. Gochnour stopped working in 1997. Their portfolio's peaks and valleys are traced in the big chart at right, which their son likes to contrast with the more volatile course of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Their portfolio, which is evenly divided between stock and bond funds, has certainly had its share of rough patches, particularly during the market plunge in 2008 and 2009, which caused their savings to dwindle about 25 percent from the market peak. But it has come back since then, and things could have turned out much worse had they not followed their son's investment mantra: Focus on the things you can control.
''It is really the simple things that I call the blocking and tackling of investing,'' the younger Mr. Gochnour said. ''And you have to stay disciplined and stick with your plan, not only in good times but in more challenging times as well.''
You have heard this refrain before. It includes building a well-balanced portfolio, while keeping investment costs and taxes to a minimum. It also means giving up efforts to pick the next Apple or the next hotshot money manager and not trying to get out of the stock market before it crashes again. It also helps to turn off the television.
And that's precisely what his parents -- his father is 75, his mother is 72 -- have continued to do. Their portfolio is invested in a collection of 15 mutual funds from D.F.A., which are sold through a select group of financial advisers. (D.F.A.'s approach, a twist on index investing, also tends to include heavier helpings of smaller-cap and value stocks, based on research showing that they tend to outperform the broader market over time.) Taken together, the funds, which represent more than 11,000 securities from 44 countries, have fees that cost 0.30 percent of assets each year.
That does not include the annual fee the couple pays to their financial planner, which typically costs an additional 1 percent. But Mr. Gochnour is adamant that it is well worth the price because of the invaluable hand-holding you will need during your darkest hours of doubt.
With a nest egg of about $1 million, the Gochnours entered retirement with more money than the typical American retiree. But a smaller portfolio with an identical investment mix would have had the same track record. From January 1995 through February 2012, the portfolio has delivered an annualized return of 7.85 percent, before inflation, compared with the S.& P.'s 8.55 percent. (For clarity's sake, the chart does not reflect any withdrawals.)
In exchange for a less volatile ride that resulted from their not being 100 percent in stocks, the Gochnours had to give up nearly a percentage point of return, which seems like a worthwhile trade. ''A well-diversified portfolio is a much smoother experience,'' the younger Mr. Gochnour said.
And during the ''LostDecade,'' the nickname for the decade ending in 2010 that relates to the stock market's paltry returns during the period, the portfolio earned a respectable annualized return of 5.9 percent.
Anyone who doesn't have a financial planner or simply can't stomach paying for one could have achieved similar results over the same time period, with a smaller collection of funds that are accessible to all investors. A portfolio recommended by Vanguard that was also evenly split between stocks and bonds -- using only three index funds -- delivered an annualized return of 7.59 percent return over the 1995 to 2012 period. Meanwhile, a portfolio that comes as close as possible to replicating the Gochnours' investments using only Vanguard mutual funds had a return of 7.61 percent.
These results look good now, from the rearview mirror. But during the scarier moments, particularly as the market struggled to find a bottom in 2009, Mr. Gochnour's mother began to worry. So she called him one evening and told him they were thinking about selling their two-bedroom home in Palm Springs, which they bought after retirement and where they live for half the year. ''I asked her, 'What changed?' And she said, 'Well, I don't know if we can afford it anymore.' ''
After all, the stock market had lost about 50 percent of its value from its peak and she was under the impression that they, too, had lost half of their money. But her son pointed out that only half of their money was invested in stocks, with the other half safely sitting in high-quality bond funds.
In fact, they had enough money in those funds alone to cover 15 more years of their annual spending, which means they had at least that long to let their stock funds recover. He suggested that his parents call their adviser, which they did. And after running some numbers, they realized they were still on track to meet their goals.
The elder Gochnours' success is largely because of their disciplined savings habits. Even though they had enough money to live a comfortable lifestyle, they did not spend lavishly. Their one big expense was their large family home -- they paid $186,000 in 1975 -- which sat on five acres on the Boise River in Idaho. As Mark remembers it, family vacations were not spent at fancy hotels but at smaller hotels off the Interstate. ''And we'd always pack a cooler with milk, cereal and fruit and we'd lug it into the hotel,'' he said.
The couple, who moved to a Boise town house after selling their home, is also comfortable with the way their portfolio is invested. They have had their nervous moments, but they have not reached a point where they felt the need to sell any of their stocks at an inopportune time. Retirees who go on a selling spree as the stock market is plunging can do a lot of damage because they are essentially locking in their losses -- whether it's out of fear, or because they're too heavily invested in stocks and need the money to live on.
That's why investors need to think seriously about whether they can handle the volatility associated with their own portfolio. ''If you don't think you can stick with it, you need to rethink your plan,'' their son said. That might involve dialing down your stock exposure. ''And there is nothing wrong with that.''
Lowering your allocation to stocks may translate into a lower return, which means you may have to save some more, work a bit longer or make some other adjustments.
In fact, Mr. Gochnour had to work a few years more than he would have liked to make up for a real estate investment gone awry much earlier in his career.
''There is nothing wrong in doing some of those things, as long as you can afford your investment to go to zero,'' the younger Mr. Gochnour said. ''Just be sure you understand that's speculation, not investing.''
Trying to sell a bunch of stocks in 2009 or buy them in 2007 would have been speculation, too. But that kind of bet could have been even more damaging.

HEADLINE: One Couple's Ordeal Against Credit-Card And Housing Debt

BYLINE: By TESS VIGELAND; Devin Maverick Robins contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Seattle
TWELVE-STEP programs often talk about the moment of clarity, when an addict starts to understand just how dire the situation has become.
For Karawynn Long, 42, and Jak Koke, 47, it arrived in 2005, when they crossed the $40,000 mark on their credit card bills. ''For some reason that was a scary number, over some internal threshold,'' Ms. Long said.
Their pledge to fix the problem came a couple of years before the economy turned, giving them a head start on all the other people who buckled down once disaster become clear. Ms. Long and Mr. Koke, who live here, paid off the debt, earned more money and changed their spending habits -- all of the things you're supposed to do when plotting a financial turnaround.
But in the end, their best efforts were not enough to avoid being dragged down by the one asset that they thought would protect them -- their home, which they will have to shed before they can complete their comeback. 
Their story begins in early 2002, when they moved in together. A year later, they began a publishing start-up -- Per Aspera Press -- that they hoped would become their own science fiction and fantasy imprint. The business name is taken from the Latin phrase ''ad astra per aspera,'' which means ''to the stars through difficulties.'' But the effort generated more difficulties than stars, and they struggled to finance it with ever-more credit card debt.
Ms. Long, an author herself, also acknowledged that half of that $40,000-plus debt load was from living beyond their means.
She always assumed she would share the upper-middle-class lifestyle of her childhood. She went out to eat -- a lot -- something that continued during her relationship with Mr. Koke. They took vacations. And when money was tight? ''Basically I just put it on credit cards to keep that level of lifestyle no matter the actual situation,'' she said. ''Like I was entitled to that.''
Mr. Koke grew up in what he describes as an average middle-class family. Both his parents worked. His money philosophy has always been to try to arrange his expenses and his life so that he could live on part-time employment, with the rest of his time devoted to writing novels.
''I did pick up the responsibility gene in the sense that up until we had our business where we ran up this huge debt, I didn't have much debt on my cards,'' he said. And the pair were sure the publishing imprint would succeed. ''It always seemed like at some point it will break through and pay for itself and our lives, too,'' Mr. Koke said. ''But it never actually did.''
The credit cards had also seen them through periods of unemployment. Both have spent the bulk of their careers in the technology industry, mostly as contract employees. She has worked as a Web designer at various start-ups, and he has had jobs as a biotech researcher at several universities, as well as on-and-off work doing technical and marketing writing and editing at Microsoft.
He has two daughters from a previous marriage: Michaela, 19, who rents a room from a great-aunt in Portland, Ore., while saving for college, and Claire, 13, who lives half-time with her father and Ms. Long.
By late 2005, Ms. Long started to worry about the ballooning debt. Early in 2006 they began household austerity measures, including few or no meals in restaurants, no vacations and the suspension of contributions to their retirement funds.
The couple also shut down the publishing effort and found full-time jobs. She worked for a brokerage firm, and he got what he thought was a long-term contract writing for Microsoft. That raised their combined annual income to around $150,000.
Then, they threw every extra penny at the credit card debt, around $2,000 a month. Soon the older daughter, Michaela, noticed that the formerly automatic answer of ''Sure, honey, here's the money'' started to change. ''If you wanted to get a sports sweatshirt or something we would work something out where I paid half if I really wanted it,'' Michaela said.
Claire, who was 7 at the time, said she noted the drop-off in vacations and meals out. And Christmas changed. ''I did think I used to want to have lots of stuff under the tree,'' she said. ''But then I kind of got more excited about people opening the presents that I got them and making them happy. You don't need to have all the things.''
The couple first took aim at the credit cards with the highest interest rates and wiped out the entire balance within two years. To celebrate, they took vacations to Sea World and Mexico. But the family had mere months to enjoy the accomplishment before the nation spiraled into financial crisis.
By October 2008, Ms. Long was unemployed. Mr. Koke's hours at Microsoft were slashed in half, and his wages for the time he did work dropped by 10 percent. Both have lived off contract work in the three years since, and their annual income is less than half of its peak. What saved them from utter financial devastation was the fact that they had rid themselves of the credit card debt.
But then there was that one remaining troubled debt lurking: their home. The green, single-story house sits among fragrant pine trees in a quiet neighborhood of north Seattle, near Haller Lake. Inside, the furnishings are sparse and tend toward Native American arts and Pacific Northwest decor.
They bought it in 2006, just as their family austerity measures began. It measures 1,800 square feet and cost just over $400,000. They had not saved enough for a down payment, so they did what many Americans did at the time: they took out a second mortgage, also known as a piggyback loan. The first mortgage was a 30-year fixed rate loan for $303,750. The second mortgage was for $101,250 with a 15-year fixed rate and a balloon payment at the end. This meant they had no equity in the home from the outset. Based on estimates at Zillow.com, they now owe $82,000 more on the mortgage than the property is worth.
Given their severely diminished household income, the two mortgage payments ended up being about 65 percent of the couple's take-home pay each month. ''We were killing ourselves to pay this mortgage,'' Ms. Long said.
So in January 2011, they stopped paying.
They said they had tried to work with their bank, to no avail. So they are squatting in their own home, waiting for a foreclosure notice to tell them when they must leave. Ms. Long, who now writes her own personal finance blog called Pocketmint, was blunt. ''I'm C.F.O. of this household,'' she said. ''It's a business decision for us.''
The mortgage payments that have not gone to the bank have instead gone into an emergency fund and will also help with an eventual apartment rental.
The family also took a vacation last fall, their first in at least two years. The four of them flew to Washington, D.C., for less than $250 each, according to Ms. Long, who did dogged airfare research. They stayed with a relative, prepared most of their own meals (including lunches to eat outside the Smithsonian museums), and spent less than $1,800 for nine days, she said.
Those who would look askance at that expense when they are not paying the mortgage, Ms. Long said it was money well spent. ''We took a vacation to the Smithsonian because we've learned that experiences, rather than possessions, are the way to happiness,'' she said. ''And we wanted to share that with our kids.''
Claire says she learned even more over the last few years by watching her parents work their way through their financial problems. ''I learned,'' she said, ''a lot about not getting trapped.''

HEADLINE: The New Globalist Is Homesick

BYLINE: By SUSAN J. MATT. 
Susan J. Matt is a professor of history at Weber State University and the author of ''Homesickness: An American History.''

 BODY:
Ogden, Utah
ACCORDING to a recent Gallup World Poll, 1.1 billion people, or one-quarter of the earth's adults, want to move temporarily to another country in the hope of finding more profitable work. An additional 630 million people would like to move abroad permanently.
The global desire to leave home arises from poverty and necessity, but it also grows out of a conviction that such mobility is possible. People who embrace this cosmopolitan outlook assume that individuals can and should be at home anywhere in the world, that they need not be tied to any particular place. This outlook was once a strange and threatening product of the Enlightenment but is now accepted as central to a globalized economy. 
It leads to opportunity and profits, but it also has high psychological costs. In nearly a decade's research into the emotions and experiences of immigrants and migrants, I've discovered that many people who leave home in search of better prospects end up feeling displaced and depressed. Few speak openly of the substantial pain of leaving home.
This emotional style became common among mobile Americans in the 20th century, but represented a departure from the past. In the 19th century, Americans of all stripes -- pioneers, prospectors, soldiers and the millions of immigrants who streamed into the nation -- admitted that mobility was emotionally taxing. Medical journals explored the condition, often referring to it by its clinical name: nostalgia.
Stories of the devastating effects of homesickness were common. In 1887, an article in the Evening Bulletin of San Francisco had the headline, ''Victim of Nostalgia: A Priest Dies Craving for a Sight of his Motherland'' and reported that the Rev. J. M. McHale, a native of Ireland, had fallen ill with nostalgia after arriving in Brooklyn. Shortly before he died, he declared: ''I am homesick. My dear country, I will never set a foot on your green shores again. Oh, my mother, how I long to see you.''
Today, explicit discussions of homesickness are rare, for the emotion is typically regarded as an embarrassing impediment to individual progress and prosperity. This silence makes mobility appear deceptively easy.
Technology also seduces us into thinking that migration is painless. Ads from Skype suggest that ''free video calling makes it easy to be together, even when you're not.'' The comforting illusion of connection offered by technology makes moving seem less consequential, since one is always just a mouse click or a phone call away.
If they could truly vanquish homesickness and make us citizens of the world, Skype, Facebook, cellphones and e-mail would have cured a pain that has been around since ''The Odyssey.''
More than a century ago, the technology of the day was seen as the solution to the problem. In 1898, American commentators claimed that serious cases of homesickness had ''grown less common in these days of quick communication, of rapid transmission of news and of a widespread knowledge of geography.''
But such pronouncements were overly optimistic, for homesickness continued to plague many who migrated.
Today's technologies have also failed to defeat homesickness even though studies by the Carnegie Corporation of New York show that immigrants are in closer touch with their families than before. In 2002, only 28 percent of immigrants called home at least once a week; in 2009, 66 percent did. Yet this level of contact is not enough to conquer the melancholy that frequently accompanies migration. A 2011 study published in the Archives of General Psychiatry found that Mexican immigrants in the United States had rates of depression and anxiety 40 percent higher than nonmigrant relatives remaining in Mexico. A wealth of studies have documented that other newcomers to America also suffer from high rates of depression and ''acculturative stress.''
Ricardo Valencia, an immigrant from Guadalajara, puts a face to such statistics. In 2005, he traveled to Nevada to work so he could pay off a mortgage on his house. The day after he arrived in Nevada, he thought, I want to leave! As he explained to me: ''I've always been really close with my family. ... I had to stand it, we had to stand it ... but returning was always in mind.'' He used e-mail and phone cards to keep in touch with his wife, calling her several times a week. But even this regular communication could not assuage his tremendous homesickness. He finally returned to his family in 2009.
Like Mr. Valencia, 20 to 40 percent of all immigrants to the United States ultimately return to their native lands. They know that Skype is no substitute for actually being there.
It is possible that these new technologies actually heighten feelings of displacement. Maria Elena Rivera, a psychologist in Tepic, Mexico, believes technology may magnify homesickness. Her sister, Carmen, had been living in San Diego for 25 years. With the rise of inexpensive long-distance calling, Carmen was able to phone home with greater frequency. Every Sunday she called Mexico and talked with her family, who routinely gathered for a large meal. Carmen always asked what the family was eating, who was there. Technology increased her contact with her family but also brought a regular reminder that she was not there with them.
The immediacy that phone calls and the Internet provide means that those away from home can know exactly what they are missing and when it is happening. They give the illusion that one can be in two places at once but also highlight the impossibility of that proposition.
The persistence of homesickness points to the limitations of the cosmopolitan philosophy that undergirds so much of our market and society. The idea that we can and should feel at home anyplace on the globe is based on a worldview that celebrates the solitary, mobile individual and envisions men and women as easily separated from family, from home and from the past. But this vision doesn't square with our emotions, for our ties to home, although often underestimated, are strong and enduring.

HEADLINE: A Struggle at Work and Home When Country Calls

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
SAN DIEGO
IN early 2008, Patrick Berry, then 41, decided it was time to start his own firm. He was a financial adviser at Smith Barney, but he wanted to focus on his area of expertise, advising companies on their on 401(k) plans while offering wealth management services to executives in those companies.
He had built his book of business back up after being recalled to active duty as a member of the Navy SEALs from 2002 to 2004, and he felt confident that he could give his clients better service if he was independent.
As he was planning to leave, Mr. Berry heard a rumor that he would be recalled for a second time. There were supposed to be six years between recalls, but the length of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan caused that rule to change. 
Mr. Berry, now a lieutenant, still has the broad shoulders, barrel chest and square jaw of the ''door kicker'' he was as an elite member of the SEALs in his 20s. He said he could have retired from the service and skirted his recall, but he said that would not have been the ethical thing to do. He also could have stayed at Smith Barney.
''I knew that if I left after I returned, the manager was going to be pretty bitter, and he would have a right to be,'' he said last month, sitting on the deck of the Midway, a decommissioned aircraft carrier and museum docked in San Diego Bay. ''I decided I'd hire someone to run my business while I was recalled, and I wouldn't have to worry that one of these other guys would get my clients.''
''I thought, 'I can make this work,' '' he added.
While Mr. Berry was planning his move, the financial markets began to collapse in what would become the worst recession since the Great Depression.
There was one other variable. Mr. Berry had a family, a wife who worked full-time and three daughters.
So Mr. Berry's life was about to enter a period of high-pressure demands. For him, this time would pit two things he loved -- the SEALs and his family -- against each other with additional pressure from clients who were going through extreme financial distress themselves.
By the time he finally moved his clients to his own firm in April 2009, his plan was already under strain, with the stock market just above its lowest point (but with no way for anyone to know that). Two months later, when his recall became official, he reported to the Naval Amphibious Base in Coronado, Calif.
The Navy assigned him to a project, with a reservist on leave from Accenture, to reorganize the SEALs reserve force. Mr. Berry began every morning with a run on the beach where he had gone through training two decades earlier. Then he spent the next 12 hours applying his skills as a financial adviser to the SEALs members: he cold-called former members with needed skills and tried to persuade them to come back. With so many members deployed in combat, the force needed support staff in the United States who knew how it operated.
''When you're kicking down doors, slinging lead downrange, capturing bad guys -- you think that is it,'' Mr. Berry said. ''We do that very well. We're challenged in some other areas.''
At the same time, Mr. Berry hired an assistant to help him stay in contact with his financial clients before and after his Navy days. Sleeping four hours a night, he had little time left for his wife of eight years and daughters, who were 5, 3 and 1.
''I felt I was under an incredible amount of pressure,'' he said. ''At the same time, what I'm hearing from the Navy is if you get divorced we're sorry to hear that, but we're going to win this war and if you're alive and divorced that's better than being dead on the battlefield.''
This is where he fell back on his training and made priorities: the SEAL team came first, then his clients and finally his family. ''Everyone wants to be a SEAL on a sunny day,'' he said. ''In the cold and without sleep, can you maintain your motivation under stress?''
In the last decade, 288,981 reservists throughout the armed services have been recalled to active duty, according to the Defense Manpower Data Center. J.J. Montanaro, a certified financial planner at USAA in San Antonio and a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve, said Mr. Berry's story is eerily familiar.
In November 2004, Mr. Montanaro, a West Point graduate, was recalled to active duty and given three weeks to prepare before being deployed to Afghanistan.
While he had a supportive employer -- USAA provides insurance and financial services to military members, retirees and their families -- he said he had not considered the toll that being recalled would take on his family. It was a problem he noticed as soon as he returned home.
''My mind-set was, things were where they were in December 2004, when I went and did my thing,'' Mr. Montanaro said. ''But when I came back, the train had continued to move, and I wasn't on it. I couldn't even see it anymore.''
While he and his wife were able to work through things, he said, many reservists were not so lucky. Few recognize how jarring it is to be plucked from a desk job into active duty and then sent back, and it is particularly difficult on a reservist's family, which often lacks the support network that exists on a military base.
It's crucial, he added, for men and women returning from active duty not to try to make up for lost time. ''I say this primarily on some of the things I've seen financially,'' Mr. Montanaro said. ''Folks come back and the kids want all these things. Our reaction is, 'Let me make it better by buying them what they want.' Don't overreach.''
Mr. Berry said he thought he had learned a lot from his first recall, but the added complexity of the financial crisis and his two additional children since then proved him wrong. His latest recall might have actually been more stressful because his office was just 30 minutes from the base, allowing him to think he could keep everything going.
''One of the casualties of all this was my marriage,'' said Mr. Berry, who is now facing a divorce. ''In hindsight, I should have stayed at Smith Barney and then made the move when I returned.''
But in line with a motto of the SEALs -- ''The only easy day was yesterday'' -- Mr. Berry has focused on moving forward with his business and life since returning from active duty in late 2010.
The one bright spot would seem to be his business, Concert Retirement Plan Consulting. He and his assistant were able to maintain it while Mr. Berry was away, and in the last year, he said, he had increased revenue by 40 percent. He says he believes he can continue to increase it, and hopes to hire another person soon.
Of course, not all comebacks are about money. Now 45, Mr. Berry said he had been able to carve out more time for his daughters and be the father his wife wanted him to be. He holds out hope that he can salvage his marriage, even though the divorce is proceeding.
But it is commitment to the Navy SEALs, one built as much on camaraderie as service to the country, that may be the hardest part of his juggling act. ''You have this identity, and mine is I'm a Navy SEAL,'' he said. ''That's hard to walk away from.''

HEADLINE: No Livelihood, but One Lively Soundtrack

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
You know those thoughts that wake you up at 3:35 in the morning? The ones that so many Americans are having now, in this age of high unemployment and rising prices, about the bottom falling out of their safe little worlds.
Well, try to imagine those sharp-toothed worries nattering away to the wail of a saxophone and the downbeat of a bass. Throw in some sliding guitar licks too. Now conjure up a general feeling of the kind of dark, secluded club where a worried man needs to be, instead of in his bed, at 3:35 a.m. 
Feel better? Thought you would.
That, more or less, is Ethan Lipton's recipe for dealing with the fantasies and reality of joblessness in ''No Place to Go,'' his immensely appealing new show at Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, which commissioned this piece. A composer, playwright and singer -- who has usually gotten his most crucial paycheck from part-time work in publishing -- Mr. Lipton recreates the anxieties and epiphanies that besiege him when he learns his longtime employer is moving out of town (to Mars, to be exact).
O.K., scratch the epiphanies part. Mr. Lipton doesn't even see dim light bulbs switching on, never mind all-illuminating starbursts, as he gropes in song and patter through the darkness of a suddenly unanchored existence. But in the shadows he makes sweet (and occasionally sour) sounds that evoke a whole, highly personalized history of America singing through its troubles. He may not have a job, but, hey, he's got rhythm.
Directed by Leigh Silverman (''Well,'' ''Chinglish''), ''No Place to Go'' is a cracker-barrel-meets-speakeasy-style chronicle of the last weeks of its hero's 10-year ''permanent part-time'' job. He has been working as ''an information refiner'' in New York City, to which he refers folksily as ''our town.'' And most of what he describes -- the camaraderie in the workplace, the Orwellian language of ''corporate resources,'' the company soccer team -- is familiar to the point of banality.
But like many fine writers of fiction Mr. Lipton has the gift of seeing the everyday at just enough of a slant to slide flat prose into prickly poetry. He is a man who has willed himself into a mongrel showbiz alter ego -- part lounge crooner, part folk balladeer -- to connect with and heighten his own worldly (and often universal) woes.
Wearing a suit, tie and patterned shirt, all in shades of brown, Mr. Lipton is the essence of suave nerd, with a Weavers-esque populist streak. With his scrub-brush mustache and eyebrows that seem to be reaching hopefully to connect with each other, he brings to mind some of the goofier big-band leaders of the 1930s and '40s, guys whose faces always looked surprised to be on top of tuxedos.
Mr. Lipton, for the record, has his own big band, or self-described orchestra. It deserves to be called big, even though it consists of only three (delightful) musicians: Vito Dieterle (saxophone), Eben Levy (guitar) and Ian M. Riggs (bass). Although they are credited as co-writers of the songs, Mr. Lipton does not always acknowledge their existence, or not as much as they seem to feel he should.
But that's part of obsessively worrying about your own livelihood, isn't it? You become so blindly egocentric. Mr. Lipton weaves that selfishness into his very performance style. He is expert at keeping music, jokes and personal narrative tightly knitted together into one consistent human package.
Even though his vocalizing covers a wide vocabulary -- from Louis Armstrong and Billie Holiday to Pete Seeger and George Jones -- Mr. Lipton never seems to be doing impersonations or pretending to be anyone other than himself. This is equally true when he becomes a burned-out torch singer to lament the job that done him wrong, or assumes a demonic rasp to incarnate a lonely sandwich (turkey and Swiss) left behind on an office conference table.
Average Joes and Jills are encouraged these days to imagine themselves in musical fantasies, in which life naturally bursts into song. That was the premise behind Dennis Potter's great television works of several decades ago, ''Pennies From Heaven'' and ''The Singing Detective,'' and it's the appeal of ''Glee'' and those YouTube videos of spotty shut-ins making like divas in their bedrooms.
Mr. Lipton translates that sensibility into his own disarming and deceptively seamless style. (There are a lot of complicated components within it.) This is a show for anyone who has stayed up nights worrying that life might go into freefall, and for those of you who walk through your waking hours to the sound of an imaginary soundtrack, even without earbuds. No wonder the program for ''No Place to Go'' dedicates the show to ''the 100 percent.''

HEADLINE: Maker Pulls Pesticide Amid Fear Of Toxicity

BYLINE: By MALIA WOLLAN

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- A manufacturer has pulled a controversial pesticide from the American market, surprising both growers and environmentalists who have warned that it poses serious hazards.
The soil fumigant, known as methyl iodide and sold under the label Midas, will be withdrawn immediately as a result of a review of the product's ''economic viability in the U.S. marketplace,'' the Tokyo-based company, the Arysta LifeScience Corporation said in a statement late Tuesday. 
In the five years methyl iodide has been on the market, it has seen relatively little use. Farmers have injected the pesticide into only 17,000 acres -- mostly planted with tomatoes, peppers and nuts -- mainly in the southeastern United States.
Although federal environmental regulators approved the pesticide in 2007, methyl iodide became a focus of fierce debate in California before it gained final approval from state regulators there in December 2010.
In hearings on the chemical, intended for use on the state's lucrative strawberry crop, scientists and environmental activists raised concerns about its neurotoxicity and its potential to cause cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. One member of the department's own scientific review committee called it ''one of the most toxic chemicals on earth.''
Still, the company's sudden removal of the product was unanticipated. ''We were totally surprised by this,'' said Carolyn O'Donnell, a spokeswoman for the California Strawberry Commission, a growers' organization. The state's farmers grow 88 percent of the nation's strawberries, worth some $2.3 billion a year.
While the loss of methyl iodide means ''one less tool in the toolbox'' for strawberry farmers, Ms. O'Donnell said the industry was working with state regulators on a research effort to reduce the need for fumigant pesticides in strawberry fields.
Only one strawberry farmer in California used methyl iodide in 2011.
Environmental and labor organizations welcomed the company's decision.
''This is a tremendous victory for scientific integrity in the face of corporate pressure, especially for rural communities and farmworkers,'' said Paul Towers, a spokesman for Pesticide Action Network, a nonprofit environmental group.
The organization was one of 17 that sued Arysta LifeScience and state regulators in Alameda County Superior Court in early 2011, charging that it had failed to properly review the pesticide before approval. While a ruling was expected soon, it is unclear how the company's decision to remove the chemical from the market will affect the case.
Methyl iodide was developed to replace methyl bromide, a widely used soil fumigant banned under an international climate treaty after it was found to deplete ozone.
Arysta LifeScience said it would keep Midas registered with the federal Environmental Protection Agency, allowing for a possible reintroduction to the United States market in the future. The chemical is also registered in seven other countries, including Mexico and New Zealand. Japan is the only other country actively using it to fumigate soil.

HEADLINE: Myanmar Invites Americans and Europeans to Monitor Vote

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER

 BODY:
The United States said on Wednesday that it was ''encouraged'' that Myanmar had invited American and European representatives to monitor elections on April 1, a milestone for Myanmar as it emerges from decades of military dictatorship. 
The invitation is the latest in a series of steps taken by Myanmar's president, U Thein Sein, to pry open the country to the outside world and move toward democracy. Earlier this month, Mr. Thein Sein said that the country was seeking international recognition through ''continuous efforts to win further trust.''
Voting in recent years has been witnessed by a handful of foreign diplomats, including a delegation from North Korea, but the announcement on Wednesday was the first time in recent memory that Western countries were invited as observers. At stake for Myanmar is the possible lifting of sanctions. United States officials have said the handling of the elections will help determine whether Washington will rescind a raft of punitive economic measures.
On Tuesday, the head office of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is a member, announced that observers from each of the nine other Asean countries had been invited to witness the elections.
Adrienne Nutzman, a spokeswoman for the United States Mission in Myanmar, said by e-mail that Washington was encouraged by the invitation but ''concerned by reports of irregularities, local intimidation and a recent attack'' on opposition supporters.
''The Burmese authorities should take the necessary steps to ensure that the election process is free and fair, and to ensure that all political parties understand there is no place for violent attacks and intimidation,'' she said.
The United States did not immediately respond to the invitation.
The election is a watershed for Myanmar because it signals the beginnings of the political reconciliation of the military-backed establishment and the long-suppressed democracy movement. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the opposition, who was kept under house arrest for the better part of two decades, is running for Parliament.
The last time her party, the National League for Democracy, participated in elections was more than two decades ago, and the result was canceled by a military junta.
Significantly, however, the elections do not threaten the ruling party's hold on power. Only 48 seats out of more than 600 are being contested. The next general election is not scheduled until late in 2015.
But analysts say that the military establishment is turning out to be less monolithic than often perceived. ''On many key issues in Parliament, people aren't necessarily voting along party lines,'' said Thant Myint-U, a historian and former United Nations official who is one of the leading experts on the country. ''Party organizations are still relatively weak, and few have clear-cut ideologies or detailed policy positions.''
A recent bill in Parliament dealing with land rights was passed by one house but rejected by the other -- although both are controlled by the Union Solidarity and Development Party.
Mr. Thein Sein, a former general who was elected president last March, has led the changes in Myanmar, including the release of hundreds of political prisoners, peace overtures to minority ethnic groups and reconciliation with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi.

HEADLINE: Though Pace Is Picking Up, a Builder's Pay Is Not

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
BETHEL, Conn.
IN 2007, during his best year ever as a general contractor, Peter Schneider decided to reward himself and paint his house.
Like anyone else, he and his wife picked out some colors they liked and then painted areas of their house to see which ones looked best. They agreed on Devonwood Taupe.
But as soon as they picked the color, the housing market -- and Mr. Schneider's construction business -- collapsed. As he scrambled to save his business, he forgot about painting his house. Then, as business slowed and he had more time on his hands, money became tighter, so he held off on buying the paint.
And these days he is busy doing so many small, lower-paying jobs that he has neither the time nor the extra money to paint his house. The one bit of good news is that, four years later, Mr. Schneider still likes the areas painted Devonwood Taupe the best. 
Mr. Schneider, who has worked in construction all of his life, used to think he was accustomed to the ups and downs of the industry. But he has seen his business go from $2.5 million in revenue in 2007 to a tenth of that last year. It was not his worst year -- that was 2008 when he did $117,000 in sales -- but it was a year that set another record: the most jobs done for the least amount of money.
While these revenue numbers may sound lofty, Mr. Schneider, 57, said his take-home pay was usually 10 percent of anything above $1 million in sales. So, in 2007, he made about $150,000. For the last four years, he has met his business expenses but taken no salary, relying on other resources instead.
Yet he says he believes that his future is still in construction. ''It will come back,'' he said last month. ''It's a question of how long it will take.''
Since 1985, the year after he built the home in Bethel where he and his wife, Susan, raised three children, Mr. Schneider has come to see himself and his fellow tradesmen as akin to small farmers: they might have a lean year, but they will stick it out and everything will be fine.
''The thing that is different about this time is it's four years of down,'' he said.
Bethel is a small town in northern Fairfield County, with none of the sizzle of the county's wealthier towns like Greenwich, nor the poverty of the state's largest city, Bridgeport.
In Bethel, there are a few second homes on a lake, but the rest of the homes are mostly straightforward, three or four bedrooms and small yards. This was Mr. Schneider's sweet spot, homes he called ''custom practicality.''
His earliest houses ranged from 2,800 to 3,300 square feet. In the 1990s and the early years of this century, his homes got a little bigger but mostly they were on nicer plots of land. He completed the last home he built from scratch in 2007, and it stands as a monument to the boom years -- a 4,400-square-foot white colonial high on a hill.
Despite his previous success, Mr. Schneider said he had no idea when he would start building homes again. So he is making do with small projects that he and his one employee can manage.
He has two jobs now. The first involves creating two showrooms out of a one-story brick building, his first piece of commercial work. The other involves remodeling two bathrooms in a Brookfield, Conn., home.
The data suggests that Mr. Schneider's industry and the state have more tough times ahead. Robert Denk, senior economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said the country as a whole was at 34 percent of normal home production. Connecticut is at 26 percent.
Data from the United States Census Bureau shows issuance of single-family building permits in the state is still bumping along the bottom. There were 2,130 last year compared with 9,222 in 2004.
Mr. Denk said that by the end of 2013, Connecticut's building level will be 60 percent of normal production, which will be close to the national average.
Other observers see no reason for optimism. ''When I testified in front of the House Financial Services Committee in 2009, I said the housing market would not recover until the third quarter of 2014,'' said David Kittle, a former chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association, who is now a senior director at IMARC, which investigates mortgage fraud. ''We have interest rates below 4 percent, yet volumes are down. I don't believe consumer confidence applies to home-buying.''
For his part, Mr. Schneider retains a remarkably upbeat view of life. ''Building houses isn't just about the money,'' he said. ''It's about doing what you're supposed to be doing in life.''
His Ford panel van attests to a certain Yankee frugality. The only extra it has is an AM/FM radio, and the windows are the type you crank up and down. It gets 13 miles to the gallon, better than the eight miles per gallon some of his colleagues get in their flashier pickup trucks. Still, he spends $500 to $700 a month on gas.
His wife drives a 1993 Toyota Previa with 245,000 miles on it. ''We used to drive it because we liked it,'' he said. ''But now we have no choice.''
At the moment, he's not even thinking about retirement. His biggest concern is making sure their last child, a high school senior, gets to college. He regrets that she, like her older sister, will have to borrow money. ''If my business was good, she wouldn't have had to do that,'' he said.
He has not been skiing in three years and rents out the family's time-share in Hilton Head, S.C. They have even cut out Sunday night pizza to save the $25. ''It's the same old story,'' he said. ''You look at all of these things you used to do. You cut back and we're getting by.''
His wife had been working 20 hours a week helping out in a hospital laboratory. But she lost her position in December when that hospital merged with another one and has been looking for another job since then.
One bright spot is the two, three-family homes they bought about a decade ago. While only one is worth more than they paid, neither has a mortgage and the rental income has helped. ''The goal was to get some cash to put our kids through college,'' he said. ''What we didn't count on is we'd need them to put bread and butter on the table.''
As he walked around his house, Mr. Schneider insisted that the downturn, while financially devastating, has not changed his core values.
''My faith in God has gotten me through,'' he said. ''Money comes and money goes. We're just pilgrims passing through.''
Then he pointed proudly to the last bit of work he did on his own house: solar panels that he installed just as the crash was happening.
''When I decided to do it, I was making no money,'' he said. ''It was a step of faith. But it has saved us $200 a month in heating costs.''
Those panels ought to be good for a $13,000 tax credit. Someday soon, he hopes to again be among the roughly 50 percent of the population that makes enough money to pay federal income tax.

HEADLINE: From Revolution to the Civil War to 2012: Santorum Sees His Moment

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON

 BODY:
In Gettysburg, Pa., on Tuesday night, Rick Santorum stood on the grounds where more lives were lost than in any other Civil War battle, and where Abraham Lincoln issued his stirring call for unity and democracy. Mr. Santorum, who had just lost the Republican primary in Illinois, called the presidential race the ''most important election since the election of 1860.''
Numbers like 1776 and 1860 increasingly pepper his speeches as he stresses the historical urgency of his candidacy. He speaks of his campaign as bearing a torch of freedom and honor first lighted by the signers of the Declaration of Independence. While his supporters need not risk life and fortune as John Hancock and his compatriots did, Mr. Santorum tells his audiences, they can fulfill their own duty by posting pictures with the candidate on Facebook. 
As he traveled around Illinois, Mr. Santorum cast himself as the defender of America's history.
President Obama's health care law is ''a threat to the very essence of who America is,'' Mr. Santorum said in Herrin, Ill., on Saturday. He contended that in Americans' fearful reaction to the threat during the debt ceiling debate that benefit payments could be cut off, the president ''saw the power of government control, he saw the power of dependency, and that's the power that he wants to have over every man and woman in this country.''
In making historical allusions, Mr. Santorum has good company in the Republican field. Newt Gingrich has portrayed himself as a transformative figure, but he often takes a more internationalist bent by likening himself to leaders like Charles de Gaulle. Mr. Santorum often keeps it closer to home, although he has for years been throwing in references to Churchill and his confronting the Nazis, drawing a parallel with how he would deal with Iran.
Mr. Santorum regularly looks to the Declaration of Independence, which he says affirms an equality endowed by God, not government. His call to action, as issued to supporters in a gymnasium in Herrin, comes from the declaration's final line.
''It says, 'We mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor,' '' he said. People need not put their lives on the line, he added, nor their fortunes (though they can donate at RickSantorum.com, he is always sure to add, to laughter and applause). But ''your honor is on the line,'' he said.
He continued, speaking of a torch of freedom passed from the founders through each generation, ''If we are not successful in this election, I fear that we will be the generation that allows the torch to go out.''
But his supporters can forestall that, he said, ''if you walk out of here and not just vote for me, but you actually do the duty of freedom: actually work hard, call your friends, post this up on Facebook, tweet about it, write about it, e-mail it, talk to the folks at church, at the grocery store, at work, and turn out a huge vote.''
Mr. Santorum contrasts his view of America's history with Mr. Obama's, saying in a speech in Mount Vernon, Ill., that the president views the United States as ''a country that was always unjust, and we had problems that had yet to be fixed because government hadn't fixed them.''
He continued, ''Let me tell you something: America was founded to be great, from its very foundation.''
But his long view of history might already be proving shortsighted. He lost Illinois by a wide margin to Mitt Romney two days after saying that his campaign ''does not hinge on unemployment rates and growth rates,'' because ''there's something more foundational that's going on here.'' But according to exit polls, the economy was a top concern for Illinois voters.
For others, the vote came down not so much to something foundational, but organizational.
Judith Masoner, 65, who attended Mr. Santorum's rally in Herrin on Saturday, had donated money to his campaign. But she voted for Mr. Romney on Tuesday.
''I like the fact that he is well organized,'' Mrs. Masoner said. ''I think that if he's established as the candidate, he's ready to go.''

HEADLINE: General Mills Matches Expectations

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
General Mills posted a quarterly profit in line with Wall Street expectations on Wednesday and stood by its lowered full-year forecast as it faced higher costs for raw materials. 
''Fiscal 2012 has represented a challenging operating environment, with the highest level of commodity inflation that we've seen in 30 years,'' the chief executive, Ken Powell, said.
Mr. Powell said sales momentum in the current quarter would somewhat ease the gross margin declines that hurt results in the most recent quarter.
The company, which makes Cheerios cereal and Green Giant vegetables, among other grocery products, said income fell to $391.5 million, or 58 cents a share, from $392.1 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, earnings were 55 cents a share, matching the 55 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.
The company cut its full-year outlook in February to $2.53 to $2.55 a share from a previous forecast of $2.59 to $2.61, citing weak sales.
On Wednesday, the company stood by that full-year forecast.
Sales in the most recent quarter, which ended Feb. 26 and was the third quarter of General Mills's fiscal year, jumped 13 percent to $4.12 billion, helped by price increases and last year's acquisition of a controlling stake in the Yoplait yogurt brand. In the retail segment in the United States, the company's largest business, earnings fell 4 percent as a result of higher raw material costs, lower sales volume and higher advertising expenses.
By segment, sales rose in cereals, baking products, snacks and simple meals, were flat for Pillsbury USA and fell at Yoplait, which has suffered from increasing competition from Chobani and other Greek yogurt brands.
General Mills has said commodity costs increased 10 percent to 11 percent in fiscal 2012 because of higher prices for ingredients like grain.

HEADLINE: How Far Would You Go For a Comeback?

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
WILLISTON, N.D.
LAST spring, Bob Ripka decided the time had come for drastic change. His once-robust income from his job at a printing company was dwindling. His family lost its house in the real estate crash. And employment prospects around his home in Pine City, Minn., more than an hour north of Minneapolis, appeared scant.
He heard talk around town about plentiful work in North Dakota, where new drilling technologies are driving an oil boom. ''And I decided, 'Well, I'm going to go make some money,' '' he recalled in an interview. So on Memorial Day weekend, Mr. Ripka, 48, removed the rear seats from his 2003 Dodge minivan and replaced them with a mattress. He threw some clothes in a bag, said goodbye to his family and drove 10 hours west to Williston -- ground zero in the North Dakota petroleum explosion.
After filling out a round of applications and sleeping in his car for several nights, Mr. Ripka was offered a job driving heavy trucks for an oil services company, helping to pour cement to secure casings for new wells. 
He passed a drug test and trained for two weeks in Denver before settling, in July, into his new home away from home: a 7-by-11-foot cubicle at a ''man camp.'' A sort of cross between a military barracks and a college dormitory, temporary man camps have sprung up in and around Williston to help house the influx of workers from around the country.
Mr. Ripka is one of thousands of men with similar stories. They have descended on Williston and its environs over the last two to three years, pulled by the magnet of jobs created by an oil boom with the potential to make the region one of the largest petroleum resources in the country, and pushed by the hope that a steady income can put their finances back on track after a grueling downturn. While the national unemployment rate is 8.3 percent, in North Dakota it is 3.2 percent -- and it is 1 percent in Williams County, where Williston has grown from a population of 12,500 before the boom began in 2008 to an estimated 20,000 now.
Many newcomers are, like Mr. Ripka, middle-age family men angling for a fresh financial start. Builders cannot throw up homes fast enough to house them; an estimated 1,200 housing units are expected to be completed in Williston in the next few months, and one-bedroom apartments rent for $1,700 or more a month, if they are available. With an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 job openings in the area, many men live where they can -- in their cars, or in illegally parked campers -- and send their earnings to their families while they hunt for housing.
Because of the fast pace of oil well development to tap the Bakken shale field, the men often are on call around the clock and are away from their families for extended periods. A typical schedule might be to work 15 days straight, followed by six days off to go home. Airfare out of Williston can be steep, though, so many workers drive or take an Amtrak train, which adds travel time that cuts into their visits. (Some companies occasionally offer to put family members up in local hotels for visits.)
But not everyone goes home. The men can earn extra money -- $150 to $200 a day or more, depending on the job -- by working their scheduled days off, so many do. That means, though, that they are away from home for five weeks at a stretch, or even longer.
Mr. Ripka, for instance, was home in January but then stayed in Williston, working, through early March. It is worth the sacrifice financially, he said. Back home, he said, he made $27,000 for the last six months he worked at his printing job; after six months in Williston, he had earned $45,000.
Mr. Ripka plans to continue for about five years, long enough to pay down some debt, including a loan his parents took out to help finance the purchase of the home in Pine City where his family lives. He said his credit was marred by the loss of the family's former home in a short sale, in which the lender agreed to accept less than what was owed, so his parents pitched in to help.
''I'd rather be home every day and see my family,'' he said. ''But this economy nowadays, you got to do what you got to do.''
Mr. Ripka is one of the lucky ones in Williston, as far as housing: his employer, the Sanjel Corporation, contracts to house its workers at a man camp, so his lodging and meals are subsidized.
One afternoon last month, Mr. Ripka gave a tour of his camp, operated by Atco Structures and Logistics, a Canadian company. The ''lodge,'' as Atco calls it, comprises four, 49-room modular dormitories. His room has a twin bed, a cabinet, a television and DVD player, a chair and a single window. A blue felt blanket hung tenuously over the blinds, secured with tape -- Mr. Ripka's attempt, when working night shifts, to block out the daylight while he sleeps.
Mr. Ripka says long hours help him to sleep soundly most of the time -- but not always. The walls are thin, and other workers may come and go at different hours. One neighbor sometimes forgets to adjust his alarm clock when his shift changes; its ''beep, beep, beep'' echoed down the hall.
Mr. Ripka installed a small refrigerator so he can get a cold drink without walking to the camp's communal kitchen, but has otherwise made no attempt to personalize his living space. ''I'm here to work,'' he shrugged.
Back in the hallway, he opened an exit door to reveal the vista that stretches for miles across the brown, rolling prairie, and shared a joke oft repeated by men at the camp. It is, he said, ''The kind of place where you can watch your dog run away, for three days.''
Just inside the exit door sits a bin filled with blue surgical bootees. Workers must either take off their boots, or slip the covers over them when they come inside, to help keep out the ever-present mud. When the men forget and track in grime, ''We scold them, and make them clean it up,'' said Sally Hojnacki, an assistant manager at the lodge, who also acts as a sort of adviser and den mother to the residents.
The ''no-boots'' edict is one of about two dozen rules given to the men on laminated cards when they arrive. Others include a ban on alcohol in common areas, no smoking inside the camp and no visitors after 10:30 p.m.
The many restrictions grate on one of Mr. Ripka's fellow campers, Randall Ervin, 38, of Beaverton, Ore. ''Here I am 40 years old and it's like I got a mom, you know what I mean?'' said Mr. Ervin, a burly, gregarious sort who works as an oil field pump operator. ''You're not really free to do anything you want to.''
Nevertheless, Mr. Ervin said, coming to North Dakota has been the start of a financial rebound and, he hopes, a new career. A native of Heflin, Ala., he proudly wears a University of Alabama lanyard around his neck. ''Roll, Tide!'' he said, smiling, evoking Alabama's nickname, the Crimson Tide.
He joined the Navy after high school and eventually settled in the Portland area, where he met his fiancee, Melani Stewart, while playing arena football. The couple has twin 5-year-old girls; Mr. Ervin's son from a previous relationship lives with the boy's mother.
Mr. Ervin started a firm in Oregon that did drilling for underground conduits used by communications companies. But even though Mr. Ervin's being an African-American meant his company qualified for minority-business status, it was increasingly underbid for contracts by larger companies, he said. The venture went belly up. Soon, he and Ms. Stewart were hard-pressed to pay the mortgage on the half of a duplex she had owned when they met. Ms. Stewart's job as a supply planner at Nike was secure, so they borrowed against her 401(k) to make ends meet.
''We ran through our money pretty quick,'' he said. ''We started to struggle.'' They ran up nearly $30,000 in debt, in part to pay medical bills after Mr. Ervin injured his knee while repairing his truck. They were reluctant to confide their troubles to family members and friends, so Ms. Stewart juggled bills, clipped coupons and skipped haircuts to save money, while Mr. Ervin scoured help-wanted ads. While out on walks to help his knee mend, Mr. Ervin picked up cans and redeemed them for the deposits. ''If we'd get $10 to $15, we used it,'' he said. ''Did what we had to do.''
IN August, the couple was ''a month behind on the mortgage and headed for disaster,'' Mr. Ervin recalled, when he saw an ad on Craigslist, seeking heavy equipment operators willing to travel. Even after the recruiter told him the job was in the oil fields of North Dakota, where subzero temperatures in the double digits are common in the winter, Mr. Ervin didn't waver.
''At this point in my life, I didn't care,'' he said. ''It was either sink or swim, and I thought I'd try the swim part.''
He drove nearly eight hours to an interview in Post Falls, Idaho, and three days later was told the job was his. He next set out to Billings, Mont., with $100 in cash, for a two-week training period. The men were fed breakfast, but he had to buy the rest of his meals. ''I would buy a sandwich and eat half for lunch and save the other half for dinner,'' he recalled, ''just so I wouldn't blow through my money so fast.''
Now, all his meals are provided at the Atco camp. The cooks serve up hearty if bland fare, including prime rib once a week, along with mashed potatoes and gravy, in the cafeteria. Like Mr. Ripka, Mr. Ervin sometimes works on his time off to make more money -- an extra $1,200 if he works all of his six days off -- which helps raise his annual salary to about $80,000. He and Ms. Stewart have paid off about $8,000 in credit card debt and are planning to take their children to Disney World this summer.
''It's been worth it financially,'' he said. ''I don't know what we would have done, honestly.''
Mr. Ervin said he did not mind hard work, but he did yearn for his home life. ''I think the hardest thing is just missing the everyday things that go on at home, you know?'' he said. ''I think I miss most my kids jumping in bed with us like at 7 or 8 in the morning. I still get a kick out of it even though they are getting bigger.''
He does not foresee moving his family to Williston, but he hopes to work two more years in the field and then, perhaps, move into an administrative role, helping to train new employees for Sanjel somewhere else -- Texas, perhaps. ''I might just ride this thing until the wheels fall off,'' he said.
About 14 miles outside Williston, Guy Miramontes found his second chance working in the kitchen of another man camp, the Solsten Hotel. Mr. Miramontes, 52, had worked as a cook in Las Vegas, but found himself jobless last year as the recession and the housing crisis weighed on the city's economy.
As months passed while he looked unsuccessfully for work, he became depressed. He and his wife, Imelda, stressed about how they would pay their bills, began fighting, he said. They had bought a house at the height of the housing market for $240,000, he said; its value fell to about $80,000.
One day last summer, he saw a television report on the oil boom in Williston. Soon he could think of nothing else, and told Imelda he was going to North Dakota. ''I could stay there and wallow in the self-pity of what we were going through,'' he said. ''But as we sink, eventually we'd be on the street, too.''
In early September, he put a small fold-up mattress in his Honda CR-V, along with an alarm clock and a pair of heavy boots; he was hoping for oil field work, but packed his set of chef's knives, just in case. ''I drove straight through for 24 hours, white knuckle the whole way,'' he said. He packed peanut butter and jelly and beef jerky, so he would not have to spend much on food.
He parked at the Wal-Mart in Williston, for what he hoped would be a brief stretch of living in his car before finding work. ''Actually it wasn't that easy,'' he said. ''I stayed in my car for three weeks.'' He learned to move his car around the lot throughout the day, following the shade. (The Wal-Mart has since stopped the practice of newcomers' sleeping in its parking lot, according to Williston's mayor, Ward Koeser.) He showered at a local recreation center, and ate as cheaply as he could at a local sandwich shop. He visited the local library daily, to check his e-mail for possible replies to job applications.
After a week, Imelda pleaded with him to return home, but Mr. Miramontes felt desperate. One day, driving around, he passed a man camp under construction, housing a skeleton crew. He walked in the back door, in his cowboy boots and carrying a resume, and found the catering manager. ''I'm looking for work and I'm a real good cook,'' he told him. He called daily, repeating the same thing.
Finally, the cook on duty needed a week off, and Mr. Miramontes had his chance. He was hired, and has worked there since. He goes on duty at 11 p.m. and works until 11 a.m. preparing breakfast for the camp and readying food for two days ahead. ''These people come in tired from work and they want to eat on time,'' he said. ''They are up there to make money. That's what it's all about, to have a better life.''
He is grateful for the job, but bitter at the economic mess that pushed him into it. Coming to North Dakota ''was by choice,'' he said, ''but a forced choice.''
For now, Mr. Miramontes is not looking too far into the future. He has a son who is grown and on his own, but he worries about having to be far away from his mother, 81, who lives outside Las Vegas. His wife, who works for a Las Vegas hotel, may consider moving out to join him eventually, if it looks as if the boom will last a while. ''I'll put in as many years as I'm able to,'' he said.
Back at home, the women with children must adjust to being single parents for weeks or even months at a time. For Danette Radermacher, Mr. Ripka's partner of 22 years, duties now include digging out after snowstorms, without Mr. Ripka's help.
At the end of February, with northern Minnesota under a severe storm warning, Ms. Radermacher woke every couple of hours to check the weather, and watched as the drifts piled up against the kitchen window. The couple's sons, 17 and 10, are old enough to help with chores like shoveling snow. But she is keenly aware that she is the sole adult there, no matter how many times she speaks to Mr. Ripka on the phone.
''I get nervous when it snows,'' she said in a phone interview just after the storm. ''What if we lose power?''
Despite the challenges, Ms. Radermacher said Mr. Ripka's new job had thrown the family a financial lifeline. Although she is a registered nurse, Ms. Radermacher had only been able to find work locally as a home health aide, covering the overnight shift on weekends so she could work while her boys slept. So when the opportunity came up in North Dakota, she agreed Mr. Ripka should go. She considered going, too, with the boys, since nurses are in demand in Williston and she could very likely find good work. But their older son is nearly finished with high school, and they did not want to make him leave his friends so close to graduation, ''We have to do what we have to do.''
Even when she is not trapped in the house by the weather, she is often lonely. Entertainment is mostly watching cable television, and taking her sons to play after-school sports. ''Sometimes,'' she said with a wry laugh, ''I forget how to talk to adults.''
THE separation is hard on the children, too. They like that their parents can now afford to buy them electronic gadgets as birthday gifts, Ms. Radermacher said. But Mr. Ripka's job meant missing his son Dakota's 10th birthday in February. During Mr. Ripka's visit home in January, the boy presented his father with a jar of spare change, and asked if it were enough to pay for a family trip to the beach.
Mr. Ripka decided that they had earned a family vacation, and that he would work extra weeks to pay for it. When Ms. Radermacher was told by her employer that she would be denied time off from her job for the trip, she said, she quit in frustration. She has been applying for jobs locally, but has not yet landed one. Mr. Ripka took the train from Williston on March 6, meeting with his family before heading to Florida for a week together in the sun.
In Oregon, Ms. Stewart is coping as best she can in Mr. Ervin's absence. ''It's lonely, especially when he's out on long jobs,'' she said in a phone interview. ''He can't always call.''
They tried video chats using Skype for a while, but often when Mr. Ervin has time to talk, the girls are in bed. So she takes pictures of their daughters to show him when he comes home, to help keep him connected with what they are doing. And they make the most of Mr. Ervin's visits home, hiring a sitter so they can have date nights.
To save money, Mr. Ervin takes Amtrak -- less than $300, instead of two or three times that for airfare. The trip takes nearly 24 hours and cuts two days off his visit. But the time gives him a chance to decompress and mentally prepare for the transition to home life. ''So when he gets here,'' she said, ''it's not such a shock, jumping into swimming lessons, and whatever we're doing.'' Mr. Ervin typically volunteers at his daughters' preschool.
His job has let them stem a scary financial spiral and opened the door to a new career for Mr. Ervin, so Ms. Stewart makes the best of the situation. Once their finances are back on track, the couple can perhaps think about setting a wedding date, she said. ''I almost feel like I can't complain,'' she said. ''This is a choice we've made. I can't sit home and feel sad.''
Still, she is unsure how long they will keep up the extended separations. ''For now, it needs to be done,'' she said. ''But there has to be light at the end of the tunnel.''
While the men's families muddle through at home, workdays can stretch around the clock in Williston, depending on the situation at the drilling sites. During their off time, some of the men at the Atco camp gather in a common area for darts, cribbage or television; the local movie theater has limited showings during the week.
A sort of camaraderie has evolved, based on the shared experience of long hours and loneliness. A half-dozen men in Mr. Ripka's work group were temporarily bald this winter, having shaved their heads together as part of an autism fund-raiser. On weekends, there are outings for pitchers of icy, light beer at D.K.'s, a Williston watering hole where visitors are scanned with security wands, like at the airport. A bouncer with a curly mullet scans driver's licenses into a hand-held gadget; if the holder makes trouble, he explains, he or she will not be allowed in again.
On a recent Friday night, a gang of workers from the Atco lodge drove to D.K.'s, where the scene was a sort of college mixer meets biker bar. The men watched as girls in jeans and heavy boots line-danced until, emboldened by beer and the thumping beat of Lady Gaga, younger flannel-clad men joined them on the dance floor, mugs in hand.
At about 10:30, women in decidedly different attire -- short, skintight dresses -- teetered onto the dance floor, in spike heels. Prostitutes, as well as oil workers, are said to be doing a brisk business in Williston.
The separation can strain even strong relationships. One camper said his wife objected to his removing his wedding ring while at work, even though it is advisable for safety. Another said he would not let his girlfriend visit him in Williston; he worried that he would be too jealous, with all the men around.
The men, too, worry about their partners left home alone. ''If you don't have a lady at home that you can trust, you are going to have a hard time up here,'' Mr. Ervin said.
Yet, some of the men are reluctant to bring their wives and children to live in Williston, which has developed a decidedly gritty, frontier-town feel. Recently, the local news has been dominated by the story of a woman in nearby Sidney, Mont., who was kidnapped and, it is presumed, murdered while jogging; two Colorado men said to have been looking for oil field work have been charged in her disappearance. And in late February, the local newspaper ran an article saying that the number of registered sex offenders in the area had doubled over the previous year because of the influx of newcomers.
Mayor Koeser calls the rapid growth a ''crisis'' that has strained local resources with, among other challenges, increased traffic and litter, often blowing out of pickup trucks used for shelter.
Patrick Schneider, 30, left his wife and 3-year-old daughter back in Bemidji, Minn., to work pouring cement for oil wells around Williston. His employer is building family housing, and the couple is considering applying for it so they can be reunited on a regular basis. But the recent headlines gave him pause. ''I think it's a good town, but they say crime is getting bad,'' he said. ''I'd hate to move them out here and have something happen. That would be horrible.''
While many of the men plan to stick it out as long as they can take it, some decide relatively soon that being separated from their families is more than they can handle. Ronald Powell, a native of Winter Haven, Fla., lasted about four months as a heavy equipment operator for an oil field services contractor before throwing in the towel.
Mr. Powell had been out of work for some time when he was hired last fall at $25 per hour to drive trucks in Williston; he settled into a man camp operated by Target Logistics.
A gruff, churchgoing man, with hands like catcher's mitts, Mr. Powell said he was often uncomfortable in the rough-and-tumble environment of Williston. Yet things were tolerable, until he had a disagreement with his employer over working conditions and, he said, a proposed pay cut. So when a company in Florida offered him $18 an hour to work back home, he quickly accepted it. Speaking by phone after leaving Sunday services in Winter Haven with his granddaughter, Mr. Powell said he was bitter about his treatment by his employer, but had no regrets about trying out the work life in Williston.
''Everything,'' he said, ''happens for a reason.''

PERSON: Sanford McDonnell 

HEADLINE: Sanford McDonnell, 89, Aerospace Leader

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
Sanford N. McDonnell, who succeeded his uncle as chairman of the aerospace company McDonnell Douglas and, through the 1980s, modernized its management systems, remade the corporate culture and sharply increased earnings, died on Monday at his home in Clayton, Mo. He was 89.
The cause was complications of pancreatic cancer, his son, Randall, said. 
Mr. McDonnell, an engineer, became chairman of the company in 1980 after the death of its founder, his uncle James Smith McDonnell, who had run it for four decades.
The younger Mr. McDonnell set out to make the corporate culture less autocratic and to turn around its unprofitable commercial airline division. He also helped develop some of the company's most successful fighter planes, including the F-4 Phantom II.
During his tenure, the company's earnings rose sharply, and new management made the commercial airline division profitable, though the company remained slow to invest in new technology.
Mr. McDonnell was chief executive when McDonnell Douglas completed the Skylab space station in 1973.
Sanford Noyes McDonnell was born on Oct. 12, 1922, in Little Rock, Ark. The family moved to St. Louis after his uncle chose it as a safer place to build military aircraft than the coasts. The McDonnell Aircraft Corporation became the city's largest employer.
Mr. McDonnell had planned to follow his father into finance, majoring in economics at Princeton, but was diverted by World War II.
In the Army, he trained as an engineer and worked in New Mexico as a technician on the Manhattan Project, which built the first atomic bomb. In a history he wrote for the Atomic Heritage Foundation, Mr. McDonnell said that as a ''lowly G.I.'' he had not contributed anything of note to the project, and that security was so tight that most of the soldiers did not know what they were working on. ''At the end of the work day, I remember washing my hands until I no longer got a reading on the Geiger counter,'' he wrote.
After his discharge, Mr. McDonnell married Priscilla Robb of Albuquerque, whom he had met on the ski slopes of New Mexico. He received an engineering degree from the University of Colorado and went back to St. Louis to work for his uncle, who offered to start him at a janitor's salary. Mr. McDonnell, whose wife was pregnant, talked him up to a trainee's salary.
Mr. McDonnell rose through the ranks, becoming the group leader overseeing the F-101 Voodoo, a supersonic fighter jet, in 1955.
The McDonnell Aircraft Corporation merged with the Douglas Aircraft Company in 1967, and Mr. McDonnell became chief executive in 1972. (The Boeing Company bought McDonnell Douglas in 1997.)
After four employees were indicted on charges that they had paid off foreign officials, Mr. McDonnell developed an ethics code and training program for employees.
Mr. McDonnell was known for his attention to ethics and devotion to the Boy Scouts creed. He served as national president of the Boy Scouts of America in the 1980s.
He was fond of quoting Benjamin Franklin, Isaac Newton and George Washington from memory and was meticulous about accounting for even the smallest use of company resources, like a postage stamp, for his personal business.
After he retired in 1988 he founded Characterplus, a St. Louis-based organization that has helped 77 school districts integrate ethics into their curriculums and that says its efforts have improved academic performance and decreased disciplinary actions. He also helped organize the Character Education Partnership in Washington, which works to develop moral character in young people.
Besides his wife and son, Mr. McDonnell is survived by a daughter, Robbin McDonnell MacVittie, and one grandchild.

HEADLINE: Europe Plan Spells Out Retaliation Over Bids

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- In a move likely to increase tensions over protectionism in international trade, Chinese, American or Japanese companies could be blocked from bidding for public contracts in Europe if their home countries are thought to be excluding bids from European firms.
A plan outlined Wednesday represents a significant shift in European thinking, reflecting frustration in countries like France that the European Union does not appear to receive reciprocal treatment on public procurement contracts from non-Europeans. 
Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president who is campaigning for re-election, has called for a ''Buy European Act'' modeled on United States laws that favor domestically made products.
But while supporters of the proposal from the bloc's executive, the European Commission, say it is meant to end unfair competition, critics contend that the plan risks increasing protectionism and inciting trade wars.
A British official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with official policy, said it was akin to ''hoisting a big flag over Europe saying, 'Closed for business.' ''
Though China is the main target of the proposed legislation, European officials also think they face discrimination in the United States and Japan, both of which are part of the General Procurement Agreement in the World Trade Organization, a deal intended to create a level playing field in this area.
The measures proposed Wednesday would offer a way of dealing both with countries that are part of the procurement agreement and with developing countries that remain outside. European officials say they would be used as a lever to open markets rather than as a protectionist tool.
''Our commercial partners apply a lot of protectionist measures to their procurement market,'' Michel Barnier, the European commissioner for the internal market, said at a press conference on Wednesday. ''This is true of the U.S. and Japan, where we have the G.P.A. agreement. It is also true of countries that don't fall under the G.P.A., the emerging countries where we have no secure access.''
Mr. Barnier added in a statement that the European Union ''should no longer be naive and should aim for fairness and reciprocity in world trade.''
Karel De Gucht, the European trade commissioner, said the plan would ''increase the leverage of the E.U. in international negotiations.''
The reaction from Beijing was dismissive even before the formal announcement.
''The E.U.'s new pact, when adopted, won't have an immediate effect on Chinese companies bidding for E.U. contracts and won't scare China into making concessions over the government procurement agreement proposal, as they expect,'' Suo Bicheng, director of the Department of World Trade Organization Affairs at China's Ministry of Commerce, was quoted as saying Wednesday in the official China Daily newspaper.
He added that it was unlikely that China, which entered the W.T.O. in 2001, would join the procurement agreement this year.
Under the plan, which needs the approval of the 27 members of the European Union and the European Parliament, the authorities in Europe could exclude foreign companies from competing for contracts worth more than 5 million euros, or $6.5 million, if European companies are being excluded by the bidder's home country.
The European Commission, which would have to approve any exclusion, expects around 30 to 40 applications a year for contracts that would meet the criteria.
The commission would also have a broader mechanism allowing it to restrict access to the European market for countries that limit the access of European Union companies to their markets.
The office of the United States trade representative said Wednesday that it had no comment yet because it had not seen the formal European proposal.

Extreme Childproofing
Re ''Is It Safe to Play Yet?'' by Michael Tortorello (March 15):
To the Editor: 
By focusing on a few extreme examples of ''obsessed'' parents with time and money to spare, the article undermined the very real health threats that household toxic chemicals pose on a population-wide scale and, in particular, the way that the chemical burden falls heavily on the poor and certain minorities.
Children from disadvantaged backgrounds carry higher than average levels of phthalates, metals, PCBs, and VOCs in their bodies, to name just a few.
And while it's one thing to toss a tube of expensive lipstick because it contains lead, it's harder -- and more important -- to question why some of the most toxic (and often-untested) cosmetics on the market are hair relaxers marketed specifically to African-American women. Chemical safety reform is not a frivolous pastime for the rich; it's a matter of social justice.
Blair Braverman
Iowa City
To the Editor:
I worked in a molecular biology lab for several years, and toxic, dangerous chemicals are everywhere: it's the nature of the work. When they are unavoidable, the best thing you can do is protect yourself, use them correctly and safely. I've tried to use the same approach with my young daughter. If I don't need a dangerous chemical, I don't use it. My kitchen counters get cleaned with vinegar and borax, but my bathrooms get cleaned with mildew remover and toilet bowl cleaner. I've explained to my child that these chemicals are dangerous to her, because she is still growing, and she must keep away from them. She sees me using rubber gloves, and opening the windows, and telling her to stay downstairs. She gets it. She doesn't play with chemicals at all, and if she finds a can of something in the house, she comes and asks if it's safe for her to touch.
Other than that, as parents we are careful about the toys, food and art supplies we purchase for her. Very soon these children in the article will go to school, they will go to birthday parties, and sleepovers; as parents we lose control of the components of their environment very rapidly. Hopefully, teaching them to make good choices and to avoid potential danger counts for something.
Mary Ann Sharma
Austin, Tex.
To the Editor:
We middle-class parents with time and energy to spare obsess over every detail of our children's environment, safety, nutrition, emotional state and education. Meanwhile, ever-larger proportions of the nation's children go to bed hungry, are shuffled into daycare at early hours of the morning, deal with depressed, unemployed parents, spend all afternoon watching television, or attend terrible schools. They live in apartments and old houses with rats and peeling paint. They sleep in hand-me-down cribs or on old sofa beds. I see them playing in the street late at night or on the playground under the lax supervision of older kids.
These are the kids we should be worrying about. Please, all you parents who are so obsessed about the environment, can you channel your energies into getting laws in place that will protect all our kids, not just the ones whose parents can afford new ''green'' products?

HEADLINE: Student-Driven PAC Aims to Blunt G.O.P. in South

BYLINE: By BRET SCHULTE

 BODY:
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- The last Democratic stronghold in the South is in the care of a new set of guardians: graduate students, mostly.
At a party last month, a group in their 20s, many of them enrolled in the Clinton School of Public Service at the University of Arkansas, unveiled a new state and federal PAC. Called Naturally Blue, its aim is to maintain the tenuous majority of Democrats in the Arkansas legislature to promote an agenda of economic populism and to take the fight to the rest of Dixie.
In a state where Democrats suffered heavy losses in 2010, the new PAC was well received, with the party reeling in about 300 guests, including a former Democratic governor, Jim Guy Tucker, and about $13,000. 
The founders believe that the economics of the South -- namely its concentrated poverty -- make the region ''naturally blue.'' Nate Looney, the PAC's 25-year-old president, cites a report by the Southern Education Foundation in Atlanta showing that 42 percent of the nation's most impoverished children live in the South. ''Yet their parents show up and vote against their best interests,'' Mr. Looney argues.
His assessment notwithstanding, the South, of course, is mostly red. The legislatures of the old Confederacy are solidly Republican. All but two states -- Arkansas and North Carolina -- have Republican governors.
And in Arkansas, Democratic control has slipped. Fueled by anger over the health care law, voters in 2010 added two Republicans to their House delegation and retained a third, leaving one Democrat. The Republicans also picked up one of the state's two Senate seats in 2010. In the state legislature, Republicans gained 24 seats.
Clint Reed, a former director of the Arkansas Republican Party and a public opinion consultant, said that in 2006 Democrats had a 13-point advantage over Republicans among voters in a generic Congressional race, according to his firm. Now, that number is reversed.
In Arkansas, ''you've had, in the Democratic Party all these years, larger-than-life political figures,'' said Mr. Reed, citing not only Bill Clinton but also Dale Bumpers and David Pryor, who were popular governors and senators dating to the 1970s. ''They've always been able to keep conservative white rural voters in their tent. That coalition really crumbled in 2010.''
Now, Republican enthusiasm is so high that a record number have filed this year for state offices and have no need for an equivalent PAC, Mr. Reed said. ''The Republican stuff is happening organically,'' he said.
The Republican surge of 2010 inspired Naturally Blue. That September, Mr. Looney and his best friend, Will Whiting, both Democrats and Razorbacks fans, watched their football team lose what now seems like a symbolic battle against the Crimson Tide of Alabama. Dejected, the two decided that night to get in the game, at least politically.
They traveled around the country for months getting advice, meeting with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, studying redistricting maps and census data, and reaching out to Hispanic groups. The two brought in Marc Peters, 25, also of the Clinton School.
Mr. Looney, the University of Arkansas student body president in 2009, is finishing a dual degree from the Clinton School and the University of Arkansas Bowen School of Law this May. Mr. Peters was the national student blog director for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. And Mr. Whiting held fund-raising posts at the University of Arkansas and Arkansas Children's Hospital. Now he works for the Little Rock Chamber of Commerce and knows every deep pocket in the state.
''This will be grass roots in a way that most PACs aren't,'' said Mr. Peters, referring to the ''super PACs'' powering this election cycle. ''We're interested in voter registration, going door to door, hosting town halls and taking on Republicans in areas where they assume they're going to win.''
Their first move is to tackle booming northwest Arkansas, a longtime Republican bastion that is home to Walmart and Tyson Foods. They are recruiting candidates and urging them to stand their ground on economic and social justice issues like the health care overhaul. (They are less eager to engage on ''wedge issues'' like abortion.) The PAC's promotional literature encourages donations from across the country, noting that ''for the cost of one 30-second spot in New York, we can run seven'' in Arkansas, which they see as the best staging ground for taking back the South.
Meredith McGehee, policy director of the Campaign Legal Center in Washington, has seen this sort of PAC before. She says the odds are stacked against them. ''A PAC like this,'' she said, ''is going to face a rather dark challenge if they don't get a sugar daddy somewhere.''
That has not happened yet. Mr. Whiting, the fund-raiser, said they first wanted a swell of support to prove their viability. To help get there, Naturally Blue recently held another party in an affluent Little Rock neighborhood to mark the state's deadline to file for political office.
Standing atop a chair at Browning's Mexican Grill, Mr. Looney cheered the Democrats who had filed. He singled out Diana Gonzales Worthen, a Latina educator in northwest Arkansas running for the State Senate. Having studied the demographics -- the district is 40 percent minority -- Naturally Blue encouraged her to run. He introduced Ms. Gonzales Worthen, almost 20 years his senior, as an ''up-and-coming star.''
Waging an uphill fight, the newcomers still managed to catch the attention of the Democratic old guard. ''I'm only here because my law school friend David Pryor'' -- the former governor -- ''called me and said I need to get over here,'' said Herb Rule, who served in the state legislature in the late 1960s and is now running for Congress in the state's Second District.
''It's a great idea,'' he said of the PAC. ''We'll see if it works.''

HEADLINE: House G.O.P. Budget Riles Some on the Right, and Democrats See a Campaign Issue

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House Republicans pressed forward on Wednesday with a politically freighted budget and tax plan, taking fire from the left and the right, as well as from the powerful senior citizens lobby, AARP, which said the plan ''lacks balance'' and ''jeopardizes the health and economic security of older Americans.''
Before the House Budget Committee passed the plan on Wednesday night, its advocates were running a gantlet of opposition. Writing ''on behalf of over 38 million members,'' the AARP's chief executive, A. Barry Rand, said the budget would ''likely 'price out' traditional Medicare as a viable option'' and harm Medicaid and food stamps. In the end, the bill squeaked through in an 18-to-19 vote, with 2 Republican defections. 
On the right, the conservative political action committee Club for Growth said the budget ''falls short'' by not balancing the budget in a decade and nullifying automatic, across-the-board spending cuts agreed to in last summer's Budget Control Act in the event that a special select committee on deficit reduction failed to agree on bipartisan deficit controls.
''The Club for Growth urges Republicans to support a budget that balances in the near future and complies with the Budget Control Act,'' said Chris Chocola, the group's president.
Democrats wasted no time turning what Republicans called a sober, sensible document into a campaign platform. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee wrote a fund-raising e-mail. The Democratic National Committee leapt on supportive comments from Mitt Romney. And individual candidates immediately took their critique of the budget to voters.
''I think it's huge -- I really do,'' said Dan Maffei, who is running to reclaim a House seat in a Democratic-leaning upstate New York district from Ann Marie Buerkle, the Republican who unseated him in 2010. ''To be running in a Middle American district with lots of seniors who understand how Medicare works on a platform of privatizing Medicare, it's fitting a round peg into a square hole.''
Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the chairman of the budget committee, pleaded for restraint.
''We can't afford to keep acting like politicians,'' he said. ''This country needs leaders, and what leaders do is they see a problem on the horizon, they know what it's going to do to their country and their children and they stop it from happening.''
But as more information emerged on the Republican budget, opposition continued to grow. Under questioning, the Republican staff director of the budget committee, Austin Smythe, said the budget was likely to cut transportation financing by $40 billion to $50 billion in the coming fiscal year alone. White House officials said steep domestic spending cuts would push 200,000 children from Head Start, while denying access to food assistance to 1.8 million infants, children and pregnant and post-partum women.
''I'm happy that you introduced this document,'' said Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, as the Budget Committee began its drafting. ''I'm happy to run against it, politically, economically, any way you want.'' A California Democrat, Representative Michael M. Honda, urged his colleagues to ''reject the radical, regressive Republican notion that the only way to maintain sustainability is to cut every program indispensable to the American people.''
Republicans say the plan's failure will consign the country to what Mr. Ryan called ''debt and decline.'' But as they portrayed themselves as the responsible adults in the room making the hard choice, they were muddying the waters with simultaneous attacks on Democrats for their own Medicare cuts.
Asked whether the National Republican Congressional Committee would campaign on the Ryan budget, its spokesman, Paul Lindsay, said it was focused on attacking Democrats for $500 billion of Medicare cuts in the 2010 health care law.
On the House floor, Republicans pressed legislation to repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a group of independent advisers created by the health care law and empowered to find ways to hold down Medicare costs. The bill is expected to pass Thursday.
And a new conservative group, American Doctors for Truth, broadcast advertisements in Florida and Texas that showed President Obama pushing an elderly woman out of her wheelchair and over a cliff. The ad was patterned on a similar one that ran last year in a special House election in upstate New York.
''We felt obligated as physicians to step forward and start a dialogue with the American people,'' said Dr. Jane Hughes, an ophthalmologist in San Antonio who is one of the physicians financing the ad.
The Ryan budget will go no further than the House. The Democratic-controlled Senate will not take it up, and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, has said he has no intention of bringing a budget to a vote for the third straight year.
But the Ryan plan's most immediate problems will come from the right. Representative Tim Huelskamp, Republican of Kansas, said the plan did not cut spending as much as he promised he would in his maiden run for Congress in 2010. He also objected to ''reneging'' on the debt deal of July, which promised more than a trillion dollars in cuts to domestic and defense programs if a broader deficit control agreement could not be reached.
''It's good, but not good enough,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Romney's Day to Relish Is Marred by Aide's Gaffe

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG; Ashley Parker contributed reporting from Arbutus, Md.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney sought to use the coveted endorsement of Jeb Bush on Wednesday to amplify his call for Republicans to rally behind his candidacy and get on with the mission of ousting President Obama.
As Mr. Romney savored a decisive victory in the Illinois primary on Tuesday over Rick Santorum, he learned that Mr. Bush -- whose family name and appeal to both conservatives and moderates makes him as much an embodiment of the Republican establishment as anyone -- was declaring his support and urging Republican voters to follow him.
The announcement provided Mr. Romney with additional ammunition to persuade other party leaders and constituencies that his nomination is all but inevitable and seemed to close off efforts by restless Republicans to coax Mr. Bush into the race.
''Now is the time for Republicans to unite behind Governor Romney and take our message of fiscal conservatism and job creation to all voters this fall,'' Mr. Bush said, calling him ''a leader who understands the economy.'' 
But if the endorsement held the potential to further choke off the oxygen to Mr. Santorum's insurgent candidacy, the Romney campaign inadvertently gave Mr. Santorum a new supply when a senior adviser went on CNN and seemed to suggest that Mr. Romney's conservative positions in the primary season could change like an Etch a Sketch drawing.
''I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign,'' Eric Fehrnstrom, a longtime adviser to Mr. Romney, said in response to a question about pivoting to a matchup with Mr. Obama and appealing to moderate swing voters. ''Everything changes. It's almost like an Etch a Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.''
The reference to a children's drawing toy that erases the last image with a simple shake immediately fed attacks from Mr. Romney's rivals that he was an untrustworthy standard-bearer for the conservative cause.
''You take whatever he said and you can shake it up and it will be gone and he's going to draw a whole new picture for the general election,'' Mr. Santorum said while campaigning in Louisiana, which votes Saturday. ''Well that should be comforting to all of you who are voting in this primary.''
Later, Mr. Santorum's spokeswoman, Alice Stewart, handed Etch a Sketches to reporters covering Mr. Romney's town hall-style meeting in Arbutus, Md.
In a Twitter message Newt Gingrich wrote, ''Etch a Sketch is a great toy, but a losing strategy.''
The comments from Mr. Fehrnstrom followed a Romney campaign pattern of committing unforced errors after major victories. And they flared throughout the day from Republicans and Democrats alike, moving beyond politics into a hard-to-forget moment of popular culture that could be difficult for Mr. Romney to shake.
Even Rush Limbaugh questioned whether the remark was an error or a deliberate campaign strategy to send the message, ''Don't worry, we'll do the right things to get the moderates.''
The Romney campaign at first dismissed the criticism. At an afternoon rally in Maryland, Mr. Romney initially swatted away reporters who tried to pose questions, but later said his adviser simply was referring to the mechanics of a larger campaign.
''The issues I'm running on will be exactly the same,'' Mr. Romney said. ''I'm running as a conservative Republican, I was a conservative Republican governor, I'll be running as a conservative Republican nominee -- or, excuse me, at that point, hopefully, nominee for president.''
The dustup competed with Mr. Romney's intensified efforts on Wednesday to bring new and not-so-subtle pressure on Mr. Santorum to drop his candidacy, arguing that his chances were fading with Mr. Romney's widening lead in the delegate and popular vote counts and endorsements from the likes of Mr. Bush.
But they are treading carefully and with the full knowledge that Mr. Santorum has no plans to step aside now and that to push him too far is to risk backlash from his ardent supporters in upcoming primary states.
''He is smart enough to know that to have a future in the party, for a role in the government, or to run again or whatever, there will come a time when he needs to be a team player,'' Charlie Black, an informal adviser to Mr. Romney and a veteran Republican presidential strategist, said of Mr. Santorum.
But, he said in an interview, ''We're not there yet.'' He added, ''We're halfway through the process, and he can still see a scenario by which he may win, even if an objective person may say that's sort of threading the needle.''
Mindful of its tone, a directive was sent from the campaign's headquarters in Boston telling aides and advisers not to openly urge the other Republican candidates to get out of the race. For now, an adviser said, it was probably better for Mr. Romney to have three opponents splitting votes among themselves rather than having a singular alternative to Mr. Romney.
Yet senior Republican advisers in governors' offices across the country and on Capitol Hill said Wednesday that the tide was unmistakably turning toward Mr. Romney, even though levels of enthusiasm were mixed. Mr. Romney was scheduled to attend a fund-raiser on Thursday to try and improve his connection with Congressional Republicans.
Russ Walker, a vice president of Freedomworks, an influential Tea Party organization that has been critical of Mr. Romney, said Wednesday that Mr. Romney was moving closer to winning the Republican nomination. He said he feared that a prolonged primary campaign would distract Republicans from Senate races.
But suggestions that Mr. Romney was on his way to becoming the nominee was not a sentiment shared by the campaigns of Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich, who are urging conservative activists and party leaders against a rush to judgment. His rivals are not only not contemplating dropping out, but were taking steps to move forward.
As post-Illinois news media chatter began focusing on a ''one-man race'' and the ''beginning of the end'' for Mr. Santorum's insurgent bid, Mr. Santorum's campaign was vying for another Southern victory on Saturday in Louisiana, where both campaigns consider him to be leading.
He was also looking ahead to the April 24 primary in his home state of Pennsylvania, where he hopes to secure a major win on a day that several big Romney-leaning states vote, including New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island.
Mr. Santorum has also repeatedly worked to win the endorsement of governors and donors who had once backed Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. (He also has called Mr. Perry, two aides said, in hopes of nudging him away from his endorsement of Mr. Gingrich.)

HEADLINE: A Sigh of Relief: U.S. Notes Europe's Progress In Easing Its Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For the United States, the looming threat from the long-simmering European sovereign debt crisis seems finally to have started to subside.
European leaders did not combat the crisis with the force American policy makers had urged. But a Continent-wide agreement to slash deficits and lifelines tossed to European banks have helped reduce borrowing costs, and Washington now seems to be breathing a tentative sigh of relief.
Serious concerns remain about Europe's impact on financial markets and growth, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said Wednesday in testimony before the House oversight committee. But Europe has made progress in assuring investors of the safety of the euro and ensuring that all euro zone economies retain financing for their debts at sustainable rates. 
''In the past few months, financial stresses in Europe have lessened, which has contributed to an improved tone of financial markets around the world, including in the United States,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
Mr. Geithner said, ''The European economies at the center of the crisis have made very significant progress.''
In Europe, bond yields have dropped in Italy and France, among other countries. Action by the European Central Bank, particularly the long-term refinancing operations that provide cheap financing for cash-starved banks, has shored up European banks. Fears that a crisis over sovereign debt might turn into a crisis over the viability of the euro have largely evaporated. The threat to the United States has diminished in turn, buoying economic confidence.
Despite those positive trends, the policy makers said the troubles in Europe would continue to depress American growth. The euro zone entered a period of economic contraction at the end of 2011. Countries like Spain are still struggling with the toxic combination of high borrowing costs, nonexistent growth and austerity budgeting.
That means fewer customers for American goods, less European investment in American markets and continued concerns about financial stability -- given that the euro area accounts for nearly one in every five dollars of global economic output, and the United States and the European Union account for about a third of global trade flows.
Even if Europe avoids financial catastrophe, it ''is still growing on average at very weak levels, and that will mean that growth in the United States is weaker than it otherwise would be,'' Mr. Geithner said.
But Mr. Bernanke tried to allay fear among members of Congress about American exposure to the crisis. American financial institutions have ''limited exposure'' to the euro zone's periphery, he said, but retain ''more material'' exposure to the bigger core countries, including France and Italy. Money market funds in the United States remain ''structurally vulnerable,'' Mr. Bernanke said, given that European holdings represent about one-third of their assets.
''You're comfortable today that there's no A.I.G. hiding in the woods?'' in the United States, asked Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California and the chairman of the committee, referring to the American insurer that received a multibillion-dollar bailout.
''We don't see any similar problem,'' said Mr. Bernanke, citing recent stress tests of American financial institutions.
Mr. Geithner maintained that the United States was in a ''much stronger position than the Continent as a whole.'' He cited the relative youth of the American work force and health and welfare provisions that are less costly than those in Europe. He also said that the United States had a better growth outlook than Europe because it had been ''much more aggressive'' in responding to its financial crisis.
Several lawmakers suggested that the United States could follow the path of unstable European countries like Greece because of its significant debt load.
Mr. Geithner said that there was ''no basis for comparison'' to Greece. Mr. Bernanke agreed, noting that Greece does not control its own currency and has a smaller and less diverse economy than the United States.
Mr. Bernanke also defended the role of the United States in aiding the Europeans. The Federal Reserve has been pumping dollars into the European financial system, now about $65 billion, to help combat the crisis. That has helped strengthen the European financial system and the global financial system, and improved confidence, he said.
He said he was confident there was virtually no risk the United States would lose money on those dollar liquidity swap lines. ''We're not taking any credit risk. We're not taking any foreign-exchange risk. The chances of losing any money are very low.''
He and Mr. Geithner emphasized that Europe needed to finish its 500 billion euro, or $661 billion, firewall -- a pool of cash to fight off any speculative attacks on weaker euro zone members -- to ensure that the crisis did not intensify again.
Recently, world leaders have expressed concern that the relative calm in the markets might reduce the urgency to complete a strong bailout mechanism for countries having trouble financing themselves on the debt markets, stabilizing heavily indebted countries and bolstering growth.
European leaders are close to adding more money to their firewall at the prodding of the I.M.F. and the United States, Group of 20 officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Mr. Geithner reiterated that there were no plans to ask Congress for more money for the I. M. F. and said Europe had the resources to end its crisis.

HEADLINE: Pushing Back Against Austerity

 BODY:
Political leaders across Europe have begun to push back against the campaign of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to put the Continent's economies into a straitjacket of unrelenting fiscal austerity. It is about time. Two years of insisting that weak economies carry out tax increases and spending cuts have brought nothing but recession and deepening indebtedness. 
The German-inspired fiscal compact that 25 heads of government agreed to in December will become binding in January provided at least 12 of the 17 countries using the euro ratify it this year. That process has barely begun. Before it goes any further, euro-zone members need to amend its inflexible, one-size-fits-all deficit ceilings. Failure to do so guarantees a longer, deeper European recession and would likely hurt America's nascent recovery.
In its present form, the fiscal compact requires all 17 euro-zone countries to bring their deficits down to between 0.5 percent and 1 percent of gross domestic product within a year of ratification or face fines and other penalties. Interim targets have already been set by European Union officials. Meeting those targets would require growth-killing new spending cuts and tax increases in some of Europe's weakest economies, like Spain, perversely pushing them even deeper into debt.
That is one big reason so many European leaders have now begun to resist the austerity-above-all approach. In Spain, calls for a more lenient 2012 target came from the new center-right government. In France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, they come from center-left opposition parties. This shift is less about ideology than about the message European voters across the political spectrum are now sending their leaders: They are fed up with austerity policies that have not worked. And they do not want their governments to renounce all fiscal tools for fighting recessions.
At Madrid's urging, European finance ministers last week agreed to raise Spain's deficit target for 2012 to 5.3 percent of domestic product from 4.4 percent. Spain is not the only country that needs relief. Ireland still hopes to meet its 2012 interim target of 8.6 percent but wants help reducing interest costs on the money it borrowed to bail out its banks. Even the Netherlands, long allied with Mrs. Merkel's austerity demands, now finds itself hard pressed to meet next year's 3 percent deficit requirement.
Treating each country as a special case would render the fiscal pact meaningless, reigniting the market speculation it was meant to calm. The right answer is a more flexible agreement, allowing all signatories to exceed deficit targets in periods of abnormally slow growth, provided they agree to market reforms and take steps to bring their long-term deficits under control.
Temporary easing of the targets need not lead to permanently larger deficits. If flexibility is linked to structural reforms like more open labor markets, lower pension costs and a more rational tax code, it can bring back the sustained growth needed for long-term balanced budgets. For center-left parties, it is politically easy to call flexible deficit targets. They could enlist broader political support for such flexibility if they also strongly embraced the more difficult labor market, pension and tax reforms.

HEADLINE: Obama Tours Four States To Defend Energy Policy

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
BOULDER CITY, Nev. -- Against the desert backdrop of the nation's largest solar energy installation, President Obama on Wednesday assailed Republican critics of his clean energy policies as ''the flat earth society'' even as he sought to demonstrate his own support for domestic oil and gas production.
Before Mr. Obama spoke at the solar plant southeast of Las Vegas, administration officials previewed an executive order that the president will announce on Thursday in Oklahoma to expedite federal permits for the southern half of the Keystone XL oil pipeline to the Gulf of Mexico. Republicans derided the move as a political stunt, intended only to blunt their criticism of Mr. Obama's decision in January to reject, on environmental grounds, a northern leg of the pipeline from Canada to Cushing, Okla. 
The partisan back and forth reflected the election-year stakes as Americans' disgust with high gasoline prices has chipped at Mr. Obama's approval ratings in polls and given Republicans a renewed sense of his vulnerability on pocketbook issues at a time when the economy otherwise has been improving.
The president's visits to Nevada and New Mexico on Wednesday opened a four-state trip over two days to highlight what he calls his ''all of the above'' agenda to foster alternative energy sources, as well as oil and gas, with federal tax and spending incentives.
''And, yes, that means we make investments in stuff that is new and we stop subsidizing stuff that's old,'' Mr. Obama told a small audience at the nation's largest solar energy installation, Sempra Energy's Copper Mountain Solar 1 Facility, which now provides power for 17,000 homes in California and is building additional acres of solar panels to create energy for 110,000 more, according to the company.
''The current members of the flat earth society in Congress, they would rather see us continue to provide $4 billion -- $4 billion -- in tax subsidies, tax giveaways, to the oil companies,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Every time you fill up at the pump, they're making money,'' he added.
Such language sets up a Senate vote, perhaps next week, on a Democratic proposal to repeal $2 billion in tax subsidies for the biggest oil companies and dedicate that sum to clean energy projects. But the measure is expected to fall short -- as similar proposals have -- as Democrats from energy-producing states join with the Senate's Republican minority against it.
The office of Speaker John A. Boehner released a statement dismissing Mr. Obama's energy trip as a ''tour de farce'' and recalling the much-publicized failure of another beneficiary of the administration's clean energy subsidies, the solar manufacturing firm Solyndra.
Mr. Obama anticipated such counterattacks in his remarks.
''Each successive generation recognizes that some technologies are going to work; some won't,'' he said. ''Some companies will fail; some companies will succeed.'' But, Mr. Obama added, ''I'm not going to give up on the new to cede our position to China or Germany or all the other competitors out there who are making massive investments in clean energy technology.''
In advance of Mr. Obama's remarks, the American Petroleum Institute released a letter to Mr. Obama from its president, Jack N. Gerard, taking issue with the administration's offensive.
''Pitting one energy source against another is a false choice which ignores the fact that we will need it all,'' Mr. Gerard wrote.
In arguments that Republicans have echoed, Mr. Gerard countered Mr. Obama's frequent claim that oil production in the United States is the highest in eight years, saying that production is up on private and state lands but down on federally owned land. Administration officials dispute that.
From Nevada, Mr. Obama flew to southeastern New Mexico to examine federal lands where 70 rigs are pumping oil.
He told a friendly audience there, ''You wouldn't know it from listening to some of these folks who are running for office -- I won't mention any names; you know who they are -- but producing more oil here in our own country has been, and will continue to be, a key part of our energy strategy. Under my administration, America is producing more oil today than at any time in the last eight years. That's a fact.''
Like Thursday's scheduled stop in Cushing, the president's itinerary is intended to show that he is not hostile to oil and gas production, as his opponents would have it. From Oklahoma, Mr. Obama will close his cross-country swing in Ohio, at an Ohio State University center for advanced energy research and development.
Most of Mr. Obama's stops are in election battleground states; this will be his second visit to Ohio in two weeks. So Oklahoma stands out: it was 50th among the states in support for Mr. Obama in 2008, with 66 percent of its vote going to John McCain. In the other three states, Crossroads GPS, a Republican ''super PAC,'' bought broadcast time for anti-Obama advertisements to offset coverage of his appearances.
Online Correction: March 21, 2012, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the day President Obama spoke at a community college about his energy policies. It was Thursday, not Friday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Exempts Some From Iran Oil Sanctions, but not India

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Discussions over lifting sanctions for India, China and South Korea continue. 

 BODY:
The Obama administration on Tuesday exempted Japan and 10 European nations from the prospect of biting sanctions intended to punish countries that continue to buy oil from Iran, but it left open the fate of other major importers, including China, India and South Korea, Steven Lee Myers writes in The New York Times. 
"At a time when Israel has threatened military action against Iran and Republicans have criticized the administration's approach," President Obama has argued that there is "still time to resolve international concerns about Iran's nuclear activities through diplomacy and increasingly punishing sanctions," Mr. Myers writes. 
 The latest set of sanctions - adopted with strong support in Congress despite objections from the administration - would stop American companies from doing business with any country that continues to buy Iranian oil through that country's Central Bank. The law, however, gives the administration significant room to maneuver to avoid a major disruption in the global oil market and any collateral damage to close American allies. 
China, India and South Korea, together with Japan, import more than 60 percent of Iran's oil, and negotiations with them continue. Under the law, Mr. Obama has until March 28 to waive the sanctions entirely on the grounds that the ban would disrupt the oil markets, a move now not considered likely, and by the end of June to exempt other countries.

HEADLINE: Groundwater Crisis Unfolds in Times Square

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Two digital billboards spanning 19,000 square feet depict surprising declines in groundwater around the world. 

 BODY:
To mark World Water Day, digital animations conveying the gravity of global declines in groundwater just went on display on two billboards in Times Square. The animations, based on satellite data provided by NASA and the University of California, Irvine, and statistics from the United States Geological Survey, will be shown several times each hour through April 22. 
The effort was organized by HeadsUp, an international competition challenging designers to create a visualization related to world water issues. (The winner was Richard Vijgen, an information designer in the Netherlands.)

The American intelligence community is warning that water shortages could destabilize countries in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia over the next decade, Steven Lee Myers reports. In a new assessment, it says that countries could use water as political and economic leverage over neighbors and that dams and desalination plants could become targets of terrorist attacks.

HEADLINE: How Far Would You Go for a Financial Comeback?

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A article looks at men who have left their families for lucrative work in the oil fields of North Dakota. 

 BODY:
How far would you go to pull yourself and your family back from the financial brink? That's the question I explored for an article that appears in the "Comeback Chronicles," in the special Your Money section on Thursday.
Many Americans have been forced to answer that question in the recent economic downturn. With jobs scarce and options few in their home states, many men -- and most of them are men -- found the answer hundreds and, in some cases, thousands of miles away from home, in the oil fields of western North Dakota.
Living in temporary "man camps" or, sometimes, in their cars, these men are spending extended time away from their families so they can send money back home, in a bid to get back on financial track. They say the sacrifice is worth it financially, although it can be a strain on relationships.
Many of the men I interviewed for the article on a visit in February to Williston, N.D., said they missed their families dearly, but saw no other option to make a decent living and get out of debt. Often, they had lost their homes -- or come close to it -- in the housing bust, and some had turned to borrowing from family members or their 401(k)s to make ends meet. The jobs in North Dakota often involve long hours in harsh weather, but they are a lifeline for these men and their loved ones, allowing them to earn good money and benefits that they hope will be the basis for a longer-term financial rebound.
Take a look at the article and let us know what you think in the comments section. Would you leave your family for weeks or months at a time, if it meant providing a better financial future for them?

HEADLINE: Greece's Sovereign Debt Lesson

BYLINE: STEPHEN J. LUBBEN


HIGHLIGHT: The credit default swaps auction may prove to be the last chapter for the Greek sovereign debt crisis. But sovereigns will undoubtedly default again. 

 BODY:
The credit default swapsauction on Monday drew a curtain on Act 1 of the Greek sovereign debt drama. 
Bondholders who want out, and who own the swaps, now have the chance to get paid a bit more than 70 percent of face for their bonds. If they are recent buyers of the debt, or were "naked" owners of the swaps, that's a pretty nice recovery. And anyone who has been a longer-term holder of Greek debt clearly suffered from excessive optimism. 
Hopefully, it will be the last chapter for Greece. And for Europe. But maybe not.
The end of this act of the drama has brought forth some odd efforts at writing the epilogue. Bill Gross of Pimco bemoaned the destruction of the "sanctity" of contracts. I trust he is not that naive.
Anyone who works with bonds knows that indentures will sometimes be broken. Indeed, no matter what the late Clark Byse taught me in 1L contracts class, a bankruptcy lawyer soon learns that the entire structure of the bankruptcy code is directed toward the idea that sometimes companies can't, or won't, honor the sanctity of their contracts. That's what covenants are for.
Of course, sovereign debt is a step further removed from bond indentures in general. A sovereign borrower always has the option to change the law that applies to its indenture, if the indenture is governed by the sovereign's own law -- or it simply refuses to pay and hides behind sovereign immunity.
A sovereign that borrows in its own currency doesn't even have to go this far, since printing more currency remains the more obvious option.
The Wall Street Journal recently ran an op-ed article by Alex J. Pollock of the American Enterprise Institute that reviewed the many historical examples of sovereigns that refused to pay their debts. The review has something of a surprise ending, however, since Mr. Pollock then argues that the only reason sovereign debt gets sold is because of governmental pressure on the banks.
Before we get all teary-eyed about JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank being forced to buy sovereign debt they don't really want, we might want to have a brief reality check.
First, nobody bought Greek debt because of government pressure, with the possible exception of some Greek banks. Everyone else bought Greek debt for the same reason individuals in the United States bought the debt of Lehman Brothers: they were chasing yield.
Moreover, in the case of financial institutions, there is an obvious element of regulatory arbitrage. The Basel accords have long treated all sovereigns that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development the same for capital purposes - so why buy boring old German or Canadian debt when you can buy Greek or Portuguese bonds that pay much more?
In short, the sanctity of contract was never much to begin with in times of financial distress, and sovereigns will undoubtedly default again. 
Bet on it.

HEADLINE: In Defense of Boomerang Kids

BYLINE: RANDYE HODER


HIGHLIGHT: Countless books, articles and blog posts have been written to advise parents how to coax their adult children out of the house. But why? 

 BODY:
Boomerang kids - those young adults who left the family home only to move back in because they can't make it on their own - have gotten a bad rap.
A recent study by the Pew Research Center found that the number of people between the ages of 25 and 34 living with their parents nearly doubled between 1980 and 2008. Tough economic times over the past few years have only hastened the trend. Of late, many have lamented the phenomenon, from an opinion piece in this newspaper dubbing Gen Y the "Go-Nowhere Generation" to a news article in The Times that lays some of the blame for the anemic economic recovery squarely on the boomerangers' shoulders. Countless books, stories and blog posts have also told parents how to best manage living with their adult children - or, better yet, how to coax them out the door.
But why? The Pew study showed that not only do the vast majority of boomerangers say these multigenerational living arrangements have been good for them, but their parents also seem quite pleased (perhaps because three-quarters of their adult children contribute to household expenses, and more than a third pay rent). In fact, parents whose children have moved back in with them are "just as satisfied with their family life and housing situation as are those parents whose adult children have not moved back home," according to Pew.
Still, despite the evidence, the pundits won't let up. "Today's generation is literally going nowhere," Todd Buchholz and Victoria Buchholz grumble in their New York Times op-ed. "This is the Occupy movement we should really be worried about."
I just don't get it. What's wrong with being a boomerang kid - or the parent of one?
A friend suggested to me that the trend flies in the face of Americans' spirit of independence. But I'm not so sure. It wasn't until after World War II that the extended family fell out of favor. Before that, we lived and worked together in multigenerational households because it made economic sense - just as it does now.
There are limits, of course. I'm not advocating that adult children move back in with their parents forever, taking advantage of the hot meals, laundry service and other amenities that living at home provides. Most of us would agree that the best indication of our success as parents is how well our adult children ultimately manage on their own.
But the truth is, parents who are in a position to help their children are generally happy to do so when asked. Meanwhile, most kids want to build an independent life, even if they require a helping hand every now and then.
I myself moved back in with my family in my mid-20's after being on my own for years. I needed a place to live while I completed my last year of college. My parents' largess allowed me to go on to graduate school and earn the degree that made it possible, in time, for me to leave home for good.
When my own children graduate from college and are ready for their first jobs, I hope they find them. And I hope they're able to make a successful transition to independence, finding their own places to live, paying their bills and learning to navigate the minutiae, frustrations and joys of everyday work and life. But if for any reason they need our help along the way, they will always be welcome to boomerang back home.

HEADLINE: How a Retired Couple's Portfolio Weathered the Recession

BYLINE: TARA SIEGEL BERNARD


HIGHLIGHT: The story of how one retired couple's portfolio weathered two recessions. Their portfolio lost about a quarter of its value during the Great Recession, but has come back since then because they stuck to their long-term investment plan. 

 BODY:
Back in 2008 and 2009, when the financial markets seemed as if they might tumble indefinitely, it took a lot of discipline to remain invested - particularly if you were retired or nearing retirement.
So be honest: How many of you managed to sit tight?
If your money was invested in a well-diversified portfolio like that of the Gochnours, a retired couple in their 70s from Boise, Idaho, it certainly paid off. We took a closer look at their strategy in an article in our special section, "The Comeback Chronicles."
The couple's portfolio, which is evenly divided between stock and bond funds, lost about 25 percent of its value in the big market plunge. But it has come back since then, and things could have turned out much worse had they not followed their son's investment mantra: Focus on the things you can control.
Their son, Mark Gochnour, is a mutual fund executive at Dimensional Fund Advisors, and he uses his parent's portfolio as the centerpiece of a presentation he gives to financial advisers from across the country. His parents' experience illustrates the merits of sticking with a smartly designed, long-term plan. Besides remaining well diversified, that also means keeping investment costs and taxes to a minimum, and remaining disciplined. In other words, don't be tempted to chase after whatever hot stocks are being promoted on television, and don't try to time the market.
How are your retirement savings invested? Were you confident enough in your long-term plan to remain invested during the market mayhem - and has your portfolio bounced back since then?

HEADLINE: With High Gas Prices, Buyers Shift Their Focus Downward

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: Analysts suggest American drivers move down market into smaller segments whenever they encounter sticker shock at the pump. 

 BODY:
The Toyota Prius C, with a combined E.P.A. fuel-economy rating of 50 miles per gallon, is in such demand that a dealer in Florida reportedly levied a $7,000 premium on the $19,710 vehicle, a scaled-down version of the class-leading hybrid. Toyota, which began sales of the C on March 12, moved more units in its first three days than either Chevrolet, with its plug-in-hybrid Volt, or Nissan, with its purely electric Leaf, managed in all of February.
The C's runaway popularity might be credited to rising gasoline prices and Toyota's improved quality and dependability. But analysts also identify a broader tendency among American consumers to move down market into smaller segments when they encounter sticker shock at the pump: from sport utility vehicles to crossovers; midsize to compact sedans; compact to subcompact hatchbacks.
Recent sales seem to bare both theories out. "Cars and crossovers, our most fuel-efficient vehicles, are now two thirds of our business," Jim Cain, a spokesman for General Motors, said in an interview. "The Sonic is doing fantastically well after a few months on the market," he added, referring to the new compact hatchback and sedan. The brand sold 7,900 Sonics last month, its best month. The Ford Focus, with 23,350 in sales, turned in its best February since 2000. Erich Merkle, a Ford sales analyst, said in an interview that the automaker was commanding its highest share of the small-car market in nearly a decade.
Shoppers can find any number of roomy midsize cars promising 30 highway m.p.g. or better, and as G.M. and Ford have shown, the midsize segment is booming, too.
"I absolutely think those results are a huge response to high gas prices," Lacey Plache, chief economist at Edmunds.com, said in an interview. "Historically, people's interest in compacts and hybrids just ratchets right up when fuel prices rise. The whole Prius line has had trouble keeping up with demand."
Mr. Merkle of Ford would not speculate on what gas prices would have to reach for consumers to move more quickly into smaller cars. "My best answer is that I don't know," he said. Still, many industry analysts say any price increase at the pump would have to be sustained to be meaningful.
"The small car results are a good sign of the acceptance of those vehicles, but if you're asking me if their sales will reach the magnitude of midsized cars, I'd say it's not likely soon," Christopher Hopson, a sales forecaster at IHS Automotive, said. "The sweet spot in the United States is midsize."
Small cars are also benefiting from high gas prices amid relatively optimistic economic indicators. He cautioned that the balance could be upset at any time. "Really high gas prices would hit the economy as a whole, and the last thing we'd worry about at that point is small car sales."

HEADLINE: A Tally of Green Jobs

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: In a report that could serve as ammunition for promoters or detractors of a greener economy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics fleshes out a sector that has been poorly defined. 

 BODY:
For the first time, the federal government on Thursday released an estimate of the number of so-called green jobs in the United States economy, saying that 3.1 million people are employed in the production of goods and services that benefit the environment.
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a unit of the Labor Department, spent more than a year compiling its report, which found that green goods and services accounted for 2.4 percent of total United States employment in 2010. The study, based on a survey of employers and a relatively broad definition of the term "green," will provide a baseline against which future job growth or decline can be measured.
 The definition and value of green jobs have been intensely debated for the last several years, as President Obama promised to create five million new environmentally friendly jobs. The administration has devoted tens of billions of dollars of federal stimulus money to projects intended to reduce energy use, clean up the environment and generate employment during the deep recession.
Republicans charge that the programs have largely been boondoggles, steering money to favored industries and companies while providing very few new jobs. They point to a number of companies, like the solar panel maker Solyndra, that defaulted on loans, laid off workers or otherwise failed to live up to their promises.

 The bureau's report will not resolve these conflicts, as it provides a snapshot of green employment for only one year, 2010, and its definition of green jobs - "jobs in businesses that produce goods and provide services that benefit the environment or conserve natural resources" - is broad enough to invite some controversy.
That includes the manufacture of energy-efficient appliances, batteries and wind turbines, workers at nuclear plants and hydroelectric dams, municipal bus drivers and trash collectors, and 65,050 workers in natural resources and mining, presumably those involved in cleaning up around oil rigs and coal mines.
The bulk of jobs - 2.3 million of the 3.1 million total - are in the private sector, with the greatest numbers in manufacturing, construction, transportation and waste services. The public sector had 860,000 green jobs in 2010, accounting for about 4 percent of public sector employment. Local government provided more than half of the public sector jobs, with the biggest sector being transportation and warehousing, including operators of mass transit systems.
 The numbers track fairly closely a study released last summer by the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, which calculated that 2.7 million Americans are employed in what it called the clean economy. Brookings found that clean industries employed more workers than the fossil fuels or bioscience industries do, but fewer than exist in information technology.
Mark Muro, a principal author of the Brookings study, said Thursday that the Bureau of Labor Statistics report provided firm numbers to a sector of the economy that until now has been poorly defined. 
 "The B.L.S. data does not include a sense of growth in the sector, but it provides a useful snapshot and reaffirms that this is a modest-sized, heavily manufacturing-oriented set of activities that can be measured," Mr. Muro said.
 He said the numbers would probably provide ammunition for both sides in the green jobs debate as well as a useful reality check against expectations and promises that, in retrospect, now appear to have been exaggerated and unrealistic.
 California had the highest number of green jobs, 338,400, representing 2.3 percent of the state's total employment. New York was next with 248,500, or 3 percent of total employment.
 Vermont had the highest percentage of environmentally friendly jobs, at 4.4 percent. The District of Columbia was second, at 3.9 percent.

HEADLINE: Deadline Nears for World Bank Nominees

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: Only one named candidate has emerged, but a United States choice - and possibly other aspirants - should be clear by Friday. 

 BODY:
The deadline for nominations to become president of the World Bank is 6 p.m. Friday. Thus far, the only named candidate is Jeffrey Sachs, the development economist and director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University. 
But that hardly means Mr. Sachs is a shoo-in. He has the support only of smaller developing countries, like Kenya. The big players have stayed on the sidelines until very close to the end, but expect a rush of candidates to come forward in the next 27 hours or so. 
The United States plans to name a qualified candidate who would immediately become the front-runner - Europe is expected to back the American nominee, giving the White House pick a hefty portion of the World Bank board's voting shares. 
Possible candidates include Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary and Obama economic adviser; Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the former White House economist (and an occasional contributor to this blog); Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations; and Indra K. Nooyi, the head of PepsiCo. (Speculation continues to swirl around Hillary Rodham Clinton, the secretary of state, and Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary. But they have been firmly ruled out.) 
Expect serious contenders from emerging-market countries as well. The biggest rumored names are Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Nigerian finance minister and former World Bank official, and Jos Antonio Ocampo, the former finance minister of Colombia and United Nations official. Both are highly respected and well known, with ample experience in development and economic policy making.

HEADLINE: The Outlook for Energy Independence

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The United States reduced oil imports from OPEC members by more than 20 percent in the last three years and it has become a net exporter of refined petroleum products. 

 BODY:
In an article in The Times, Clifford Krauss and Eric Lipton paint a broad-brush portrait of the expansion of oil production in the United States. Together, the increase in production and declines in gasoline consumption "have unexpectedly brought the United States markedly closer to a goal that has tantalized presidents since Richard Nixon: independence from foreign energy sources, a milestone that could reconfigure American foreign policy, the economy and more," they write.

HEADLINE: Do Women Like Child Care More Than Men?

BYLINE: TARA PARKER-POPE


HIGHLIGHT: On 16 out of 25 child-care tasks - like changing diapers, taking a child to the doctor or getting up in the middle of a night to attend to a child - women reported statistically significant higher levels of enjoyment than men. 

 BODY:
Once during a disagreement with my husband, I complained that he wasn't helping enough with our daughter, and I gave him a long list of the parenting chores I was shouldering on my own. "But you like doing all that stuff," he blurted in his defense. I don't recall how the conversation ended (probably badly), but I thought of it while reading a new study about the more mundane responsibilities of parenting. Researchers asked 181 heterosexual college professors who had children 2 or younger to rate, on a scale of 1 to 5, the pleasure they experienced from child care.
On 16 out of 25 child-care tasks - like changing diapers, taking a child to the doctor or getting up in the middle of a night to attend to a child - women reported statistically significant higher levels of enjoyment than men. The only parenting issue that gave women less pleasure than it gave men was having to manage who does what for the child. Over all, women's scores were 10 percent higher than men's.

Is it really true that women end up shouldering more of the parenting burden simply because they like it more - or at least dislike it less? Steven Rhoads, a University of Virginia political-science professor and the study's lead author, surmised that some women may have inflated their enjoyment scores because of feelings of guilt or cultural pressure. But he also said some research suggests that a woman's parenting skills are deeply rooted in biology. Women with high levels of testosterone, for instance, often show less interest in babies, while a father's testosterone levels are known to drop when a new baby arrives, ostensibly a biological mechanism to encourage bonding with the infant.
Women are also far more likely to take advantage of family-leave benefits to care for children. In the study, all the universities offered paid family leave, and 69 percent of the women took it, while only 12 percent of the men did. In Sweden, where family leave for both parents is particularly generous, men use about 20 percent of the 480-day benefit. Women use nearly all of it.
It's difficult to untangle how cultural and economic pressures or biological hard-wiring influence parenting. Plenty of men change diapers, and studies show that mothers and fathers alike spend more time with their children than they used to. Men have more than doubled the time they spend on child care since 1985. Yet women still spend twice as much time with the kids as men, says the University of Maryland sociologist John Robinson, who oversees the Americans' Use of Time project.
Notably in Rhoads's study, the two parenting activities that gave men the most pleasure (and women, too) were playing and talking with their kids. But when men were asked to rate how often they actually did those things, their scores were about 10 and 40 percent lower, respectively, than women's. In the end, perhaps the issue is not that mothers are overburdened by their children - my husband was right when he said I liked being a mom - but that men, for all their progress as fathers, are still missing out.

HIGHLIGHT: The assertion by Representative Paul D. Ryan and others that cutting taxes stimulates growth that offsets the lost revenue is largely unsupported by experience or evidence, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The United States is, without question, an exceptional country. No other nation has built so much wealth or attracted so many immigrants over the last 250 years. No other nation has demonstrated an equivalent track record for sustained innovation and productivity improvements. 
And no government has ever borrowed anywhere near as much as the federal debt outstanding in the United States today - which is likely to rise to about 73 percent of gross domestic product this year. (It stood at more than $10.8 trillion earlier this week, of which about half is held by foreigners; Treasury publishes debt numbers daily, to the penny.) 
This level of debt cannot be sustained indefinitely; under current policies, debt is projected to rise indefinitely and without limit as a share of the economy. Either the debt must be brought under control in a reasonable manner or our prosperity will face serious pressure.

In searching for a "reasonable" path for fiscal adjustment in the United States, should we plan on increasing or reducing tax revenue?
On Tuesday, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Budget Committee, released a budget that, he asserts, represents the right path to fiscal responsibility. One of Mr. Ryan's main ideas is to cut personal tax rates while also reducing corporate tax rates. 
This proposal has not yet been officially analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, but based on the available details and Mr. Ryan's own statements, federal government revenue would be likely to decline significantly relative to what it would be otherwise (perhaps $4.3 trillion over 10 years).
Is cutting revenue in the face of large budget deficits further evidence that Americans are an exceptional people, capable of doing things that elude others? Or does it represent another round of thinly disguised fiscal folly - the kind of thinking that has, in recent decades, undermined the exceptional degree of fiscal responsibility that made this nation great?
Mr. Ryan's plan looks closer to folly, for three reasons: 
First, the prevailing view among some on the right of the political spectrum is that our current deficit and debt levels are due primarily to runaway spending. It is true that the transition from budget surpluses at the end of the 1990s to deficits today did involve some significant increases in spending, some of it on two foreign wars and the prescription drug plan that was added to Medicare under President George W. Bush.
But mostly we eroded the revenue base of the federal government, through what are known as the "Bush tax cuts" of 2001 and 2003 (President Obama agreed to the extension of these in 2010). And then our runaway financial system came crashing down, producing the worst economic contraction since the 1930s. No country is capable of collecting much revenue in this kind of downturn.
Nothing in Mr. Ryan's plan addresses the way revenue has declined - or proposes to make it more stable. There is no mention, for example, of the way financial-sector risks create huge contingent liabilities for the federal government. On the contrary, Mr. Ryan wants to make the Bush tax cuts permanent - and do more of the same.
Second, Mr. Ryan resists the notion that his proposals will reduce revenue, contending that they will cause economic growth to accelerate - and as he said in his Wall Street Journal commentary on Tuesday, "The faster the economy grows, the more revenue the government will have to meet its priorities and start paying down the debt."
The same arguments were made about the Bush tax cuts and, as far back as the early 1980s, for the original Reagan tax cuts. Unfortunately, all such assertions in recent American history have proved greatly exaggerated.
Reagan had to undo some of his tax cuts precisely because revenue fell too much - and by the mid-1980s there were legitimate fears, articulated by the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul A. Volcker, and Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, among others, that the budget deficit would spin out of control. 
Twenty-five years ago, a strong bloc of Republicans cared a great deal about controlling the deficit - and recognized that a robust tax base was essential to fiscal prudence.
Third, Mr. Ryan promises to reduce government spending - and suggests that his plans to do so will more than match any revenue lost from tax cuts. These include big cuts to Medicaid and Head Start, among other programs, as well as much of the investment in education and infrastructure (although not military spending, apparently). 
Yet those items are small relative to total federal government spending, most of which goes for the military, Social Security and Medicare.
The magic spending reductions for Mr. Ryan are in Medicare. But this is magic that is unproven and unlikely to exist.
Mr. Ryan's proposals for pushing Medicare off the federal budget were evaluated last year by the Congressional Budget Office as likely to increase health care spending as a percentage of G.D.P. (His plan this year is a modification of last year's variant, and the changes are small, so it is likely to be scored on a similar basis.)
In the view of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the total health care costs for American families and businesses would increase - not decrease - as a result of taking government out of the business of paying for health care. 
The government is a big buyer and has some market power - although this could be used more aggressively - families and companies have little leverage on pricing, and it shows. (Disclosure: I'm on the C.B.O.'s Panel of Economic Advisers, but I'm not involved in any of its budget analysis or how it scores Medicare reform proposals.)
In sum, Mr. Ryan's budget would reduce taxes, particularly for relatively well-off people. It would cut spending - mostly by shifting health care costs onto the private sector, which is the last thing that entrepreneurs and larger companies need. Health care spending as a percentage of the economy - what it costs us to stay healthy - would increase over time, compared with what would happen under the current system.
The Ryan budget is also likely to increase the deficit and the debt, probably by far more than he has projected. 
By front-loading tax cuts and promising spending cuts down the road - his Medicare changes would not take place until 2023 - Mr. Ryan is actually relying on the ability of the federal government to borrow heavily for the indefinite future. His proponents will resist this notion vigorously, but James Kwak and I have demonstrated in our recent work the history and public policy thinking that brought us to this point. Recent "tax-cutting" ideas have consistently undermined our fiscal health.
The ability of the United States to borrow reflects its collective strength. After a difficult struggle to establish viable public finances during and immediately after the War of Independence, the United States finally found its fiscal footing. The bicentennial of the real turning point is this year - it was the War of 1812 that finally created a political consensus for fiscal prudence, including agreement on the need to pay, with taxes, for what the government spends. The United States earned the hard way and long deserved its reputation for fiscal prudence.
Its ability to borrow today creates what can be an advantage. When the economy turns down sharply - for example, because some big banks blew themselves up - it is much better to avoid being forced into fiscal austerity. Ask the Europeans.
But our willingness to borrow has also become a weakness. We need to bring the deficit and our national debt under control. In large part we should restore revenues to where they were in the mid-1990s, before the rash move to lower tax rates in the mistaken belief that there was a budget surplus to distribute. 
As essential first step is for the president and Congress to refuse to extend the Bush-era tax cuts when they expire at the end of this year.

HEADLINE: Watson Nears $6.6 Billion Deal for Actavis

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Watson Pharmaceuticals is expected to bid as much as 5 billion euros ($6.6 billion) for the Swiss drug maker Actavis Group in a deal that would create one of the world's largest generic drug manufacturers. 

 BODY:
Watson Pharmaceuticals is expected to bid as much as 5 billion euros ($6.6 billion) for the Swiss drug maker Actavis Group in a deal that would create one of the world's largest generic drug manufacturers, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.
The acquisition would help bolster Watson's international presence. While both companies have operations in the United States, Actavis has a larger share of generic drug manufacturing overseas, particularly in Eastern Europe.
"A deal of Actavis would solve all their issues in the rest of Europe and other parts in the world," said one person briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. "An approach by Watson would be a perfect fit for Actavis."
The people cautioned that talks were continuing and could still fall apart. The news of the deal was earlier reported by Reuters.
A deal would also represent a win for Deutsche Bank, which remains Actavis's largest creditor after it financed the $5 billion leveraged buyout of the Swiss generic drug maker by the Icelandic billionaire Bjorgolfur Thor Bjorgolfsson in 2007. 
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, Actavis has been bogged down by the high cost of its debt. The situation has put pressure on Deutsche Bank, which in its fourth quarter reported a 407 million euro impairment charge related to Actavis.
By finding a potential buyer for the Swiss company, the bank's new incoming chief executives, including Anshu Jain, the current head of its investment banking unit, would be able to offload Actavis's debts.
"It would be a perfect start for Jain if he's able to solve the issues surrounding Actavis," said a person with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.
Watson is the only company so far to have approached the Swiss drug maker about a potential takeover, but other firms could enter the fray over the coming weeks, the person added.
The proposed takeover of Actavis is the latest in a number of mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceuticals industry. 
Last year, drug companies announced $98.6 billion of deals, including Watson's $562 million acquisition of Specifar Pharmaceuticals of Greece. That volume represents a 46.5 percent increase from the previous year, according to the data provider Dealogic.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Etch a Sketch

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
With an endorsement in hand from former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, Mitt Romney is seeking to rally the Republican establishment around what his campaign sees as his inevitable nomination so he can get on with the task of challenging President Obama, Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg write. But even as Mr. Romney tried on Wednesday to parlay the endorsement from Mr. Bush into wider gains, a campaign aide made a remark that turned into a major distraction, comparing the campaign's pivot from the primary campaign to the general election to an Etch a Sketch.
Like Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum sees his fight for the White House as a crucial moment in American history, on par with the American Revolution or the Civil War. Sarah Wheaton explains that Mr. Santorum portrays the difference between him and Mr. Obama as a choice between a candidate who can save the nation and its future (him) and a president working in tandem with the forces seeking to destroy the country in the chokehold of expansive government (Mr. Obama).
President Obama, on an blitz tour of energy-producing states, defended himself as a supporter of domestic energy production as his administration announced plans to speed construction of a segment of oil pipeline that would run from Oklahoma to the Gulf of Mexico. Jackie Calmes writes that the president's move was the latest in a partisan back and forth that reflected the election-year stakes for President Obama and his Republican detractors as Americans face higher prices at the gas pump.
The Senateput off voting on the JOBS bill again on Wednesday, Edward Wyatt reports. The bill, a measure that would make it easier for companies to raise capital from private investors, is expected to come up for a vote again on Thursday.
Happening in Washington:
Economic reports scheduled for release on Thursday include weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. At 10, expect leading indicators for February, the home price index for January, and weekly mortgage rates.
At 9:30 a.m., Gen. John Allen, the top commander of American and NATO troops in Afghanistan, testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee.
At 12:45 p.m., Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, will give the second lecture in a four-part series about the Federal Reserve and the financial crisis that emerged in 2007.

HEADLINE: Romney Campaign Gaffe Steps on Good News, Again

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The Etch A Sketch moment on Wednesday was a reminder that Mitt Romney and his team have made several notable and ill-timed stumbles during the primary season. 

 BODY:
If Mitt Romney's Etch A Sketch moment on Wednesday taught his campaign anything, it's probably this: There is little room for missteps.
Assuming that Mitt Romney makes it through the Republican primary to face President Obama in the fall, he will be facing a campaign operation that knows just how to pounce, fiercely and with little hesitation.
That's exactly what the Democratic National Committee and Mr. Obama's liberal allies did on Wednesday morning when Eric Fehrnstrom, one of Mr. Romney's top aides, likened the next phase of his campaign to the Etch a Sketch drawing toy.
Within minutes, the Democratic attack machine roared to life, using the otherwise silly moment to drive home a dead-serious message: that Mr. Romney's beliefs are no more permanent than the easily erased images on an Etch A Sketch.
By noon it was clear that Mr. Romney's campaign had handed his rivals (Republican and Democratic) an all-consuming, daylong issue. Mr. Romney conceded as much by holding a one-question news conference at the end of the day to try to clean up the mess.
The Etch A Sketch frenzy is likely to fade quickly. It was, after all, a comment made by an aide, not by Mr. Romney himself. And the presidential election in 2012 is about fundamentally big things - the economy, war in Afghanistan and Iraq, jobs, Iranian nuclear ambitions, Chinese competition.
But for a campaign run by highly disciplined operatives steeped in the art of opposition research, Mr. Romney's team has made a remarkable number of stumbles during the primary season.
Over and over again, Mr. Romney has found a way to rob himself of a good news cycle, usually by saying something that feeds the least flattering narratives about him.
On the eve of the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Romney tried to explain his support for the free market in health care by saying, "I like being able to fire people who provide services to me." The comment was played again and again, fueled by Democrats who happily took it out of the broader context of his comments.
The day after Mr. Romney won Florida's primary - a day that should have been all about his comeback victory over Newt Gingrich after losing South Carolina - Mr. Romney said in a CNN interview,"I'm not concerned about the very poor."
Campaign aides pointed out that he had said similar things many times before, and that he was trying to demonstrate his focus on the middle class. But it did no good, and his Florida victory had to share billing with his comments about the poor.
A day after stumbling over a question about his taxes in the first South Carolina debate, Mr. Romney added to his woes by suggesting that the $374,000 he earned in speaking fees was "not very much" money.
And in the days leading up to the Michigan primary - a contest that should have been one of the easiest for him - Mr. Romney provided a series of too-easy targets for his critics. Odd remarks about the height of trees and the width of streets in Michigan was followed up by an acknowledgement that his wife, Ann, drove"a couple of Cadillacs."
Mr. Fehrnstrom's Etch A Sketch comment was the latest example. It was made first thing Wednesday morning, just as Mr. Romney and his aides anticipated basking in the glow of a double-digit win in Illinois. It also competed with the surprise endorsement of Mr. Romney by Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor.
Mr. Romney's aides argue that such moments are ephemeral and do no lasting damage to their candidate, who, they say, is focused on what people really care about: the economy, jobs and defeating Mr. Obama.
They may be right. But one thing is certain: The people who run Mr. Obama's campaign are unlikely to let any gaffe - no matter how small - pass by unnoticed during the president's re-election campaign.
And they will be aided in the coming months by liberal allies who are literally tracking every word Mr. Romney and his associates say. The idea behind groups like American Bridge 21st Centuryand others is to catch the Republicans in misstatements, flip-flops, embarrassing moments and gaffes.
If the Etch A Sketch moment is any indication, Mr. Obama's team has a hair trigger when it comes to seizing on a communications mishap. Mr. Romney will have to avoid them in the fall - if he can.

On Wall St., Keeping a Tight Rein on Twitter | Wall Street firms are tiptoeing into the fast-paced world of social media, with special software to archive messages and oversee postings.
Firms like Morgan Stanley must tightly monitor communications to ensure that they are in compliance with securities regulations. As a result, they generally block employees from using social media sites like Twitter or even checking personal e-mail accounts at work. Indeed, the banks underwriting the gigantic Facebook I.P.O. bar their employees from using the social networking site.
Yet for Wall Street, social media constitute a largely untapped marketing opportunity. So a cottage industry has emerged. Adept start-ups act as guides on Wall Street's social media adventure, providing the software that helps firms comply with regulations that date to a sleepier era of communication.

HEADLINE: The Etch A Sketch Doctrine

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: David Brooks and Gail Collins take the latest campaign news, shake it up and down and see what's still there. 

 BODY:
Gail Collins: David, Mitt Romney won big in Illinois. Does this mean we don't have to talk about Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich anymore? I have to admit I'm getting pretty tired of them.
David: Hey, it beats vice president speculation - the game of who Romney is going to pick. Nothing is more boring than that. By the way, it's not going to be Marco Rubio. The conventional view among party elders is that he's very talented but not quite ready.
Gail: I'm not normally the sort of person who whines about how the candidates are just engaging in sensational personal attacks and failing to talk about the issues. Normally, there's nothing I like more than sensational personal attacks. But the Republican primaries have been sort of ridiculous on that front.
David: I'm wondering how much Romney will be able to pivot and leave that whole mess behind. Everybody is upset that Romney's longtime aide Eric Fehrnstrom compared the primary season to an Etch A Sketch - you can shake it and start anew. But that gave me hope that Team Romney is thinking about a re-launch, which is what they need.
Gail: You always did say you preferred Romney because you thought he'd mutate into a totally different person after the primaries. I will now think of it as the David Brooks Etch A Sketch theory.
David: Although, I never found Etch A Sketch as cool as Spirograph, let alone electric football, the all-time best game of my youth.
Gail: Do you think that once Rick Santorum goes away, the whole war on women thing will disappear? I'd actually be kind of disappointed. I think we've been approaching a healthy national discussion of what freedom of religion really means in a country that's acquiring more and more religions all the time. And where our shared national respect for human life ends and theological debates about whether fertilized eggs have a soul begin.
David: I think Santorum is leader of the conservatives now by default, but he will not have a major role on the right after the campaign is over, the way, say, Palin did after the last election. He's restored his reputation with his primary strength, but there are many other rising conservatives who will capture the imagination of the faithful.
On issues like when fertilized eggs have a soul, my impression is that Mitch Daniels was right on that one. The country wants a truce on that so we can focus on other things. Whichever party raises the issue in people's minds will suffer because many voters just don't want to think about it.
Gail: While it's impossible to tell what Romney really believes about almost anything, I do think that when it comes to matters of women and reproduction, his instinct is to keep the government out of it. However, he's jumped around on this so much, he always comes out looking bad. You can't woo Planned Parenthood when you run for the Senate and then promise to put it out of business when you run for president. That story about how he didn't know what an embryo was until he became governor isn't going to fly.
David: Somehow in my gut I think he's actually where he was when he ran in Massachusetts. But his private views, if any, don't matter. If elected president he will avoid socially divisive issues (as Reagan and the Bushes did when possible) but stay true to the Republican line when necessary. Both Democratic and Republican politicians have found the formula. The party bases will forgive a lot of deviationism on economic issues so long as they are rock solid on social issues, affirmative action and the identity politics issues.
Gail: What's your bet on the gender gap this fall?
David: I'll go with 5 points, significantly down from where it is now. I think once Santorum and Gingrich are out of the limelight, Romney's ratings on that front will recover a bit. Ann Romney will help.
Gail: My biggest rule on women voters is that most of them won't, under any circumstances, support a male candidate who yells a lot. Which would have been a real problem for Santorum and Gingrich. Romney's not a yeller. In fact he reminds me of the guy in high school who was head of the Courtesy Club and danced with the unpopular girls at mixers. However, over the past few months, he's been a guy the unpopular girls at the mixer would have hidden in the bathroom to avoid.
David: I know it's been a bad spell for him, but I keep hearing wonderful stories about Romney. One finance guy in Boston recently told me about the time the 14-year-old daughter of one of the Bain partners was kidnapped after a rave party. Romney shut down the firm, flew everybody to New York and they scoured the city looking for and publicizing her plight. The girl's father credits Romney with saving her life. Those stories seem to surface about Romney periodically, leading me to believe he's a good man caught in a horrible campaign.
Gail: The typical woman voter has been transformed over the last few generations, just like the typical American woman. It used to be that a candidate campaigned for the women's vote by proving he was a good husband. Now, women want to feel that the commander in chief is used to working with women in every area of his life and that there would be lots of them in major places in his administration.
While I've seen endless evidence that Romney is devoted to his wife, he doesn't seem to have much history in working with women in the non-domestic world. Those famous pictures of the Bain founders with dollar bills sticking out of their collars and ears look like a fraternity party.
David: It's true those pictures are pretty frattish. I don't know much about the inner world of Bain, but not long ago a woman who worked with Romney when he was governor raved to me about his management skills. She was as amazed at his current political positioning, but she said he was a remarkable executive. She's a Democrat so probably wouldn't go public with such talk, but I was impressed.
Gail: Well, it's on to - what? It'd be nice if poor New York got a chance to have a say in our presidential primary at the end of April, but I don't know if I can stand another month of pretending that this is still a contest. Although I'll miss all that speculation about a brokered convention. We could have had fun at a brokered convention, David. Conversations every day.
David: A brokered Tea Party-dominated convention might have been tricky for us. With passions high and the vital juices flowing, first they go after Romney. Then they go after columnists from The Times.

HEADLINE: Structure, Not Numbers

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: How to judge (and not to judge) the Paul Ryan budget. 

 BODY:
When Paul Ryan and the House Republicans released their budget proposal last year, most of the criticisms from liberals focused on the budget's sweeping and controversial Medicare overhaul. In this year's budget, the Medicare reforms have been amended in ways that address at least some of last year's critiques, and so the smartest liberal commentary (see, for instance, Ezra Klein and Jonathan Cohn) is focusing instead on everywhere else that the Republican budget envisions reducing spending - slowing Medicaid growth, rolling back Obamacare, keeping discretionary spending nearly flat, etc. - and how implausible, irresponsible and cruel these cuts would inevitably be.
Let me suggest a slightly different way to look at it. The one thing that our political system has proven incapable of doing, lo these many years, is actually following through on spending cuts of any scope or magnitude. This has been true under Republicans as well as Democrats: Specific programs are occasionally reduced or repealed, but the trend in almost every category of spending is inexorably upward, toward heights that almost everyone agrees are unsustainable. What's more, no present Congress can really bind the hands of future Congresses on spending (even a balanced budget amendment would probably be worked around in various ways), so a legislative promise to spend X dollars less on program Y at future date Z is pretty much meaningless except as a statement of principle. A Republican-led, Tea Party-influenced Congress might succeed in hewing to the Ryan blueprint for a year or two, but absent significant changes in the way our domestic programs work, everything we know about American politics suggests that the decades-out dollar projections in the budget shouldn't be taken seriously.
In this sense, liberals are right to highlight their implausibility - but wrong to argue that they discredit the Ryan budget as a policy document. The highly specific projections are important to the document's claim (aimed mainly at skeptical right-wingers, not outraged liberals) to be a surefire budget-balancing document. But they're largely irrelevant to its real policy purpose, which is to make structural changes to existing programs in the hopes of changing the underlying incentives that are driving spending growth and hampering economic expansion. Thus the projected dollar figures for Medicaid spending in 2021 or 2031 matter less than the budget's proposal to devolve control over Medicaid to state governments and allow more room for policy experimentation at that level. The projected growth rates for Medicare spending matter less than the shift to a defined contribution plan, the introduction of competitive bidding, and so on. And the biggest problem with the Ryan budget is that its structural reforms probably don't go far enough - in the case of tax reform because the more controversial details haven't been filled in, and in the case of health care reform because Congressional Republicans as a group are still wary of embracing substantial changes to the existing working-age system, preferring to just posture against Obamacare instead.
A liberal interlocutor might respond that even if the structural proposals are where the action really is, the implausibility of the specific spending cuts is worth highlighting anyway, because doing so makes the case for the higher tax rates that the left insists are necessary. That's fair enough, but then it's equally fair to point out that to the extent that a liberal version of the Ryan plan exists (which it does only implicitly, because the Obama White House prefers to be considerably more evasive about its policy preferences), it has the same problem in reverse: It requires punishing tax increases that would be as politically toxic as many of the specific cuts that the Ryan budget envisions. In other words, given what we know about American politics and political economy, side's current answers are anything but implausible; Ryan is just more willing to be upfront about what his numbers would actually look like. Which in turn heightens the importance (again) of structural changes that could bring us back toward a healthy equilibrium where more modest spending cuts and more modest tax increases, cushioned by steadier economic growth, would be sufficient to keep our fisc in balance.
Or to put it another way: Even if Paul Ryan's Medicare and Medicaid reforms turn out to be effective ways of saving money, they probably won't obviate the need for future grand bargains on taxes and spending. But those bargains could be much, much easier to strike if his structural reforms are allowed to work their way through the system first - and if they're joined by other systematic reforms as well.

HEADLINE: A Sliver of a Silver Lining for the Movie Industry

BYLINE: BROOKS BARNES


HIGHLIGHT: The Motion Picture Association of America, releasing some figures for 2011, pointed to an increase in global ticket sales. But revenue in North America dropped compared with 2010, and the number of films produced declined substantially. 

 BODY:
The Motion Picture Association of America, releasing its annual snapshot of global moviegoer trends on Thursday, looked on the bright side, as its job requires.
Global ticket sales for 2011 climbed 3 percent, to $32.6 billion, compared with a year earlier, driven by increases in China, Russia, Mexico and Brazil. As for North America, well, the association would like to focus on the fact that domestic box office revenues of $10.2 billion were 6 percent higher than five years earlier.
The picture darkens from there.
Year-on-year revenue in North America fell 4 percent overall on a 4.5 percent drop in admissions, to 1.28 billion, the lowest in at least a decade. Revenue from 3-D movies in North America fell 18 percent, partly because it suffered in comparison to 2011, which included unprecedented sales from "Avatar." Ticket prices climbed 1 percent, to $7.93.
Hispanic moviegoers - Hollywood's most loyal audience based on per capita attendance - went to the movies an average of 5 times last year, down from an average of 7 times a year earlier. (The motion picture organization said the study's sample size may be to blame.)
The number of films produced in 2011 by Hollywood's six major studios - Disney, Paramount, Sony, 20th Century Fox, Universal and Warner - declined 18 percent, to 97; that's a 30 percent decline from 2007. (The M.P.A.A. noted that a higher production rate of smaller movies, whose budgets range from a few thousand dollars to $20 million, helped fill the gap.)
The annual Theatrical Statistics Summary did not include data on the costs of marketing movies; the M.P.A.A. dropped that accounting a few years ago, partly because studios were embarrassed by how much they were spending.
"These numbers underscore the impact of movies on the global economy and the vitality of the film-watching experience around the world," said Christopher J. Dodd, the former United States senator who is the motion picture association's chairman. John Fithian, president of the National Association of Theater Owners, called attention to this year, which is off to a much stronger start than 2011.
"Let's see what 2012 brings," Mr. Fithian said. "My guess is that we're going to see a substantial increase this year."

HEADLINE: To Stop Iran, the G.O.P. Should Back Obama

BYLINE: MARK DUBOWITZ


HIGHLIGHT: To prevent a nuclear Iran, Republicans should do the unthinkable: get behind Obama and double down on sanctions. 

 BODY:
These days, Republicans are seizing every opportunity to hammer President Obama for both high gas prices and his Iran policy.
Mitt Romney recently criticized him, arguing that, when it came to Iran, Obama "not only dawdled in imposing crippling sanctions, he's opposed them."
Rick Santorum called Obama's Iran policy a "colossal failure," and blamed high gas prices on a "radical environmental movement in this country" that has failed to make America "energy independent" from the Middle East.
While it's reasonable to disagree with his administration's domestic energy policies, Republican candidates should acknowledge the obvious trade-off on Iran: Such sanctions would drive gas prices up by reducing the global oil supply. (Even Saudi Arabia's spare production capacity is not enough to replace all of Iran's daily sales of 2.2 million barrels without causing a major price spike.)
Republican candidates have boxed Obama in. Their dual line of attack might be smart politics, but it's not smart policy. Either gas prices go down or Obama imposes suffocating sanctions on Iranian oil exports. They can't have it both ways.
The only way to avoid that trap is to extend the carefully crafted oil sanctions policy that Congress passed in December with overwhelming bipartisan support - a policy which the administration is now enthusiastically implementing after initially rejecting it.
If the Republican candidates want to exert their influence to stop Iran's drive toward a nuclear weapon, and keep oil-market anxiety to a minimum, they'll need to do the unthinkable in an election season: support Obama by quietly doubling down on the administration's current oil-market sanctions while continuing to ask tough questions about his broader Iran policy.
Oil-market sanctions against Iran are risky. World oil prices are up by 15 percent in 2012 due to tight supplies and growing demand, and $5 gas on Election Day is a real possibility that could threaten the nascent economic recovery.
But oil markets are also skittish that Obama might grow too aggressive in enforcing oil sanctions, or that Israel will lose patience with sanctions and attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Either scenario could send oil prices skyrocketing.
In response, the Obama administration has tried to perform a delicate balancing act: to dramatically reduce Iran's oil revenues while trying to reassure anxious markets that it will still let some Iranian crude flow.
On Tuesday, the administration took an important step toward implementing that idea. It granted Japan an exception to American sanctions based on evidence that Tokyo had reduced its Iranian crude purchases by about 20 percent since 2011. (It also exempted 10 European countries, which will soon be subject to an oil embargo imposed by the European Union.) At the same time, the administration has made clear that it will only let other countries buy Iranian oil if they "significantly reduce" their overall purchases.
For the first time since Iraq invaded Iran in 1980, Iranian oil revenues are seriously threatened. According to the Department of Energy, Iran's crude oil sales account for 80 percent of its hard-currency export earnings and 50 percent of its overall government budget. Existing sanctions on Iran have already caused the black-market value of the Iranian rial to plummet by more than 50 percent in a matter of months.
The International Energy Agency projects that, when the European embargo on Iranian oil goes into effect in July, Iran's oil sales could drop by 50 percent, to levels not seen since the Iran-Iraq war. That would certainly get the attention of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
And Republicans can push President Obama further. They should call on him to take a bold step and declare the entire Iranian energy sector a "zone of primary proliferation concern," with which no legitimate international firm should do business.
There is a precedent: United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929, passed in 2010 with the support of Russia and China, explicitly notes a "potential connection" between Iranian oil and gas revenues and "the funding of its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities."
In 2011, the Obama administration declared Iran's entire financial sector a money-laundering threat, laying the groundwork for sanctions against Iran's central bank.
Blacklisting Iran's entire energy sector would reduce the number of companies willing to trade in Iranian oil and natural gas, thus forcing Iran to reduce its prices for whatever it can still sell.
Republicans may not like it, but President Obama should also grant China a formal exception to the sanctions, allowing it to buy as much Iranian oil as it wants so long as it continues to extract major price discounts, which reportedly are now around $20 per barrel. Chinese oil traders could be counted on to push ruthlessly for these discounts. That's about as responsible a stakeholder as Beijing will ever be when it comes to sanctioning Iran.
This approach would calm markets by permitting some Iranian oil to flow, while turning the rest into a distressed asset. It's a win-win scenario; it doesn't reduce the amount of oil available on world markets but it denies Iran's leaders the revenue they badly need.
To calm nervous allies, America should also grant an exemption from sanctions to refineries, shippers and traders from countries that the administration has permitted to keep buying Iranian oil. (That exemption is currently only granted to those countries' financial institutions.)
If aggressively enforced, these sanctions would discourage most foreign companies from investing in Iran's energy sector, or having any other dealings with Iranian energy companies, further shrinking Iranian oil and natural gas production and providing the remaining foreign companies with greater leverage to extract major price concessions from Tehran.
This policy should attract significant bipartisan support in the House and Senate. And if Obama pursues it, Congress will likely be forced to have his back since they have already demanded tougher sanctions.
We are fast approaching a point when sanctions will no longer be able to stop Iran's nuclear weapons program. As tempting as it may be, Republican candidates should set aside the opportunity to score quick political points and support the president in taking a bold step on sanctions that could destroy Iran's oil wealth. And if Ayatollah Khamenei still refuses to compromise, Republicans and Democrats may find themselves more united in moving beyond sanctions and pursuing a military option.

HEADLINE: Chronicling Americans' Comeback From the Great Recession

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A special Your Money section, "The Comeback Chronicles," describes how Americans are fighting to regain a financial foothold. 

 BODY:
The Great Recession has officially been over since June 2009, but a slow recovery and lingering unemployment continue to pose challenges for many Americans. On Thursday, the crew of Your Money told some of these stories from around the country in a special section, "The Comeback Chronicles."
You'll read about family menwho have struck out for the oil fields of Williston, N.D., in search of a steady income to help get their finances back on track. Many have left loved ones hundreds of miles away, while they make their homes in temporary "man camps." Elsewhere, men have responded by switching to jobs, like nursing, that have traditionally been dominated by women. 
Farther south, an Atlanta woman describes how she gambled on buying a home out of foreclosure, and has seen her risk pay off. 
A Boston-area grandmother, meanwhile, describes how a nonprofit group helped her keep her homewhen she came perilously close to losing it. A general contractor in Connecticut tells how he is having to adjust to smaller jobs. And a Texas widow details how she was forced to get a job and rebuild her life, after losing her entire savings in the Ponzi scheme orchestrated by R. Allen Stanford.
The section also includes a full page of charts, showing where the comeback has taken hold and where it still has a way to go.
The section is a collaboration with American Public Media's "Marketplace Money" radio program, and its broadcast this weekend will feature some of the people profiled. See the Marketplace MoneyWeb site for station information.
We hope you enjoy the stories, and urge you to share your own comeback stories in the comment section below.

HEADLINE: A.I.G. Repays Additional $1.5 Billion to Government

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The American International Group said on Thursday that it had repaid an additional $1.5 billion owed to the Treasury Department, further reducing the bailed-out insurer's government lifeline. 

 BODY:
The American International Group said on Thursday that it had repaid an additional $1.5 billion owed to the Treasury Department, further reducing the bailed-out insurer's government lifeline.
Under the terms of this latest agreement, A.I.G. paid off preferred shares that the government owned in a special entity that holds shares in the AIA Group, an Asian insurer spun off in the fall of 2010.
A.I.G. made the repayment a year ahead of schedule.
After this repayment, the federal government's remaining investment in A.I.G. stands at about $45 billion, after providing the insurer with a bailout worth as much as $182 billion during the depths of the financial crisis. 
"In the dark days of the financial crisis, when commitments to A.I.G. totaled $182 billion, few would have believed that we'd already be able to reduce that amount by more than 75 percent, or that we may be able to recover every single dollar invested in the company," Tim Massad, the Treasury Department's assistant secretary for financial stability, said in a statement. "This demonstrates the significant progress that A.I.G. and the government have made in restructuring the company's business so that it can repay taxpayers."
The Treasury Department still owns a 70 percent stake in the insurer, worth about $35 billion as of Thursday's closing price. And the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is still owed $9 billion, through a loan to a special entity that holds mortgage-related securities once owned by A.I.G.
Earlier this month, the Treasury Department sold $6 billion worth of A.I.G. common shares. The insurer also agreed to repay $8.6 billion in other obligations to the government, in large part through proceeds from various asset sales.

HEADLINE: Ex-Official For Housing Set to Admit Corruption

BYLINE: By MOSI SECRET

 BODY:
A former senior official at the New York City agency that helps build affordable housing is expected to plead guilty on Friday to charges related to accepting $600,000 in bribes and kickbacks. 
The official, Wendell B. Walters, a onetime assistant commissioner at the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, was arrested in October on racketeering charges; he was accused of taking money from developers involved in building about $22 million in moderately priced housing overseen by the agency in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens since 2002.
Prosecutors said Mr. Walters, 49, steered contracts to the developers in exchange for the cash, which he pocketed at meetings around the city, including at a golf driving range and at a parking lot. Developers and contractors involved in the scheme then passed the cost of the kickbacks and bribes on to the city with inflated invoices, the authorities said.
Mr. Walters was charged with racketeering conspiracy, extortion, bribery, wire fraud and money laundering. He is expected to plead guilty in Federal District Court in Brooklyn before Judge Nina Gershon. It is not clear if Mr. Walters will plead guilty to reduced charges.
Six developers, two of them lawyers, still face charges. One, Stevenson Dunn, a high school friend of Mr. Walters, was also charged with racketeering conspiracy. Charges of bribery, extortion, wire fraud and money laundering were brought against the others: Lee Hymowitz and Michael Freeman, the lawyers; and Sergio Benitez, Robert Morales and Angel Villalona.
Mr. Walters used some of the kickbacks, prosecutors said, to renovate a town house on West 139th Street, in Harlem's Strivers' Row. He received the house, investigators alleged, as a form of bribe from a developer who had obtained Mr. Walters's help in obtaining ''lucrative H.P.D. contracts.'' That developer has since died.
Mr. Walters, who was responsible for new construction, rose to the upper ranks of the housing agency, which the city calls the nation's largest municipal builder of affordable housing, during the scheme. He became a central figure in one of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's signature initiatives, an $8.5 billion plan to preserve or build 165,000 apartments for middle-class and working-class New Yorkers.
Mr. Walters faces a maximum of 20 years in prison. As part of the broader case, prosecutors are also seeking forfeiture of $22 million in proceeds that the defendants are said to have received as a result of their schemes. It is not clear how much prosecutors will seek from Mr. Walters.

HEADLINE: Hold That Bridge! This Dilapidated Warehouse Is a Landmark

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco.; sjames@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Scott James is a columnist for The Bay Citizen.
On the easternmost tip of Yerba Buena Island, there is a balancing act to behold -- one that might impress a Cirque du Soleil contortionist.
The massive steel infrastructure that supports construction of the new Bay Bridge carefully straddles a dilapidated 19th-century warehouse. This nondescript, reportedly asbestos-infested wreck had been discarded for most of a century.
Some consider the structure, known as Building 262, so historically important that the new $6 billion bridge construction must be accomplished without disturbing or damaging the relic. 
Asked how much it has cost to work around the warehouse or whether the effort had caused construction delays, a spokeswoman for Caltrans declined to comment. She did say the agency was doing what was required to comply with regulations.
The new bridge, which will replace the span damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and is vital to both public safety and the economy, is now scheduled to open in 2013. It has taken more than 20 years -- or a generation -- to complete.
Caltrans routinely welcomes news media to the work zone for reports on the bridge's progress but denied multiple requests for access to the warehouse area to see the preservation efforts. Effie Milionis, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the building was not in Caltrans's jurisdiction.
I finally got to visit the site last week with a San Francisco city official (the city controls the land and building as part of its acquisition of the area from the Navy). It sits in the middle of the work zone, closely surrounded on all sides by bridge construction.
Originally named the Torpedo Storehouse, the building was constructed by the Army in 1891 for the assembly and storage of mines (then called torpedoes). As warfare technology changed, it fell into disuse and was transferred to the Navy in 1960.
In person it is difficult to see why the old warehouse -- which is tightly enveloped in chain-linked fencing, with withered plywood covering the windows and doors -- should have an impact on something as important as the bridge construction. Elsewhere it would be considered blight.
But it is not the only aging structure on the island to have an impact on construction of the new bridge.
In 1998 the Navy halted construction for a year and a half over concerns the bridge would cast a shadow over the onetime home of Admiral Chester Nimitz, the World War II hero, according to a 2010 ''60 Minutes'' report.
Then Sept. 11 happened, and the cost of insurance and financing skyrocketed, said Byron Pitts, a reporter. ''Then a building boom in China drove the prices of steel and concrete to record highs,'' Mr. Pitts said. ''By the time ground was broken in 2002, the price tag of the new bridge doubled.''
Today, the structures that contributed to such great cost overruns appear neglected. A visit this month found the buildings barely used, looking haggard, and some windows boarded with plywood. Enormous eucalyptus trees surround and bathe the properties in nearly perpetual shadow, undermining the Navy's original arguments.
But this was never really just about shadows or history. The buildings were pawns in a much larger power play, according to Karen Trapenberg Frick, assistant director of the University of California Transportation Research Center. Her 341-page doctoral dissertation in 2005 analyzed the decision-making process that went into the bridge's construction.
Dr. Frick said the bridge was typical of projects this size, where issues like historic building concerns are commonly used as bargaining points. In this case, the agendas involved future development of the island and placement of the bridge. It could have been directed southwest, disrupting the Port of Oakland.
''What you were really balancing was San Francisco growth versus Port of Oakland growth,'' Dr. Frick said.
Whatever the intentions, invoking historic buildings has implications. As part of the deals struck, a detailed investigation was done in 2004 to determine the Torpedo Storehouse's provenance.
Toni Webb, an architectural historian with JRP Historical Consulting, reported it was the only remaining building ''that signifies and commemorates nearly a half-century of Army presence on this island.'' And it was built by the renowned architect Ernest Leslie Ransome and is one of America's earliest examples of reinforced concrete construction.
Ms. Webb's research put the Torpedo Storehouse on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.
So even though Caltrans agreed years ago to protect the building, today it has little choice. It's now a federal crime to wreck the wreck.

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.
Museums
- American Folk Art Museum: 'Jubilation Rumination: Life, Real and Imagined' (through Sept. 2) Having escaped the ugly, West 53rd Street tomb of a building it inhabited from 2001 to 2011, the American Folk Art Museum has reoccupied its old space on Lincoln Square. This wonderful show of about 100 works from the permanent collection samples all the varieties of artistic expression under the museum's purview, from portraits and quilts by anonymous craftspeople to otherworldly fantasies envisioned by so-called Outsiders like Henry Darger and Martin Ramirez. The revival of this irreplaceable institution is cause of rejoicing. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue, at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
Asia Society and Museum: 'Princes and Painters in Mughal Delhi 1707-1857' (through May 6) This exhibition covers the late reign of the rich and powerful Mughals, from whom we derive the word mogul, tracking their decline, which coincided with the rise of British rule in India. Wall texts describe imperial intrigue and violence while paintings depict serene landscapes and interiors and exquisitely drawn courtly figures. There are British colonial patrons called ''White Mughals'' because they had Indian families and adopted local customs, and a final section in which the gruesome narrative told in the texts fuses with the images, in the medium of photography, in works like ''Zafar in Captivity,'' which shows the last Mughal emperor as a profoundly defeated man. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Martha Schwendener)
Bronx Museum of the Arts: 'Juan Downey: The Invisible Architect' (through May 20) In the wilder moments of his career, Mr. Downey, who died of cancer in 1993 at 53 and is getting his first United States museum retrospective here, reversed the traditional dynamic of sculpture, examining how humans could affect objects rather than the other way around; administered oxygen to pedestrians on the street in New York in ''Fresh Air'' (1972); and cohabitated as a kind of gonzo anthropologist -- or early implementer of art as social practice -- with the Yanomami Indians in Venezuela. Central to his vision, which drew on Frederick Kubler, critical theory and hallucinogenic states of mind, Mr. Downey also developed a concept of ''invisible architecture'' which he described in 1973 as ''an attitude of total communication within which ultra-developed minds will be telepathically cellular to an electromagnetic whole.'' 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, the Bronx, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
- The Cloisters: 'The Game of Kings: Medieval Ivory Chessmen From the Isle of Lewis' (through April 22) In 1831, a farmer on the Isle of Lewis, the largest island of the Outer Hebrides, discovered a lost cache of medieval chess pieces. Today, thanks to ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' in which Harry and Ron play with magically animated replicas of them, the Lewis Chessmen are world famous. On tour from the British Museum, these adorable, bug-eyed little kings, queens, bishops, knights and warders, each beautifully carved from walrus ivory, are wonderful to examine up close. You don't have to be a chess player or a Harry Potter fan to love them. 99 Margaret Corbin Drive, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 923-3700, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Frick Collection: 'A Passion for Drawings: Charles Ryskamp's Bequest to the Frick Collection' (through April 8) Modern museums have their origins in the German wunderkammer, or cabinet of curiosities: collections of objects assembled by European aristocrats. The cabinet at the Frick doesn't hold the same range of marvels, but the current show of 10 drawings donated by Charles Ryskamp, a former Frick director, functions almost like a wunderkammer. There is a botanical watercolor by Pierre-Joseph Redoute, who worked for Marie Antoinette before the French Revolution and Empress Josephine afterward; a watercolor by Eugene Delacroix from his first journey to North Africa; a William Blake drawing created during a seance; and George Stubbs's portrait of Warren Hastings, first governor-general of India under British colonial rule, as Hastings was being prosecuted for corruption. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Schwendener)
- Frick Collection: 'Renoir, Impressionism and Full-Length Painting' (through May 13) Impressionism, like fashion, is dedicated to the fleeting sensation: this moment's light, this season's dress. Yet the works in this exhibition, which transforms the Frick's mohair-upholstered East Gallery into a runway for Renoir's soigne Parisians, don't at first register as Impressionist. With their traditional portrait format and imposing scale, they seem at odds with the modest plein-air paintings that define the movement. Central among them is the Frick's own Renoir, ''La Promenade'' (1875-6), in which a stylish young woman guides two equally well-dressed little girls along a public garden path. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
Frick Collection: 'White Gold: Highlights From the Arnhold Collection of Meissen Porcelain' (through April 29) Porcelain lovers will not want to miss this show of domestic ware made in Germany in the early 1700s, but the big news is the new wing, the Portico Gallery, that it inaugurates. The Frick has transformed an outdoor colonnade into an indoor exhibition space. Floor-to-ceiling windows enclose a long, narrow space that feels bigger and airier than its actual 850 square feet. In the small rotunda at one end, a life-size, nude Diana by Jean-Antoine Houdon looks out over the traffic on Fifth Avenue with divine indifference. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)
- Guggenheim Museum: 'John Chamberlain: Choices' (through May 13) The postwar sculptor John Chamberlain, who died in December, manipulated crushed car parts into abstract clusters that are both gorgeous and terrifying. As installed on the Guggenheim Museum's curved ramps for this full-dress retrospective, they look, inevitably, like mangled wrecks on a speedway. Yet the show goes to great lengths to extricate Mr. Chamberlain from what he called ''the car-crash syndrome.'' It includes work made from foam, aluminum foil, paper and plexiglass, and it emphasizes the collage process behind the metal sculptures rather than the material that went into them. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
- Guggenheim Museum: 'Francesca Woodman' (through June 13) Francesca Woodman, the photographer who was 22 when she took her own life in 1981, is as close to a true saint as the putatively secular world of contemporary art can claim. The dreamy, formally playful and disarmingly erotic pictures she made -- mostly of herself partly unclothed or naked -- project a self surrendering unreservedly to the spirit of art. Viewing this riveting survey of her sadly abbreviated career, it is hard to shake off the admittedly absurd notion that she was too pure an artist for this muddy world. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)
International Center of Photography: 'The Loving Story: Photographs by Grey Villet' (through May 6) Richard and Mildred Loving, an interracial couple from Virginia whose marriage prompted a benchmark 1967 Supreme Court ruling overturning state miscegenation laws, are portrayed not as political activists, but as political heroes who fell into history by accident. The story began on July 11, 1958, when a Virginia county sheriff and two deputies entered the Lovings' bedroom at 2 a.m. and arrested them, saying they had violated the Racial Integrity Act. Mr. Villet's images represent the heyday of social documentary, but also the midcentury photo-essay format. Ms. Loving later became a conscious activist when, on the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling, she made a statement supporting the right to marry, whether ''black or white, young or old, gay or straight.'' 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Schwendener)
- International Center of Photography: 'Weegee: Murder Is My Business' (through Sept. 2) From the home of Weegee's voluminous archive, the latest exhibition about this great documentary photographer (1899-1968) revisits his frenetic, formative first decade of work, starting in 1935, when his often sensational images of murder and mayhem appeared in New York's daily newspapers. His penchant for self-promotion; the work of his competitors and peers; the evolution of tabloid journalism; and the great city that was both his subject and his audience are emphasized, with fresh curatorial precision and deftly used touch screens. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Roberta Smith)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Byzantium and Islam: Age of Transition' (through July 8) Concluding the Met's series of Byzantine art blockbusters, this show tells the story of the Byzantine Empire in the Eastern Mediterranean, from Syria through Egypt and across North Africa, as it made contact with (and lost ground to) the emerging Islamic world between the seventh and ninth centuries. Loans from Egypt could not be secured, because of the continuing turmoil of the Arab Spring, but important pieces from Jordan, Greece and Georgia are among the show's highlights. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Chinese Art in an Age of Revolution: Fu Baoshi (1904-1965)' (through April 15) Serene on the surface but less so underneath, the museum's first full-dress retrospective of a 20th-century Chinese painter is as much about history as art history. It focuses on an artist, teacher and art historian who helped preserve the ancient tradition of ink painting and then struggled to make it relevant under the Communists, bending it toward propaganda, introducing a new degree of realism and making frequent use of the color red. While fascinating, the show leaves you wondering what he might have accomplished under less encumbered circumstances. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Rembrandt and Degas: Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man' (through May 20) This lovely small show, focused on self-portrait paintings and prints, proposes that Rembrandt was a greater influence on Degas than has generally been recognized. Degas as a young man studied Rembrandt prints, copied at least one and made others imitating Rembrandt-type effects. But a group of four captivating self-portraits at the heart of the show -- two by each artist painted at age 23 -- suggests that the men were temperamentally about as alike as a cat and a dog.

Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Spies in the House of Art: Photography, Film, and Video' (through Aug. 26) This exhibition of 17 contemporary works inspired by museums doesn't mention Theodor Adorno by name, but it nods toward his ideas in a wall text, which jokes that artists often see museums as ''mausoleums, places where art goes to die.'' Andrea Fraser's video ''Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk'' (1989) leans toward the anti-museum view, while a 16mm film by Nashashibi/Skaer, the duo of British artists Rosalind Nashashibi and Lucy Skaer, made by gliding through the Met in the dark with a camera and a flash strobe, treats the museum like a darkened crypt. Lutz Bacher's video offers another museum tour, while the museum appears in poetically distorted form in photographs by John Pilson, Tim Davis and Lothar Baumgarten. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Steins Collect: Matisse, Picasso, and the Parisian Avant-Garde' (through June 3) Like the family it chronicles, this exhibition is fragmented and contentious with flashes of brilliance. It explores the closely intertwined collections of the siblings Leo, Gertrude and Michael Stein (and Michael's wife, Sarah), casting these wealthy American expatriates as ahead-of-the-curve art patrons whose tastes and social networks shaped Modernism as we know it. And it shows Matisse and Picasso vying for the Steins' attention. Highlights include Matisse's Fauvist ''Woman With a Hat'' and, naturally, Picasso's proto-cubist portrait of Gertrude. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Storytelling in Japanese Art' (through May 6) An uncannily contemporary sense of fluidity, action and emotion courses throughout this captivating exhibition, which traces the Japanese penchant for narrative through hand scrolls, hanging scrolls and books, on to the expanded field of folding screens. The sublime 13th-century ''Illustrated Legends of the Kitano Tenjin Shrine'' alone is a must-see: its five hand scrolls constitute one of the Met's greatest paintings and have never before been shown together. Return visits are merited. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
- MoMA PS1: 'Henry Taylor' (through April 9) Mr. Taylor, who lives in Los Angeles, paints fast, loose and sensuously on canvases great and small. Portraiture is his work's center of gravity, African-American life his subject. With exuberant generosity, he portrays friends, relatives, acquaintances from the art world and off the street and heroes of sports and politics. Along the way, he takes in downbeat cityscapes patrolled by cop cars and envisions allegories of spiritual trauma in the Land of the Free. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Johnson)
- Morgan Library & Museum: 'Rembrandt's World: Dutch Drawings From the Clement C. Moore Collection' (through April 29) You won't see much of Rembrandt in this exhibition of about 90 works on paper, which includes just four drawings attributed to that master. What the show lacks in star power, though, it makes up for with a keen, all-encompassing look at life in the Dutch Republic during its Golden Age (which corresponds, roughly, to the 17th century). Seascapes assert naval dominance; genre scenes show bustling markets and tipsy taverngoers; botanical illustrations tell cautionary tales about economic speculation. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
- Morgan Library & Museum: 'Dan Flavin: Drawing' (through July 1) The artist Dan Flavin (1933-96) is so closely identified with his signature medium, the fluorescent light sculpture, that a show of his drawings is bound to surprise. And it's particularly exciting to find that Flavin was not only a devoted draftsman but also a freewheeling polymath on paper. The Morgan's show includes drawings from Flavin's personal collection, which encompasses Hokusai, Mondrian and the Hudson River School and will completely change the way you see his art. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
- El Museo del Barrio: 'Testimonios: 100 Years of Popular Expression' (through May 6) The city's premier museum of Latin culture explores its holdings in urban folk art, so-called handicraft and other forms of vernacular expression and comes up with visual gold. Among the kaleidoscopic displays are Puerto Rican santos and the winsome cellophane animals, birds and insects of Gregorio Marzan (1906-97). Splendid textiles include Haitian voodoo banners; densely appliqued molas and the patchwork scenes called arpilleras, with which Chilean women kept hope alive for disappeared relatives during the regime of Augusto Pinochet. An intoxicating, if sometimes bittersweet, vitality is revealed. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Print/Out' and 'Printin'' ' (through May 14) ''Print/Out'' presents printed works by 40 artists and artist groups from the museum's permanent collection. Produced over the past two decades, most involve public modes of address borrowed from the worlds of advertizing and design and concepts promoting critical suspicion of mainstream media, culture and society. ''Printin','' a related print-focused exhibition, is full of surprises addressing multiple aspects of human experience. With fearless eclecticism, it ranges from a Krazy Kat cartoon by George Herriman to Puritan stocks cut from cardboard by Cady Noland. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Diego Rivera: Murals for the Museum of Modern Art' (through May 14) This show reunites five of the eight free-standing frescoes that Rivera made for a 1931-2 exhibition at MoMA. Some of these paintings seem ripped from current headlines. In ''The Uprising,'' protesting laborers are brutally suppressed by uniformed soldiers; the stratified New York cityscape of ''Frozen Assets'' tops a bank vault with a crowded homeless shelter. Timely as they are, they lack the multitudinous energy and narrative sweep of Rivera's permanently sited murals. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Cindy Sherman' (through June 11) Aided by ever-shifting arrays of costumes, wigs, makeup, props, masks and prosthetic body parts, the leading light of postmodern photo-based art spent nearly four decades turning photography against itself, laying waste to a lexicon of mostly female stereotypes and exposing both the tyranny and the inner lives of the images of women that bombard and shape us all at every turn. This retrospective could have been larger, more clearly organized and less familiar, but its strengths, like the achievement it honors, are undeniable. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of the City of New York: 'Cecil Beaton: The New York Years' (through April 22) A British dandy in the Wildean mold, Beaton photographed fashion for Vogue and Vanity Fair; made photographic portraits of rich, famous and glamorous people; drew and painted cartoons, caricatures, fashion illustrations and theatrical sets with a deft hand; published six volumes of his diaries; and won two Oscars for his costume and set designs, for the Hollywood movies ''Gigi'' and ''My Fair Lady.'' He spent much time in New York, and this entertaining exhibition surveys what he did here during his five-decade career. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Johnson)
Neue Galerie: 'The Ronald S. Lauder Collection: Selections From the 3rd Century B.C. to the 20th Century/Germany, Austria and France' (through April 2) Since it opened 10 years ago, the Neue Galerie has stayed true to its narrowly focused mission: to showcase German and Austrian art and design of the early 20th century. But its anniversary exhibition of the collection of the co-founder Ronald S. Lauder covers much more territory. In the dark-wood-paneled gallery on the second floor, for instance, six paintings by Cezanne preside over an imposing installation of arms and armor and 15th- and 16th-century German and Netherlandish portraiture. And a third-floor gallery of Picasso, Matisse and Brancusi amounts to a mini-Museum of Modern Art improbably wedged into a Carrere-and-Hastings town house. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
New Museum: 'The Ungovernables: 2012 New Museum Triennial' (through April 22) The second edition of this survey of young talent, organized by Eungie Joo, is more international than the last one, with artists from Asia and South America and collectives from Africa and the Middle East. Much of the work is made up of small, light formal gestures, unemphatic in tone and socially engaged, though in an unperturbed way that accommodates friendliness and wit. There is also a schedule of performances on- and off-site. An Israeli collective, Public Movement, will stage topical debates around town. Yet another collective, House of Natural Fiber, from Indonesia, plans to demonstrate technology for producing alcoholic beverages and electronic music simultaneously. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
Noguchi Museum: 'Civic Action: A Vision for Long Island City' (through April 22) Several artists suggest their visions for the future of Long Island City, ranging from site-specific to silly. Natalie Jeremijenko's ''feral robots'' sniff out pollutants in contaminated soil, and she suggests hula hoops filled with wildflower seeds. Rirkrit Tiravanija proposes growing ''drivable'' grass along a section of Broadway, and Mary Miss focuses on four giant smokestacks that tower over the area and imagines them as an eco-feedback center registering environmental changes visible to the community. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Schwendener)
- Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Whitney Biennial 2012' (through May 27) With remarkable clarity of vision, striking spatial intelligence and a generous stylistic inclusiveness, one of the best Whitney Biennials in recent memory confidently weaves together art objects and time-based art -- dance, theater and performance as well as film and video -- on a scale unprecedented in New York. So doing, this especially poetic incarnation also reinvents the museum's signature show and places future biennial curators in its debt, while offering the out-of-control, money-saturated art world a bit of redemption. Visit early and often. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Galleries: Uptown
'Approaching the Horizon: Important Japanese Prints From the Brewster Hanson Collection' (through April 13) Unfamiliar landscape prints by familiar names -- mainly Katsushika Hokusai and Utagawa Hiroshige -- dominate this lavish show, and their superb condition has kept the colors strikingly vivid. The grandly descriptive can turn grandly abstract on a dime, especially when Hokusai tackles waterfalls in vertical formats. Also noteworthy are the prints of his lesser-known contemporary Keisai Eisen, whose inclination to give tumbling water the solidity of nearby rocks has a bracing visionary force. Joan B. Mirviss, 39 East 78th Street, (212) 799-4021, mirviss.com. (Smith)
'Hats: An Anthology by Stephen Jones' (through April 15) This wide-ranging survey was assembled by one of the leading milliners in Britain and draws heavily on the incomparable collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. It includes fascinating historical material; a survey of 20th- and 21st-century headgear at its most creative (and often most frivolous); and rather too many efforts by the show's organizer. But what's good is great: for example, a platterlike feather number from 18th-century London. Bard Graduate Center: Decorative Arts, Design History, Material Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, bgc.bard.edu. (Smith)
Jenny Holzer: 'Endgame' (through April 7) This bluntly provocative show presents the first paintings Ms. Holzer has made since her student years in the mid-1970s. They resemble her well-known silk-screen copies of United States government-censored documents related to war in the Middle East. But here the redacted areas are painted to resemble types of Modernist abstraction, implicitly indicting aesthetics-first art for its political obliviousness. It is a tired conceptual gambit. Skarstedt Gallery, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 737-2060, skarstedt.com. (Johnson)
'Kokon Biannual: Spring 2012' (through April 10) The works here range in size from two six-panel screens by the great Kano Tan'yu (1602-74) that make brilliant proto-Minimalist use of empty space, to a rectangular stoneware dish decorated with bellflowers and pampas grasses by the inimitable Ogata Kenzan (1663-1743). A 14th-century star mandala and a fan with a painted landscape by Tan'yu's grandfather, Kano Eitoku (1543-90), are among the other rarities in this inspiring show, made all the more so by the gallery's elegantly serene design. Koichi Yanagi Oriental Fine Arts, 17 East 71st Street, (212) 744-5577, jada-ny.org. (Smith)
Galleries: 57th Street
- 'Silver and Gold in Ancient China' (through April 14) Ranging from a first-century B.C. silver harness ornament depicting a winged stallion to bevies of gold hair ornaments depicting dragons, birds and flowers from the 10th to 14th centuries (Liao, Northern Song and Song dynasties), this exhibition provides a rare in-depth at ceremonial and luxury objects. Forms, purposes, techniques and surface decoration vary tremendously and to illuminating effect. Standouts include a chased silver Liao dynasty funeral mask and a Song pictorial dish engraved with a marvelous landscape scene of scholars drifting in a boat. Instructive pleasures abound. J. J. Lally & Co. Oriental Art, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 371-3380, jjlally.com. (Smith)
Galleries: Chelsea
Paul Graham: 'The Present' (through April 21) This latest series by the British photographer Paul Graham was shot entirely in high-traffic areas of Manhattan (Penn Station, Times Square and 125th Street, among others). Its 16 diptychs and 2 triptychs have a simple premise: They show two or three views of the same intersection, taken seconds apart and from more or less the same angle. People go out of focus or disappear entirely and are replaced by new pedestrians doing pretty much the same thing. Cabs speed by, cellphone conversations end, attentions are diverted and street photography is reinvented for an age of perpetual distraction. The Pace Gallery and Pace/MacGill, 545 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-4258, thepacegallery.com. (Rosenberg)
- Terry Winters: 'Cricket Music, Tessellation Figures, & Notebook' (through April 14) Terry Winters's new, vigorously painted abstractions are ravishing. As if to defend against anti-hedonist judgment, Mr. Winters also offers a series of notebook collages combining scientific and quasi-scientific imagery in Matthew Marks's small exhibition space at 502 West 22nd Street. They are interesting, but the paintings of flickering, warping, spiraling and tunneling diamond patterns in hot and cool colors are the real trip. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 and 502 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Johnson)
Galleries: Other
- 'The Brucennial 2012: Harderer. Betterer. Fasterer. Strongerer.' (through April 20) Organized by the collective of anonymous artists known as the Bruce High Quality Foundation, this jampacked, multifloor exhibition displays paintings, sculptures, videos and more by close to 400 artists. A radically inclusive survey of what artists in New York really are doing outside the filtering systems of galleries, museums and curators, it is by turns exhilarating, numbing and depressing. Don't miss it. 159 Bleecker Street, at Thompson Street, Greenwich Village, thebrucehighqualityfoundation.com. (Johnson)
Guy Goodwin: 'Recent Works' (through April 8) The latest paintings by this veteran abstractionist are laugh-out-loud beautiful. They amp up his longtime interest in bold, roughly painted motifs and objectlike impact through the use of searing color and cut-out (and cut-into) laminated cardboard, with obsessive stapling doing double time as brushwork. More comedic than existential, they make a place for themselves in the tradition of raucous American abstraction that could be said begin with Stuart Davis and George Sugarman. Brennan & Griffin, 55 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 227-0115, brennangriffin.com. ( Smith)
Sam Moyer: 'Slack Tide' (through April 22) Sam Moyer's beguiling, expansive pictures oscillate astutely between the sublime and the decorative. Mounted on panels whose dimensions range from about 5 to 10 feet, they resemble much-enlarged, black-and-white, aerial photographs of mountainous topographies, possibly on another planet. They also are like giant, dark photocopies of profusely wrinkled bed sheets. But they are entirely made by hand. Rachel Uffner Gallery, 47 Orchard Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side, (212) 274-0064, racheluffnergallery.com. (Johnson)
- Duro Olowu: 'Material' (through March 31) Assembled by the London fashion designer Duro Olowu, this amalgam of art, artifacts, furniture, jewelry, photographs, books and garments offers an inspired antidote to the ultra-Conceptual, undervisual, often color-free curatorial approach frequent to New York gallery group shows. It moves across time and continents, makes illuminating juxtapositions and includes invigorating feats of recycling. Mr. Olowu's dresses, which typically and distinctively combine bold, contrasting printed fabrics, encapsulate the paradisiacal culture clash that rules the room. Salon 94 Freemans, 1 Freeman Alley, between the Bowery and Chrystie Street, Lower East Side, (212) 529-7400, salon94.com. (Smith)
'Soto: Paris and Beyond: 1950-1970' (through March 31) Once a figure of international renown, Jesus Soto is now mostly remembered as a minor Modernist who worked in the overlap among hard-edge abstraction, kinetic art and Op Art. This show will not precipitate a run to revive his reputation, but it does open an intriguing window on the mid-20th-century philosophical landscape of Modern art. Still perceptually arresting are constructions from the '50s, in which you view abstract compositions through similarly painted plexiglass panels. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Johnson)
- 'Bill Walton' (through April 1) Mounted by two Lower East Side galleries, this stunning show introduces the distinctive achievement of Bill Walton (1931-2010), a sculptor prominent in nearby Philadelphia for nearly 40 years. Brilliantly adept at transforming discarded materials and neglected objects into small pristine assemblages and sculptural tableaus, often arranged on tiny cantilevered perches, Walton brought an almost radiant sense of syntactical rightness to Post-Minimalism. At once self-effacing and fiercely ambitious, his works anoint him as a sculptor's sculptor, a painter's sculptor and a poet's sculptor, all rolled into one. James Fuentes, 55 Delancey Street, (212) 577-1201, jamesfuentes.com; JTT, 170A Suffolk Street, near Houston Street, (212) 574-8152, jttnyc.com. (Smith)
Out of Town
Neuberger Museum of Art: 'American Vanguards: Graham, Davis, Gorky, de Kooning, and Their Circle, 1927-1942' (through April 29) This exhibition, organized by the Addison Gallery of American Art in Andover, Mass., reunites the Four Musketeers of New York painting: John Graham, Arshile Gorky, Stuart Davis and Willem de Kooning. For a time -- the 1930s, give or take a few years -- these artists linked arms to defend modern American art against the dreariness and insularity of the Depression. One might see this show as an expansion of the first few galleries of the Museum of Modern Art's recent de Kooning retrospective, with their eerie still lifes and fidgety figure paintings that seemed to collapse abstraction and representation. Purchase College, State University of New York, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6100, neuberger.org. (Rosenberg)
Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts: 'Henry Ossawa Tanner: Modern Spirit' (through April 15) Henry Ossawa Tanner (1859-1937) was the first African-American artist to achieve international fame in modern times. After permanently expatriating to France in 1891, he found success as a painter of luminous pictures of biblical subjects. In this informative survey of his career, one piece stands out: an Annunciation in which the angel Gabriel appears to Mary as a burst of yellow light. It is a painting of amazing grace. 118 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, (215) 972-7600, pafa.org. (Johnson)
- Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Zoe Strauss: Ten Years' (through April 22) In 2001 the artist Zoe Strauss came up with an unusual idea for an exhibition. It would take place under an elevated section of Interstate 95, in her home city, Philadelphia, and would consist of photographs mounted on the columns that supported the highway. It would be a recurring event, appearing yearly over a decade, and would be free and accessible to the public. That series, ''I-95,'' is at the core of ''Zoe Strauss: Ten Years,'' an engaging, parameter-expanding exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and on billboards around the city. In it, the highway links sweeping literary ambition and local interest, lyrical and documentary photography, portraiture and the urban landscape. Benjamin Franklin Parkway and 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Van Gogh Up Close' (through May 6) Nature both inspired van Gogh's extraordinary art and calmed his perpetually jangled nerves, and this modest yet groundbreaking show of 45 often small, unfamiliar canvases -- devoted almost entirely to landscapes -- examines his crucial connection to its bounty. The selection cuts a narrow, well-organized path through his art, examining the terrains he painted, the often close-up viewpoints he used and the shifting topographies of his paint textures, leading us to the fullness of his achievement along a fresh and eye-opening route. 26th Street at Benjamin Franklin Parkway, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Smith)
Last Chance
Asia Society and Museum: 'Sarah Sze: Infinite Line' (closes on Sunday) Promising a new angle on Sarah Sze's mesmerizing, minutely detailed installations, this midcareer solo reveals that Ms. Sze, who is Chinese-American, has been profoundly influenced by many forms of Asian art. It also includes some of her rarely exhibited drawings and encourages you to see her three-dimensional artworks as drawings in space. Implicitly, it de-emphasizes the prosaic nature of her art materials: the cotton swabs, toothpicks, bottle caps and other throwaway objects that she fashions, with gee-whiz structural ingenuity, into rambling landscapes and galactic spirals. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Rosenberg)
Antoine Catala: 'I See Catastrophes Ahead' (closes on Sunday) Antoine Catala's amusingly inventive, computer-controlled installation consists of five conceptually and electrically linked parts. Holograph-like images, vacuum-activated devices and the sound of a cat's meow, along with other puzzling elements, spell out the exhibition's title in the form of a rebus. 47 Canal, 47 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (646) 415-7712, 47canalstreet.com. (Johnson)
- Jewish Museum: 'The Radical Camera: New York's Photo League, 1936-1951' (closes on Sunday) One of many artistic casualties of the McCarthy-era blacklists was the Photo League, a New York school and salon for amateur and professional photographers. Its members -- among them Weegee, Lisette Model and Aaron Siskind -- are now reunited in this stirring show, which traces the group's history through some 145 vintage photographs. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Sanja Ivekovic: Sweet Violence' (closes on Monday) This timely and resonant survey familiarizes American audiences with the spare, selfless achievement of this pioneering Croatian artist, born in Zagreb in 1949. Conceptual in style, photo- and performance-based in approach, political in motivation, ardently and precisely feminist, her work makes use of materials at hand -- personal photographs, women's magazines, state-sponsored television, even government surveillance -- to dissect different forms of power and illuminate the plight of the powerless, while also presaging familiar developments in appropriation art and relational aesthetics to a startling degree. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Elaine Reichek: 'Ariadne's Thread' (closes on Saturday) Ariadne, the clever heroine of Greek myth whose ball of thread helped Theseus escape from the Minotaur's labyrinth, makes an ideal subject for Elaine Reichek (who has been working with thread since the 1970s and has a large-scale tapestry in the current Whitney Biennial). In this show she uses digital and hand embroidery and silk-screen process to reproduce a wide range of images and literary quotations relating to Ariadne. Keeping this exercise from becoming pedantic, Ms. Reicheck finds elements of the myth where we least expect them: in comic books and the film ''The Shining,'' for instance. Nicole Klagsbrun Project Space, 534 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-3335, nicoleklagsbrun.com. (Karen Rosenberg)
Haegue Yang: 'Multi Faith Room' (through Saturday) Haegue Yang's first New York gallery solo, ''Multi Faith Room,'' doesn't quite hold together as an installation. But that may be the idea, judging from the show's reference point: the prayer spaces in airports, which must serve transient worshipers of diverse religious backgrounds. The works include several ''Towers on String,'' which turn suspended Venetian blinds into architectural fantasias, and her treelike ''Towel Light Sculptures,'' of printed terry cloth, pet accessories and other found objects bound with rope and strung up on clothing racks. Greene Naftali, 508 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-7770, greenenaftaligallery.com. (Rosenberg)

HEADLINE: New Unemployment Claims Drop to a Four-Year Low

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell to a four-year low last week, bolstering the view that the job market is strengthening. 
The Labor Department said on Thursday that weekly applications for jobless benefits dropped by 5,000, to a seasonally adjusted 348,000. That is the lowest level since March 2008, just months into the recession. The four-week average of jobless claims, a less volatile measure, dipped to 355,000, matching a four-year low.
Applications for jobless benefits have steadily declined since the fall. The drop has coincided with the best three months of hiring in two years. From December through February, employers added an average of 245,000 jobs a month. That has pushed down the unemployment rate to 8.3 percent, the lowest in three years.
The report suggests that employers have added a similar level of jobs this month. This week's figures cover the same week that the Labor Department surveys companies about hiring in March. Applications are slightly lower this week than in February's survey week, which points to more job growth.
''U.S. employment growth looks to have continued in March at a respectable pace,'' said Jennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets.
Separately, a measure of future economic activity rose for the fifth consecutive month.
The Conference Board said that its index of leading economic indicators rose 0.7 percent in February, after a 0.2 percent rise the previous month. The index is designed to forecast economic conditions in the next three to six months. Most of its components have already been published.
Companies are hiring more because the economy is picking up. The economy grew at an annual rate of 3 percent in the final three months of last year. That was better than the 1.8 percent rate in the previous quarter.
Most economists expect growth will slow in the current quarter to below 2.5 percent, despite the increase in hiring.
Consumers may be spending less because of rising gasoline prices and small pay increases. And slowing growth in China and a likely recession in Europe could drag on exports.
Growth should pick up later this year as rising job creation creates more spending power.
Ms. Lee forecasts that growth will accelerate to 2.9 percent in the final three months of this year, from 2.2 percent in the current quarter.
''If someone's been out of work for a long time and gets a job, they may not go out and spend all they earn,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Affordable Housing

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Lured by Visions of Real Estate Profits, Nonprofit Group Stumbled'' (news article, March 15) suggested that the Community Preservation Corporation ''strayed'' from its mission by providing ''luxury'' housing. This is not so. 
In building and preserving more than 147,000 housing units during its 37-year history, C.P.C. took many risks to support the varied and changing needs of the communities it serves -- rebuilding deteriorated low- and moderate-income neighborhoods in New York City, revitalizing downtowns in upstate New York, stabilizing failing middle-income cooperatives, creating ''work force'' housing -- hardly ''luxury'' -- for middle-income families, and restoring the 12,271-unit housing complex at Parkchester.
During the 1990s, as new housing units in New York City failed to keep pace with the population increase, building ''work force'' housing for families earning between $90,000 and $130,000 became an important part of the city and state's housing agenda, as it did for C.P.C.
C.P.C. provided such housing without using public subsidies by financing condominium buildings whose average projected sales price was affordable to households earning in the above income range.
C.P.C., like all residential lenders, was affected by the depth of the recession. For the first time it experienced significant losses, which, I believe, it has so far absorbed with its own resources.
C.P.C. has been an extraordinarily productive and important vehicle for affordable housing. I expect that it will build on this legacy and play a central role in creating affordable housing in the years ahead.

The writer is a former president of Community Preservation Corporation and C.P.C. Resources.

HEADLINE: Using Patient Surveys to Rate Hospitals

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Hospitals Aren't Hotels,'' by Theresa Brown (Op-Ed, March 15):
Over a century ago Sir William Osler, one of the founders of modern medicine, said: ''Listen to your patient. He is telling you the diagnosis.'' Sadly, this simple message -- to listen to the patient, carefully -- is often swept aside in our fragmented, procedure- and data-driven medical system.
Most patients understand that treatment can be painful and invasive. Their fear is that their pain won't be adequately managed because no one is carefully listening to them. 
Patient-centered care and patient safety go hand in hand. However, the patient's experience of illness and healing will always be individual and subjective and not easily quantifiable in scientific, medical or economic terms.
The goal of the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey is to begin to give the patient's voice parity with other clinical data. If real change in how we deliver and coordinate patient care can begin only when hospitals must hurt a little bit more -- by withholding even more reimbursements -- then perhaps the voices of patients, doctors and nurses will finally be heard, and we can build a better, safer, more equitable health care system from the bottom up.
ELIZABETH BAILEY New York, March 16, 2012
The writer is the author of ''The Patient's Checklist: 10 Simple Hospital Checklists to Keep You Safe, Sane and Organized.''
To the Editor:
Theresa Brown derides the use of hospital patient surveys because there is inherent unpleasantness in illness and in many medical treatments.
Maybe patients cannot assess the efficacy of many treatments, but they surely can tell whether they have rung the buzzer for a nurse and had to wait 20 minutes for a response; whether they have been wheeled someplace on a gurney and left alone in a hallway for what seemed like hours; whether their nurses suddenly changed their medication routines without explanation; whether a bewildering cast of medical characters came and went without explaining who they were and their functions.
These factors make a big difference in the hospital experience, and patients are well equipped to assess them.
ROBERT H. SCHAFFER Stamford, Conn., March 15, 2012
The writer is a consultant who has worked with hospitals.
To the Editor:
Theresa Brown's critique of patient experience surveys notes the value of multiple measures of patient care. We agree. Unfortunately, she also repeats two common misconceptions about the Hospital Consumer Assessments of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey, which we helped develop.
One is that there are necessarily tradeoffs between good patient experiences and good clinical care. The preponderance of the evidence (at least four recent studies) suggests the opposite: hospitals that perform better on the survey tend to do better on clinical measures, have fewer readmissions within 30 days and have lower risk-adjusted mortality.
A second misconception is that the survey is primarily a measure of satisfaction, and that high scores are achieved by catering to patients' desires for unwarranted treatment. In fact, the survey focuses on important aspects of care such as whether new medications and post-discharge care instructions were explained clearly, which can be measured only by asking the patient. Evidence suggests that patients want clear communication, not unnecessary care.
We believe neither that conscientious clinicians will withhold unpleasant but essential treatments to obtain better patient assessments, nor that patient assessments are responsible for overuse of medical care.
MARC ELLIOTT ALAN ZASLAVSKY Santa Monica, Calif., March 16, 2012
Dr. Elliott is a senior statistician at the RAND Corporation. Dr. Zaslavsky is a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. The letter was also signed by Paul D. Cleary, Susan Edgman-Levitan and Ron D. Hays. All five helped prepare the survey.
To the Editor:
Thank you, Theresa Brown, for eloquently putting the emphasis where it belongs. It is discouraging to watch medical institutions chase federal dollars through patient satisfaction surveys. Because patients are seldom the best judges of their medical care, that care cannot be measured accurately by such surveys. But more resources will be used addressing the results. It's a shame.
DAY F. HILLS Seattle, March 15, 2012
The writer is an oncologist.
To the Editor:
Hospitals aren't hotels. But most could take a lesson from Red Roof Inn on the fundamentals of serving human beings: cleanliness, order and an obliging staff.
Staff members at a university-affiliated hospital here used textbook sterile procedures -- gloves, gowns, masks -- when I underwent invasive neurological testing several months ago. But crumpled paper and hair clumps lay on the floor of my room during my entire stay.
I received efficient, competent medical care. Yet in the 36 hours that I lay on a patient bed, not once did any nurse, doctor or other staff member ask if I was comfortable or needed anything.

HEADLINE: Thomas Kovachevich: 'Alpenglow'

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
Showroom 170
170 Suffolk Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side
Through April 15
Post-Minimalism rarely strays as far from the Minimalist mother lode while adhering to its underlying principles than does the art of Thomas Kovachevich, whose barely there, self-effacing efforts have lately been widely admired by younger dealers and artists. 
Since the early 1970s, Dr. Kovachevich, a retired physician, has eschewed Minimalism's preference for heavy metals while often embracing its penchant for repeating, literal-minded ''one thing after another'' compositions. But he has never been averse to letting chance mess with the order of things; in this you could say that he splits the difference between John Cage and Donald Judd with unusual evenness.
This is apparent in Dr. Kovachevich's second Lower East Side gallery show this season. The most imposing works are made of nothing but narrow strips of white tissue-thin packing tape, topped by equal lengths of brightly colored grosgrain ribbon, installed vertically to form large, fragile-looking candy-striped rectangles on the wall. (They are pinned top and bottom but are otherwise loose.)
The effect is implicitly pictorial: more early Frank Stella meets Agnes Martin meets Gene Davis than Judd. But the literalness of the pinned-up presentation seems sculptural, as does the way the works change as the humidity rises or falls, and in the process implicates the entire room as a volume. When the air is dry, the tape curls around the ribbons, fogging their colors of pink, orange, yellow or blue and suggesting delicate versions of Dan Flavin's fluorescent tubes. When the humidity rises, the tape relaxes and flattens, revealing the ribbons' hues at full cry.
The works amount to an indoor demonstration of an optical condition known as Alpenglow: the intensely colored skies that can occur near mountains because of extremes of humidity and temperature. Here Alpenglow is summoned by means so economically elegant as to be Zen, and with results so visually entrancing as to be beautiful.

HEADLINE: Drop in Orders Overseas Sets Off an Investor Retreat

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Cyclical sectors led the stock market on Thursday, setting the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up for its first negative week in six, after factory data showed a slowdown in both Europe and China.
The weak data is hardly a surprise for markets because many analysts have already factored in a recession in Europe, and early this month China trimmed its 2012 growth target to an eight-year low of 7.5 percent.
But investors were unnerved by the drop in new orders in both regions, which highlighted concerns that an unexpectedly severe downturn could hurt the global recovery. 
The drop in demand drove calls for the pullback in stocks; the S.& P. 500 has scored 10 weeks of gains out of 11 weeks this year. The benchmark index is still near four-year highs reached on Monday.
''The advance we've had so far this year is not sustainable, and the market is taking a little breather,'' said Terry Morris, senior equity manager for National Penn Investors Trust Company in Reading, Pa.
''The market could easily come down 3 to 5 percent and still be within the context of an improving economy and continue to work higher,'' he added.
FedEx shares dragged down the Dow Jones transportation average after the giant package delivery company warned of a lower outlook, partly because of Europe's weak economy.
The S.& P. energy sector fell 2.1 percent and the basic materials sector dropped 1.6 percent.
Stocks have risen sharply this year, partly because of a steady string of better-than-expected economic data in the United States. Next week, the S.& P. 500 could wrap up its best back-to-back quarters since mid-2009.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 78.48 points Thursday, or 0.60 percent, to 13,046.14 at the close. The S.& P. 500 dropped 10.11 points, or 0.72 percent, to 1,392.78. The Nasdaq composite index lost 12.00 points, or 0.39 percent, to 3,063.32.
This was the first close below 1,400 for the S.& P. 500 in six sessions.
China's manufacturing sector activity shrank in March for a fifth successive month, while German and French manufacturing suffered a sharp decline in March that even most pessimistic economists had failed to predict.
The number of Americans claiming new unemployment benefits dropped to a four-year low last week. A separate report showed the index of leading economic indicators, a gauge aimed at predicting future economic activity in the United States, rose sharply in February, pointing to a pickup in growth even as China and Europe retreat.
FedEx fell 3.5 percent to $92.50. The Dow Jones transportation average lost 2.1 percent.
McDonald's, a Dow component, fell 1 percent to $95.80 a day after the world's biggest hamburger chain said its chief executive, James A. Skinner, was retiring after more than seven years at the helm.
A big oil services decliner was Nabors Industries, which fell 4.6 percent to $18.52.
Among basic materials shares, United States Steel tumbled 5.8 percent to $29.47. Alcoa slid 2.4 percent to $10.01 and was the Dow's largest percentage decliner.
In contrast to the overall market's declines, Dollar General advanced 3.1 percent to $46.14 after reporting higher-than-expected earnings and sales for the holiday quarter. The stock of the discount retailer, which prices most of its merchandise below $10, earlier hit an all-time high at $46.95.
Shares of ExactTarget surged 32.2 percent to $25.11 in their New York Stock Exchange debut, buoyed by investor demand for cloud computing companies.
In the bond market, Treasury prices were mostly higher for a third day after last week's selloff. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 4/32 of a point, to 97 17/32, while its yield slipped to 2.28 percent, from 2.30 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Made in Hayward: Bus Maker Finally Wins a Local Contract

BYLINE: By ZUSHA ELINSON. 
zelinson@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
For the past decade, Jose Luis Tejeda felt insulted every time he saw an Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District bus drive past his place of work.
Mr. Tejada, 60, starts his job at 5 o'clock every morning on the assembly line at Gillig, a bus manufacturer in Hayward that is known as the last 100 percent American-owned and -made bus company. But AC Transit officials, enamored with European public transit, have only bought buses from Van Hool, a Belgian company, since 2002.
''I felt kind of disappointed,'' said Mr. Tejeda, whose two sons, Cesar and Adolfo, also work at the plant. ''I felt underestimated about the quality of my job.''
Gillig finally won a contract last week from its hometown transportation agency when AC Transit agreed to buy 40 buses from the company for $16.4 million. With more than 100 buses rolling out of the Hayward plant every month, the order was relatively small, but it was a symbolic victory for Mr. Tejeda and other Gillig employees. 
AC Transit had a change of heart after the Teamsters union, which represents most of Gillig's 700 employees, flexed its political muscle in the down-ballot races for the agency's board of directors. The Gillig order was also spurred by the public outcry over money that the cash-strapped agency spent to send its officials on regular trips to Europe, including the salary and expenses of a bus inspector who lived near the Van Hool plant in Belgium.
''We used to have some guy in Europe fully paid for by AC Transit keeping an eye on all the manufacturing. It just didn't make sense,'' said Elsa Ortiz, an agency director who pushed to buy buses from Gillig. ''Now we're buying from a company that's in Hayward just 10 miles away. It's local jobs; it's improving the local economy.''
Gillig, which was founded in 1890 to build horse-drawn carriages, is a throwback to an era when manufacturing was king and American workers stayed in the same jobs for decades. Gillig employees earn an average of $40 an hour in salary and benefits. After 25 years, workers receive an all-expenses-paid Hawaiian vacation for themselves and their families.
Alameda County has lost 33,000 manufacturing jobs in the last decade, and it is still struggling to rebound from the recession, yet Gillig has continued to build buses without layoffs at its plant near the San Mateo-Hayward Bridge. Most bus companies in the United States have disappeared, and those that remain are foreign-owned or make only portions of their buses here. Gillig is the only remaining American-owned transit bus company that does all its manufacturing in the United States, according to company officials and industry experts.
But even as the loss of American manufacturing jobs has become an issue in the presidential election, political gridlock in Washington is threatening companies like Gillig. The federal transportation bill, which used to be routinely renewed every six years, has become a battleground as Republicans try to cut spending on public transit.
Although the Senate has passed a two-year transportation bill, the House, unable to settle its differences, has simply kicked the can down the road, extending financing for only a few months at a time, a path it took once again this week. The result is that transit agencies around the country, which depend on the federal government for most of the money they need to buy buses, cannot plan far enough in advance to place orders, said Joe Policarpio, vice president for sales and marketing at Gillig.
''It's been very, very difficult for our customers to plan, and there is a decrease in market demand,'' Mr. Policarpio said.
The American Public Transportation Association found in a study last year that three-fourths of companies serving the public transit industry had flat or declining revenues because of the uncertainty around federal transportation financing and the recession. Mr. Policarpio said that bus orders were down 25 percent industrywide.
Because of the low demand for buses and trains in this country, there are virtually no major American-owned manufacturers. When the Bay Area Rapid Transit agency put out a bid for a $3.4 billion fleet of 775 train cars in 2009, only foreign companies responded. A Canadian company, Bombardier Transportation, is the leading candidate.
''The U.S. is way behind the rest of the world when it comes to public transit,'' said Paul Oversier, assistant general manager for operations at BART.
Aside from Gillig, there are other companies that build trains and buses in this country. Because of so-called Buy America laws, transit agencies using federal money must purchase rail cars and buses from companies that produce 60 percent of the total value of the vehicle in the United States. That means most foreign companies have manufacturing plants here.
But ordering from foreign companies means extra costs. BART has already spent more than $95,000 in travel expenses this year for employees to visit France, China, South Korea, Mexico, Canada and cities around the United States to inspect plants run by Bombardier and the other two bidders, Hyundai Rotem of South Korea and Alstom of France.
In December, rail cars made by Bombardier in Chicago were recalled because of faulty parts made by a Chinese supplier, highlighting the need for the inspectors, Mr. Oversier said.
''It is an example of why the owner needs to be aggressive and do their due diligence when the cars are being designed and built,'' said Mr. Oversier, who declined to comment on how the Chicago recall might affect Bombardier's bid.
At AC Transit, the Belgian-made Van Hool buses have their fans. Chris Peeples, a longtime agency board member, said the European company produced far more advanced buses than Gillig.
''Our direction to our general manager was to bring a bus over that would embarrass the U.S. bus industry into making a decent bus, and I think we succeeded,'' Mr. Peeples said.
Mr. Peeples said that Gillig was not willing to build the buses that AC Transit wanted for its rapid lines -- buses with three doors and low floors. But critics said the Belgian buses did not deliver on all the company's promises.
''They were sold to the board on the basis of, you know, how we elite Americans tend to think that everything is done better in Europe, so there was this feeling that if you want good transit, go to Europe,'' said Greg Harper, who is also on the AC Transit board. ''They just didn't turn out to be any of those things. They weren't better priced; they weren't better made.''
Gillig makes buses for transit agencies nationwide, including the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority in the South Bay and SamTrans in San Mateo County. The company is the second largest manufacturer in North America, making between 25 percent and 35 percent of the 4,000 to 6,000 buses produced here every year, Mr. Policarpio said. But the AC Transit contract was cause for extra celebration.
Lyle Funderburk, 37, who installs the rear exit door on the buses, said that his children would point to AC Transit buses on the streets and ask, ''Daddy, you built that bus?'' and he would answer, ''No, we didn't.'' Now, Mr. Funderburk said, ''I can tell them, 'Daddy put that door on that bus.' ''

HEADLINE: A New Vision Of a Visionary Fisherman

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
The art of Forrest Bess (1911-77), like that of Vincent van Gogh, may be in danger of being overtaken by his life story. Especially now, when the work of this eccentric visionary painter -- who spent the bulk of his maturity as a fisherman on the Gulf of Mexico, living on a spit of Texas beach -- is having an especially intense New York moment.
The current Whitney Biennial includes a show within a show of 11 Bess paintings, organized by the sculptor Robert Gober; it proffers Bess as a kind of foundational artist of our time. And an additional 40 of his paintings can be seen in ''A Tribute to Forrest Bess,'' an exhibition at Christie's that is occasioned by a private sale of those works for a single seller. (It makes for the rather uneasy sight of an auction house acting like a commercial gallery handling what is tantamount to an artist's estate.) 
The facts of Bess's life are nothing if not sensational. They include isolation, poverty, recurring visions -- Bess said that he merely copied motifs that had appeared to him in dreams since childhood -- and even self-mutilation. In the late 1950s, convinced that uniting the male and female sides of his personality would guarantee immortality, Bess attempted to turn himself into what he called a ''pseudo-hermaphrodite'' through two acts of painful self-surgery that yielded a small vaginalike opening at the base of his penis.
But as with van Gogh's work, Bess's small, intensely personal quasi abstractions seem designed to withstand the onslaught of biography. The best of them, made from 1946 to 1970, are initially unimposing yet can rivet the eye with their roiled surfaces, saturated colors and combinations of odd symbols or distilled evocations of the natural world.
Equally important is the way Bess's works reshape art history. Like Myron Stout, Steve Wheeler and Alice Trumbull Mason, who also favored small size and resonant forms, Bess expands our understanding of the ascendancy of American painting in the 1940s and '50s far beyond the wall-size canvases of the usual Abstract Expressionist suspects.
There has not been so much of Bess's work on view in New York since 1988, when Hirschl & Adler Modern mounted a show of 61 paintings. And both the Whitney and Christie's displays include fascinating, if sometimes unsettling, ancillary information.
At the Whitney, Mr. Gober has juxtaposed the paintings with Bess's correspondence with New York art world figures like the art historian Meyer Schapiro and Betty Parsons, the leading dealer of the Abstract Expressionists. Parsons gave Bess six solo shows from 1951 to 1967, which demonstrates the extent to which this outsider was also very much an insider, as driven to exhibit his work as any painter in a downtown loft. There are also photographs of the self-surgery.
At Christie's ''Forrest Bess: Key to the Riddle,'' a marvelous 48-minute film completed in 1998 by Chuck Smith, working with the photographer Ari Marcopoulos, is being screened continuously, if not to best effect, on a small monitor. In this film you hear from numerous affectionate and understanding friends and relatives who knew Bess intimately, as well as from interested New Yorkers. These include Schapiro, the Buddhist writer Robert Thurman and John Yau, a critic who wrote an essential essay for the catalog for the Hirschl & Adler Modern show.
Mr. Thurman floats the thesis that, from a Buddhist perspective, Bess was ''maybe someone who had been a yogi in a former life.'' He notes that a yogi's role is to ''yoke your body and being to your view of life,'' calling Bess's body ''his supreme work of art.''
Mr. Yau suggests, with possibly greater plausibility for non-Buddhists, that Bess's fervent searching, as well as his self-surgery -- the idea came from studying rites performed by Australian aborigines -- reflected an inability to accept his homosexuality and, more generally, his reaction to a culture with little tolerance for difference. Mr. Yau likens the scarred surfaces of Bess's paintings to the psychic and physical scars he endured.
While the film details Bess's life and personality, it is equally valuable for zeroing in at regular intervals on dozens of outstanding examples of his works that are over all stronger than many on view at Christie's. Bess is a kind of hit-or-miss artist, and the paintings at Christie's were not ones he sent to his dealer or sold to collectors, who included the likes of John and Dominique de Menil and Stanley Marcus of Houston. Rather they were given over the years to a couple, Harry Burkhart and Jim Wilford, friends who were ultimately caretakers of sorts.
Mr. Wilford died in 2006 at the University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, to which Mr. Burkhart bequeathed the paintings upon his death in 2009. The hospital is selling them through Christie's under a three-year agreement.
Timing being everything, the Christie's show's overlap with the Biennial is hardly accidental. It is accompanied by a lavish catalog with illuminating essays by Robert Storr, the writer, curator and dean of the Yale School of Art, and the cultural critic Wayne Koestenbaum. Mr. Koestenbaum provides a very close reading of Bess's surfaces, especially his use of the palette knife and the visual vibrancy created by his quite careful trowelings. (Mr. Koestenbaum's larger points about the way the perusal of paintings can slow vision and stops time make his essay valuable for anyone interested in the medium, especially its abstract branch.)
The Christie's news release refers to the Bess paintings on view as ''master works,'' but, as if in tacit acknowledgement of the slightness of some of them, they have been supplemented by three canvases borrowed from museums that are quite a bit better than almost everything else here. One is dedicated to van Gogh, another to Albert Pinkham Ryder, and their motifs are appropriate to their inspirations.
Still, there is plenty to look at and think about at Christie's. The display includes more early works than have ever been exhibited in New York: a group of thick-surfaced figurative canvases and portraits from the late 1930s and early '40s that show Bess learning from van Gogh, Gauguin and Marsden Hartley.
A three-quarters portrait of a dark-haired youth with a subtly flushed neck is especially intriguing. And a large undated work, ''Untitled (Indian Dancer),'' shows him teetering clumsily and endearingly on the brink of his simpler, more concentrated later paintings. It features bright biomorphic shapes suggestive of both internal organs and footprints, and has intimations of crude maps, tire tracks and surf.
In the end this exhibition may unsettle the notions of Bess as an isolated genius, which is not such a bad thing. Whatever he saw in his dreams, he was clearly influenced by his surroundings, especially the seas and skies of the gulf and even its creatures, as indicated by a painting of a bright blue crab.
There are also moments when you sense an astute awareness of other art, including possibly Max Ernst (whose work Mr. Storr reproduces in his catalog essay), Color Field painting and Pop Art, evident in a bright postcardlike Alpine vista.
For all his talk of simply copying visions without adjustment, Bess's best efforts evince a sophisticated grasp of the physicality of paint and bare canvas that puts him very much in step with the Abstract Expressionists and other artists of his time. A galaxy surrounding a red star and a speckled multicolored planet is, if you look closely, simply raw canvas carefully mottled with different densities of black, an ingenious bit of economy.
One of my favorite works, shunted to the end of a long wall as if not quite part of the show, is a late one, from 1967: a strange four-part palisade outlined in black on raw canvas with a vivid blue sky overhead. With each bluff of canvas highlighted by vigorous, overlapping vertical pulls of magenta, orange and brown, it has a combination of rawness and fluidity that makes you wonder what Bess might have done if his health had held up.
By 1967 he had endured the destruction of his beachside shack at Chinquapin by Hurricane Carla and moved some 20 miles inland to Bay City, Tex., his birthplace. In Mr. Smith's film one of Bess's friends says that he sometimes spoke of committing suicide, which he said he intended to accomplish by drinking. But before he could do that, he was partly incapacitated by a stroke and ultimately died of skin cancer.
It is possible to imagine other ways than an auction house exhibition for the Burkhart collection to reach public view, most obviously through a commercial gallery with some experience in Bess's work. But the Anderson Center's fiduciary responsibility is to get as much money from its windfall as possible, which Christie's is likely to pull off.
The most recent Bess to be sold at auction went for $112,000 at Sotheby's in New York last fall. The paintings at Christie's are priced from $100,000 to $300,000 each, with most in the $200,000-to-$250,000 range. This sounds like a bit of a markup, but it is probably small potatoes when you consider some of the absurd prices paid for new works by contemporary artists.
Amy Cappellazzo, who is overseeing the Bess exhibition and sales, said that the paintings are being carefully placed, and that several institutions have expressed interest. As with art dealers, we can only take her at her word and hope to see some of these works again soon under less profit-driven circumstances.
''A Tribute to Forrest Bess'' is on view through April 11 at Christie's, 1230 Avenue of the Americas, at 49th Street; (212) 636-2000. The Whitney Biennial 2012 runs through May 27 at the Whitney Museum of American Art; whitney.org.

HEADLINE: U.S. Inches Toward Goal Of Energy Independence

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and ERIC LIPTON; Clifford Krauss reported from Midland, Tex., and Houston and Eric Lipton reported from Washington and San Diego. John M. Broder contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
MIDLAND, Tex. -- The desolate stretch of West Texas desert known as the Permian Basin is still the lonely domain of scurrying roadrunners by day and howling coyotes by night. But the roar of scores of new oil rigs and the distinctive acrid fumes of drilling equipment are unmistakable signs that crude is gushing again.
And not just here. Across the country, the oil and gas industry is vastly increasing production, reversing two decades of decline. Using new technology and spurred by rising oil prices since the mid-2000s, the industry is extracting millions of barrels more a week, from the deepest waters of the Gulf of Mexico to the prairies of North Dakota.
At the same time, Americans are pumping significantly less gasoline. While that is partly a result of the recession and higher gasoline prices, people are also driving fewer miles and replacing older cars with more fuel-efficient vehicles at a greater clip, federal data show. 
Taken together, the increasing production and declining consumption have unexpectedly brought the United States markedly closer to a goal that has tantalized presidents since Richard Nixon: independence from foreign energy sources, a milestone that could reconfigure American foreign policy, the economy and more. In 2011, the country imported just 45 percent of the liquid fuels it used, down from a record high of 60 percent in 2005.
''There is no question that many national security policy makers will believe they have much more flexibility and will think about the world differently if the United States is importing a lot less oil,'' said Michael A. Levi, an energy and environmental senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''For decades, consumption rose, production fell and imports increased, and now every one of those trends is going the other way.''
How the country made this turnabout is a story of industry-friendly policies started by President Bush and largely continued by President Obama -- many over the objections of environmental advocates -- as well as technological advances that have allowed the extraction of oil and gas once considered too difficult and too expensive to reach. But mainly it is a story of the complex economics of energy, which sometimes seems to operate by its own rules of supply and demand.
With gasoline prices now approaching record highs and politicians mud-wrestling about the causes and solutions, the effects of the longer-term rise in production can be difficult to see.
Simple economics suggests that if the nation is producing more energy, prices should be falling. But crude oil -- and gasoline and diesel made from it -- are global commodities whose prices are affected by factors around the world. Supply disruptions in Africa, the political standoff with Iran and rising demand from a recovering world economy all are contributing to the current spike in global oil prices, offsetting the impact of the increased domestic supply.
But the domestic trends are unmistakable. Not only has the United States reduced oil imports from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries by more than 20 percent in the last three years, it has become a net exporter of refined petroleum products like gasoline for the first time since the Truman presidency. The natural gas industry, which less than a decade ago feared running out of domestic gas, is suddenly dealing with a glut so vast that import facilities are applying for licenses to export gas to Europe and Asia.
National oil production, which declined steadily to 4.95 million barrels a day in 2008 from 9.6 million in 1970, has risen over the last four years to nearly 5.7 million barrels a day. The Energy Department projects that daily output could reach nearly seven million barrels by 2020. Some experts think it could eventually hit 10 million barrels -- which would put the United States in the same league as Saudi Arabia.
This surge is hardly without consequences. Some areas of intense drilling activity, including northeastern Utah and central Wyoming, have experienced air quality problems. The drilling technique called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which uses highly pressurized water, sand and chemical lubricants that help force more oil and gas from rock formations, has also been blamed for wastewater problems. Wildlife experts also warn that expanded drilling is threatening habitats of rare or endangered species.
Greater energy independence is ''a prize that has long been eyed by oil insiders and policy strategists that can bring many economic and national security benefits,'' said Jay Hakes, a senior official at the Energy Department during the Clinton administration. ''But we will have to work through the environmental issues, which are a definite challenge.''
The increased production of fossil fuels is a far cry from the energy plans President Obama articulated as a candidate in 2008. Then, he promoted policies to help combat global warming, including vast investments in renewable energy and a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions that would have discouraged the use of fossil fuels.
More recently, with gasoline prices rising and another election looming, Mr. Obama has struck a different chord. He has opened new federal lands and waters to drilling, trumpeted increases in oil and gas production and de-emphasized the challenges of climate change. On Thursday, he said he supported expedited construction of the southern portion of the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada.
Mr. Obama's current policy has alarmed many environmental advocates who say he has failed to adequately address the environmental threats of expanded drilling and the use of fossil fuels. He also has not silenced critics, including Republicans and oil executives, who accuse him of preventing drilling on millions of acres off the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts and on federal land, unduly delaying the decision on the full Keystone project and diverting scarce federal resources to pie-in-the-sky alternative energy programs.
Just as the production increase was largely driven by rising oil prices, the trend could reverse if the global economy were to slow. Even so, much of the industry is thrilled at the prospects.
''To not be concerned with where our oil is going to come from is probably the biggest home run for the country in a hundred years,'' said Scott D. Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, which is operating in West Texas. ''It sort of reminds me of the industrial revolution in coal, which allowed us to have some of the cheapest energy in the world and drove our economy in the late 1800s and 1900s.''
The Foundation Is Laid
For as long as roughnecks have worked the Permian Basin -- made famous during World War II as the fuel pump that powered the Allies -- they have mostly focused on relatively shallow zones of easily accessible, oil-soaked sandstone and silt. But after 80 years of pumping, those regions were running dry.
So in 2003, Jim Henry, a West Texas oilman, tried a bold experiment. Borrowing an idea from a fellow engineer, his team at Henry Petroleum drilled deep into a hard limestone formation using a refinement of fracking. By blasting millions of gallons of water into the limestone, they created tiny fissures that allowed oil to break free, a technique that had previously been successful in extracting gas from shale.
The test produced 150 barrels of oil a day, three times more than normal. ''We knew we had the biggest discovery in over 50 years in the Permian Basin,'' Mr. Henry recalled.
There was just one problem: At $30 a barrel, the price of oil was about half of what was needed to make drilling that deep really profitable.
So the renaissance of the Permian -- and the domestic oil industry -- would have to wait.
But the drillers in Texas had important allies in Washington. President Bush grew up in Midland and spent 11 years as a West Texas oilman, albeit without much success, before entering politics. Vice President Dick Cheney had been chief executive of the oil field contractor Halliburton. The Bush administration worked from the start on finding ways to unlock the nation's energy reserves and reverse decades of declining output, with Mr. Cheney leading a White House energy task force that met in secret with top oil executives.
''Ramping up production was a high priority,'' said Gale Norton, a member of the task force and the secretary of the Interior at the time. ''We hated being at the mercy of other countries, and we were determined to change that.''
The task force's work helped produce the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which set rules that contributed to the current surge. It prohibited the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating fracking under the Safe Drinking Water Act, eliminating a potential impediment to wide use of the technique. The legislation also offered the industry billions of dollars in new tax breaks to help independent producers recoup some drilling costs even when a well came up dry.
Separately, the Interior Department was granted the power to issue drilling permits on millions of acres of federal lands without extensive environmental impact studies for individual projects, addressing industry complaints about the glacial pace of approvals. That new power has been used at least 8,400 times, mostly in Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico, representing a quarter of all permits issued on federal land in the last six federal fiscal years.
The Bush administration also opened large swaths of the Gulf of Mexico and the waters off Alaska to exploration, granting lease deals that required companies to pay only a tiny share of their profits to the government.
These measures primed the pump for the burst in drilling that began once oil prices started rising sharply in 2005 and 2006. With the world economy humming -- and China, India and other developing nations posting astonishing growth -- demand for oil began outpacing the easily accessible supplies.
By 2008, daily global oil consumption surged to 86 million barrels, up nearly 20 percent from the decade before. In July of that year, the price of oil reached its highest level since World War II, topping $145 a barrel (equivalent to more than $151 a barrel in today's dollars).
Oil reserves once too difficult and expensive to extract -- including Mr. Henry's limestone fields -- had become more attractive.
If money was the motivation, fracking became the favored means of extraction.
While fracking itself had been around for years, natural gas drillers in the 1980s and 1990s began combining high-pressure fracking with drilling wells horizontally, not just vertically. They found it unlocked gas from layers of shale previously seen as near worthless.
By 2001, fracking took off around Fort Worth and Dallas, eventually reaching under schools, airports and inner-city neighborhoods. Companies began buying drilling rights across vast shale fields in a variety of states. By 2008, the country was awash in natural gas.
Fracking for oil, which is made of larger molecules than natural gas, took longer to develop. But eventually, it opened new oil fields in North Dakota, South Texas, Kansas, Wyoming, Colorado and, most recently, Ohio.
Meanwhile, technological advances were making deeper oil drilling possible in the Gulf of Mexico. New imaging and seismic technology allowed engineers to predict the location and size of reservoirs once obscured by thick layers of salt. And drill bits made of superstrong alloys were developed to withstand the hot temperatures and high pressures deep under the seabed.
As the industry's confidence -- and profits -- grew, so did criticism. Amid concerns about global warming and gasoline prices that averaged a record $4.11 a gallon in July 2008 ($4.30 in today's dollars), President Obama campaigned on a pledge to shift toward renewable energy and away from fossil fuels.
His administration initially canceled some oil and gas leases on federal land awarded during the Bush administration and required more environmental review. But in a world where crucial oil suppliers like Venezuela and Libya were unstable and high energy prices could be a drag on a weak economy, he soon acted to promote more drilling. Despite a drilling hiatus after the 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 rig workers and spilled millions of barrels of crude oil into the ocean, he has proposed expansion of oil production both on land and offshore. He is now moving toward approving drilling off the coast of Alaska.
''Our dependence on foreign oil is down because of policies put in place by our administration, but also our predecessor's administration,'' Mr. Obama said during a campaign appearance in March, a few weeks after opening 38 million more acres in the gulf for oil and gas exploration. ''And whoever succeeds me is going to have to keep it up.''
An American Oil Boom
The last time the Permian Basin oil fields enjoyed a boom -- nearly three decades ago -- Rolls-Royce opened a showroom in the desert, Champagne was poured from cowboy boots, and the local airport could not accommodate all the Learjets taking off for Las Vegas on weekends.
But when crude prices fell in the mid-1980s, oil companies pulled out and the Rolls dealership was replaced by a tortilla factory. The only thriving business was done by bankruptcy lawyers and auctioneers helping to unload used Ferraris, empty homes and useless rigs.
''One day we were rolling in oil,'' recalled Jim Foreman, the general manager of the Midland BMW dealership, ''and the next day geologists were flipping burgers at McDonald's.''
The burger-flipping days are definitely over. Today, more than 475 rigs -- roughly a quarter of all rigs operating in the United States -- are smashing through tight rocks across the Permian in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. Those areas are already producing nearly a million barrels a day, or 17 percent more than two years ago. By decade's end, that daily total could easily double, oil executives say, roughly equaling the total output of Nigeria.
''We're having a revolution,'' said G. Steven Farris, chief executive of Apache Corporation, one of the basin's most active producers. ''And we're just scratching the surface.''
It is a revolution that is returning investments to the United States. Over several decades, Pioneer Natural Resources had taken roughly $1 billion earned in Texas oil fields and drilled in Africa, South America and elsewhere. But in the last five years, the company sold $2 billion of overseas assets and reinvested in Texas shale fields.
''Political risk was increasing internationally,'' said Mr. Sheffield, Pioneer's chief executive, and domestically, he was encouraged to see ''the shale technology progressing.''
Pioneer's rising fortunes can be seen on a 10,000-acre field known as the Giddings Estate, a forsaken stretch inhabited by straggly coyotes, rabbits, rattlesnakes and cows that forage for grass between the sagebrush. When Pioneer bought it in 2005, the field's hundred mostly broken-down wells were producing a total of 50 barrels a day. ''It was a diamond in the rough,'' said Robert Hillger, who manages it for Pioneer.
Mr. Hillger and his colleagues have brought an array of new tools to bear at Giddings. Computer programs simulate well designs, minimizing trial and error. Advanced fiber optics allow senior engineers and geologists at headquarters more than 300 miles away to monitor progress and remotely direct the drill bit. Subterranean microphones help identify fissures in the rock to plan subsequent drilling.
Today, the Giddings field is pumping 7,000 barrels a day, and Pioneer expects to hit 25,000 barrels a day by 2017.
The newfound wealth is spreading beyond the fields. In nearby towns, petroleum companies are buying so many pickup trucks that dealers are leasing parking lots the size of city blocks to stock their inventory. Housing is in such short supply that drillers are importing contractors from Houston and hotels are leased out before they are even built.
Two new office buildings are going up in Midland, a city of just over 110,000 people, the first in 30 years, while the total value of downtown real estate has jumped 50 percent since 2008. With virtually no unemployment, restaurants cannot find enough servers. Local truck drivers are making six-figure salaries.
''Anybody who comes in with a driver's license and a Social Security card, I'll give him a chance,'' said Rusty Allred, owner of Rusty's Oilfield Service Company.
If there is a loser in this boom, it is the environment. Water experts say aquifers in the desert area could run dry if fracking continues expanding, and oil executives concede they need to reduce water consumption. Yet environmental concerns, from polluted air to greenhouse gas emissions, have gained little traction in the Permian Basin or other outposts of the energy expansion.
On the front lines in opposition is Jay Lininger, a 36-year-old ecologist who drives through the Permian in an old Toyota Tacoma with a hard hat tilted on his head and a federal land map at the ready.
A former national park firefighter, he says he is now battling a wildfire of a different sort -- the oil industry.
Nationally, environmentalists have challenged drilling with mixed results. Efforts to stop or slow fracking have succeeded in New York State and some localities in other states, but it is spreading across the country.
In the Permian, Mr. Lininger said, few people openly object to the foul-smelling air of the oil fields. Ranchers are more than happy to sell what water they have to the oil companies for fracking.
Mr. Lininger and his group are trying to slow the expansion of drilling by appealing to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to protect several animal species, including the five-inch dunes sagebrush lizard.
''It's a pathetic little lizard in an ugly desert, but life needs to be protected,'' he said. ''Every day we burn fossil fuel makes it harder for our planet to recover from our energy addiction.''
Mr. Lininger said the oil and ranching industries had already destroyed or fragmented 40 percent of the lizard's habitat, and 60 percent of what is left is under lease for oil and gas development.
The wildlife agency proposed listing the lizard as endangered in 2010 and was expected to decide last December, but Congressional representatives from the oil patch won a delay. Oil companies are working on a voluntary program to locate new drilling so it will not disturb the lizard habitat.
But for Mr. Lininger's group, the Center for Biological Diversity, that is far from sufficient.
Brendan Cummings, senior counsel of the center, said protecting the lizard was part of a broader effort to keep drilling from harming animals, including polar bears, walruses and bowhead whales in the Alaskan Arctic and dwarf sea horses and sea turtles in the Gulf of Mexico.
''When you are dealing with fossil fuels, things will always go wrong,'' Mr. Cummings said. ''There will always be spills, there will always be pollution. Those impacts compound the fragmentation that occurs and render these habitats into sacrifice areas.''
A Turn Toward Efficiency
If the Permian Basin exemplifies the rise in production, car-obsessed San Diego is a prime example of the other big factor in the decline in the nation's reliance on foreign oil.
Just since 2007, consumption of all liquid fuels in the United States, including diesel, jet fuel and heating oil, has dropped by about 9 percent, according to the Energy Department. Gasoline use fell 6 to 12 percent, estimated Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service.
Although Southern California's love affair with muscle cars and the open road persists, driving habits have changed in subtle but important ways.
Take Tory Girten, who works as an emergency medical technician and part-time lifeguard in the San Diego area. He switched from driving a Ford minivan to a decidedly smaller and more fuel-efficient Dodge Caliber. Fed up with high gasoline prices, he also moved twice recently to be closer to the city center, cutting his daily commute considerably -- a hint of the shift taking place in certain metropolitan areas as city centers become more popular while growth in far-out suburbs slows.
''I would rather pay a little more monthly for rent than for just filling up my tank with gas,'' he said, after pulling into a local gas station to fill up.
Mr. Girten is one of millions of Americans who have downsized. S.U.V.'s accounted for 18 percent of new-car sales in 2002, but only 7 percent in 2010.
The surge in gasoline prices nationwide -- they are already at a record level for this time of year -- has contributed to the shift toward more fuel-efficient cars. But a bigger factor is rising federal fuel economy standards. After a long freeze, the miles-per-gallon mandate has been increased several times in recent years, with the Obama administration now pushing automakers to hit 54.5 m.p.g. by 2025.
As Americans replace their older cars -- they have bought an average of 1.25 million new cars and light trucks a month this year -- new technologies mean they usually end up with a more efficient vehicle, even if they buy a model of similar size and power.
California has long pushed further and faster toward efficiency than the rest of the country. It has combated often severe air pollution by mandating cleaner-burning cars, including all-electric vehicles, and prodded Washington to increase the fuel efficiency standards.
Thousands of school buses, trash trucks, tractor-trailers and street sweepers and public transit buses in the state run on natural gas, which is cheaper than gasoline and burns more cleanly. That switch cuts the consumption of foreign oil, as does the corn-based ethanol that is now mixed into gasoline as a result of federal mandates.
Longer-term social and economic factors are also reducing miles driven -- like the rise in Internet shopping and telecommuting and the tendency of baby boomers to drive less as they age. The recession has also contributed, as job losses have meant fewer daily commutes and falling home prices have allowed some people to afford to move closer to work.
The trend of lower consumption, when combined with higher energy production, has profound implications, said Bill White, former deputy energy secretary in the Clinton administration and former mayor of Houston.
''Energy independence has always been a race between depletion and technologies to produce more and use energy more efficiently,'' he said. ''Depletion was winning for decades, and now technology is starting to overtake its lead.''

HEADLINE: An Urbane and Unexpected Leap From West to East

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

 BODY:
Japanese Art Deco sounds like an oxymoron. Rightly or wrongly, we -- we Americans, that is -- are likely to envision the Japanese in the 1920s and '30s as almost entirely focused on militarism and expansionism. Yet, as an exhibition at Japan Society proves, there were more than enough time and resources in that era for Japanese artists, designers and consumers to cultivate their own version of Art Deco, that excruciatingly suave Western style of art, design and decor.
This beautiful and sociologically intriguing show, ''Deco Japan: Shaping Art and Culture, 1920-1945'' displays about 200 objects, including painting, sculpture, ceramics, glassware, jewelry, fashion and printed ephemera, almost all of them from the collection of Robert and Mary Levenson of Clearwater, Fla. (There are also five paintings on loan from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.) 
What is striking about almost everything in the show is how seamlessly East and West and old and new are wed. An uninformed visitor could be forgiven for believing that the Japanese invented Art Deco. And, in a way, that viewer would not be wrong. Japonisme, the European fad for all things Japanese that took hold in the latter half of the 19th century, decisively influenced Western aesthetics in both the fine and applied arts. The Japanese love of formal economy and technical transparency is in the DNA of European Deco, so when Japanese artists and designers looked Westward in the 1920s, what they saw was not as foreign as you might have thought.
Some objects in the exhibition blend tradition and innovation so adeptly that it would be hard, without context, to guess in what century they were made. The glossy red lacquer surface of a gracefully bulbous vase by Iriyama Hakuo from the 1930s is incised with concentric lines revealing tan, brown and green under layers and creating bold diamond and triangular shapes. The technique is thoroughly traditional, and while the composition reflects a modern love of futuristic abstraction, it also harks back to centuries of play with geometric form by Japanese craftsmen.
The leap from old to new is more obvious in many cases, but it is never jarring. An irresistibly charming piece of fine silver work, an incense burner in the form of a fat little bird, by Jomi, has a rounded body that Brancusi, the European Modernist, would have envied. Angular wings and a tail with vents for the aromatic smoke add a mechanical aspect. The catalog identifies this diminutive creature, with its open, upturned beak as the ''plump sparrow,'' an emblem of good fortune derived from an old folk tale.
Two other birds, cranes by Nakamura Kenji (also known as Chikueido Eishin II), are represented as planar constructions mimicking the ancient art of origami. Embodied in gleaming silver rather than paper -- one of them gilt to a golden hue -- they could be hood ornaments for sleek modern automobiles.
The exhibition presents a veritable menagerie of animals: lions, bears, peacocks, rabbits and flying fish, as well as mythical fauna like dragons, phoenixes and flying horses. Whether in two or three dimensions, naturalism is invariably modified by abstraction. Some pieces lean toward minimalistic simplification; some are faceted, Cubist style; and some emphasize flowing lines.
There might be simple nostalgia in these zoological works, but the modernized animal also suggests a more complicated metaphor. Art Deco was nothing if not urban and urbane -- euphorically so. More than just a style, it was newness itself, in an eclectic array of seductively material forms. But maybe, under the glitzy surfaces of modernity's artificial paradise, there was anxiety about the loss of connection to nature. Perhaps the Art Deco bestiary was a form of consolation for that loss.
A section of the show is devoted to the modern woman, one who enjoys a liberation paralleling that of her Jazz Age sisters in America and Europe. In numerous paintings and sculptures, women dance, drink, smoke, relax in states of near nudity and otherwise revel in hedonistic freedom that recalls the old, Edo-period district of pleasurable pursuits known as the Floating World. A gauzy watercolor picturing men and women in fancy Western dress dancing in a nightclub, believed to be by either Toyoharu or Yamamura Toyonari, could be mistaken for a painting of nocturnal life in Manhattan by Charles Demuth.
In a large painting rendered in delicate shades of jade-green ink by Enomoto Chikatoshi, a young woman in a sensible, Western-style dress gazes through the window of a public aquarium at swimming fish. A wall of glass separates her from the primordial cycles of nature to which tradition used to confine her essential being.
The idealization of this new, independent femininity can be seen as an imaginary compensation for what industry and commerce were more often doing: turning people into cogs in the machinery of mass production and distribution. That was the dark side of the happy, Deco moon.
In his catalog essay Kendall H. Brown, the exhibition's organizer and a scholar of modern Japanese art, notes even deeper shadows. Although seemingly apolitical in its luxurious sensuality, Japanese Deco was rife with symbols of patriotism and imperialistic ambition. Dragons, bulls, phoenixes and rising suns that look innocuous to a Western viewer today were understood then to represent Japan's emergence as an industrial and military giant. Mr. Brown identifies eight Japanese aircraft carriers named after dragons or phoenixes plying the seas in the 1940s.
Art Deco fell from grace in post-World War II Japan. In the 1950s, Mr. Brown observes, its association with ''the 'dark valley' of cultural decadence and militant nationalism'' made it seem not only old-fashioned but also shameful. That explains at least partly why Japanese Deco has been practically unknown in the West. To retrieve it from the memory hole now is not to absolve it of all sin but to see it for what it was: a fascinating episode in the adventure of modern aesthetics.
''Deco Japan: Shaping Art and Culture, 1920-1945'' is on view through June 10 at Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan; (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org.

HEADLINE: U.S. Report Sees Tensions Over Water

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The American intelligence community warned in a report released Thursday that problems with water could destabilize countries in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia over the next decade. 
Increasing demand and competition caused by the world's rising population and scarcities created by climate change and poor management threaten to disrupt economies and increase regional tensions, the report concludes.
Prepared at the request of the State Department, the report is based on a classified National Intelligence Estimate completed last October that reflected an increasing focus on environmental and other factors that threaten security. An estimate reflects the consensus judgment of all intelligence agencies.
While the report concluded that wars over water are unlikely in the coming decade, it said that countries could use water for political and economic leverage over neighbors and that major facilities like dams and desalination plants could become targets of terrorist attacks. Coupled with poverty and other social factors, problems with water could even contribute to the political failure of weaker nations.
The public report, unlike the classified version, did not specify countries at greatest risk for water-related disruption but analyzed conditions on major river basins in regions with high potential for conflict -- from the Jordan to the Tigris and Euphrates to the Brahmaputra in South Asia.
''During the next 10 years, many countries important to the United States will almost certainly experience water problems -- shortages, poor water quality, or floods -- that will contribute to the risk of instability and state failure, and increase regional tensions,'' the report said. ''Additionally states will focus on addressing internal water-related social disruptions which will distract them from working with the United States on important policy objectives.''
The report warned that water shortages would become acute in some regions within the next decade, as demand continued to rise. While disputes over water have historically led to negotiated settlements over access, upstream countries will increasingly use dams and other projects ''to obtain regional influence or preserve their water interests'' over weaker countries downstream.
This is already happening on the Tigris and Euphrates, where Turkey, Syria and Iran have harnessed the headwaters of the two rivers that flow through Iraq.
The release was timed to the announcement by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton of a partnership to promote conservation and improved management in conjunction with corporations like Coca-Cola and Ford and nongovernmental organizations like the Nature Conservancy.
The report said that improvements in management -- like the use of drip irrigation systems -- could ease the potential for shortages, especially in agriculture, which accounts for 70 percent of the world's water use.

HEADLINE: The Electoral Math Of Romney's Stance On Trade With China

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Among all the elements of Mitt Romney's 59-point economic plan, his vow to crack down on China's trade policy would seem the most out of place.
That is not because his promise to label China a ''currency manipulator'' and impose tariff penalties is unique. Plenty of politicians in both parties talk tough about Beijing.
What is unusual is that Mr. Romney, a former financial executive identified with Republicans' free-trade, pro-business wing, has promised to go further than Presidents Obama or George W. Bush in confronting China. Some other business-friendly Republicans warn that his approach could set off a counterproductive trade war that would damage the United States economy. 
The political question is whether Mr. Romney's stance can attract enough votes to give him the chance to put it into effect. That question echoes through Republican primaries, in which he has struggled to connect with working-class conservatives, and a possible general election against Mr. Obama.
Republican and Democratic strategists alike say that confronting China can play effectively to an anxious public's sense of economic grievance. The Obama administration has recently lodged a complaint with the World Trade Organization against China's handling of crucial rare earth mineral exports, and imposed tariffs on Chinese solar panels to counter what it considers unfair subsidies by Beijing.
''With blue-collar voters specifically, there's a perception that we have an economic adversary in China that doesn't play by the rules,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. And the concern ''cuts across socioeconomic lines,'' said Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster, who said higher-income voters fear that China's ownership of United States government debt threatens American security.
Yet prominent figures who generally share Mr. Romney's economic outlook have criticized his stance, which the Wall Street Journal editorial page called ''Romney's China Blunder.'' Business leaders, while pressing for China to open its markets and protect intellectual property, caution that labeling China a currency manipulator could backfire, harming those efforts.
Jon M. Huntsman Jr., who was ambassador to China before embarking on his failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination, accused Mr. Romney of ''total pandering'' on the issue before exiting the race and endorsing him. Rick Santorum, now competing with Mr. Romney for blue-collar votes, has taken a similar view.
''We all know Mitt Romney will do and say anything to get votes,'' said Hogan Gidley, Mr. Santorum's communications director.
Mr. Obama's advisers called Mr. Romney's stance hypocritical. A Romney family blind trust owns a stake in an investment fund established by his former company, Bain Capital, that has bought a Chinese video surveillance company. And in his 2010 book, ''No Apology,'' Mr. Romney criticized Mr. Obama for levying a trade complaint against Chinese tire exports. Accusing Mr. Obama of acting to reward union supporters, he wrote, ''Protectionism stifles productivity.''
Mr. Romney's China currency stance ''is about as authentic as his brief flirtation with cheesy grits,'' said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's top political strategist. ''When you build a career around outsourcing, slashing jobs and wages, and profiting handsomely off of bankrupting companies, I don't think people are going to be moved by what is an obvious election-year conversion.''
One Romney adviser, Vin Weber, initially wondered whether the position reflected political calculation. When he joined internal discussions about Mr. Romney's forthcoming economic plan last year, Mr. Weber said he sought to persuade other economic advisers to abandon the promised currency crackdown, which he still considers a policy mistake. Soon Mr. Weber was making that case directly to the candidate -- who rejected the appeal and insisted his policy is the right one.
''This is directly from him,'' said Mr. Weber, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican congressman from Minnesota. ''He believes it will strengthen his hand substantially. Mitt Romney is a person who sees himself as a successful negotiator.''
Underpinning Mr. Romney's argument is his assertion that recent presidents of both parties have been ''played like a fiddle'' by Chinese leaders. By keeping the yuan's value lower against the dollar than market forces would dictate, Beijing makes exports to the United States cheaper and imports from the United States more expensive. In a Republican debate last year, Mr. Romney said China's interest in smooth relations with a mammoth customer like the United States would preclude his actions from backfiring.
''You think they want to have a trade war?'' Mr. Romney said. ''If you are not willing to stand up to China, you will get run over by China, and that's what's happened for 20 years.''
That assertion grates on veterans of the Bush administration, which in 2006 began a ''strategic economic dialogue'' with China led by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., a former chairman of Goldman Sachs. The Obama administration has extended that dialogue, pressing Beijing to raise the value of the yuan while stopping short of declaring China a currency manipulator.
''Both the Bush and Obama administrations have been as aggressive as possible while protecting the American people,'' said Neel T. Kashkari, a Bush administration Treasury official now at Pimco, the giant bond-trading firm. ''Launching a trade war with China would hurt us as much as it would hurt them.''
Mr. Romney's economic plan makes it sounds as if he is willing to take that risk. It lists the currency crackdown among five executive orders he pledges to issue on ''Day 1'' of his presidency.
But a close reading of the language suggests he has left himself an out. It pledges to label China a currency manipulator ''if China does not quickly move to float its currency.''
China has already been raising the value of its currency against the dollar somewhat in recent years, including by 4.7 percent in 2011. Some experts on China policy predict a President Romney would find a way to sidestep his pledge once electioneering gave way to governance.
''It is a campaign, after all,'' said Nicholas R. Lardy, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ''My forecast is that if Romney becomes president there will be little or no change in our China policy.''

HEADLINE: When Campaigns Change Course, Some of Their Ads Are Never Seen

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Modern campaigns are often scientifically plotted operations that leave little to chance. Nowhere is this more obvious than with advertising, which is carefully fashioned from polling, focus groups and demographic research.
But sometimes even the best-laid plans go awry. Consider the story of Ben Stein, George W. Bush and the commercial that never aired.
Late in the summer of 2000, Mr. Bush's campaign strategists saw their position in the polls improving and got a little cocky. They arranged for Mr. Stein, a comedian and former speechwriter for Richard M. Nixon, to reprise his breakout role as the economics teacher in the film ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off'' for a commercial mocking Al Gore.
''Who said he and Tipper were the models for 'Love Story'?'' Mr. Stein asked his ''students,'' repeating one of several tales about Mr. Gore that helped stoke his reputation as a serial embellisher. ''Who said he created the Internet? Anyone? Anyone?'' 
The commercials, which were never released, were cut and ready to be broadcast. But then Mr. Gore started to surge in national polls. The Bush campaign killed the ads, fearful that the timing was wrong.
''The campaign had lost its confident footing,'' said Mark McKinnon, who directed Mr. Bush's advertising efforts in 2000 and 2004. A risky ad that could backfire, he said, was the last thing most Bush strategists wanted. ''Maybe they were right,'' he said. ''After all, we won. But as the creative guy, it killed me.''
Every presidential campaign has commercials that are relegated to the dustbin before they are broadcast. Sometimes, after a second look, the message seems not quite right. Other times, new developments can intervene, forcing a shift in political tactics. And occasionally, the boss just says no.
Mr. Gore's senior strategists vetoed a mock music video titled ''The Ballad of George W. Bush.'' The campaign had been having difficulty gaining traction in the South, so it decided to try a country song lampooning Mr. Bush as a privileged loafer.
Mark Putnam, who worked on Mr. Gore's ads at the time, wrote the lyrics. ''Life is pretty easy when your dad's the man/Beats working for a livin', it's the George Bush plan,'' went one verse. The campaign signed off and production began.
Filming it was an enormous undertaking for a political ad. Twenty cast and crew members, including Martin Delray and the Tennessee Rockers, 20 vehicles and a camel were gathered at a Texas ranch. The video was edited and ready to go on the air. Then some on Mr. Gore's team got cold feet.
''I've always said if we could have swung 500 votes in the Florida Panhandle with this thing, Al Gore would be president of the United States,'' Mr. Putnam said.
Tremendous amounts of research can go into making and refining political ads. Many campaigns show them to small audiences before they are broadcast, revising and tweaking language that people object to. Sometimes the testing is done in focus-group settings in which a moderator leads a discussion about what people found appealing or unappealing. Other times the testing is more anonymous, with voters given a dial that they flip back and forth to signal approval or disapproval as they watch.
Then the content of the ads is meticulously checked for accuracy. If a campaign is using man-on-the-street interviews with random voters, it will research the backgrounds of those voters. If there are red flags -- which are hardly unheard of -- the ad may have to be scrapped.
''Sometimes the facts don't check out, or the person you filmed to do a spot had some issues in their past,'' said Chris Mottola, who has created ads for the campaigns of Mr. Bush and John McCain. ''Sometimes what you think is a good story turns out to be not such a good story.''
It is fairly routine for ads to get spiked in the research and fact-checking processes. But an ad can also be shelved after all that work is done and it is ready to go on the air.
The media team working for Edward M. Kennedy, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, had that experience when it created a series of ads attacking Mr. Kennedy's challenger in 1994, Mitt Romney, who at the time was known primarily as a prominent Massachusetts businessman. One of the harshest spots, which does not sound all that different from what Mr. Romney's opponents in the Republican presidential race are saying about him today, was never broadcast.
''Mitt Romney says he saved Bain & Company,'' the announcer says. ''But he didn't tell you that on the day he took over, he had his predecessor fire hundreds of employees. Or that the way the company was rescued was with a federal bailout.''
The ad includes a point-by-point -- if highly selective -- recitation of events in the company's past. A government loan, failed repayment, a $4 million Bain profit.
It concludes: ''Mitt Romney, maybe he's just against government when it helps working men and women.''
The spot was prepared as part of a series of negative commercials intended to raise Mr. Kennedy's falling poll numbers. But the other ads had evidently done their job, and Mr. Kennedy regained his lead. His campaign decided the Bain ad was no longer necessary.
''It was going to run at the end'' of the campaign, said Tad Devine, a Kennedy strategist and veteran Democratic consultant. ''But we were like 18 points ahead, so we said: 'Forget it. Close positive.' ''
Debates inside campaigns about whether to go negative and how aggressively to do so have killed some ads deemed too harsh for the airwaves. During the 2008 campaign, Mr. McCain's advisers debated attacking Barack Obama for his association with the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., the Chicago pastor who had uttered remarks hostile to America. Some thought such an attack on the first black nominee from a major party would be too racially charged.
But Fred Davis, a seasoned adman who has made commercials for Mr. Bush and many other leading Republicans, went ahead and produced a 30-second spot that used Mr. Wright's infamous rant -- ''God damn America!'' -- juxtaposed with tales of Mr. McCain's war heroism. Hoping to convince Mr. McCain that the commercial would present a clear contrast with Mr. Obama, Mr. Davis paid for the ad out of his own pocket.
''I kept pushing, but I didn't get anywhere,'' Mr. Davis said. ''He said no way.''

HEADLINE: Tax Policy: Much Talk, Few Details

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
If approached the right way, there could actually be some widespread agreement on tax reform coming out of the current election.
''The tax code has become a broken maze of complexity and political favoritism, overgrown with special-interest loopholes,'' said Representative Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, this week in a budget plan that was long on rhetoric and short on specifics. He said he wanted to lower corporate and individual rates while eliminating loopholes.
I suspect you could get an overwhelming majority of legislators to agree with both the diagnosis and the prescription.
Mr. Ryan was very clear on how much he wanted to lower rates, and seemed to hint that he would preserve one tax break: lower rates for unearned income including capital gains and dividends. But he is silent on what special tax breaks he would actually eliminate. 
That is a common problem with Republican proposals this year. ''They all provide the dessert before the broccoli,'' said Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center, referring to the Ryan plan and to proposals from the various Republican presidential hopefuls. ''They promise to get rid of the estate tax, the alternative minimum tax. They promise they will pay for them, but they don't tell you how.''
President Obama has been a little more forthcoming, but he appears to be just as determined to avoid serving up anything unpalatable to the vast majority of taxpayers.
''For too long, the U.S. tax code has benefited the wealthy and well-connected at the expense of the vast majority of Americans,'' states the White House Web site under the headline ''Restoring Fairness.''
''That's why President Obama has successfully fought to cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses. And it's why he has called for reforming our tax code and closing tax loopholes for millionaires and billionaires as well as hedge fund managers, private jet owners and oil companies.''
One fact you won't hear much of this year is that tax collections now are well below historic averages -- and even below what Mr. Ryan says they should be over the long term. Much of that is because of the economy, but the reality is that the government needs to collect more money, and taxing the rich is not going to be enough.
Mr. Ryan, whose spokesman did not return my phone call, asserts that his new tax plan will somehow take in as much as the government does now, but that could be true only if he attacked a lot of tax preferences dear to voters.
Many of those voters will be stunned to learn that some things they take for granted count as preferences. They know about the mortgage interest deduction and the deduction for charitable contributions, but there is also the fact that people do not have to pay taxes on the value of fringe benefits provided by their employer, like health insurance. Adding them to income would mean that some would pay more in taxes even if the rate were lower.
It is true that rates could be drastically lowered if all tax exclusions, deductions and credits were eliminated. In round numbers, they add up to $1 trillion a year. Total government revenue this year is forecast to be about $2.5 trillion, so getting rid of them, without doing anything to rates, would raise revenue about 40 percent.
The Tax Policy Center, which is nonpartisan and widely respected, tried to analyze the impact of the tax changes Mr. Ryan proposed. He would get rid of the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax. He would cut corporate taxes by seeking to tax only earnings made in the United States. He would repeal assorted other taxes. And he would cut the top individual tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent.
Mr. Williams said that, compared with current law, it appeared that over 10 years the Ryan plan would cost the government about $10 trillion before considering the unspecified loopholes he would eliminate.
Current law provides that all the ''temporary'' tax cuts and assorted benefits expire as scheduled. There is another way to measure revenue, called ''current policy,'' which assumes that the temporary cuts are really permanent. Compared with current policy, the Ryan plan would cut revenue by about $4.6 trillion.
Calculating which tax preferences would need to be eliminated to make up $10 trillion or even $4.6 trillion in losses would be difficult. That is because various tax provisions interact and, of course, lower rates mean any given benefit is worth less to the taxpayer. A $100 deduction for, say, mortgage interest or charitable donations would save taxpayers $35 if they were in the 35 percent bracket, but just $25 if the top bracket were cut to 25 percent.
In the accompanying table, I have listed a variety of things that the government counts as ''tax preferences,'' and the estimated amount that they would reduce government income in 2013. If we went to a simple tax system, with no deductions and no preferential treatment of certain types of income, these are the things that would be candidates for elimination. The figures come from the Joint Committee on Taxation's latest estimates, released in January.
By no means is that list complete, but it does include most of the major things, as well as a few small ones that I found interesting. There are, of course, a host of special breaks for various industries, which add up, and are not shown. But to lower tax rates without reducing tax revenues would require changing many of the listed things.
The next time a politician tells you about wanting to cut rates and close loopholes, ask for details. You could pull out the table, and ask which particular parts should be eliminated.
If there is to be tax reform, it seems to me that there are a few simple guidelines that should be followed.
First, the tax system should be planned to produce adequate revenue to finance the government over time, with budget deficits when the economy is weak and surpluses when it is strong. Simply coming up with a percentage of gross domestic product, as Mr. Ryan does, is not enough. Of course, cutting spending is like eliminating tax loopholes. Everyone likes the idea, as long as you don't get specific.
Second, simplicity is a virtue, for reasons beyond the obvious. Tax breaks serve to channel investment or spending into some areas for noneconomic reasons. Should the government encourage spending on low-income housing or solar energy? It would be much more efficient to avoid such tax policies and use government spending for subsidies that are deemed worthy.
There is little doubt that we would be better off now if there had never been a mortgage interest deduction, which subsidized home purchases and promoted the real estate bubble. Whether that deduction should be eliminated immediately or phased out is a different question.
Nonprofit organizations would scream loudly if anyone suggested changing the charitable deduction, but at a minimum it should be tightened. Right now, some groups that exist primarily to influence elections can offer tax deductions to their contributors.
In any case, there should be a clear understanding: If you keep a given deduction or exemption or tax credit, the overall tax rate must be higher than it would be if you eliminated the tax preference.
Everyone who does not benefit from the tax preference must pay higher taxes to enable others to take advantage of it. That may be good public policy, but it should be explicit.
Once the tax system is set, Congress should try to avoid changing it for decades. If changes are necessary, they should be permanent ones, not the ''temporary'' ones that now clutter the tax code and keep getting renewed year after year.
Could that happen? Some rhetoric from both parties makes it sound possible, although watching them in action makes the idea seem hopelessly naive.

HEADLINE: Bill to Aid Start-Ups Is Approved By Senate

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Depending on who is speaking, a bill approved by the Senate on Thursday to make it easier for small companies to raise money will either improve the economy by creating jobs or cause unwitting investors to get swindled.
The Senate voted 73 to 26 to approve the JOBS Act, whose acronym stands for Jump-start Our Business Start-ups. 
The legislation, approved overwhelmingly by the House two weeks ago, would designate a new category of ''emerging growth'' companies that could conduct initial public offerings of stock while being exempt from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years.
In addition, the measure would provide a new form of financing to small companies. Through crowd-funding, or the sale of small amounts of stock to many individuals, companies could solicit equity investments through the Internet or elsewhere, raising up to $1 million annually without being required to register the shares for public trading with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
''This will make it easier for small and growing companies to raise the capital they need to keep growing and to hire more workers,'' Senator Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, said after the vote.
Until now, ''we've made it more expensive to go public in this country and done nothing to make it easier to raise capital privately,'' he added. ''This bill addresses both.''
Because the Senate made several amendments to the House bill, the package will be sent back to the House to work out differences. House Republican leaders said Thursday that they expected to take up the amended bill next week and hoped to send it quickly to President Obama, who has said he will sign it.
Some Democrats, who made up all the opposing votes to the bill, and consumer-advocacy organizations were less optimistic about the effect of a law that rolls back regulations on corporate financial disclosure. Pension funds, lobbying organizations like AARP and the chairwoman of the S.E.C. have also opposed the bill.
''Hasty deregulation has repeatedly been the source of financial crises -- the savings and loan crisis, the Enron-era crisis and the Great Recession of 2008, to name a few,'' said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who voted against the measure after his effort to substitute a rewritten bill failed earlier this week. ''I believe history will judge this misnamed bill quite harshly.''
Under the JOBS bill, companies with up to $1 billion in annual revenue would be free to ignore -- for their first five years as a public company -- regulations that were put into place after the end of the dot-com bubble and the collapse of Enron. Among them are requirements to hire an independent outside auditor to attest to a company's internal financial controls, and restrictions on how financial analysts interact with investment bankers in promoting a company's stock.
The bill also allows some companies to advertise for investors in almost any medium, a provision that skeptical regulators contend will mainly benefit the sale of worthless securities by bucket-shop brokerage firms.
Companies that wish to avoid registering with the S.E.C. will be able to do so for longer because the bill raises the threshold for private firms to a maximum of 2,000 shareholders, up from 500. In recent years, several markets for the trading of shares of privately held companies have begun operating, and the bill is expected to help those markets continue to grow.
The element that has most small-business advocates excited is the crowd-funding provision, which institutionalizes a form of financing that is, on a small scale, much like venture capital investing. A company can raise up to $1 million from investors while providing much less disclosure than required by companies seeking to become publicly traded.
Steve Case, the former America Online executive who now heads a private foundation and who campaigned for the crowd-funding measures, said in an interview that while the Internet played a significant role in the lives of most people, ''the ability to use that platform to leverage investment has been limited.''
''This democratizes the access to investments,'' he said, for companies and for investors.
Under the Senate amendments, any company using crowd-funding methods must still file some basic information with the S.E.C., including the names of directors, officers and holders of more than 20 percent of the company's shares, plus a description of the business and its financial condition.
Companies seeking to raise $100,000 or less must also provide tax returns and a financial statement certified by a company principal; those raising up to $500,000 must provide financial statements that are reviewed by an independent public accountant. Companies raising more than that must provide audited financial statements.
The Senate also inserted requirements that intermediaries seeking to help companies raise money through crowd-funding must register with the S.E.C., make sure investors are advised of the risks they are taking, and take measures to prevent fraud.
It is the prospect of fraud that has most critics worried.
The Council of Institutional Investors, a pension fund trade group, said that while it was not clear that the JOBS Act would in fact create jobs, the act would ''create greater risks for investors and ultimately could erode confidence in our capital markets.''
But Representative Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican who worked on the crowd-funding portion of the bill in the House, said that the market would have sufficient incentive to police itself.
''We don't want any fraud in this space because fraud will prevent more people from participating,'' Mr. McHenry said. ''You can have crowd-funding take place with minimal amounts of fraud and illegality.''
Crowd-funding markets, which have to register with the S.E.C., Mr. McHenry said, ''will be incentivized, if they want to stay in existence, to root out fraud.''

HEADLINE: A Major Indicator of Business Sentiment in Europe Declines Unexpectedly

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and BETTINA WASSENER; Bettina Wassener reported from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- A main indicator of business sentiment in Europe unexpectedly fell deeper toward recession territory Thursday, compounding concerns about the global recovery after signs of slowing manufacturing in China.
The gloomy data provided a reminder that, despite the aura of calm in Europe after months of debt-crisis fever, the 17 European Union members that use the euro still have fundamental problems.
Major stock indexes in Europe fell broadly Thursday, and the euro slipped against the dollar, after a survey of purchasing managers suggested that growth in the euro zone declined in the first three months of the year. That would be the region's second consecutive quarter of negative growth, which would meet the broad definition of a recession. Stocks were also down in the United States. Reinforcing the survey results, manufacturing orders in the euro zone fell 2.3 percent in January from December, according to a report Thursday by Eurostat, the European Union's statistics office. That was a slightly bigger drop than expected. 
The figures suggest that the euro zone is still struggling even after a flood of cash from the European Central Bank helped calm fears of a banking crisis and credit crunch.
''The easing of the sovereign debt crisis has apparently failed to bring about a lasting improvement in business sentiment,'' Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank, wrote in a note to clients. Reports next week should offer more clues about the direction of the European economy.
On Monday, the Ifo Institute in Munich will release its monthly survey of business sentiment in Germany, seen as a reliable indicator of growth in the country, the euro zone's largest economy. On Wednesday, the central bank will release its monthly report on the euro zone's money supply, which economists will watch for signs of a recovery in bank lending.
A report by the European Systemic Risk Board, which monitors Europe's financial system, warned that banks remained under pressure as they tried to reduce risky assets and find new sources of capital.
''The main issue is how to ensure the provision of credit to the economy in the current environment,'' the board said. It includes representatives of the central bank, the European Commission and financial industry regulators.
In China, weak external and domestic demand continued to weigh on the manufacturing sector in March, a survey released Thursday showed, raising expectations that the Chinese authorities would step up measures to revive economic momentum.
The survey of purchasing managers in the Chinese factory sector, released by HSBC, showed that activity declined in March for the fifth consecutive month, as the Chinese economy felt the pain of feeble global economic activity.
China has become a major market for European products as varied as heavy machinery and luxury goods, so a slowdown there worsens problems in Europe.
The preliminary reading in the China survey for March dropped to 48.1 from 49.6 in February. Readings below 50 signal contraction, and even though the reading provides only an early insight into this sector of the Chinese economy, the decline was disappointing.
The Australian dollar, which is acutely affected by signs of weakness in China, dropped against the United States dollar after the economic figures were released. Oil and gold prices also declined.
In Europe, the purchasing managers' survey, compiled by Markit Economics, slipped to a three-month low of 48.7 in March from 49.3 in February. In that survey, too, a reading below 50 indicates a contraction in economic activity.
The Markit survey also pointed to a decline in German manufacturing. That is particularly worrisome, because German exports have helped to compensate for sluggishness in Southern Europe as countries like Italy and Spain cut government spending to reduce debt.
''Any hope that the manufacturing cycle is turning rapidly in the euro area is dashed by today's numbers,'' Stella Wang, an analyst in London for Nomura, wrote in a note. But she said the figures were unlikely to prompt the European Central Bank to cut its benchmark interest rate from 1 percent, because inflation remained above the official target of about 2 percent.
The Chinese and euro zone economies are closely linked because many German exports, including cars and heavy machinery, are sold there. China has become the largest market for Volkswagen and other German companies.
''With new export orders sluggish and domestic demand still softening, China's slowdown has yet to finish,'' Xiaoping Ma and Qu Hongbin, economists who follow China for HSBC, wrote in a research note.
Dariusz Kowalczyk, a strategist in Hong Kong for Credit Agricole, wrote in a research note about the purchasing managers' index, that ''the drop is quite large, especially given that March tends to bring an improvement.''
Although the reading is likely to reinforce fears of a hard landing for the Chinese economy, Mr. Kowalczyk emphasized that the slowdown in manufacturing activity was expected to be temporary and that he continued to believe China would have a soft landing, with overall growth this year of 8 percent.
The upside is that Beijing has a fair amount of firepower it can deploy to stimulate growth. May analysts say they expect the authorities to employ a range of these tools as the year progresses.

HEADLINE: Obama Seizes Chance to Score As an Everyman

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama loves basketball, as everyone is reminded in March -- especially in an election year in which he has been jumping through you-know-whats to assert as much.
In addition to doing his annual N.C.A.A. bracket thing on ESPN last week (picking the swing-statey University of North Carolina to win it all), Mr. Obama boasted in a podcast that he knew about the Knicks sensation Jeremy Lin before everyone else did, referred colloquially to the point guard's ''P.T.'' (playing time) and chomped on a widely photographed hot dog at the Western Kentucky-Mississippi Valley State game in Dayton, Ohio. All the while, he looked like any other everyfan in section 101, albeit one with a large security detail and the prime minister of Britain at his side.
It is the latest iteration of the Obama-Just-Folks offensive, and one that coincides -- not by accident -- with some particularly clumsy efforts by the Republican front-runner, Mitt Romney, to shed the stereotypical airs of a super-rich guy. 
Mr. Obama's image makers see sports as an opportunity to exploit what they regard as the president's advantage over the former Massachusetts governor in the quadrennial battle over which candidate can seem more ''ordinary'' than the other (rich) guy running. Sports also provide a ready-made connection to the male voters among whom Republican nominees typically win majorities.
For his part, Mr. Romney also professes to love sports (or ''sport'' as he put it), mentioning that he has friends who own Nascar and N.F.L. teams and demurring (''I'm not plugged in well enough'') when asked for his own N.C.A.A. picks. ''They asked Mitt if he was filling out his brackets,'' David Axelrod, one of Mr. Obama's top advisers, said on Twitter, ''and he said, 'No I have my accountants to do that.' ''
Mr. Romney's supporters have in turn mocked Mr. Obama as professorial and elitist, pointing out the president's own ham-handed attempts to fashion himself an average slob (see ''summit, beer'') and someone who should be doing more important things than watching so much basketball. And they have generally noted the president's regular-dude routine with a group eye-roll.
''Yeah, it's all so natural and organic,'' said the Republican media adviser Mike Murphy. ''The president is making a big move, switching from Evian water to Dasani.''
While office seekers always strain to be the proverbial ''candidate you'd rather have a beer with'' -- and such contests will never favor a teetotaling Mormon -- the president has been laying it on as thick as the Guinness he sipped at a Washington bar on St. Patrick's Day.
In recent weeks, he has indulged in public basketball-watching, barbecue-eating and blues-singing (with Buddy Guy and B. B. King at the White House) that comports with a re-election message geared to working-class voters.
For good measure, Regular Joe Biden, the muscle-car-loving vice president, has been sent to working-class locations in the Rust Belt while the first lady, Michelle Obama, went on ''Late Show with David Letterman'' on Monday and reminded everyone she went shopping at Target last year (Mr. Letterman helpfully flashed a photo of the outing.)
It goes without saying that Target is not the kind of store one might envision, say, Ann Romney pulling up to in one of the Cadillacs that her husband says she drives. Or that the Obamas have been playing up their folksiness at a time when Mr. Romney has proven rather butterfingered with his common touch. And no, this is not a coincidence, Mr. Obama's aides said, although they are reluctant to say so publicly for fear of suggesting that the first couple's penchant for basketball or Target is somehow less than authentic.
''I don't think anyone will be elected president by filling out an N.C.A.A. bracket,'' Mr. Axelrod said in an interview. ''But I do think that that accessibility to a person is important. People want to support people they can relate to and are comfortable with.''
Mr. Romney's advisers say that Mr. Obama is trying to demonstratehis barstool bona fides to obscure his weaknesses in handling the economy, and that the Republican candidate's misfires won't amount to a hill of cheesy grits in the greater scheme of things.
Mr. Romney ''is not running to be buddy in chief,'' said Kevin Madden, a longtime media adviser to Mr. Romney. ''He is focused on big things. All of these episodes are small things.''
Even so, Mr. Obama's team has proven effective in exploiting each gaffe -- and herein, the boilerplate reminder about how it's much easier to do this in the age of YouTube, Facebook, etc. Mr. Axelrod's Twitter account has been a preferred weapon. He is fond of playing on Mr. Romney's curious statement that ''the trees are the right height'' in Michigan (''So Mitt wins Guam, where the Sea Hibiscus are just the right height!'' Mr. Axelrod wrote.)
Mr. Axelrod also sent out a photo of Mr. Obama and his dog, Bo, in the back of a limousine with the caption, ''How loving owners transport their dogs,'' an obvious reference to how Mr. Romney long ago transported his Irish setter, Seamus, in a cage on the roof of the family car during a long trip. This Axelrod Twitter post came a few days after the president's re-election campaign created a ''Pet Lovers for Obama'' group on Facebook.
Mr. Romney's loyalists give Mr. Obama's campaign grudging credit for seizing on Mr. Romney's vulnerabilities and mishaps. ''But how hard is it to cash a lottery ticket?'' said Mr. Murphy, a former adviser to Mr. Romney who is not involved in this campaign. He added that Mr. Obama had benefited from a complicit news media that loves to point out Mr. Romney's perceived screw-ups. This in turn makes the Romney campaign -- and candidate -- overly self-conscious, prompting more gaffes.
''I think Governor Romney knows that he's now trying to feed a dog that's trained to bite him,'' Mr. Murphy said.
The Romney campaign, though, appears determined to bite back. The former governor mocked ''Professor Obama'' during his victory speech Tuesday after winning the Illinois primary. He has also charged that the president's views were nurtured in ''the Harvard faculty lounge'' although Mr. Romney has two degrees from Harvard to Mr. Obama's one.
For what it's worth, the Crimson lost to Vanderbilt in the first round of the N.C.A.A. tournament last week. Mr. Obama picked Vanderbilt to win but said he was rooting for Harvard. And he says the other guy has no convictions.

HEADLINE: Paranoia Strikes Deeper

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Stop, hey, what's that sound? Actually, it's the noise a great political party makes when it loses what's left of its mind. And it happened -- where else? -- on Fox News on Sunday, when Mitt Romney bought fully into the claim that gas prices are high thanks to an Obama administration plot.
This claim isn't just nuts; it's a sort of craziness triple play -- a lie wrapped in an absurdity swaddled in paranoia. It's the sort of thing you used to hear only from people who also believed that fluoridated water was a Communist plot. But now the gas-price conspiracy theory has been formally endorsed by the likely Republican presidential nominee. 
Before we get to the larger implications of this endorsement, let's get the facts on gas prices straight.
First, the lie: No, President Obama did not say, as many Republicans now claim, that he wanted higher gasoline prices. He did once say that a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions would cause electricity prices to ''skyrocket'' -- an unfortunate word choice. But saying that such a system would raise energy prices was just a factual statement, not a declaration of intent to punish American consumers. The claim that Mr. Obama wanted higher prices is a lie, pure and simple.
And it's a lie wrapped in an absurdity, because the president of the United States doesn't control gasoline prices, or even have much influence over those prices. Oil prices are set in a world market, and America, which accounts for only about a tenth of world production, can't move those prices much. Indeed, the recent rise in gas prices has taken place despite rising U.S. oil production and falling imports.
Finally, there's the paranoia, the belief that liberals in general, and Obama administration officials in particular, are trying to make driving unaffordable as part of a nefarious plot against the American way of life. And, no, I'm not exaggerating. This is what you hear even from thoroughly mainstream conservatives.
For example, last year George Will declared that the Obama administration's support for train travel had nothing to do with relieving congestion and reducing environmental impacts. No, he insisted, ''the real reason for progressives' passion for trains is their goal of diminishing Americans' individualism in order to make them more amenable to collectivism.'' Who knew that Dagny Taggart, the railroad executive heroine of ''Atlas Shrugged,'' was a Commie?
O.K., this is all kind of funny. But it's also deeply scary.
As Richard Hofstadter pointed out in his classic 1964 essay ''The Paranoid Style in American Politics,'' crazy conspiracy theories have been an American tradition ever since clergymen began warning that Thomas Jefferson was an agent of the Bavarian Illuminati. But it's one thing to have a paranoid fringe playing a marginal role in a nation's political life; it's something quite different when that fringe takes over a whole party, to the point where candidates must share, or pretend to share, that fringe's paranoia to receive the party's presidential nod.
And it's not just gas prices, of course. In fact, the conspiracy theories are proliferating so fast it's hard to keep up. Thus, large numbers of Republicans -- and we're talking about important political figures, not random supporters -- firmly believe that global warming is a gigantic hoax perpetrated by a global conspiracy involving thousands of scientists, not one of whom has broken the code of omerta. Meanwhile, others are attributing the recent improvement in economic news to a dastardly plot to withhold stimulus funds, releasing them just before the 2012 election. And let's not even get into health reform.
Why is this happening? At least part of the answer must lie in the way right-wing media create an alternate reality. For example, did you hear about how the cost of Obamacare just doubled? It didn't, but millions of Fox-viewers and Rush-listeners believe that it did. Naturally, people who constantly hear about the evil that liberals do are ready and willing to believe that everything bad is the result of a dastardly liberal plot. And these are the people who vote in Republican primaries.
But what about the broader electorate?
If and when he wins the nomination, Mr. Romney will try, as a hapless adviser put it, to shake his Etch A Sketch -- that is, to erase the record of his pandering to the crazy right and convince voters that he's actually a moderate. And maybe he can pull it off.
But let's hope that he can't, because the kind of pandering he has engaged in during his quest for the nomination matters. Whatever Mr. Romney may personally believe, the fact is that by endorsing the right's paranoid fantasies, he is helping to further a dangerous trend in America's political life. And he should be held accountable for his actions.

HEADLINE: The Macro Wars Are Not Over

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: No easy victories, but progress. 

 BODY:
Noah Smith has a post on the current state of the macro controversy that's justifiably getting a lot of attention.By and large I agree with his points: Keynesian revivalists like Brad DeLong and yours truly have not managed to get a dramatic reversal in policy, nor have we persuaded the freshwater side that it's all wrong. But we have managed to change the conversation.
And by the way, I really like the analogy to Louis XIV's wars, which involved many great battles but little change in borders.
That said, I think Noah underestimates how much this continuing argument matters even in the short run.
On the policy side, major new stimulus may not be in the cards -- but there is a real divide in the US between modest stimulus proposals that have some chance of getting implemented and major austerity moves that also have some chance of being implemented. The difference between those two policy variants could be the difference between unemployment below 7 percent two years from now and unemployment back above 9 percent. So this argument has real short-term policy relevance.
And in Europe, the question of whether harsh austerity remains the only tool is very much up in the air. Again, the argument among economists matters.
On the academic side: look, to a first approximation nobody ever admits being wrong about anything. But my sense is that a lot of younger economists are aware, even if they don't dare say so, that freshwater macro has been a great embarrassment these past four years, and that liquidity-trap Keynesianism has done very well. This will affect future research; it will, over time, break the stranglehold of decadent Lucasian doctrine on the journals.
And the giggles and whispers thing -- in which anything resembling non-microfounded Keynesian analysis was the subject of automatic ridicule -- is already, I think, over. Look at Delong/Summers on fiscal policy: the analytical core is, yes, the IS-LM model.
In a better world, Brad and I and our fellow-travelers would have achieved an immediate transformation of both policy and doctrine. We don't live in that world. But I think we are winning the argument, in ways that will make a difference.

HEADLINE: Providers That Make It Easy to Rebalance Your Investment Portfolio

BYLINE: TARA SIEGEL BERNARD


HIGHLIGHT: This week's Your Money column looks at the various providers that make it easy to automatically put your investments back in the proportions you originally set. 

 BODY:
This week's Your Money column examines the best approach to rebalancing your investment portfolio -- in other words, reshuffling your investments back to their original mix to reduce your risks in the market.
While most investors should periodically re-evaluate their portfolios to make sure they don't require any major changes, most of the time all investors need to do is a little maintenance. Perhaps you just need to sell a portion of your stock funds and buy some bonds so that you're not becoming too bloated in any one investment.
Some online brokerage firms and retirement plan providers try to make the task as painless as possible, though we're not quite there yet. Many 401(k) providers, but not all of them, offer workers the ability to automatically rebalance their savings to their original allocation (yet not all employers who have access to the feature elect to turn it on). So if you don't see this in your own plan, this is your cue to speak up and request it. Its use has declined at some 401(k) providers since many newer workers are ushered into target-date funds, which automatically rebalance.
"It's still an attractive option for longer standing or older employees who are still defining their own asset allocation mix," said Dave Tolve, the United States retirement business leader in Mercer's outsourcing business. "Even if it's only 10 percent of people who are using it, that is 10 percent of people who are rebalancing back to a target portfolio, and that is a good thing."
The column outlines a sampling of which providers offer what. But if we have missed any tools or services that help investors automatically (or at least easily) rebalance, please share those in the comment section below.
Does your broker or 401(k) provider offer any rebalancing options? How often do you go through the exercise? What's your strategy?

HIGHLIGHT: Scion announced pricing for its rear-wheel-drive FR-S coupe, which would compete directly with the Hyundai Genesis 2.0T and Ford Mustang. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Scion announced pricing for its FR-S coupe this week. Starting at $24,930 for the 6-speed manual and $26,030 for a car fitted with a 6-speed automatic, paddle shifters and a rev-matching feature, the FR-S is positioned to compete with the Hyundai Genesis 2.0T, at $25,125 to start, and the V-6-powered Ford Mustang, at $22,995. Scion's rear-wheel-drive coupe also received its E.P.A. fuel economy estimates this week. On premium gasoline, the manual car is expected to achieve 22 miles per gallon in city and 30 m.p.g. in highway driving, and the automatic 25 m.p.g. in city and 34 m.p.g. in highway driving. The Subaru BRZ, which was co-developed with the FR-S by Scion's parent, Toyota, received the same estimates, although Subaru has not announced pricing for its coupe. (Scion)
 General Motors said Friday it would replace the standard 120-volt charger cord for the Chevrolet Volt with a superior model for free. The company said the new cord would deliver power more consistently and be more durable than the outgoing model. (The Detroit Free Press)
 Mercedes-Benz released photos of its refreshed GLK compact crossover on Thursday. The 2013 model-year GLK is scheduled to have its formal debut at the New York auto show, where press previews begin April 4. Consistent with the German automaker's design direction, the front fascia and headlamps have been integrated into the body more mindfully, giving the GLK a less upright appearance than the previous model. The standard 3.5-liter V-6 has also received a power boost, from 268 to 302 horsepower. Pricing will be announced closer to its delivery date this summer. (Car and Driver)
 Alan Mann, who oversaw one of the most dominant British Touring Car racing teams of the 1960s, died earlier this month after a long illness at age 75. Alan Mann Racing contracted with Ford and raced Cortina GTs on British and other European circuits, and also was victorious at the 1963 Marlboro 12 Hours in Maryland. Jackie Stewart, Bruce McLaren and Graham Hill were among the drivers who raced for Mann's team during its most successful period. (British Touring Car Championship, via Autosport)
 To meet demand for its Passat midsize sedan, Volkswagen said it would hire 800 additional workers at its recently opened plant in Chattanooga, Tenn. The plant, which was built at a reported cost of $1 billion, was said to have capacity to build 150,000 vehicles a year when it opened, but VW said it could double capacity without constructing new buildings. In January, VW added 200 workers to increase its rate of production from 31 to 35 Passats an hour. (Volkswagen)

HEADLINE: Wedding Bells Still Chime

BYLINE: SABRINA TAVERNISE


HIGHLIGHT: Despite the perception that marriage is in decline, a new report finds that 8 in 10 women still marry by age 40. 

 BODY:
If you believe marriage is in decline, think again. A new government report has found that 8 in 10 women will get married by the time they turn 40, a figure that is virtually unchanged from the 1990s, before the drop in middle-income jobs reduced the supply of marriageable men. 
The report was based on findings from the National Survey of Family Growth, a survey of more than 22,000 men and women conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2006 and 2010. It provides one of the best estimates for marriage and divorce in the United States, and drew considerable attention among researchers and news organizations when it was released publicly on Thursday. 
But while many chose to highlight the most immediate finding, that 4 in 10 women between the ages of 15 and 44 are currently married, demographers who sifted through the numbers said the longer-term trend - that most women eventually still do marry -- was more surprising, as it challenged the now commonly held perception that marriage is disappearing.
"The idea that marriage is on the decline and fading away, that picture is misleading," said Andrew Cherlin, a demographer at Johns Hopkins University.

Lifetime marriage is far lower today than it was during the peak years in the 1950s, when more than nine-tenths of the adult population married at some point in their lives. But the new report suggests that the decline may have stopped in recent decades, Mr. Cherlin said, as lifetime marriage rates have changed little since the 1990s.
The figure of 4 in 10 women currently married may seem stark, demographers say, but it is simply a reflection of the fact that women are marrying later in the age spectrum. (The survey questioned men and women ages 15 to 44.) In 1982, the share of women currently married was 52 percent, and in 1995 it was 49 percent. 
The story, Mr. Cherlin said, is more about postponement than abandonment. Marriage has declined precipitously among young women, both college graduates and women with less education. But most women do eventually marry. According to the report, 82 percent of women who ended their formal education after graduating from high school will marry by the age of 40. Among women with a college degree the figure is 89 percent.
Marriage has remained mostly intact, but childbearing in wedlock has not, a change that has opened a deep class divide. College-educated women tend to wait to marry before having their children. Less educated women do not, a choice that has driven a major change in American family structure. More than half of all births to women under 30 take place outside of marriage, according to Child Trends, a research group in Washington. 
Just 8 percent of births to women over 18 with a college degree happen outside wedlock, compared to 57 percent of births to women with high school diplomas or less, according to Child Trends, which cited 2009 data.

HEADLINE: India's Decrepit, Unsafe Railways

BYLINE: MONISHA RAJESH


HIGHLIGHT: When traveling by rail in India, expect mice, carriages that are falling apart and toilets that empty onto the tracks. 

 BODY:
Dinesh Trivedi: 'If you do not increase the fares, you are going to turn the railway coaches into coffins.'
The recent resignation of railways minister Dinesh Trivedi caused an uproar in India, and raised serious questions about the stability of India's governing United Progressive Alliance. It has also shined a spotlight on the decrepit, outdated and unsafe conditions in some of India's massive, 65,000-kilometer, or 40,000-mile, rail system, which carries seven billion passengers a year.
Mr. Trivedi, who was asked to leave after proposing a raise ranging from 2 paise per kilometer traveled to 30 paise per kilometer, said in an interview Wednesday that he would propose the fare hike again, because conditions are that dire. The railway system, some of which is 150 years old, is courting disaster by not investing money to repair tracks and adding safety features that are standard in other countries.
"If I had to give the budget again, I would give the same budget," he insisted. "The passengers were telling me to increase the fares, the unions were telling me, the general public was telling me, everyone was telling me that if you do not increase the fares, you are going to turn the railway coaches into coffins."
As an experienced rail passenger, I share Mr. Trivedi's concerns. Starting in January of 2010 I spent four months traveling the length and breadth of Indian Railways, riding over 100 trains as research for a book.
Indian Railways is considered the bloodstream that keeps the nation alive, a heavy burden when its passenger services operate at an annual loss of 200 billion rupees, or about $3.9 billion. In addition to an aging system and fiscal problems, there are a number of other problems: traffic between large cities often runs at more than 120 percent of planned capacity, causing trains to travel more slowly and tracks to wear out faster than intended. Lightweight tracks and underpowered locomotives mean that trains can haul no more than 5,000 tons of cargo, compared with 20,000-ton capacities in the United States, China and Russia. And the waste which falls directly from the train toilets is corroding tracks.
Indian trains have an unrivaled charm and even beauty, but the main reason I chose them was that they were incredibly cheap. A 90-day air conditioned car two-tier rail pass cost $540 - including meals. For many people they are the only way to travel long distances - airline tickets are too expensive, and India's roads are too poor. 
As I traveled, a general disregard for safety was a constant. I passed unmanned railway crossings, where cyclists attempted to wheel their bikes across the tracks, even as trains were within view, toddlers lingered a mere meter, or about four feet, from the train thundering past, and vegetable sellers sat at the edges of tracks. Often, I observed this lack of safety from an open doorway of a speeding train. On a journey from Goa to Londa, Karnataka I was eventually asked to move by a guard who explained that a few moments before, someone had fallen out of the door.
Setting anecdotal evidence aside, the facts and figure are indicative of the issues facing the railways. According to a report by the Kakodkar Committee - set up by the government after a derailment last July - India still has 14,869 unmanned level crossings which contribute to an estimated 15,000 deaths every year - an average of 40 deaths every day. "No civilized society can accept such massacre on their railway system," the report said. 
Since Mr Trivedi resigned, two train accidents occurred, one in Hathras in Uttar Pradesh and one on the outskirts of Lucknow, resulting in a total of 16 deaths and 4 critically injured people.
Mr Trivedi said during the interview he had planned to hire 200,000 people to deal with overall safety. "I wanted to eliminate the railway crossings and introduce the overbridge and underbridge," he said. "I had proposed a separate organization only to do this, and now where is this money going to come from?"
It's clear when you are traveling the trains that India's railways need serious spending, not just to improve safety but to keep from falling apart. Many carriages currently in use date from the late 1980s, and parts of them may be older than that. On the Rajdhani Express from Delhi to Chennai I drew the compartment door shut and watched as the bolt and locks fell off. A government official from the Lok Sabha, who happened to be traveling in the compartment with me, eyed the broken door: "Many of these trains are cut-and-paste jobs. The carriage will be a rajdhani and the compartment will be fitted from an old mail train." He shrugged. "Until it falls apart, they will make do." He declined to be quoted.
The current number of trains can no longer cope with the increasing pressure from operating above capacity. Bookings open 90 days in advance and yet overcrowding and double-booking is still a problem.
After being assigned R.A.C., or reserved against cancellation tickets on an overnight train from Pune to Delhi, which mean passengers are guaranteed a seat but not a berth, I watched as fellow passengers coaxed the train ticket examiner into finding available berths, using 500-rupee notes slotted between their fingers. Unwilling to resort to bribery, my traveling companion spent the night sleeping in the laundry cupboard.
Rats and cockroaches are a severe problem, largely due to a lack of garbage cans and adequate cleaners. One a trip from Kottayam to Coimbatore, a friend who was traveling with me glanced down at the floor, wide-eyed, to my empty tea cup. "There's a mouse at your tea bag," he said. I reassured him that this was the norm and it scurried off, only to reappear at dinner to nibble the remains of chapattis under the seat.
Where money has been invested the positive effect is evident. The new fleet of Duronto express trains introduced in September 2009 is faster, offering more comfort and space with the added benefit of being derailment-proof. Executive class in the Chandigarh-Delhi shatabdi, a superfast train that leaves and returns to base in one day, looks no different than the Eurostar.
The second- and third-tier tickets that you need to buy to ride these new trains cost about six times the price of general class tickets, making them available only to the upper classes. Going from Pune to Delhi in a Duronto would cost 1455 rupees, while a general class ticket in the Jhelum Express, which has not been updated, would be 234 rupees. Train travel is still a bargain compared to airline travel, though. The most expensive train ticket between Delhi and Chennai, on the Duronto, is 4125 rupees compared with a flight at 7,375 rupees on SpiceJet.
On an overnight train from Jodhpur to Jaisalmer, traveling in general class, two of the four toilets flooded, forcing 72 people to share two toilets over a period of six hours with no signs of repairs. More worrying, on three separate occasions the emergency windows in general class refused to open.
"There is too much politics in rail, and a trend to discourage any kind of modernization. It is a sad story," Mr Trivedi lamented. "If the railway is not robust, the economy of India will not grow."

HEADLINE: What's 4 + 4 + 4?

HIGHLIGHT: A bill to increase the mandatory schooling age looks sound, but it could send Turkey to the back of the class. 

 BODY:
 ISTANBUL - The answer is 12, the number of years that legislation now steamrolling its way through the Turkish Parliament would require children to spend in school. The law proposes to increase compulsory schooling by four years, up from eight grades.
This may sound like just the thing to help Turkey overcome its education deficit. Forty percent of the country's 15-year olds are unable to reach basic competence in mathematic literacy (pdf). Turkey is ranked 32nd in scientific literacy out of the 34 O.E.C.D. countries in the organization's Program for International Student Assessment.

But the real purpose of the legislation may be less to keep children in school longer than to let them pursue intensive religious education younger. Once again, education reform here is caught in the never-ending tug of war between the old secular establishment and the conservative government of the Justice and Development (AK) Party.
Today's muddle goes back to Turkey's last great educational reform, which was enacted in 1997, just after the military helped push out of power an Islamist-led coalition. Back then, the incoming secularist government decreed that Turkish children would have to spend at least eight years in school, instead of the previous five.
This reform, along with a campaign to cut truancy and encourage girls to enroll in primary school, would turn out to be the key to getting young Turkish people better jobs. It was a poverty-reduction measure on an epic scale.
But these measures were also politically motivated. By requiring that all eight compulsory years of schooling be spent under the same primary-school roof, they abolished middle schools. This meant that children could not enter vocational schools until the ninth grade (rather than the sixth, as before).
The generals had their sight on delaying admission to one type of vocational school in particular: ,which were used to train the Islamic clergy. Never mind that were less like madrassas than parochial schools in the United States. By the mid-1990s, they were attracting some 11 percent of children in the relevant age group and developing into a parallel system of education. For the staunch secularists in power that was too much.
By the time the AK Party took over from the generals, a decade ago, only about 2 percent of eligible children attended clerical schools. Since then, the AK Party has been determined to undo the effects of the 1997 reform. That's why the current reform proposes to both extend mandatory schooling to 12 years and divide that time into four years of primary school, four years of middle school and four years of high school (hence the "4 + 4 + 4" slogan). The idea is to revitalize middle schools and allow children to take a large number of elective options: in some cases, plumbing; in others, religious studies.
The bill is causing an uproar. It was written without public debate - or even discussion in the education ministry's own consultative body, the National Education Council - and it did not figure in the government's 2011 election manifesto. Fierce objections to it, mainly from the opposition Republican People's Party, led to fist fights and chairs being thrown in Parliament earlier this month.
The critics' concerns are real. According to education specialists, the new measures would undermine educational standards and deepen social inequalities. The fifth grade, they argue, is just too early for children to be steered away from a basic curriculum and be asked to make vocational choices about how to spend the rest of their life.
Experts also say that the new system would hurt the less privileged. To get into the best schools in Turkey, children often have to take competitive examinations. Under the new law, children from deprived homes or who only know Kurdish when they enter the first grade will be hurt when they compete for middle school: they are unlikely to have overcome their handicap by the end of fourth grade in a system where Turkish is the language of instruction.
Another fear is that some parents will pull their daughters out of formal schooling after primary school to take advantage of options currently being considered that would allow for home schooling as early as the fifth grade.
The education faculties of most of Turkey's leading universities - including Sabanci University, Bosphorus University, Middle East Technical University and Koc University - have all issued press statements recently describing the reforms as hastily conceived, retrograde and out of step with current thinking.
They, at least, have realized that the government is playing politics with pedagogy.

HEADLINE: 'If I Had a Son, He'd Look Like Trayvon,' Obama Says

BYLINE: ROBERT MACKEY


HIGHLIGHT: Speaking at the White House on Friday morning, President Obama briefly addressed the national uproar over the killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American high school student. 

 BODY:
As my colleague Michael Shear reports, at the White House on Friday morning, President Obama briefly addressed the national uproar over the killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American high school student who was shot by a neighborhood watch captain in Florida last month. 
Video of Mr. Obama's remarks, made in response to a reporter's question after he announced Jim Yong Kim, the president of Dartmouth College and a global health expert, as his pick to lead the World Bank, was posted on the White House YouTube channel.
Asked by a reporter to comment on the case in Florida, which has raised "allegations of lingering racism within our society," Mr. Obama said:
I'm the head of the executive branch and the attorney general reports to me, so I've got to be careful about my statement to make sure that we're not impairing any investigation that's taking place right now, but obviously, this is a tragedy. I can only imagine what these parents are going through, and when I think about this boy, I think about my own kids. And I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this, and that everybody pulls together, federal, state and local, to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened. 
So I'm glad that not only is the Justice Department looking into it, I understand now that the gov of the state of Florida has formed a task force to investigate what's taking place. I think all of us have to do some soul-searching to figure out, how does something like this happen. And that means that we examine the laws, and the context for what happened, as well as the specifics of the incident. But my main message is to the parents of Trayvon Martin. You know, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon. And I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves, and we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.

HEADLINE: VIPshop of China Tumbles in American Debut

BYLINE: NEIL GOUGH and EVELYN M. RUSLI


HIGHLIGHT: Shares of VIPshop, the first Chinese company to list in the U.S. since August, opened at $6 per share, 7.7 percent below its offering price of $6.50 per share. 

 BODY:
10:13 a.m. | Updated 
HONG KONG - VIPshop, an online retailer from China, tumbled in its American debut on Friday, as investors remain skeptical of Chinese-based companies.
VIPshop, whose shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange, is the first Chinese company to list in the United States since August. But investors didn't bite. The stock, which went public at $6.50, dropped 15 percent, to close Friday at $5.50.
Chinese companies have been effectively shut out of the North American markets for the last six months, after accounting scandals and fraud cases involving China-based firms erased billions of dollars in market value from the portfolios of investors. Paulson & Company, the hedge fund run by the billionaire John Paulson, lost about $500 million last year on its investment in the Sino-Forest Corporation.
Such controversies have weighed on other stocks. Of the dozen Chinese firms that went public on American exchanges last year, 10 are still trading below their offering prices, according to data from Renaissance Capital, an I.P.O. research and advisory firm.
"Investors are unsure how to act," said Stephanie Chang, a Renaissance Capital analyst. "Part of the problem is company-specific, but there is also concern that China's economic growth is slowing down."
VIPshop, based in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, bills itself as China's leading online discount retailer. The company offers name brand fashion goods via online "flash sales," or deeply discounted offers valid for a limited time. VIPshop says it has worked with more than 1,900 brands, including Adidas, Esprit, Nine West, Geox and Triumph.
As with many start-ups, VIPshop - in which venture capital firms DCM and Sequoia Capital each have a 19 percent stake - is strong on growth and weak on profits. Revenue surged sevenfold last year to $227.1 million, from $32.6 million in 2010. But net losses widened to $107.3 million last year from $8.4 million in 2010.
It is also making less off each shopper. The site's average transaction value, determined based on its regulatory filings by dividing reported revenue by number of transactions, was about $40 in 2009. That fell to $35 per transaction in 2010 and $31 last year.
Hurst Lin, a general partner DCM general partner, said he was not worried by the market's reaction on Friday to VIPshop. He said the lack of interest in Chinese investments provided more opportunities for firms like DCM, which are plowing more capital into the region.
"Because many investors are focused on the developed markets, now is a good time to invest," Mr. Lin said. "If I want to look for growth, there's no better place than China."
Like some Chinese companies listing on overseas markets, VIPshop doesn't actually own its underlying operating business. Foreign companies and investors are still barred from controlling companies across a range of sectors in China, including the booming Internet and media industries.
"I didn't think this deal was ever going to go through because there are too many layers of risk involved," said Fredrik qvist, a Beijing-based independent financial analyst who writes a blogon the such legal issues in China.
To get around this, companies often rely on "variable-interest entities" or V.I.E. Basically, this involves registering a wholly foreign-owned company in mainland China, which signs exclusive revenue or profit-sharing contracts with the Chinese-owned, licensed operating business. The foreign-owned company has effective control, but doesn't have equity ownership of the Chinese business.
Several Chinese companies seeking overseas I.P.O.'s have employed this structure, including Sina, Baidu.com, Sohu.com and Tudou. But the inherent risks were highlighted last year when Jack Ma, the founder of the Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba, surprised investors like Yahoo by announcing he had transferred ownership of the group's lucrative online payment business, Alipay, to a private Chinese firm that he controlled.
That caught the attention of Beijing's economic policy makers, and in the months since then a wave of reports have suggested that official action to vet or reform variable-interest entities could be imminent. VIPshop lists such risks in its regulatory filings.
"All the new China I.P.O.'s are going to look like this, with long disclosures on the risks regarding the V.I.E. structure," Mr. qvist said.

Bank of America Tests Rental Program as Alternative to Foreclosure | Bank of America said Thursday that it would offer a small number of customers facing foreclosure the option to remain in their homes and rent the property instead. The program highlights how investors are increasingly interested in becoming landlords on troubled properties.
Under the terms of the pilot program, which will be offered initially to about 1,000 consumers only in New York, Nevada and Arizona, homeowners will give up the title to their property in exchange for bank forgiveness of their mortgage debt. They would then be able to rent the property for up to three years.
The rent payments would be less than the monthly mortgage payment and be set at or below market rates, according to bank officials. At first, Bank of America would retain ownership of the properties before selling them to outside investors. If the pilot program, known as Mortgage to Lease, is successful, the bank could expand it.

9 Graduates Lose Case Against New York Law School | Amid a challenging time in the legal industry, a growing chorus of law-school graduates are bemoaning the lack of job opportunities. One judge does not want them complaining in his courtroom.
Melvin L. Schweitzer, a New York Supreme Court judge, dismissed a lawsuit brought by nine graduates of New York Law School who accused their alma mater of misleading them about their postgraduate employment prospects.
While expressing some sympathy for the students' plight, Justice Schweitzer said the action had no merit and was essentially a case of caveat emptor - let the buyer of a legal education beware.

HEADLINE: Will Geithner or Paulson Occupy Dartmouth?

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Now that there may be an opening for the presidency of Dartmouth, two of its most famous alumni who often appear in the news could make interesting candidates for the post -- Timothy F. Geithner and Henry M. Paulson Jr. 

 BODY:
The news that Jim Yong Kim, the president of Dartmouth College, is the front-runner to run the World Bank raises a question: if Mr. Kim leaves Dartmouth, who will replace him?
DealBook would not normally have jurisdiction over such a question, but it seems to us that potential candidates to lead Dartmouth are two of its most famous alumni who appear on our site from time to time -- Timothy F. Geithner and Henry M. Paulson Jr.
Mr. Geithner, class of '83, is perhaps the more compelling possibility. After more than three grueling years as Treasury secretary -- and five years before that as head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York -- Mr. Geithner has made it clear that he will leave the administration after President Obama's first term. So where might he go next?
As he stood by Mr. Kim's side in the Rose Garden nomination ceremony on Friday morning, we suspect that the potential opening at Dartmouth might have crossed his mind.
He could, of course, take a job at a Wall Street firm, but after helping steer the economy through the global financial crisis, he might want a change of pace. Plus, he has never worked at a commercial bank. He is a career civil servant with something of an academic bearing. In addition to his Dartmouth undergraduate degree in government and Asian studies, he holds a master's degree in international economics from Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.
Mr. Geithner is also a Dartmouth legacy, having followed in the footsteps of both his father, Peter Geithner, '54, and his paternal grandfather, Paul Geithner. His wife, Carole Sonnenfeld Geithner, is also an alumna.
Another factor that could make the Dartmouth job work for Mr. Geithner is his family situation. He has a daughter at Stanford and a son who is a high school senior. Last spring, Mr. Geithnernearly left his Treasury post to move back to New York because his son wanted to finish his last year of high school there. Instead, at the president's request, he stayed in Washington. Next year, Mr. Geithner will have an empty nest, making the move to Hanover, N.H., less complicated.
A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment.
Then there's Mr. Paulson, '68, who is a former football star at Dartmouth and who remains connected to the school. Mr. Paulson, Mr. Geithner's predecessor as Treasury secretary, now lives in Chicago. There, he runs the Paulson Institute, which focuses on United States-China relations. He is also a major supporter of environmental causes and a passionate bird watcher. Dartmouth's picturesque New England setting would seem well suited for Mr. Paulson at this stage of his career, though a demanding, full-time job might not be. 
American statesmen with Dartmouth degrees have a history of devotion to their alma mater. In 1819, the constitutional scholar Daniel Webster, class of 1801, defended his college in the Supreme Court case Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward. In defeating an attempt by the New Hampshire governor to take control of the Dartmouth board, Mr. Webster delivered a line that is often repeated on the Hanover campus: "It is, sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it."

HEADLINE: More Partners Leave Dewey & LeBoeuf

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Six partners at Dewey &#038; LeBoeuf resigned on Friday, the latest is a series of defections at the embattled New York law firm. With the latest departures, Dewey has lost 37 of its 300 partners since January. 

 BODY:
Six partners at Dewey & LeBoeuf resigned on Friday, the latest in a series of defections at the embattled New York law firm.
The lawyers, who are leaving to join Sutherland Asbill & Brennan, focus on insurance regulation and advise on corporate transactions involving insurance companies.
With the latest departures, Dewey has lost 37 of its 300 partners since January. Its respected insurance practice has been decimated, as 12 other partners in the group left the firm last week.
Dewey has run into problems after extending multiyear, multimillion-dollar guarantees to many of its top producers. After missing its financial targets last year, the firm has had to defer or, in some cases, slash compensation. As a result, many partners have been leaving.
Large law firms face an uncertain environment amid sluggish overall performance since the financial crisis and mounting pressure on profitability. Corporate clients, which themselves have struggled through the difficult economic climate, have demanded discounts from their firms.
Angelo Kakolyris, a Dewey spokesman, played down the impact of the recent departures. He said that the firm had expected additional resignations and that they would not have a material impact on the firm's finances.
"These additional departures, while regrettable, we do not believe will change the conclusion that the firm is poised to have a very good economic year," Mr. Kakolyris said. "We have a strong and deep bench as is evidenced by the results our professionals are producing for our clients and the firm."
The recent defections come during a week when Dewey's leadership held a partners' meeting, where they emphasized the firm's strong financial position and encouraged the firm's approximately 270 remaining partners to stay.
"We are producing the best work in the history of the firm and producing some of its strongest ever results," Steven H. Davis, the firm's chairman, said in a statement. "The overwhelming majority of our partners are excited about our future."
Despite its woes, the 1,100-lawyer firm continues to win business. Springleaf Financial Services, a unit of the Fortress Investment Group, hired Dewey this week to help revamp its business. The firm also represented the computer company Dell in its acquisition of SonicWall earlier this month.
The six lawyers leaving for Sutherland are James R. Dwyer, the managing partner of Dewey's Chicago office; John S. Pruitt and Cynthia R. Shoss, co-chairs of the insurance regulatory department; P. Bruce Wright and Linda A. Sciutow, two tax partners; and Jeffrey H. Mace, an insurance partner.
For Sutherland, based in Atlanta, the additions expand its presence in New York.
"Our clients will immediately benefit from this added depth and breadth," Mark D. Wasserman, Sutherland's managing partner, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Dartmouth College President Is Nominated to Lead World Bank

BYLINE: TANYA CALDWELL


HIGHLIGHT: Jim Yong Kim, the president of Dartmouth College, has been nominated by the Obama administration to lead the World Bank. 

 BODY:
Jim Yong Kim, the president of Dartmouth College, has been nominated by the Obama administration to lead the World Bank, Annie Lowrey reports.
"The leader of the World Bank should have a deep understanding of both the role that development plays in the world and the importance of creating conditions where assistance is no longer needed," President Obama said Friday. "It's time for a development professional to lead the world's largest development agency."
He became the first Asian-American to head an Ivy League institution when he took the Dartmouth post in 2009. 
While working with Partners in Health in Lima, Peru, in the mid-1990s, Dr. Kim helped to develop a treatment program for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, the first large-scale treatment of that disease in a poor country. Treatment programs for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis are now in place in more than 40 nations, according to Dr. Kim's biography on Dartmouth's Web site. Dr. Kim also spearheaded the successful effort to reduce the price of the drugs used to treat this form of tuberculosis.
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Nigerian finance minister and former World Bank official, is also a nominee for the World Bank job.
Dartmouth officials released a statement that supported Dr. Kim's nomination:
We are honored that Dartmouth President Jim Yong Kim has been nominated by the president of the United States for such an important position. The World Bank is one of the most critical institutions fighting poverty and providing assistance to developing countries in the world today. Advancing a mission of such global importance at the request of our nation's president reflects the qualities of service and engagement with the world that have long distinguished Dartmouth.
If the World Bank approves the nomination of President Kim, then Dartmouth's board of trustees will take appropriate steps to ensure continuity of leadership and determine the timing of a search.

HEADLINE: Who Shouldn't Go to College?

BYLINE: JUDITH SCOTT-CLAYTON


HIGHLIGHT: Those dismissive of college don't recognize how much higher education has changed and how much vocational training is now offered on college campuses, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Rick Santorum's recent diatribe against higher education, in which he called President Obama a "snob" for wanting "everybody in America to go to college," has reinvigorated the seemingly endless debate over whether college is worthwhile.
Economic evidence consistently and compellingly documents the value of postsecondary education in general (as Economix contributors have written about more than once). But high average returns do not necessarily imply that everyone should invest in college. So is there anyone who should not go to college - and if so, who?
The answer is clearly yes: some folks do have good reasons to skip (or at least delay) college. But the good reasons are more limited than the ones Mr. Santorum and other college skeptics typically cite.

First, Mr. Santorum and others often suggest that those who "want to work out there making things" don't need to go to college - instead they should pursue vocational or on-the-job training. But most vocational training, and even some highly specific job training, now occurs on community and technical college campuses. 
Mr. Santorum's perception that "college" refers primarily to baccalaureate education is several decades out of date, as the chart below shows. In fact, only about half of the credentials awarded by undergraduate institutions are traditional bachelor's degrees. The rest are either associate's degrees or certificates, the vast majority of which are in applied fields. 
The Applied Technology Department at Macomb Community College in Michigan, for example, offers programs and courses "for apprentices, craftsmen, technicians and others" in building construction, manufacturing, maintenance and repair, among other fields.
Second, those who advocate against college often cite extremely unrepresentative individuals - like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, who both dropped out of Harvard - as evidence that one can skip college and earn billions of dollars anyway. 
The only broad lesson to be drawn from these unusual cases is that prospects outside of college do matter: if you have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity - say you are one of the lucky teenagers selected by the entrepreneur Peter Thiel to receive $100,000 in exchange for skipping college and pursuing your dreams - then by all means go for it. College will still be an option down the line.
But it makes little economic sense to forgo college in order to be unemployed or working part-time at a minimum wage job, which are the more likely scenarios for a young high school graduate with no further education. Fewer than half of young high school graduates who don't pursue postsecondary education are employed full-time, as this table shows: 
So who shouldn't go to college, despite the breadth of available postsecondary options and the bleak labor-market outlook for high school graduates? The simplest answer is: those who don't want to go.
While college may be a great investment, it's not like investing in the stock market: a prospective student can't just fork over some money and let someone else worry about how to make it grow. For college to have any payoff, students must participate in the process by going to class and engaging with course materials, peers and instructors. 
The cost of college includes not just monetary costs but psychological costs, which are highest for those who either strongly dislike classroom instruction or have to work particularly hard to get anything out of it. Individuals with high psychological costs who enroll anyway because that is what they believe they "should" do may end up with the worst of both worlds: forgoing income (and possibly accumulating debt) without accumulating skills. 
Survey data from the federal Department of Education suggest that 95 percent of high school seniors do in fact plan to go to college, but some of these students may aspire to college in the same way that many of us aspire to exercise: it is something they would like to have done but not something they would like to do. 
In this metaphor, investing in education by enrolling in college is like investing in health by joining a gym: an excellent idea, but only for those who will actually go and break a sweat. 
Acknowledging the importance of personal commitment does not, however, let society off the hook for persistent inequalities in educational attainment by race and growing gaps by income. Students' educational preferences may be based on incomplete or incorrect information about what types of programs are available and how much they will cost. 
Moreover, the psychological costs of college are a function not just of individual preferences but of previous preparation and college quality. 
College may not be for everyone. But we ought to at least aspire to a world in which the decision to opt out is well informed, unrelated to family background and not the result of unequal access to good institutions at either the pre-college or college level.

HEADLINE: Recession's Lasting Effects

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: A paper by Lawrence Summers and J. Bradford DeLong finds evidence that the recession eroded the capacity of workers and of equipment with effects that persist. 

 BODY:
More grim ruminations on our economic prospects: What if recessions do permanent damage, diminishing a nation's productive capacity?
As I wrote on Thursday, recessions are commonly understood as disruptive rather than destructive to the economy as a whole. But a paper presented Friday at the Brookings Institution warns that recessions may do lasting harm, like an untended house that not only needs a good dusting, but has also started to rot.
The term for this possibility sounds perfectly harsh: hysteresis. (The definition is more benign; it simply means that the past affects the present.)
The authors, Lawrence H. Summers, a former adviser to President Obama, and J. Bradford DeLong, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, see evidence that the recession is eroding the capacity of workers and of equipment:
Reduced capital investment, reduced investment in research and development, reduced labor force attachment on the part of the long-term unemployed, scarring effects on young workers who have trouble beginning their careers, changes in managerial attitudes, and reductions in government physical and human capital investments as social-insurance expenditures make prior claims on limited state and local financial resources.

The fact of reduced investment is clear, as shown in the graph below. The question is whether a rebound in investment eventually will fill the gap, as happened in the United States after the Great Depression, or whether losses will be permanent, as happened in Europe in the 1980s and Japan in the 1990s.
Much of this reduction in is in the housing sector, where it is quite possible less investment is a good thing. Other types of disinvestment are more damaging. The National Science Foundation reported recently that spending on research and development suffered "a rare decline" in 2009. Restrictions on the military budget have raised concerns about the Pentagon's commitment to research spending, an issue that I wrote about earlier this year.
There also may be an effect on employment: Workers may become less employable the longer they remain outside the work force, creating a long-term reduction in the supply of available labor. Mr. Summers was the co-author of a famous paper in the 1980s arguing that just such an effect was dragging on Europe, but the mechanism he proposed - that unions lost interest in their former workers - does not apply in the United States, where unions play a smaller role. Still, Mr. Summers and Mr. DeLong argue in their current paper that other causes may be producing the same effect, perhaps because skills atrophy, or because workers become comfortably dependent on government.
This is not a far-fetched possibility. It has been raised by many economists, including the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.
But as the authors note, "The historical macroeconomic evidence on the existence and size of hysteresis effects is distressingly thin."
The United States rebounded completely from the Great Depression. Europe and Japan have not rebounded from their more recent traumas. And we are now living through what may be just the fourth comparable experience.
The proper antidote to hysteresis, the authors write, is an increase in government spending.They write that under current conditions there is a good chance such spending would be self-financing, as tax revenues from resulting economic activity would outweigh the cost. But there is little prospect that Congressional Republicans will revisit their opposition to stimulus this year. Which means that our current experiment will run to completion: If hysteresis is real, we will know it by its consequences.

HEADLINE: From Engineering Marvels, a Turnaround in U.S. Oil Output

BYLINE: CLIFFORD KRAUSS


HIGHLIGHT: Advances in seismic analysis, fiber optics, alloys and adhesives have accelerated oil and gas drilling in the last five years. 

 BODY:
As Eric Lipton and I write in The Times, oil production is increasing rapidly in the United States even as gasoline consumption is falling. 
The revolution in production in Texas and across the country is partly tied to the rising price of oil over much of the last decade, which propelled aggressive technological experimentation and development. (Government encouragement over the last several administrations helped as well.)
Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have been around for years, but over the last five years, engineers have fine-tuned these and other techniques, even as many environmentalists worry about their impact on water and air.
Computer programs have been developed to simulate wells before they are even drilled. Advanced fiber optics permit senior engineers at company headquarters to keep track of drillers on the well pad, telling them when necessary where to direct the drill bit and what pressure to use in injecting fracking fluids. Seismic work has become far more sophisticated, with drillers dropping microphones down adjacent wells to measure seismic events resulting from a fracking job so they can more accurately determine the porosity and permeability of rocks when they drill nearby in the future.
Just a decade ago, complete wells were fracked at the same time with millions of gallons of water, sand and chemical gels. Now the wells are fracked in stages, with various kinds of plugs and balls used to isolate the bursting of rock one section at a time, allowing for longer-reaching, more productive horizontal wells. A well that once took two days to drill can now be drilled in seven hours.
For instance, when the Apache Corporation began drilling in the 100,000-acre Deadwood field in the West Texas Permian basin in 2010, there had only been a trickle of production there. The deep shale, limestone and other hard rocks had potential, but for years they had not been considered economically viable. The rocks were so hard, they would have likely sheared off the usual diamond cutters on the blade of any drill bit attempting to cut through.
But new adhesives and harder alloys have made diamond cutters and drill bits tougher in recent years. Meanwhile, Apache experimented with powerful underground motors to rotate drilling bits at a faster rate. Now, a well that might have taken 30 days to drill can be drilled in just 10, for a savings of $500,000 a well.
"By saving that money, you can spend more on fracking, which translates into more sand and more stages and better productivity," said John J. Christmann, the Apache vice president in charge of Permian basin operations.
Apache has already drilled 213 wells in the field, producing 9,000 barrels a day. With 13 rigs running, it hopes to eventually drill more than 1,000 wells, and produce 20,000 barrels a day there.
"We're having a revolution," said Steve Farris, Apache's chief executive. "And we're just scratching the surface." 
The company is already producing so much oil, and associated natural gas and gas liquids like butane and ethane, that it has teamed with Crosstex Energy to build an $85 million natural gas processing plant to avoid flaring wasted gas. Crosstex in turn has bought and upgraded a nearby railroad terminal to transport the gas liquids to Louisiana for petrochemical refining. Similar developments are unfolding across North Dakota, Wyoming, Ohio, Colorado and even Kansas. 
Environmentalists are critical because burning more fossil fuels contributes to climate change.
 "Life needs to be protected and global warming is the most profound threat to life on earth." said Jay Lininger, an ecologist at the Center for Biological Diversity, which is pushing the federal government to protect wildlife from the effects of drilling in the Permian Basin, the Gulf of Mexico and the Alaskan Arctic.

HIGHLIGHT: The Obama administration eases restrictions on data collected by intelligence officials, and the United States finds itself on the path toward energy independence. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:

        
The Obama administration moved Thursday to ease restrictions on what counterterror analysts can do with information the government gathers about Americans who are not suspected of having connections to terrorism. Under the new guidelines, the National Counterterrorism Center can hold onto that private data for five years, up from the previous limit of 180 days, Charlie Savage reports.

        
Higher gas prices and the recession have been driving consumption down. Rising oil prices and new technology have been driving production up. Together, decreased consumption and increased production have unexpectedly pushed the United States toward independence from foreign energy sources, Clifford Krauss and Eric Lipton report.

        
It's March and an election year, and President Obama's interest in basketball offers an opportunity for his campaign to make him seem ordinary to voters, an advantage he holds over Mitt Romney in particular, Mark Leibovich writes.

        
The meticulous crafting of political advertising involves polling, demographic research and focus groups. But sometimes those ads still end up on the cutting room floor, like the ad Ben Stein filmed for George W. Bush, reprising his role from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," Jeremy W. Peters reports.

        
Signaling lawmakers' desperation to turn around their low approval ratings in an election year, the Senate overwhelming passed an ethics bill banning insider trading by members of Congress on Thursday, Robert Pear reports.

        
The Senate approved a bill Thursday that aims to help start-ups raise money and create jobs, but some are skeptical about its effect of rolling back regulations on corporate financial disclosure, Edward Wyatt reports.

HEADLINE: Obama Speaks Out on Trayvon Martin Killing

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama spoke in highly personal terms about the impact of the shooting in Florida of a 17-year-old black youth named Trayvon Martin, saying that "if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon." 

 BODY:
1:20 p.m. | Updated President Obama spoke in highly personal terms on Friday about how the shooting in Florida of a 17-year-old black youth named Trayvon Martin had affected him, saying that "if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon."
The comments by Mr. Obama were his first on the explosive case in which a neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, has claimed self-defense after shooting Mr. Martin several weeks ago. The case has generated outrage about the state's so-called Stand Your Ground law.
Mr. Obama was asked about his feelings regarding the case during the announcement of his nominee for president of the World Bank in the Rose Garden on Friday morning. 
The president often appears perturbed when he is asked off-topic questions at ceremonial events, but on Friday, he seemed eager to address the case, which has quickly developed into a cause clbre around the country. He cautioned that his comments would be limited because the Justice Department was investigating. But he talked at length about his personal feelings about the case.
"I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this," Mr. Obama said. "All of us have to do some soul searching to figure out how does something like this happen."
The brief remarks were nonetheless a rare example of Mr. Obama speaking to the nation as an African-American parent and the father of two children. 
"Obviously, this is a tragedy. I can only imagine what these parents are going through," Mr. Obama said, his face grim. "When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids."
The most powerful line came at the end of his brief remarks, as he said that his "main message" was directed at the parents of Mr. Martin, who have expressed their deep grief during interviews on television over the last several days.
"You know, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon," Mr. Obama said, pausing for a moment. "I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves, and we are going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened."
Mr. Obama sidestepped some of the most sensitive and politically charged specifics about the case -- whether Mr. Zimmerman should be arrested; whether the Stand Your Ground law goes too far in protecting people who shoot others; whether the police chief in Sanford, where the shooting took place, should be fired. (The chief, Bill Lee, stepped down temporarily on Thursday, saying he had become a distraction to the investigation.)
"I'm the head of the executive branch, and the attorney general reports to me," Mr. Obama said. "So I've got to be careful about my statements to make sure that we're not impairing any investigation that's taking place right now."
Thousands of supporters of Mr. Martin's parents expressed their outrage about the killing at a rally in Florida on Thursday night, adding to the growing political dimensions of the case.
The shooting took place Feb. 26, when Mr. Zimmerman, 28, pursued, confronted and fatally shot Mr. Martin, an unarmed high school student carrying only an iced tea and a bag of Skittles.
In a statement on Friday, Mitt Romney, the presumed front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, said: "What happened to Trayvon Martin is a tragedy. There needs to be a thorough investigation that reassures the public that justice is carried out with impartiality and integrity."
Rick Santorum made some pointed comments about the killing while campaigning at a shooting range in West Monroe, La., before the Louisiana primary on Saturday.
"Well, stand your ground is not doing what this man did," he said. "There's a difference between stand your ground and doing what he did. It's a horrible case. I mean it's chilling to hear what happened, and of course the fact that law enforcement didn't immediately go after and prosecute this case is another chilling example of horrible decisions made by people in this process."
Newt Gingrich, campaigning Friday in Port Fourchon, La., said the district attorney had done "the right thing" in empaneling a grand jury. But, speaking of Mr. Zimmerman, he said it was "pretty clear that this is a guy who found a hobby that's very dangerous."
"Having some kind of neighborhood watch is reasonable, but you had somebody who was clearly overreaching," Mr. Gingrich said. "As I understand Florida law, what he was doing had nothing to do with the law that people are talking about."
A History of Caution on Race
The last time the president waded into a racially charged incident, it became a political problem for him.
Asked at a news conference about the arrest of a black Harvard professor in the summer of 2009, Mr. Obama offered his opinion, saying that the white officer from Cambridge, Mass., had acted "stupidly" and starting a weeklong controversy about what he said.
"I think it's fair to say, No. 1, any of us would be pretty angry; No. 2, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home; and, No. 3 , what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there's a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately,'' Mr. Obama said at the time. "That's just a fact.''
Mr. Obama eventually invited the professor, Henry Louis Gates Jr., and the police officer, James Crowley, to the White House to discuss the situation over some beers.
But despite that incident, the president has been careful not to wade into racial politics. As the nation's first African-American president, he is sometimes criticized by black leaders who say he is not doing enough to deal with problems in that community.
Asked about the issue in a news conference in his first few months in office, Mr. Obama defended his approach as one that "will lift all boats" by working to "level the playing field and ensure bottom-up economic growth."
"I'm confident that that will help the African-American community live out the American dream at the same time that it's helping communities all across the country," Mr. Obama said in April of 2009.

HEADLINE: Republicans Cry Foul on Obama Catchprase

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama's use of a phrase to describe his energy policy is driving some Republicans nuts, because the phrase has been a product of their party's energy platform for years. 

 BODY:
As taglines go, "All of the above" is not exactly phenomenal, lacking the sex appeal of its energy-policy sister, "Drill, baby, drill," and the historic resonance of, say, "Where's the beef?" It conjures a standardized test more than economic stimulus. 
 But President Obama's use of the phrase to describe his current energy policy leanings - signaling yes to a combination of domestic drilling, alternative energy and conservation -- is driving Republicans nuts, because the phrase has been a product of their party's energy platform for years. 
They find it especially galling since Mr. Obama made moves to block, for now, part of the expansion of the Keystone XL pipeline. 
Mr. Obama has used the phrase while visiting oil-rich areas of the country, and his administration is promoting it every chance it gets. 
It is hard to know precisely how "all of the above" came to pertain to energy, although Senator John McCain and his running mate in 2008, former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, made good use of it in their presidential campaign, along with "drill, baby, drill" and that underdog maxim, "mine, baby, mine." 
But it may well have been conceived in 2000 on the floor of the House, when Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of New York, gave a lengthy speech on energy, saying: "We need to be exploring alternative energy sources, the use of coal, the use of hydroelectric power, of biomass, geothermal, photovoltaic, solar thermal and wind, utilizing ethanol, creating a system of electric reliability, increasing the exploration and supply of natural gas, and retrofitting or building cost-efficient oil refineries. In addition, we need to utilize government land for responsible oil and natural gas exploration."
Mr. Gilman also said that the American Petroleum Institute at the time advocated "that an effective national energy policy must, at a minimum, allow for all of the above."
In 2007, other Republican members picked up the phrase, including Representative Zach Wamp of Tennessee, who called himself "an all-of-the-above energy guy," to The Chattanooga Times Free-Press.
The phrase has been popularized by Republicans throughout the last decade but came into its own during the 2008 campaign, beginning on the Hill. "There's no question that if we're ever going to begin to seriously move toward energy independence," said John A. Boehner, then the minority leader and now the speaker, "which is good for our national security and, frankly, very good for our economy -- that we have to do all of the above."
Clark Stevens, a White House spokesman, dismissed the issue of catchphrase appropriation, saying that Mr. Obama embodies the notion that Republicans popularized. 
"By pursuing an energy agenda that is expanding domestic oil and gas production, with oil production at an eight-year high," he said, "effectively doubling renewable energy from sources like wind and solar in his first term, providing funding for the first new nuclear power plant in 30 years, and investing in advanced technologies and R&D that will help America be a leader in the 21st-century energy economy, it's clear that from the beginning the president, unlike many who have used the phrase in the past, has actually embraced a true all-of-the-above approach."
Domestic oil production has increased during the Obama administration, largely through the continuation of policies put in place by President George W. Bush. 
But in the face of rising gas prices and increased criticism from Republicans, Mr. Obama, who has previously tried to keep his environmentalist base voters at bay on this issue, has begun to push his "all of the above" notions aggressively; this week, the White House announced in Oklahoma that it would expedite the southern half of the Keystone XL pipeline. 
 "We're pleased the president is now supporting Republicans' 'all-of-the-above' energy strategy with his words," said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, "but his actions tell a different story. Blocking more American energy production on federal lands and offshore and personally lobbying against Keystone is the opposite of 'all of the above,' and the American people understand that."

HEADLINE: Etch A Sketch Highlights Missed Opportunities for Romney's Rivals

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's policy shifts have given his Republican rivals a lot of ammunition, and yet, they have rarely been able to do much with it. 

 BODY:
I'm sympathetic to the notion that the news media's coverage of the Etch A Sketch comments made by one of Mr. Romney's top aides has been excessive. At the same time, the comments made by the adviser, Eric Fehrnstrom, will serve to remind voters of a major issue in the campaign: that Mr. Romney has substantially altered his positions on a wide range of issues since he ran for governor in Massachusetts in 2002.
Almost all presidential candidates shift their positions on some issues -- toward the party base in the primaries, and then toward the center of the electorate if they receive the nomination. But there is not a lot of precedent for a presidential candidate whose shifts were so recent and broad-based.
In 2002, as well as during his Senate campaign in 1994, Mr. Romney very explicitly ran as a moderate, especially on social issues. His campaign's Web site in 2002 told voters that he would support "the strict enforcement of gun laws" and recognition of domestic partnership for same-sex couples, that he would "protect the current pro-choice status quo in Massachusetts," and that he endorsed an increase in the minimum wage. 
Mr. Romney's campaign was also much different in tone. At times, it previewed the "post-partisan" theme of Barack Obama's speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.
"Our opponents are tired. Their record is weak. They will retreat to the politics of fear. We will embrace the politics of hope," Mr. Romney, said upon accepting the endorsement of delegates at the Republican state convention. "My political philosophy is not drawn with narrow partisan lines," he said during the same speech.
Although Mr. Romney has long been consistent in his advocacy of lower taxes, there were also hints of populism in his message from time to time. 
"This is not about how can we can help businesses be more successful or how we can get the tax rate down for the wealthiest 1 percent," he told The Boston Herald in a 2002 interview. "That is not what motivates me in this race. It's how can we get the Massachusetts families to be part of the American dream, those that have been left behind."
"Romney's message seems more tailored to a Democrat like former President Clinton," The Herald concluded.
Mr. Romney began to shift some of his positions late in his gubernatorial tenure and then declined to run for a second term. As late as 2005, however, the nonpartisan Web site OnTheIssues.org rated Mr. Romney as being exactly in the middle of the electorate on both social and economic issues based on the public statements he had made. Using the same methodology, that Web site now classifies Mr. Romney as being quite conservative based on his more recent statements.
And those 2005 ratings were before the passage of Mr. Romney's health care law for Massachusetts in 2006, which contained an individual mandate and other substantial commonalities to the one that Mr. Obama and Democrats passed in 2010 and which Mr. Romney has now pledged to repeal.
This is not an exhaustive list of Mr. Romney's policy shifts; the point is simply that his rival campaigns have a lot of ammunition to work with. And yet, they have rarely been able to make much of it.
Tim Pawlenty famously flubbed a line about Mr. Romney's health care bill during an early debate. Newt Gingrich and his "super PAC" attacked Mr. Romney on his tenure at Bain Capital, but was much more reluctant to go after Mr. Romney's inconsistencies -- possibly because Mr. Gingrich has some apostasies of his own. 
Ron Paul, who has perhaps the most consistent voting record of any presidential candidate in memory, has rarely gone after Mr. Romney directly. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. was more willing to, but he was a minor player during most of the campaign, and he lacked the budget to give the slick commercials he had produced on Mr. Romney's shifts a wide airing on television.
Two rivals, Rick Santorum and Rick Perry, were potentially in a stronger position to attack Mr. Romney on these grounds. But Mr. Romney's campaign successfully executed the same bold strategy against them, shifting the conversation to highlight their own departures from conservatism. The sequence during the Feb. 22 debate in Arizona, in which Mr. Santorum was initially making an effective attack against Mr. Romney's health care bill but Mr. Romney turned the conversation around to Mr. Santorum's endorsement of Arlen Specter, was the clinching moment for that strategy and may have helped Mr. Romney to win Michigan when it voted a week later.
Indeed, Mr. Romney's issue shifts have become less and less at the top of voters' minds over the course of the campaign; Google searches on the term "Romney flip flop" have been in steady decline since January.
One common conceit is to portray Mr. Romney as having been the beneficiary of good luck in skirting these attacks. However, I think there is something more to consider.
Voters are not as well-informed about these issues as people inside the Beltway. That does not necessarily imply that they make poor decisions, but the campaigns and the news media can overestimate how much they know.
A recent Pew poll, for instance, found that only about 30 percent of Republicans (and an even smaller fraction of Democrats) knew that Mr. Santorum is Catholic. A larger fraction, two-thirds, knew that Mr. Romney was Mormon -- but that still left a third of Republicans who were unsure of Mr. Romney's religion despite widespread discussion about it.
Since turnout in primaries and caucuses is relatively low, the voters there may be relatively more informed. Still, they are unlikely to know every detail of a candidate's record.
An early December poll of likely voters in the Iowa Republican caucus, for instance, found that 74 percent of voters said it would raise concerns if a candidate had supported an individual mandate for health care, as Mr. Romney did. But 14 percent of those concerned voters nevertheless planned to vote for Mr. Romney, not much worse than the 16 percent he polled over all in the survey. Some of those voters may have weighed their concern about the individual mandate against other issues and chosen to support Mr. Romney despite it, but others might not have known much about it -- and could have voted differently if they had.
This gives an edge to campaigns that are skilled at driving their own message rather than relying on the news media to do it, since the news media's fascination with different elements of the campaign inevitably waxes and wanes and may not penetrate that far with ordinary voters.
And Mr. Romney's campaign has some advantages in this department. First, Mr. Romney has run for president before, something no other candidate but Mr. Paul had done. Although Mr. Romney's opponents have more ammunition against him this year than they did in 2008 because of the increased salience of his health care bill, his experience has allowed him to become more effective at deflecting these attacks.
Second, Mr. Romney's campaign has a skilled and professional communications team, Mr. Fehrnstrom's recent remarks notwithstanding, while the other campaigns have often relied on lone advisers with limited experience.
Third, Mr. Romney (and his super PAC) have raised the money to run attacks against their opponents on the television airwaves. Mr. Romney's opponents often have not, and when they have, they have tended to attack Mr. Romney on issues other than his flip-flops.
Fourth, Mr. Romney has the support of the large plurality of influential Republicans, meaning that he has plenty of formal and informal surrogates willing to vouch for him and echo his attacks while downplaying the ones made by his rivals.
None of this has much to do with luck; these are tangible and important advantages that Mr. Romney's operation has had throughout the nomination campaign.
Whether the Etch A Sketch comments will have much effect in the remainder of the primary season will depend on whether Mr. Romney's opponents are more effective at driving a message than they have been in the past.
The gaffe is also well-timed for Mr. Romney, because it comes during a relatively slow part of the nomination calendar and the effects of such incidents often fade quickly. Louisiana votes on Saturday but there are only 20 delegates at stake in the primary there. There will not be another primary until April 3, when Wisconsin, Maryland and the District of Columbia vote.
That is not to predict that the Etch A Sketch comments will have no lasting effect at all. But the only campaign that might have the skills and resources necessarily to fully exploit them is Barack Obama's, which Mr. Romney will probably be facing in November.

HEADLINE: Leaders of Mali's Military Coup Seem to Have Uncertain Grasp on Power

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER; Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
DAKAR, Senegal -- Mali's military coup leaders struggled on three fronts Friday, as international condemnation mounted, an insurrection by nomadic tribesmen in the north gained ground and the junta was forced to condemn looting by its own troops in the capital, Bamako.
A day after overthrowing the country's elected president and arresting his ministers, the military men who have seized power -- led by Capt. Amadou Haya Sanogo, who received extensive training in the United States between 2004 and 2010 -- appeared to have an uncertain grasp on power in what had hitherto been one of Africa's most stable democracies. 
International dismay over Thursday's coup seemed all the stronger because of the country's widely acknowledged democratic record. The new government's isolation grew, potentially perilous for an impoverished, aid-dependent country.
On Friday, the African Union temporarily suspended Mali, the European Union cut off some aid and regional leaders said they would hold an emergency session early next week in Ivory Coast to discuss the crisis. The World Bank suspended funds, and the United States has threatened a cutoff. Even China, normally reluctant to weigh in on African upheavals, condemned the coup.
The country's democratic bona fides had appeared set for more confirmation next month, as President Amadou Toumani Toure was giving up power voluntarily -- a rarity in the region -- in a scheduled election.
But on Wednesday night the soldiers chased Mr. Toure from the presidential palace and took over the state broadcaster. Their leaders cited dissatisfaction with the way Mr. Toure's government was handling a rebellion by nomadic Tuareg tribesmen in the country's north.
In the coup's wake, state television has periodically broadcast declarations from coup leaders condemning looting. There is an acute gas shortage in Bamako, as stations shut to forestall gasoline theft by marauding soldiers. On Friday night, the broadcaster, a key strategic asset, flashed an on-screen message imploring the population ''not to give in to panic'' and insisting the station was under the control of the military junta.
The whereabouts of Mr. Toure -- a former general who seized power himself in the last coup, in 1991, before returning the nation to civilian rule and winning elections in 2002 and 2007 -- remained a mystery. Captain Sanogo suggested to reporters, indirectly, that he was in the custody of the mutineers, though some diplomats in the capital were skeptical. The African Union chief, Jean Ping, said Mr. Toure was being protected by troops loyal to the president.
In the country's vast desert north, where Tuareg tribesmen have been battling Mali's army with surprising success for three months, the insurgents late Thursday claimed the capture of another town. The announcement cast doubt on the coup leaders' stated reason for overthrowing the government of Mr. Toure: that he was incompetent in managing the northern crisis.
''We're not here to confiscate power,'' Captain Sanogo told Africable television, promising to ''give up power as soon as possible.'' He did not specify a timetable, however. He justified the arrest of a number of Mr. Toure's top ministers, saying: ''It wasn't working. They failed in their duties.'' The junta has suggested the ministers could face criminal prosecution.
Mali and the United States have had close military ties in recent years as part of American counterterrorism programs. According to the State Department, Captain Sanogo attended an English-language instructor course at the Defense Language Institute, a special school for international military students at Lackland Air Force Base, Tex., from August 2004 to February 2005.
Nearly three years later, in December 2007, Captain Sanogo returned to the United States, this time for more English language classes at Lackland before attending the Army's entry-level course for intelligence officers at Fort Huachuca, Ariz., instruction that he completed in July 2008.
Finally, Captain Sanogo attended the Army's prestigious infantry officer basic training course at Fort Benning, Ga., from August 2010 to December 2010.
But the United States has roundly condemned the seizure of power, and on Friday the coup leaders continued to exhibit what appeared to be only a tentative grasp on their objectives.
''I'm asking myself some questions,'' said Pierre Boilley, a Mali expert at the Sorbonne. ''Is this really an organized coup d'etat, since it started as a mutiny? Will it succeed? Because it is not finished. It's possible the state will regain the upper hand.''
The country's political class has been slow to react to the coup, stunned by its unexpectedness. But on Friday afternoon, the first signs of open opposition appeared, with several leading political parties issuing strong condemnations.
''This coup d'etat cannot be justified, all the more so in that it has come about on the eve of an election that would have permitted the election of a new president,'' said the Party for National Renaissance, in a statement from its president, Tiebile Drame, a former foreign minister. ''It has set us back decades.''
Bamako was calmer than on previous days. The gunfire had died down, and some stores were open, though residents reported much less traffic than normal.
''The situation is calmer today, but people are still uneasy,'' said Moctar Mariko, president of the Malian Human Rights Association. ''There is a gasoline crisis. Men in uniform were helping themselves freely, and not paying.''
Like others, he condemned the coup, but also Mr. Toure's government for mishandling the rebel invasion in the north. There is wide agreement among politicians, analysts and civil-society activists that Mr. Toure had left his relatively small army unprepared and underequipped to deal with a rebel force that had armed itself heavily with weapons from the armories of the fallen Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
''The government had not sufficiently prepared the army to confront the rebellion,'' Mr. Drame said in an interview. ''Most of the defeats in the desert were because the troops had no motivation to fight. The Malian army was humiliated.''
But Mr. Drame, himself a candidate, added, ''In a place where there is an election in a month, it is difficult to understand why troops would take over from the government.''

HEADLINE: Split Outlook On Economy

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
Despite recent improvements in the economy, Americans are divided about whether the upswing will continue for the rest of this year, In fact, Americans are split about evenly, a new survey shows. 
About half of those surveyed are confident that the recovery will last through 2012, and half are not, according to Bankrate's Financial Security Index survey for March.
The telephone survey of 1,006 adults, conducted in March by Princeton Survey Research Associates International, has a margin of sampling error of four percentage points.
Differences in outlook depended on age and income. Consumers who are more comfortable with their level of savings and debt now, compared with a year ago, tend to be under age 50, have a college education and annual household income of $75,000 of above.
Those who are less comfortable about their savings and debt, however, tend to be 50 and older, have no more than a high school education and household income of less than $30,000.
And among retirees, those saying their financial situation is worse now than a year ago outnumber those saying it is better by about three to one.
Even though unemployment has declined to 8.3 percent, job security still weighs on the outlook of many Americans. The survey found that 21 percent feel more secure about their jobs than a year ago -- an improvement over a low of 13 percent reported in November. Yet, about the same proportion -- 20 percent -- say they feel less secure about their jobs. (The majority of consumers said they felt about the same.)
Do you feel you are better off financially than you were a year ago? Are you optimistic that the economic recovery will continue?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: On the Right, Santorum Has Women's Vote

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
MANDEVILLE, La. -- Rick Santorum was running late, and about 250 people were growing restless at a rally sponsored by the Tea Party. So the Harris sisters, a country singing duo, took the stage.
They harmonized on ''Game On,'' a sprightly campaign anthem that concluded, ''Yes, I believe/Rick Santorum is our man.''
What happened next was more like a revival meeting than a political event.
The performers asked each other and the crowd what they liked best about the presidential candidate. Camille Harris, 20, exclaimed into the microphone, ''Seven kids! Seven kids!'' Turning her attention to Mr. Santorum's youngest, Isabella, born with a genetic disorder, the singer added, ''Didn't abort the last one, which is amazing.'' 
Then several women in the crowd called out that Mr. Santorum was a Christian and a ''man of faith,'' and that he was ''honest and honorable.'' Bursting with enthusiasm, one woman said, ''He's for life!''
There is no mistaking the bond that Mr. Santorum has with conservative women -- particularly married women -- a group that has formed a core of his support since the primaries began in January. He has handily carried the votes of women in primaries that he has won, including those in Mississippi and Alabama. And where he has lost, in Arizona, South Carolina and Illinois, he has enjoyed a higher level of support among women than men.
Even as it becomes increasingly clear that Mr. Santorum, who is lagging behind Mitt Romney in both the delegate and money race, will probably remain the runner-up and not the nominee, women who support him say they still will have sent a message about values, and console themselves with the fact that the candidate, who is 53, is young enough to run in 2016.
''He doesn't give up, so I'm not giving up,'' said Kay Verdi, 75, a mother of six from Belle Chasse, La., who spends much her time trying to persuade others to vote for Mr. Santorum. ''I've never felt as strong about a candidate as I do for Santorum. I've usually had to pick the lesser of two evils when I vote. Not this time.''
How did Ms. Verdi explain the attraction?
''I like that he's been married only once, and that he has character and faith; that's what touches me,'' she said.
The Web site ricksantorum.com attracts more women than men, 60 percent of its visitors, a larger share than for the Web sites of other candidates, according to Nielsen ratings that were released last week. Among other things, there may be an empathy factor at work: A New York Times/CBS News poll taken this month found that 73 percent of Republican female voters said Mr. Santorum understood the needs and problems of people like them, compared with 52 percent who said the same about Mr. Romney.
''If it's not his turn this time, it may be next time,'' said Linda Terrebonne, 60, a retired court clerk who cheered for Mr. Santorum at a small rally last week in Harvey, La. ''If he doesn't win, I'll go with the new guy, although I wouldn't be really pleased about it.''
When Mr. Santorum took the stage in Mandeville on Wednesday, where his supporters had arrived rain-drenched, braving flash floods and a tornado watch, he did not sound as if he would be conceding the nomination any time soon. ''I want to remind you what your duty is,'' he told the crowd. ''Reset this race.''
Louisiana may have a chance to help do that. Mr. Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, is expected to do well in the primary on Saturday. Louisiana's demographics and conservative political culture align with those of Southern states where he has prevailed. But beyond places like Mandeville, a Republican enclave north of New Orleans, Mr. Santorum will face a steep uphill climb toward the nominating convention in August.
But after Mr. Santorum's speech, Lindsey Kersker, 45, a homemaker who lives in Mandeville, signed a check for $50.
''I can tell you why he does well with me, because he's strong on family values and he's very religious,'' Ms. Kersker said. ''I think that this country needs to have a renewal of its moral compass, and this is the man to do it.''
When the Harris sisters' song, ''Game On,'' got wide attention on the Internet this month, it made them minor celebrities in conservative circles. People sing along to the words, ''We've finally got a man who will stand for what is right.''
''If he can run his household, he can run the country. Amen!'' Haley Harris, 18, told the Mandeville crowd.
The battles over access to contraception and other women's health issues that have sprung to life on the Republican campaign trail in recent weeks have had the effect of disenchanting some moderate Republican women. But for conservative women, the opposite may be true.
''His ideas don't infringe upon my rights at all,'' said Lauren Deppe, 21, a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. ''As far as birth control, my mom and I say you've got birth control right with you. It's called abstinence.''
In fact, Mr. Santorum's campaign theme of late, ''Freedom,'' resonates among conservative women who believe that less regulation would benefit the economy, a main concern, and keep the government from having a heavy hand in health care decision-making.
Ms. Deppe also said that she believed that Mr. Santorum ''would be good for the economy.''
But more than his energy proposals, or his stance on immigration or foreign policy, it is Mr. Santorum's personal biography that women say moves them the most. And he has not been shy about sharing the facts of his life, and most poignantly, the story of his youngest child, known as Bella, who was born with trisomy 18, a fatal disorder.
Bella has emerged as the emotional centerpiece of Mr. Santorum's campaign. His references to her are easily the most riveting moments of his speeches, usually leaving audiences silent and weepy. He has even built entire speeches around Bella's story, telling certain audiences, especially those in churches, every painful detail of her birth and how the family has embraced her as a blessing.
''I feel as though I know Bella,'' Ms. Terrebonne said. ''I can relate.''
Bella, and Mr. Santorum's staunch anti-abortion stance, are among the reasons Carol Klotz, a retired antiques dealer in Metairie, La., prays for him every morning at Catholic Mass. She also started a rosary group that prays for the country and Mr. Santorum.
''The main issue for me is that he's strong and pro-life,'' Ms. Klotz said. On the issue of abortion, she said, ''We're getting on God's last nerve, hello! We can't keep killing people in this country and getting away with this. God will have the last say.''
Ms. Klotz said she had shown some interest in Newt Gingrich, but decided against him months ago. ''I started thinking about it, and the youth of this country need a young person to rally behind,'' she said.
''I will certainly be voting for Rick Santorum as long as I can,'' Ms. Klotz continued, ''because he is a wonderful family man, and we're very excited for him.''

HEADLINE: Chinese Firm's U.S. Debut Suggests Investor Caution After Earlier Scandals

BYLINE: By NEIL GOUGH and EVELYN M. RUSLI

 BODY:
10:13 a.m. Updated
HONG KONG - VIPshop, an online retailer from China, tumbled in its American debut on Friday, as investors remain skeptical of Chinese-based companies.
VIPshop, whose shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange, is the first Chinese company to list in the United States since August. But investors didn't bite. The stock, which went public at $6.50, dropped 15 percent, to close Friday at $5.50.
Chinese companies have been effectively shut out of the North American markets for the last six months, after accounting scandals and fraud cases involving China-based firms erased billions of dollars in market value from the portfolios of investors. Paulson & Company, the hedge fund run by the billionaire John Paulson, lost about $500 million last year on its investment in the Sino-Forest Corporation. 
Such controversies have weighed on other stocks. Of the dozen Chinese firms that went public on American exchanges last year, 10 are still trading below their offering prices, according to data from Renaissance Capital, an I.P.O. research and advisory firm.
''Investors are unsure how to act,'' said Stephanie Chang, a Renaissance Capital analyst. ''Part of the problem is company-specific, but there is also concern that China's economic growth is slowing down.''
VIPshop, based in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, bills itself as China's leading online discount retailer. The company offers name brand fashion goods via online ''flash sales,'' or deeply discounted offers valid for a limited time. VIPshop says it has worked with more than 1,900 brands, including Adidas, Esprit, Nine West, Geox and Triumph.
As with many start-ups, VIPshop - in which venture capital firms DCM and Sequoia Capital each have a 19 percent stake - is strong on growth and weak on profits. Revenue surged sevenfold last year to $227.1 million, from $32.6 million in 2010. But net losses widened to $107.3 million last year from $8.4 million in 2010.
It is also making less off each shopper. The site's average transaction value, determined based on its regulatory filings by dividing reported revenue by number of transactions, was about $40 in 2009. That fell to $35 per transaction in 2010 and $31 last year.
Hurst Lin, a general partner DCM general partner, said he was not worried by the market's reaction on Friday to VIPshop. He said the lack of interest in Chinese investments provided more opportunities for firms like DCM, which are plowing more capital into the region.
''Because many investors are focused on the developed markets, now is a good time to invest,'' Mr. Lin said. ''If I want to look for growth, there's no better place than China.''
Like some Chinese companies listing on overseas markets, VIPshop doesn't actually own its underlying operating business. Foreign companies and investors are still barred from controlling companies across a range of sectors in China, including the booming Internet and media industries.
''I didn't think this deal was ever going to go through because there are too many layers of risk involved,'' said Fredrik Oqvist, a Beijing-based independent financial analyst who writes a blog on the such legal issues in China.
To get around this, companies often rely on ''variable-interest entities'' or V.I.E. Basically, this involves registering a wholly foreign-owned company in mainland China, which signs exclusive revenue or profit-sharing contracts with the Chinese-owned, licensed operating business. The foreign-owned company has effective control, but doesn't have equity ownership of the Chinese business.
Several Chinese companies seeking overseas I.P.O.'s have employed this structure, including Sina, Baidu.com, Sohu.com and Tudou. But the inherent risks were highlighted last year when Jack Ma, the founder of the Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba, surprised investors like Yahoo by announcing he had transferred ownership of the group's lucrative online payment business, Alipay, to a private Chinese firm that he controlled.
That caught the attention of Beijing's economic policy makers, and in the months since then a wave of reports have suggested that official action to vet or reform variable-interest entities could be imminent. VIPshop lists such risks in its regulatory filings.
''All the new China I.P.O.'s are going to look like this, with long disclosures on the risks regarding the V.I.E. structure,'' Mr. Oqvist said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Six More Partners Leave Dewey & LeBoeuf Firm

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Six partners at Dewey & LeBoeuf resigned on Friday, the latest in a series of defections at the embattled New York law firm.
The lawyers, who are leaving to join Sutherland Asbill & Brennan, focus on insurance regulation and advise on corporate transactions involving insurance companies. 
With the latest departures, Dewey has lost 37 of its 300 partners since January. Its respected insurance practice has been decimated, as 12 other partners in the group left the firm last week.
Dewey has run into problems after extending multiyear, multimillion-dollar guarantees to many of its top producers. After missing its financial targets last year, the firm has had to defer or, in some cases, slash compensation. As a result, many partners have been leaving.
Large law firms face an uncertain environment amid sluggish overall performance since the financial crisis and mounting pressure on profitability. Corporate clients, which themselves have struggled through the difficult economic climate, have demanded discounts from their firms.
Angelo Kakolyris, a Dewey spokesman, played down the impact of the recent departures. He said that the firm had expected additional resignations and that they would not have a material impact on the firm's finances.
''These additional departures, while regrettable, we do not believe will change the conclusion that the firm is poised to have a very good economic year,'' Mr. Kakolyris said. ''We have a strong and deep bench as is evidenced by the results our professionals are producing for our clients and the firm.''
The recent defections come during a week when Dewey's leadership held a partners' meeting, where they emphasized the firm's strong financial position and encouraged the firm's approximately 270 remaining partners to stay.
''We are producing the best work in the history of the firm and producing some of its strongest ever results,'' Steven H. Davis, the firm's chairman, said in a statement. ''The overwhelming majority of our partners are excited about our future.''
Despite its woes, the 1,100-lawyer firm continues to win business. Springleaf Financial Services, a unit of the Fortress Investment Group, hired Dewey this week to help revamp its business. The firm also represented the computer company Dell in its acquisition of SonicWall earlier this month.
The six lawyers leaving for Sutherland are James R. Dwyer, the managing partner of Dewey's Chicago office; John S. Pruitt and Cynthia R. Shoss, co-chairs of the insurance regulatory department; P. Bruce Wright and Linda A. Sciutow, two tax partners; and Jeffrey H. Mace, an insurance partner.
For Sutherland, based in Atlanta, the additions expand its presence in New York.
''Our clients will immediately benefit from this added depth and breadth,'' Mark D. Wasserman, Sutherland's managing partner, said in a statement.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Weak Sales In Housing; Prices Rise

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of new homes fell in February for the second consecutive month.
The Commerce Department said Friday that new-home sales dropped 1.6 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 313,000 homes. Sales have fallen nearly 7 percent since December. 
While a mild winter and three months of strong job growth have lifted resales, those conditions have not helped the new-home market. The current pace is less than half the 700,000 that economists consider to be healthy.
Economists cautioned that the housing market was a long way from fully recovering.
''Despite renewed hopes over the turn of the year for an imminent turn in housing, it appears that it is too early for such optimism to translate into a rapid pickup in real activity,'' said Yelena Shulyatyeva, an analyst at BNP Paribas.
There were some positive signs in the report. The government revised December's sales figures up to show an annual rate of 336,000, the best sales pace in a year.
And the median sales price for new homes surged in February more than 8 percent, to $233,700. That is the highest median price since June.
Just 150,000 new homes were for sale in the United States in January and February -- the lowest number in records that date back to 1963. The supply of new homes on the market has consistently fallen over the last two years, which could help stabilize prices.
Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the price increase may have been ''an indication of home builders' growing confidence in their sector.''
Builders are growing more confident after seeing an increasing number of people express interest in buying this year. They have responded by requesting the most permits to build single-family homes and apartments since October 2008.
Sales of previously occupied homes have risen more than 13 percent since July. And January and February made up the best winter for resales in five years, when the housing crisis began.
A crucial reason for the dismal sales in the new-home market is that builders must compete with foreclosures and short sales -- when lenders accept less for a house than what is owed on the mortgage.
Sales were mixed across the country. They fell 2.4 percent in the Midwest and 7.2 percent in the South. They rose 8 percent in the West and 14.3 percent in the Northeast.

HEADLINE: Helping Small-Business Owners Find the Perfect Mentor

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
VICE ADM. EDWARD M. STRAW was a bit skeptical when he was asked to donate his time and expertise to a program that helps small-business owners. He had mentored students hoping to get into his alma mater, the Naval Academy, and service members on their way out of the military.
This was different, though. Sure the program carried the imprimatur of the Clinton Foundation and his financial adviser at UBS was asking him to participate. But Admiral Straw said he questioned whether his background -- he had commanded the Defense Logistics Agency before a successful second career in the private sector -- would be useful to a small business.
''I said, 'I'll only do this if my skills would help the company,' '' said Admiral Straw, who was president of global operations at Estee Lauder and now serves on six boards. ''I wanted a company that made something.'' 
I met Admiral Straw last month at a dinner in New York for the 10 teams that had been part of the Small Business Advisory Program, a joint venture of the Clinton Foundation's Economic Opportunity Initiative and UBS Wealth Management. My initial interest was in how UBS had coaxed the mentors, all busy business people, into giving their time and sharing their expertise with people they did not know. But I became equally intrigued with the entrepreneurs, who all had hit inflection points in their businesses after years of growth.
The Clinton Foundation program is one of dozens of programs -- some more successful than others -- that pair entrepreneurs with mentors, from those overseen by the Small Business Administration to more specialized ones like the Venture Mentoring Service run by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And with Congress and the presidential candidates talking about ways to help small-business owners who have fallen on hard times, I thought it useful to look closely at a program whose success did not depend on money but time.
PROBLEMS WITH MENTORS One of the top complaints about programs aimed at helping entrepreneurs is that they fail to pair people correctly. But I also heard that some of the programs lack focus and clear goals.
''If you don't have good chemistry, you could have a group discussion about spreadsheets but the business owners won't tell you that they don't get along with their No. 2 person,'' said Bernard H. Tennenbaum, former associate director of the Entrepreneurial Center at the Wharton School and the founding director of the entrepreneurial institute at Fairleigh Dickinson University. ''It's so important for these people to get along,'' he said.
The UBS-Clinton Foundation partnership aimed to avoid the common pitfalls by focusing on vetting both the mentor and the person being mentored. It also put a UBS financial adviser into the mix to help maintain clearly defined goals that could be accomplished in a short period of time.
''We knew from the Clinton Foundation why the business owners wanted to participate ahead of time and so we could make a better match,'' said Lori Feinsilver, who runs the program for UBS.
Still, Admiral Straw's experience got off to an inauspicious start. The owner of the first company he was supposed to help did not show up for the introductory lunch. But the next business proved to be a perfect match: Linda Tool, which manufactures precision components for military contractors.
Admiral Straw said that the Linda Tool plant in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn was much different from what he expected. The 12,000-square-foot shop was spotless, and the company had won industry certifications for the quality of its products. Michael DiMarino, its president, was managing his inventory, expenses and profits well. On the surface, it seemed as if there would be little for Admiral Straw to do.
But Mr. DiMarino said his big problem was that his business had stagnated after the 2008 financial collapse. ''I never had to do marketing,'' he said. ''The 1990s were fruitful years, and the business grew until it just stalled. But the price of everything else kept going up.''
Admiral Straw began advising him on how to bid directly with the Department of Defense and military contractors.
''I figured we could show him how to go directly to the federal government,'' Admiral Straw said. ''I took him to the Defense Logistics Agency and got him educated by the head of the small-business office on how to bid directly for the jobs.''
PROBLEMS WITH TIMING The timing of the Straw-DiMarino partnership was fortunate. Therese Flaherty, director of the Small Business Development Center at the Wharton School, said she had found that mentoring programs had the greatest impact when mentors came in at a point when the business owners were struggling with something that had stymied their original idea. This usually has something to do with finances or employees.
Mr. DiMarino said from 2008 to 2010 he worked hard not to lay off any of his employees. He said he was proud that many of his machinists had been with him for decades. But he had moved to a new, larger space and, he said, he was eager to figure out a way to increase his business since he had the capacity to do more work. Now that he is bidding directly for many contracts, he expects his sales to increase to $5 million this year from $3.8 million in 2011. His experience with Admiral Straw, in other words, has worked out well.
K. Y. Chow, who owns GM Printing, was also trying to expand his company. Over 18 years, he had won many city contracts for his printing company, but he moved into a larger plant in Long Island City just as the economy slowed. He wanted to know how to increase his sales beyond the contracts he had.
He was paired with Don Terwilliger, president of Digital Color Concepts, a much larger and more established printing company. ''The first question was, 'Tell me the problem I'm having,' '' Mr. Chow said. ''Is it pricing, quality, logistics?''
It was sales, since Mr. Chow was the only salesman. He has since hired two additional sales people.
DEFINING SUCCESS Mentoring programs often struggle to determine if they have accomplished anything. This is just as important for the mentors who are giving their time as the business owners who need help.
Julie Azuma, president of Different Roads to Learning, which sells more than 500 learning aids for children with autism, said she had been trying for two years to find a company that could translate her vision into an app that she could sell. She was feeling frustrated.
Yet Ms. Azuma, who has been part of many mentoring programs, said she had her doubts about the adviser and the entrepreneur assigned to help her.
''But after we met a few times,'' Ms. Azuma said, ''there was this feeling of accountability in working with them.''
Her mentors focused mainly on helping her create the app, but they also worked with her on improving the way she communicated her business goals. ''It was something she dreamed of, and we helped her make it a reality,'' said Amy Butte, a former Wall Street executive and Internet entrepreneur who was Ms. Azuma's mentor.
Ms. Butte and Ms. Azuma are still in touch. And this is something the program stressed: after the six months of formal work, the teams are expected to stay in contact for at least six months to help the business owners follow through on what they started.
(With the success of the New York program, Ms. Feinsilver said UBS was expanding it to Chicago and Los Angeles this spring, albeit with different partners.)
Admiral Straw said he had continued to help Mr. DiMarino, adding that he went with him recently to a job fair for veterans in Stamford, Conn. ''What really kept me in it was Mike's dedication and work ethic,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Who Doesn't Love A List?

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS. 
Charles M. Blow is off today.

 BODY:
The ONLY SIX THINGS you need to know right now about the presidential race:
1) People really like stories that promise you there are only six things they need to know about something. It gives them hope that if they just finish your list, you will leave them alone to think about other critical current event issues, or ''The Hunger Games.''
2) Rick Santorum appears to be the favorite in Saturday's Louisiana primary. 
Perhaps this oil-drilling, oil-spilling state likes his position on global warming. Which is that he has never believed in it. Never. Not even when he was in college and some of his friends would go out behind the fraternity house and do a little climate science. Young Rick preferred to stay in his room and look at pictures of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
''If you leave it to Nature, then Nature will do what Nature does, which is boom and bust,'' he said last month at an energy summit meeting in Colorado.
I believe I speak for many Americans when I respond: bust? What's this about a bust?
Also, at the same gathering, Santorum said that humans were put on Earth ''to use it wisely and steward it wisely, but for our benefit, not for the Earth's benefit.''
Right. Who cares what the Earth likes? If it isn't happy, let it just go sit in a corner and warm. See if we care.
3) There's been a lot of talk about Republicans suffering from primary fatigue. ''They are really kind of tired of this,'' Michele Bachmann told Joe Scarborough on MSNBC.
Perhaps Bachmann would like the Republicans to start concentrating on more important matters, like retiring her presidential campaign debt. We have heard a lot of complaints about how long and dreary these presidential contests have been, but they all seem totally wrongheaded.
The primaries have been great for the economy. Dimwitted billionaires are dumping money they don't need into the campaigns of people who can't win, providing much-needed jobs for ad-writers, poll-takers and yard-sign manufacturers.
Do you remember, at the depth of the recession, when Keynesians kept saying that we could jump-start the recovery by just paying a whole bunch of people to dig holes and fill them back in? This is exactly the same thing! Keep going, Republicans!
4) After the Louisiana primary is over, there will certainly be new calls for Newt Gingrich to get out of the race. Those doing the urging will point out that his campaign seems to be sunk in debt and that he's never going to win anything.
Sure, those are points. But, on the other hand, where do you want him to go? Home to sit in the basement? The man has nothing else to do. Be reasonable.
5) Democrats are getting so bored that they've started to speculate about whether Joe Biden will run in 2016.
Everyone is getting excited about the idea of a primary contest between Biden, who would be 73, and Hillary Clinton, who would be turning 69. Biden could match the Ronald Reagan presidential oldness record! We do worry a little about the age thing, since we all know that William Henry Harrison was sworn in at 68, caught a cold and died a month later. But the good news is that if Clinton or Biden wins, and then gets the sniffles while giving the Inaugural Address, the presidential physicians would probably not respond with bleeding and creating therapeutic blisters.
Timid souls might counsel that we shouldn't be thinking about 2016 before we've even had the conventions in 2012. They might throw out other names, like Andrew Cuomo, who has won the hearts of New Yorkers by being governor for more than a year without having anything terrible happen.
But, I say, what the heck. Let's just agree right now that we want a Clinton-Biden primary season next time around. We can talk about it constantly through the entire next administration, further convincing all Americans under the age of 50 that the older generation is never going to get out of the way and let them have the good jobs.
6) Unless Mitt Romney says a new strange thing this weekend, his opponents will continue to remind the world that a top Romney aide compared the candidate's campaign strategy to shaking up an Etch A Sketch.
I would recommend giving this one a rest, even though the aide's comment does speak to the fact that Romney will switch his position on anything, possibly including the number of states in the union, if he thinks it'll get him elected.
On the other hand, people really like Etch A Sketches. Thinking about them gives voters warm memories of childhood afternoons, whiled away with a primitive mechanical drawing toy. Really, if you want to make them irritated, better to go back to the dog on the car roof. Nobody likes thinking about that dog.

HEADLINE: Neighbors Join in Modest Efforts To Embrace Abandoned Properties

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
SOUTH BEND, Ind. -- When the grand Queen Anne on Portage Avenue lost its last occupants a few years ago, plunging into foreclosure and abandonment, the century-old gem risked the same fate as hundreds of empty houses here: collapse or demolition. Either way, what had been a lumber baron's masterpiece was bound to become just another forgotten lot on the Rust Belt.
This time, however, one group of people decided that they could not abide by the slow dance of architectural death. They were not real estate investors hoping to make a killing off this market, which is not even remotely on the upswing. They were its neighbors, come together against significant odds to save the house, and others like it, in the hope of saving their community.
A retired Army staff sergeant, two professors, a former newspaper copy editor, a painter and an interior decorator, among a several others, incorporated themselves to collectively purchase the 3,000-square-foot house for $9,500 at a foreclosure sale. Then they got to work. 
''It's a bootstrap operation of sweat equity,'' said David Hurley, a neighbor whose hands were mud-covered from planting a garden. ''It's important that the house look good, that's the point.''
In another time or place, the scene playing out last week could have been for an episode of ''Flip This House.'' But this is not Miami. Or San Francisco. This is South Bend, post industrial collapse, post recession. It suffered from the recent housing bust without ever enjoying a boom. The median household income is $34,700, and its poverty level is above the national average at 24 percent, according to the 2010 census.
Once, though, back when Henry Studebaker built his wagon factory-turned-car factory here, and when the Singer Sewing Company was based here, fabulous homes sprung from great wealth. Tudor mansions. Dutch colonials. Italianate manors. Craftsman-style bungalows.
These days, the neighbors know they will be lucky if they can sell the Portage Avenue house at all, much less make a big profit.
''The goal is to not have another great house torn down or turned over to a slumlord,'' said Joan Downs-Krostenko, a professor of history at Indiana University and president of the incorporated neighbors' group, Chapin Park Inc. ''Your quality of life, property value and security are directly affected by the condition of your neighbor's house. So we are here to take care of our neighbor's house.''
Sweat dotting her brow, Beth Kern, who would usually be teaching tax accounting at Indiana University, was sprawled on the pine floor, using her spring break to paint the wall space under the foyer window seat.
''It's a labor of love -- and vested interest,'' she said.
Residents in neighborhoods that make up the Near Northwest and West Side -- treasure troves of vernacular architecture -- describe what is happening to help solve the abandoned property problem as nothing short of ''a movement.'' Almost everyone knows someone who bought a deteriorating property on his or her block, with civic duty being part of the financial calculus.
''We've had this problem for a long time,'' said Mayor Pete Buttigieg. But, he added, ''I think there's definitely an uptick in people's readiness to be part of the solution.''
Not far from the Portage project, Kathy and John Oxian were checking last week on three vacant houses they purchased at recent tax sales -- one for as little as $750 -- to avoid the prospect of demolition on their block of Sancome Avenue. And Connie and Tom Tooley were clearing a lot they bought from the city for $25. Their hope is to create a pocket park adjacent to downtown.
A former mayor, Stephen Luecke, bought a foreclosed property on his street, two doors down from his own 100-year-old home on Leland Avenue. He fixed it up and rented it.
''One of the challenges here is that property is so affordable, it's hard to buy a house, fix it up and get back what you put into it,'' Mr. Luecke said. ''But we do have a core of people who love our old housing.''
Dr. Downs-Krostenko thinks the phenomenon goes a step beyond that: ''We don't live on a golf course with three-car garages. Your kitchen window looks into your neighbor's window, eight feet away. That old-fashioned topography helps foster a closeness that is completely lacking in modern developments.''
She also bought two other blighted houses -- one next door to where she lives. She said, ''I spent a lot of time looking outside my window thinking, 'I'm going to make that prettier one day.' ''
The neighbors know they are facing an uphill battle: they cannot possibly save every house. But at least for now, they are hoping to use whatever money is left over from the potential sale of the Portage Avenue house to finance the repair of another failing house. That way, the project pays itself forward.
(The dream asking price for 612 Portage Avenue? $85,000.)
In recent years, cities and counties across the country have increased their efforts to try to either maintain or demolish blighted properties in the wake of the mortgage foreclosure crisis. And federal programs designed to help stabilize neighborhoods are increasingly common -- indeed, several are active in South Bend alone. But what makes South Bend's methods interesting is the extent to which ordinary people of ordinary means are using their own hands and pocketbooks to be part of the solution to a complex problem.
The Oxians, who own a used furniture and rug cleaning business, keep the grass cut and the electricity on at their three empty properties. They put plants in the windows to give the appearance of something other than vacancy. They turn on a few small lights at night.
''It hasn't been an inexpensive proposition,'' said Kathy Oxian, 47. ''But the more you have invested in your neighborhood, the more you want to save what's there. If you don't make any effort, you may as well call it quits and move, and I'm not ready to do that.''
She added, ''It's not the answer to tear down every house.''
On a walking tour of Sancome Avenue, Ms. Oxian stopped into one of the houses the couple bought, a strapping ''four-square'' with crown molding and 10-foot ceilings. The city had favored tearing it down in 2010 for code violations and want of occupants. Ms. Oxian, the neighborhood watch captain, saw it as something else. ''We got together with the city and said, 'We'd like to save it.' I said, 'It's got good bones! Please let us try.' ''
''You see stuff like this,'' she said, pointing to missing plaster and a hole in the wall, ''this is what we call cosmetic. The house is solid. Why would you want to tear this down?''
With a $750 bid and promised code improvements, the Oxians saved the house, which they are slowly repairing with the help of friends and family. They hope to be able to rent it.
Mr. Oxian, a former teacher and an early activist in the local preservationist movement, said: ''If you come into a neighborhood and see an empty lot here and an empty lot there, you think, 'Hey, something's wrong with this place. This must not be a decent place.' We don't want to send that message.''
He added, ''This is still a nice place.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Saturday with an article about efforts in South Bend, Ind., to restore abandoned properties misstated the connection between Kathy Oxian and the vacant house she was shown with in her neighborhood. Ms. Oxian and her husband recently bought a vacant property near the abandoned home; they do not own it.

HEADLINE: Slogan Supply: 'All of the Above'? It's Taken, Says G.O.P.

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
As taglines go, ''All of the above'' is not exactly phenomenal, lacking the sex appeal of its energy-policy sister, ''Drill, baby, drill,'' and the historic resonance of, say, ''Where's the beef?'' It conjures a standardized test more than economic stimulus.
-But President Obama's use of the phrase to describe his current energy policy leanings - signaling yes to a combination of domestic drilling, alternative energy and conservation -- is driving Republicans nuts, because the phrase has been a product of their party's energy platform for years. 
They find it especially galling since Mr. Obama made moves to block, for now, part of the expansion of the Keystone XL pipeline.
Mr. Obama has used the phrase while visiting oil-rich areas of the country, and his administration is promoting it every chance it gets.
It is hard to know precisely how ''all of the above'' came to pertain to energy, although Senator John McCain and his running mate in 2008, former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, made good use of it in their presidential campaign, along with ''drill, baby, drill'' and that underdog maxim, ''mine, baby, mine.''
But it may well have been conceived in 2000 on the floor of the House, when Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of New York, gave a lengthy speech on energy, saying: ''We need to be exploring alternative energy sources, the use of coal, the use of hydroelectric power, of biomass, geothermal, photovoltaic, solar thermal and wind, utilizing ethanol, creating a system of electric reliability, increasing the exploration and supply of natural gas, and retrofitting or building cost-efficient oil refineries. In addition, we need to utilize government land for responsible oil and natural gas exploration.''
Mr. Gilman also said that the American Petroleum Institute at the time advocated ''that an effective national energy policy must, at a minimum, allow for all of the above.''
In 2007, other Republican members picked up the phrase, including Representative Zach Wamp of Tennessee, who called himself ''an all-of-the-above energy guy,'' to The Chattanooga Times Free-Press.
The phrase has been popularized by Republicans throughout the last decade but came into its own during the 2008 campaign, beginning on the Hill. ''There's no question that if we're ever going to begin to seriously move toward energy independence,'' said John A. Boehner, then the minority leader and now the speaker, ''which is good for our national security and, frankly, very good for our economy -- that we have to do all of the above.''
Clark Stevens, a White House spokesman, dismissed the issue of catchphrase appropriation, saying that Mr. Obama embodies the notion that Republicans popularized.
''By pursuing an energy agenda that is expanding domestic oil and gas production, with oil production at an eight-year high,'' he said, ''effectively doubling renewable energy from sources like wind and solar in his first term, providing funding for the first new nuclear power plant in 30 years, and investing in advanced technologies and R&D that will help America be a leader in the 21st-century energy economy, it's clear that from the beginning the president, unlike many who have used the phrase in the past, has actually embraced a true all-of-the-above approach.''
Domestic oil production has increased during the Obama administration, largely through the continuation of policies put in place by President George W. Bush.
But in the face of rising gas prices and increased criticism from Republicans, Mr. Obama, who has previously tried to keep his environmentalist base voters at bay on this issue, has begun to push his ''all of the above'' notions aggressively; this week, the White House announced in Oklahoma that it would expedite the southern half of the Keystone XL pipeline.
''We're pleased the president is now supporting Republicans' 'all-of-the-above' energy strategy with his words,'' said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, ''but his actions tell a different story. Blocking more American energy production on federal lands and offshore and personally lobbying against Keystone is the opposite of 'all of the above,' and the American people understand that.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: What Stocks and G.D.P. Say About Obama's Chances

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
AS the presidential election campaign heats up, two measures of the economic success of President Obama's administration provide drastically different views of how he has done.
His stock market record is among the best of all the administrations that have held office over the last century. But in terms of economic growth, the record is among the poorest. 
The accompanying chart measures the performance of the stock market and the economy under each administration since Woodrow Wilson was elected in 1912, adjusted for inflation. The measures cover the time from when a president took office until the following campaign got under way.
From the fourth quarter of 2008 through the final quarter of 2011, the American economy grew at an annual rate of just 1.4 percent. Of course, the economy declined during the first two quarters of 2009, reflecting the financial crisis and recession that began before Mr. Obama was elected, and has since recovered all of the decline and more. Nonetheless, over comparable periods, the economy performed better in 21 of the previous 24 administrations.
But since the presidential inauguration on Jan. 20, 2009, the stock market has risen at an annual rate of 16.4 percent, even after adjusting for inflation. That is better than all but four previous administrations.
It is highly unusual for the two measurements to differ so greatly, but there is one similar case. Nearly a century ago, President Wilson took office just as a recession was beginning. The stock market had plunged before he was inaugurated, and the eventual recovery in prices came on his watch. But the decline in the economy during 1914 was not fully overcome until 1916, when spending on World War I brought rapid growth.
World War II caused even greater dislocations in economic output, and means that there probably should be footnotes next to the fastest growth in the chart -- during Franklin Roosevelt's third term -- and the largest decline -- during the following administration as war spending ended.
In general, share prices seem to have had a better record as election forecasters. Nine previous administrations have produced double-digit percentage gains over the comparable period, and the incumbent party won in seven of the subsequent elections, the exceptions being Democratic defeats in 1952 and 2000. At the other end of the scale, only one incumbent, President Roosevelt running in 1940, was able to win despite substantial stock market losses.
President Obama may be able to take heart from the somewhat similar experience of President Wilson, who was able to claim credit for the recovery and pass off the blame for the recession as he won re-election in 1916. But the other two presidents with similar records of slow economic growth -- Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush -- each lost their re-election bids.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Among the Best Presidents or the Worst, in Economic Terms: Measured by stock market performance since he entered office, President Obama's administration has been among the most successful of the last hundred years. Measured by economic growth, it ranks near the bottom. The charts show the changes in gross domestic product for the first three years of each administration, and in the stock market from Inauguration Day through March 20 of the next election year. All figures are adjusted for inflation and annualized. (Sources: Dow Jones

HEADLINE: Taking Aim At Loopholes, In Theory

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Having touched the third rail of American politics last year -- proposed cuts to entitlements like Medicare -- and lived to fight another day, Representative Paul Ryan was back this week with a revised Republican budget proposal and another storm of criticism. His budget ''slashes the safety net to pay for tax cuts mostly for wealthy Americans''(a column in The Washington Post); is one in which ''the rich pay less in taxes than the unfairly low rates they pay now'' (an editorial in The New York Times); and ''would shower the wealthiest few Americans with an average tax cut of at least $150,000'' (the White House). 
As I worked on my own taxes this week and realized I may be paying even more than I did last year, when I paid 24 percent of my adjusted gross income in federal income tax and 37 percent in combined federal and state -- more, as I've reported, than the average 18 percent paid by the top 400 taxpayers earning an average of $270 million a year -- I found it hard to believe anyone would seriously propose cutting the already-low tax rates of the ultrawealthy. With multimillionaires like Mitt Romney paying just 13.9 percent of his $21.7 million of adjusted gross income in federal tax, how much lower can their rates go?
So I turned to Mr. Ryan's ''Path to Prosperity'' and its proposal for tax reform: ''The tax code is patently unfair: many of the deductions and preferences in the system -- which serve to narrow the tax base -- were lobbied for and are mainly used by a relatively small group of mostly higher-income individuals.'' These tax preferences amount to $1 trillion a year, the proposal states, and ''these tax preferences are disproportionately used by upper-income individuals. ...There's nothing fair about that.''
This is a conservative Republican document intended to cut taxes on the wealthy? To me it sounds like a proposal to raise their taxes by depriving them of cherished ''loopholes,'' to use the proposal's word.
Mr. Ryan wants two simple tax rates: 25 percent for higher incomes and 10 percent for lower incomes. He wants to abolish the alternative minimum tax, which has hit an ever-growing number of middle-class taxpayers, especially in high-tax states like New York and California. He wants the results to be revenue-neutral.
But there's no getting around the fact that a 25 percent rate on the top earners would nearly double Mr. Romney's effective rate and more than double it for the 101 of the top 400 taxpayers who pay less than 10 percent, assuming the loopholes are indeed closed. (The White House calculation that the Ryan plan would result in a tax cut for the wealthy assumes they won't be.) A top rate of 25 percent may sound like a cut from current higher rates, but so few wealthy taxpayers pay the top rate that it would be a significant increase for many of them.
I caught up with Mr. Ryan this week as he was on his way to a vote on the House floor. ''All I'm saying is, let's have a fair, simple and competitive system. Let's get beyond the rhetoric of class division,'' Mr. Ryan told me. ''The fact is that nearly all the loopholes and tax shelters benefit the top bracket taxpayers. For every dollar you park in a tax shelter, that dollar is taxed at zero. You take away the shelters, and we can have a lower rate for everybody. It's really that simple. As for fairness, under the current system you can have two people living next door to each other with the same income paying a dramatically different tax rate. There's something fundamentally wrong with that and we've got to fix it.''
Of course, one man's loophole or shelter is another's beneficial social policy. Just what those policies should be, and which of the current tax breaks would have to be sacrificed to pay for them, remains to be decided.
But Mr. Ryan said he believed everything should be on the table, even some of the Republicans' most cherished tax breaks. ''What we need is to get the country behind the principle first, which is to lower rates by broadening the tax base, then proceed to do it,'' he said. ''We need hearings in the light of day, with no back-room dealings. If we can't afford certain policies, or if we can't afford to retain certain tax breaks, then let's have an open debate about it. But let's do first things first. You can't go out there with a detailed formula until there's a consensus that we need to broaden the base and reduce rates.''
Despite Mr. Ryan's reluctance to specify which tax preferences might have to be curtailed or eliminated, there's no mystery as to what they would have to be. Looking only at the returns of the top 400 taxpayers, the biggest loophole they exploit by far is the preferential tax rate on capital gains, carried interest and dividend income. The top 400 taxpayers account for over 10 percent of all capital gains and nearly 5 percent of all dividend income reported by individual taxpayers.
''Unless they tax capitals gains and dividend income like ordinary income, the Ryan plan will be a massive tax cut for high-end taxpayers,'' said Leonard Burman, a tax expert and a professor of public affairs at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University. ''To modern Republicans, the idea that low capital gains rates spur growth is a religion. I doubt that even Mr. Ryan could get other Republicans to support that, but then, Ronald Reagan did it, so I suppose anything is possible.'' (Under President Reagan's tax reform legislation of 1986, capital gains were taxed at the same rate as ordinary income.)
The other big break for the richest taxpayers is the charitable contribution deduction; the 400 top taxpayers account for 4.55 percent of all charitable deductions. Reducing or eliminating other big breaks -- deductions for state and local taxes, the mortgage deduction, interest-paid deductions and miscellaneous deductions -- shifts the burden much further down the economic ladder. The top 400 taxpayers account for just 1.31 percent of all itemized deductions.
One of the largest tax breaks benefiting middle-income taxpayers is the exclusion from tax of the value of employer-provided health care benefits, (which costs the government $147.8 billion, more than any other tax break). And to broaden the base by an additional $1 trillion, as Mr. Ryan suggests, means that nearly all of these breaks would have to be sharply curtailed, if not eliminated.
Although Mr. Ryan has been branded a radical, many of his tax reform proposals have bipartisan support. Two major commissions -- the Debt Reduction Task Force headed by former Senator Pete Domenici, a Republican, and Alice M. Rivlin, head of the Office of Management and Budget under President Clinton, and the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform -- reached similar conclusions.
''He's a purist when it comes to tax reform and I admire him for that,'' Ms. Rivlin, now at the Brookings Institution, told me this week. ''With respect to the form of what he's proposing, I like it. He wants to broaden the base and bring the rates down and have a simplified rate structure. That general idea is embraced by many Democrats. The problem is, if you're going to bring rates down as far as he suggests, you have to make drastic reductions in tax expenditures and dearly loved ones at that, such as the home mortgage deduction and the exclusion of employer-paid health care from income tax. To get to revenue-neutral with rates that low, you have to phase out nearly all those big tax deductions, and he doesn't discuss the specifics of that.''
Dr. Rivlin also applauds Mr. Ryan's emphasis on the way tax preferences benefit the wealthy. ''He's done a very good thing here,'' she said. ''There's no question that those policies heavily favor the upper 1 percent, and certainly the upper 2 or 3 percent. If you're going to have tax reform, then you're going to have to increase the effective tax rate on the ultrawealthy.''
Mr. Ryan's tax proposals have drawn fire from the right as well as the left. Ron Paul called them ''very disappointing,'' and said both tax and spending rates should be much lower. Rick Santorum called the plan a ''great blueprint,'' but argued it failed to cut spending deeply enough. Mitt Romney has embraced the plan.
Mr. Ryan seemed unfazed by criticisms from both right and left when I spoke to him this week. ''I gave up fear for Lent two years ago,'' he said. ''I took over the budget committee in 2007. I was deeply involved in 2008, when we had the crash and the financial crisis. It was ugly. It caught us by surprise. I was in meeting after meeting talking about another Great Depression, a deflationary spiral, and I said, 'We better not let this happen again.' ''
Given the current budget deficit and its trajectory, he said, ''it's obvious we're headed for a cliff and now it's really close. This looming fiscal crisis is the most predictable one we've ever had. I feel from a moral standpoint you have to do everything you can to prevent it from hitting.''

HEADLINE: Utah Asks U.S. to Return 20 Million Acres of Land

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
DENVER -- The conservative political movement that has rallied behind the cry of states' rights in recent years on fronts including immigration and health care is now focusing its energies on a much older question in the American West: public lands.
On Friday, Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah, a Republican, signed into law House Bill 148. It asks the federal government, which owns a majority of the land in the state, to give back more than 20 million acres. A similar measure, passed by the Arizona Senate last month, is awaiting further action in the Capitol in Phoenix. Bills patterned after Utah's are being prepared for filing next year in Colorado, Idaho, Montana and New Mexico, lawmakers involved in the effort said.
Utah is also preparing lawsuits, for filing as early as next month, to reclaim thousands of sections of road that cross federal lands but that the state argues should properly be the province of the states and counties.
''This is not your father's sagebrush rebellion,'' said State Representative Ken Ivory, a Republican and chief sponsor of the Utah bill, referring to the wave of antifederal protests that rippled through the West in the 1960s and '70s. ''There are very sound legal bases for doing this.'' 
The federal government, Mr. Ivory and other proponents said, reneged on Congressional promises going back to the 1800s, which held that Washington's control of tens of millions of acres in the West in national forests, rangelands and parks was only temporary. That pledge, they say, was written into contractual obligations in the founding documents of many states, and was followed through in some places but not others. The Midwest and Plains states, for example, are now almost entirely private lands, but hop a meridian or two west and the picture changes completely.
In some ways, theirs is an old claim -- and critics say a musty one to boot. From the 1940s, when ranchers fumed over Franklin D. Roosevelt's new rules about the grazing of cattle on federal land, to the 1960s and '70s, when Nevada rose up to fight federal control over most of the state's lands, periodic waves of anti-Washington vitriol have flamed in legislatures and courthouses in resentment of control by far-away bureaucrats.
Those past efforts invariably went nowhere, falling to legal precedent and federal Constitutional provisions that say Congress holds all the cards when it comes to federal lands. Many legal experts say they expect the same result this time. The Utah Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel, which analyzes proposed legislation, told lawmakers that United States Supreme Court decisions in public lands cases going back to the 1870s gave H.B. 148, ''a high probability of being declared unconstitutional.''
Proponents said the new front line is different -- in its legal arguments, based on the language under which states were granted their founding charters, its scope in aiming to advance across multiple states on an allied front, and the context of a judicial landscape, including the current mix of justices on the Supreme Court, which believers say seems more receptive to states' rights assertions and skeptical of federal authority.
Mr. Ivory, the author of Utah's bill, said the great bulwark defense of the federal public lands in the past has been that they are the property of all Americans -- resources of national importance. But the opposite point, he said, is also perhaps more true and glaring than ever -- that more intensive economic development on public lands should be of national value as well.
''If we unleash those resources in a responsible, sustainable manner, that's a matter of national employment,'' Mr. Ivory said. ''That's a matter of national economic G.D.P. growth; that's a matter of national deficit and debt reduction.''
Election-year politics is adding further fuel. Mr. Herbert, who is running for election for the first time -- he took office in 2009, filling a vacancy -- is trying to fend off a political challenge from his right, led by Tea Party groups in Utah, and is facing his party's convention next month. And the national debate over energy and gas prices, which are becoming an element in the presidential election, has also sharpened proponents' arguments.
''If you look at a map of the United States, all the states in the East are private land,'' said Al Melvin, a Republican state senator who sponsored the bill in Arizona, where the federal government owns 48 percent of the land. ''That's why many of them are doing so well -- it's private land in Texas and North Dakota where they're drilling for oil and fracking for gas,'' he added. ''The 50 states are separate but not equal.''
Legal experts said the problem for the new state claims was that Congressional authority over federal land had been upheld over and over by the United States Supreme Court. If property rights are the issue being raised, many experts said, proponents of the new land drive are facing traditions and precedents that run deep in the law and culture.
''The core of it is that if somebody said to you, 'You don't own your house, I do,' you would pull out a deed -- that's what the federal government will do,'' said Professor Charles F. Wilkinson, who teaches federal public land law at the University of Colorado.
But Professor Wilkinson said the proponents have hit the nail on an issue that in many ways did create two different halves of the nation -- the private-property states and the public-lands states -- with tensions that have never really been resolved. ''Should the United States government continue to own so much in this capitalist society?'' he said. ''That question has never gone away.''
What happened in the West is partly that the landscape was just different from the beginning. Huge stretches of mountain terrain and parched desert did not lend themselves to successful homesteading, which tidied up the East and Great Plains states in mile after mile of tidy if monotonous surveyor's quadrants.
And by the time places like Utah were in line for statehood in the 1890s, ideas about conservation and potential future scarcity of natural resources -- especially timber in those days -- were becoming national priorities, leading to the first national forests beginning in the 1890s.
Fighters on the new public-lands front say the old formulas no longer hold. But they say that they have also learned what battles to avoid, and that some federal lands are in fact great to have around. The bills in Utah and Arizona exempt national parks, military installations and most national monument lands, for example -- all of which, especially the parks, have become major rural economic engines.

HEADLINE: A Personal Note As Obama Speaks On Death Of Boy

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and HELENE COOPER; Richard A. Oppel Jr. contributed reporting from West Monroe and Shreveport, La.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama did not mention race even as he addressed it on Friday, instead letting his person and his words say it all: ''If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.''
Weighing in for the first time on the death of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager shot and killed a month ago in Florida by a neighborhood watch volunteer, Mr. Obama in powerfully personal terms deplored the ''tragedy'' and, as a parent, expressed sympathy for the boy's mother and father.
''I can only imagine what these parents are going through. And when I think about this boy, I think about my own kids,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Every parent in America,'' he added, ''should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this and that everybody pulls together -- federal, state and local -- to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened.'' 
While speaking movingly from his perspective as the father of two girls, one a teenager, Mr. Obama notably made no reference to the racial context that has made the killing of Trayvon and the gunman's claim of self-defense a rallying point for African-Americans. Since Mr. Obama first began campaigning to be ''president of all the people,'' as his advisers would put it when pressed on racial issues, he has been generally reluctant to talk about race. And after his historic election as the first black president, Mr. Obama learned the hard way about the pitfalls of the chief executive opining on law enforcement matters involving civil rights.
His remark at a news conference in the summer of 2009 that a white police officer in Cambridge, Mass., had acted ''stupidly'' in arresting a black Harvard law professor, Henry Louis Gates Jr., at his home led to a national controversy that ended with Mr. Obama holding a peacemaking ''beer summit'' with the two men at the White House.
Until Friday, Mr. Obama had refrained from commenting on the death of Trayvon, 17, a high school student who was killed on the night of Feb. 26 in Sanford, Fla., near Orlando. George Zimmerman, 28, the neighborhood watch volunteer, said he fired at Trayvon in self-defense, although there is no apparent evidence that the teenager, who held only a bag of Skittles candy and an iced tea, was doing anything wrong.
But when a reporter asked about the case at a White House event introducing Jim Yong Kim as his choice to be president of the World Bank, Mr. Obama, who typically leaves such events ignoring the shouted questions of reporters, seemed prepared.
''It was inevitable given the high-profile nature of this story that he would be asked about it,'' his press secretary, Jay Carney, said later. He added that Mr. Obama ''had thought about it and was prepared to answer that question when he got it.''
Mr. Carney himself had refused for days to speak for Mr. Obama about Trayvon's death, and other advisers on Friday likewise declined to weigh in on the thinking at the White House about the case and its repercussions. Mr. Obama's mostly white male inner circle has long been reluctant to talk for their boss when the subject is race, given how personal it is for him. One aide, speaking only on the grounds of anonymity, said that there was no internal debate about how to respond to Trayvon's death, but that Mr. Obama wanted to await the Justice Department's initial review of the case and the announcement this week by his attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., that the civil rights division would investigate.
In his remarks, Mr. Obama endorsed the Justice Department investigation as well as efforts by local and state agencies in Florida to examine the circumstances of the shooting. Trayvon's parents ''are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves, and that we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened,'' Mr. Obama said.
The president indicated his caution in not reacting earlier was due to the hazards of addressing an issue under inquiry. ''I'm the head of the executive branch and the attorney general reports to me so I've got to be careful about my statements to make sure that we're not impairing any investigation that's taking place right now,'' he said.
The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader who organized a rally on Thursday night in Florida protesting the handling of the case and has been working with the Martin family, praised Mr. Obama's comments and took issue with black critics who say the president should have spoken out sooner.
''We're trying to win a case, not just have the president make high-profile statements,'' Mr. Sharpton said in an interview. ''As one who's been with the family, the president making a statement before the Justice Department announced an investigation could have been used by Zimmerman to say the White House was pre-judging a legal case.''
Charles J. Ogletree, an African-American law professor at Harvard who taught Mr. Obama there and remains a confidant, said there was no doubt the president had been moved by Trayvon's death. ''Nothing is more frightening for a parent than losing a child,'' Professor Ogletree said. ''I know personally that he felt this pain, from the moment he was made aware of the case.'' He added: ''He has two young daughters. This is personal.''
Mr. Carney said he could not say whether Mr. Obama planned to call Trayvon's parents, as some black activists have urged. Boyce D. Watkins, a Syracuse University professor and the founder of the Your Black World coalition, said Friday in a Twitter message, ''If Trayvon's mother were white, would Obama give her a call?''
Dr. Watkins, in an interview, called Mr. Obama's statement ''a step in the right direction,'' but added that the president could ''squash a great deal of the criticism'' with a call to the parents. And while applauding Mr. Obama's comment that his own son would look like Trayvon, Dr. Watkins said the president's remarks were characteristic of how Mr. Obama talks to black people.
''That's what I would refer to as a standard political smoke signal that President Obama sends through the back door to the black community,'' Dr. Watkins said. ''He communicates to the black community in code language. That's a subtle way of saying, 'I know this kid is black.' ''
Mr. Obama's comments appeared to prompt several of the Republicans campaigning to run against him to weigh in against the shooting for the first time. Both Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum said that based on what they knew, Florida's ''Stand Your Ground'' self-defense law should not apply in Mr. Zimmerman's case.
Speaking publicly for the first time on Friday evening, Craig A. Sonner, Mr. Zimmerman's lawyer, said on CNN that he would not use the Stand Your Ground defense should his client be charged in the shooting. He said he would use self-defense.
Mr. Santorum, campaigning at a shooting range in Louisiana, which holds a presidential primary on Saturday, called the decision of local officials not to immediately prosecute Mr. Zimmerman ''another chilling example of horrible decisions made by people in this process.'' Mitt Romney, the Republican front-runner, told reporters in Louisiana that the shooting was ''a terrible tragedy, unnecessary, uncalled for and inexplicable at this point.''
