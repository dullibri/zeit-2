HEADLINE: Conspiracy World

 BODY:
When Republicans began questioning President Obama's birth certificate four years ago, it seemed at first like a petulant reaction to a lost election, a flush of nativist and racist anger that would diminish over time. But the preposterous charges never went away. As this election cycle shows, many in the Republican Party continue to see the president as the center of a broad and malevolent liberal conspiracy to upend the truth.
To live and seethe in that world of conspiracy theories means rejecting any form of objective reality. When unemployment numbers make the administration look good, they are obviously ''cooked.'' When poll numbers put Mr. Obama ahead, they are skewed. Birth certificates are forgeries. Safety-net programs are giveaways to supporters. Health insurance reform is socialism. And campaign donation disclosure is antibusiness.
It's an upside-down version of life, and it is not innocuous. When desperation leads political critics of the president to discredit important nonpolitical institutions -- including the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal Reserve and the Congressional Budget Office -- the damage can be long-lasting. If voters come to mistrust the most basic functions of government, the resulting cynicism can destroy the basic compact of citizenship.
Last week, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate had fallen to 7.8 percent, depriving Mitt Romney of his standard talking point that the rate had never been below 8 percent during Mr. Obama's term. No one expected Republicans to celebrate a positive trend for the country, but almost immediately the anchors on Fox News and the editors of right-wing Web sites saw something more sinister: a conspiracy, led by the Obama campaign, to manipulate the numbers to make the president look good a month before the election.
The charge was absurd. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which along with the Census Bureau conducts the underlying household survey, is run by career civil servants and is impervious to political pressure and manipulation, as all but the hypnotized in Washington understand. But, this time, the conspiracy theorists went beyond the usual suspects. Jack Welch, the former chief executive of General Electric, said Mr. Obama's Chicago staff obviously changed the numbers, though he had no evidence of chicanery beyond the outrageous charge that the numbers came from an ''ideologue division of the federal government.''
To Mr. Welch and his fellow cynics, the facts were inconvenient, so they had to be wrong. And not just wrong, but deliberately so. That's the same mentality that led ideologues last month to accuse independent pollsters of deliberately skewing polls to show Mr. Obama ahead, though no such charges are emerging now that Mr. Romney is improving in the polls. And this trend is reinforced when people who know better, like Newt Gingrich and Senator John McCain, trash the civil servants at the State Department and the Congressional Budget Office. (Mr. Romney, to his credit, did not question the latest jobless figures.)
Democrats aren't happy about the latest polls, but they aren't suggesting Mr. Romney is manipulating them, just as they didn't undermine the Bureau of Labor Statistics when the jobless numbers were high. Many are far more worried about a conspiracy that is verifiable and serious: the concerted effort by Republicans over the last four years to deprive minorities, poor people and other likely Democratic supporters of their voting rights.
That, of course, doesn't seem to bother those who see ''Chicago's'' evil hand everywhere. When there is real-world evidence of political collusion, the conspiracy theorists are nowhere to be found.

HEADLINE: The Baby Boom and Economic Recovery

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Post-recession levels of employment may be affected as much by demographics as by the nation's economic policies, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "." 
Thanks in part to the baby boom, the employment-population ratio understates the amount that the economy has recovered.
Before the recession began, 63 of every 100 people age 16 and over were employed. The percentage plummeted to 58.4 by the fourth quarter of 2009 and hasn't moved far from there since.
A variety of economists have used the ratio and its dynamics to indicate that the economy has hardly recovered. Some say the employment-population ratio's lack of recovery is because of insufficient government spending; others suggest that it might reflect policy failures of the Obama administration.
But the employment-population ratio is influenced by important factors beyond the control of the president. One of them is the aging of the baby boomers. The employment-population ratio was expected to fall as baby boomers reached retirement ages between 2008 and 2015, even without a recession. For this reason alone, a full recovery would mean an employment-population percentage of about 61.

Although much attention last week was given to the August-to-September increase in part-time employment, the average hours worked among private-sector employees have increased sharply since 2009 and are now about the same as they were before the recession began.
The chart below shows a recovery when the quantity of labor is measured in terms of hours worked per capita (gray) or age-adjusted hours worked per capita (red). Both indexes are set to 100 in December 2007; the age adjustment is taken from my book on the labor market since 2007.
The red series hits bottom at 90.8 and now stands at 94.4. Unlike the employment-population ratio's negligible recovery, the age-adjusted hours series has recovered about 40 percent - four points - in three years.
To be sure, an additional six points of the recovery still remain, and the labor market continues to be depressed by public policies enacted over the last four to eight years. But some of these policies, such as mortgage assistance, the three increases in the federal minimum wage and the federal rules giving states more flexibility to expand food-stamp participation were begun before President Obama took office and probably would not have been overturned if John McCain had won the 2008 election. Some of those policies had broad political support.
Thanks to demographic and political changes, a full labor market recovery may be beyond any president's reach.

HEADLINE: Diaz and Caro Among Finalists for National Book Award

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: The high-profile nominees indicate that the National Book Foundation took to heart the criticism that previous nominations went to obscure works. 

 BODY:
 9:26 a.m. | Updated Junot Díaz, fresh from being awarded a "genius'' grant by the MacArthur Foundation last week, received another honor on Wednesday when he was named a finalist in the fiction category for the National Book Awards.
The foundation also posthumously nominated Anthony Shadid, the New York Times foreign correspondent who died earlier this year while on a reporting assignment in Syria. Mr. Shadid was selected in the nonfiction category for his memoir, "House of Stone: A Memoir of Home, Family, and a Lost Middle East."
Mr. Díaz, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his first novel, ""The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao," was nominated for "This Is How You Lose Her," a collection of connected short stories.
The National Book Foundation, which presents the awards, appears to have taken to heart the criticism from previous years that its nominations went to obscure works that sold few copies. In addition to Mr. Díaz, two of the five nominees are well-known literary names, and three of the finalists appeared on the cover of The New York Times Book Review this year.
The other nominees for fiction were Dave Eggers for "A Hologram for the King"; Louise Erdrich for "The Round House"; Ben Fountain for "Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk"; and a debut novelist, Kevin Powers, for "The Yellow Birds."
The foundation also showed a preference for fiction that addressed the fault lines of modern American life. "A Hologram for the King" follows a business consultant who tries to fend off foreclosure, raise money to pay his daughter's college tuition and redeem his fortune after being battered by the recession. "Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk" and "The Yellow Birds" both deal with fallout from the Iraq war.
In the nonfiction category, the foundation continued the trend of nominating prominent authors, including Robert A. Caro, for "The Passage of Power: The Years of Lyndon Johnson," the fourth installment in Mr. Caro's long-running biography of the president. Katherine Boo, the New Yorker staff writer, was named for "Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death, and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity," her account of three and a half years spent with the residents of Annawadi, an Indian slum. The other nonfiction nominees in addition to Mr. Shadid were Anne Applebaum, the Washington Post columnist, for "Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe, 1945-1956" and Domingo Martinez for "The Boy Kings of Texas."
Nominated in the category for poetry were David Ferry, for "Bewilderment: New Poems and Translations"; Cynthia Huntington, for "Heavenly Bodies"; Tim Seibles, for "Fast Animal"; Alan Shapiro, "Night of the Republic"; and Susan Wheeler, for "Meme."
In the young people's literature category, the finalists were William Alexander for "Goblin Secrets"; Carrie Arcos for "Out of Reach"; Patricia McCormick for "Never Fall Down"; Eliot Schrefer for "Endangered"; and Steve Sheinkin for "Bomb: The Race to Build - and Steal - the World's Most Dangerous Weapon."
A full list of the nominees appears here.
The winners, chosen by panels of authors in each category, will be announced Nov. 14 at a ceremony at Cipriani Wall Street in Lower Manhattan. That night, the foundation will also present its medal for distinguished contribution to American letters to Elmore Leonard, the novelist, and its Literarian Award for outstanding service to the American literary community to Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., chairman and chief executive of The New York Times Company.

HEADLINE: Those Snowy Slopes, Sprayed With Wastewater

BYLINE: LESLIE MACMILLAN


HIGHLIGHT: As an Arizona resort prepares to blow snow made from waste and water, a new study warns of possible contaminants. 

 BODY:
As I wrote in The Times recently, a ski resort in northern Arizona will become the first in the world to make artificial snow totally out of sewage effluent this winter. Last February, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of the resort, Arizona Snowbowl, ending a 10-year legal battle waged by environmental and Native American groups that warned that the wastewater snow would damage wildlife, human health and a mountain considered sacred by 13 Indian tribes.
Now, apart from longstanding concern about harmful chemicals in the water that will be used to make that snow - piped directly from the sewage treatment system of the nearby town of Flagstaff - new research indicates that the wastewater system is a breeding ground for antibiotic-resistant genes.
The genes were not detectable in the plant itself but "increased dramatically" at the point of use, meaning that they were found in places like sprinkler heads, the study said. "This means bacteria is growing in the distribution pipes," said Amy Pruden, the author and an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech.
The study has not been published or peer-reviewed, but Flagstaff officials are taking it seriously enough to have invited Dr. Pruden to serve on an advisory panel that the city formed last week. 
Antibiotic-resistant genes are an area of emerging concern to scientists because they impede the body's ability to fight disease.

Dr. Pruden suggested that the next step would be to analyze the live bacteria that might be carrying those genes through the pipes. She said the initial findings were cause for concern but that such worries "would shift to alarm" if known antibiotic-resistant pathogens were found in the water. Bacteria can cause infections in broken skin, and there is a high likelihood of cuts and scrapes during skiing, she pointed out.
Snowbowl's general manager, J.R. Murray, noted that trace levels of chemicals and contaminants were routinely found in ordinary drinking water. The plan to convert sewage to snow "is not so futuristic," he said. "It's just a sign of the times."
The reality of climate change, prolonged drought, decreasing water supplies and an expanding population make water recycling and conservation more important than ever, experts say. But, unlike drinking water, reclaimed water is regulated not by the federal government but at the state level. A lack of mandates often leaves cities and towns to grapple with the issue of how to manage their water resources while balancing the emerging science against business or economic interests.
"Scientists are now able to detect things in minute amounts that they were never able to detect before," said J.R. Murray, Snowbowl's general manager. "That doesn't mean those substances are harmful." 
Taylor McKinnon of the Center for Biological Diversity, a conservation group, counters that water use has exploded amid broad uncertainties. "The science is ahead of the policy, but our water use is way ahead of both," he said. He cited the multiplying swimming pools, golf courses and turf lawns in desert cities like Phoenix.
Whether to wait for the policy to catch up to the science or forge ahead with planned development is a matter of intense debate.
Arizona Snowbowl sits on public land managed by the United States Forest Service. Before approving Snowbowl's request, the agency conducted an environmental impact assessment in 2004 that deemed the water safe for snow-making because it satisfied a federal statute - the National Environmental Policy Act -- that does not specifically police any of the chemical compounds that have since been found in the water.
Flagstaff officials say they went above and beyond the federal study by commissioning one of their own in 2005 that found endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the water.
The Arizona Daily Sun reported last month that Flagstaff may develop new water treatment standards, including removing contaminants not currently regulated by state or federal law.
Meanwhile, Snowbowl's guns are set to spray the wastewater snow this Thanksgiving.

HIGHLIGHT: Metropolitan Diary: A mother hauling a cello case on her back puts a price on her burden. 

 BODY:
Dear Diary:
From the School for Strings on West 54th Street, a petite mom and her daughter exit. The girl has a child-size violin case slung over one shoulder, while mom has a full-size cello case strapped to her back.
 Suddenly, I spot a pair of dollar bills lying on the sidewalk between us, as does a smartly dressed woman coming from the opposite direction. Assuming they belong to the string players, she scoops up the money and calls back to them, "Did you drop these?" The viola-lugging mom turns quickly, shakes her head, and keeps walking. 
 I continue behind mom and daughter and hear the following exchange:
 Daughter: "How do you know the money wasn't yours?"
 Mom: "It was already on the sidewalk when we walked by."
 Daughter: "It was?" (Mom nods.) "So if you saw it, why didn't you pick it up?"
 Mom: "With this thing on my back, I don't bend over for anything less than a five."

HEADLINE: Fed Governor Suggests Congress Weigh Laws to Limit Bank Size

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: In a wide-ranging speech at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, Daniel K. Tarullo, of the Fed's board of governors, said Congress could set limits to ensure that institutions aren't "too big to fail." 

 BODY:
A Federal Reserve Board governor on Wednesday suggested that Congress could take steps to limit the size of banks in order to ensure financial stability.
In a wide-ranging speech at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, Daniel K. Tarullo, of the Fed's board of governors, said that limiting the size would help ensure that institutions aren't "too big to fail" and thus require future bailouts in order to protect the financial system. Although new rules like the Dodd-Frank Act have addressed risks in the banking industry, such rules have not set standards on how big is too big.
If Congress "chooses to do so, there would be merit in its adopting a simpler policy instrument, rather than relying on indirect, incomplete policy measures such as administrative calculation of potentially complex financial stability footprints," Mr. Tarullo said, according to prepared remarks.
He suggested one appropriate measure could involve limiting "the nondeposit liabilities of financial firms to a specified percentage of U.S. gross domestic product."
It is unclear whether Congress will ever take up such a measure. In his speech, however, he addressed some overhauls that are before various agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr. Tarullo blamed the world of so-called shadow banking, or other activities outside of traditional bank business such as lending and deposits, for some of the potential problems among financial institutions. He also threw his weight behind efforts to regulate money-market funds - efforts that have been stymied at the Securities and Exchange Commission but which Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has recently backed.
"As many of us in the government have pointed out, money market funds remain a major part of the shadow banking system and a key potential systemic risk even in the postcrisis financial environment," Mr. Tarullo said.
Mr. Tarullo described the difficulty that the Federal Reserve faces when evaluating whether to approve large bank mergers. "There is no statutory basis for identifying a certain systemic footprint above which the risks to financial stability are not worth bearing compared to whatever possible benefits may be associated with the operation of the largest, most interconnected firms," he said.

HEADLINE: In California, High Gas Prices and Incentives for Fuel-Efficient Cars Go Hand in Hand

BYLINE: JIM WITKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Significant discounts on the Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Volt and other advanced-powertrain vehicles are making high gas prices easier to bear for some Californians. 

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO - With a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline flirting with $5 through much of California, many people might expect a reprise of 2008, when the state joined much of the country in turning away from gas guzzlers and toward compact cars and hybrids. But according to some dealers around the Bay Area, though gas prices are pushing consumers toward the greener sections of their showrooms, a number of incentives are doing their part, too.
This month, Nissan began an incentive program in California that provided dealers with $4,500 to use at their discretion to move the purely electric Leaf off their lots. This enticement, along with high gas prices, has generated uncommon interest in the E.V., according to James Livesay, a sales manager at Nissan Sunnyvale.
"We've definitely seen an uptick, but I wouldn't say it's 100 percent because of the gas prices," Mr. Livesay said. "A lot of it has to do with the incentives on the vehicle, but the gas prices don't hurt." Mr. Livesay said the dealership sold 10 Leafs last weekend, compared with 24 in all of September.
The Leaf is already eligible for a maximum $7,500 federal tax credit and a $2,500 state rebate, making the potential savings with the manufacturer's incentive substantial.
At Northbay Nissan in Petaluma, Ron Coury, the director of e-commerce, said customers were expressing more interest in the Leaf in recent weeks. "Normally, I would get one or two calls a week about the Leaf. Now it's five a day," he said. He appreciated the dealer incentive offered in California, allowing him to lower the sticker price of the car, but he did not discount the effect of prices at the pump, which reached a statewide average of $4.66 last Sunday.
"It's pretty quiet out here in the E.V. world when gas prices are reasonable, but whenever you see a price jump the phones start ringing," he said.
Aggressive lease deals, combined with high gas prices, are raising interest in the Chevrolet Volt at Capitol Chevrolet in San Jose, said Robert Perez, an Internet sales manager and Volt specialist. "I had a customer last night come in for that reason," he said. "She told me gas prices for her commute were getting too high as part of her monthly expenses."
The uptick in interest is being borne out by sales as well. "We were selling on average 50 to 70 Volts a month, but this past weekend we sold 15, with most of those being leases," Mr. Perez said. On its Web site, the dealership advertises a $3,000 manufacturer's discount for some Volt models.
The highly anticipated Ford C-Max Hybrid reached dealer lots here in the last few weeks. "Timing-wise, it couldn't be better," said Joseph Guadagne, a sales and leasing associate at Walnut Creek Ford. "People are coming in looking for smaller economy cars, and I'm having a lot more conversations with customers who are putting gas mileage first and foremost."
Until the Honda Fit EV was certified by the Environmental Protection Agency at the electric equivalent of 118 miles per gallon, the purely electric Mitsubishi i-MiEV was officially the most efficient mass-produced passenger car on the American market. Larry Judge, a sales manager at Concord Mitsubishi, said he noticed a spike in interest over the last three weeks, which coincided with the run-up in gas prices. "We definitely have a lot more people researching and taking a look at it," he said. Concord Mitsubishi lists a dealer discount of $1,046 on the i-MiEV, in addition to state and federal incentives.
More than one conversation with customers, though, led Mr. Judge to conclude that buyers may wait until after the presidential election to buy a car, citing the election's potential to affect gas prices. "People are getting their information lined up, then waiting for next month and depending on how that goes, that's when I think you could see sales kick in," he said.
Californians may not have to wait that long to see prices change at the pumps. On Sunday, Gov. Jerry Brown called on the state's Air Resources Board to take action to increase the state's gasoline supply and bring down prices.

HEADLINE: Report Predicts Fastest Job Growth in Hotels and Restaurants, Not Financial Services

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: Since the recession ended, a steady increase in tourism in New York City has fueled steady job growth in hotels and restaurants, while Wall Street has been shedding jobs. 

 BODY:
 By the middle of the coming decade, there will be more jobs in New York City in hotels and restaurants than on Wall Street and in banks, according to a report on global competition released on Wednesday.
 Along with London, New York still ranks above other big cities around the world in its attractiveness to businesses and jobs, the report states. But it also predicts that the fastest job growth in New York will come in sectors that traditionally pay less and offer fewer chances for advancement.
 Since the recession ended, a steady increase in tourism in New York has fueled steady job growth in hotels and restaurants, while Wall Street has been shedding jobs. The report, "Cities of Opportunity 2012", from PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Partnership for New York City, projects that employment in the city's hotels and restaurants will continue to grow, edging above the number of jobs in financial services in the city by 2025. 
 By then, each of those sectors will account for about one out of every 11 jobs in the city. Business services, which now supplies nearly one-fifth of all of the city's jobs and has been leading the rebound in the last year, is projected to grow very little over the next dozen years, the report shows. (The sector encompasses a wide range of titles, some glamorous, others less so, including investment banker, insurance agent and bank teller.)
 Kathryn S. Wylde, the chief executive of the partnership, an association of the city's largest private employers, said the expectation "that the industry is flattening out is definitely going to have a negative pull on incomes" that city leaders will have to try to solve by developing other sectors that pay well.
 The report, which ranks cities on a variety of characteristics that matter to corporate executives, concluded that New York and London were in a virtual tie at the top. Last year, New York ranked first overall.
 But Ms. Wylde said city officials and business leaders were less concerned about London as a competitor than they were before the financial crisis.
 "At this point, we think of London and New York very much facing parallel challenges of retaining our status and retaining the West's status as the financial capital of the world," Ms. Wylde said. The challenge, she said, will be "whether New York and London can retain an edge over the emerging financial centers in the developing world."
 Indeed, the report projects that the number of jobs in financial services in Beijing will double by 2025.

HEADLINE: How in the World Will We Care for All the Elderly?

BYLINE: JUDITH GRAHAM


HIGHLIGHT: People are living longer than ever before and posing caregiving challenges that span the globe. 

 BODY:
All over the world, people are living longer than ever before and posing caregiving challenges that span the globe.
We think of this phenomenon as particularly true of wealthy "first world" countries like the United States. But it's not.
Consider these facts, drawn from a fascinating new portrait of global aging published by the United Nations Population Fund: 
Developing countries in Africa, Asia and other regions are experiencing the most rapid aging of their populations, not developed countries like those in Europe or North America. "Today, almost two in three people aged 60 or over live in developing countries, and by 2050, nearly four in five will live in the developing world," the report says. (While 60 isn't considered an entry point into older age here, it's the cutoff used by the United Nations.) Developing countries are also seeing the fastest growth in the ranks of the "oldest old" -- in this report, those 80 years old and above. By 2050, an estimated 280 million people in developing countries - most of them women, who tend to live longer than men - will be in this category, compared with 122 million in developed regions. Of course, this is the population group most likely to become frail by virtue of age and illness and to require the greatest assistance.
Here are some other facts that made my head spin: Almost 58 million people worldwide will turn 60 this year. By 2050, there will be more old people than children under the age of 15 for the first time in history.
It's hard to wrap one's mind around a demographic change of this magnitude and the caregiving challenges that it entails.
The true nightmare prospect is this: People live longer, with more chronic illnesses like high blood pressure or diabetes, in poorer health, requiring more attention from family members and costly medical care.
Should the globalization of aging follow that path, the strains on governments and families will be extraordinary and potentially devastating.
The best picture is this: People live longer, in good health, remaining productive, valued members of society who contribute in workplaces, communities and families through their later years, and are treated respectfully and supported economically and socially as they become frail.
The authors of the United Nations report argue that those goals are achievable, with well-thought-out policies and a firm commitment to care for the elderly while taking advantage of their wisdom, skills and experience.
But data in the report speaks to the enormous scope of this challenge. Witness this nugget: "Worldwide, more than 46 percent of people aged 60 years and over have disabilities and more than 250 million older people experience moderate to severe disability."
Which conditions top the list in developing countries? Visual impairments like cataracts, glaucoma, refractive errors and macular degeneration, which currently affect 94.2 million people, hearing loss (43.9 million people), osteoarthritis (19.4 million) and ischemic heart disease (11.9 million).
Who will take care of older adults with these problems? Once it was a given that families would do so in the developing world, where nearly three-quarters of adults live in intergenerational households rather than on their own, which is the norm in the United States and Europe.
But as middle-aged adults leave rural areas for economic opportunities in the city - this is happening in Africa, large parts of China and other regions - older adults are left behind to tend to grandchildren and take care of themselves as best they can, without the aid of adult children.
"Informal support systems for older persons are increasingly coming under stress as a consequence, among others, of lower fertility, out-migration of the young, and women working outside the home," the United Nations report observes.
What this means is that the old are taking care of the old in many instances. 
Japan is currently the oldest country in the world, the only one where elders represent more than 30 percent of the total population. There, about 60 percent of so-called informal caregivers (friends or relatives who care for older people voluntarily, without being paid) are 50 or older. 
"This percentage can be expected to increase steeply over the coming decades as a consequence of population aging," the United Nations report says.
Thirty-eight years from now, 64 countries will stand alongside Japan with seniors exceeding 30 percent of their total populations.
It's no surprise that the United Nations Population Fund reiterates the need for greater support for caregivers of the elderly. Progress is being made, it notes, with some countries (the Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Canada) introducing paid "allowances" for caregivers, others passing laws supporting caregivers (Japan, Finland and Sweden) and still others developing national strategies relating to caregiving (Australia, New Zealand and Britain) But the needs outstrip resources being made available, in those nations, as well as here.
Countries around the world a decade ago developed a framework, known as the Madrid International Plan of Action on Aging, to respond to these trends and others, and a meeting is being held on Wednesday in New York to discuss the progress they're making.
No one suggests enough is being done. But increasingly, there's an awareness that the aging of the globe doesn't lie off on the horizon: It's a reality, here and now, and unfolding at breathtaking speed.
Enlightened policies, including those dealing with caregiving, may make a great difference in the experience of older adults in the years to come. Stasis and a failure to envision new ways of responding to these demographic shifts, both here in the United States and in the world that surrounds us, no longer seem an option, but the way ahead remains unclear.

HEADLINE: The Global Arbitrage of Online Work

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: Online staffing companies, which connect freelancers with remote clients for software and accounting jobs, say they are booming. The trend could change everything from qualifications for hiring to how countries tax workers. 

 BODY:
If you thought it has been tough to find good work over the last couple of years, just wait.
The old problem was a bad economy, the kind of thing that ends. Trends suggest that we're heading for a global online arbitrage of opportunity, however, with good workers in bad places able to snatch business away from better-performing environments. If that happens in large numbers, the competition will get really fierce for everyone.
Recently two of the biggest online staffing companies, oDesk and Elance, have released surveys concerning the companies that hire workers over the Internet to do things like write software, and the mindset of online workers themselves.
Between them, oDesk and Elance claim to have more than four million coders, Web designers, marketing professionals and other workers. Some even spot porn on Facebook at a rate of four for a penny. In the second quarter of 2012, oDesk says, its contractors worked over 8.5 million hours, a 70 percent increase over a year earlier. The average freelancer at Elance, meantime, expects to make 43 percent more money in 2013, as more employers come online.
Taken together, the reports indicate a lot of growth ahead in the business, and a lot of talented people looking for work wherever they can find it. oDesk, which surveyed over 2,800 companies that used its service, found that 10 percent of these buyers were college students, and 58 percent described their companies as start-ups.
Not all those young companies will survive, but the habit of hiring online seems baked in; 64 percent of respondents said at least half of their work force would be online by 2015, and 94 percent predicted that in 10 years most businesses would consist of online temps and physical full-time workers.
The range of jobs done online is increasing, too. Workers on Elance said the highest-growing job categories in 2013 would be Web programming, making mobile applications, design, marketing and content writing. oDesk respondents were heavily in those categories too, but also saw employment in customer service, secretarial work and high-level technology development.
"As we move along, we see an increase in all the categories of work," said Gary Swart, the chief executive of oDesk. "We now have lawyers, accountants, financial executives, even managers." The only work unlikely to go online is immediate physical work, like plumbing, he said, adding, "but even a plumber needs an accountant."
What he doesn't need, apparently, is an accountant anywhere nearby. Some 30 percent of the United States citizens working on oDesk are working for overseas companies, Mr. Swart said. An even greater number of overseas people are probably working for Americans, too. In interviews, both companies say the continuing economic troubles in Europe are driving more people to online employment. oDesk has seen a 78 percent growth in hours billed by companies in Britain this year, even though it has never had much of a presence there.
The online work is already changing how some governments think about labor. Last May the government of Bangladesh decided to classify online work as export-related commercial income, free of taxes, instead of as a taxed offshore remittance.
The idea, Mr. Swart said, is to foster the growth of online workers. In other words, if you're reading this from one of the better parts of the global economy, it's a good time to think about how to be indispensable.
Another interesting wrinkle from the oDesk survey: Education alone probably won't help you get hired. Only 6 percent of the survey respondents rated schooling as a "very important" reason to hire someone. It was the lowest-rated reason to hire someone. Work experience was first, followed by how other people rated the contractor, pay, portfolio of work, references, and scores on skills tests that oDesk offers online.
In the future, having a degree may be helpful, but having a reputation will be even better.

Amisco Technologies, an auto parts maker with plants in coastal China, bought two Michigan factories with 500 workers but shut them down in 2007. Amisco is now owned by Bain Capital, Sharon LaFraniere and Mike McIntire report. That and other China-related holdings by Bain funds in which Mitt Romney has invested seem to contradict his campaign-trail complaint that China's manufacturing juggernaut is costing America jobs.

        
After Mr. Romney's gain in the polls, a Big Bird ad from President Obama's campaign was not the rebuttal nervous supporters were hoping for, Jim Rutenberg and Jeff Zeleny report. But the ad was just one element in a broader effort to reassure Democrats and show that any sense of complacency within the campaign is now gone.

        
Campaigns are not having much success controlling how television networks show their candidates during debates, especially the dreaded split-screen and reaction shots, which have long bedeviled presidential candidates who sometimes forget that they are on camera even when they are not speaking, Jeremy W. Peters reports.

        
In 2008, a strong black turnout that voted almost exclusively for President Obama helped turn North Carolina blue for the first time in decades, Susan Saulny reports. But times have changed, enthusiasm is down, unemployment is up and it remains unclear what effect those developments will have on the 2012 race, where a small drop-off in blacks' support could have an outsize impact.

HEADLINE: BAE and EADS Merger Talks Disintegrate

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT and NICOLA CLARK


HIGHLIGHT: The aerospace giants EADS and BAE Systems ended mergers talks on Wednesday after political haggling between European governments killed the deal. 

 BODY:
An effort to create a European behemoth in aerospace and military manufacturing to rival Boeing of the United States has collapsed amid political divisions involving Britain, France and Germany.
In a statement just hours before a Wednesday deadline set by British authorities, BAE Systems of Britain and European Aeronautic Defense and Space, or EADS - the parent of Airbus - said that despite having presented a merger plan based on "sound industrial logic," officials from the three governments could not agree on ownership and industrial structure.
At a time when unity among European governments has been of critical importance as the Continent grapples with its debt crisis, the failure of the deal exposed how competing national considerations can get in the way of cross-border cooperation.
In particular, the aborted merger shows Germany's willingness to put its national interests before Europe's despite its leadership role in the region. That was the case even though a successful merger of BAE and EADS would have created a more robust European competitor.
"That government disagreements killed this deal carries a lesson for consolidation of the European defense market as a whole," said Guy Anderson, a senior military industry analyst with IHS Jane's, a consulting and analysis firm.
Merger negotiations had been in the works for months, but as the talks neared Wednesday's deadlines, German negotiators appeared reluctant. "It became clear over the last few days that there was a lack of German support for the deal over all," said one person with knowledge of the British side of the negotiations who requested anonymity. "They appeared to be struggling to see what the advantages of the deal were for Germany."
The German government had sought a stake equal to France's in the combined BAE-EADS. The share for France, which currently owns 15 percent of EADS, would have been reduced to 9 percent under the merger plan. Spain, which holds 5.45 percent, would have a stake of around 3 percent. Germany does not currently have a stake in EADS, but a state-owned bank had planned to buy the EADS shares now held by Daimler. Still, that would have resulted in a smaller stake than France's.
Britain, which owns no shares in BAE but can veto any merger, was initially wary of putting so much of the combined company in the hands of France and Germany, worried that government ownership would handicap the company's ability to secure future military contracts in the United States.
Britain eventually came to accept the idea of direct French and German ownership, said people close to the negotiations, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. But the British sought guarantees from Paris and Berlin that they would not seek to increase their stakes down the road, once Daimler and the French conglomerate Lagardère sold their EADS holdings. France, however, refused to commit to a binding cap on its stake.
Politicians in Berlin worried that plans to locate the civil aviation business with Airbus's headquarters in Toulouse, France, and the military business with BAE's base in Britain, left Germany without an operational sphere of influence. In recent days, the people close to the talks said, Germany's demands focused more intensively on securing long-term job guarantees as well as locating at least a division headquarters - possibly the Eurocopter helicopter business or the Astrium space activities - on its soil.
A spokesman for the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, released a terse statement on Wednesday acknowledging the decision to abandon the merger. "For the German government, the priority is that EADS is able to continue its positive development in all its fields of business," Steffen Seibert, a German government spokesman, said.
Speaking at a news conference in Madrid, President François Hollande of France was unapologetic about his country's desire to maintain its shareholding in a strategic aerospace and military contracting company. The decision to abandon the merger, he said, rested with the companies.
"It's not cause for me to either express regret or to rejoice," he said.
In comments to reporters in London, Ian G. King, the chief executive of BAE, indicated that Germany was the main sticking point. "That would be an accurate representation," he said, according to Reuters.
The chief executive of EADS, Thomas O. Enders, said in a statement, "It is, of course, a pity we didn't succeed, but I'm glad we tried." Mr. Enders, a German, has long pressed for the elimination of government interference in the management of the company.
For BAE and EADS, the spotlight now turns on what each company does next.
"It's unlikely they will have the stomach to go through this again any time soon," Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group in Washington, said on Wednesday.
By joining forces, EADS and BAE Systems had hoped to create a stronger rival to Boeing, the world's biggest military contracting and aerospace company. The activities of the combined company would have been evenly split between the passenger jet market and the military market. The passenger jet market is growing rapidly, but remains volatile. Military contracts provide more steady revenue, but large European countries and the United States have been reining in their military spending.
The failure of the merger attempt could leave BAE, which has sought to expand in the United States, as a takeover target.

HEADLINE: Aerospace Deal Talks Collapse

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Talks between EADS and BAE Systems collapse. | A Wall Street job is "good work if you can get it," New York State's comptroller says. | In a new lawsuit, United States prosecutors are claiming Wells Fargo deceived the federal government about the quality of mortgages. | The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is resisting Wall Street's efforts to temper Dodd-Frank. 

 BODY:
AEROSPACE DEAL TALKS COLLAPSE | Talks between the aerospace giants EADS and BAE Systems have fallen apart. The two companies, which were up against a noon deadline to submit a merger plan, said in a statement on Wednesday that "it has become clear that the interests of the parties' government stakeholders cannot be adequately reconciled with each other or with the objectives that BAE Systems and EADS established for the merger." Officials in Germany, France and Britain had been haggling over the influence that each country would hold over the combined company.
FEWER JOBS, HIGHER PAY | "It's good work if you can get it," the New York State comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, said about Wall Street jobs. Pay in the financial industry rose 4 percent last year, to an average of $362,950 per employee, a level not seen since before the financial crisis, the comptroller said in a new report. That comes even as firms have been shedding jobs. The report estimated that 1,200 positions have been cut this year, with more than 20,000 jobs lost since late 2007. The justification for rich Wall Street pay is the same: banks need "to lure talent from other firms," Susanne Craig and Ben Protess of DealBook write.
U.S. SUES WELLS FARGO | The mortgage mess continues to haunt big banks. In a new lawsuit, United States prosecutors are claiming that Wells Fargo deceived the federal government about the quality of mortgages during the housing boom. Wells Fargo's chief executive, John Stumpf, who got his job in 2007, "wasn't a mere bystander" during the period described in the new lawsuit, David Weidner writes in a column in MarketWatch. At the time, Mr. Stumpf led Wells Fargo's western banking operations.
REGULATOR PUSHES BACK | The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is resisting Wall Street's efforts to temper the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul. The agency is planning to appeal a court ruling that halted the so-called position limits rule, which would curb speculative Wall Street trading, DealBook's Ben Protess reports. Bart Chilton, a Democratic commissioner at the agency, said: "I hope that the agency will appeal in the next few days."
Wall Street's fight continues on other fronts. Goldman Sachs may have found a loophole in the Volcker Rule, The Wall Street Journal reports. Some executives at the firm "believe they have found a way to extricate the credit funds from proposed limits on how much can be invested in hedge funds and private equity funds." Goldman is apparently arguing that "these funds function like banks, just with a different structure."
And criticism of the regulatory overhaul piles up. Harvey R. Miller and Maurice Horwitz, attorneys who worked on the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, argue that Dodd-Frank's "orderly liquidation authority," which is supposed to give the government a way of safely winding down a failing financial firm, is "inadequate and, to some extent, ill-conceived."

Zuckerman, the real estate developer, is on Bloomberg TV at 8 a.m. Phil Angelides, who was the chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, is on Bloomberg TV at 8:30 a.m. In Paris, the French president, François Hollande, meets with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain.
BACK FROM THE DEAD | Apollo Global Management pulled off a "miraculous" feat with the turnaround of the real estate company Realogy, the Deal Professor writes. "The private equity firm had the knowledge and wherewithal to keep working the capital markets and continuously restructure Realogy's debt to ensure its survival. Apollo also stepped up and was willing to risk even more money to support the company."
Now, Apollo will test the public markets. Realogy is expected to price its I.P.O. on Wednesday. Shutterstock, a stock photography company, is also expected to price its offering on Wedneday. Bain Capital is planning an I.P.O. for one of its portfolio companies, Bright Horizons Family Solutions, according to Reuters. The child care and education company, which Bain bought for $1.3 billion in 2008, was praised last year by the first lady, Michelle Obama.

HEADLINE: Aerospace Deal Talks Collapse

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Talks on a merger of EADS and BAE Systems fall apart. | A Wall Street job is "good work if you can get it," New York State's comptroller says. | In a new lawsuit, United States prosecutors are claiming Wells Fargo deceived the federal government about the quality of mortgages. | The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is resisting Wall Street's efforts to temper Dodd-Frank. 

 BODY:
AEROSPACE DEAL TALKS COLLAPSE | Talks between the aerospace giants EADS and BAE Systems have fallen apart. The two companies, which were up against a noon deadline to submit a merger plan, said in a statement on Wednesday that "it has become clear that the interests of the parties' government stakeholders cannot be adequately reconciled with each other or with the objectives that BAE Systems and EADS established for the merger." Officials in Germany, France and Britain had been haggling over the influence that each country would hold over the combined company.

HEADLINE: With Tapes, Authorities Build Criminal Cases Over JPMorgan Loss

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: Taped phone conversations are at the heart of the inquiry into the $6 billion trading loss. 

 BODY:
Federal authorities are using taped phone conversations to build criminal cases related to the multibillion-dollar trading loss at JPMorgan Chase, focusing on calls in which employees openly discussed how to value the troubled bets in a favorable way.
Investigators are looking into the actions of four people who previously worked for the team based in London responsible for the $6 billion loss, according to officials briefed on the case. The Federal Bureau of Investigation could make some arrests in the next several months, said one person who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the inquiry was ongoing.
The phone recordings, which were turned over to authorities by JPMorgan, have helped focus the investigation, the officials said. Authorities are poring over thousands of conversations, in English and French. They are also relying on notes that employees took during staff meetings, instant messages circulated among traders and e-mails sent within the group.
Authorities are examining how some traders in the chief investment office influenced market prices as their bets began to sour. Investigators are also looking into whether records were falsified to hide the problems from executives in New York. Based on those records, JPMorgan submitted inaccurate financial statements to regulators, another area of focus for investigators.
The scope of the inquiry suggests that the problems were isolated to a handful of executives and traders in an overseas division, and did not reflect a fundamental weakness with the bank's culture and leadership. The investigation does not appear to touch the upper echelons of the executive suite, notably Ina Drew who oversaw the chief investment office. The findings could insulate JPMorgan and its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, from further fallout.
Five months into the investigation, attention is centered on four people: Javier Martin-Artajo, a manager who oversaw the trading strategy from the bank's London offices; Bruno Iksil, the trader known as the London Whale for placing the outsize bet; Achilles Macris, the executive in charge of the international chief investment office; and a low-level trader, Julien Grout, who worked for Mr. Iksil and was responsible for marking the trading book.
The people briefed on the matter said the investigation was in the early stages, and federal prosecutors in Manhattan had not made a decision about whether to file charges. None of the current or former employees have been accused of wrongdoing.
If they decide to bring charges, prosecutors will face significant challenges. Financial cases are notoriously difficult to prove in court. The intricacies of Wall Street, which are often central to such matters, can be difficult to explain to jurors. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, authorities have brought few cases against individual employees.
Complicating matters, some of the JPMorgan employees are from France, which does not extradite its citizens. Mr. Iksil has already returned home to France after leaving the bank, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Mr. Grout, also a French citizen, has been suspended from the bank but remains in London, said another person briefed on the situation.
Prosecutors would also have to prove that employees intentionally masked losses by mispricing the positions. It is a high bar. In some derivatives markets, traders are allowed to estimate the value of their positions because actual prices may not be readily available.
Some people close to the investigation say the significance of the mismarked positions may be overstated since they represented a tiny fraction of the overall trades. They also cautioned that authorities could easily take an incriminating sentence from a single phone call out of context, and that many conversations took place in person at the London office.
"Mr. Martin-Artajo is confident that when a complete and fair reconstruction of these complex events is completed, he will be cleared of any wrongdoing," his lawyer, Greg Campbell, said in a statement. "There was no direct or indirect attempt by him at any time to conceal losses."
Lawyers for Mr. Macris and Mr. Grout declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Iksil did not respond to requests for comment. Spokesmen for the United States attorney's office in New York, the F.B.I. in Manhattan and JPMorgan declined to comment.
The trading loss could get further scrutiny on Friday when JPMorgan is set to report third-quarter earnings. Since the blowup was first disclosed in May, the losses have increased to about $6 billion, from $2 billion.
As the bank continues to unwind the bet, investigators have held multiple meetings with lawyers representing people involved in the matter. Authorities plan to interview Mr. Macris this month in his native Greece, according to people briefed on the matter. Such discussions could provide a more detailed account of the employees' actions and alter the course of the investigation. Some of the former employees could also cooperate with authorities.
While authorities are narrowing the focus of the criminal investigations, JPMorgan and its executives still face scrutiny from civil regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is examining whether the bank misled investors about the severity of the losses. British authorities have also recently opened inquiries into the matter, according to the officials.
The trading losses have already prompted a broader management shuffle. Ms. Drew resigned in May. Douglas L. Braunstein, the bank's chief financial officer, is expected to step down from his post later this year, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.
The investigations center on the chief investment office in London.
The group was created to invest JPMorgan's own money and offset potential losses across the bank's disparate businesses. For example, Mr. Iksil bought and sold derivative contracts - financial instruments tied to the value of corporate bonds and other investments - in an effort to protect the bank from market fluctuations.
By early 2012, the London team increased its risk. In response to adverse moves in the markets and regulatory changes, the group made a series of aggressive derivatives trades, betting on the strength of companies like American Airlines.
As these bets started to sour, the London team decided to double down instead of getting out, according to the bank. From late 2011 to March 2012, the bank's net exposure to such contracts more than doubled to nearly $150 billion. Authorities are examining whether the large positions improperly influenced market prices.
The phone calls, which are taped as a part of JPMorgan's routine practices, suggest that traders tried to limit the losses, according to people briefed on the matter. In some phone recordings, Mr. Martin-Artajo encouraged Mr. Iksil to record the value of certain trades in an optimistic fashion, the people said. Their boss, Mr. Macris, was also involved in valuation discussions, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
The chief investment office was also trying to play down the potential risk. Some employees told top JPMorgan executives that the situation was "manageable" and that the position might even produce a slight gain in the second quarter of 2012.
But the estimates proved inaccurate. This summer, JPMorgan restated its first-quarter earnings downward by $459 million, conceding errors in the valuations.
At the time, the bank said that the traders in the chief investment office "generally" valued the holdings within a reasonable range. But JPMorgan also pointed to the potential for deeper problems.
"The restatement is really based upon recent facts that we've uncovered regarding the C.I.O. traders' intent as they were marking the book," Mr. Braunstein, the bank's chief financial officer, said at the time, according to a transcript. "As a result, we questioned the integrity of those trader marks."

HEADLINE: Romney's Confusing Abortion Comment

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: He seemed to distance himself from his "avidly pro-life" primaries stance. Then the campaign came to the rescue. 

 BODY:
Yesterday, Mitt Romney told the editorial board of the Des Moines Register: "There's no legislation with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda."
It sounded like Mr. Romney was trying to distance himself from the anti-abortion position he took during the primaries, when he called himself "an avidly pro-life governor" and said Americans could "count on me, as president, to pursue a policy that protects the life of unborn." It sounded like yet another flip-flop.

Fortunately, the campaign came to the rescue. Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, later told the National Review Online that "Governor Romney would of course support legislation aimed at providing greater protections for life."
In other words, he would make "legislation with regards to abortion" part of his agenda. Perhaps Mr. Romney just meant he did not know of any specific bills that would restrict abortion. But he might want to check in with his running mate, Paul Ryan, who co-sponsored the "No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act," and helped introduced the term "forcible rape" into the national conversation.
Mr. Romney has said repeatedly that, given the opportunity, he would appoint a Supreme Court Justice who would overturn Roe v. Wade, but I guess that would not require legislation. And he has supported state constitutional amendments that would redefine life as starting at the moment of conception, which not only would ban abortions but also some forms of contraception.
Mr. Romney evidently decided yesterday was a good day to throw any semblance of consistency to the wind. In addition to his abortion comment, he said in an interview with CNN that he would protect mortgage and charitable deductions for the middle class.
Perhaps he hasn't been reading his own speeches? Mr. Romney has pledged, repeatedly, to lower taxes for everyone by 20 percent without adding to the deficit. He has said, repeatedly, that he can offset the loss of revenue by closing loopholes and killing deductions.
He's never said what those loopholes and deductions might be, but many economists suggested that he'd have to end the mortgage deduction to achieve anything close to revenue neutrality, and thus hurt the middle class.
I'll make this as clear as possible: Mr. Romney can cut tax rates by 20 percent, preserve mortgage interest and charitable deductions for the middle class, and accept a sharp uptick in the deficit. Or he can cut tax rates by 20 percent, kill deductions for the middle class (which means the middle class will end up paying more in taxes, not less), and accept less of an uptick in the deficit (even then he wouldn't necessarily achieve revenue neutrality). It is not possible to cut tax rates and preserve the mortgage deduction without adding to the deficit. It's not possible.
Jon Stewart said last night that Mr. Romney is as vague as "an HBO season finale." The only difference is that we know exactly where this one picks up, since it's just a rerun of the Reagan and Bush II seasons.

HEADLINE: Aerospace Merger Falls Apart

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT and NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
An effort to create a European behemoth in aerospace and military manufacturing to rival Boeing of the United States has collapsed amid political divisions involving Britain, France and Germany.
In a statement just hours before a Wednesday deadline set by British authorities, BAE Systems of Britain and European Aeronautic Defense and Space, or EADS - the parent of Airbus - said that despite having presented a merger plan based on "sound industrial logic," officials from the three governments could not agree on ownership and industrial structure.
At a time when unity among European governments has been of critical importance as the Continent grapples with its debt crisis, the failure of the deal exposed how competing national considerations can get in the way of cross-border cooperation. 
In particular, the aborted merger shows Germany's willingness to put its national interests before Europe's despite its leadership role in the region. That was the case even though a successful merger of BAE and EADS would have created a more robust European competitor.
"That government disagreements killed this deal carries a lesson for consolidation of the European defense market as a whole," said Guy Anderson, a senior military industry analyst with IHS Jane's, a consulting and analysis firm.
Merger negotiations had been in the works for months, but as the talks neared Wednesday's deadlines, German negotiators appeared reluctant. "It became clear over the last few days that there was a lack of German support for the deal over all," said one person with knowledge of the British side of the negotiations who requested anonymity. "They appeared to be struggling to see what the advantages of the deal were for Germany."
The German government had sought a stake equal to France's in the combined BAE-EADS. The share for France, which currently owns 15 percent of EADS, would have been reduced to 9 percent under the merger plan. Spain, which holds 5.45 percent, would have a stake of around 3 percent. Germany does not currently have a stake in EADS, but a state-owned bank had planned to buy the EADS shares now held by Daimler. Still, that would have resulted in a smaller stake than France's.
Britain, which owns no shares in BAE but can veto any merger, was initially wary of putting so much of the combined company in the hands of France and Germany, worried that government ownership would handicap the company's ability to secure future military contracts in the United States.
Britain eventually came to accept the idea of direct French and German ownership, said people close to the negotiations, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. But the British sought guarantees from Paris and Berlin that they would not seek to increase their stakes down the road, once Daimler and the French conglomerate Lagardère sold their EADS holdings. France, however, refused to commit to a binding cap on its stake.
Politicians in Berlin worried that plans to locate the civil aviation business with Airbus's headquarters in Toulouse, France, and the military business with BAE's base in Britain, left Germany without an operational sphere of influence. In recent days, the people close to the talks said, Germany's demands focused more intensively on securing long-term job guarantees as well as locating at least a division headquarters - possibly the Eurocopter helicopter business or the Astrium space activities - on its soil.
A spokesman for the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, released a terse statement on Wednesday acknowledging the decision to abandon the merger. "For the German government, the priority is that EADS is able to continue its positive development in all its fields of business," Steffen Seibert, a German government spokesman, said.
Speaking at a news conference in Madrid, President François Hollande of France was unapologetic about his country's desire to maintain its shareholding in a strategic aerospace and military contracting company. The decision to abandon the merger, he said, rested with the companies.
"It's not cause for me to either express regret or to rejoice," he said.
In comments to reporters in London, Ian G. King, the chief executive of BAE, indicated that Germany was the main sticking point. "That would be an accurate representation," he said, according to Reuters.
The chief executive of EADS, Thomas O. Enders, said in a statement, "It is, of course, a pity we didn't succeed, but I'm glad we tried." Mr. Enders, a German, has long pressed for the elimination of government interference in the management of the company.
For BAE and EADS, the spotlight now turns on what each company does next.
"It's unlikely they will have the stomach to go through this again any time soon," Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group in Washington, said on Wednesday.
By joining forces, EADS and BAE Systems had hoped to create a stronger rival to Boeing, the world's biggest military contracting and aerospace company. The activities of the combined company would have been evenly split between the passenger jet market and the military market. The passenger jet market is growing rapidly, but remains volatile. Military contracts provide more steady revenue, but large European countries and the United States have been reining in their military spending.
The failure of the merger attempt could leave BAE, which has sought to expand in the United States, as a takeover target.

HEADLINE: National Book Awards Finalists Are Named

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
2:36 p.m. | Updated Junot Díaz, fresh from being awarded a "genius'' grant by the MacArthur Foundation last week, received another honor on Wednesday when he was named a finalist in the fiction category for the National Book Awards.
The foundation also posthumously nominated Anthony Shadid, the New York Times foreign correspondent who died earlier this year while on a reporting assignment in Syria. Mr. Shadid was selected in the nonfiction category for his memoir, "House of Stone: A Memoir of Home, Family, and a Lost Middle East." 
Mr. Díaz, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his first novel, ""The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao," was nominated for "This Is How You Lose Her," a collection of connected short stories.
The National Book Foundation, which presents the awards, appears to have taken to heart the criticism from previous years that its nominations went to obscure works that sold few copies. In addition to Mr. Díaz, two of the five nominees are well-known literary names, and three of the finalists appeared on the cover of The New York Times Book Review this year.
The other nominees for fiction were Dave Eggers for "A Hologram for the King"; Louise Erdrich for "The Round House"; Ben Fountain for "Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk"; and a debut novelist, Kevin Powers, for "The Yellow Birds."
The foundation also showed a preference for fiction that addressed the fault lines of modern American life. "A Hologram for the King" follows a business consultant who tries to fend off foreclosure, raise money to pay his daughter's college tuition and redeem his fortune after being battered by the recession. "Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk" and "The Yellow Birds" both deal with fallout from the Iraq war.
For Mr. Fountain, 54, "Billy Lynn'' was his first novel, or as he emphasized "first published novel -- I've got a few in the drawer.'' The book covers a period of roughly 10 hours as eight Iraq war veterans are honored at a Dallas Cowboys game on Thanksgiving day. In a phone interview, he said the inspiration came from watching the halftime ceremonies of a real Cowboys game one Thanksgiving day during the war.
"It was a surreal mashup of militarism, soft porn, pyrotechnics,'' he said. "Craziest thing I've seen in my life. A celebration of sexuality and militarism in America wrapped up into one big ball. But everyone seemed O.K. with it. There was a small group of soldiers and they were stumbling around laughing. And it stayed in my head, what would that do to you, to have been in the ultimate reality of combat and then get dropped into this very artificial environment.''
In the nonfiction category, the foundation continued the trend of nominating prominent authors, including Robert A. Caro, for "The Passage of Power: The Years of Lyndon Johnson," the fourth installment in Mr. Caro's long-running biography of the president. Katherine Boo, the New Yorker staff writer, was named for "Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death, and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity," her account of three and a half years spent with the residents of Annawadi, an Indian slum. The other nonfiction nominees in addition to Mr. Shadid were Anne Applebaum, the Washington Post columnist, for "Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe, 1945-1956" and Domingo Martinez for "The Boy Kings of Texas."
Nominated in the category for poetry were David Ferry, for "Bewilderment: New Poems and Translations"; Cynthia Huntington, for "Heavenly Bodies"; Tim Seibles, for "Fast Animal"; Alan Shapiro, "Night of the Republic"; and Susan Wheeler, for "Meme."
In the young people's literature category, the finalists were William Alexander for "Goblin Secrets"; Carrie Arcos for "Out of Reach"; Patricia McCormick for "Never Fall Down"; Eliot Schrefer for "Endangered"; and Steve Sheinkin for "Bomb: The Race to Build - and Steal - the World's Most Dangerous Weapon."
A full list of the nominees appears here.
The winners, chosen by panels of authors in each category, will be announced Nov. 14 at a ceremony at Cipriani Wall Street in Lower Manhattan. That night, the foundation will also present its medal for distinguished contribution to American letters to Elmore Leonard, the novelist, and its Literarian Award for outstanding service to the American literary community to Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., chairman and chief executive of The New York Times Company.

HEADLINE: For JPMorgan, A Case Is Built On Taped Calls

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and AZAM AHMED; Peter Eavis and Jessica Silver-Greenberg contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Federal authorities are using taped phone conversations to build criminal cases related to the multibillion-dollar trading loss at JPMorgan Chase, focusing on calls in which employees openly discussed how to value the troubled bets in a favorable way.
Investigators are looking into the actions of four people who previously worked for the team based in London responsible for the $6 billion loss, according to officials briefed on the case. The Federal Bureau of Investigation could make some arrests in the next several months, said one person who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the inquiry was ongoing.
The phone recordings, which were turned over to authorities by JPMorgan, have helped focus the investigation, the officials said. Authorities are poring over thousands of conversations, in English and French. They are also relying on notes that employees took during staff meetings, instant messages circulated among traders and e-mails sent within the group.
Authorities are examining how some traders in the chief investment office influenced market prices as their bets began to sour. Investigators are also looking into whether records were falsified to hide the problems from executives in New York. Based on those records, JPMorgan submitted inaccurate financial statements to regulators, another area of focus for investigators. 
The scope of the inquiry suggests that the problems were isolated to a handful of executives and traders in an overseas division, and did not reflect a fundamental weakness with the bank's culture and leadership. The investigation does not appear to touch the upper echelons of the executive suite, notably Ina Drew who oversaw the chief investment office. The findings could insulate JPMorgan and its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, from further fallout.
Five months into the investigation, attention is centered on four people: Javier Martin-Artajo, a manager who oversaw the trading strategy from the bank's London offices; Bruno Iksil, the trader known as the London Whale for placing the outsize bet; Achilles Macris, the executive in charge of the international chief investment office; and a low-level trader, Julien Grout, who worked for Mr. Iksil and was responsible for marking the trading book.
The people briefed on the matter said the investigation was in the early stages, and federal prosecutors in Manhattan had not made a decision about whether to file charges. None of the current or former employees have been accused of wrongdoing.
If they decide to bring charges, prosecutors will face significant challenges. Financial cases are notoriously difficult to prove in court. The intricacies of Wall Street, which are often central to such matters, can be difficult to explain to jurors. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, authorities have brought few cases against individual employees.
Complicating matters, some of the JPMorgan employees are from France, which does not extradite its citizens. Mr. Iksil has already returned home to France after leaving the bank, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Mr. Grout, also a French citizen, has been suspended from the bank but remains in London, said another person briefed on the situation.
Prosecutors would also have to prove that employees intentionally masked losses by mispricing the positions. It is a high bar. In some derivatives markets, traders are allowed to estimate the value of their positions because actual prices may not be readily available.
Some people close to the investigation say the significance of the mismarked positions may be overstated since they represented a tiny fraction of the overall trades. They also cautioned that authorities could easily take an incriminating sentence from a single phone call out of context, and that many conversations took place in person at the London office.
"Mr. Martin-Artajo is confident that when a complete and fair reconstruction of these complex events is completed, he will be cleared of any wrongdoing," his lawyer, Greg Campbell, said in a statement. "There was no direct or indirect attempt by him at any time to conceal losses."
Lawyers for Mr. Macris and Mr. Grout declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Iksil did not respond to requests for comment. Spokesmen for the United States attorney's office in New York, the F.B.I. in Manhattan and JPMorgan declined to comment.
The trading loss could get further scrutiny on Friday when JPMorgan is set to report third-quarter earnings. Since the blowup was first disclosed in May, the losses have increased to about $6 billion, from $2 billion.
As the bank continues to unwind the bet, investigators have held multiple meetings with lawyers representing people involved in the matter. Authorities plan to interview Mr. Macris this month in his native Greece, according to people briefed on the matter. Such discussions could provide a more detailed account of the employees' actions and alter the course of the investigation. Some of the former employees could also cooperate with authorities.
While authorities are narrowing the focus of the criminal investigations, JPMorgan and its executives still face scrutiny from civil regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is examining whether the bank misled investors about the severity of the losses. British authorities have also recently opened inquiries into the matter, according to the officials.
The trading losses have already prompted a broader management shuffle. Ms. Drew resigned in May. Douglas L. Braunstein, the bank's chief financial officer, is expected to step down from his post later this year, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.
The investigations center on the chief investment office in London.
The group was created to invest JPMorgan's own money and offset potential losses across the bank's disparate businesses. For example, Mr. Iksil bought and sold derivative contracts - financial instruments tied to the value of corporate bonds and other investments - in an effort to protect the bank from market fluctuations.
By early 2012, the London team increased its risk. In response to adverse moves in the markets and regulatory changes, the group made a series of aggressive derivatives trades, betting on the strength of companies like American Airlines.
As these bets started to sour, the London team decided to double down instead of getting out, according to the bank. From late 2011 to March 2012, the bank's net exposure to such contracts more than doubled to nearly $150 billion. Authorities are examining whether the large positions improperly influenced market prices.
The phone calls, which are taped as a part of JPMorgan's routine practices, suggest that traders tried to limit the losses, according to people briefed on the matter. In some phone recordings, Mr. Martin-Artajo encouraged Mr. Iksil to record the value of certain trades in an optimistic fashion, the people said. Their boss, Mr. Macris, was also involved in valuation discussions, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
The chief investment office was also trying to play down the potential risk. Some employees told top JPMorgan executives that the situation was "manageable" and that the position might even produce a slight gain in the second quarter of 2012.
But the estimates proved inaccurate. This summer, JPMorgan restated its first-quarter earnings downward by $459 million, conceding errors in the valuations.
At the time, the bank said that the traders in the chief investment office "generally" valued the holdings within a reasonable range. But JPMorgan also pointed to the potential for deeper problems.
"The restatement is really based upon recent facts that we've uncovered regarding the C.I.O. traders' intent as they were marking the book," Mr. Braunstein, the bank's chief financial officer, said at the time, according to a transcript. "As a result, we questioned the integrity of those trader marks."

HEADLINE: Clean Your Hands and the Pacific

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
Method's ecologically friendly home-cleaning products are recognizable on grocery store shelves as the colorful liquids in clear plastic bottles. 
But this week Method is introducing a dish and hand soap packaged in an opaque plastic bottle the color of dirty ocean water. The bottles are made from plastic debris that washed up on Hawaiian beaches and recovered by Method employees and volunteers.
The company, started in San Francisco in 2001 by Adam Lowry and Eric Ryan, already makes its packaging from recycled plastics sourced from curbside recycling programs. But Mr. Lowry said the new bottle is meant to draw attention to the growing problem of plastic pollution in the ocean and its harmful effects on marine wildlife.
Method sent crews to Hawaii because detritus from the so-called Great Pacific garbage patch, a giant swirling pile of floating trash, is constantly washed onto some of its beaches.
Mr. Lowry, who has the title of the company's chief greens keeper, said that the process was not cost effective, but that economy was hardly the point.
''We want to create a conversation about recycling plastics,'' he said. ''The real objective is to make the point that we ought to work with the plastics already on the planet.''
The limited editions of 2-in-1 dish and hand soap in the Method Ocean Plastic bottles will be available at Whole Foods Market for $4.99. Information: methodhome.com.

HEADLINE: U.S. Economy Gets a Lift From the Housing Markets

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Improvement in the housing markets helped bolster economic growth at the end of the summer in most regions of the country, according to a Federal Reserve survey released Wednesday. 
The Fed said growth improved in 10 of its 12 regional banking districts from mid-August through September, while leveling off in one region and slowing in another. Rising home sales helped lift home prices in most districts.
The report, known informally as the beige book, also cited an increase in auto sales in most parts of the country. Still, consumer spending was flat or up only slightly in most districts. Manufacturing activity was mixed, with half of the districts reporting slight improvement since the previous Fed report. And hiring was unchanged in most districts.
The beige book provides anecdotal information on business conditions around the country. The information collected by the 12 regional banks will be used as the basis for the central bank's policy discussion at its meeting on Oct. 23-24.
Economists expect no major moves at the meeting because the Fed adopted aggressive new policies to spur the economy in September.
The Fed is buying mortgage bonds to lower longer-term rates, which could spur more borrowing and spending. And it plans to keep short-term interest rates near zero until at least mid-2015, even after the recovery shows signs of strengthening.
By making borrowing cheaper, the Fed hopes to help the modest housing recovery. When home prices rise, people tend to feel wealthier and spend more freely. Consumer spending drives nearly 70 percent of economic activity.
The central bank's report noted that oil production hit a record high in South Dakota, while the Minneapolis, Kansas City., Mo., and Dallas districts also had robust gains in energy production. The Atlanta and Richmond, Va., districts reported record levels for port activity in their regions.
The drought continued to weigh on farm activity in the Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas districts. Dallas and Chicago said that recent rains had improved the outlook there.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that wholesalers increased their stockpiles by 0.5 percent in August after a 0.6 percent increase in July.
It also said sales at the wholesale level jumped 0.9 percent in August, ending three months of declines. The increase was the biggest one-month gain since February.
Total wholesale inventories stood at $487.5 billion. That's 26.9 percent higher than the postrecession low in September 2009.
It would take about five weeks to exhaust the level of stockpiles at the August sales pace. Companies typically increase their stockpiles when they anticipate sales will rise in coming months.

HEADLINE: Promoting Entrepreneurship in the Gulf Region

BYLINE: By VINITA BHARADWAJ

 BODY:
DUBAI -- On a recent Thursday evening, ahead of the Islamic weekend, the newest cafe-office space in Dubai, Make business hub, was busy and buzzy. About 60 guests from the United Arab Emirates and nearby countries were being courted by seven international start-ups, who were presenting their business plans in the hope of attracting angel investors and venture capital funding.
The start-ups had been discovered by SeedStartup, a venture capital fund and start-up accelerator program based in Dubai. ''We invest between $20,000 and $25,000 in businesses we believe have potential and take a 10 percent equity,'' said Rony el-Nashar, the founder of SeedStartup. ''It's a higher risk we're taking, because we're investing in essentially nothing.'' 
Entrepreneurs who enter the program are required to spend three months in Dubai, where they are mentored by SeedStartup and given an opportunity to pitch their ideas to investors.
In recent years, entrepreneurship has become a buzzword in the Arab world, operating on the credo that business is an essential engine for social, economic and eventually political progress in the region. The region is also under pressure to generate jobs to employ one of the largest youth populations in the world: half of its people are under 25 and 26.4 percent are unemployed, according to the International Labor Organization. The I.L.O. predicts that youth unemployment rates in the region will rise to 28.4 percent in 2017.
A 2011 report by the Arab youth employment initiative Silatech and the Gallup polling institute showed that the greatest problems for young Arabs in high-income countries like the U.A.E., Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, were related to entrepreneurship issues. Their concerns suggest that potential new business creators in these countries view government regulations as an obstacle to their ambitions.
''Entrepreneurship must remain in the forefront of discussion for it to be continuously discussed at a policy-making level. I agree that if an individual left from a certain city in the Middle East to the United States he could realize his dream faster,'' said Ahmad Bin Byat, the chairman of du, one of two U.A.E. telecommunications operators.
''The youth of today do not have the same mind-set as the youth of the pre-oil era,'' said Mr. Bin Byat. ''The appetite for risk has greatly reduced, and most of the current youth are happy with jobs. I hope that attitude changes and we see more enterprise and innovation from the youth of today.''
To encourage the spirit of entrepreneurship, du has launched a television show on the local channel Dubai One.
''The Entrepreneur,'' which opened on Oct. 3, started with about 100 contestants, including 33 women. A jury of local business personalities whittled down the contenders in the first two weekly episodes to produce a short list of 10 finalists, including two women.
Over the next two months, the finalists will be eliminated one by one to produce a winner, who will earn a 1 million dirham, or $272,000, prize to jump-start his, or her, business plan.
An oft-heard lament within the region's entrepreneur ecosystem is the Arab world's failure to produce a Steven P. Jobs or an Infosys, the Indian outsourcing services giant. Companies are either large institutions dependent on state support or smaller enterprises with limited access to capital and talent.
''Why is the region lacking innovation? Let's take the U.A.E., which is a consumer-oriented society. It has basic services -- although very well managed -- but if someone wanted to innovate and invent, is this local market ready to accept it? Start-ups tend to look locally, but they must be more ambitious, aim regionally and even globally, because the local market is just not big enough,'' said Evangelos Lianos, an executive vice-president at Etisalat, the older of the two Emirates telecom operators.
In theory, setting up a business in the U.A.E. is fairly easy, especially within any one of the numerous free zones that eliminate the legal requirement for a majority-stake local business partner and thus permit full ownership; a start-up launched out of a garage or basement, however, is not the sort of legend one is likely to hear of.
''License fees and linking business set-up to real estate space are definitely challenges for start-ups in the region,'' Mr. El-Nashar of SeedStartup said. ''Virtual office options are available, and although they are cheaper than settling for a physical office, still come attached with basic fees that are more expensive than in the West,'' he added. ''Entrepreneurs, especially technology start-ups, are looking to minimize risks and find a formula that works. That's the kind of business climate the region needs to encourage.''
Nicholas Holmes, a former management consultant at Accenture, founded MediaGraph, one of the seven projects selected by Mr. Nashar for Seed-Startup. Mr. Holmes described his company as ''an online public relations service designed to facilitate high-quality contact between small and medium businesses and members of the media.''
''Dubai is similar to London in many senses. It has high rents, high living costs, high labor costs for skilled workers -- all those things can kill a start-up,'' he said.
''What's lacking compared to London, of course, is a developed entrepreneurial ecosystem. But nobody can doubt that huge efforts are being made to change that, with new accelerators popping up, workspaces such as Make and much more attention being paid to entrepreneurialism in general thanks to those famous success stories -- the Dubizzles and Cobones of the world,'' Mr. Holmes said. Dubizzle, an online classified advertising business and Cobones, a group-buying Web site, are both based in Dubai.
Culturally, emphasis is placed on safer education and career choices and discouraging risk-taking. ''The policies in place are probably a reflection of the cultural stigma associated with the fear of failure. A change in policies would doubtless help change cultural taboos,'' said Mr. Lianos. Bankruptcy is considered a criminal offence in several countries; a bounced check in the Emirates can land a person in prison.
''I hope 'The Entrepreneur' will be a catalyst of change,'' said Mr. Bin Byat. ''It is a completely U.A.E.-developed, produced and supported show, and I think will raise some important issues that could result in positive developments.''

HEADLINE: Audio Tour Is a Work of Art at Frieze

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL

 BODY:
When asked to respond to the artist Bertrand Dezoteux's new video work, ''The History of France in 3D,'' the American financial analyst Max Keiser, who presents RT network's ''Keiser Report,'' did not hesitate to speculate.
''Well, this is clearly the future,'' he says on the audio guide that is being provided to visitors at the Frieze Art Fair in London, which runs through Sunday. ''France creates a space program, and while they are exploring space there's a thermonuclear war on planet Earth and everything is destroyed so the only representatives in the universe are these French people in the spacecraft. This is how they recreate the universe -- in the image of a French person.''
Whether or not Mr. Keiser's interpretation coincides with the artist's intention is sort of beside the point. For Cécile B. Evans, 29, the creator of the audio guide, it is the fact that Mr. Keiser is creating his own personal narrative that she finds really exciting. 
Ms. Evans, who was born in the United States to Belgian parents and raised in Florida, was selected as the winner of the 2012 Emdash Award, the Frieze's annual prize for emerging artists, to present a site-specific installation for this year's Frieze fair. Her winning proposal was an alternative audio tour that does the opposite of what audio tours typically do. That is, it does not provide names, dates and other contextualizing historical information. Instead, it offers voices of people from outside the art world, responding to works of art in an entirely personal way.
''My main interest is in putting emotional value into the fair,'' Ms. Evans said. ''Art fairs are usually weighted with economic or theoretical value. With this audio tour, what I'm doing is basically taking subjective or not really relevant information and pumping it in as though it's objective or as though it's factual.''
The purpose of the project, she explains, is to encourage viewers to respond to art in whatever way feels most genuine, without mediating their responses based on preconceived or learned ideas about art.
''Sometimes people are afraid to talk about art in their own voice or in their own way,'' Ms. Evans said . ''This is allowing people to say, 'to me, that looks like ... or 'this reminds me of ... , and not to be afraid to be wrong or right.''
That populist emphasis was precisely what appealed to the Emdash judges, who selected the project from among 750 proposals this year, said the Frieze's project curator, Sarah McCrory.
''We have a situation that's fairly unique for an art fair, in that we have a huge general public that attends,'' Ms. McCrory said. ''That's different from other art fairs, which mainly cater to people in the art business. The art world can sometimes be full of jargon or otherwise indecipherable, and this kind of project makes it much more accessible. We thought this was a generous project.'' As winner of the Emdash award, Ms. Evans received production costs of up to £10,000, or about $16,000, to create the piece specifically for Frieze, as well as an artist's fee of £1,000.
The 10-year-old art fair, expected to attract about 65,000 visitors this year, is devoted to selling the work of living contemporary artists. Its importance has resonated beyond the boundaries of its physical home in Regent's Park to become something of a Londonwide event, known popularly as Frieze Week. Its impact is felt at museums and galleries, but also within in the worlds of design and fashion.
The voices on Ms. Evans's audio guide are all recognizable figures from other spheres of culture. That is another reason, Ms. McCrory said, the project was particularly appealing. Along with Mr. Keiser, participants in Ms. Evans's project include Rabbi Lionel Blue, the first openly gay British rabbi, the American television producer Caryn Mandabach (behind hits like ''The Cosby Show,'' ''Roseanne'' and ''Third Rock from the Sun''), the author and television cook Sophie Dahl, the astronomer Patrick Moore (''The Sky at Night''), the ''cat biologist'' Roger Tabor and the geneticist Hugh Montgomery. The author and historian Simon Schama is the ''host'' on the tour, with his voice and his likeness to appear as a hologram in three locations at the fair.
The free tour lasts about 30 minutes and includes about a dozen works of art, selected from the displays of the 175 galleries participating this year. Unlike a museum audio tour, it will not dictate how listeners move through the fair. Ms. Evans said she would rather people make a haphazard trip, locating the galleries' booths on a map and looking inside for selected artworks that will be tagged as being part of the tour.
''The main qualification for me was that the artworks had to be work I respect, and that they'd be things I'd selfishly want to have explained to me,'' she said. The desire to ask for commentary from experts in other fields was inspired, she said, by the panel format on British television shows like ''The Big Fat Quiz of the Year'' or ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks,'' in which questions are raised but, ''the goal isn't necessarily to find an answer, it's more just to come to an interesting conversation.''
Ms. Evans did not attend art school, she says with a tinge of pride. She studied theater and has worked as an actress since she was 5 years old, and then attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts before moving to Paris. It was only about four years ago that she moved from performing to doing what might be termed performance art pieces, like ''Straight Up, 2011,'' an interpretive sign language performance of Paula Abdul's 1988 hit single of the same name.
Ms. Evans says it is not the subject matter but just the format of her work that has changed since she left acting. ''I've always been so interested in emotions and how they get produced,'' she said. ''So, in the film industry how they produce tears, and in medicine how scientists study the chemical in the brain that produces the sensation of love. Why do we need to know this? When I made the move from acting into art, that's what I took with me.''
Even though she now feels comfortable calling herself an artist, she says she still feels a certain remove from the culture surrounding art, because it is often resistant to the expression of feelings.
''In the art world, we're starving for a new sincerity or a new sentimentality that just hasn't been there for a long time,'' she said. ''If you look back at the Renaissance or the Enlightenment, it was very common for people to value their emotional response to painting or other forms of art. I think people want to get back to that. To me, sentimentality is just the ability to look at or respond to something and to be transported somewhere else.''

HEADLINE: Women Entrepreneurs Drive Growth in Africa

BYLINE: By JOSH KRON

 BODY:
KAMPALA, UGANDA -- Far too often, in the view of Africa's budding female entrepreneurs, their continent is characterized as the recipient of aid that enables residents just to struggle by, and as a place that mistreats and marginalizes its women.
Late in 2010, after a visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo, the United Nations' special rapporteur on sexual violence called that country the ''rape capital of the world.'' Last month, a South African politician named her own country the ''rape capital of the world.''
Data analysis from Google shows that since 2004, the most common single term related to searches from the United States for ''Africa'' has been ''AIDS.'' This year, the charity Save the Children named Niger the ''worst place to be a mother.'' On the United Nations' Web site, Africa is the only continent listed under ''Issues.''
It was into this world, and against it, says Bethlehem Tilahun, that her shoe company SoleRebels was born. 
''I kept hearing over and over the phrase 'poverty alleviation,''' said Ms. Tilahun, now a footwear mogul whose company grossed $2 million in sales this past year. ''The media, preoccupied with a singular narrative about 'Africa' that missed the story of Africa -- part of a larger spectrum of endless entities that have monopolized Africa's image, our brand.''
With SoleRebels, she said proudly, ''We've inverted the whole paradigm.''
Ms. Tilahun, 33, is one of a cresting wave of African entrepreneurs who are harnessing Africa's businesses and brands as the continent enjoys its greatest economic success in generations. The International Monetary Fund now forecasts, admittedly in a recession-plagued world, that Africa will have the fastest-growing economy of any continent over the next five years.
Many of the new entrepreneurs of Africa are women.
Ms. Tilahun became one with shoes.
Beginning in 2004 as a recent college graduate in Ethiopia with a handful of artisans from the neighborhood and a workshop on her grandmother's plot, Ms. Tilahun has built SoleRebels (pun-intended) from a handmade sandal shop into a multimillion-dollar enterprise, whose iconic footwear -- still handmade and eco-friendly -- sells abroad for $60 and up.
Now her company employs roughly 100 workers, and it recently opened its flagship store in central Addis Ababa, where SoleRebels' Ethiopian-branded fusion of Abyssinian and Western taste is on display. With each pair of shoes, she said, she seeks to change people's minds about Africa.
''We've flipped the concept of non-Africans writing the script,'' Ms. Tilahun went on. ''We've basically taken back control of our destiny by controlling the marketing message.''
Indeed, Africa may not be as badly off as indexes sometimes imply.
According to a World Bank report released this month, more than 20 sub-Saharan African countries, totaling more than 400 million people, have gained middle-income status.
This year, the World Bank said, one-third of the economies of the 49 sub-Saharan African countries will grow at a clip of 6 percent or more; meanwhile, the number of people living in poverty has fallen roughly 10 percentage points over the past decade.
It has as much, or more, to do with trade as aid. And it is compounding a surge of female entrepreneurs.
''Women in the private sector represent a powerful source of economic growth and opportunity,'' said Marcelo Giugale, the World Bank's director for poverty reduction and economic management for Africa.
''In Africa, you see women working a lot,'' noted Markus Goldstein, a development economist in the gender department of the World Bank in Washington. ''They are very active in the labor market.'' According to World Bank data, nearly two-thirds of women are participating in Africa's labor force.
Women doing business in ways that support families include the myriad cross-border traders found throughout sub-Saharan Africa; women selling used clothes and tin kitchenware; hair stylists; and owners of fashion salons, small food stores and even watering holes (catering almost exclusively to men).
Those are all businesses that are seen as more traditional. In 21st-century Africa, businesswomen are pushing into the national scenes of their countries as movers and shakers of industry.
In South Africa, Sibongile Sambo has been a pioneer for women in aviation. She leads an exclusive charter-aircraft company. In Kenya, Ory Okello, 23, helped found Ushahidi , a Web 2.0 crowdsourcing software initiative that changed the game in real-time tracking of emergency events via cyberspace. It was originally geared toward political violence after Kenya's bloody presidential election in 2008, and now is used by Google.
In Nigeria, Adenike Ogunlesi has built a regional children's clothing empire from scratch -- she started by selling pajamas out of the trunk of her car.
In lakeside Uganda, Lovin Kobusingya has brought fish sausages to the dining table.
''I always knew I was a businesswoman,'' said Ms. Kobusingye, 29, a mother of two. ''When I was in high school, I used to sell illegal sweets. And I made money. I made a lot of money.''
Her company, Kati Fish Farms, sells 500 kilograms, or about 1,100 pounds, of fish sausage a day, and moves 8 tons of fish a week.
''I am very happy and proud'' at being a female entrepreneur, she said. ''When I was young, they said: 'A woman is a woman -- a man should take care of you.'''
''But women are actually contributing a lot more than men. We always find ourselves multitasking,'' she said, between working and raising a family. ''If it could be equated in terms of currency, it would be 80 percent of the economy.''
The rate of female entrepreneurship is higher in Africa than in any other region of the world, the World Bank says. And even African countries criticized for abuses of human rights and civil liberties are progressive on gender.
It may not be a coincidence that a number of Africa's economies doing the best without many resources -- like Ethiopia or Rwanda -- have austere, orderly, patriotic, aid-efficient governments that simultaneously spurn charity aid and focus on foreign-direct investment and private enterprise.
In Rwanda, a change in land-title laws to allow wives to be registered alongside their husbands led to a nearly 20 percent increase in female-registered farms.
Both Ethiopia and Rwanda have been criticized for restrictions on civil liberties yet have also given birth to targeted marketing of U.S. consumers -- including Rwanda's Bourbon coffee chain and Ms. Tilahun's SoleRebels -- efforts that may help alter Africa's image.
''As I entered college,'' Ms. Tilahun noted, ''it had become clear to me that 'poverty alleviation' is a myth.''
''People don't want to be 'not poor,' they want some form of prosperity. That doesn't mean millionaires or billionaires, but prosperous,'' Ms. Tilahun said. ''And to create prosperity you have to create something world class.''
She started with the basics -- fibers. These have been part of survival and ingenuity in Ethiopia -- along with China, India and Egypt, one of the world's most ancient civilizations. ''Footwear was an excellent platform,'' she said. SoleRebels footwear -- including shoes, sandals and slippers -- is made from a variety of hand-woven, locally made materials, including recycled car tires and traditionally grown koba fiber.
Over the years, her company used new thread types and weave designs, revamping customer service to incorporate Ethiopia's culture of hospitality. As a woman growing up and working in Ethiopia, she said, there were people who tried to limit her because of her gender, ''but I never felt any limitations.''
Moreover, she felt that she was doing something genuine -- ''people want their brands to be real,'' she said.
As her shoes have caught on, so has an image of Africa that consumers are willing to buy, and not simply fund.
SoleRebels has become one of Africa's best-known shoe companies, its products advertised in hip magazines from Toronto to Berlin. Consumers and investors from donor-aid nations have responded. Ms. Tilahun was named by Forbes magazine as one of 100 women to watch in 2012 and invited to speak at the 2011 World Economic Forum.
There is an ''urgent need,'' she said, to create more African-owned brands delivering world-class products to the global market, to drown out charitable organizations ''selling their variety of messages about and images of Africa.''
''Let's face it,'' she said, ''it's pretty hard to convince someone to buy what you are selling when someone else has convinced them you are solely occupied with swatting away flies from your face.''

HEADLINE: Indexes Suffer on Results From Alcoa and Chevron

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Disappointing results and forecasts from Alcoa and Chevron at the start of the corporate earnings season on Tuesday pulled stock indexes lower for a third consecutive day Wednesday.
The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 128 points, its steepest loss since late June. 
Alcoa, the aluminum producer, beat Wall Street's earnings estimates on Tuesday night, but said it expected a slowdown in China to weaken demand for aluminum. Its shares fell 42 cents, or 4.60 percent, to $8.71.
The company is often used as a weather vane for the global economy. ''And judging by Alcoa's massive inventory of aluminum, it seems pretty anemic,'' said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.
Chevron, one of the country's largest oil companies, warned late Tuesday that slumping oil prices and production would cause earnings to be ''substantially lower.'' It blamed Hurricane Isaac for disrupting production at a Mississippi refinery.
On Tuesday, the Supreme Court also refused to block a $19 billion judgment levied against Chevron by an Ecuadorean court over polluting the Amazon. Shares of Chevron sank $4.91, or 4.18 percent, to $112.45.
The Dow fell 128.56 points, or 0.95 percent, to 13,344.97, its fourth straight drop and the largest point decline since June 25.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.92 points, or 0.62 percent, to 1,432.56. The Nasdaq lost 13.24 points, to 3,051.78.
Of the 10 industry groups within the S.& P. 500, all but financials fell. Energy and materials stocks, whose fortunes hinge on economic growth, slumped the most.
In one of the few economic reports out Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said the nation's economy ''expanded modestly'' from mid-August through September. The survey, known as the beige book, pointed to improvements in car sales, manufacturing and the housing market. Employment and consumer spending, however, remained mostly flat.
Wal-Mart Stores' shares surged $1.28 to $75.42. The president of its United States division told Wall Street analysts that the company planned to open more small-scale stores to compete with discount retailers and drugstore chains.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 9/32, to 99 16/32, and the yield fell to 1.68 percent from 1.71 percent late Tuesday.

NEWARK -- The man in the tan shirt led the way to a squarish room in his house and sat down at a round table. Quietly, matter-of-factly, he talked about what happened in the summer of 1967.
''Rebellion, I call it,'' said the man, the poet Amiri Baraka, as he recalled the riots in Newark, which lasted nearly a week and left 26 people dead and more than 1,000 injured, among them Mr. Baraka himself. 
Four and a half decades have passed, enough time for historians and urban policy experts to write millions of words about Newark's industrial decline after World War II and the riots that became a symbol of urban unrest and that continue to cast a shadow over the city.
Mr. Baraka, who became a celebrity in the decades after the riots, is one of the featured names at a four-day poetry festival in Newark starting on Thursday that organizers claim is the largest such festival in North America. The discussion in his house the other day offered a preview, and an almost moment-by-moment look back at the bloody upheaval. In the end, 889 stores had been damaged or looted, officials said.
By the time the violence broke out in Newark, there had been race riots in Jersey City, Harlem and the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles. And Mr. Baraka, a writer once known as LeRoi Jones who had been a playwright in Greenwich Village and a black nationalist in Harlem, had returned to his native Newark. ''The idea that the city would blow up was obvious,'' he said.
It began after the police stopped a black cabdriver for a traffic violation and took him to a police station, where the arresting officers beat him. Mr. Baraka said he had joined a crowd outside the police station during the day but had walked home as night fell. Rumors were rampant that the taxi driver had died in police custody; in fact, he had been taken to a hospital.
Before long, Mr. Baraka said, word spread that bricks and bottles were being thrown at the police station and that crowds were breaking windows in the neighborhood. ''I had this brand-new Volkswagen bus,'' he said, and he and several friends piled in. ''We drove up Springfield Avenue. By the time we got to Belmont, it was raging.''
''Pretty soon, pop, pop, pop, pop,'' he said. ''Shots.''
He said that the police stopped the van. One of the officers was ''a cop I had gone to high school with -- Italian.''
''He hit me on the top of my head with his gun,'' he said, ''and then they started beating.'' He said people watching from an apartment building took aim at the officers and threw things -- including, he said, a refrigerator.
''The police took me to Dominick Spina's office,'' he said, referring to the Newark police director at the time. ''I fell on the floor. Spina says, 'We got you,' like some grade-B movie. I say, 'Yes, but I'm not dead yet.' That's the level things were at.''
He was arrested on charges of carrying an illegal weapon and resisting arrest, and even before the trial began, he castigated the judge who was presiding and the all-white panel of potential jurors as ''my oppressors.'' He was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison, but in 1969 a judge reversed the conviction for lack of evidence.
Mr. Baraka has been a regular at the poetry festival, which has been held every other year since 1986 and is formally called the Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival. Mr. Baraka is scheduled to read poems at the festival; he is also scheduled to appear on Saturday with Clement A. Price, a history professor at Rutgers University, in a discussion of the effect of the riots and other 1960s turbulence on Mr. Baraka's work.
It was an appearance at the Dodge festival in 2002 that cost Mr. Baraka his position as New Jersey's poet laureate. He read from his post-Sept. 11 poem ''Someone Blew Up America,'' in which he suggested that Israel had known about the Sept. 11 attacks in advance and that it had warned 4,000 Israeli citizens not to go to work at the World Trade Center that day. Within days, Gov. James E. McGreevey demanded that he resign as poet laureate. He refused, but the State Legislature eventually abolished the position.
''Poetry is underrated,'' he said, ''so when they got rid of the poet laureate thing, I wrote a letter saying, 'This is progress. In the old days, they could lock me up. Now they just take away my title.' ''
But the conversation soon returned to Newark, then and now.
''Newark, pre-1967, is a different place,'' he said. ''That 1967 thing was like a reckoning. I used to get held by the police for going to a poetry reading. The police would take the script out of my hand. That's like living under some kind of fascism.''
''This is another era,'' he said. ''My son is a councilman in the South Ward. In a sense that's what we always wanted, that he'd go away to school and not disappear into the suburbs with some degree. His brother is his chief of staff. His other brother is his chief of security.''

HEADLINE: At State Parks, $143 Million Infusion Goes Toward Tackling Overdue Repairs

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
HARRIMAN STATE PARK, N.Y. -- Along the roads past lakes and campgrounds here, workers have been busy laying down fresh asphalt. Near Lake Cohasset, aging sewer lines are being replaced. Soon, dozens of frayed cabins that house disadvantaged children in the summer will receive makeovers, including new roofs.
The construction in Harriman is part of a push to address the backlog of deferred maintenance and infrastructure projects across New York's state parks, which last spring received an infusion of $89 million from the governor and the Legislature for capital improvements. Adding private grants and federal funds, the total investment will be $143 million -- the largest single allocation of capital money in the history of the park system. 
''It's important, welcome and transformative,'' said Rose Harvey, commissioner of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. ''The parks have been underfunded for decades. We're going to do a lot before you can see it and feel it. But it will vastly improve the quality of the experience for the visitor.''
Welcome as the money is, it is a fraction of what state officials say is needed: They have identified more than $1 billion of required rehabilitation across the state's 213 parks and historic sites, which drew 58 million visitors last year.
But the capital construction now under way was embraced by park advocates, who had long pleaded for such financing. And it should correct some of the most pressing health and safety problems plaguing the park system.
Last month, the state comptroller's office issued an audit assessing conditions in state parks. At some of the 33 parks visited, inspectors found sections in such disrepair that workers had cordoned them off to ensure public safety.
In several cases, the security barriers themselves were showing signs of decay. The audit cited John Boyd Thacher State Park near Albany, where a decrepit swimming pool, closed in 2007, is surrounded by a chain-link fence that is beginning to fall apart, with evident gaps. The report called on the state to find more permanent solutions, ''where potentially hazardous infrastructure issues are likely to remain unaddressed for a significant length of time.''
In an illustration of the breadth of the construction backlog, the $416,000 allotted to Thacher State Park is not enough to reopen the pool. Rather, it will go toward things like bathroom repairs, playground equipment and parking-lot resurfacing.
Many of the problems stem from the practice of deferring maintenance year after year, which over time turns minor repairs into major renovations. The state audit reported that budget cuts had ''significantly impacted operations,'' with the agency's operating budget of $183 million in the 2011-12 fiscal year representing a 5 percent decrease from the previous year.
Laura DiBetta, parks program director at Parks and Trails New York, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the commitment from Albany came as something of a surprise, especially given the economic climate. Two years ago, scores of state parks and historic sites were threatened with being closed after Gov. David A. Paterson proposed a $20 million cut to state parks under the 2010 budget. State lawmakers restored some money, giving the parks a reprieve.
''When Governor Paterson tried to close state parks, that changed the discourse a bit,'' said Ms. DiBetta, whose group, with the Alliance for New York State Parks, released a report in 2010, ''Protect Their Future: New York's State Parks in Crisis.''
''People were outraged,'' Ms. DiBetta said. As a result, she said, groups supporting specific parks were formed and others were reinvigorated.
At Harriman State Park, which encompasses 47,000 acres in Orange and Rockland Counties, the injection of capital is already apparent.
More than 12 miles of roads were repaved in the past three months. One morning last month, Skip Ford, a retired Air Force pilot who rents a cabin on Little Long Pond during the summer, surveyed the road through his campground, which had been paved that morning. ''I didn't think they'd ever do it,'' he said, seeming somewhat stunned. ''It was a dirt road that kept washing out. It looks great.''
But others, like Arden Valley Road, did not make the cut because they are closed in winter and therefore not as widely used. ''It's five miles, and you don't want to drive on it,'' said Larry Soeller, a senior park engineer for the Palisades region. ''This funding will go a long way, but there's a lot more to be done -- more roofs, more sewer work, more paving, a lot of general building improvements.''
Mr. Soeller estimated that about one-third of the several hundred structures in the park needed repairs, but that the new financing would probably touch only about 5 percent of them. Still, Commissioner Harvey said she was determined to spruce up as many campgrounds as possible, noting that the social-service groups that lease the cabins at Harriman -- approximately 40 miles north of Midtown Manhattan -- provided an indelible experience for disadvantaged children.
''About 25,000 kids go through these camps at Harriman each summer,'' Ms. Harvey said. ''Many of them don't go to parks and don't have the skills, whether it's swimming or hiking, to fully enjoy them. We're targeting our capital to fix camp structures to make sure they are safe and accessible.''
Whether the current financing is part of a new trend for state parks remains to be seen. Ms. DiBetta said she hoped the money represented a down payment on a ''multiyear commitment,'' with $100 million dedicated to capital improvements in each of the next 10 years.
Commissioner Harvey was more circumspect. ''We're hopeful that New York Works will go forward,'' she said, referring to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's program to rebuild the state's infrastructure while creating jobs. ''But between what we wish and what we're able to do, there's often a divide.''

HEADLINE: Costco Shares Rise on Improved Earnings

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Costco continues to draw more shoppers and sign up new members, giving the wholesale club operator higher net income and revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter. The company's performance beat Wall Street's expectations, and its shares touched a record high on Wednesday before easing a bit. 
Consumers have been drawn to stores like Costco, BJ's Wholesale Club and Sam's Club because they feel that they are getting bargains by buying items in bulk. Memberships at such stores have risen in recent years as shoppers worried about the economy and high unemployment look for ways to save money.
For the quarter ended Sept. 2, the Costco Wholesale Corporation reported Wednesday that it earned $609 million, or $1.39 a share. That is 27 percent increase over the $478 million, or $1.08 a share, that the company earned a year earlier.
Analysts had predicted earnings of $1.31 a share, according to a FactSet survey.
Costco's shares closed up $1.92, or 1.9 percent, at $101.56, after trading as high as $104.43 earlier in the session.
Total revenue increased 14 percent to $32.22 billion from $28.18 billion as sales improved and the Issaquah, Wash., company made more money from membership fees. Wall Street had expected revenue of $31.59 billion.
There was an extra week in the latest quarter.
Membership fee income totaled $694 million in the quarter as renewal rates came in at about 90 percent. New memberships climbed 2 percent from a year ago. The company said that there were also more shoppers visiting its clubs.
Sales of softlines, which can include items like clothing and footwear, posted a high single-digit percentage increase, with small electric appliances among the strongest within the category. Sales of food and small items like toiletries rose by a mid-single-digit percentage, as did hardlines, which can include hardware and lawn and garden products.
Online sales climbed 14 percent.
Revenue at stores open at least a year, an important gauge of a retailer's health, climbed 5 percent. The figure rose 6 percent in the United States and 2 percent internationally. It is a crucial performance indicator for retailers because it excludes results from stores recently opened or closed.

HEADLINE: U.S. Will Place Tariffs On Chinese Solar Panels

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL and KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The Commerce Department issued its final ruling Wednesday in a long-simmering trade dispute with China, imposing tariffs ranging from about 24 to nearly 36 percent on most solar panels imported from the country.
The penalties are somewhat lower than those announced by the department earlier this year, when the government determined that Chinese companies were benefiting from unfair government subsidies and were selling their products in the United States below the cost of production, a practice known as dumping.
For one of the biggest panel makers, Suntech, the duties are slightly higher, moving to almost 36 percent from about 34 percent. 
The trade case stemmed from a legal filing nearly a year ago by a coalition of manufacturers, led by SolarWorld, a German company with considerable manufacturing in the United States. The coalition contended that Chinese companies, which dominate global sales with a two-thirds market share, were competing unfairly in the American market.
''This is another important step in returning the solar marketplace in the United States to fair competition,'' said Timothy C. Brightbill, a lawyer representing the companies that brought the case.
At the same time, Mr. Brightbill said, he was concerned that the Commerce Department did not expand the scope of the ruling, which applies to panels made up of Chinese-produced solar cells. That has allowed companies to sidestep the duties by assembling panels composed of cells produced elsewhere, even if their components come from China. ''We are looking to the administration for an explanation on how they will close or address this loophole in the scope.''
The Chinese government had no immediate response to the decision, which was issued in the early hours of the morning Beijing time.
Some opponents of the tariffs said the ruling might not benefit the struggling United States manufacturers as much as SolarWorld and its supporters had hoped, given that Chinese firms could still make panels with cells produced in other countries.
''The fact that the Department of Commerce didn't expand the scope means that those companies aren't going to be banned from doing business in the U.S.,'' said Jigar Shah, an entrepreneur representing a group of companies that opposed the tariffs. ''We really think the Department of Commerce came down on the side of free trade.''
Shayle Kann, the head of GTM Research, a unit of Greentech Media, agreed. ''There's an impact there, but it's not huge in terms of what it does to the market,'' he said.
Wholesale prices have declined by nearly three-quarters since 2008 as Chinese companies expanded capacity and production much faster than the growth in worldwide demand. When China began the rapid expansion of its solar industry several years ago, many in the global industry expected that further technological breakthroughs would result in additional cost reductions.
But Chinese companies have driven costs down mainly through greater economies of scale from building ever-larger factories to produce conventional solar panels.
About a dozen panel makers in the United States, as well as a similar number in Europe, have gone bankrupt or closed factories since the start of last year. The European Union began the world's largest antidumping case, covering solar panel imports from China that totaled $26.5 billion last year. The trade case has divided the American solar industry, with some manufacturers and installers siding with SolarWorld and others strongly opposing the tariffs.
The opponents argue that the duties would make it more expensive for American families and companies to install solar systems.
American manufacturers of factory equipment and raw materials have also expressed concern that the trade measures could imperil their sales to China, whose government began its own investigation into whether American and South Korean manufacturers of polysilicon, the main ingredient in the solar panels, were selling the material below cost.
Steve Ostrenga, chief executive of the panel maker Helios Solar Works USA of Milwaukee, who supported the trade case, said in a statement after Wednesday's ruling that he was confident ''that American manufacturers can compete with China on an equal footing.''
''Assuming an adequate response from the Obama administration on enforcement, we have some hope that there will continue to be a viable solar manufacturing base in the United States,'' Mr. Ostrenga said.
Although the Commerce Department's decision is final, the tariffs cannot go into effect unless the International Trade Commission finds that the Chinese pricing practices have actually harmed or threatened to harm the American industry, a determination that is not expected until November. But the commission issued a preliminary ruling that such injury had occurred, and reversals are uncommon, particularly if the domestic industry is in trouble.
The Commerce Department calculated separate penalties for unfair subsidies and dumping, reducing the antidumping penalties from the preliminary ruling for most of the manufacturers while sharply increasing the antisubsidy duties after finding that companies had benefited from additional subsidies.
But to avoid double-counting duties, the department reduced the rates importers will have to pay.

HEADLINE: The Education of Tony Marx

BYLINE: By JACOB BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
EVERYWHERE Tony Marx goes, he does a lot of smiling and nodding. As the president of the New York Public Library (a job he took over in July 2011, after eight years as the president of Amherst), it is his job to smile and nod at big-name writers around whom the library plans events.
It is his job to smile and nod at the business leaders who serve on his board. It is his job to smile and nod at heads of foundation boards, at members of the City Council and officials in the Bloomberg administration, whom he lobbies for money and patronage, since the library (like most publicly financed institutions) has been subject to brutal budget cuts over the last four years.
Anyway, smiling and nodding are certainly what he was doing on an early September evening at a cocktail party for the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art at the Museum of Arts and Design at 2 Columbus Circle, working the room, introducing himself to anyone and everyone, offering tours, giving pats on the back and providing reassurances to people who appeared to be slightly wary of him. 
Mr. Marx has had to reassure a lot of people of late.
Last November, right on the eve of the annual Library Lions dinner, he was arrested in Harlem at 2 p.m. on a Sunday after he sideswiped a parked truck with a library-owned vehicle. Mr. Marx then failed a Breathalyzer test, which determined that he had a blood-alcohol level of 0.19, more than twice the legal limit of 0.08. (Mr. Marx pleaded guilty to charges of driving while intoxicated and was ordered to pay a $500 fine, give up his license for six months and attend counseling.)
Hello, New York!
The arrest was, of course, big news in the tabloids, and for a while it appeared as if Mr. Marx's tenure as the library's president might be short-lived. But despite having what several board members described as ''intense conversations'' about his future, they ultimately decided not to fire him. Recently, in an interview in his office, he declined to discuss the incident except to say, ''It was a stupid mistake and it won't happen again.''
In April, Mr. Marx was again in the news, this time when a host of big-name writers and scholars, including Salman Rushdie, Tom Stoppard and Jonathan Lethem, took a stand against the board of trustees' plan to move off site millions of rare books in the 42nd Street flagship (because of budget cuts, they explained), while plans were being completed to spend $300 million to have the space there spruced up by the star-architect Norman Foster. Opposition also came in a 5,300-word cover story in The Nation, then a two-part series in the literary journal N+1.
Resistance to the plan crystallized with an Op-Ed article for The New York Times written by Edmund Morris, and headlined ''Sacking a Palace of Culture.'' In it, Mr. Morris, a biographer of Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, referred to himself as ''a habitué of all of that great institution's research facilities'' and explained that ''it was with a surge of emotion, therefore, that I read newspaper reports about the determination of Anthony W. Marx, the president of the library, to spend $300 million to transform the main building, long devoted to reference, into what sounds like a palace of presentism.''
No matter that the plan was under way well before Mr. Marx had assumed the presidency of the library; he was now the public face of a dispute that seemed poised to divide the city's cultural and business communities.
Yet on this recent Wednesday evening, you would not have thought Mr. Marx was a man under siege. In fact, there seemed to be something of a spring in his step. He posed for photos with foundation staff members, joked with Nan Keohane, the former president of Wellesley, and chatted with a historian named Susan Zuccotti, who had done her dissertation at the library and took the opportunity to let Mr. Marx know that she was ''very concerned'' about the plan. Very concerned indeed.
''My big problem is,'' she said, ''not so much now, but I had three kids. If I'd had to wait three or four or five days to get a book, it would be very difficult -- -- ''
Mr. Marx, holding a glass of Diet Coke and listening politely, took this is as a moment to make a gentle interruption. The library had hoped, Mr. Marx told her, to ''encourage people to order in advance. That doesn't work. So I believe the board will vote next week to change the plan so that basically all the books on site are going to stay on site.''
''Well, that is fantastic!'' Ms. Zuccotti said. ''That's fantastic news.''
Mr. Marx smiled and nodded.
ON paper, Anthony W. Marx, 53, would seem like an ideal candidate to run the nation's largest public library system. Like many of his predecessors, most notably the near-legendary Vartan Gregorian, he was a well-regarded academic. And at Amherst, he proved himself not only a popular leader, but also an effective fund-raiser who in 2009 presided over what the college heralded as the largest unrestricted cash gift ever made to a liberal arts college ($100 million), a skill that would be crucial for anyone taking on the perennially cash-strapped library.
But there was more.
Mr. Marx grew up using his own branch of the library in Inwood, where his parents were anything but rich. His mother was a physical therapist and his father (whose education stopped at high school) worked at a steel trading company.
At Yale, which Mr. Marx transferred to after two years at Wesleyan, he studied political science and did his senior thesis on Plato's Academy, using it to discuss the role of education in society.
He went to graduate school at Princeton and studied with Albert Hirschman, the father of development economics. Mr. Marx also ventured to South Africa, spending 3 ½ years, on and off, working for a nongovernmental organization that set up a school for black students whose education had been stymied by apartheid.
Shortly after getting his Ph.D., Mr. Marx joined the political science department of Columbia University in 1990, and met his future wife, the sociology professor Karen Barkey, whom he married two years later. (The couple have two children and now live near Columbia in faculty housing.)
In 2003, he was hired as the president of Amherst, a school that was known for being politically left-leaning, but conservative when it came to getting anything done in the way of reform. A particular focus for Mr. Marx was diversifying the student body, bringing in not only more minorities, but also international students, veterans and the middle-aged.
It wasn't always a seamless process, and some professors complained that Mr. Marx was arrogant and talked too much about democracy when his management style was fairly autocratic.
''Faculty members wanted to be consulted more,'' said Amrita Basu, a professor of political science and women's and gender studies there. ''They felt Tony was trying to change too much too quickly.''
But the board of the New York Public Library, which heard a fair amount about these skirmishes, thought that if anything, this made him more qualified for the job, not less.
Said Joshua Steiner, a former chief of staff in the Treasury Department under Bill Clinton and a vice chairman of the board of trustees at the library, ''If you look at Tony's experience in a complex environment pushing through meaningful change, that to my mind was a clear and important indicator of his willingness to think deeply about issues and to believe strongly in the importance of change.''
And by the time Mr. Marx left Amherst, it was being heralded as a beacon of change, offering a higher percentage of its student body financial aid than almost any other liberal arts college in America.
IN 1981, the New York Public Library, broke and facing a slew of terrible options, hired Mr. Gregorian, an Armenian academic and an expert in Asian studies, to help rescue the place.
''When I accepted the presidency, someone told me to see a psychiatrist,'' he recalled in a recent interview. ''Because we were bankrupt.''
At his first meeting, the agenda was how to shut down the branches, sell off the collections and charge the public admission at the central library.
It was time for a savior, and one arrived in the form of Brooke Astor, the socialite and philanthropist, then in her late 70s, but still a formidable force on the city's social scene, which she would remain almost until her death at 105 in 2007.
Mrs. Astor had recently been sidelined at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and was looking for something to do. ''They'd invoked a clause making her an emeritus and she didn't feel very emeritus at all,'' said the journalist Meryl Gordon, who wrote the biography ''Mrs. Astor Regrets.''
So Mrs. Astor called Mr. Gregorian, and they joined forces with Richard Salomon and Andrew Heiskell (a former chief executive of Time Inc.) to begin a huge fund-raising effort. Soon enough, in came big donors like the real estate developer Marshall Rose, and the heiress Celeste Bartos. The library began holding increasingly high-profile readings with authors and started giving galas like the library Lions dinner, which had its first event later that year.
Tables cost $10,000 each, and the guest list (much of which came from Mrs. Astor's formidable Rolodex) rivaled any state dinner. Look over there: it's Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis! And a hop, skip and a jump away, Norman Mailer and Arthur Schlesinger Jr. Not to mention countless other Social X-rays, who, to quote Ms. Gordon, ''realized that if they donated to the library, they'd get invited to dinner.''
In short order, junkies disappeared from the steps of the central library, the facade was cleaned up and scores of curators were hired. Services at the branches around the city improved considerably.
The library was a hot institution, one that bestowed upon its benefactors a decided social cachet -- something that future presidents would come to rely on. (On Oct. 22, as a fund-raiser for the library, the board will stage a reading of works by Nora Ephron, this reporter's mother.)
In 1989, after Mr. Gregorian left to become the president of Brown University (he's now the president of the Carnegie Corporation), the organization was taken over by the Rev. Timothy S. Healy, a Jesuit priest and former president of Georgetown University, who three years into the job died of a heart attack. As his successor, the board tapped Paul LeClerc, a Voltaire scholar with prodigious fund-raising skills.
Over the next few years, the library raised $100 million in donations to open the Science and Business Library at 34th Street and Madison Avenue. In 2001, the organization completed a $38 million renovation of the performing arts library at Lincoln Center.
But with the financial crisis of 2008 came severe budget cuts from the city. The science library and the mid-Manhattan branch (on 39th Street) fell into disrepair. The size of the research staff declined by almost 30 percent. Meanwhile, the main branch at 42nd and Fifth was being closed down with increasing frequency for corporate events -- a necessary fund-raising move but one that rankled staff members, some of whom complained that a monument to intellectual life was turning into a nightclub.
Even a $100 million gift from the financier Stephen Schwarzman, earmarked for the upgrade of the central building, did little to quell a sense among the rank and file that the library board was perhaps more interested in the building's housing than the books inside it.
What to make of Kanye West's appearance at a Paper Magazine gala celebrating the magazine's 25th anniversary? Or the fact that at a 2011 Thom Browne fashion show, in the Edna Barnes Salomon Room, there were models kneeling before a makeshift altar as Gregorian chants blared? An indication that the library was successfully moving into the 21st century, or proof that it had totally, completely, lost its way?
''We began to say that it was going to be Cipriani Fifth Avenue,'' recalled one recently retired senior administrator, who asked to remain anonymous because of a separation agreement he signed with the library.
''I'd be in the elevator and there'd be a blond girl in a little black dress who worked in development escorting people around and saying, 'You have to mention in your release that this is in the Stephen A. Schwarzman building.' I can't tell you how many times we dismantled really serious pieces of equipment that cost us millions of dollars to acquire so that we could have a free rein for, oh, runway shows during the February and September fashion weeks.''
''We have existential questions to ask,'' Mr. Marx was saying as a spokeswoman hovered nearby. ''How do we build and deploy our staff to meet the educational needs of this city? How do we ensure that we are providing ideas and information to New Yorkers and to the world at a moment when that is all becoming digital while preserving our great book collection?''
He was sitting in his office at the central library, and if it sounded a bit like a script he had delivered before, well, that's probably because Mr. Marx was reading from a page of notes he had come prepared with.
''So I had a lot to learn and we have big decisions to make,'' he continued, in a conversation that went on for more than an hour. ''And that generated considerable debate, as it should, as we try to make the smartest decisions we can going forward.''
Eventually, Mr. Marx got up from the table and embarked on a tour of the library, going first to the rooms that the library plans to renovate. ''This should be filled with library users,'' he said entering one such room, which had a view of Bryant Park and was being used for storage. ''I'm going to start to reopen these rooms. Because there is no reason they shouldn't be filled with people doing library work.''
He walked into the Rose Main Reading Room, pausing to give a pat on the back to the security guard.
''Literally every seat is filled. Every seat is filled, and everyone practically has a computer in front of them,'' he pointed out, adding that some of those computers belonged to the library.
''And you walk up and down and you see that relatively few people are using our books. Right? Which raises an interesting question. Why are they here? Well, partly they're here for computers and Wi-Fi, but mostly they're here because it's an unbelievably inspiring space. And because people actually want to work in inspiring spaces together, not at home alone. And that's not going to change.''
This went on for a while, his voice trailing off, as Mr. Marx walked the reporter out of the room, giving the security guard another fraternal pat as the two went by.
CALL up people who work with Mr. Marx, and some of the things you will hear repeatedly are that he's a ''little slick,'' that the volume is always ''on high,'' and that he continues to speak to groups of adults the way he might have spoken to his students at Amherst or Columbia.
But Jide Zeitlin, a former board chairman at Amherst who helped recruit Mr. Marx to the college and who has now been friends with him for roughly a decade, said that this was slightly unfair.
''There are some people who pull it off really effortlessly, so that it looks like they aren't really trying,'' Mr. Zeitlin said. ''It's like the duck, smooth on the surface and paddling like mad underneath. Personality-wise, that's not Tony. He is at times too transparent, so what you see is what you get. But I'd argue it's honesty. ... He cares about what he's doing.''
Others caution that he deserves time and the benefit of the doubt as he grows into his new position.
''Tony's a good scholar,'' Mr. Gregorian said. ''He has democratic principles and he's learning about bureaucracy and the various constituencies of the library. I'm confident he'll do his best.''
And increasingly, members of the board -- among them Louise Grunwald, Gayfryd Steinberg and Marshall Rose -- seem to be moving into his corner. A couple of weeks back, at a board meeting where Mr. Marx revealed an $8 million pledge from the trustee Abby Milstein and her husband, Howard, to keep the bulk of the books on site, the board announced that the library had raised $98 million in charitable contributions in the last fiscal year, a result of 329 meetings Mr. Marx had with potential donors and a record for the most money raised in a single fiscal year.
Annette de la Renta was there smiling brightly. Nearby were David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, and Ms. Grunwald. Before the meeting started, Mr. Marx greeted a group of scholars who sat anxiously in the front row and Mr. Schwarzman, to whom he gave a big pat on the back.
When it came time for him to speak, Mr. Marx thanked people on the board, whose work had made it possible for him to raise so much money. Then he thanked the scholars, whose protestations led the board to roll back part of the central library plan.
''We're really grateful to everyone who contributed, even loudly at times,'' he said. ''That's how I think democracy should work. It's certainly how I think publicly supported institutions should work.''
Said Mr. Rose afterward: ''I've lived through four presidents, and he has a real ability to know when he's wrong and to see when things can be improved. I think he's doing great.''
Mr. Steiner concurred: ''I don't think that the first year has been perfect or that everything has been seamless, but I do feel, and I think the vast majority of trustees agree, that we've made meaningful progress. And that while there were moments of discomfort, we would happily trade off that discomfort for the progress we've made. That reflects the trustees and the staff and Tony's work.''
That work also includes an ambitious plan, announced by Mr. Marx and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in late September, to turn every public school student into a member of the New York Public Library.
The way the program will work, said Mr. Marx, is that ''over the course of three years, every school in New York will end up with computers and its library connected to a circulating system that combines the Brooklyn, Queens and New York Public Library, which in total have 17 million circulating items. Students and teachers can order online whatever books they need, for whatever research they're doing at that point, and we will deliver to them the books that they need.''
Scholars continue to be skeptical about parts of the central library plan, but Mr. Marx has clearly ingratiated himself to them somewhat in recent weeks.
''I think he has politician written all over him,'' said Annalyn Swan, who in 2005 won the Pulitzer Prize (with Mark Stevens) for ''De Kooning: An American Master'' and has been one of the most vociferous critics of the central library plan. ''But there are better politicians and worse politicians, and he seems to be a better politician.''
As the dispute over the central library plan dies down, Mr. Marx is choosing to see the sunny side of things. ''The good news,'' he said after leaving the Doris Duke Foundation event, walking toward the nearby Time Warner Center, ''is that people are talking about the library. What they want it to be and what they don't want it to be, rather than taking it for granted and letting it sink. Right?''
At which point he walked into another lobby, got on another elevator, on his way to another cocktail party, another Diet Coke, and more smiling and nodding.

HEADLINE: Colleges Look to Supreme Court for Clues

BYLINE: By RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA

 BODY:
As the Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday in a case challenging race-conscious admission to public colleges, university officials across the country watched for clues to where the court might go while contemplating what steps schools might take if the court changed the state of the law.
Administrators who paid close attention -- following the arguments on blogs or reading the transcript -- looked most carefully at the words of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, widely seen as the swing vote on the case. But in asking tough, skeptical questions of both sides, Justice Kennedy left them no clear indication which way he will go. 
Schools are bracing for three broad categories of possible outcomes in the case, Fisher v. University of Texas: a complete and history-making ban on race-conscious admissions, a tightening of the current limitations on consideration of race or ethnicity, or a decision that more or less leaves things as they are. The result will turn largely on the court's reading of its 2003 decision in Grutter v. Bollinger, when the justices, by 5 to 4, ruled that schools may take race into account as one factor among many, as long as they do not use numerical quotas. A decision will be issued next year.
''An outcome a lot of us in higher education are contemplating is that they could affirm Grutter, at least in name, but impose a stricter definition of what it allows,'' said John C. Boger, dean of the law school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and an author of a brief that school submitted to the court in support of the University of Texas.
''Then the question becomes, do they make the test for race-conscious action so tough that no one could ever pass it?''
Such a ruling, just as surely as an outright ban on consideration of race, would force the more-selective public colleges to change their admissions practices. (Many of the nation's public schools have open admissions, meaning that they take anyone whose high school credentials are above a certain threshold; they would not be affected by the ruling.)
Seven states already ban any consideration of race in admission to state schools, and to varying degrees, their colleges have responded with ''race-blind'' ways to achieve diversity, like distributing admissions among all public high schools, recruiting aggressively in poorer communities and giving some preference to low-income applicants and those from underperforming schools.
A report released last week by the Century Foundation argued that alternatives to affirmative action can work reasonably well in producing ethnic diversity, and much better in producing economic diversity.
In California, whose ban has been in place longest -- voters approved it in 1996 -- the highly competitive University of California system has tried several approaches, with varying results.
One approach in particular now being used in Texas, California and elsewhere, has won admirers: trying to spread admissions by community rather than race. That can mean giving preference to low-income students and those who go to low-performing schools, recruiting aggressively in poorer areas and, most often, admitting a certain percentage of students from the top of the class at every high school in the state.
''I don't know anybody who's opposed to that, in principle, but it has not allowed us to achieve the level of diversity we'd like to see, particularly at our most selective campuses, Berkeley and U.C.L.A.,'' said David M. Birnbaum, chief deputy general counsel of the University of California system.
''I think most educators believe in the importance and value of diversity, and if some avenues are closed to them to achieve that, they'll look for others, but it's not an easy thing to do.''
Mr. Boger said his colleagues had studied how a ''percentage plan'' would work at the University of North Carolina, and found that while it would admit nearly as many blacks and Hispanics, it would also significantly lower the caliber of students.
In addition, educators noted that if they could not take race into account, there was no guarantee that all public universities would go to the same lengths that California has to achieve diversity. Some even speculated that their states' lawmakers might block such measures.

HEADLINE: Addressing Britain's Conservative Party, Mayor Likens Its Governing Style to His

BYLINE: By RAVI SOMAIYA

 BODY:
LONDON -- Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg addressed Britain's governing Conservative Party on Wednesday, seeking to emphasize his ties to the country and to link his governing style to the milder brand of conservatism embodied by the right wing here. 
The speech by Mr. Bloomberg, at the party's annual conference in Britain's second-largest city, Birmingham, was a warm-up for Prime Minister David Cameron's keynote address. The mayor spoke of his close ties with Britain (he has a home on Cadogan Square, one of the most exclusive addresses in London) and framed his decade in New York's City Hall as inspired by prominent British conservatives.
Taking the stage to warm applause, Mr. Bloomberg spoke of his admiration for Winston Churchill and said he shared Churchill's belief in ''putting the common good beyond party politics and the next election.'' Both he and Churchill had defied definite party affiliation, said Mr. Bloomberg, a former Democrat and Republican who is now a political independent.
Mr. Bloomberg noted that his former wife was British and that his daughters had British passports. His company, Bloomberg L.P., employs 2,600 people here, he added, and he mentioned its new London headquarters.
Mr. Bloomberg noted that both he and Mr. Cameron had taken office amid crises -- the mayor in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and the prime minister during the world economic crash.
Mr. Bloomberg said he and Mr. Cameron had each made difficult decisions on the economy, a reference to the sweeping austerity measures Mr. Cameron has introduced. Balancing his own city budget, Mr. Bloomberg said, involved ''raising taxes and cutting spending, and let me tell you, that didn't make me the most popular man in New York.''
He cited a series of statistics that he said showed his pragmatism had yielded results: Crime was down 30 percent, he said, high school graduations were up 40 percent and welfare claims were down 20 percent.
The speech was not the first effort by Mr. Bloomberg and senior officials from City Hall or his company to position him in Britain as a pragmatic and effective leader. His aides, on several visits this year, have courted the press corps with a series of dinners. His company's new London headquarters, one aide suggested, may later house franchises of classic New York restaurants in an effort to export the city's brand here.
In private, British government officials exchange stories about Mr. Bloomberg that range from envious to admiring, and occasionally, as with his restrictions on the sale of large sodas, puzzled.
Conservative officials, who have felt hampered by their coalition government with a liberal party here, also expressed admiration for the New York police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, who visited London before the Olympic Games this summer. ''They run things a bit like we'd like to,'' one official said, ''if we didn't have to worry about inconveniences like compromise.''

HEADLINE: Democrats At the Deep End

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
It's a tough time to be a Democrat.
When Democrats run into each other in elevators, they exchange glances and sigh. Or make little whimpering sounds.
They read post-Denver bloggers like Andrew Sullivan (''Obama has instantly plummeted into near-oblivion.'') and find themselves spending their evenings watching ''House Hunters International.'' The real estate market in Cuzco, they note, is sort of intriguing.
Democrats walk around repeating the comeback lines they would have given if they had been debating Mitt Romney in Colorado. (''Maybe you need a new accountant? Yeah, and a new calculator, and a new ...'') 
They tell each other that now it's all up to Joe Biden.
They wander around the neighborhood, buttonholing perfect strangers, demanding the name of one -- one! -- tax loophole that Mitt Romney has actually said he'd close.
Democrats are going bipolar. Half the time they are grabbing at random bits of hopeful information. (An Esquire/Yahoo poll shows most Americans would rather go on a road trip with Obama!) Half the time they are in total despair. Nothing makes them happy. Show them that cute picture of the lioness befriending the orphan baby antelope that's gone viral, and they will point out that the only reason the antelope is an orphan is because the lioness ate its mother.
Before falling asleep, they think about how smart Joe Biden is when it comes to foreign affairs.
Everything reminds them of the election. They hear Diane Sawyer talking about people who've gotten meningitis from steroid injections and they do not think about alternate therapy for back pain. They start yelling at the TV: ''Yeah! Let's not have overreaching federal regulation of those compounding companies! Let the states do it. The states are great at this stuff!''
Democrats spend all their waking hours thinking about the swing states. If Wisconsin starts looking wobbly, their day is ruined. They leap out of bed in the morning and race to the computer to see where the trend lines are going in Colorado.
Calm down and leave Colorado alone! Also, stop talking about getting into a bus and going door to door in Ohio. Research shows that undecided voters are most likely to be swayed by their friends and neighbors. East Coast Democrats, no one in Zanesville is going to believe you are their neighbor.
Democrats miss Seamus.
Yes, those were the days. When the very mention of ''Mitt Romney'' would instantly lead to a discussion of the dangers of transporting an Irish setter to Canada on the roof of a station wagon.
''Has Seamus peaked too early?'' a worried Democrat asked me in Texas a while back. At the time, I thought that anybody who is a Democrat in Texas had so many things to worry about, it was a miracle he could even remember the dog's name. But now it's clear that he was totally right. Seamus was so June.
All Democrats have now is Big Bird. Plus worrying about whether they're talking too much about Big Bird.
Plus Joe Biden, who has a very nice smile.
You have to calm down, Democrats. Romney hasn't turned into some new supercandidate. You were just underestimating him during September. He's the same old Mitt. This week in Des Moines, he told an editorial board that he doesn't have any plans for pushing anti-abortion bills if he's elected. (''There's no legislation with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda.'') Meanwhile, back at headquarters, his spokeswoman was assuring National Review that he ''would, of course, support legislation aimed at providing greater protections for life.''
Maybe this will come up in the vice-presidential debate. Do you remember how well Joe Biden did against Sarah Palin?
Things haven't really gone off the deep end for the Obama campaign. They've gone back to normal. You knew that the Obama-is-going-to-win-by-10-points euphoria wasn't going to last. When did anybody ever win a presidential race by 10 points? Don't tell me about Ronald Reagan. When Ronald Reagan was president, gas was 90 cents a gallon and I was writing on a Kaypro.
Maybe Democrats should try to be more like the Republicans, and reduce stress by blaming all bad news on incorrect information, cooked up by cabals of political partisans.
Although you can't be overly sensitive about it. Jack Welch, who has been famous for his tender spirit ever since he ran General Electric, was outraged when he ran into flak for claiming that the ''Chicago guys'' had cooked the unemployment statistics.
''Imagine a country,'' Welch wrote indignantly in The Wall Street Journal, ''where challenging the ruling authorities -- questioning, say, a piece of data released by central headquarters -- would result in mobs of administration sympathizers claiming you should feel 'embarrassed' and labeling you a fool, or worse.''
Perhaps we should all work on feeling sorry for Jack Welch.

HEADLINE: Citing Deep Data Collections, Senator Opens Inquiry of Information Brokers

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
The multibillion-dollar data brokerage industry, a growing force in online marketing, is drawing intensified government scrutiny.
On Wednesday, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, opened an extensive investigation of nine leading information brokers. Because Americans now conduct much of their daily business online, the senator said he was concerned that ''an unprecedented amount'' of personal, medical and financial information about people could be collected, mined and sold, to the potential detriment of consumers.
''An ever-increasing percentage of their lives will be available for download, and the digital footprint they will inevitably leave behind will become more specific and potentially damaging, if used improperly,'' Mr. Rockefeller, who is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, wrote in letters to the data brokers. ''It is critical that we understand what information companies like yours are already collecting and selling.'' 
Linda A. Woolley, the acting chief executive of the Direct Marketing Association, a trade group, called the senator's investigation ''a baseless fishing expedition.''
''I hope Senator Rockefeller understands what he's tampering with,'' she said in an e-mailed statement.
The Senate investigation represents the second Congressional inquiry into the industry's practices this year. In July, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, co-chairmen of the Bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus, began a House inquiry into data compilers, which is ongoing. And the Federal Trade Commission has been looking into the practices of about a dozen major data brokers.
Data brokers collect a wide variety of information from public sources and third parties, including details like consumers' financial status, race or ethnicity, buying history, hobbies, health concerns, travel preferences, Internet providers and social networks.
The companies often use the information for a practice called ''database marketing'' -- that is, using data mining to help clients like retailers, banks and airlines tailor marketing pitches to their best customers or identify potential new ones.
Collecting, analyzing and selling such information for marketing purposes is perfectly legal. Indeed, it's a huge business. Some data brokers have said they maintain several thousand details on the majority of adults in the United States.
But some legislators and regulators say they are concerned that neither they nor consumers know the extent of the material that data brokers collect; whom they disclose or sell it to; and exactly what they are doing with it.
Unlike consumer reporting agencies, which are required by federal law to show people their own credit reports and allow them to correct errors, data brokers are not required to show consumers information collected about them for marketing purposes.
Earlier this year in a report on protecting consumer privacy, the F.T.C. urged the industry to create a centralized Web portal where consumers could learn about companies' practices and their options for controlling information collected about them. The agency also recommended that Congress pass legislation giving people access to information that data brokers hold about them. Underlying regulators' efforts is their concern that some information brokers could create financial dossiers about individuals that are akin to credit reports and use them to unfairly exclude individual consumers from certain offers or charge some people higher prices than others.
''There are data brokers whose marketing lists may not cross the line into credit reports but come very close,'' said Julie Brill, a member of the F.T.C. ''The question is whether the lists are being used for marketing purposes or for something very close to credit purposes.''
Industry representatives say that data-based marketers use consumer marketing data for legitimate commercial practices, not for regulated purposes like making offers of credit or insurance.
They add that collecting marketing data benefits consumers because it allows companies to send people offers for products and services they are interested in. It also increases efficiency because companies know ahead of time not to send pitches for, say, lawn mowers to people who live in apartments.
''Consumers love getting what they want -- information, products, benefits, upgrades -- when they want it,'' said Ms. Woolley of the Direct Marketing Association. ''There is no evidence that data-driven marketing harms consumers in any way.''
On Wednesday, Mr. Rockefeller sent letters of inquiry to established database marketers like Acxiom, headquartered in Little Rock, Ark.; credit reporting agencies like Experian and Equifax, which have separate marketing arms; and newer companies, like Rapleaf and Datalogix, that specialize in helping companies pursue online and mobile consumers.
Mr. Rockefeller asked each company to provide extensive business details about its data collection operations since Jan. 1, 2009.
Scott Howe, the chief executive of Acxiom, said the company looked ''forward to continuing to work with the Congress to help the members gain a deeper understanding of Acxiom's business and how people and the economy benefit from the appropriate use of data.''
In an e-mail, Demitra L. Wilson, a spokeswoman for Equifax, said the company is not a data broker and that the only a small portion of its business involves unregulated, aggregated data about consumers.
And Gerry Tschopp, a spokesman for Experian, said the company welcomed the opportunity to discuss ''the benefits of the appropriate use of consumer data'' with legislators.
Representatives of Datalogix and Rapleaf did not immediately respond to e-mail and phone requests for comment.
Mr. Rockefeller asked the companies to respond by Nov. 2.

HEADLINE: This Election, A Stark Choice In Health Care

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH and ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
Joyce Beck, who runs a small hospital and network of medical clinics in rural Nebraska, is reluctant to plan for the future until voters decide between President Obama and Mitt Romney. The candidates' sharply divergent proposals for Medicare, Medicaid and coverage of the uninsured have created too much uncertainty, she explained.
''We are all on hold, waiting to see what the election brings,'' said Ms. Beck, chief executive of Thayer County Health Services in Hebron, Neb.
When Americans go to the polls next month, they will cast a vote not just for president but for one of two profoundly different visions for the future of the country's health care system. With an Obama victory on Nov. 6, the president's signature health care law -- including the contentious requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance or pay a tax penalty -- will almost certainly come into full force, becoming the largest expansion of the safety net since President Lyndon B. Johnson pushed through his Great Society programs almost half a century ago. 
If Mr. Romney wins and Republicans capture the Senate, much of the law could be repealed -- or its financing cut back -- and the president's goal of achieving near-universal coverage could take a back seat to Mr. Romney's top priority, controlling medical costs.
Given the starkness of the choice, historians and policy makers believe this election could be the most significant referendum on a piece of social legislation since 1936, when the Republican Alf M. Landon ran against Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal programs. (Nearly eight decades have passed, but the debate sounds strikingly familiar: Landon described the Social Security Act, passed in 1935, as ''the largest tax bill in history'' and called for its repeal.)
''It is very rare for a political party to pass a social program of this magnitude and then to face the possibility of a rollback or repeal in a presidential election,'' said James A. Morone, a professor of political science at Brown University who has studied the history of health policy.
For Medicare and Medicaid, the government health programs for older Americans, low-income people and the disabled, the candidates have sharply different visions as well. Mr. Romney's proposals call for fundamental changes in the structure of the programs, placing more emphasis on private-sector solutions and much less on government regulation.
Mr. Obama would expand Medicaid to cover millions more people; Mr. Romney would effectively shrink it, giving each state a fixed amount of federal money to cover its disadvantaged population with more control over eligibility and benefits. Mr. Romney would eventually give each Medicare beneficiary a fixed amount of federal money to pay premiums for either the traditional Medicare program or private insurance. Mr. Obama would preserve the structure of Medicare but try to rein in costs, in part by trimming payments to health care providers.
Passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 was, to many, Mr. Obama's most significant legislative accomplishment. But the law proved so divisive that undoing it has become a central rallying cry of Republicans seeking to retake the White House.
Julian E. Zelizer, a history and public affairs professor at Princeton, said that Mr. Obama ''has not embraced his own record with as much enthusiasm, passion and confidence'' as either Roosevelt or Johnson. But the president has, in recent weeks, responded more aggressively to the critics. He has even embraced the derisive term ''Obamacare,'' saying: ''I do care. That's why we passed the bill.''
Armed with data suggesting that the law is popular with crucial groups of voters -- including young people, women and Hispanics -- Mr. Obama plans to run more television commercials and distribute fliers taking credit for popular provisions of the 2010 health law and asserting that Mr. Romney would take away Medicare's ''guaranteed benefits.''
As seen in last week's presidential debate, the health care discussion has become a dizzying flurry of numbers, bold claims and counterclaims. But the outlines of what might happen under a Romney administration or a second Obama administration go something like this:
If Romney Wins
Even though he helped develop the landmark 2006 law that required most Massachusetts residents to have health insurance -- a model for the Obama law -- Mr. Romney has said repeatedly that he believes that requiring Americans to buy health insurance as national policy is the wrong approach. The focus should not be on increasing the number of insured Americans, his advisers say, so much as on controlling health costs by fixing the dysfunctional insurance market.
Mr. Romney has been less specific about what he will put in place if the law is repealed. But most of his ideas are aimed at bolstering market forces. One of the biggest problems, he says, is that people who get health insurance through their employers receive a tax break -- the value of employer contributions to their premiums is not counted as income -- while people who buy coverage in the individual insurance market generally get none. Mr. Romney says he would level the playing field by creating tax breaks for people who buy insurance on their own -- a measure that might encourage even those with the option of employer-sponsored coverage to buy their own plans instead.
''As a result,'' Mr. Romney said in a summary of his health care proposals in The New England Journal of Medicine, ''they will be price-sensitive, quality-conscious, and able to seek out the features they want.''
Mr. Romney believes that if more people buy coverage on their own, insurers will compete harder for their business, thus presumably lowering costs. And if insurance is separated from employment, the Romney campaign says, people will be able to keep their coverage if they lose or change jobs.
Paul Fronstin, an economist at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan organization, said the proposal would work only if Mr. Romney made additional efforts to bring down the cost of health care. In the past, he said, advocates of such proposals typically offered tax credits ranging from about $1,500 to $2,500 a year for an individual -- not necessarily enough to make coverage affordable.
''Will other things bring down premiums to make those tax credits more meaningful?'' Mr. Fronstin asked. ''That's an open question.''
The new health care law prohibits insurers from turning people away or charging them more because they are sick, and Mr. Romney says he will guarantee access to insurance for people with pre-existing conditions. But his guarantee would extend only to people who have maintained coverage without a significant gap. That means millions could still be rejected.
Mr. Romney says many of them could get coverage through health plans known as high-risk pools. Many states have such pools, but the coverage they offer can be prohibitively expensive.
If Obama Wins
If Mr. Obama is re-elected, he would step up efforts to carry out the health care law. Given the controversy over the law and the logistical challenge of setting up state insurance ''exchanges'' where people can shop for coverage, the transition will probably be rocky. But many doctors, hospitals and insurance companies are determined to make it work.
On Jan. 1, 2014, the requirement that most Americans have medical coverage takes effect. Private health plans will start enrolling people in October 2013. The result, according to the Congressional Budget Office, is that 30 million uninsured people will eventually gain coverage. To help them afford it, the federal government would subsidize private insurance premiums for people with incomes up to four times the federal poverty level ($92,200 for a family of four). And it would expand Medicaid to cover more poor people, including many adults without children.
Mr. Obama and Democrats in Congress have beaten back efforts to change the law before its major provisions take effect. But after the election, Congress will be under intense pressure to rein in deficits and debt, and lawmakers will focus anew on the costs of Medicare, Medicaid and the new health care law, which together could account for one-third of all federal spending in 2022.
Paul B. Ginsburg, president of the nonpartisan Center for Studying Health System Change, said that a willingness to compromise might help Mr. Obama persuade Republicans to accept the health care law if he wins a second term. For example, Mr. Ginsburg said, the president and Congressional Democrats might agree to delay the biggest, most expensive parts of the law for a year, giving the administration and states more time to prepare and saving a substantial amount of money. He also suggested that to help with deficit reduction, Mr. Obama and Congress might reduce the size of the federal subsidies meant to help middle-income people buy insurance.
In the 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama often told voters that he would lower premiums by $2,500 a year per family ''by the end of my first term as president.'' It has not happened, though the White House says the law has slowed the growth of premiums, in part by establishing new procedures to review proposed rate increases.
Some provisions of the law may tend to increase premiums in 2014. Insurers and health policy experts say young adults could face higher premiums because of a provision that limits how much rates can vary based on a person's age.
Whether Mr. Obama's law will slow the overall growth of health care costs remains to be seen. Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group, said a few provisions -- such as a new tax on high-priced health insurance plans, to take effect in 2018 -- could help rein in costs.
In the meantime, people like Sarah L. Moseley of Birmingham, Ala., are simply hoping that the next president and Congress will guarantee coverage at more affordable rates. Ms. Moseley, who has ovarian cancer, said she had been denied commercial insurance and was paying more than $600 a month for limited coverage in the state's high-risk pool.
''I don't have much longer to live,'' she said.

HEADLINE: 'Something Powerful' for Women in Berlin's Technology Universe

BYLINE: By MELISSA EDDY

 BODY:
BERLIN -- The Berlin Geekettes insist that they have no mission statement. But their reasoning reads like one: They describe themselves as ''a group of entrepreneurial women who share the belief that by organizing, exchanging stories, experiences, and building a community based on trust, something powerful can be created.''
And that ''something powerful'' is, for them, most certainly the power of women's getting together and multiplying their influence by helping one another.
This network, founded in February 2011, helps women in Berlin's rapidly expanding, grass-roots technology scene. 
The group has attracted hundreds of young women at a time when the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel is sharply divided over the merits of a quota to bring more women into German boardrooms. Ms. Merkel herself is a trained physicist and self-declared ''digital migrant'' who extols technology advances but says little explicitly on the advancement of women.
Berlin has gained international attention, and financing, as an incubator for technology start-ups in recent years. But there are no comparable high-profile female figures like those emerging in Silicon Valley in California: Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer at Facebook, or Marissa Mayer, the chief executive at Yahoo, for example.
''There are quite a lot of women out there who are just doing it,'' said Verena Delius, chief executive of Goodbeans, which creates apps for children. ''But we have to get organized. You need to have good role models who are very transparent about how they are doing it.''
There are several women in Berlin involved in interesting start-ups and technology projects or who founded their own companies. But none has achieved the widespread recognition of their male counterparts, said Jess Erickson, 28, who arrived in Berlin from New York in 2010.
Ms. Erickson cites Zoe Adamovicz as an example. At 33, Ms. Adamovicz, a native of Poland who came to the city to study at Humboldt University of Berlin, is chief executive of Xylogic. The company recently introduced a product to help smartphone users navigate the jungle of apps and is the newest of six that she has founded since 1999.
''Here's a woman who's sold many companies, built many companies, but she just doesn't have that much media presence,'' Ms. Erickson said of Ms. Adamovicz, a founding member of the Geekettes. ''I thought, 'Wouldn't it be cool to showcase these women and share their stories and inspire more young women to pursue their own dreams of founding their own company?'''
Ms. Erickson, originally from Minnesota, had met many tech-oriented women at events and in February 2011 invited seven of them to an Asian restaurant in central Berlin. They swapped career advice and tips, and the Berlin Geekettes were born.
The next steps included setting up a Facebook page, starting a blog and organizing regular meetings. Within months, membership rose to 50 and then to 100. By July of this year, about 220 women and girls were involved, and the Geekettes held a ''summer meet-up'' at Google's Berlin headquarters, with talks by Ms. Adamovicz and Caitlin Winner, co-founder of Amen, a social-networking company.
Slightly more than 2 percent of all working women in Germany are considered entrepreneurs or run their own companies, according to figures released in May by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That compares with just below 7 percent of all working men in Germany. If these numbers are to change, more girls and young women need support networks and other female leaders to serve as role models, the Geekettes say.
Caroline Drucker, the country manager in Germany for Etsy, an online marketplace for handmade and vintage goods, believes that diversity in gender, social background and age are essential in moving the tech industry forward. She pointed to the current definition of success, stemming from Silicon Valley.
''It's all about money, dreams of billion-dollar exits, and it's dominated by men,'' Ms. Drucker told a group of women gathered on a recent Saturday in Berlin to talk tech and learn from one another. ''A tech scene made up of different genders, ages, social backgrounds and problems to solve will lead to better thinking and better products.''
Another definition that must change is how women refer to themselves, Ms. Drucker said, citing groups similar to the Geekettes in which women refer to themselves as ''girls,'' thus sending a subtle but wrong message.
''A girl is supposed to be nonthreatening -- she's someone you can hang out with,'' Ms. Drucker said, insisting that the term undermines women's efforts to promote themselves.
Ms. Drucker and Ms. Delius, the Goodbeans chief executive, urge women to use every opportunity they get to speak at conferences as a way to build networks and command respect.
While Berlin's start-up scene has a spirit of inclusiveness, with Americans, Australians, Danes, Swedes and Spaniards in their 20s and 30s outnumbering their German colleagues at most companies, old-fashioned attitudes do persist.
Ms. Erickson recalled being told by the young, male head of a successful Berlin start-up that women ''just don't get tech'' and that he ''can't hire a female developer because they will distract all the male developers.''
Justin McMurray, an Australian who left London a year ago to start a recruiting company in Berlin, said that his experience had been the opposite. Women make up half of the six employees at his start-up, Somewhere, a creative recruitment business that relies on personality to match employers with job seekers.
''They just had the best ideas,'' Mr. McMurray said over a coffee at betahouse, a working space that has become a hub for entrepreneurs in the Kreuzberg neighborhood. He said most men he knew in Berlin shared his view that gender should not be an issue in hiring.
Ms. Delius, who is raising two children on her own, agrees. At Goodbeans, Ms. Delius said, she shares leadership with a man and they strive to reach the same balance in their staff.
''I tell women, 'Don't just go to a conference. Speak at a conference,''' she said. ''If you speak, more people will come up to you, and you will expand your network.''
Ms. Adamovicz, the Xylogic chief executive, said being a minority in an all-male environment could be an advantage. She said that as one of only three women in her class at her university in Warsaw, she believed that the attention she received helped her to get ahead.
''Attention is a very scarce good,'' Ms. Adamovicz said.
She insisted that femininity was an important ''soft power'' that women should not be afraid to use, especially in tough negotiations.
''Being exotic in an all-male environment is fabulous,'' she said. ''It allows you to be weird; it allows you to disrupt their little games.''
The Geekettes' next goal is to begin an internship program that will link a female founder or woman involved in the start-up scene with young women interested in technology.
''If you can show that women do exist within a tech scene, it can have an impact,'' Ms. Erickson said. ''We are often treated as a very small minority when in fact we are not.''

HEADLINE: West Is Foolish to Celebrate Iran's Currency Crisis, Ayatollah Says

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
Iran's supreme leader spoke out publicly for the first time on Wednesday about the country's foreign-exchange problems, describing the mass protest in Tehran last week over the plummeting Iranian currency as an anomaly that the West had gleefully but foolishly misinterpreted as a harbinger of crisis.
In a speech reported by Iranian news services, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also exhorted Iranians not to fear the intensifying regimen of Western sanctions over Iran's disputed nuclear program. Many outside economists have said the sanctions -- which have targeted Iran's oil and banking sectors -- have played an important role in weakening the rial, the national currency. 
The rial has lost roughly 40 percent of its value against the dollar this month and is down 80 percent against the dollar for the year.
''The issue of sanctions is not a new issue and has existed since the victory of the Islamic Revolution,'' the ayatollah said in his speech in North Khorasan Province. ''But the enemies are making efforts to blow the issue of sanctions out of proportion, and, unfortunately, certain people inside are assisting them.''
The remarks by Ayatollah Khamenei, who has the final word on affairs of state, appeared to reinforce his policy of absolute defiance in the face of Western pressure, and offered a hint that some officials in Iran are ambivalent about that strategy.
The ayatollah has long insisted that sanctions would never force Iran into suspending its uranium enrichment program, which Western nations suspect is a guise for developing nuclear weapons capacity. Ayatollah Khamenei and his subordinates contend that Iran is enriching uranium to produce energy and for medical purposes, and that sanctions are a form of economic warfare.
But it was not until Wednesday that he expressed an opinion about the Oct. 3 confrontation in Tehran between the police and Iranians trying to sell rials to black-market money traders for dollars and other foreign currencies. The panicky selling had been one of the most visible signs of worsening inflation and a lack of economic confidence.
The ensuing violence was said to lead to at least two dozen arrests and galvanized thousands to march to the capital's politically influential Grand Bazaar. Many of the merchants there closed for the day to express their anger over the rial's plummeting value.
The protest over the rial crisis was widely interpreted in the United States and Europe as signaling a profound new problem for the Iranian leadership, which has since cracked down on foreign-exchange speculators but does not appear to have a longer-term solution.
Ayatollah Khamenei said the protest was nothing more than a pretext to disturb the peace. ''For about two or three hours, a number of people set some garbage cans on fire on two Tehran streets, and immediately officials of certain countries flouted diplomatic protocol and childishly expressed delight,'' he said.
Addressing Western countries, he said, ''Your problems are much more complicated than Iran's problems because your economy has stagnated.''
He dismissed Western leaders' suggestion that the sanctions would be eased if Iran agreed to suspend its uranium enrichment. ''Now they claim that if the Iranian nation ignores its nuclear energy, the sanctions will be lifted,'' he said. ''They are telling a lie. They make decisions against the Iranian nation due to their long-cherished hostility.''

HEADLINE: The Wrong Way to Help the Poor

BYLINE: By GARY E. MacDOUGAL. 
Gary E. MacDougal, a former business consultant and executive, advised Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois, a Republican, on welfare reform and is the author of ''Make a Difference: A Spectacular Breakthrough in the Fight Against Poverty.''

 BODY:
Chicago
THIS evening, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Representative Paul D. Ryan will meet in their only vice-presidential debate. Without a doubt they'll square off on jobs, taxes and Medicare. But in all likelihood, one key issue will be lucky to merit even a passing remark from either side -- the question of how to lift 46 million Americans out of poverty. It's an issue crying out for serious debate.
Each year, American taxpayers spend nearly $1 trillion trying to help the poor, according to a recent study by the Cato Institute. It's easy to miss that headline number, though, because the money flows into and out of scores of federal, state and local government programs. In April, Michael D. Tanner, a senior fellow at Cato, a libertarian research group, compiled a list of 126 federal programs for low-income Americans, which together spend $668 billion of taxpayer money annually. State and local governments allocate an additional $284 billion, he estimated. 
To be sure, some of these programs, though focused on low-income Americans, extend a hand to more than just ''the poor.'' Roughly a quarter of this trillion-dollar outlay is devoted to Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for poor and disabled people, including many elderly. Other programs have a broader impact on society as well. One might argue, for example, that Pell grants, which make it easier for 10 million young men and women to go to college, are more focused on promoting education than stemming poverty.
But for now, let's use that $1 trillion figure to ask a broader question: Are we spending this money in truly the best way to help the poor?
Consider a thought experiment: Divide $1 trillion by 46 million and you get around $21,700 for each American in poverty, or nearly $87,000 for a family of four. That's almost four times the $23,050 per year federal poverty line for that family. It's intriguing to think about converting all of this to a cash payment that would instantly lift everyone in poverty up to the middle class.
For a variety of reasons, of course, that's not possible, either logistically or politically. But a middle path might resemble what Mr. Ryan has proposed for Medicaid -- converting the behemoth program to block grants for each state, an idea that in some ways parallels the successful welfare reform plan of the Clinton era.
Most Americans agree that it's in all of our interest, for both humane and economic reasons, to help people move from dependency to self-sufficiency. The challenge is how to do it effectively while minimizing waste. Currently, our various antipoverty efforts are both fragmented and overlapping.
A study by the Institute for Educational Leadership, for example, identified 7 Senate committees and subcommittees, 11 House committees and subcommittees, 7 cabinet departments and 8 other agencies that had a hand in overseeing one antipoverty program or another. The authors described a typical family eligible for 20 separate programs, each with its own set of complex eligibility forms and often managed by separate government offices.
While some fragmentation for special needs is desirable, and room should be provided for flexibility, it's clear that our scattershot efforts are hobbled by bureaucracy and duplication, even as they let too many needy people slip through the cracks. The help most families need should be provided with a holistic one-stop approach at the local level. For example, if an element like transportation, job placement, child care or substance-abuse treatment is missing, much of the rest of the taxpayer investment is often wasted.
Another factor is the natural reluctance of advocates, Congressional staffers, think tanks and providers of services for the poor to see their favorite programs cut or consolidated. Few are willing to give up authority over their piece of the program pie.
Even without converting all of our federal antipoverty dollars to state block grants, however, we can still do more to combat this fragmentation and zealous protection of fiefs. We can start by measuring outcomes (results) rather than inputs (how much money can we throw at the problem). Our effectiveness should be assessed, in part, by the per-person cost of moving individuals from dependency to self-sufficiency.
Most Americans understand that people enter poverty for many reasons and that we have an obligation to help them get out of it. A ''conservative'' path of just slashing budgets isn't going to meet that obligation, but neither is the ''liberal'' path of embracing every program and spending more on each. We need a third way. The changes to spending on human services and Medicaid in Mr. Ryan's budget proposal, if not a perfect template, could be a catalyst for starting the conversation. If only it would come up at tonight's debate.

HEADLINE: Romney Given Better Grades On Leadership

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN; Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Megan Thee-Brenan from New York. Allison Kopicki and Marina Stefan contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney is seen by more voters in three battleground states as a strong leader after his dominant debate performance last week, but perceptions that the economy is improving remain a buttress for President Obama as the 2012 campaign comes down to its final weeks.
The latest Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News poll, of likely voters in the three states, Colorado, Virginia and Wisconsin, found no sharp movement after the debate and the news last Friday that the unemployment rate in September had dropped below 8 percent for the first time since Mr. Obama took office.
But the poll suggested that Mr. Romney had gained strength in a number of ways since last month and that Mr. Obama's best defense is the somewhat brighter economic outlook and the fact that voters continue to relate to him more than they do to his opponent.
Mr. Romney's backers now support him more fervently than before. He is running stronger in particular among those who say they are paying especially close attention to the race. He retains his dominance on the issue of handling the federal budget deficit and seems to have stabilized his showing on handling of the economy. 
About two-thirds of the voters in each state said Mr. Romney has strong leadership qualities, more than said the same of the president.
''The debate made me feel better about'' Mr. Romney, one poll respondent, Paula Gregory, 37, a clerical manager for a construction firm who lives in Highlands Ranch, Colo., said in a follow-up interview. ''I had more specific information from him and he had real rebuttals to accusations that had been made, most specifically about his tax plan.''
But Mr. Obama holds a slim advantage in Virginia and Wisconsin, and remains tied with Mr. Romney in Colorado, perhaps, in part, because voters are growing increasingly hopeful that the country's economy is turning around. That conclusion follows last Friday's report showing the unemployment rate falling to 7.8 percent, the first dip below 8 percent since January 2009. In Virginia, 42 percent of voters say the economy is getting better, up from 24 percent in July; in Colorado the figure is 37 percent, up 11 points in three months.
The positive economic news appears to have buffered the president in Virginia, Wisconsin and Colorado from the substantial improvement in Mr. Romney's national poll numbers over the past week. The three battleground polls suggest that challenges remain for Mr. Romney in the next 26 days even as his supporters express new confidence about their candidate.
''It's slow and steady, but the job market is growing,'' Thomas Broderick, 50, a doctor from Madison, Wis., said in a follow-up interview. ''Also, from what I see around my city, the housing market is better. People are able to sell their homes. Houses are being built. If the economy were in the tank, perhaps it would be harder to vote for Obama.''
In Virginia and Wisconsin, Mr. Obama maintains double-digit leads over his rival when voters are asked which candidate cares about their needs and who would do a better job for the middle class. The preference for Mr. Obama on those issues is smaller in Colorado, a state where the two candidates have been virtually tied for months.
The president's support is built on strengths that have been evident for months. In the two states where he holds an advantage overall, Mr. Obama has consistently outperformed Mr. Romney on a series of issues, including international affairs, health care and Medicare.
And in those states, Mr. Obama's months of advertising attacking Mr. Romney's character appears to have worked. The president maintains significant leads over Mr. Romney on the issue of trust and honesty. Nearly 60 percent of voters in Virginia and Wisconsin say Mr. Obama is trustworthy and honest; just 47 percent say the same of Mr. Romney.
Suzanne DiLisi, 44, a restaurant worker from Marshall, Va., said Wednesday that she planned to vote for Mr. Obama because of concerns that Mr. Romney would not help lower-income people like herself.
''Financially speaking, I believe Romney will cut the debt,'' Ms. DiLisi said. ''But he will do it at the expense of people who are already suffering.'' She pointed to Mr. Romney's comment that 47 percent of Americans are dependent on government.
''Those remarks, they were awful,'' she said. ''As president, you literally have to work for the very poor to the very rich.''
The New York Times, in collaboration with Quinnipiac University and CBS News, is tracking the presidential race with recurring polls in six states. The current surveys, which have margins of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for each candidate, were conducted from Oct. 4 to Oct. 9, after the debate in Denver.
Officials with both campaigns expressed confidence about success in Virginia and Wisconsin. Mr. Romney's campaign hopes that his selection of Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate will help him in a state that Mr. Obama won decisively in 2008. In Virginia, Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney have each fielded intensive on-the-ground operations and millions of dollars in ads.
Mr. Romney's campaign is targeting the state's traditionally Democratic coal country, its military-heavy communities of Virginia Beach and Newport News, and Asian population centers in Northern Virginia, officials at the campaign said.
''There's no area of Virginia that's off the table,'' said Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, who won three years ago by earning support in those same parts of the state. ''Overwhelmingly in Virginia, it's jobs and spending. I think that Mitt Romney's message works everywhere.''
Mr. Obama's campaign strategists said the president was working hard to repeat his 2008 victory in the state. He has visited Virginia 44 times since becoming president, officials said.
''It was always going to be close,'' said Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia. He said fund-raising and enthusiasm had actually picked up since Mr. Obama's disappointing debate performance. ''It helped Romney. But there's a counter-reaction, too. And it's not deflation. It's a call to arms.''
The picture is a bit different in Colorado, where support for the two candidates is evenly divided across a broad series of issues. Mr. Romney fares better in Colorado among women than he does in the other two states.
''We are basically sitting at a statistical tie today,'' said James Garcia, Mr. Romney's state director in Colorado. But he said enthusiasm for Mr. Romney had surged since the debate, in Denver. ''Volunteer enthusiasm is through the roof. ''
The new polling in Colorado backs that up. Six out of 10 Romney voters in the state now say they are strongly favoring him rather than offering lukewarm support or just opposing Mr. Obama. Earlier this summer, just over half of his voters said that.

HEADLINE: Romney Campaign Looks to Capitalize on Image Voters Saw in Debate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and ASHLEY PARKER; Jeff Zeleny contributed from reporting from Sidney, Ohio.

 BODY:
BOSTON -- Inside Mitt Romney's campaign headquarters over the past few days, the data pouring in was unmistakable. Aides scouring the results of focus groups and national polls found that undecided voters watching the presidential debate in Denver seemed startled when the Republican candidate portrayed all year by Democrats -- the ultraconservative, unfeeling capitalist -- did not materialize.
The voters, they discovered, consistently reserved their highest marks for moments when Mr. Romney sounded bipartisan and moderate, two themes he has long played down on the campaign trail but seemed to take pains to showcase this week with centrist-sounding statements on taxes, abortion and immigration.
But the appearance at this late stage of a modulating Mitt Romney risks reopening a long-running debate about his authenticity, given that he has described himself as ''severely conservative,'' dismissed 47 percent of voters as government dependent, and picked a bold conservative as his running mate. 
Behind the new efforts by the Romney campaign to soften his conservative edges and showcase his personal story was a realization by his political team -- borne out by reactions to his performance at the debate -- that with the economy showing improvement their best shot at victory is to aggressively defy the negative perceptions that have dogged him throughout the race.
In interviews, those advisers described a strategy to capitalize on Mr. Romney's upswing in the final stretch by highlighting his record of bipartisanship, his time as governor of Massachusetts and history of personal generosity -- relying on television advertising, appearances by high-profile supporters and speeches by the candidate himself.
Russ Schriefer, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, said that four years ago Obama voters ''liked the idea of him being a bipartisan president.''
''And just because they've given up on him,'' he said, ''they haven't given up on the idea of someone being bipartisan and working across the aisle to get things done.''
How aggressively the campaign will pursue this approach on the campaign trail and over the airwaves is an open question. Since the debate, Mr. Romney has not entirely remade his stump speech to emphasize those messages. And the commercials released by the campaign on Wednesday focused on the economy, not bipartisanship as governor -- a notion that some Massachusetts lawmakers hotly dispute.
What they are envisioning represents a high-stakes wager that voters can be persuaded by a version of Mr. Romney that they have scarcely seen -- a version that is, in many ways, at odds with how Mr. Romney campaigned throughout the Republican primary season, when he emphasized his conservatism on social and economic issues.
The perils of such a shift became evident on Wednesday when conservatives expressed wariness about remarks in which Mr. Romney seemed to again muddle his position on abortion. In an interview with the editorial board of The Des Moines Register, which has supported abortion rights and usually endorses Democrats in general elections, Mr. Romney said, ''There's no legislation with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda.''
Steve Deace, a conservative radio host in Iowa, told listeners on Wednesday, ''I'm running out of fingers and toes to count the number of positions he has taken on abortion.''
The Obama campaign pounced. It accused Mr. Romney, who has previously said he would like to see the Supreme Court overturn the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, of ''cynically and dishonestly'' misleading voters about his views on abortion.
Mr. Romney's aides said he was responding to a specific question about his agenda in Congress, not a broader inquiry about abortion. Even so, they felt compelled to quickly assure religious conservatives that his position had not changed, reaching out to leaders like Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, an advocacy group that vigorously opposes abortion.
By Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Romney told reporters after a campaign event in Ohio: ''I'm a pro-life candidate. I'll be a pro-life president.''
Mr. Romney set off similar confusion last week when he declared that he would not cancel two-year deportation deferrals for illegal immigrants granted by the Obama administration, a position that distanced him from conservative orthodoxy.
But a few days later, his campaign clarified that Mr. Romney intended to halt the program after he took office and would not issue any new deferrals.
The changes are sometimes subtle. Mr. Romney, who has long extolled the virtues of two-parent families, offered words of praise for single mothers at a rally in Ohio on Wednesday, including them in a list of people ''who live for things bigger than ourselves.''
The Romney campaign, which once winced at the mere suggestion that he had changed a position and hounded journalists who used the word ''flip-flop,'' seemed largely unbothered by claims that he is reorienting himself for a general election audience.
''Those concerns have receded,'' said Gary Marx, executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and a former Romney counselor on conservative issues. ''He is being intentional about reaching out to a broader cross-section of voters on these issues.''
He added: ''He is delivering multiple messages to different groups. That is a sophisticated campaign at work late in the game.''
The strategy is both a reaction to a changing campaign landscape and the fruit of long-running internal debates over how to sell Mr. Romney to a sometimes skeptical electorate. After a year of focusing relentlessly on President's Obama's stewardship of the economy, and resisting pressure to offer a three-dimensional portrait of Mr. Romney as a father, husband, businessman and governor, the campaign realized that it needed to switch gears.
The Obama campaign had filled the void through advertising and news releases, leaving many voters with strongly negative views of Mr. Romney by the time he became the Republican nominee.
The new approach was trotted out haltingly at first and was overwhelmed for a time by a leaked video of Mr. Romney talking about ''47 percent'' of voters who do not pay taxes. But it finally seemed to break through during the first presidential debate.
Republican political operatives said there was already proof in the polls that playing up Mr. Romney's inclination toward pragmatism and problem-solving is resonating with voters.
''Barack Obama has been out there for months saying that Mitt Romney is this scary beast that will eat your children and throw Grandma out in the snow,'' said Alex Castellanos, a veteran Republican operative who worked for Mr. Romney in 2008 but is not aligned with any candidate this year. ''And all of a sudden this very practical businessman showed up in the debates, and he's just not the guy Obama has been painting.''

HEADLINE: A Republican Haven Is Finding Itself Split

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Allison Kopicki contributed to this story from New York.

 BODY:
PEWAUKEE, Wis. -- In the battle for control of the Senate, this state would seem to have everything Republicans could dream of: a shift to red up and down the ballot in 2010, a Republican governor who decisively survived a recall effort a few months ago, and a local son turned vice-presidential nominee.
Yet with Election Day fast approaching, Representative Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat who has been rated among the most liberal members of Congress, finds herself about even in the polls with the Republican candidate, former Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, who once ran for president, and who not long ago was widely presumed to walk away with the open Senate seat here.
Even Ms. Baldwin acknowledged the other day that she had been taken by surprise -- ''I pinched myself and said, 'What?' '' -- when polls began tipping her way. But the election here is a reminder that advertising matters (no matter how much voters complain about it), that people make choices on individual candidates (not only party ideology), and perhaps most of all, that Wisconsin, like some of the other Midwestern states that moved toward the Republicans in 2010, may remain relatively evenly split along partisan lines. 
''That's where we're really misunderstood,'' said Jef Hall, Winnebago County's Democratic Party chairman, pointing to his county seat, Oshkosh, among a long list of communities that can be tipped. ''When it comes down to it, we're really a 50-50 city in a 50-50 county in a 50-50 state.''
The race for the seat being vacated by longtime Senator Herb Kohl, a Democrat, (''Tammy versus Tommy,'' in the shorthand of Wisconsin) offers nothing if not striking distinctions.
Ms. Baldwin is a strong backer of President Obama's policies, while Mr. Thompson, who served as health and human services secretary under President George W. Bush, denounces the new health care law and warns that the country is sliding miserably toward disaster.
Ms. Baldwin, 50, who would be the first female senator from Wisconsin and the first openly gay senator, won her first election to Congress in 1998, the last year that Mr. Thompson, who was elected to four terms as governor, appeared on the ballot in Wisconsin.
Ms. Baldwin is soft-spoken to the point that listeners must actually lean in at times to hear her. Mr. Thompson, 70, on a recent evening stood before a crowd in this Milwaukee suburb at an annual event known as ''Grazing With the Elephants'' pounding on a lectern, roaring ''Isn't it great to be a Republican?'' and, threatening to drop to the ground to do push-ups.
A Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News poll of likely voters in Wisconsin, conducted in the last week, showed Ms. Baldwin favored by 48 percent of those polled compared with 46 percent for Mr. Thompson, a difference that falls within the margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The results are a switch from August, when polls showed Mr. Thompson ahead. That was the month he emerged from a fierce, crowded and costly Republican primary with about 34 percent of the vote -- and a debt of about $600,000, he said. Ms. Baldwin had no primary challenger, so while the Thompson campaign tried to refill its coffers, her campaign was quickly able to run a series of mostly unanswered television ads.
''It's like standing in a boxing match with your hands tied behind you, and just getting slugged until they get tired of hitting you,'' Mr. Thompson said in a recent interview. ''Even Vince Lombardi, after four weeks of that kind of barrage, would have weakened,'' he continued.
Beneath all of this is the question of where Wisconsin, arguably the most politically volatile state in recent years, stands now.
While the new poll said that Mr. Obama has a narrow edge in the state, Republicans here note that he and his surrogates have traveled to Wisconsin lately. They argue that while Democrats have won the presidential contest here since 1988, Representative Paul D. Ryan's presence on the Republican ticket makes a difference. ''He's our rock star: so genuine and so darn nice,'' said Mike Herl, chairman of the Dane County Republican Party.
But others say that Wisconsin voters have always been split and always will be, and that a vote in June to turn back a recall effort against Gov. Scott Walker was less a sign of Republicans' dominance in the state than of ''disquiet,'' in the words of Dick Pas, the Democratic chairman in Waukesha County, with the broad notion of recall.
The back-and-forth of the ads in the Senate race has grown overwhelming, voters here say, with anti-Thompson ads portraying him as a politician from another era who has abandoned Wisconsin for Washington and anti-Baldwin ads portraying her as more left-leaning than Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader.
As of July, when federal financial reports were last filed, Ms. Baldwin's campaign had raised about $7 million compared with about $2.5 million by Mr. Thompson's campaign, but spending by outside groups on both sides has been still larger.
Mr. Thompson, usually gregarious, sounds anything but upbeat as he talks about his reason for running now. Is he having fun? No, he says twice. ''I don't need this,'' he said.
''The only reason I'm running is because I want to keep this country fiscally sound,'' he continued, beginning a bleak description of the economic crisis ahead without an end to partisan gridlock in Washington.
Ms. Baldwin's sexual orientation has barely been mentioned along the campaign trail by either side. ''There are reasons for both campaigns to leave the issue alone -- somewhat out of uncertainty,'' said Charles Franklin, a political scientist whose Marquette Law School polling has suggested growing support on issues like same-sex marriage in Wisconsin, a state that in 2006 passed an amendment limiting marriage to a man and a woman.
At one point, a campaign adviser to Mr. Thompson sent out an e-mail including a link to a video of Ms. Baldwin dancing during a gay pride event in Madison. Mr. Thompson later told reporters that his aide had erred in sending the e-mail and that sexual orientation was not an issue in the election.
Ms. Baldwin has drawn support from groups like LPAC, a lesbian ''super PAC,'' but she also says that matters like how to get ahead and how to get a job are what voters care about most.
Still, Ms. Baldwin recalled a formative moment of her own, watching a tiny television from an efficiency apartment in 1984 as Geraldine A. Ferraro received the vice-presidential nomination, the first woman to do so for a major party. ''The firsts also send a strong message,'' she said, ''to those who may think, 'Can I do anything I want?' ''

HEADLINE: Russia Won't Renew Pact On Weapons With U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- The Russian government said Wednesday that it would not renew a hugely successful 20-year partnership with the United States to safeguard and dismantle nuclear and chemical weapons in the former Soviet Union when the program expires next spring, a potentially grave setback in the already fraying relationship between the former cold war enemies.
The Kremlin's refusal to renew the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program would put an end to a multibillion-dollar effort, financed largely by American taxpayers, that is widely credited with removing all nuclear weapons from the former Soviet republics of Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus; deactivating more than 7,600 strategic nuclear warheads; and eliminating huge stockpiles of nuclear missiles and chemical weapons, as well as launchers and other equipment and military sites that supported unconventional weapons. 
''The American side knows that we would not want a new extension,'' a deputy foreign minister, Sergey Ryabkov, told the news agency Interfax. ''This is not news.''
In a statement on its Web site, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that the Obama administration had proposed renewing the arrangement but that Washington was well aware of Russia's opposition. ''American partners know that their proposal is not consistent with our ideas about what forms and on what basis further cooperation should be built,'' the statement said.
Russian officials, meanwhile, noted that their country's financial situation is far improved from the days after the collapse of the Soviet Union, raising the possibility that Russia would be willing to continue initiatives started under the Nunn-Lugar agreement, but with its own financing and supervision. The Foreign Ministry, in its statement, noted that Russia has increased its budget allocation ''in the field of disarmament.''
American officials, including one of the original architects of the program, Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, have said they still have hope of reaching some form of new agreement with Russia.
But the prospects seem bleak.
President Vladimir V. Putin, while expressing a willingness to cooperate on nonproliferation issues, has said that a more pressing priority is to address Russia's opposition to United States plans for a missile defense system based in Europe. President Obama has shown little willingness to make any concessions, other than to offer repeated reassurance that the system is not intended for use against Russia. And the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, seems even less likely to compromise on the missile defense issue.
The plan to end the Nunn-Lugar program appears to be the latest step by the Russian government in an expanding effort to curtail American-led initiatives, and especially the influence of American money, in various spheres of Russian public policy.
Last month, the Kremlin directed the United States Agency for International Development to halt all of its operations in Russia, which similarly entailed two decades of work, but in support of nonprofit groups like human rights advocates and civil society and public health programs.
The Russian government had made no secret of its unhappiness with some programs financed by the Agency for International Development, like Golos, the country's only independent election-monitoring group, which helped expose fraud in disputed parliamentary voting last December.
Mr. Lugar, who is leaving the Senate at the end of this year, visited Moscow in August to begin pressing for renewal of the program and found Russian officials resistant. ''The Russian government indicated a desire to make changes to the Nunn-Lugar Umbrella Agreement as opposed to simply extending it,'' he said Wednesday. ''At no time did officials indicate that, at this stage of negotiation, they were intent on ending it, only amending it.''
But Mr. Lugar, the senior Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, lost a primary election this year in his bid for a seventh term, and he has acknowledged that there are few lawmakers who seem willing to carry on his efforts, which began in partnership with Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia.
During his August visit to Moscow, Mr. Lugar said he hoped that the United States and Russia could use their past successes as a basis for expanding their efforts to reduce the threat of unconventional weapons in other countries. He raised the idea of trying to eliminate chemical weapons in Syria.
Russian officials, however, seem increasingly unwilling to let the United States set the agenda in global diplomacy -- blocking demands, for example, for more aggressive intervention in Syria.

HEADLINE: The IMF and the GOP

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Even more wrong that we thought. 

 BODY:
Econowonks are still buzzing about the new IMF World Economic Outlook, which offered grim warnings about the world economy, and also argued forcefully if discreetly that a big reason for the worsening outlook is that policy makers have gotten the basic economics wrong.
Of particular interest is the discussion in Chapter 1 (pdf) on fiscal multipliers. I and others have been arguing for a while that the experience of austerity in the eurozone clearly suggests pretty big Keynesian effects. Here, for example, is what a scatterplot of fiscal consolidation (from the IMF Fiscal Monitor) and growth (including an estimate for next year, from the World Economic Outlook) looks like:
But, you might object, maybe the causation runs the other way; maybe countries in trouble are forced into fiscal consolidation, so it's not the austerity what did it. But the IMF has an answer to that: it looks at forecast errors versus austerity. Part of the reason for doing this is to figure out why things are going so much worse than expected; but there's also the fact that the forecasts already included the known problems of the economies in question, so that you're more or less getting an estimate of the impact of austerity over and above the known problems (and the initially assumed effect of austerity, which was supposed to be small). It looks like this:
As it says, this indicates that the contractionary effects of fiscal consolidation are substantially bigger than policy makers were assuming.
So one thing I haven't seen pointed out is that this directly contradicts current GOP doctrine. To the extent that the GOP has a theory of recession-fighting, other than the view that the animal spirits of job creators will soar once that evil Obama is gone, it was embodied in the Joint Economic Committee manifesto Spend Less, Owe Less, Grow the Economy (pdf), which declared that
In the short term, fiscal consolidation programs that rely predominately or entirely on spending reductions have expansionary "non-Keynesian" effects that may offset the contractionary Keynesian reduction in aggregate demand.
-
In some cases, "non-Keynesian" effects may be strong enough to make fiscal consolidation programs expansionary in the short term.
Tell that to the Greeks.
The reality is that everything that has happened economically since the turn away from stimulus to austerity, from interest rates to inflation to output, has refuted the doctrine the GOP is pushing. Since there has of course been no concession of error, this does not bode well for the US economy if Romney wins.

HEADLINE: Collectively Photographing Fracking

BYLINE: JESSE NEWMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Marcellus Shale Documentary Project, a collective of photographers who are documenting fracking in places like rural Pennsylvania, confront a difficult question: how do you photograph something that's invisible? 

 BODY:
The most basic thing that photography does is visually describe what can be seen. The problem facing photographers of the Marcellus Shale Documentary Project is that what they wish to describe cannot be seen - an invisible gas buried deep underground. They have struggled to document the effect of the natural gas drilling commonly known as fracking.
By now most Americans are familiar with the suggestive-sounding colloquialism; in states like Pennsylvania, which sit above shale rock formations awash in natural gas, the word resonates deeply. It is shorthand for hydraulic fracturing, and an abridged reference to the latest chapter in American resource extraction. Depending on whom you talk to, the word can signal the promise of new life (to a struggling dairy farmer, perhaps) or environmental destruction (to custodians of the state's watershed).
For those still vague on the details of what fracking actually means, it is a process of natural gas drilling in which millions of gallons of water, sand and chemicals, some of them toxic, are pumped below ground to break up rock and release bubbles of gas stored inside. Since drilling began in the Marcellus Shale - a gas-rich rock formation that runs along the Appalachian Mountains from West Virginia to New York State - energy companies have taken vast quantities of natural gas from the earth and piped it to consumers, promoting it as clean domestic energy which can help wean America off foreign oil. In the meantime, growing complaints of water contamination around the United States have led to concerns that hydraulic fracturing poses grave risks to the health of humans and the environment.
Amid the noise on either side of the debate over drilling, members of the Marcellus Shale Documentary Project have been quietly canvassing the Pennsylvania countryside to document the people and places caught up in the state's gas boom. Brian Cohen, the project's director, said he liked to think of the group as something like a modern-day Farm Security Administration. Together, the six photographers have been able to do what no one of them could do alone: crisscross the state, photograph dozens of drill rigs that have popped up along highways and in backyards, and talk to farmers, homeowners, drillers, environmental advocates and lawyers, all of whom have a profound stake in the invisible substance buried more than a mile below ground. Ultimately, their aim is to create a visual record of the "great shale rush," and chronicle the changes that Americans can expect to see as we drill our way into the future.
The group's photographs depict a heavy industrial process scattered across a rural landscape: amid miles of lush green forest or farmland, suddenly there is a shaved patch. Atop the clearing is a battery of drilling equipment: a tall derrick, bright klieg lights and lined troughs full of chemical wastewater. In some photographs, a long, steel pipeline snakes through the frame. In others, the flare from a drill rig lights the night sky. There are pictures of people, too: farmers who leased their land for drilling, homeowners with enough methane in their groundwater to light a tap on fire; and here and there, an industry employee.
Because of its scope, the Marcellus Shale Documentary Project offers an in-depth look at the transformations taking place across rural Pennsylvania, where thousands of wells have been drilled in recent years, and more are planned. To be sure, photographers said, the shale gas boom has provided a jolt to the local economy of struggling towns, and many residents are benefiting - directly or indirectly - from the new income and business. But there are environmental hazards, of course, and residents are also coping with the unexpected side effects of rapid industrialization. Downtown streets are choked with traffic, local services are straining to accommodate thousands of workers who have arrived from out of state, and the influx of drillers has created housing crises in some places. There are rifts between residents with different views on fracking, and tension between locals and drillers, who hail largely from states in the South.
Each of the photographers - Mr. Cohen, Noah Addis, Nina Berman, Scott Goldsmith, Lynn Johnson and Martha Rial - brings a distinct style and sensibility to the issue of natural gas drilling. Many of Mr. Cohen's photographs, for example, are panoramic landscapes in which the drill rigs tend to be small. Their diminutive size is paradoxical, of course, given the immensity of the work they do, and their potential impact on American energy, the economy and the surrounding ecosystem.
As Mr. Cohen explained, "It's hard to figure out how to communicate that there is something going on that could have repercussions but that doesn't seem, on the surface, to be having much of an imprint."
A similar artistic challenge motivated Ms. Berman, who said she was drawn to projects that stir up contradictory feelings. Driving around northeastern Pennsylvania, especially at night, she felt both spooked by and attracted to the landscape. "The place took on a different feel that was simultaneously very creepy and seductive," Ms. Berman said. Over time, she began to see her divergent reactions as a metaphor for the entire project of shale gas drilling. On one hand, there is the lure of fast, easy money, she said. On the other, is the darker side, the contamination of Pennsylvania's aquifers.
"I want people to consider that feeling," Ms. Berman said. "The feeling of being seduced by something that may not necessarily be in your best interest. Or may be in your best interest, it depends."
For her part, Ms. Johnson used two different visual styles to make two separate sets of pictures. Her black and white photographs, shot in traditional photojournalistic style, focus on the daily lives of residents and environmental activists. But as she traveled across Pennsylvania, Ms. Johnson also began taking pictures with her iPhone. The result is a series of small photographs that are colorful, electric and spur of the moment. Viewed in quick succession, they seem like simple sketches, or impressions, of a complex time and place. 
According to Ms. Johnson, one of the most troubling aspects of the controversy over natural gas drilling is how it has torn at the social fabric of small communities. It is not just a question of toxicity in the land, she said, but of poisoned personal relationships. "The presence of drilling corrupts everyone on both sides," Ms. Johnson said. "It has drawn battle lines in communities. Families are pitted against families, neighbor against neighbor, mother against son." But allies have been created of people who might otherwise have had little in common.
The thing about hydraulic fracturing, said members of the Marcellus Shale Documentary Project, is that even after you make sense of its complex science and divisive politics, it still isn't easy to photograph. First, there is the invisibility of the stuff itself. "We're talking about things like air and water," Mr. Cohen said. "These are the two central issues in this story, and they're very ethereal and hard to grasp."
Second, there is the issue of access, to the gas industry and homeowners who have assented - or declined - to lease land to the companies. In an effort to portray the process fairly, Mr. Cohen said, photographers in the group repeatedly sought cooperation from drilling companies. "We've made a tremendous effort not to be purely ideological about it," he said. "But we've gotten almost nothing back. It's been like banging our heads against the wall." 
People whose water supply has been contaminated are more readily available, Mr. Cohen said, but even they can fear being photographed. "A lot of people are very shy of being exposed," he said. "There's a lot of stuff that doesn't make it onto camera because people are frightened. They are very, very intimidated."
Many people who have challenged a gas company in court are prohibited from speaking to the media via nondisclosure agreements, Ms. Berman said. In other cases, it can be difficult to verify the facts when someone claims their well water has gone bad. But Ms. Berman said she thought the dearth of compelling photographs about hydraulic fracturing went beyond the question of access. Environmental issues can be difficult subject matter for photojournalists, she said. "It can be hard to get into a landscape if you're used to photographing people and very active situations."
What's more, many activists post their own pictures online, which Ms. Berman said could sometimes deter professionals. Finally, the recent documentary film "Gasland" had a big effect on the still images that followed it. Many photographers thought the picture to get was the exploding faucet, she said. They thought this is a story "with gotcha pictures." But the drill rigs, pipelines and faucets on fire are only part of the story, Mr. Cohen said. Visually, they are compelling, important pictures. "But that's the sensational stuff," he said. "Once you get past that, there are real things that are happening to real people, that, if you focus merely on the stuff, you are going to miss."
Despite the challenges, photographs taken by the Marcellus Shale Documentary Project make up an absorbing account of the drilling frenzy in America. Looking at them, it is hard not to recall the last energy boom in Pennsylvania, when anthracite coal mines collected near the Susquehanna River. No doubt things have changed in the past century; today there are brine pits instead of culm banks and gas compressor stations in lieu of coal breakers. River barges and trains are also a thing of the past; these days, tanker trucks marked "residual waste" tear up and down winding two-lane highways instead.
Any number of these highways will take you to Pittsburgh, where an exhibition of the Marcellus Shale Documentary Project's photographs opens Thursday night at Pittsburgh Filmmakers Galleries. Just please be careful driving.

HEADLINE: How to Read Like a Magazine Designer

BYLINE: DREA ZLANABITNIG


HIGHLIGHT: My nerdy West Wing-related read and my favorite books about grids and typography. 

 BODY:
 Drea Zlanabitnig is a designer at the magazine. 
 Book I'm reading now: 
One book I am currently reading is "The Prime-Time Presidency: 'The West Wing' and U.S. Nationalism," which invokes the presidency as a symbol of American nationalism, and illustrates certain themes and narratives with scenes from the TV show (I've seen each episode at least nine times). It is a totally nerdy book to read, but it is really well written and seems fitting in today's political climate, which is completely engulfed by popular culture. I am also reading Walter Benjamin's "Illuminations: Essays and Reflections."
 Last book I loved: 
"Pulphead: Essays," by John Jeremiah Sullivan. I love when he writes for our magazine, so it was a real treat to read essays on a variety of topics and to see America through his eyes.
 Unread book on my bedside table that gnaws at my conscience: 
Proust's "In Search of Lost Time, Vol. 1: Swann's Way." I feel like I owe it to myself to read this series - or at least the first volume - but its sheer size stops me from picking it up once I crawl into bed.
 Three books in my field that I highly recommend: 
"Grid Systems in Graphic Design," by Josef Müller-Brockmann. A clear guide to what a grid is and how to use it. Especially when doing editorial design, a good understanding of the grid (and when to break it) is very useful. There are many books on the grid, but I found this one to be the most helpful and straightforward.
"The Photograph as Contemporary Art," by Charlotte Cotton. This book beautifully summarizes the history of contemporary photography and shows one photo from each artist Cotton writes about. It is the perfect starting point if you're interested in learning about photography.
"The Elements of Typographic Style," by Robert Bringhurst. This is the ultimate guide on typesetting and all things related to typography. It is both an interesting read and something to keep next to your computer for reference.
 One book I would recommend to anyone: 
"On Photography," by Susan Sontag. As photography has become such a ubiquitous part of modern life, it's refreshing to read Sontag's analysis of the medium.

HEADLINE: How the South Lost the Bluegrass State

BYLINE: AARON ASTOR


HIGHLIGHT: The Confederates had a chance to take Kentucky. They blew it. 

 BODY:
As John Hunt Morgan's cavalry dashed across central Kentucky in July 1862, this scion of the Bluegrass, the man known as the Thunderbolt of the Confederacy, promised local citizens that he would respect their private property and target only the Federal military supply lines and depots guarded by poorly trained Home Guard units. 
If the Paris, Ky., Western Citizen newspaper is any guide, Morgan failed to keep up his end of the bargain: "Did Morgan keep his word to protect private property? Pshaw, not he! Four thousand dollars would not pay the amount of his stealing, in horse, buggies, etc. Not a Union man within his reach escaped him." Even more egregious a crime, in the minds of Kentucky Unionists in the tense late summer of 1862, was the command to use only Confederate dollars - mere scrip, as locals put it - despite the inflated value of Southern currency. A landowner in Lexington complained that Morgan's men offered to "pay" civilians for his loot with Confederate currency, thus adding insult to injury.
Though the Confederate Army launched a bold and potentially decisive invasion of Unionist Kentucky in the summer of 1862, its leaders discovered by early October 1862 that citizens of even the state's most pro-Southern sections, like the Bluegrass region around Lexington, viewed the Confederates not as liberators but as rascally and illegitimate invaders to be treated with contempt. 
When local citizens refused to embrace the feeble Confederate economy as their own, the rebel officers imposed it on them. Kentucky civilians responded to Confederate General Braxton Bragg's call for tens of thousands of volunteers with numbers in the mere hundreds. Despite threatening Louisville and Cincinnati, occupying Lexington and even installing a Confederate governor in command, the great Southern invasion of Kentucky in 1862 produced nothing more than a few wagons, horses, guns and barrels of whiskey. The great Kentucky gamble failed and the state would remain in Union hands for the rest of the war. To a great extent, the Confederates had only themselves to blame.
In retrospect, it is remarkable how quickly the Confederate Army had turned the military tide in the Western theater in the summer of 1862. After a string of humiliating defeats beginning with Mill Springs in eastern Kentucky and Fort Donelson along the Tennessee-Kentucky border, the Confederate Army found itself pressed deep into Mississippi with its highest-ranking general, Albert Sidney Johnston, killed at the decisive Battle of Shiloh. The Union army successfully occupied Middle and West Tennessee, controlled the railroad crossing at Corinth, Miss., and prepared itself for a grand push down the Mississippi River. 
But a change in command in the Confederate Army in the West placed the harsh and still-respected Braxton Bragg in charge of the main force, and he quickly moved his supply train east to Chattanooga. In Knoxville, Edmund Kirby Smith took command of a smaller but equally vital Confederate force. Bragg and Smith planned a daring two-pronged movement across Tennessee and into Kentucky. They hoped to bring the Bluegrass State into the Confederacy just as General Robert E. Lee invaded Maryland in the east. A few months before the Congressional elections of November 1862, a successful Confederate advance in the Eastern and Western theaters could change the trajectory of the war. 
John Hunt Morgan's destructive raid in July gave a preview of what Kentuckians could expect. In mid-August, Smith's Confederate Army of Kentucky moved north from Knoxville into eastern Kentucky, easily scaling the Cumberland Mountains and gathering momentum as it plunged into the state's heartland. Smith's forces confronted and decimated a poorly organized federal force at Richmond, Ky., opening the way for the occupation of Lexington. After taking the Bluegrass city amid crowds of cheering spectators, Smith continued his push northward toward the Ohio River. The citizens of Cincinnati feared an invasion and quickly rushed to build defenses for the city.
Far larger but slower were the forces under General Bragg, who crossed the karst country of middle Tennessee, bypassed Nashville and followed the path of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad toward Louisville. Union General Don Carlos Buell, the hero of Shiloh, quickly moved his stunned troops northward to meet Bragg's invading army. A heroic, though small-scale, Union stand and defeat at the town of Munfordville delayed Bragg's army long enough to give the citizens of Louisville time to prepare their city for imminent Confederate attack. 
In the first week of October, Bragg stopped at the capital city of Frankfort and installed Kentucky's shadow Confederate governor, Richard Hawes, to the tune of marching bands. But it wasn't merely pomp and circumstance: the purpose of this rump inauguration was to enforce the Confederate Conscription Act, and thus forcibly enroll Kentuckians into the Confederate Army, which they had voluntarily avoided up to that point. 
Within minutes of the ceremony, General Buell's artillery appeared within range of the festivities and the Confederates quickly abandoned Frankfort. The only Confederate occupation of a Union capital proved more farce than revolution. Just days later, Bragg's men, stretched out in a defensive position across central Kentucky and unable to coordinate with Smith, finally engaged Buell in a major battle outside the town of Perryville. 
Bragg and Smith would abandon Kentucky after the bloody and inconclusive battle, but the disappointing refusal of Kentucky civilians to join the Confederate Army proved to be the most influential factor in Bragg's decision to retreat into Tennessee.
The failure of Kentuckians to meet the Confederate call to service that summer and fall was a decisive moment in the war. Had tens of thousands joined Bragg's and Smith's armies, the Confederacy could have secured the Bluegrass State and pushed the nascent republic's boundaries to the Ohio River. Cincinnati would remain under constant threat of invasion and the river would have been lost to the federal government as a highway of commerce and communication - not to mention an entryway to the Mississippi and the Deep South. 
Though many Kentuckians adopted a nostalgic, pro-Confederate identity after the war, why did the state's citizens summarily reject the Confederate call at this critical hour? The answer is a matter of timing and contingency. Kentucky Unionism was strong and deep in the early months of the war. But one central issue was already threatening the Unionist coalition in the state: emancipation. Kentuckians supported the Union because they believed it would best protect slavery. Even in mid-1862, they did not believe that President Lincoln, a native Kentuckian, would turn a war for the Union into a war for emancipation. 
Lincoln himself understood this, and while he did not exactly win the hearts and minds of Kentuckians in the war's early going, he did not provoke rebellion either. His prior support for the Confiscation Acts and his prodding of border-state legislators to accept compensated emancipation revealed his ultimate intentions to Bluegrass State voters. But he had yet to alter policy on the ground regarding Kentucky's sizable slave population. Even his Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, issued on Sept. 22, 1862, while Confederate forces remained in strength throughout the state, did little to push Kentuckians away from the federal government - it exempted Kentucky outright, and the very conservative General Buell reassured Kentucky's slaveholders that he would not interfere with the state's slave population while he was in charge. 
Much of that would change in 1863 and, especially, in 1864 as the Union Army began enlisting black Kentuckians in large numbers. But during the critical summer and fall of 1862, Kentucky's civilian population remained stubbornly resistant to Confederate calls for Southern unity and liberation from "federal despotism." 
The timing of Bragg's and Smith's invasion may have been perfect from a military standpoint - they caught Buell off guard and made a dramatic push for the Ohio River just months after the disaster at Shiloh. But politically, the timing of the invasion was almost perfectly wrong - too late to secure the allegiances of the state's leadership but too early to exploit white Kentuckians' sense of betrayal and outrage at the transformation of the Union effort into a war of emancipation.

HEADLINE: Increasing Savings With Promotional C.D. Rates

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Bonus or promotional rates on certificates of deposit can offer higher interest rates. 

 BODY:
Earlier this week, Bucks wrote about using "laddering" of certificates of deposit as a way to eke out extra interest on your savings. The Web site NerdWallet has done an analysis of banks and credit unions, and has another suggestion for increasing savings rates: promotional or bonus rates on C.D.'s.
While interest rates over all are meager, some institutions -- typically credit unions or smaller community banks -- may be offering time-limited rates to attract deposits as part of their capital strategy. Usually, such offers apply only to new funds coming in from elsewhere. You won't get the bonus rate if you're rolling over an existing C.D. at the bank. So if you're willing to shop around, and can resign yourself to moving your money when the promotional rate expires, you can increase the interest rate you earn -- and often tie up your money for a shorter period of time, NerdWallet found.
For its analysis, NerdWallet looked at data from Market Rates Insight for the 12 months ending in September and found that bonus rates over all offered up to an additional 0.68 percent over average rates. The average annual percentage yield for a three-year C.D., for instance, was just 0.7 percent, but the average bonus yield for the same term was nearly double that, at 1.38 percent.
The analysis also found that longer-term C.D.'s don't always yield higher returns than short-term certificates, when bonus rates are taken into account. Over the last year, for instance, one-year C.D.'s actually had lower rates than shorter, three- to nine-month bonus C.D.'s, NerdWallet determined.
The catch, of course, is finding these promotional rates, which by their nature are offered for a limited time. NerdWallet has started a weekly index, showing how promotional rates compare with average C.D. rates, and featuring some of the most attractive promotional rates available around the country. Consumers can use those rates as a point of comparison for promotional deals they may find at credit unions or community banks closer to home. (The site also to help search by ZIP code for the best interest rates on C.D.'s and savings accounts, but it generally doesn't include promotional rates, which change frequently.)
The caveat with credit unions is that they often have membership restrictions -- you have to work for certain employers, or live in a specific geographic area.
One credit union highlighted by NerdWallet this week, for example, is Service Credit Union, which serves military families as well as residents of specific towns in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. If you meet the membership criteria, you can join and avail yourself of a three-month C.D. with a 0.9 percent annual percentage yield.
Community banks may offer such rates, too, often without some of the membership hurdles, NerdWallet notes. Doral Bank in New York is offering a two-year C.D. at a 1.5 percent yield, NerdWallet found.

HEADLINE: A Global 1937

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The great mistake, repeated. 

 BODY:
Back in 2009, when there was (briefly) a policy consensus in favor of active fiscal policy to fight the slump, there were many warnings to the effect that we must not repeat the infamous mistake of 1937, in which FDR was persuaded to focus on balancing the budget while the economy was still weak, terminating the recovery from 1933 and sending America into the second leg of the Great Depression.
And what policy makers proceeded to do was, of course, to repeat the mistake of 1937.
The new IMF World Economic Outlook is, in effect, an extensively documented exercise in hand-wringing over the consequences of this repeat of bad history. Kudos to the Fund for having the courage to say this, which means bucking some powerful players as well as admitting that its own analysis was flawed.
There is, however, one point I think is getting skewed in the discussion of the IMF's new concern over premature austerity. Much of the discussion seems to focus on the question of relaxing the demands on debtor countries -- which is certainly a crucial issue for the eurozone. However, the global 1937 we're now experiencing isn't just about forced austerity in Spain, Greece, etc.. It's also -- and I think mainly -- about unforced austerity in countries that remain able to borrow very cheaply. 
Let's look at estimates of the cyclically adjusted budget deficit from the IMF's Fiscal Monitor, measured as a percentage of potential GDP. I don't think you want to take these numbers as gospel -- for Britain, at least, there's a very good case that the IMF is greatly understating potential output and hence overstating the structural deficit, and I suspect that this is true to a lesser extent for the US. But in any case the point is that even cheap-money countries facing no pressure either from the market or from external forces to engage in immediate austerity are nonetheless engaged in sharp fiscal contraction:
This is taking place in an environment in which the private sector is still deleveraging ferociously from the debt binge of the previous decade; so we're creating a situation in which both the private sector and the public sector are trying to slash spending relative to income. And whaddya know, the world economy is sputtering.
The truly amazing thing is that this calamitous error is not, for the most part, the result of special interests, or an unwillingness to make hard choices. On the contrary, it's being driven by Very Serious People who pride themselves on their willingness to make hard choices (which, naturally, involve inflicting pain on other people). In fact, I'd argue that the desire to make hard choices, or at least to be seen as doing so, is the reason the VSPs chose to ignore the extensive and, we now know, completely accurate warnings from some economists of what would happen if they gave in to their austerity obsession.
FT Alphaville says that I'm feeling a bit "smuggish" about all this; well, I'm only human. But truly, this is a terrible thing to behold.

HEADLINE: Is Jugaad Going Global?

BYLINE: PHILIP MCCLELLAN


HIGHLIGHT: An interview with the co-author of "Jugaad Innovation." 

 BODY:
 The word refers, literally, to a makeshift truck which my colleague Anand Giridharadas once memorably described as being "tossed together, saladlike, in the sheds of northern India, beyond regulators' view." Jugaad has also entered the lexicon as a concept known in management-speak as "frugal innovation." For some in India, jugaad represents the best of India - the ability of an enterprising people to make do with less. For others, it represents shoddy products and shady practices for which the country has long been known, and a fatalistic acceptance of that reality. 
 Jugaad has recently gained more attention in the West, thanks to the efforts of people like Navi Radjou, an enthusiastic member of the pro-jugaad camp. A Palo Alto-based "innovation and leadership strategist" who was born in Pondicherry, Mr. Radjou is co-author of "Jugaad Innovation," along with Jaideep Prabhu, a professor at Cambridge, and Simone Ahuja, founder of Blood Orange Media. The book, which was released in April, describes what Western companies can learn from jugaad and similar concepts common in many developing countries. The Indian edition is already into its second imprint. 
 A French national, Mr. Radjou has worked with companies such as Best Buy in the United States and he cites Carlos Ghosn, the chairman and chief executive of Nissan and Renault, as an admirer of the jugaad way. (In fact, Mr. Ghosn offers lavish praise of the book on the jacket sleeve.) Mr. Radjou is also a fan of MacGyver, the TV secret agent famous for fashioning implausibly high-tech gadgets with random objects and duct tape. "It was so jugaad," he says admiringly. Mr. Radjou sat down to discuss his book during the World Economic Forum meeting in Tianjin, China, in September. 
 Q. 
Tell me about the book.
 A. 
The book is a celebration of the ingenuity of entrepreneurs in emerging markets like India and China who, despite having very limited resources, are able to tap into their sheer ingenuity to come up with very simple but effective solutions to address major issues, whether it's in health care or education or any other sector you can think about.
Unlike the Western world, which invests billions of dollars in R&D, entrepreneurs in emerging markets use jugaad, which is a Hindi word which can be loosely translated as "the art of improvising frugal solutions." We looked at countries like India, China, Brazil and Africa, and in our book, "Jugaad Innovation," we profile dozens of such entrepreneurs who have come up with very frugal solutions for dealing with major issues in their local communities.
 Q. 
How is this relevant to the West?
 A. 
"Jugaad Innovation" is very relevant in today's context because in the West we are beginning to see two important changes happening. A lot of countries are facing extreme resource scarcity. But, also, there's more complexity because of demographic shifts, technology shifts and many other variables. In an environment that is becoming more complex and resource-scarce, you need to have a different approach to innovating. It can't be just investing billions of dollars in R&D; it has to be something that is more frugal. More flexible. But also more inclusive as well. And this approach of jugaad is all about that. It's a way of innovating faster, better and cheaper.
 Q. 
Can you give me an example?
 A. 
In India, an entrepreneur has come up with a company called Embrace. Embrace has developed a portable infant warmer, which is essentially a baby incubator. When you have premature babies, people tend to put them in a fixed incubator. And that incubator developed in the West costs up to $20,000. But this particular product costs only $200. Not only is it affordable, it delivers more value to the end user because it's a portable infant warmer - the mother can literally put the baby into this infant warmer and then hold it against her, which is very important for building that emotional bond.
Companies like Renault-Nissan have begun to embrace this kind of mindset. Carlos Ghosn is a big fan of jugaad. What he's doing is encouraging his R&D teams to come up with low-cost cars.
 Q. 
One of the criticisms of jugaad is that larger issues don't get solved because it's all about finding ways around problems.
 A. 
Jugaad in an emerging market context is often interpreted as somehow gaming the system. But actually what's happening is that in emerging markets, what you have is a lack of a system. It's not about gaming the system, but it's just that the system itself is nonexistent, whether it's in health care or any other industries. The system is not fully developed. So jugaad solutions fill a major vacuum that has not been filled either by the government or by corporations.
 Q. 
What inspired you to write this book?
 A. 
In 2008, when the U.S. recession started we recognized that the only way the U.S. could come out of recession was through innovation. We also knew that the old innovation model wouldn't be the right solution because it's very expensive, it's very inflexible. And it's not open enough. The three weaknesses we found in the U.S. innovation system is that it's expensive, it's elitist - only a few scientists innovate - and thirdly, it's inflexible because it takes eons to come up with new products and services.
So we asked ourselves whether there was an alternative model to innovating, a new approach to innovation which would have three opposite attributes. It would be frugal, it would be flexible, and thirdly it would be open and inclusive. And that's when we went around the world and we discovered these new approaches to innovation which we call, for lack of a better term, jugaad.
 Q. 
How much of your book is focused on India?
 A. 
About 60 percent of the examples in the book come from India; 40 percent come from other emerging markets.
We looked at India and saw that there were four variables in India that made it an ideal country for this kind of frugal and flexible approach to innovation. The first variable is complexity; the second one is liberty - Indian democracy; the third one is scarcity and the fourth one is interconnectivity.
 Q. 
Can you explain that?
 A. 
Diversity means that whatever works in one part of India might not work in another part of India. So it puts a lot of pressure on innovators to customize solutions. Liberty means that you have the freedom to innovate in a bottom-up fashion. Then you have scarcity of every kind - infrastructure, capital resources, water. And then you have interconnectivity, which is more like a boom - the explosion of cellphones and everything.
 Q. 
Can you give me an example?
 A. 
A lot of innovation in emerging markets like India is in things like mobile banking: 800 million people in India don't have access to a bank. You have 900 million people who have a cellphone. So if you are a jugaad thinker, you say the glass is half full, not half empty. And that's why you see all these mobile banking solutions popping up in places like India because the jugaad guys are able to convert this adversity into opportunity.
 Q. 
So what sort of jugaad examples are we seeing in the West?
 A. 
Sal Khan, who is head of the Khan Academy in California. The online video course he holds on YouTube - for me that's a great example of jugaad. He's really doing more for less; he's using a cheap platform like YouTube to create content, which is free and available for everybody, so you actually see individuals taking charge of driving this moment of jugaad in the U.S., and corporations are just waking up to this.
Companies like Procter and Gamble, G.E., 3M and Google are beginning to adopt this approach as well, because it ultimately allows you to innovate faster, better and cheaper. And there's no C.E.O. who won't like to do that. Especially in today's world.
 Q. 
Can you give an example of jugaad in the India of your childhood?
 A. 
Where I grew up, we never threw away anything. Everything got recycled. If a plastic bucket was slightly broken, we'd try to fix it. There was a whole jugaad industry which helped us reuse everything we had. It wasn't a consumption-driven economy when I grew up. All our toys were makeshift ones that we made with pieces of wood that you'd find somewhere in the street. So we used a lot of ingenuity, which was very abundant, to deal with the resources, which were more scarce.
 Q. 
Is this changing in India today as people become more consumption orientated?
 A. 
There's a tendency now in India to look for things that are more structured, more systematized, and I'm a bit concerned with that because, while it's true from a consumer's standpoint that you want things that are much more predictable and better quality, there's a misconception that jugaad necessarily means poor quality. Not all jugaad innovations have to be cheap and low quality.
Everyone says we need to produce more Ph.D.'s. We need the Ph.D.'s, but we need to also be comfortable with the MacGyver stuff.

HEADLINE: In Fight for a Mexican Company, a Peek Into a Tycoon's World

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: A legal battle between the billionaire hedge fund manager Paul E. Singer has focused a light on David Martinez, a Mexican financier who lives a rarefied but mysterious life in Manhattan. 

 BODY:
High above Columbus Circle, atop the Time Warner Center, is one of the most expensive apartments in Manhattan, a sleek aerie of steel and stone, high windows and soaring views.
It is the home of David Martinez, a Mexican financier who has minted a fortune buying and selling the debt of troubled countries and companies from Argentina to Pakistan. He paid about $42 million for the 12,000-square-foot duplex in 2003, then spent even more on additions and renovations, covering the space in stone and stainless steel.
The apartment has a private art collection that is said to include a $140 million Jackson Pollock. But for all his extravagant spending, Mr. Martinez is, even to his associates, something of a mystery.
Now a legal battle with another powerful investor is drawing back a curtain on Mr. Martinez's secretive world. While investors often have disputes that end up in court, this cross-border fight is with one of the giants in global distressed debt - Paul E. Singer, a major Republican donor. The dispute, and its eventual victor, could have implications for other companies in the world's fastest-growing economies.
The fight is over the bankruptcy of Mexico's largest glassmaker, Vitro, a 103-year-old company run by the Sada family, one of the wealthiest in Monterrey. Allegations abound of covert meetings, fraudulent debts and crooked courts in a bankruptcy that ended up leaving control of the company in the hands of its shareholders, while costing bondholders as much as 60 percent of their investment, according to some estimates.
That runs counter to what typically happens in an American bankruptcy, and Mr. Singer and other Vitro creditors have argued that if Vitro and Mr. Martinez prevail, other Mexican companies could have trouble raising money in the United States.
Both men are known as "vulture investors," a term applied to those who buy up cheap debt that no one wants. The strategy has made Mr. Singer's company, Elliott Management, one of the most successful hedge funds in the world. Mr. Singer, 68, cut his teeth wrangling payments on defaulted debt from countries like Peru and Congo, and has earned a reputation for bare-knuckled doggedness unparalleled on Wall Street. Just last week, Elliott Management persuaded a court in Ghana to seize an Argentine naval ship in a dispute over the South American country's bonds.
Yet he may have met his match in Mr. Martinez. Over the last 20 years, the 55-year-old financier has plowed billions of dollars into troubled corners of the global economy, often aligning himself with the management of bankrupt companies.
"If you don't know who the sucker is in a particular deal, it's probably you," a top investor in distressed debt said. "When David is involved, you know he isn't the sucker."
He and others interviewed for this article declined to be identified speaking about Mr. Martinez, citing the continuing litigation or fear of angering him. Through a spokesman, Mr. Martinez declined to comment.
Little is known about the financier, who splits his time between New York and London, where he runs an obscure investment company called Fintech Advisory Ltd. In life as in business, Mr. Martinez treads lightly. He is fond of shell companies, whether to buy artwork or to pay household expenses. Those he hires often know him only as "the client."
But Mr. Martinez and Mr. Singer are not strangers. They have clashed before, most notably during Argentina's debt restructuring in 2005. While Elliott is still holding out for a more lucrative settlement with the nation over its defaulted bonds, Fintech sided with Argentina in 2005, a move that some bondholders felt undermined efforts to force the country to pay what it owed.
In the case of Vitro, Elliott and allied investors contend that Mr. Martinez helped the Mexican company muscle investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars through financial sleight of hand. Mr. Singer and his counterparts, who own about $700 million worth of the company's old debt, have called Vitro's efforts "a testament to audacity, brazen manipulation and greed."
Vitro says that it has done nothing illegal. The maneuvers, it says, are standard practice under Mexican law and have been used in many other bankruptcies there. Fintech noted that a United States bankruptcy court, which is handling the bankruptcy of Vitro's United States subsidiaries, found no wrongdoing this summer. "Such McCarthy-like allegations were unsupported," lawyers for Fintech wrote in court documents.
The conflict has its roots in 2009, when Vitro found itself mired in trouble after the financial crisis. Bad derivatives bets had dried up its cash, and it began defaulting on its debt. The company called on Mr. Martinez for help.
To get some much-needed cash, the company struck a deal with the investor: a $75 million loan in exchange for the title to several of its properties. As part of the arrangement, Mr. Martinez was given an option to return the properties to Vitro, once it emerged from bankruptcy, in exchange for a 24 percent stake in the company - effectively aligning his interests with management as it negotiated with other creditors.
In mid-2010, he went to the different banks that Vitro owed money to and bought the claims. In the process, Mr. Martinez became the biggest individual outside creditor, owning about $600 million worth of claims.
The company began taking big loans from its subsidiaries, in effect creating a fresh class of creditors outside of the hedge funds - a group under its control, with the rights to approve any bankruptcy plan. Subsidiaries went from owing the parent company about $1.2 billion to being owed $1.5 billion.
With the help of Mr. Martinez, the company outvoted many other bondholders to approve a reorganization plan.
That maneuver was upheld by a court in Monterrey, allowing Vitro to proceed with a plan that pays creditors an estimated 40 to 60 percent of what they are owed and keeps the Sada family in control.
Mr. Singer and the hedge funds have taken the fight to the United States, suing Vitro and Fintech. This summer, the hedge funds won a round, as a federal judge in Dallas declined to uphold the Mexican court's ruling. Arguments in the appeal were heard earlier this month.
The outcome of this case, experts say, could have implications for other companies in fast-growing economies. A country that appears to be undermining protections that are typically granted to creditors in a bankruptcy might scare investors away. "This is a precedent-setting case, no matter how it turns out," said Arturo Porzecanski, economist in residence at American University's School of International Service. "It has highlighted apparent loopholes in the bankruptcy law of Mexico, through which Vitro ran an 18-wheel truck."
In suing Fintech, the hedge funds encountered one obstacle early on: they couldn't find Mr. Martinez.
When servers went to Fintech's Park Avenue offices to deliver the summons, they could not reach him. They stood outside the Time Warner Center for weeks hoping to catch him, to no avail.
Eventually, the lawsuit found its way to the investment company in London.
Mr. Martinez was born in 1957 and grew up in Monterrey, which is home to some of Mexico's largest industrial companies. Power there is heavily concentrated among businessmen in the so-called Group of 10, a club that includes the Sada family, which controls Vitro.
Though Mr. Martinez was not a part of that circle, he has cultivated deep connections to it. The Sadas relied on Mr. Martinez to help them maintain control of another of their companies that went bankrupt in 2004.
As a young man, Mr. Martinez was a member of Regnum Christi, an evangelical group related to the Legionaries of Christ, an influential Roman Catholic order in Mexico that includes among its benefactors the billionaire Carlos Slim. After earning an engineering degree from the Tecnológico de Monterrey, Mr. Martinez moved to Rome to study philosophy at the Pontifical Gregorian University and considered becoming a priest.
But he was drawn to Wall Street instead, and earned a third degree from Harvard Business School before taking a job at Citigroup on the emerging-markets desk in New York. There, he began his long affair with distressed debt in far-flung places. In 1985, he left the bank and eventually founded Fintech.
While it is unclear how much money the company controls, or even how many employees work there, bits and pieces have emerged about Mr. Martinez over the years. Often it relates to his art collection, which includes the works of Damien Hirst and Mark Rothko.
In his lavish redoubt overlooking the city and Central Park from the penthouse of the Time Warner Center's South Tower, Mr. Martinez has fashioned a gallery for his art. The apartment has a two-story living room and a reflecting pool, according to public records and interviews with people familiar with the unit. A special system has been rigged to support one exceptionally heavy piece of art.
Even before the costly renovations by the architect Peter Marino, the home was among the city's most expensive residences.
But Mr. Martinez still had spending to do. In the fall of 2006, word spread that Jackson Pollock's "No. 5, 1948" had been sold for $140 million, a record at the time. The buyer was said to be Mr. Martinez - a rumor that lawyers for Mr. Martinez denied, sending the art world into a state of confusion as to the whereabouts of the painting.
Through a spokesman, Mr. Martinez still denies that he owns the work. But according to several people with knowledge of the collection, the painting currently hangs in his New York home.

HEADLINE: Lawmen Against the Law

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: In three states, police and prosecutors are now backing legalization of marijuana. 

 BODY:
SEATTLE - Last November, the former chief federal prosecutor from Washington State took the stage before a hall full of cops and tried to persuade the people who enforce the drug laws to change them - specifically, to get aboard what will most likely turn out to the nation's first successful campaign to legalize marijuana.
The sheriffs and police chiefs listened politely to John McKay, a silver-haired, Jesuit-educated lawyer who had been appointed prosecutor by President George W. Bush. The marijuana laws - "giving us the right to come to your home and take away your personal liberty for something that much of the community thinks is not a crime" - are a travesty, a farce and a crime generator, he said.
Afterward, the cops voted not to support the ideas that became Washington's Initiative 502, which would legalize recreational use of marijuana for adults. But many officers pulled McKay aside and quietly cheered him on.
"They came up to me and said, 'We know you're right - we just can't say so,'" McKay recalled in an interview this week in Seattle.
Voters in three states - Washington, Oregon and Colorado - will decide on Election Day whether to take marijuana out of the black market shadows and put it under the daylight of state licensing and supervision. Each proposal has problems and pluses. But Washington's is the one most likely to pass, judging from the polls.

In a twist of time that any aging baby boomer can appreciate, this measure has the full backing of what used to be called the Establishment. 
And if, on Nov. 6, a state finally says no to one of the most counterproductive prohibitions in the nation's history, it will be because the two sides in this continuing sham of Wile E. Coyote versus Road Runner have essentially switched.
That's right: those on the front lines of the endless drug war, the police and prosecutors, are now citing futility and common sense on behalf of legalization - at least in this state. And many of those who now profit from the unregulated medical marijuana industry, and the larger, organized crime gangs that control the illegal wholesale scene, are against legalization. The opposition to accessible pot in this state is led by a medical marijuana clinic. Go figure.
Not all cops back legalization, of course. But here in Washington, the former top F.B.I. agent for the region, Charles Mandingo, a 27-year veteran of the drug wars, has come out in favor of legal pot. He cited the racial disparity - that far more blacks are locked up for dope than whites - among many reasons for the evolution of his view. 
And the two candidates for sheriff in King County, the state's most populous, are practically tripping over themselves in their advocacy for doing away with marijuana possession crime. 
By contrast, presenting a fine historic irony, the only organized opposition to legalization in this state is coming from longtime marijuana advocates - the "dispensary-quackery complex, which has turned medical marijuana into a money-grubbing sham," as The News Tribune newspaper of South Puget Sound memorably put it. 
These pot retailers, peddling weed under a tolerance policy to anyone with an easy-to-get prescription, are backing the status quo because they make so much money off it. For the same reason, violent gangsters from Mexico to Canada are afraid of what Washington is on the verge of doing.
The dispensaries would have to give up a freewheeling business for a controlled retail environment - licensed, regulated and taxed (at 25 percent) by the state. When California voters faced the same issue two years ago, it was also the drug cartels and the medical pot shops that fought it, and prevailed.
This time, the pillars of the community have the upper hand. McKay, now a law professor at Seattle University, has no love for pot. He knows, and has seen firsthand, how chronic use can have consequences. 
"I don't think smoking marijuana is a good thing," he said. "And I don't think it's a healthy thing. But as the chief federal law enforcement officer in this region I became convinced that our policy on marijuana is just plain wrong." It's a waste of young lives, and certainly police resources, to arrest 10,000 people a year in Washington for marijuana, he says. His sentiments are backed by leading newspapers and a number of other prosecutors, ministers and cops.
Under the Washington initiative, anyone over 21 could buy up to an ounce at a time. The proposal would also have a driving-while-stoned provision, with a maximum legal limit for THC in the blood. And, for locovores, it would require that all pot would have to be grown and processed in the state of Washington.
Will it work? The hurdles include the federal government, which still classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 illegal drug like heroin and cocaine. They could move against the states. 
But that sort of conflict, says McKay, needs to play out for American society to finally move on. In the United States almost 30 million people have used marijuana in the last year. Most of them are not criminals by any stretch, he says. "History has taught us that social change begins with rebellion among the states," he said. And in this case, when drug warriors switch sides.

HEADLINE: Before a Big Crowd in Ohio, Romney Glides on Debate's Lift

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: As he wrapped up a second day of all-in effort in this critical battleground state, Mr. Romney continued to rally large crowds, the biggest of his campaign, and to glide on the lift of his debate performance last week. 

 BODY:
SIDNEY, Ohio - "I'm overwhelmed by the number of people here. There are even people out there, that's another county over there," Mitt Romney said as he surveyed a sea of supporters at the county fairgrounds here in western Ohio on Wednesday.
As he wrapped up a second day of all-in effort in this critical battleground state, Mr. Romney continued to rally large crowds, the biggest of his campaign, and to glide on the lift of his debate performance last week. Every reference to the debate drew cheers. The Romney campaign said the throng numbered 9,500, citing the Secret Service.
"This is bigger than the fair was," said Louie Pennycuff, 64. "After the debate, people woke up."
Earlier in the day when Mr. Romney visited a bakery restaurant, throngs lined the streets of Delaware, Ohio, for his motorcade as if for a Fourth of July parade.
Mr. Romney, who all year has allowed Democrats to define him as a rich son of privilege who wants to benefit his own kind but lacks empathy for ordinary people, seems to have broken free of that image. Certainly the crowds who come to see him are not of the plutocratic class.

He released a new television advertisement on Wednesday using a clip of the presidential debate in which he asserted, "Middle-income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300."
His stump speech these days is less about small businesses whose owners "did built that," than about conveying empathy for working-class Americans with economic anxieties. He introduced unlikely and surprising new characters to his speech: he offered praise for "a single mom who's trying to raise a kid or two or three," and "a dad who's taking on multiple jobs."
At an appearance earlier in the day in Mount Vernon, he stood with the chief executive of a factory, Karen Buchwald Wright, but perhaps the most memorable thing he said was not about her business but that she and Ann Romney, the candidate's wife, "are both breast cancer survivors." He wore a breast cancer awareness pin.
The Obama campaign responded to Mr. Romney's new ad, "Helping the Middle Class," by revisiting the analysis by independent tax experts that the tax plan Mr. Romney has proposed, including a 20 percent across-the-board rate cut without adding to the deficit, would mean increased taxes for the middle class.
"Here's what the real Mitt Romney's plan would mean for middle class families: a $2,000 tax increase for those with kids to pay for $250,000 tax cuts for multimillionaires - he just won't be straight with voters about it," said Danny Kanner, an Obama campaign spokesman.
Many of Mr. Romney's talking points have a populist ring, though they are less populist on closer inspection. Attacking Mr. Obama, he said, "He wants to raise the tax on savings," a reference to the president's proposal to increase taxes on investment income, even though it is mostly the rich who receive income from dividends and capital gains.
The president wants to "put in place a death tax which will make it more difficult for people to pass farms on," Mr. Romney said at a lectern with a sign, "Farmers for Mitt." He did not mention that Mr. Obama's proposal includes a $3.5 million exemption. The Congressional Budget Office has said that only a handful of farms a year nationally would owe any estate taxes.
The most striking aspect of the more empathetic Mr. Romney appearing on the stump is a series of reminiscences of people whose lives were tragically cut short. On Wednesday, however, he dropped one account introduced the day before, about having met a former Navy SEAL killed in the attack on the American outpost in Libya, after the man's mother objected.
Barbara Doherty, the mother of Glen A. Doherty, who was killed in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, told WHDH-TV in Boston: "I don't trust Romney. He shouldn't make my son's death part of his political agenda. It's wrong to use these brave young men, who wanted freedom for all, to degrade Obama."
Mr. Romney did not mention Mr. Doherty at his evening rally. Instead, he told a story about a Boy Scout troop that convinced NASA to include its American flag in a Space Shuttle mission, only to watch the vehicle, Challenger, explode "before their eyes" on television. The flag miraculously was found intact. Mr. Romney described standing beside it at a scout ceremony. "I looked over at that flag and I pulled it out and it was like electricity was running through my arms," he said.
To him, it represented the spirit of Americans sacrificing "for something bigger than themselves."

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Swings

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 

        
Mitt Romney is getting better marks on leadership after his dominant performance last week at the Denver presidential debate, while President Obama is benefiting from improvements in the economy, according to the latest Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News poll. Michael D. Shear and Megan Thee-Brennan write that surveys of likely voters in three swing states -- Colorado, Virginia and Wisconsin -- showed Mr. Obama holding a slim advantage in Virginia and Wisconsin, but tied with Mr. Romney in Colorado.

        
Capitalizing on Mr. Romney's breakout performance at the debate, his campaign has revved up efforts to soften his conservative edges and showcase him in bipartisan and personal ways. Michael Barbaro and Ashley Parker write that aides believe their strategy -- to "defy the perceptions that have dogged him throughout the race" -- is their best shot at victory, but it risks raising questions about Mr. Romney's authenticity.

        
The tight race between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney has created some uncertainty in the health care field, where providers and insurers are putting off long-term planning until voters decide who will occupy the White House for the next four years. Abby Goodnough and Robert Pear outline the stark differences between the president and his Republican rival's visions for the future of the American health care system.

        
The Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday in a case challenging the use of race in public college admissions. Adam Liptak writes that the court's ideological center has shifted rightward since it last heard a similar case nine years ago, and with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy -- who has never voted to uphold an affirmative action program -- at the center, there is reason to believe the court could overturn its earlier decision.

        
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will face Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, in a debate tonight. Trip Gabriel writes that Mr. Ryan's budget proposal, the "fiscal cliff" and foreign policy are among the issues that will loom large in the debate..

        
Looking back at vice-presidential debates past, John Harwood writes that although those confrontations rarely have an impact on the outcome of the elections, experts opine that they can "increase momentum for a ticket considered to have won the first debate of the presidential nominees, or serve as 'a circuit breaker' for the ticket that lost." Happening in Washington: 

        
Economic reports expected today include international trade for August and weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed by weekly mortgage rates at 10.

        
At 9:15 a.m., Mike Hammer, the assistant secretary of state for public affairs, will answer questions about American foreign policy in a Spanish-language Twitter briefing.

        
At 10, Jeremy C. Stein, who joined the Federal Reserve's board of governors in May, will talk about the central bank's recent policy decisions at the Brookings Institution.

HEADLINE: The Fallout From JPMorgan's Loss

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Federal authorities are developing criminal cases related to the multibillion-dollar trading loss at JPMorgan Chase. | The buyout industry may not be as fiercely competitive as it seems. | Congress should consider setting a specific limit on the size of financial institutions, a Fed official said. | Goldman Sachs is already preparing a response to Greg Smith's book. 

 BODY:
FALLOUT FROM JPMORGAN LOSS | Federal authorities are developing criminal cases related to the multibillion-dollar trading loss at JPMorgan Chase, and arrests could come in the next several months, report DealBook's Ben Protess and Azam Ahmed. As part of their effort, investigators are poring over thousands of recorded phone calls; in some, employees discussed "how to value the troubled bets in a favorable way."
The investigation focuses on four people who worked in the bank's chief investment office in London, including Bruno Iksil, the trader known as the London whale, and Achilles Macris, an executive in that unit. DealBook writes: "Authorities are examining how some traders in the chief investment office influenced market prices as their bets began to sour. Investigators are also looking into whether records were falsified to hide the problems from executives in New York."
Jamie Dimon, the chief executive, called the money-losing trades a "stupid error" during a talk at the Council on Foreign Relations on Wednesday. He also addressed the acquisition of Bear Stearns in 2008, estimating JPMorgan ultimately lost "$5 billion to $10 billion" on the deal. Calling the deal a "favor" to the government, Mr. Dimon said he might not do it again, "knowing what I know today."
JPMorgan's chief financial officer, Douglas Braunstein, is expected to step down by the end of the year, in the latest management change since the trading loss, reports Jessica Silver-Greenberg for DealBook. Mr. Braunstein, whose reputation suffered after the trades went bad, is expected to remain at the bank after giving up his post, Ms. Silver-Greenberg reports.
A judge in Oklahoma this week found that JPMorgan was "grossly negligent and reckless" in handling a client's trust account, ordering the company to pay $18 million, DealBook's Susanne Craig reports. The judge said the bank breached its fiduciary duties to the trust of Carolyn S. Burford, an oil heiress who died in 1996.
PRIVATE EQUITY'S CLUBBY WAYS | The buyout industry may not be as fiercely competitive as it seems. Newly released e-mails in a civil lawsuit that dates back to the private equity boom times depict "a secret pact between the firms that divided up the big deals among themselves and artificially - and illegally - kept their prices low," write Peter Lattman and Eric Lichtblau in DealBook. For instance, K.K.R. asked competitors to "step down" during the bidding for the hospital chain HCA in 2006, according to an e-mail written by Daniel Akerson, then a partner at Carlyle and now the chief executive of General Motors. At that time, the suggestion that these firms might be colluding was enough to send the business "into a panic," Andrew Ross Sorkin wrote in 2006.
Proving the case could be difficult. Fortune's Dan Primack notes that "it's tough to argue conspiracy against so many firms on such a large number of deals, particularly when the record is clear that many of the defendants competed against each other on some of those very transactions."
HOW BIG IS TOO BIG? | Congress should consider setting a specific limit on the size of financial institutions, Daniel K. Tarullo, a Federal Reserve Board governor, said in a speech on Wednesday. Mr. Tarullo argued that there would be merit in "adopting a simpler policy instrument, rather than relying on indirect, incomplete policy measures such as administrative calculation of potentially complex financial stability footprints." 
ON THE AGENDA | 
Realogy is set to start trading today after pricing its I.P.O. at $27 a share, the top of the expected range. Workday, the human resources software company, is expected to price its offering this evening. Safeway reports earnings before the market opens. Maurice R. "Hank" Greenberg, the former A.I.G. chairman, is on Bloomberg TV at 8:14 a.m. Sean Egan, the president of Egan-Jones Ratings Company, is on CNBC at 10 a.m. Donald J. Trump is on CNBC at 4:10 p.m. Larry Summers is appearing on Bloomberg TV at 4:30 p.m. And Jeff Weiner, the chief executive of LinkedIn, is on Bloomberg TV at 6 p.m. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. faces off with Representative Paul D. Ryan tonight in the vice-presidential debate.
GOLDMAN AND THE MUPPETS | 
Greg Smith's book, "Why I Left Goldman Sachs," doesn't come out until later this month, but his former employer is already preparing a response. Goldman "has told its board of directors that an internal investigation found little substance to allegations" made by Mr. Smith, The Financial Times reports. Mr. Smith, who took Goldman to task for its profit-driven ways, also worried about his own pay; he was said to have asked to make more than $1 million, prompting one manager to say he "needs to tone it down."
As for his claim that Goldman employees referred derisively to clients as "muppets," The Financial Times says Goldman found about 4,000 mentions of "muppet" in e-mails, but 99 percent were in reference to last year's movie.
JULIAN ROBERTSON'S ADVICE |

HEADLINE: Paul Ryan's Debate Challenge

BYLINE: MATT BAI


HIGHLIGHT: How will Paul D. Ryan navigate between his running mate's latest ideological turn on tax cuts and the orthodoxy of economic conservatives on the other? 

 BODY:
Long before he was anointed Mitt Romney's running mate, Paul D. Ryan was the young hero of Washington's supply-side crowd. And so it will be interesting to see how Mr. Ryan, in his debate with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday, plans to navigate between his running mate's latest ideological turn, on one hand, and the orthodoxy of economic conservatives on the other. 
In a late and frantic dash to the center, Mr. Romney argued for the first time in last week's debate that his plan to scale back income tax rates for the wealthy didn't really add up to a tax cut. This surprising parry seemed to leave the president at a loss for words, as if Mr. Romney had just asserted that nuclear warheads weren't actually weapons.
Afterward, most of the commentary centered on the immediate question of whether Mr. Romney's plan would add some $5 trillion to the deficit, as Mr. Obama claimed, or whether Mr. Romney could make the plan "revenue-neutral." But Mr. Romney's argument was remarkable for larger, philosophical reasons, and it presents something of a dilemma for Mr. Ryan as he considers his own debate strategy.
First, it should be noted that by backing away from the idea of tax cuts, Mr. Romney seemed to be acknowledging a dramatic shift in the politics of the issue. At least since 1984, when Walter Mondale announced he was going to level with the American people about his plan to raise taxes and walked away with a whopping 13 electoral votes, Democrats have been on the defensive over taxes, and Republicans have been pressing the advantage. In campaign after campaign, Republican candidates vowed to lower taxes (mostly for the wealthy), while Democrats strove to persuade voters they weren't going to raise them.
In Denver, however, it was the Republican who found himself backing away from party orthodoxy. Here was Mr. Romney fleeing from the suggestion that he supported tax cuts for the wealthy, when by any reasonable definition he did. And here was the Democratic president, insisting that he was against those same tax cuts, even though he could fairly have taken credit for having extended them during his term. 
This reversal by itself should bother the economic conservatives who believe that ever-lower taxes are a prerequisite for growth. But Mr. Romney didn't simply distance himself from conservatives on the politics of taxation. By any literal reading of what he said, Mr. Romney broke with conservatives on the substance of their argument, too.
From the Reagan era until now, conservatives have traveled a path from being anti-tax to anti-government. In other words, their main conviction now isn't simply that tax rates are too high, but that government gets too much in revenue, and that the only way to stimulate growth is to "starve the beast" of the federal bureaucracy and force government to reduce its commitments.
Another important tenet of economic conservatism holds that the wealthy Americans already pay more than their fair share of taxes, as a percentage of the total, while too many Americans pay close to nothing. And conservative tax activists like Grover Norquist contend that rescinding some expensive "tax expenditures" - like, say, the mortgage interest deduction for homeowners or some industry subsidies - would amount to tax increases on the average American.
At last week's debate, however, Mr. Romney could not have been clearer in rejecting all of these premises. "I'm not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the revenues going to the government," Mr. Romney said flatly. He added that he would not reduce the tax burden born by wealthy Americans. And he promised to eliminate unspecified tax expenditures.
In short, Romney now seems to be pretty much where John A. Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House, was in his budget negotiations with Mr. Obama last year. Mr. Boehner actually entertained an offer that would have added as much as $1.4 trillion over ten years in additional revenue. (Although, like Mr. Romney, Mr. Boehner was assuming that a lot of that additional revenue would come from the supply-side alchemy of lower tax rates spurring economic growth).
But that's not where Mr. Ryan or the other conservatives in the House are, which is why Mr. Boehner's gambit ultimately went nowhere with his own caucus. They favor less revenue for government, not more, and they oppose a more progressive tax code that would heap even more of the overall burden on the wealthiest Americans.
Perhaps Republican activists weren't listening very hard to what Mr. Romney was actually saying last week; their attitude seems to be that he won the debate and climbed in the polls, and that's all that matters. But you can bet that Mr. Ryan's admirers in the policy world took note of Mr. Romney's moderate rhetoric, which sounded a lot like the "big-government conservatism" they sometimes deride.
Mr. Ryan will almost certainly be asked to elaborate on the tax plan at Thursday's debate. And the question is whether he can get fully behind Mr. Romney's pronouncements about not lowering taxes on the rich and holding the line on federal revenue, or whether he will try to subtly walk it back, so as not to tarnish his brand as the keeper of the conservative faith.
The answer may tell us something about whether Mr. Ryan is thinking only about this election, or whether he also has his mind on carrying the conservative mantle for years to come.

HEADLINE: Health Care Under Romney: The Status Quo Ante

BYLINE: JULIET LAPIDOS


HIGHLIGHT: In Ohio, the candidate suggested that the pre-reform health care system was good enough. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney, who has promised to "repeal and replace" the Affordable Care Act, but has never explained what the replacement will look like, hinted on Wednesday that his secret plan is to bring back the status quo ante.
At a rally in Mt. Vernon, Ohio, he said the A.C.A. was unnecessary for people with chronic conditions: "Actually, we had health care in America before Obamacare came along. And we still have health care in America." He added, "People who are poor are able to get Medicaid, which is a government support effort for those who can't afford to have insurance. And these things aren't going to disappear without Obamacare."
Yes, "we" had health care in America before the A.C.A. - in a manner of speaking. Some Americans had health care; others did not.

Mr. Romney seems to have conveniently forgotten that millions of people who are not poor enough for Medicaid do not have private insurance. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, roughly 4 in 25 Americans, or nearly 49 million Americans, had no health insurance last year. Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that repealing the A.C.A. would deny access to insurance to about 30 million Americans who would receive coverage if the president's reforms were to stay in place.
Mr. Romney also failed to mention that his budget proposal to cap federal spending at 20 percent of G.D.P. and boost defense spending to 4 percent of G.D.P. would result in massive cuts to Medicaid. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program "would face cumulative cuts of $1.5 trillion through 2022 if Medicare is subject to cuts and $1.9 trillion if Medicare is exempt." As a result "14 to 19 million more people" would join "the ranks of the uninsured."
In a Wednesday meeting with the editorial board of an Ohio newspaper, The Dispatch, Mr. Romney again suggested that the pre-reform health care system was good enough, and also minimized the gravity of forgoing insurance.
"We don't have a setting across this country where if you don't have insurance, we just say to you, 'Tough luck, you're going to die when you have your heart attack.'" Instead "you go to the hospital, you get treated, you get care, and it's paid for, either by charity, the government or by the hospital. We don't have people that become ill, who die in their apartment because they don't have insurance."
So there you have it. The Romney plan: Let them have emergency care. Setting aside the fact that personal-responsibility types should feel appalled - Mr. Romney's endorsing cost-shifting from the patient to the general health-care market - it's not true that no one dies because they don't have insurance. Families USA, a health care advocacy group, issued a report in June indicating that 26,100 people between the ages of 25 and 64 died prematurely due to lack of health coverage in 2010.

HEADLINE: Read This Book, Win the Election

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Both president candidates might find attractive ideas for banking regulation in a new book by the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
With the presidential election looming and both sides looking for a knockout blow in the vice-presidential debate on Thursday evening, now is a good time for both Democrats and Republicans to look for one more defining issue. The new book by Sheila Bair, "Bull by the Horns: Fighting to Save Main Street From Wall Street and Wall Street From Itself," offers exactly that - to whichever party is smart enough and fast enough to take up the opportunity.
Ms. Bair lays out a compelling vision for financial-sector reform and for dealing with the continuing mess around mortgages. Neither presidential campaign is likely to endorse her ideas in all their specifics. But if a candidate signaled that he had read and understood the main messages in this book, this would have great appeal with undecided centrist votes and - importantly - with their respective bases.
Ms. Bair was chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from June 2006 to July 2011. She had a seat at the table for all the big decisions during the financial crisis of 2007-9, and she was also an important player during the financial reform negotiations of 2009-10, leading up to the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation of 2010. 
(Disclosure: I'm a member of the nongovernmental Systemic Risk Council that Ms. Bair created and leads; I was also appointed to the F.D.I.C.'s Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee while Ms. Bair was still chairwoman.)
Ms. Bair, a Republican from Kansas, worked with Bob Dole and was appointed to the F.D.I.C. by President George W. Bush. Her defining positions were against the interests of the very largest financial institutions.
And her biggest confrontations were with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and, according to Ms. Bair, someone who continually favored the largest banks and their profitability in the mistaken view that this would serve the broader social interest in financial stability and sustained economic prosperity.
During the height of the financial crisis, Mr. Geithner wanted at various times to commit more taxpayer resources with fewer conditions to support very large banks, including allowing them to pay very large bonuses to executives. Ms. Bair was consistently on the side of wanting more strings attached - the point being that these financial institutions had managed themselves into great trouble. As she notes on Page 363:
An institution that is profitable is not necessarily one that is safe and sound or one that is serving the public interest. All of the large financial institutions were profitable in the years leading up to the crisis, but they were making big profits by taking big risks that ultimately exploded in their - and our - faces.
Ms. Bair's point was not about any kind of retribution but rather that the long experience of the F.D.I.C. indicated that the best time to clean up any financial sector mess was at the moment and point of intervention. Because it has insured small depositors - the public - since the 1930s, the F.D.I.C. has developed a well-informed approach to failing banks. It works hard to ensure that depositor protection works - and it does - without imposing costs on the taxpayer.
When I worked at the International Monetary Fund during 2004-6 and 2007-8, we regarded the F.D.I.C. as carrying out best practice in the world with regard to how to handle failing banks.
In Ms. Bair's persuasive account, the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations were primarily focused on protecting the large banks. Both administrations consistently ignored the relationship between the need to fix our bloated, free-wheeling financial sector and sustaining our broader economic prosperity. And both administrations paid insufficient attention to the persistent problem of mortgages.
In most financial crises, there is some form of "debt overhang" problem, meaning that the economy cannot fully get back on its feet until loans are written down, typically through some form of bankruptcy or negotiated restructuring process. Some of the most fascinating details in "Bull by the Horns" concern instances when Ms. Bair and her F.D.I.C. colleagues proposed various ways to deal with mortgages, only to be shot down or undermined by Mr. Geithner and his colleagues at Treasury (see, for example, Chapter 21).
Judging from the most recent presidential debate, the candidates are still not drawing the link from stable finance to economic prosperity, and they are offering no ideas on how to restructure mortgages.
As new cases are brought against big banks for their mortgage-lending practices, including JPMorgan Chase (for activities of Bear Stearns, which it acquired in 2008) and, this week, Wells Fargo, policy thinking increasingly must grapple with how to structure a potential "global settlement" on mortgages.
It would be good for Ms. Bair to have a seat at that table; most of the workable ideas are already articulated in her book. More broadly, her policy suggestions are simple and obvious, like putting tougher limits on the ability of large financial institutions to take risks with borrowed money, requiring those who securitize mortgages to retain risk if the mortgages later default and breaking up institutions so large and interconnected that they cannot be resolved in bankruptcy without causing wider damage to our economy.
Ms. Bair's messages and common sense have appeal across the American political spectrum. The right wants an end to implicit government subsidies for large financial institutions. The left wants to curtail the power of global megabanks. Independents want Wall Street to have less political sway in Washington. These are all reasonable and responsible requests.
Either Mr. Romney or Mr. Obama could seize upon the themes in Ms. Bair's book, craft these into political language and hammer home the substance in the concluding weeks of the campaign.
Or they could just quote the final paragraph of the book:
Life goes on, as Robert Frost observed. But financial abuse and misconduct don't have to. Tell the powers in Washington that you want these problems fixed, you want them fixed now and that you will hold all incumbents accountable until the job is done.

HEADLINE: A Closer Look at Romney's Small-Business Tax and Jobs Claims

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The numbers Governor Romney used in the first presidential debate are startling. But are they accurate? 

 BODY:
At the first presidential match-up in Denver last week, Mitt Romney injected new charges into the discussion of what will happen to small businesses if taxes are raised on the wealthy. Speaking of President Obama's proposal to let the Bush-era tax cuts expire for those who earn more than $250,000, the Republican candidate told the president that the impact would be felt by only 3 percent of businesses but that those businesses "happen to employ half - half - of all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs."
Startling numbers, but are they accurate? Well, the first two are not, and the last is disputed.
Let's look at the share of employment first, Mr. Romney's charge that letting the Bush tax cuts expire for the top two tax brackets will specifically hit businesses that employ half of all the people who work in small businesses and a quarter of all American workers. The Romney campaign declined to discuss its source, but the assertion closely echoes a figure circulated by the N.F.I.B., when the advocacy group sent a letter to Congress two years ago opposing any tax increases, including on the wealthy.
That letter said, in part: "Based on an N.F.I.B. small-business survey, the businesses most likely to face a tax increase by raising the top two rates are businesses employing between 20 and 250 employees. According to U.S. Census data, businesses with between 20 and 299 workers employ more than 25 percent of the total work force."
There are two things to say about this statement, as retold by Mr. Romney. First, there is the obvious error of transmission in his retelling -- that these companies account for a quarter of the work force, when in fact the Census Bureau cohort included companies with up to 299 employees (not 250). But the bigger issue is the implication that all of these businesses (by Mr. Romney in the debate) or most of them (by the N.F.I.B. in its letter) face a tax increase under the Obama plan.
In fact, the survey (pdf) at the root of the claim suggests the opposite -- that a minority of these businesses in this size category, about 22 percent of them, earned more than $250,000 in business income, the threshold for higher taxes under the Obama plan. According to the Census Bureau figures that the N.F.I.B. relied on (available from the S.B.A.), in 2007, when the N.F.I.B. poll was taken, businesses with 20 to 299 employees employed almost 28 percent of the total work force. Assuming that the N.F.I.B. survey results can be extrapolated to the broader small-business population*, 22 percent of 28 percent is 6 percent. That means that, according to the N.F.I.B. survey, the share of the total work force that might be affected by the increase in tax rates is around 6 percent, not 25 percent.
(Interestingly, in an interview for this post, an N.F.I.B. tax lawyer, Chris Whitcomb, seemed to back away from the claim that most of the small businesses likely to face the tax cut are those that employ 20 to 250 workers. Referring to the passage in the N.F.I.B.'s letter to Congress that cited the survey, Mr. Whitcomb said, "All that statement is saying is that looking at this survey data, of businesses that have 20 to 249 employees, 22 percent of those have a business income above $250,000. The conclusion that we're drawing from that is that this group will be disproportionately impacted by raising those rates.")
As for Mr. Romney's suggestion that the tax increase will affect companies employing half of the people who work at small businesses, that also is not accurate. In 2007, according to the Census data, companies with 20 to 299 employees employed 55 percent of the total work force at companies with fewer than 500 workers, a common definition for a small business. But given the N.F.I.B. survey's finding that only 22 percent of businesses in roughly that size range would actually face a tax increase, those businesses' share of the small-business work force would be only about 12 percent.
Mr. Romney's larger point is that the 4 percent increase in taxes on small businesses making more than $250,000 a year will cause these profitable companies to cut jobs - 700,000 employees in all, he said. For this assertion, Mr.Romney again relies on the N.F.I.B., and a recent analysis by the accounting firm Ernst & Young, commissioned jointly by the Independent Community Bankers of America, the N.F.I.B., the S Corporation Association, and the United States Chamber of Commerce. The analysis does indeed claim that raising taxes on those making more than $250,000 will cost the economy 710,000 jobs.
But the effect of taxes on investment (and, hence, on hiring) is hotly contested along ideological lines. (The Agenda discussed this earlier this year when the Buffett Rule was the subject of conversation.) Liberal economists see little, if any, effect from taxes on investment. Conservatives see a substantial effect, but even some conservative economists acknowledge that it is impossible to prove the connection using economic data given all of the other variables at work in the economy. Instead, they sometimes make their case on theoretical, or even visceral, terms. Or they publish analyses like the one from Ernst & Young, which is not an empirical study, using real-world data, but one making predictions based on the authors' assumptions about the relationship between taxes and investment. The authors of the Ernst & Young report are established conservative economists and the paper relies heavily on the work of other Republican-affiliated economists.
Not surprisingly, liberal economists dismiss it. The study's authors "get a considerably larger employment response from high-income tax cuts than other standard models or, more importantly, historical experience," Jared Bernstein, a former adviser to Vice President Joseph Biden, told The Agenda. (Mr. Bernstein also criticized the report in an August blog post.)
That critique won't find a sympathetic ear in the Romney campaign. After the debate, Paul Ryan, Mr. Romney's running mate, mentioned the 700,000 jobs that could be expected to be lost in a speech in Virginia. And it seems likely to come up again in the vice presidential debate Thursday night.
*The N.F.I.B. survey, conducted by Gallup in December 2007 and January 2008, interviewed only 154 businesses with 20 to 249 employees, which statisticians would consider a small sample. The businesses in the survey were randomly selected from Dun & Bradstreet lists.

HEADLINE: Self-Interest Leads to Collapse of BAE-EADS Merger

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: The proposed merger of two European defense and aerospace giants was a marriage not made in heaven, as one editorial commented on Thursday. But does the collapse of the deal send a broader message about the prospect of tighter European integration? 

 BODY:
LONDON - So much for European integration.
The collapse of a megamerger that would have created the biggest defense and aerospace company in the world has bolstered the view that the self-interest of European states will invariably trump their desire for closer cooperation.
Germany received most of the blame for stopping an attempt to fuse BAE of Britain with European Aeronautic Defense & Space, or EADS. The (EURO)35 billion, or $45 billion, deal would have created a European giant to rival Boeing.
A German veto of the deal allowed the governments of France and Britain to point the finger at Berlin, but the plan that collapsed Wednesday had provoked opposition in those countries for its perceived impact on national sovereignty and local jobs.
As my colleagues Mark Scott and Nicola Clark wrote in the DealBook blog:
"At a time when unity among European governments has been of critical importance as the Continent grapples with its debt crisis, the failure of the deal exposed how competing national considerations can get in the way of cross-border cooperation."
The German magazine Der Spiegel said the blame game among Britain, Germany and France had only just begun. 
The magazine said some people in the German government were concerned the merger might threaten the country's lead in top aerospace technologies. But Britain was also worried that giving European governments a big a say in the merged company might drive away business from the United States and Asia.
In France, where official and private investors were putting the blame firmly on the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, L'Express noted that the proposed merger had faced obstacles from the start.
"France wanted to protect jobs, Germany wanted to preserve Franco-German parity, and Britain wanted the new company to be largely free of government control," the magazine said.
In Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron faced opposition in his Conservative Party from those who feared the deal would cost British jobs, dilute a strategic asset in the shape of BAE and allow the French government to be the dominant force in the new company.
According to The Guardian: "The U.K. and French governments also harbored concerns about the transaction to the extent that every workable solution drew an objection from one of the three governments."
France and Britain appeared prepared to resolve differences over the size of government stakes in the proposed merger. But both balked at German demands to put the headquarters of the new company in Munich.
Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, a former German defense minister, lamented that a historic opportunity had foundered on opposition from Berlin.
"This is an unfortunate and rather surprising outcome," he wrote in The Financial Times, "not least because it is Germany that has continuously stressed the need for closer European integration and co-operation, not only in economic and financial affairs but also in the realm of security and defense."
For François Heisbourg of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the collapse of the merger was another sign of Germany's disaffection with Europe.
Another, big sign of German disaffection with Europe. EADS-BAE deal Called Off: EADS Blames Germany spon.de/adL2i via @spiegelonline
- François Heisbourg (@FHeisbourg) October 10, 2012
Gregory Viscusi noted in an analysis for Bloomberg Businessweek: "As Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has shown in almost three years of managing the euro area financial crisis, the interests of German taxpayers trump strategic designs."

HEADLINE: Icahn Bids to Take Control of Oshkosh Truck

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Carl C. Icahn escalated his proxy fight with the vehicle maker Oshkosh Corporation on Thursday by offering to take over the company for $32.50 a share, or about $3 billion.

The investor Carl C. Icahn es\x80\xAD
calated his proxy fight with the
vehicle maker Oshkosh Corpora\x80\xAD
tion on Thursday by offering to
take over the company for $32.50
a share, or about $3 billion.
The price represents a 21 per\x80\xAD
cent premium to Oshkosh's clos\x80\xAD
ing price on Wednesday. Mr.
Icahn, who has a roughly 10 per\x80\xAD
cent stake in Oshkosh, urged
shareholders to accept his bid.
"I strongly believe that Osh\x80\xAD
kosh needs proactive sharehold\x80\xAD
ers to bring a proactive manage\x80\xAD
ment team together to weather a
volatile economy," Mr. Icahn said
in a statement.
"Mismanagement of this com\x80\xADpany has resulted in a lost decadeof shareholder value," he added.Shares of the company, whichis based in Oshkosh, Wis., rosemore than 11 percent on Thurs\x80\xADday to close at $29.90.The tender offer is conditionedon Mr. Icahn's nominees beingelected to Oshkosh's board at thenext shareholder meeting earlynext year. Mr. Icahn said that if 40.1 percent of shares accept theoffer, bringing his stake to morethan 50 percent, he will seek toreschedule the meeting sooner.Mr. Icahn tried to elect six di\x80\xADrectors to Oshkosh's board at thelast shareholder meeting in Janu\x80\xADary, but failed, Oshkosh noted ina statement on Thursday.Oshkosh advised shareholdersto take no action in response tothe offer. The board plans to an\x80\xADnounce its position within 10 busi\x80\xADness days after the offer is offi\x80\xADcial.Mr. Icahn has argued that Osh\x80\xADkosh is weighed down by JLG In\x80\xADdustries, which it bought in 2006.JLG, which makes constructionequipment like scissor lifts andbooms, should be spun off, Mr.Icahn said Thursday. After the offer was announced,analysts speculated that Mr.Icahn may want to combine Osh\x80\xADkosh with another truck maker,Navistar International. Mr. Icahnhas also been pushing forchanges at Navistar, and thecompany agreed this week to in\x80\xADstall three of his nominees on itsboard.But Mr. Icahn dismissed thattalk."There's no interest on my partto see them get together," he saidin an interview.Shareholders of Oshkosh willhave 45 days to accept Mr.Icahn's offer once it is formal. Butthat deadline will probably be ex\x80\xADtended if Mr. Icahn's plan re\x80\xADceives strong support.

HEADLINE: Vice Presidential Debate Preview

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: What Paul Ryan might say, and how Joe Biden should respond. 

 BODY:
Vice President Biden has a relatively simple task -- to describe, anyway -- at tonight's Vice Presidential debate. He needs to respond to all the lies and half-truths that Mitt Romney tossed at President Obama at last week's debate, to which Mr. Obama did not respond. And he needs to remind voters that despite Mr. Romney's recent attempts to seem moderate, the Romney/Ryan ticket is severely conservative.
Unlike Mr. Romney, Paul Ryan doesn't even pretend to be a centrist. He tries to look young and modern (an iPod playlist that begins with the 1980s and ends with the 1970s and those workout pictures in Time) but Mr. Ryan represents a reactionary ideology. Mr. Ryan was chosen because he is a Tea Party darling.
Judging from a stump speech he gave in Ohio on Monday, here's what Mr. Ryan might say tonight, and here's what Mr. Biden ought to say in response.

Ryan:The unemployment rate is in double digits.
Biden:You and Mr. Romney spent a lot of time talking about how Mr. Obama has not been able to get unemployment below 8 percent, but ever since it did get below 8 percent, you've been talking about the "real unemployment rate," which is higher. You know and I know that politicians only cite that figure when it suits a rhetorical purpose. Regardless, without Mr. Obama's stimulus, both rates would be higher still.
Ryan:Mitt Romney will help veterans.
Biden: Mr. Romney opposed the withdrawal from Iraq, where many thousands of Americans were killed and maimed and is very squishy on Afghanistan. He says he will listen to the generals about a timetable for withdrawal, but it is the generals who are writing that timetable. What exactly would Mr. Romney have done differently in Afghanistan?
Ryan: We can't afford these devastating defense cuts that the president is promising.
Biden: You and Mr. Romney keep repeating that line, but Mr. Obama is not proposing devastating cuts. The looming cuts were required by the deal that Republicans demanded to end the phony debt ceiling crisis. You should know, because you voted for that deal.
Ryan: The stimulus was spent on "friends" and "cronies" and "special interest groups."
Biden:Do you include the automobile industry, which you and Mr. Romney opposed saving?
Ryan: If you want to see what Democratic policies will do to America, take a look at Europe.
Biden: Let's do that, because Europe isn't a poster child for Democratic policies, it's a poster child for austerity of the sort that you and Mr. Romney support. Greece, Spain and Italy have all tried austerity. Their unemployment rates are far higher than ours.

 10:42 A.M. | Fact Check: An 'Aggressive' Timeline for Afghanistan 
Mr. Biden said that the troop withdrawal schedule President Obama had established for Afghanistan was fully supported by Joint Chiefs of Staff. But there was some concern among top generals.
General David Petraeus, who was the commander in Afghanistan, at the time, told Congress that he would have preferred a slower withdrawal timetable so that American forces sent for the troop surge Mr. Obama ordered could have remained at peak strength for more of the fighting season. 
On June 22, 2011, General Petraeus said that the withdrawal schedule Mr. Obama picked "was a more aggressive formulation, if you will, in terms of the time line" than what he and Admiral Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs had recommended.
Admiral Mullen told Congress that "the President's decisions are more aggressive and incur more risk than I was originally prepared to accept. More force for more time is, without doubt, the safer course. But that does not necessarily make it the best course. Only the President, in the end, can really determine the acceptable level of risk we must take."
- Michael Gordon 
 10:23 A.M. | Fact Check: 20 Million People to Lose Coverage? 
Mr. Ryan said that according to the Congressional Budget Office, up to 20 million people are projected to "lose their health care" when President Obama's health care law goes into effect. Mr. Ryan was going out on a limb. 
He was referring to a report the nonpartisan budget office put out in March on how the law would affect the number of people getting health insurance through their employer. But the report's baseline estimate was that between three and five million fewer people, net, would get coverage through their job each year from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case under prior law. And the report said that some of those people would choose to stop getting insurance through their employer, to take advantage of new federal subsidies that will help people with incomes up to four times the poverty level buy private insurance through new state- or federally-run marketplaces called exchanges.
The baseline projections in the report assume that many others, even if their employer stopped offering coverage due to the law, would also qualify for the new subsidies or for Medicaid, which will expand to cover more low-income people.
The report did predict that as many as 20 million fewer people could get employer-sponsored insurance under the law. But it was the most drastic of four possible scenarios it predicted, based on a range of assumptions. The assumptions used to arrive at the estimate of 20 million "have only rarely been reported in the research literature," according to the report.
In another scenario, the report predicted a net gain of three million people with employer-sponsored insurance as a result of the law. The other scenarios predicted declines of 10 million and 12 million people with employer-sponsored coverage.
Overall, the report said, the number of uninsured people is projected to drop by 29 million by 2019 due to the law.

 10:20 A.M. | Fact Check: Religious Institutions' and Contraception 
Mr. Romney has portrayed as an attack on religious freedom a provision of Mr. Obama's health care law requiring most insurance plans offered by employers to include free birth control coverage. One Romney ad accuses Mr. Obama of using the law "to declare war on religion, forcing religious institutions to go against their faith."
From the start, churches and other houses of worship were exempt from the contraceptive requirement. Still, it provoked furious criticism from Roman Catholic institutions and some other religious groups. The administration ultimately offered what Mr. Obama described as "an accommodation" for church-affiliated schools, universities, hospitals and charities. They would not have to provide or pay for contraceptive coverage, but their female employees from their insurance companies at no cost.
Mr. Romney supported a subsequent Republican effort, known as the Blunt amendment, to let employers and health insurance companies deny coverage for contraceptives and other items they object to on religious or moral grounds. But the Senate in March narrowly voted to kill the effort. 
Mr. Romney has said he would abolish the contraceptive coverage requirement.
- Abby Goodnough 
 10:17 A.M. | Fact Check: Biden Blurs Voting Record on Spending 
When Mr. Biden itemized a number of actions the Bush administration took with Mr. Ryan's support that added to the debt, he blurred his own record at the time in the Senate, giving the misleading impression that he had voted against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which he supported.
"And, by the way, they talk about this Great Recession as if it fell out of the sky, like, 'Oh, my goodness, where did it come from?' " Mr. Biden said at the debate. "It came from this man voting to put two wars on a credit card, to at the same time put a prescription drug benefit on the credit card, a trillion-dollar tax cut for the very wealthy. I was there. I voted against them. I said, no, we can't afford that. And now, all of a sudden, these guys are so seized with the concern about the debt that they created." 
 Mr. Biden did vote against the Bush tax cuts in both 2001 and 2003. And while he voted for an initial version of the Medicare drug benefit, he voted against the final bill. 
 But Mr. Biden did vote to authorize President Bush to use force against Iraq, and he voted during the week of the Sept. 11 attacks to give the president "all necessary and appropriate force" to respond to the terror attacks.

 0:07 A.M. | Fact Check: Positions on Abortion 
Mr. Ryan said Thursday that the Democratic Party supported abortion "without restriction and with taxpayer funding'' under the health care law signed by President Obama in 2010.
Under the law, health insurance plans are generally allowed to cover abortion. If they cover the procedure, they cannot use federal money to pay for it. People who enroll in such plans will generally have to make separate payments - - one for abortion coverage and one for everything else - - and insurers must keep the money in separate accounts.
Starting in 2014, the federal government will spend tens of billions of dollars subsidizing comprehensive health insurance for low- and moderate-income people. Opponents of abortion say that while the government will not directly pay for abortion, it will subsidize some insurance plans that provide coverage for abortion services.
In nearly 14 years as a Republican congressman from Wisconsin, Mr. Ryan has been an ardent, unwavering foe of abortion rights and has tried to cut off federal money for family planning.
In the debate Thursday, Mr. Ryan said, "The policy of a Romney administration is to oppose abortion with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.'' He suggested that decisions on the legality of abortion should be made by Congress, not courts.
"We don't think that unelected judges should make this decision,'' Mr. Ryan said. Rather, he said, "people, through their elected representatives and reaching a consensus in society through the democratic process, should make this determination.''
In an interview with the conservative Weekly Standard in 2010, Mr. Ryan said, "I'm as pro-life as a person gets.'' 
He has voted for legislation that would cut off federal money for Planned Parenthood and the Title X family planning program and establish criminal penalties for certain doctors who perform the procedure known as partial birth abortion.
He is a co-sponsor of a bill that would define fetuses as persons entitled to full protection under the law. 
The bill declares, "The life of each human being begins with fertilization, cloning or its functional equivalent, irrespective of sex, health, function or disability, defect, stage of biological development or condition of dependency, at which time every human being shall have all the legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of personhood.''
The concept of personhood is a fundamental tenet of the anti-abortion movement.
Like most Republicans, Mr. Ryan has strenuously opposed the new health care law. He has criticized Mr. Obama's efforts to guarantee free insurance coverage of contraceptives for women, including those employed by Roman Catholic hospitals, universities and social service agencies.
In the debate, Mr. Ryan said the administration was "assaulting the religious liberties of this country'' through such policies.
"They're infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of religion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches, Catholic hospitals,'' Mr. Ryan said. "Our church should not have to sue our federal government to maintain their religious liberties.''
The 2010 health care law requires most insurers to cover preventive services without co-payments or deductibles. Under the administration policy, most health plans must cover birth control for women - - all contraceptive drugs and devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration - - as well as sterilization procedures. 
Church-affiliated universities, hospitals and charities would not have to provide or pay for such coverage. Instead, the White House says, coverage for birth control could be offered to women directly by their employers' insurance companies, "with no role for religious employers who oppose contraception.''
The administration has not said exactly how such arrangements would work for church-affiliated employers that serve as their own insurers.
Mr. Biden defended the administration's approach.
"With regard to the assault on the Catholic Church,'' Mr. Biden said, "let me make it absolutely clear. No religious institution, Catholic or otherwise, including Catholic Social Services, Georgetown Hospital, Mercy - any hospital - none has to either refer contraception. None has to pay for contraception. None has to be a vehicle to get contraception in any insurance policy they provide.''

 11:08 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney's Bipartisan Record 
Seeking a contrast to Mr. Obama's difficulties in dealing with Republican legislators, Mr. Ryan said that as Massachusetts governor, Mr. Romney "found common ground" with a legislature that was 87 percent Democratic, meeting each week with Democratic leaders. The result, he said, was a state budget that was balanced each year without tax increases.
Mr. Romney did sometimes worked with the Democratic legislature as governor, particularly in the last 18 months of his term, when he won approval of a version of his plan for universal health insurance. And the two sides did agree in his first year in office to cut $1.6 billion from the Massachusetts budget in the face of a revenue crisis triggered by the collapse of the dot-com boom.
The state did balance its budget during Mr. Romney's term, as Mr. Ryan said. But as most people understand it, that achievement did not come without tax increases. By closing what Mr. Romney called business "tax loopholes" - in effect, increasing tax liabilities - the state raised an addition $375 million annually, according to the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. Mr. Romney's administration also raised another $375 million a year by increasing a bevy of fees on state services.
But beyond that, independent observers say, Mr. Romney's bipartisan achievements were sparse, and his relations with the legislature frequently distant and acrimonious.
Bipartisanship "worked out extremely well on his signature issue, health care," said Peter Ubertaccio, a scholar of Massachusetts politics who heads the political science department at Stonehill College in Easton, Mass. "But if you look at his willingness to go to the other, side, to listen to them, embrace them challenge them to come up with a bill, he approached much of his policymaking as a chief executive with little in the way of results."
He and others say Mr. Romney had little patience with the horse-trading and backslapping of Massachusetts politics, and disdained the personal cultivating of rank-and-file legislators that bred good will. He opened his four-year term in 2003 by vetoing the Democratic leadership's plan to create new committees and raise salaries of some chairmen. The legislature rejected outright the keystone of his legislative agenda, a sweeping overhaul of state government and the public university system.
That was but the start of a slide in relations, said Jeffrey Berry, a Tufts University expert on state politics. In 2004, Mr. Romney mounted a $3 million election campaign to unseat Democratic legislators, employing a direct-mail barrage which, among other things, implied that some Democrats had cast a vote that would hinder the tracking of convicted pedophiles. When Democrats protested, Republicans replied that they had employed similarly aggressive tactics.
By the end of that year, The Boston Globe reported, House Speaker Salvatore DiMasi was drawing laughs by noting that Mr. Romney had hugged him after his swearing-in - and that Mr DiMasi wound up with frostbite. (Some former Romney aides called Mr. DiMasi the legislature's main obstructionist, saying he played a crucial role in blocking the governor's legislative efforts in 2005 and 2006.)
By the end of his four years, most of Mr. Romney's major initiatives, including pension reform, reinstating the death penalty, education reform and reorganizing the state transportation department, had failed to pass.
In the first presidential debate, Mr. Romney cited weekly meetings with House and Senate Democratic leaders as evidence of his success in building bridges to Democratic lawmakers. Those meetings were fairly common during his first years in office. But they grew more sporadic as his term lengthened. By 2006 - when Mr. Romney was out of the state for all or part of 219 days, campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination - they became rare events.

 11:15 P.M. | Fact Check: When Would Romney Leave Afghanistan? 
Vice President Biden sought to suggest that a Romney administration might keep troops in Afghanistan indefinitely. "With regard to Afghanistan, he [Mr. Obama] said he would end the war in 2014," Mr. Biden said. "Governor Romney said we should not set a date, No. 1, and No. 2, with regard to 2014, it depends." Is Mr. Biden right?
Mr. Ryan said that Mr. Romney embraced the 2014 timeline for troop withdrawals. Mr. Ryan also said, "We don't want to lose the gains we've gotten" - but he did not precisely explain how a Romney administration would do this better than the Obama administration.
 Mr. Romney's exact position on troop withdrawals has, at times, been unclear, and that has opened him up to attacks that he might keep regular infantry troops there longer, compared with the Obama administration's pledge to remove all regular combat troops by 2014.
While Mr. Romney has for some time broadly embraced the same 2014 timeline, he has often qualified the timeline by saying that he would first seek advice from commanders on the ground, which his critics say has been a way to leave himself wiggle room to leave combat troops in Afghanistan after 2014.
 This week, a Romney official did not specifically answer a question about whether Mr. Romney has ruled out keeping regular combat brigades in Afghanistan after 2014, as opposed to keeping a small contingent of military trainers and special operations forces after that date, as the White House has spoken of doing. 
 Mr. Romney and other Republicans have accused Mr. Obama of undermining the war effort in Afghanistan by setting timelines for troop withdrawals, thus giving the Taliban incentive to wait things out, and Mr. Ryan repeated this attack at the debate, saying, "We don't want to embolden our enemies to hold and wait out for us."
 But troop withdrawal timelines are an issue that underscores a problem Mr. Romney has often faced this campaign: Trying to draw a distinction with Mr. Obama on foreign policy while having a hard time articulating specific policy disagreements. Mr. Romney said in his Oct. 8 foreign policy speech that he "will pursue a real and successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014," adding that he would "weigh the best advice" of commanders.
 But critics say Mr. Romney's own embrace of the 2014 timeline has undermined his major criticism - that Mr. Obama's timelines are wrong because they embolden the Taliban. One of Mr. Romney's advisers, Dan Senor, speaking on Fox News, referred to bringing troops home in 2014 by saying, "In that respect, our position is the same as the president's." 
The Fox News host, Bret Baier, responded incredulously, "But aren't you saying that that's exactly the same - it's a calendar date on the page that gives the Taliban a date that they are going to step in?"
 Analysts say Mr. Romney has little choice but to back the Obama-NATO timeline: Despite the more hawkish language, Mr. Romney could not risk facing charges that he wants to extend an unpopular - and in the view of many experts - unwinnable war.
- Richard A. Oppel Jr. 
 10:58 P.M. | Fact Check: Did Obama Apologize for American Values? 
Mr. Ryan suggested that Mr. Obama has apologized for American values, similar to repeated assertions made by Republicans that the president went on an "apology tour" after his inauguration, or that he has sought to apologize for American principles. "What we should not be apologizing for is standing up for our values," Mr. Ryan said at the debate. Are those charges correct?
The claim of Mr. Obama apologizing for American values has been repeatedly found to be inaccurate: While Mr. Obama has acknowledged American failings at times - and, like his predecessor, George W. Bush, has on at least one occasion apologized for a specific act of American wrongdoing abroad - he has never explicitly apologized for American values or diplomacy.
Nevertheless, this notion has been a reliable attack line at Romney campaign events. Republicans have sought to use a number of excerpts from Mr. Obama's speeches or interviews to make their case. One of the most commonly used is a 2009 speech in France in which Mr. Obama said that "there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive." Critics typically ignore what Mr. Obama said next: "But in Europe, there is an anti-Americanism that is at once casual but can also be insidious. Instead of recognizing the good that America so often does in the world, there have been times where Europeans choose to blame America for much of what's bad."
In February, Mr. Obama did apologize to the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, after American military personnel were involved in burning copies of the Koran, an episode that spawned violence throughout Afghanistan. But his expression of regret came after Marine Gen. John R. Allen, the American commander in Afghanistan, had already apologized. It also brought to mind the apology then-President Bush made in 2004 to King Abdullah of Jordan for abuses at Abu Ghraib prison.
In an interview in February with Fox News, Mr. Romney seemed to object to the Koran-burning apology, saying, "For us to be apologizing at a time like this is something which is very difficult for the American people to countenance."
But Mr. Ryan expressed a somewhat different view. Asked during the debate whether the United States should have apologized "for Americans burning Korans in Afghanistan, should the U.S. apologize for U.S. Marines urinating on Taliban corpses?" Mr. Ryan responded: "Oh gosh yes. Urinating on Taliban corpses?"
- Richard A. Oppel Jr. 
 10:45 P.M. | Candidates Save Their Best Arguments for the End 
The two candidates gave their best closing statements before the real ones.
Asked by Ms. Raddatz what they would say to a military hero about the tone of the political campaign, Mr. Biden and Mr. Ryan both offered heart-felt answers that got to the root of their campaigns.
Mr. Biden said he would ask the hero about which presidential candidate would be more likely to help the middle class recover from a devastating economic collapse.
"Whether or not Governor Romney or President Obama has the conviction to help lift up the middle class, help restore them to where they were when this great recession hit," Mr. Biden said.
He said he would tell the hero to "take a look at whether the president of the United States has acted wisely in the use of force," and he compared that to what he called "slipshod comments" about foreign policy from Mr. Romney.
Mr. Ryan offered a crisp summation of his critique of Mr. Obama's tenure in office, perhaps stealing from his closing statement.
He said Mr. Obama had left Americans with a "string of broken promises" on health care, taxes and the deficit. On the debt crisis, he accused the president of failing to provide a real budget plan.
"The president likes to say he's got a plan. He gave a speech," Mr. Ryan said. "You see, that's what we get in this administration. Speeches. What we need is leadership."
- Michael D. Shear 
 10:40 P.M. | Issue of Abortion Raised In Answers on Faith 
If there was one subject that hard-core Democrats wanted raised, it was abortion and contraception. Mr. Biden did not disappoint.
Prompted by a question about the Roman Catholic faith of both men, Mr. Biden warned that a Republican administration would appoint a Supreme Court justice who would overturn Roe v. Wade, the case that made abortion legal.
"Just ask yourself, with Robert Bork being the chief adviser on the court for Mr. Romney," Mr. Biden said, "who is he likely to appoint? You think he's likely to appoint someone like Scalia?"
Mr. Ryan said that he personally believed that "life begins at conception," but said that the policy of a Romney administration would be to oppose abortion except in the case of rape, incest or the life of the mother.
Mr. Ryan accused Mr. Obama's administration of trying to force religious institutions to pay for contraception, a charge that Mr. Biden rejected as wrong.
And Mr. Ryan said that the Republican ticket did not "think that unelected judges should make this decision."
- Michael D. Shear 
 10:40 P.M. | Fact Check: Would Ryan Budget Slash Early Education? 
Mr. Biden charged that Mr. Ryan's budget, which was passed by Republicans in the House, would have cut early childhood education for 200,000 children. Is that accurate?
 Mr. Ryan's plan did call for major spending cuts and would undoubtedly cut education spending - but it did not specify exactly which programs would be cut or by how much. Democrats have based their estimates of its impact on the assumption that the cuts would be spread evenly across the board, an approach Republicans say they would not take.
So what might the effects be? Arne Duncan, the secretary of education, testified earlier this year that Mr. Ryan's budget could have "disastrous consequences for America's children."
Mr. Duncan estimated that that the Ryan budget could reduce spending on education for low-income, minority, rural and tribal children by $2.7 billion in 2014. He said that could affect 9,000 schools serving more than 3.8 million students, and jeopardize the jobs of as up to 38,000 teachers and aides. He said that aid to help students with disabilities could face $2.2 billion in cuts, which he said would translate to the loss of nearly 30,000 special education teachers, aides and other staff. And he said that some 200,000 children could lose access to Head Start.
Republicans have said that while the budget calls for steep spending cuts, it does not specify them. Mr. Ryan himself has often questioned whether federal spending translates to better results. "Stagnant student achievement levels and exploding deficits have demonstrated that massive amounts of federal funding and top-down interventions are not the way to provide America's students with a high-quality education," he said in a statement on his Web site.
- Michael Cooper 
 10:33 P.M. | Fact Check: Troops on the Ground in Syria? 
Mr. Ryan ruled out putting troops on the ground in Syria unless it "is in the national interest of the American people." How much did that diverge from what the administration says?
Mr. Ryan essentially put himself in a place pretty close to where President Obama and Mr. Biden have been: that America's options are limited if putting ground troops into the country is off the table.
The essence of the Ryan argument was that the Obama administration had acted too slowly and given Russia a veto at the United Nations. But that veto - which the Russians possess as a member of the Security Council - wasn't about taking military action against Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president who is clinging to power. It was about sanctions.
So in the end, the two men, while emphasizing their differences, seemed to come out in the same place: the only event that would prompt America to go into Syria would be the need to secure its chemical weapons stockpiles. Anything short of that was not worth the risks.
- David E. Sanger 
 10:27 P.M. | Fact Check: American Troops Out of Afghanistan in 2014? 
Mr. Biden could not be more emphatic: By the end of 2014 all Americans will be out of Afghanistan. He said it, then said it again, insisting it is "the responsibility of the Afghans" to secure their own country. Was he accurate?
Well, sort of.
What Mr. Biden was skipping over was the administration's plan for an "enduring presence" of 10,000 to 15,000 troops - mostly behind the high walls of military bases - to act as a tripwire to keep the Taliban from taking Kabul, and to keep an eye on Pakistan.
The enduring presence has not been agreed to yet by the Afghan government, but the administration believes that President Karzai will have little choice, because his own forces will need backup. But the reality is that the American presence is as much focused on Pakistan, and its nuclear stockpile, as it is on Afghanistan. From the base in Afghanistan, the United States would keep bomb search teams, drone operators and special forces.
- David E. Sanger 
 10:27 P.M. | Debate Pace a Function of Format? 
If the presidential debate in Denver last week lacked much in the way of fireworks between the candidates, the vice-presidential debate in Kentucky more than made up for it. 
One contributing factor could have been the change in format. The first debate, which was divided into six 15-minute blocks, allowed for longer, more stump speech-like answers, fewer opportunities for the moderator to interject and less interaction between the candidates. Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney stood far apart on the stage, each behind his own lectern.
The vice-presidential debate, however, was divided up into nine 10-minute segments. The pace was noticeably quicker, and the confrontations between the candidates sharper. Mr. Biden and Mr. Ryan sat just an arm's length from each other at a table.
Ms. Raddatz, who moderated the debate, seemed to use her close proximity to the candidates to her advantage. She kept them - mostly - from running over their allotted two-minute responses. And she was able to interrupt without having them ignore her. 
The presidential debate next week will provide a format that should move even faster. It will be a town hall-style meeting in which audience members ask questions. The candidates will each have two minutes to respond. Then the moderator, CNN's Candy Crowley, will have one additional minute to facilitate a discussion.
For the final debate on Oct. 22, the format will be the same as the first one.
- Jeremy W. Peters 
 10:21 P.M. | Foreign Policy, Front and Center 
There may not have been as substantive a debate about foreign policy in the entire 2012 campaign as is taking place here.
Mr. Biden and Mr. Ryan are both engaging in a substantive, heated discussion about Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq. 
Mr. Ryan accused the Obama administration of "outsourcing" its foreign policy to the United Nations and of letting Russia veto American actions.
Mr. Biden accused Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney of "loose talk" in Syria and challenged Mr. Ryan to explain whether he and his running mate support a ground war in Syria.
"What more would they do other than put American boots on the ground?" he asked. "The last thing America needs is to get involved in another ground war in the Middle East."
When Mr. Ryan declined to directly answer the question, Mr. Biden said: "What would my friend do differently? You notice how he never answers the question."
- Michael D. Shear 
 10:21 P.M. | Fact Check: Would Romney Military Plan Add $2 Trillion? 
During a rapid-fire exchange of talking points on defense spending, Mr. Biden argued that the Romney-Ryan military spending plans would add $2 trillion to the budget and that the military itself does not want many of the items in question at a time the nation simply cannot afford all of them.
Mr. Ryan rebutted the $2 trillion price tag and said that, first of all, a Romney administration would not cut the defense budget by $1 trillion.
He seems to have gotten that number by adding together the $450 billion-plus defense spending cuts proposed by the Obama administration over the next decade and the approximately $500 billion in cuts that would be required if Congress fails to reach a budget accord.
But that second cut, under a program called sequestration, has not happened yet - and both Democrats and Republicans are trying to avoid it.
Looking at Mr. Romney's proposals - more warships, more air wings, a more expanded military presence around the world - shows that they could cost $2 trillion, or maybe not.
Here's why any exact price tag is hard to calculate. Mr. Romney has pledged, for example, that as president he would build 15 new warships per year. But even the candidate's top national security advisers say they have not worked out the exact mix of warships they would build among a shopping list of littoral combat ships, destroyers, submarines and so on.
It is impossible to state with certainty the cost of 15 anything - bicycles, books, bottles of fruit juice - unless you knew exactly what 15 you are buying.
And the discussion among Romney advisers about the possibility of ordering up a new class of frigate not even on the drawing board yet injects a potential purchase that simply has no price tag today. The vagueness is both a help and a hindrance to the Romney campaign
Mr. Ryan also repeated a statement that the American Navy is the smallest in almost a century.
True, today's Navy is much smaller than in past generations. But Navy commanders also point out that each individual warship at sea today is far more capable than any individual predecessor in that class of vessel.

 10:22 P.M. | Fact Check: Waste and the Stimulus 
Did the $787 billion stimulus package, overseen by Mr. Biden, suffer from waste and fraud, as Mr. Ryan contended?
Mr. Ryan charged that the stimulus, which Mr. Biden oversaw and was sometimes described as the "sheriff" of, was plagued by waste. But while there was plenty of second-guessing about some of the uses that the $787 billion stimulus was put to, very little of the money was lost to outright criminal fraud, according to government officials. 
Michael Wood, the executive director of the Recovery Board, which oversaw the spending, said in a statement last month that out of the $276 billion that the stimulus allocated for contracts, grants and loans to tens of thousands of recipients, officials had documented only $11.1 million lost to fraud. He said that the 29 inspectors general with oversight responsibility had more than 1,900 investigations under way, and that 598 had resulted in convictions and judgments.
"For a program with so much money in the pipeline," he wrote, "the fraud numbers are surprisingly low."
When the first chairman of the Recovery Board, Earl Devaney, retired at the end of 2011, Representative Darrell Issa, the California Republican who is the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, issued a statement praising his tenure. 
"As chairman of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, he has introduced innovative techniques to combat waste, fraud and mismanagement,'' Mr. Issa said in the statement. "I strongly believe the Devaney Model is the future of protecting taxpayer dollars and must be applied to all federal spending."

 10:15 P.M. | Fact Check: A Failure to Safeguard the Libyan Mission? 
The debate started with the moderator, Martha Raddatz, focusing on the terrorist attacks last month in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans on Sept. 11. "Wasn't this a massive intelligence failure, Vice President Biden?" Ms. Raddatz asked.
Mr. Biden did not answer the question. Instead, he mourned the loss of the Americans and vowed that the government would "get to the bottom of it."
Republicans have singled out Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador to the United Nations, for criticism, and Mr. Ryan continued that critique. On Sept. 16, Ms. Rice said that the attack on the compound in Benghazi began with the angry protest about an anti-Islamic film that was "hijacked" by extremists. It was not until three days later that Matthew G. Olsen, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, became the first administration official to call the assault a terrorist attack.
Ms. Rice said she was using information provided to her by American intelligence agencies, a defense Mr. Biden repeated here. 
"The intelligence community told us that," Mr. Biden said. "As they learned more facts about exactly what happened, they changed their assessment."
That is, indeed, what the office of the Director of National Intelligence said on Sept. 28 - that the assessment had changed with new information. 
But in the hours after the Benghazi attack, American officials have said, spy agencies intercepted electronic communications from fighters from Ansar al-Shariah, a local extremist group, who began bragging to an operative with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the terror group's North African franchise. Another intercept captured cellphone conversations by militants on the grounds of the smoldering American mission that suggested links to, or sympathies for, the regional Qaeda group. 
Republicans have pointed to this information as evidence that American officials suspected the involvement of the Qaeda franchise much earlier than the administration publicly acknowledged.
Mr. Romney has criticized the Obama administration for initially playing down Al Qaeda's possible connection to the attacks last month in Benghazi, but some of his own statements on the assault have been misleading.
In a major foreign policy address on Monday, Mr. Romney said the attack was "likely the work of forces affiliated with those that attacked our homeland on Sept. 11, 2001." 
This suggests that Al Qaeda's leadership in Pakistan, which planned and carried out the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, was somehow responsible for the attack in Libya. That's misleading. American intelligence analysts now believe that some of the militants involved in the attack were linked to groups affiliated with, or sympathetic to Al Qaeda's franchise in North Africa, not the main Al Qaeda hierarchy.
In his speech on Monday, Mr. Romney was also imprecise in assessing the strength of Al Qaeda's global affiliates. He said the terrorist group "remains a strong force in Yemen and Somalia, in Libya and other parts of North Africa, in Iraq, and now in Syria."
While it is true that Qaeda franchises in those regions have been resurgent, the Qaeda-linked group in Somalia, Shabab, has suffered major territorial losses in the past year and the organization has influence through affiliated groups or individuals in Syria and Libya, not a dedicated presence of its own on the ground there.

 10:16 P.M. | Fact Check: Tax Increases on Small Businesses 
Would President Obama's plan to repeal income tax cuts for the highest-earning Americans kill jobs? Possibly, economists say, but the Clinton-era tax rates Mr. Obama wants to return to were responsible for creating millions of jobs.
Mr. Ryan, like his running mate, Mr. Romney, warned that Mr. Obama's plan to let the Bush-era income tax cuts for the highest-earning Americans expire could hurt small businesses. Mr. Biden countered that 97 percent of small businesses do not earn enough to be hit by the higher rates, a number borne out by the Joint Committee on Taxation of Congress. 
Mr. Obama wants to roll back the Bush tax cuts on income above $200,000 for individuals and income above $250,000 for households, raising the top marginal rate to 39.6 percent from 35 percent now. Some small businesses, which file taxes as "S corporations," would be hit by the higher rates, but the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that only 3 percent would earn enough to be hit by the new, higher top marginal rates. And not all of those businesses are exactly small: thousands of them would have receipts of more than $50 million a year, the committee found. The Romney campaign noted that those few businesses play an important role and said that they should not be burdened with higher taxes.
Of the businesses that would be subjected to the higher rates, many are sole proprietors - a classification so amorphous it can include everyone from corporate executives who earn income on rental property to entertainers, hedge fund managers and investment bankers.
Pluralities of likely voters and independent voters said in recent polls that they supported letting the Bush-era tax cuts on higher earners expire.
Would repealing those tax cuts kill jobs? Economists generally agree that raising taxes, and taking money that would otherwise cycle through the economy, can cost jobs; that is one of the reasons that Mr. Obama's stimulus plan included tax cuts. But it is worth noting that the rates Mr. Obama wants to return to were last seen during the Clinton administration - a time when the nation created more 22.7 million jobs, as the Romney campaign has noted.
- Michael Cooper 
 10:13 P.M. | Moderator Helps Set the Tone 
Ms. Raddatz is being much more aggressive than Mr. Lehrer was last week, and it has helped set the tone of the debate.
Among the criticisms that were leveled at the participants of the first presidential debate was the idea that Mr. Lehrer, the moderator, didn't press the candidates enough to explain themselves.
Ms. Raddatz has said she intended to let the candidates have exchanges with each other. But she also said she would press them, too.
She has.
On issues of taxes, Afghanistan and Iranian nuclear weapons, among others, she repeatedly asked follow-up questions of the two men, seeking explanations and clarifications.
About halfway through, she also has been more aggressive in enforcing timelines, interrupting long answers to move on to other subjects.
That approach has produced a faster-paced debate - though, to be fair to Mr. Lehrer, the candidates themselves were on fire Thursday night. So maybe the pace was set by them, not her.
- Michael D. Shear 
 10:10 P.M. | How Much Will Style Define the Debate? 
One of the big questions in the next 24 hours is whether this debate will be judged more on style than the detail of the exchanges. That is something the Obama campaign is worrying about - and the Romney campaign is hoping for - as this debate plays out.
Mr. Biden has repeatedly made the case against Mr. Ryan - and Mr. Romney - that Mr. Obama did not during last week's presidential debate. But substance aside, will Mr. Biden be scored for his style? Will his laughing, eye-rolling and interrupting be seen as too pushy, too aggressive, too disrespectful?
Democrats will certainly argue that is the worst kind of political analysis - style over substance. But as Al Gore can certainly attest, that often is the way debates are judged. And Republicans will surely push that line in the hours ahead.
Will it work? Mr. Biden is not running for president, so at least in theory, he can afford to sacrifice some likability in the service of firing up the Democratic base and putting into the political atmosphere the Democratic arguments that Mr. Obama failed to make last week.
- Adam Nagourney 
 10:08 P.M. | Fact Check: 100 Department of Energy Investigations? 
Mr. Ryan, in discussing the 2009 stimulus package, said that the Department of Energy's inspector general had initiated 100 criminal investigations involving fraud in the spending program, known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
The claim is based on statements from the agency's inspector general, Gregory Friedman, who told Congress last November that he had begun 100 such investigations into what he called "various schemes, including the submission of false information, claims for unallowable or unauthorized expenses and other improper uses of Recovery Act funds."
Mr. Friedman said that the investigations had led to five criminal prosecutions and recovery of more than $2.3 million.
According to an Associated Press account of his testimony, Mr. Friedman said the fraud was a result in part of the fact that very few "shovel ready" projects were available for government investment at the time the package was enacted. The Department of Energy received more than $35 billion in one-time funds and had no infrastructure and few people to oversee such a huge inflow, the inspector general said.
- John M. Broder 
 10:05 P.M. | Debate Highlights Differences, Especially on Taxes 
Anyone looking for a clash of philosophy found it in this debate, especially on taxes.
Mr. Biden angrily denounced the tax proposal forwarded by Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney, calling it an attack on the middle class.
"This is unconscionable," Mr. Biden said "The middle class got knocked on their heels. The great recession crushed them. They need some help now."
By contrast, he said, the Bush tax cuts on wealthy people should be allowed to expire.
Mr. Ryan offered a drastically different vision, saying that the Democratic approach would be an increase of tax rates on small businesses that would cost 700,000 jobs.
"There aren't enough rich people and small businesses to tax to pay for all their spending," Mr. Ryan said.
Turning to the camera, he said to viewers, "Watch out, middle class, the tax bill is coming to you."
The debate offered viewers a clear picture of the differences between the two campaigns - a difference that was at best muddled by the performance at the first debate between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney.
But the exchange was also less civil, with Mr. Biden and Mr. Ryan repeatedly interrupting each other. Mr. Biden was especially aggressive, offering retorts to just about every fact that Mr. Ryan tried to offer.
"Not mathematically possible," Mr. Biden repeatedly said to Mr. Ryan's claim about the Republican tax cut plan.
- Michael D. Shear 
 10:02 P.M. | Fact Check: Has Obama Been Inconsistent on Iran? 
"How are we going to prevent war?" Mr. Biden demanded at one point, after Mr. Ryan charged that the administration had been wildly inconsistent - vowing that Iran would never be permitted to get a weapon, then backtracking and saying that war with Iran would be a disaster. Here, both sides have the facts on their side.
Mr. Ryan is correct that the administration's language on the utility of a military attack has been all over the map. While officials routinely say "all options are on the table," at various points both Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and the chairman of the joint chiefs, Martin E. Dempsey, have said that an attack on Iran could drive the nuclear program further underground, and may set it back for only a while.
But Mr. Biden was right when he said that, while he couldn't go into classified data, "we feel quite confident" that the United States could deal a military blow to Iran's nuclear program. The question is how big a blow. 
Most experts say that only one weapon in the American arsenal, the Massive Ordinance Penetrator - a weapon the Israelis don't possess - could pierce the deep underground nuclear enrichment center at Fordow. That's the facility the United States and Israel are concerned about because it produces a form of uranium close to bomb grade.
Interestingly, both men agreed that they think there is more time available than Israel has suggested to deal with the problem - and that it cannot happen by next spring. Mr. Biden said that even if Iran had the nuclear fuel for a bomb, "we will know if they start the process of building a nuclear weapon." Perhaps the United States will, but such signals have been missed before.

 9:53 P.M. | Fact Check: Comparing Medicare Plans 
No program faces bigger changes under Mr. Ryan's budget than Medicare, the program providing health coverage for the elderly, and his plan to overhaul the program forms the basis in many respects for Mr. Romney's plan - and Mr. Biden just took it on head on.
Mr. Ryan's plan calls for reshaping the curren, government-sponsored defined benefit fee for service insurance system. Under his plan, which would begin a decade from now, each beneficiary would receive a fixed amount of money - Democrats call it a voucher - to purchase private insurance or buy into the existing government program. Under the most recent Ryan plan, the money, known as premium support, would rise each year by the growth of the economy, plus 0.5 percentage points, considerably slower than health care's current rate of inflation.
Mr. Ryan believes competition will drive down the cost of health care, keeping the voucher's value up to date. The Congressional Budget Office projected that over time, the value of the voucher would erode, shifting the extra costs to the elderly.
Critics also warn that under Mr. Ryan's plan, private insurers would try to sign up the healthiest seniors, leaving the sickest, most-expensive-to-cover elderly to enroll in the government program. That would boost the government's costs and steeply erode the value of those recipients' vouchers.
Mr. Biden noted that Mr. Romney's original Medicare plan would have cost future beneficiaries $6,400 in higher costs and questioned what his current plan would cost. But it is difficult to assess what Mr. Romney's plan would cost, because he has not released key details.
Unlike Mr. Ryan, who proposed capping the growth of premium support to the growth of the economy, plus 0.5 percentage points, Mr. Romney has not specified how much money he would give to future beneficiaries to buy coverage, or how fast it would grow - making the effects of his proposal difficult to assess.
The Romney campaign's policy director, Lanhee Chen, wrote that while higher-income seniors might be asked to pay more under Mr. Romney's plan, "all seniors will be guaranteed sufficient support because the support is actually set based on what plans will cost."
But the campaign has not said how its plan would work. A question and answer section of the campaign's Web site puts it this way: "How high will the premium support be? How quickly will it grow? Mitt continues to work on refining the details of his plan, and he is exploring different options for ensuring that future seniors receive the premium support they need while also ensuring that competitive pressures encourage providers to improve quality and control cost."
Mr. Romney has suggested keeping the growth of the subsidies below the rate of medical inflation in the past. He told the Washington Examiner last December that allowing the subsidies to grow at the rate of medical inflation "would have no particular impact on reining in the excessive cost of our entitlement program."
If his campaign's theory that increased competition among private plans will slow the growth of health care costs proves wrong, future beneficiaries could well face higher costs. (Mr. Romney's pledge to repeal Mr. Obama's health care law would also cost them more, because part of the law helps Medicare beneficiaries pay for prescription drugs by filing the so-called doughnut hole.) But without knowing the size of the subsidies or how fast they would grow, it is impossible to assign a dollar value to the cost, as the Obama campaign has tried to do.
- Michael Cooper and Jonathan Weisman 
 9:54 P.M. | Fact Check: What Did the Stimulus Accomplish? 
Mr. Ryan issued a broadside against Mr. Obama's stimulus plan, noting that it did not keep unemployment below 8 percent, as Mr. Obama's economic advisers projected it would before he took office. Mr. Biden defended the bill, saying it helped the economy recover. Who is right?
Before Mr. Obama took office, his economic team issued a paper calling for the passage of a large economic stimulus plan, and printed a chart that they later came to regret, which projected that the unemployment rate would remain below 8 percent with a stimulus plan and hit 9 percent without one. (A footnoted warned: "Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action.")
In fact, the unemployment rate had already hit 8.3 percent in February 2009, Mr. Obama's first full month in office and the month he signed the stimulus into law. It peaked at 10 percent that October and remained at 8.1 percent this August.
The 18-month recession officially ended in June 2009, five months into Mr. Obama's term, as measured by the National Bureau of Economic Research. There is plenty of debate over how effective Mr. Obama's economic policies have been, especially given the painfully slow recovery. But even critics who believe that the president's stimulus law was a missed opportunity - from liberals who say it was too small to conservatives who say it was wasteful and poorly targeted - tend to acknowledge what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has found: that it did save or create jobs, lower the unemployment rate and help the economy grow in the short term.
The budget office used ranges to estimate the impact of stimulus. At its peak in the third quarter of 2010, the budget office found, the stimulus saved or created the equivalent of between one million and 5.1 million full-time jobs, lowered the unemployment rate by between 0.4 and two percentage points, and increased the real gross domestic product by between 0.7 percent and 4.1 percent.
Roughly a third of the stimulus came in the form of tax cuts. It also contained aid to state and local governments, infrastructure spending, and aid for people affected by the downturn.
- Michael Cooper 
 9:51 P.M. | Fact Check: Medicare's $716 Billion Cut? 
 Mr. Ryan made a claim that journalists and independent fact-checkers have repeatedly debunked: that President Obama and Congressional Democrats raided Medicare benefits of $716 billion. But for Mr. Ryan, the claim has drawn countercharges of hypocrisy on his part.
 It was notable enough when Mr. Romney last summer started attacking Mr. Obama for "raiding" Medicare of $716 billion over 10 years to help pay for "Obamacare," and then picked as his running mate Mr. Ryan. As the House Budget Committee chairman, Mr. Ryan had included the same Medicare reductions in the Republican budgets he had passed in the House for two years in a row.
 What was even more remarkable was that Mr. Ryan began echoing the charge against Democrats within days of joining the Romney ticket. By contrast, two years ago Mr. Ryan mostly was silent on this line of attack when Republicans took it up in the 2010 midterm elections. (Back then they spoke of $500 billion in Medicare cuts; the higher figure now reflects a 10-year period through 2022 instead of 2020; savings grow over time.) Though the attack helped Republicans capture control of the House in 2010, the next spring Mr. Ryan, now elevated to Budget Committee chairman, incorporated the Democrats' Medicare savings into his own 10-year budget. He did so again earlier this year.
 Now, as in 2010, the Republican charge has several problems.
 The $716 billion in reductions over a decade would come not from Medicare benefits, but from lower reimbursements to health-care providers, drug-makers and insurers selling so-called Medicare Advantage policies. However, economists argue that cuts to providers often result in reduced services, and some doctors do refuse to accept Medicare.
 The Democrats' reductions did help offset the cost of Mr. Obama's 2010 health-care law. But rather than reduce Medicare benefits, that law also provided Medicare recipients with more generous coverage of prescription drugs and new benefits like free mammograms and other preventive-care treatments.
Also, the Obama reductions added eight years to the life of Medicare's financially troubled trust fund, to 2024, according to Medicare trustees. If the cuts were restored, the insolvency date could revert to 2016.

 9:46 P.M. | A Different Story From the Split Screen 
If the split screen during last week's presidential debate betrayed a slow and unresponsive president, it is revealing something else tonight.
Mr. Biden has been an explosion of reactions all night: laughing, rolling his eyes, grimacing, sighing, furrowing his brow and practically bursting out of his skin to jump at every answer.
The question is: How will it play?
Among hard-core supporters, it will probably be a good thing, giving them the sense that the vice president is aggressively challenging the Republican ticket.
But to others - maybe independents - it may just look as if the vice president had way too many cups of coffee, or maybe Red Bulls.

 9:41 P.M. | Biden Dings Ryan on Stimulus Request 
There was a memorable exchange between Mr. Biden and Mr. Ryan about the much-maligned stimulus program.
Just as Mr. Ryan started to attack the program by pointing to $90 billion in stimulus funds for green energy projects, Mr. Biden laughed and interrupted.
"Go on our Web site. He sent me two letters saying by the way, 'Can you send me stimulus money?' " Mr. Biden said. " 'It will create growth and jobs.' Those are his words. And now, he's sitting here looking at me?"
Mr. Ryan acknowledged saying he had requested stimulus money on behalf of constituents, saying that "that's what we do."
Before moving on to another subject, Mr. Biden quipped, "By the way, any letter you send me, I'll entertain it."
"I appreciate that, Joe," Mr. Ryan said.
- Michael D. Shear 
 9:41 P.M. | Fact Check: Budget Cuts and Embassy Security 
Mr. Biden made the charged assertion that Mr. Ryan has proposed budget cuts that would affect spending for embassy security. 
Mr. Ryan has not made any such specific proposal. But his broader budget proposal would squeeze the nondefense discretionary budget. Presuming that those budget cuts were applied evenly across federal programs, it would result in a $300 million cut for securing and maintaining embassies, the Obama campaign has argued.
"The president certainly doesn¹t need lectures on securing our facilities overseas from Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, who¹ve proposed slashing funding for our diplomatic and embassy security by $298 million dollars" in 2014, an Obama campaign official told The Hill.
Democrats have repeatedly extrapolated how Mr. Ryan's broader budget proposal might squeeze individual programs over the course of the campaign.
- Annie Lowrey 
 9:39 P.M. | Fact Check: Was Obama Silent During Iranian Uprising? 
Mr. Ryan argued that the President was not vocal enough when Iranians took to the streets to protest how the vote was held that re-elected Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
It is true that Mr. Obama waited for days to say anything, and then was lukewarm in his public support of the protesters. It looked and sounded bad, his aides acknowledged, but they say he feared that any public expression of support would enable the mullahs to claim that the uprising was the work of the C.I.A. and crush it. There is a lot of history there: Back in the 1950s the C.I.A. did help stage a coup in Iran, bringing the shah to power.
In the end, it may not have made a difference: the 2009 protests were crushed, quite brutally.
Publicly, the White House insists it got it right. Privately many of the president's aides have their doubts. And when the next protests came, in Egypt in 2011, Mr. Obama quickly sided with the protesters, after younger members of his staff said he had to get "on the right side of history."
- David E. Sanger 
 9:36 P.M. | Fact Check: Blocking New Sanctions on Iran? 
Paul Ryan argued that "the administration was blocking us every step of the way'' on new sanctions on Iran. While the administration did object to some sanctions Congress was considering, Mr. Biden was closer to right when he argued that "the Ayatollah sees his economy being crippled'' by sanctions imposed over the past few years and that Iran's oil sales have plummeted.
Until Mr. Obama came to office, the United Nations sanctions on Iran were pretty ineffective - travel bans on scientists, some banks on sales of certain kinds of equipment. But they didn't go after the heart of the Iranian economy, oil sales. Mr. Obama did exactly that, step by step, making it hard for Iran to get access to dollars, to get international loans, and even to deliver oil. Even today, scores of loaded Iranian oil tankers are bobbing off the country's coast, with nowhere to go.
The result is that the sanctions in place today are far greater than they were under President Bush. But could they be tighter still, even "crippling'' to use the phrase Mr. Romney likes? (He borrowed it from Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.) Certainly they could - but only if other countries agree. Because the U.S. has not had diplomatic relations or any significant trade with Iran for more than three decades, this is all a matter of persuading allies and other countries, and giving them an alternative to Iranian oil. Mr. Romney has not said how he would do that.
What Mr. Obama can't say is that while he ratcheted up the sanctions, he also expanded the covert program to sabotage Iran's nuclear centrifuges - a highly classified program called "Olympic Games.'' It introduced cyber weapons - a computer worm - to destabilize the machinery, buying a bit more time for sanctions to work - but not much.

 9:34 P.M. | Vice-Presidential Debate a Contrast With Presidential 
It's probably too easy to judge the initial moments of this debate against the debate between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney last week.
So of course we will.
First off, Mr. Biden from the opening moment has been doing what Mr. Obama was scored by Democrats for not doing. He brought the attack to Mr. Romney with the very first question, pivoting from a tough question on Libya to offer a strong contrast between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney on Iraq and the killing of Osama bin Laden. Within 25 minutes, Mr. Biden invoked Mr. Romney's 47 percent comment, which never came up at the presidential debate.
If Mr. Obama ceded the stage to Mr. Romney, Mr. Biden - who is anything but retiring by nature - is not.
And it's not only Mr. Biden who is offering a contrast to last week. Martha Raddatz, the moderator, is offering a powerful contrast to the low-key (and much criticized) performance of Jim Lehrer last week. She has been pushing both candidates with tough and challenging questions, and follow-up.
- Adam Nagourney 
 9:31 P.M. | Fact Check: Where Is the Red Line? 
Paul Ryan and Vice President Biden debated what the so-called red line is on moving to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons capability.

Sometimes, there has been a clear difference in where President Obama and Mitt Romney would draw a red line beyond which they would not let Iran go toward a nuclear weapon. But more often than not, it has been more like a red smudge, giving both candidates maximum flexibility, while each tries to sound more determined to stop the Iranian program.
Mr. Obama's position has been the most consistent. He has said consistently that Iran would not be permitted to get a nuclear weapon. But when pressed about Iran's achieving a weapons "capability'' - that is, to obtain the fuel and technology that would put it just short of having a weapon - he said, "I'm not going to parse that.'' And he hasn't.
Mr. Romney, in contrast, has parsed it - but inconsistently. He usually says he would not allow Iran to have the capability to make a bomb - to be just a few screwdriver turns away, as his aides put it. But in an interview last month with George Stephanopoulos of ABC, Mr. Romney forgot his own position, and made it sound as if he and Mr. Obama were on the same page. A few days later he went back to his old formulation.
It sounds like a small difference, but it is a huge one - technologically and politically. Many experts believe Iran only intends to approach the line of having a weapon, stopping a step or two short. That would enable it to stay inside the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, of which it is a signatory. And it would make it harder for Israel, or the United States, to mount an attack that gained global support. Moreover, a "capability'' may be all Iran needs, in a world where a virtual bomb brings with it almost as much symbolic power as a real one.
But Mr. Obama is being vague for a reason. "He doesn't want to agree to a certain amount of uranium, or a certain deadline, that triggers a war," one of his aides said last month. "He needs room to resolve this peacefully."

The sanctions in place today are far greater than they were under President Bush. But they could be tighter still, even "crippling'' to use the phrase Mr. Romney likes.
On the question of Iran sanctions, Mr. Obama has got a lot of history on his side.

 9:19 P.M. | Fact Check: Do Marines Guard Embassies? 
Mr. Ryan was correct to say that Marine embassy guards serve at both embassies and consulates. But he was incorrect when he said that Marines were bodyguards for the ambassador in Paris or anywhere else. Marines guard the embassy, but do not usually provide full-time bodyguard protection for ambassadors. Their mission is to protect United States personnel, property and classified material.
 An earlier version of this post, in assessing the accuracy of Mr. Ryan's opening statement, incorrectly said where Marine guards can serve. They serve at both United States embassies and consulates, as Mr. Ryan said, not only at embassies.

 9:16 P.M. | Biden Comes Out Firing 
Is Mr. Biden planning on being aggressive?
The vice president came out firing against Mr. Ryan, saying within moments that his rival's answer was "malarkey."
The subject - Libya and foreign policy - prompted Mr. Ryan to accuse the Obama administration of troubling failures regarding the attacks on the consulate and of broader failures in foreign affairs across the region.
Perhaps aware of the desire among Democrats for Mr. Biden to be aggressive, the statements prompted a quick reply.
"With all due respect, that's a bunch of malarkey," Mr. Biden said, "because not a single thing he said was accurate."
The vice president retorted that criticism about embassy security from Mr. Ryan didn't ring true.
"The congressman here cut embassy security $300 million below what we asked for," he said. And he quickly charged that Mr. Romney had politicized the attacks early on.
"Governor Romney, before we even knew that our ambassador was killed," made a statement, Mr. Biden said.

In an e-mail to supporters of President Obama's campaign that was sent out moments before the debate began, Mr. Biden lays out what he plans to do in his face-off with Mr. Ryan.
"I told Barack I have one mission tonight: tell the truth and stand up for what we believe in," Mr. Biden says. "Our side is always going to win when we do that."
That will come as a relief to Democrats, many of whom were frustrated - and even angry - at Mr. Obama for not standing up for his beliefs during the debate with Mitt Romney last week.
Now, the question is whether Mr. Biden will follow through with his promise and be aggressive in the debate. Part of that will depend on how Mr. Ryan handles the debate, and what he says.
In the e-mail, Mr. Biden says he's ready for anything.
"I can't predict if Paul Ryan will follow Mitt Romney's lead tonight, hiding and flat-out denying their unpopular ideas, or if he'll come prepared to have a real debate about where this country should go," Mr. Biden says. "Trust me, I'm ready for anything."
If that sounds good to Democrats receiving the e-mail, the campaign will be happy. Because the message ends with a familiar refrain:
"Please donate $5 or more today," it says.

 8:38 P.M. | Biden and Ryan, Alike in Many Ways 
The debate Thursday night will be a study in contrasts. A 69-year-old silver-haired politician versus an opponent 27 years his junior.
But hold on. Beyond their ages, the differences may not be that stark. Consider:
* Both men are creatures of Congress, having arrived in the nation's capital as very young men. Mr. Biden started as a senator in 1973, when he was 31. Mr. Ryan was 28 when he took office.
* Both men are Roman Catholic, though neither wears his religion on his sleeve.
* Both are from small-town America. Mr. Ryan frequently talks about his Norman Rockwell-like upbringing in Janesville, Wis. Mr. Biden, originally from Scranton, Pa., frequently takes Amtrak back to his Wilmington, Del., home.
* Both stress their working-class roots. Mr. Biden is a roll-up-your-sleeves populist who is at his best in front of blue-collar workers in the industrial Midwest. Mr. Ryan, while monkish, has working-class roots, having had his father die when he was young.
* Both men are policy wonks. Mr. Ryan has spent a career delving into the national budget. Mr. Biden was known as a foreign policy guru during his career in the Senate, and he has been the "sheriff" of the stimulus program, steeped in facts and figures.

 8:26 P.M. | Nationals' Win an Omen? 
The Washington Nationals kept their first-in-almost-a-century playoff hopes alive on Thursday, winning Game 4 just before the beginning of the vice-presidential debate.
So it must be an omen for one of the vice-presidential candidates, right?
The question is: which one?
Neither Mr. Biden nor Mr. Ryan chose to leave the campaign trail to take in one of the historic games in Washington. Fair weather fans, both.
So who gets the edge from the Washington win?
Maybe Mr. Biden. After all, as vice president he has already gotten to throw out the first pitch at a Baltimore Orioles game in 2009. (President Obama was out of the country on his first foreign trip.)
Or, maybe it's Mr. Ryan, who just Thursday was shown wearing a backward red baseball cap in a photo spread taken last year by Time Magazine. (He was posing for the Man of the Year feature. He was a runner-up.)
Either way, bet on both men agreeing on one thing: if Washington wins, they will both root for the team.
- Michael D. Shear 
 8:21 P.M. | Romney Calls to Wish Ryan Good Luck 
Mitt Romney won't be there in person to root on his running mate. But at least he called.
Campaigning in North Carolina on Thursday, Mr. Romney placed a good-luck phone call to Mr. Ryan ahead of the congressman's first appearance on a national debate stage.
The call lasted just five minutes and included some good wishes from a few friends who happened to be with Mr. Romney in North Carolina.
"Speaker Boehner, Senator Portman and Governor Huckabee were present," according to a spokesman for the campaign. "Governor Romney handed the phone around so they could say hello and pass along their best wishes."

 6:30 P.M. | For Biden and Ryan, Substance and Style Hurdles 
The debate on Thursday night between Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Representative Paul D. Ryan will be split into nine 10-minute segments, with Martha Raddatz, the moderator, choosing the topics for each.
Ms. Raddatz, the senior foreign affairs correspondent for ABC News, has said she plans to alternate between domestic and foreign policy during the 90-minute debate. Her success at keeping to that schedule may depend on how feisty the two candidates are.
But if she sticks to her plan, the debate could become a rare, broad-ranging discussion that offers voters a good opportunity to judge the two men and their capabilities.
While it is hard to know exactly what topics might come up, here is a look at some of the possible lines of questioning and the challenges they could pose for the candidates, on both substance and style. Read more ...

 6:28 P.M. | Six Things to Watch For in Biden-Ryan Debate 
Over three days last week, Representative Paul D. Ryan reserved an indoor tennis court at a Virginia resort - not to practice his backhand, but to hold mock debates. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been at his own debate camp in Delaware this week, overseen by President Obama's top political strategist, David Axelrod.
After Mitt Romney's momentum-shifting performance in the first presidential debate, the stakes were raised for the matchup between their chief surrogates.
The vice-presidential candidates have spent weeks going over their own and their opponent's talking points for Thursday night's debate in Danville, Ky. Here are six things to watch: Read more ...

HEADLINE: What the Presidential Candidates Say About Tech

BYLINE: SOMINI SENGUPTA


HIGHLIGHT: New York Tech MeetUp, a nonprofit group that represents computer coders and other technology industry people in New York, asked the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates to explain how their policies "would benefit the growth of New York start-up community and other start-up entrepreneurs." 

 BODY:
New York Tech MeetUp, a nonprofit group that represents computer coders and other technology industry people in New York, asked the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates to pitch how their policies "would benefit the growth of New York start-up community and other start-up entrepreneurs."
Each campaign.
Mitt Romney promised, among other things, to raise visa caps for "highly skilled foreign workers," lower the corporate tax rate to 25 percent and weaken the power of regulatory agencies. He offered a vague paean to technology entrepreneurs, too, some of whom have generously donated to his campaign. "As president, I will emphasize policies that once again make America the best place in the world to make a discovery, start a business, hire a worker or find a job," he wrote. 
Barack Obama, once crowned "the tech president," sought to cast himself as the candidate who understands "innovation" and praised technology professionals. "And the reason I've never been more optimistic about the future is because of all of you," he wrote. "You'll be the next entrepreneur to turn a big idea into something - a new invention or an entire new
industry."
He told the group that he had invested in broadband connectivity, signed a law making it easier for start-ups to go public, established a "start-up visa program" to allow foreigners to set up businesses in this country and created a new White House job -- chief technology officer.

HEADLINE: Janeane From Des Moines

BYLINE: By DANIEL M. GOLD

 BODY:
In the months leading up to this year's Iowa caucuses, Janeane Wilson, a 47-year-old home-health-care aide struggling to make ends meet, made the Republican rounds. She attended rallies for every presidential candidate and spoke with most, even sat down with Michele Bachmann; she was interviewed by reporters and briefly featured on ABC News. 
Almost predictably, it turns out Janeane was a fictional character, movingly played by the actress Jane Edith Wilson, left, in ''Janeane From Des Moines,'' Grace Lee's mockumentary about the intersection of politics and embattled lives in recessionary times. Janeane, staunchly conservative and deeply religious, initially just seeks a candidate to support. But the crippled economy profoundly shakes her world. When her husband loses his job, everything begins to go: their health insurance, their marriage, their home.
The film doesn't really mock anyone, not even the candidates who, when confronted with a person in need looking for solutions, can offer only vague policy statements and anti-Obama rhetoric. With Ms. Wilson's rare talent for staying in character as the media circus swirls around her, ''Janeane From Des Moines'' is actually a commentary on the immense gap between a desperate citizen and the politics she had hoped might help her.
Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Directed by Grace Lee 1 hour 18 minutes; not rated

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths COLWELL, PHOEBE ANN TALBOT PETERSON

 BODY:
COLWELL--Phoebe Ann Talbot Peterson, 79, departed this world October 2, 2012 in Boise, ID, with family at her side. She died peacefully and with dignity, after enduring a long struggle with Alzheimer's. Her journey begins anew, a daisy blooming in the fresh morning light. Phoebe was born on April 4, 1933 in Berlin, Germany to American banker Arthur T. Peterson and his wife, Phoebe. 
Her early childhood was spent primarily in Europe, relocating from Germany to London, and then to the US during World War II. She returned to Europe after the war ended, attended high school in Switzerland, and returned to the US as a young adult. She spent time in California before marrying and settling in Grand View-on-Hudson, New York, where she raised a family, obtained undergraduate and graduate degrees, and managed a long and productive professional career. She devoted many years of service to Nyack Hospital and the Nyack Hospital Foundation. She was very active in her community, and touched and influenced many people. Phoebe lived her final years in the presence of loving and compassionate care provided by the Staff and Volunteers at Willow Park Assisted Living Center/Kingswood Manor in Boise, ID. Phoebe lived a full life. She was funny, spontaneous, creative, witty, tenacious, at times feisty, and fiercely independent. She was a woman of many diverse roles: mother, homemaker, writer, traveler, photographer, master cook, home economist, fund-raiser, and much more. Phoebe was an avid gardener, always rescuing the least-worthy plant, and nurturing it back to life. She also loved her animals. Having grown up in many differing geographies, she valued roots, family and community. It was in Grand View where her roots were firmly planted, surrounded by her magnificent gardens, which survive today. Phoebe lives on in our hearts, minds, souls, and in the gardens of friends and family, where her plants remind us all of her. She is survived by her brother, Sterrett C. Peterson of Glenside, Pennsylvania, daughter Megan G. Colwell (Bonnie Stewart) of Oakland, California, sons Douglas T. Colwell (Carol) of Boise, Idaho, Lincoln Colwell of Sparkill, New York, Joshua Colwell (Kai) of King George, Virginia, and daughter Honor Colwell (Ken Hazucha) of Binghamton, New York. She is survived by six grandchildren, Mario and Douglas Bruzzone of California, Drew and Claire Colwell of Boise, Idaho, and Max and Heidi Colwell of King George, Virginia. A memorial service will be held at Grace Episcopal Church in Nyack, New York at 2pm on Saturday, November 3, 2012. Thoughts, testimonials, and words of sympathy can be emailed to phoebememories@gmail.com Donations in her memory can be made to The Alzheimer's Association of America or your local regional office www.alz.org

HEADLINE: You Want Haunted? We've Got Jeffrey Dahmer in the House

BYLINE: By JASON ZINOMAN

 BODY:
The haunted house is theater's answer to the video game: interactive, addictive and often underestimated as an art form. Audience members move room to room, with surprises around every corner. While the experience is highly structured, there are enough choices for viewers to make that no two visits are exactly alike. 
The central difference, of course, is that no matter how enveloping a video-game world may be, it can't simulate the reality of being chased by a man with a power drill. ''Killers: A Nightmare Haunted House,'' at Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, the latest theatrical scare show by Timothy Haskell, exploits this advantage splendidly. Instead of startling audiences with ghosts or vampires or movie villains, the production is peopled with real-life serial killers like Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy.
You enter the dark, smoky house in groups of six and over the course of 40 minutes, you get a view of the dining room of Ed Gein, the graveyard-robbing lunatic who inspired the makers of ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' and ''The Silence of the Lambs,'' and the streets where Jack the Ripper prowled. These celebrity killers appear in economically plotted, vividly designed vignettes that end with a strategically timed shock. It may be the sudden sound of a chain saw or something slithering around your feet. And what's that smell?
Mr. Haskell stages these mini-dramas and sleights of hand with the panache of a seasoned magician. His production includes limited dialogue, sticking primarily to an evocative and detailed visual vocabulary, steering clear of indulgent theatrical flourishes and thematic self-importance. Paul Smithyman's production design is, like so many of the greatest horror movies rooted, in a grim realism. The sets are full of empty spaces interrupted by chaotic messes; the lighting is stark and the sound cacophonous. This is a no-nonsense haunted house, a taut, assured production that knows exactly what it wants to do (scare the hell out of you) and performs its task with ruthless, coldblooded precision.
''Killers: A Nightmare Haunted House'' continues through Nov. 3 at Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side; hauntedhousenyc.com.

HEADLINE: A Veteran Returns to the Mound: The Bullpen Car

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
BULLPEN cars last roamed ballparks nearly 20 years ago, whisking relief pitchers to the mound during games. Christopher Hill never forgot them.
As vice president for business development of the Sugar Land Skeeters outside Houston, Mr. Hill works for a team keenly interested in putting fans in the seats; it just finished first in average attendance in its first season in the eight-team Atlantic League.
The Skeeters lured Roger Clemens, 50, the seven-time Cy Young Award winner, out of retirement to pitch twice for the team. To entertain the home crowds, Mr. Hill came up with not one but two furry mosquito mascots: Swatson and Moe. Then he went to work on finding a bullpen car. 
''We had to design it,'' he said. ''There is no product line for these, and it had been a long time since someone had done one.''
According to a 2007 article for ESPN.com by Paul Lukas, the first bullpen car was believed to be a "little red auto" that the Cleveland Indians used in 1950 to transport relievers to the mound, saving time at their cavernous ballpark. The last bullpen car in the big leagues was actually a Harley-Davidson motorcycle with a sidecar that the Milwaukee Brewers used in 1995, the article said.
But once nearly every big league team had a bullpen car; it was typically a tricked-out golf cart with a gigantic replica of the host team's cap as the roof. The Yankees used a pinstriped Datsun in the 1970s before rats chewed the engine cables. (The Baltimore Orioles pitcher Mike Flanagan once said: ''I could never play in New York. The first time I ever came into a game there, I got in the bullpen car and they told me to lock the doors.'')
Looking for someone who could build a bullpen car with all the bells and whistles, Mr. Hill called Alex Restrepo, whose business in southeast Houston focuses on custom audio units for cars, boats and motorcycles.
Mr. Hill knew enough to suggest that Mr. Restrepo start with the chassis of a golf cart. Mr. Restrepo was up for the challenge -- ''It's a tough economy, and you've got to be imaginative,'' he said. But he was just a boy when bullpen cars were popular. ''So I went to Google, like everybody else,'' Mr. Restrepo said.
He found photos of old bullpen cars and photos of die-cast toy bullpen cars that were being sold on eBay. Mr. Restrepo, in his late 20s, said, ''So I start looking at the years, and I'm saying to myself, 'Man, some of these things are 30 years old!' ''
Mr. Restrepo said the project took four or five months, and he often had his employees pitching in when they were not busy with other jobs. Finally, he pieced it all together: a battery-run golf cart with a baseball-shaped body, made from fiberglass and wood, with a replica of a Skeeters cap on top held up by two bats. Mr. Restrepo did not forget bells and whistles like leather seats, neon blue lights, a sound system, a backup camera -- and a bubble machine.
Mr. Hill found a corporate sponsor for the car: Texas Direct Auto, an online automobile dealership with a showroom in nearby Stafford. The company happily paid the Skeeters to slap its logo on the front.
The car was a bigger hit than Mr. Hill imagined. Fans actually applauded when it took pitchers into the game the first weekend it was used, he said. The Skeeters have tried to use the car as much as possible in the community, for things like store openings.
Mr. Hill said ''five or six'' ball clubs, both major league and minor league teams, called to find out more.
Another who called was Mark Sofia, 46, of Tampa, Fla., a retired police sergeant from Rochester who for a time ran youth hockey programs for the Tampa Bay Lightning, a National Hockey League team.
A fan of the minor league Rochester Red Wings as a youngster, Mr. Sofia said he grew up with the Red Wings' gimmicks for wooing fans -- like women in hot pants and go-go boots who swept the bases to the ''William Tell'' Overture. When he stopped working for the Lightning, Mr. Sofia picked up the idea of making bullpen cars as a marketing tool for baseball teams.
He flew to Houston to see the Skeeters' car. He found a golf-cart fabricator near his home in Florida that could make bullpen cars.
He floated his idea past Dan Mason, the longtime general manager of the Red Wings, who agreed that bullpen cars would be a way to market any team. ''Many of your partners are looking for ways to get their messages out,'' Mr. Mason said.
Texas Direct Auto plans, for example, to park the Skeeters' bullpen car in its showroom during the off-season. Mr. Mason said the car could be driven up and down the street on the day of a game to help sell tickets.
Pitchers have never seemed to enjoy being driven into a game in a bullpen car, but Mr. Mason said that was practically beside the point. ''There are plenty of other uses for a bullpen car if the pitchers themselves decide they'd rather run or jog in,'' he said.
Mr. Sofia, who has a Web site, www.sportskartz.com, is optimistic that he will have a model to take in December to the Baseball Trade Show in Nashville, also the site of this year's winter meetings. He would not disclose his planned sticker price. (A new golf cart can be bought for around $7,000, so a customized bullpen car would most likely go for about twice that amount.) But teams, he said, should be able to afford one, especially if they can find a sponsor as the Skeeters did.
Jessica DeMarr, director of business development at Texas Direct Auto, said: ''It's a real easy way to market, but it's not like, 'Hey, we're marketing this to you.' This was a real fun way to reach out to kids. They'll want to take pictures with the car.''
Like the bobblehead doll, the bullpen car might make a comeback, becoming part of future baseball lore. When the Mets clinched the National League East division title in September 1986, a fan took over the bullpen car and drove around the outfield -- before it conked out. Mr. Sofia is hoping for a much longer and prosperous run.

HEADLINE: When a Crisis Comes With a Reset Button

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
ONCE again, the global auto industry is discovering that America is still the best place in the world to make money selling cars.
After dropping precipitously just three years ago, the United States market is growing fast and furiously, up 14 percent this year and headed above 14 million in annual sales for the first time since 2007.
It has been a sudden, stunning turnaround, particularly when compared with the deepening gloom in the European market, the volatility in South America and an unexpected slowdown in China.
The economic environment in the United States has hardly been ideal for a comeback in the car market. Unemployment remains stubbornly high. Housing starts are flat. Consumer confidence is shaky at best. Yet people who put off buying a new car during the recession have come back in droves. And after crashing to its lowest sales level in 25 years in 2009, the United States market has regained its status as a safe haven for the world's automakers and their most reliable source of profits. 
''The industry was able to heal itself with natural remedies: new products, improved gas mileage, better technology and providing good value to people who need to replace older models,'' said Jesse Toprak, chief market analyst for the auto research site TrueCar.com.
Meanwhile, the European market has crumbled under a debt crisis and recession that could depress sales for several more years. China's sensational growth rate has tapered off as well, even as manufacturers keep building factories.
The wild fluctuations have forced car companies to react more rapidly by taking advantage of strong demand in some markets while steeling themselves for lengthier recoveries in others.
''As you move from place to place you actually have to change your spots,'' said Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of Chrysler and its parent company, the Italian carmaker Fiat. ''I mean, it's like you go through reincarnations every time you travel into different jurisdictions.''
Mr. Marchionne's challenge is a snapshot of the difficulties facing most global competitors. In the United States, Chrysler has rebounded from bankruptcy and a government bailout to become the hottest American car company, posting double-digit growth with a revamped lineup of passenger cars and S.U.V.'s.
But in Europe, Fiat is struggling to keep its plants running at even half-speed.
All over the Continent, automakers are slowing production to match steadily shrinking demand. Once a pillar of stable, predictable demand, Europe now faces the same overcapacity issues that plagued the American market a few years ago.
Mr. Marchionne has become a lightning rod for criticism in Europe and in Fiat's home market in Italy for advocating a regionwide restructuring to reduce production.
Other automakers have been less vocal, but share his concerns that too many plants are making too many vehicles for too few buyers.
''This is not a cyclical issue, it's a structural one,'' said Robert Shanks, the chief financial officer of the Ford Motor Company, which expects to lose more than $1 billion in Europe this year.
The crisis in Europe underscores how even the most mature automotive markets can lose their equilibrium when larger economic forces depress demand. Riding out the downturn is not an option, not when inventories and losses are piling up month after month.
''If I told you that the set of tasks we are facing are easy, I'd be lying,'' Mr. Marchionne said. ''They require every ounce of skill that you have.''
The American market, however, looked just as dismal three years ago. For too long automakers kept overproducing, then greasing the market with cheap loans and big discounts to move unsold inventories. Consumers waited for the next sales promotion, confident that carmakers would undercut one another on price to generate demand.
Like the European car companies, Detroit's three automakers were locked into union contracts that made closing factories and cutting jobs difficult and expensive. Buying out workers cost billions of dollars and cut into capital budgets needed to make better, more competitive cars.
The reckoning came when fuel prices shot up in the spring of 2008 and the market for large trucks and S.U.V.'s collapsed overnight. Then the economy turned sour, credit dried up and auto sales plunged. General Motors and Chrysler needed a government bailout to survive, while Ford squeaked through only because it had been prescient enough in 2006 to mortgage its assets and borrow $23 billion.
Yet the crisis was exactly what the American industry needed to reform and set the stage for its remarkable recovery.
Bankruptcy forced G.M. to drastically scale back production and eliminate entire divisions like Pontiac and Saturn. Under Mr. Marchionne, Chrysler pulled back on sales incentives and allowed its market share to bottom out. Even Ford, the healthiest of the three, streamlined its product lineup and poured resources into models that could be sold throughout the world.
By getting smaller and more focused, the Detroit companies were poised to benefit when consumer demand picked up. And instead of buyers being lured into showrooms by sales promotions, they returned to the market more to replace older models.
The average age of vehicles on the road had ballooned to 11 years, and many of those older models had woeful fuel economy. The aging of the nation's fleet turned out to be the best stimulus the industry could ask for. And when consumers began shopping, they found the products offered by Detroit and its competitors to be more fuel-efficient than ever and laden with new technology and safety features.
''The key was that the industry could now sell new cars without resorting to huge incentives that destroyed profits,'' said Mr. Toprak, the analyst. ''Then they could spend more on improving their products.''
Now the three Detroit companies are creating jobs rather than cutting them and adding shifts at plants rather than shutting them down. It's not just the domestic automakers capitalizing, either. The German automaker Volkswagen, for example, is already expanding its new plant in Tennessee to meet the growing demand. And Japanese automakers are trying to shift as much production as possible to North America to take advantage of the revitalized market.
Predictions that the United States auto market had lost its vitality seem hollow now. Sales are on track for a third consecutive year of double-digit percentage growth. By next year, analysts expect industry sales to top 15 million vehicles.
The resurgence offers lessons for other markets, especially Europe. The crisis in the American industry was a shock to the system, forcing management and labor alike to confront the problem of spiraling costs and overproduction.
''We need to address our issues in Europe the same way we did in the U.S.,'' said Stephen J. Girsky, G.M.'s vice chairman and interim head of its troubled Opel division in Europe. ''We cannot be satisfied to keep losing money.''
European sales have fallen 7 percent so far this year, and some countries like Italy are doing even worse. Yet it's rare that even a single factory closes on the Continent, because of the opposition of unions as well as governments. Calls for restructuring are met with protests, even as plants operate far below capacity and dealerships are clogged with a backlog of inventory.
''Europe is in a lot of ways almost like a hopeless romantic,'' Mr. Marchionne said. ''I mean it's sitting over there wishing that things were different than they are.''
The resistance to painful restructuring is reminiscent of how the United Automobile Workers union fought cutbacks by the Detroit companies for years. Contracts and past promises were considered sacrosanct -- even the much-criticized ''jobs bank'' in which idled employees were paid not to work.
But the financial crisis changed all that. The corporations and their work forces were forced to make hard choices to regain their competitiveness, including the introduction of a two-tier wage system in unionized plants.
It appears to be only a matter of time before the European industry confronts the same tough issues and sharply reduces the cost of producing cars. And the slowdown in sales now will have a benefit down the road, when consumers need to replace outdated clunkers with new products.
The situation in China also recalls a simpler era in the American industry. In the boom decades of the 1950s and '60s, carmakers indiscriminately built new factories to keep up with rising demand. As the country grew wealthier, the odds were that consumers would continue to splurge on new, fancier cars.
But even the fastest-growing economies have to catch their breath, and China is proving no exception. Overproduction there will eventually force automakers to offer discounts, which in turn will reduce the amount they spend on new models. No market, not even China, can avoid the pitfalls of overexpansion, Mr. Marchionne said.
''Whenever you go through excesses, the steady hand says that you need to retrench,'' he said. ''If you believe in the bubble, you're going to end up with a lot of soap on your face when it bursts.''
It took a hard fall for the American industry to learn that lesson. In the absence of its tremendous cash squeeze in late 2008, G.M. might have continued muddling along, losing money while producing far more vehicles than it could sell. It took billions in losses before Ford was willing to part with unprofitable brands like Jaguar. And Chrysler might never have broadened its truck-heavy lineup to include smaller, more fuel-efficient cars if its very existence were not threatened.
The newfound discipline by the American companies is producing better cars for consumers, which is crucial to maintaining a steady, sustainable level of demand. No longer does Detroit rely on cut-rate leases to entice buyers into its latest models. Now shoppers are more willing to choose their next car based on its features and performance instead of discounted prices or monthly payments.
The broader solution to a healthy global industry is spreading the costs of developing a new car by starting with vehicle platforms that can yield several models.
Companies like Toyota, Nissan and Volkswagen produce an average of eight models off a single platform, according to Barclays Capital. G.M., by comparison, gets fewer than three models off a typical platform.
The best carmakers can take the basic platforms and generate different cars for different regions, and tailor their production plans depending on sales. Factories can be more nimble, substituting a hot-selling model for one that is lagging in another market.
Economies of scale and so-called global platforms have long been the goal of many automakers, but few have achieved them. Some companies have failed by refusing to homogenize platforms for fear of diluting their brands. The merger of Daimler and Chrysler fell apart partly because of a reluctance to share platforms between Daimler's Mercedes-Benz luxury cars and Chrysler's mass-market models.
Mr. Marchionne has a unique vantage point on that challenge. He has so far successfully used Fiat-based technology and platforms to improve Chrysler's product lineup. And he readily acknowledges that the turmoil and trouble Chrysler went through prepared the foundation for its marriage to Fiat.
The American auto industry, he said, is better off for having gone though the wringer of bankruptcies, bailouts and horrible sales.
''Surviving these events makes you into a different person because you end up realizing you got really close to losing it all,'' he said. ''You end up appreciating every damn thing that happens to you because you know deep down it could have been otherwise.''
The troubles in Europe should be a constant reminder of what the American industry went through just a few short years ago. ''And if we don't manage it properly,'' Mr. Marchionne said, ''it could happen again.''

HEADLINE: The Bad Boys of the Road Warm Their Engines

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
IN a limping postrecession economy, one can imagine a spouse's response when a car lover pulls a hot new two-seater into the driveway: ''Are you crazy? Take that thing back.''
Sports car sales naturally collapsed with the economy, as shellshocked consumers lost the means, desire or confidence to splurge on a car with no real purpose besides fun.
But with the industry finally gathering momentum, car companies are readying a pretty, powerful wave of luxury sports cars -- and crossing fingers that Americans will start treating themselves to grown-up toys.
For 2011, such familiar models as the Mercedes SL, Jaguar XK, Nissan GT-R and Porsche Boxster and Cayman all had something in common: Not one found even 2,000 buyers in America. By last year, sales of all premium sporty cars combined had tumbled to half their prerecession levels of 2007, according to the industry analyst LMC Automotive. Medium sporty cars, a segment dominated by the Corvette, Porsche 911 and Mercedes SL, were especially hammered, falling 62 percent. 
From that 2011 low, LMC Automotive projects that luxury sports car sales will rise 91 percent by 2015 -- still well below the go-go heights of the mid-2000s, but a healthy comeback for this sex-on-wheels brigade.
No model is grabbing more attention than the 2014 Jaguar F-Type convertible. The long-awaited descendant of the classic, cigar-shaped E-Type was introduced in Paris last month, the company's first pure two-seater since the E-Type ceased production in 1974.
For Jaguar, which has struggled to capture American luxury buyers despite a thoroughly revamped lineup, the F-Type allows Jaguar to ''hit the reset button on the brand,'' says David Pryor, Jaguar's brand vice president for North America.
''We've been missing a true sports car for almost 40 years,'' Mr. Pryor said. ''And sports cars are core to our brand, the embodiment of all our DNA.''
The shapely Jag goes on sale early next summer, powered by either a supercharged V-6 or V-8 engine, and priced from $69,875 to $92,875.
''We do see some optimism in the market, and we think we're coming at an ideal time to capture that,'' he said.
For buyers of more means, there's the alluring Ferrari F12 Berlinetta: The fastest road-going Ferrari in history, hauling to 211 m.p.h. with its 730-horsepower V-12, reaches American shores early next year, at a price analysts expect to top $300,000. Also navigating the upper crust, the roughly $280,000 Aston Martin Vanquish arrives in early 2013, with its own V-12 pumping out 565 horsepower.
Yet in the upper reaches, speed is no longer enough to satisfy. Models that scored in performance but were critically shamed for bare-bones interiors are buffing up cabins to justify ever-inflating prices. Those include two muscled-up Yanks: Right around the holidays, Chrysler's macho SRT Viper returns from a two-year hiatus, sporting not just a 640-horsepower V-10, but seats from the same supplier used by Ferrari. And while it hasn't broken cover in public, the eighth generation of the iconic Corvette, arriving next year as a 2014 model, will look to change the Vette's reputation for plasticky, indifferent cabins.
Even the redesigned 2013 Porsche Boxster convertible, Porsche's ''budget'' sports car at $50,450 to start, offers a leather-swaddled cabin worthy of its more expensive 911 stablemate.
Ralph Gilles, Chrysler's chief designer and chief executive of the high-performance SRT brand, said that the company invested ''probably four times as much'' money in the Viper's cabin as in the previous model. He recalls a recent driving preview of the new Viper that drew 850 fanatical owners. For all the gains in performance and technology, owners couldn't stop talking about the interior.
''They loved the way it feels, loved the way it smells,'' Mr. Gilles said. ''It lets them bring a friend along and revel in the details, and that adds to the Viper's qualifications as a world-class car.''
On the German side, the stalwart 2013 Mercedes SL is the latest iteration of a car that dates to the museum-worthy SL Gullwing of the '50s. BMW's 2013 M6 coupe and convertible, with a fierce 560-horsepower, twin-turbocharged V-8, are the latest luxury weapons from the vaunted high-performance M division.
Upstarts are entering the picture as well. With four doors, the all-electric Tesla Model S (from about $58,570 to $106,570) is officially a sports sedan, though its Jaguaresque curves and racy performance will have many consumers thinking ''sports car.'' Equipped with the strongest of three available battery packs, the longest-range electric car can scoot from zero to 60 m.p.h. in less than five seconds -- and keep going for up to 300 miles on a single charge.
Even for ''full line'' carmakers that offer everything from economy cars to minivans and S.U.V.'s, sports cars hold a special status that goes beyond the bottom line.
As with Jaguar and the F-Type, Mr. Gilles cites the Viper as a true ''halo car'' -- a crowd-pleasing, high-performance model that doesn't sell in droves, but that buffs a brand's image and brings consumers into dealerships for a peek. Even if those dreamers end up buying another family-friendly sedan, the halo car has done its job.
Yet unlike the old days, when those halo cars often received special dispensations -- coddled and nurtured whether they made money or not -- top auto executives typically insist that even their thoroughbreds put money back in company coffers.
''One thing Sergio told me,'' said Mr. Gilles, referring to the Fiat and Chrysler chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, is that ''I love the (Viper), but it has to stand on its own legs.''
The original Viper -- whose radical, All-American design was a public sensation in the early '90s -- was widely credited with helping revive a then-moribund Chrysler, despite selling only about 1,500 units in a typical year. With today's Chrysler emerging from bankruptcy and bailout, the new Viper could have an emotional effect of its own.
''When people drive these cars, they feel like superheroes,'' Mr. Gilles says. ''That's something a business case doesn't measure.''

Museums
Asia Society and Museum: 'Bound Unbound: Lin Tianmiao' (through Jan. 27) Lin Tianmiao is one of a rare kind in China, where she lives: a nationally and internationally renowned female artist. This museumwide show presents installations that have not been widely seen. Influenced by American artists like Kiki Smith, Louise Bourgeois and Ann Hamilton -- who made the female body and traditional women's occupations hot topics during the 1990s when Ms. Lin was living in New York -- these productions are not particularly original. But they are striking for their surrealistic theatricality and labor intensive craft. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Ken Johnson) 
Brooklyn Museum: 'Jean-Michel Othoniel: My Way' (through Dec. 2) Some of the art in this whimsical but cloying midcareer survey can strike you as the sculptural equivalent of haute couture. A bed framed by Murano glass beads is accompanied by veils of tulle, each one hand embroidered with gold thread in a workshop established by Louis XIV. Elsewhere, 4,200 yellow blown-glass bricks, shaped by artisans from Firozabad, India, form a shimmering rectangular solid. Early works in wax, sulfur and obsidian are more personal and provocative, showing the influence of mentors and peers like Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Robert Gober, Sophie Calle and Annette Messager. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Mickalene Thomas: Origin of the Universe' (through Jan. 20) This invigorating exhibition is dominated by big, brash collagelike paintings, thick with color and studded with rhinestones that depict cacophonous landscapes, spatially skewed interiors and, best of all, images of imperious black women among swaths of brightly patterned fabrics. Building on Conceptual identity art, borrowing from art history and 1970s blaxploitation extravagance, they subvert prevailing notions of beauty and taste and subvert the male gaze while offering resounding proof that the political, not only the personal, can also be stunningly pictorial. Bravo. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Picasso Black and White' (through Jan. 23) Billed as the first monochromatic look at Picasso's whole career, this exhibition is as eye-opening as it is elegant. That's especially true among the later works on the upper ramps, which push well past the obligatory Neo-Classicism and Analytic Cubism into bracingly sensual explorations of the figure, strident political cries de coeur à la Guernica, and winking homages to Delacroix and Velázquez. Also notable: Thirty eight of the show's 118 works have never been exhibited in this country, and 5, among them the sharply angular ''Bust of a Woman With a Hat'' (1939), have never been on view publicly. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; International Center of Photography: 'Rise and Fall of Apartheid: Photography and Bureaucracy of Everyday Life' (through Jan. 6) With more than 500 photographs -- supplemented by books, magazines, posters and films -- spread over two floors, this show documenting institutionalized racism in South Africa from 1948 to the election of Nelson Mandela in 1994 can't help but be overwhelming. But it's pitched as much to the mind, as to the heart. On the one hand, it's a grand narrative of stirring sights: ardent faces, agitated bodies, camaraderie, clenched fists, funerals. It's also a disquisition on the ordinariness of goodness and evil, on how people in a particular time and place encounter and partake of both, and go on with their lives. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Holland Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Bernini: Sculpting in Clay' (through Jan. 6) Gian Lorenzo Bernini, one of the great marble sculptors of all time, never made an artwork in clay as a finished piece. He did, however, use clay to work out his ideas, and he probably produced thousands of studies in that generously plastic material. But today only 52 pieces in clay are known to have been made by him, and this revealing exhibition presents 39 of them. They range from small, quickly made sketches of angels and other beings that today look surprisingly modern to an amazing, half-size lion pausing to drink from an invisible pool. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists, Fifty Years' (through Dec. 31) The Met's latest foray into recent art will undoubtedly be a crowd-pleaser, not the least for the mini-Warhol retrospective of 50 works that forms its spine. But with 100 often significant works by 59 other relentlessly predictable artists -- including Gerhard Richter, Cindy Sherman and Jeff Koons -- it is largely a shapeless, enthusiastic muddle. A dismaying return to the great-man, über-artist approach to art history, it does little to diminish the perception that where new art is concerned, the Met has a very long way to go. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Tomás Saraceno on the Roof: Cloud City' (through Nov. 4) This climbable 28-foot-high aggregate of 16 interconnected polyhedrons made of reflective steel and clear plexiglass creates a kind of Piranesian, walk-in Cubism that is briefly disorienting, but ultimately decorative. The none-too-high standards of participatory fun-house formalism are met; those of conventional plop art are barely exceeded. In the fusion of architecture, art and science, art is the loser, but the views of Central Park's ocean of greenness thrill, providing an immense and calming relief to the work's forced and busy artifice. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Chinese Gardens: Pavilions, Studios, Retreats' (through Jan. 6) To anyone strolling through the Chinese painting galleries at the Met this summer, the whole world will look like a garden of infinite expansion. That's the impression given by the 80 paintings and objects that make up this fragrant exhibition, drawn entirely from the museum's deep holdings, about paradises lost and found; about nature blooming and fading; about cosmological events transpiring in backyard bamboo groves. Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Arts and Design: 'Doris Duke's Shangri-La: Architecture, Landscape and Islamic Art' (through Feb. 17) The Honolulu estate known as Shangri La is a masterpiece of refined eclecticism. Doris Duke, the owner, referred to it as a ''Spanish-Moorish-Persian-Indian complex.'' Whatever you call it, it looks magnificent in this show and the accompanying book. Both combine sparkling new color shots of the home and gardens taken by Tim Street-Porter; architectural documents and vintage photographs; pieces of the collection; and projects by contemporary artists who had residencies at Shangri La (which has served, since Duke's death in 1993, as the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art). 2 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Born Out of Necessity' (through Jan. 28) The title may or may not have an extra preposition, but the show itself is a fascinating array of recent acquisitions that have a fairly direct bearing on quality of life or actual survival. They range from classic (the 1908 Dixie cup) to cutting edge; cover both analog and digital; and include the tiny (the latest in earplugs) and the quite large (the 1952 United States Army Jeep). Whether born ''of'' or ''out of'' necessity, the displays attest to human ingenuity responding to human need. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Quay Brothers: On Deciphering the Pharmacist's Prescription for Lip-Reading Puppets' (through Jan. 7) The first major museum retrospective devoted to the strange puppet-haunted universe unleashed in the Quay Brothers' stop-action film animations includes their magical miniature stage sets, a sizable sampling of drawings, prints, collages and early illustration designs as well as works by artists who influenced them. More than 30 years of animated and live-action shorts, television commercials, music videos and imaginative documentaries in particular allow devotees and neophytes alike to grasp the essence of Timothy and Stephen Quay's achievement and its evolution, strengths and weaknesses all. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Century of the Child: Growing by Design, 1900 -- 2000' (through Nov. 5) This big, wonderful show at the Museum of Modern Art examines the intersection of modern design and modern thinking about children. A richly thought-provoking study of a great subject, it is loaded with intriguing things to look at -- some 500 items, including furniture, toys, games, posters, books and much more. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through March 11) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Martha Schwendener)
Museum of the City of New York: 'London Street Photography' (through Dec. 2) Arriving from the Museum of London, which presented it in 2010 and owns the more than 150 works on view, this exhibition affords those of us watching the Olympics on TV a glimpse of an older, more eccentric city. It covers the Victorian era to the present, and is particularly rich in images from the mid-20th century. A smaller companion exhibition, ''City Scenes: Highlights of New York Street Photography,'' provides an opportunity to compare and contrast two very different modern cities as they grappled with war, the postindustrial era and various forms of social tension. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Neue Galerie: 'Ferdinand Hodler: View to Infinity' (through Jan. 7) Near the end of this exhibition you come to a small, chapel-like room containing a painting from 1915 of Ferdinand Hodler's longtime model and lover Valentine Godé-Darel on her deathbed; three small, vibrantly colored landscapes; and a self-portrait. Thus ring the basic themes that unfold in this extraordinarily touching show of late works by the Swiss Symbolist: Self, Other, Love, Death and World. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Candid: The Lens and Life of Homai Vyarawalla' (through Jan. 14) The Indian photojournalist Homai Vyarawalla (1913-2012) was on the spot time and again to record the history of modern South Asia being made. This small, evocative, event-filled retrospective catches highlights of her career, including her coverage of Mohandas Gandhi's funeral; important events in the career of the charismatic Jawaharlal Nehru; and visits from Nikita Khrushchev, Ho Chi Minh and Jacqueline Kennedy. As one of the few female photographers in the Indian press corps in her day, Ms. Vyarawalla was a pioneer; in 1970 she abruptly put down her camera and disappeared until her recent rediscovery by younger peers. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; South Street Seaport Museum: 'Compass: Folk Art in Four Directions' (through Jan. 3) The American Folk Art Museum presents some 200 works from its unparalleled collection in this beautifully orchestrated exhibition. Paintings, sculpture, textiles, scrimshaw, painted furniture and much, much more are arrayed along themes that reflect the history of Lower Manhattan -- seafaring, commerce, social life and that all-important factor, the weather -- but not too tightly. Poetic license is taken, yielding an intricate constellation of connected artworks, histories and concerns that highlights one of the city's great treasures. 12 Fulton Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 748-8600, southstreetseaportmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Caribbean: Crossroads of the World' (through Oct. 21) In size, cultural scope and freshness of material, the three-museum exhibition ''Caribbean: Crossroads of the World'' is the big art event of the summer season in New York City, itself one of the largest Caribbean cities in the world. Be warned: the thematically arranged show throws you into history at the deep end. Almost all the information is strictly visual; there are very few explanatory labels anywhere. But the visuals are so rich, and interact so provocatively, that you may well be inspired to go out and do some homework and come back for a second look. 144 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. Also on display: through Jan. 6 at El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org; and through Jan. 6 at Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Primary Sources: Artists in Residence 2011-2012' (through Oct. 21) The accent is on Africa in the Studio Museum's latest artist-in-residence showcase. Two of the three participants were born there -- Njideka Akunyili in Nigeria in 1983, Meleko Mokgosi in Botswana in 1981 -- and their experience of it is a wellspring for very different and accomplished kinds of painting. The show's third artist, Xaviera Simmons, born in New York City in 1974, plays audacious photographic games with the African in African-American, and proves herself once again, as she has in the past, a thinker's artist. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Fireflies on the Water' (through Oct. 28) The museum's retrospective of the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama has closed but visitors can still view this 2002 installation, which depicts a seemingly endless space. It's a carefully constructed environment of lights, mirrors and water in which viewers can transcend their very sense of self. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Wade Guyton: OS' (through Jan. 13) Something of a rarity this fall season, a beautiful, thoughtfully staged show makes a cogent case for a young painter with no overt political ax to grind working in New York. Made entirely with computer, scanner and printer -- the OS refers to computer operating systems -- his works methodically explore the possibilities of technology as just another if especially up-to-date paintbrush. The results are full of glitches and irregularities that provide their own pictorial life, full of the ghosts of painting past and strikingly original. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Oskar Fischinger: Space Light Art -- A Film Environment' (through Oct. 28) Projected on three adjoining screens, ''Light Space Art'' floods your retinas with intensely colorful, pulsating circles, flowing lines and blinking rectangles. A found film clip shows a spinning globe and the momentary, cartoon apparition of a young girl in a hooded, fur-trimmed coat. Oskar Fischinger created the original film footage in Weimar-era Germany. Newly restored and digitized, it still generates an exhilarating phantasmagoria of abstraction and metaphor. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Johnson)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Signs & Symbols' (through Oct. 28) In the 1950s, Americans were running out of ways to keep their works new and responsive to a world shaken to the core by World War II. For some the solution was passive-aggressive withdrawal into archaic myth, oracular symbolism and private language. Sampling this trend with works from the Whitney's permanent collection, this show presents lugubriously portentous paintings by hall of famers like Rothko and Pollock and by many journeyman players like Mark Tobey and Forrest Bess.

&#x2605; 'Echoes of the Past: The Buddhist Cave Temples of Xiangtangshan' (through Jan. 6) In the Buddhist way of thinking, all things must pass, though that seems a shame if they're as out-of-this-world beautiful as Chinese Buddhist art is. But could that vision of transience be changing in the 21st century, as still-crude technology lets images live on out there in digital clouds? Regret and hope alike run through this multifaceted show that presents a dozen gorgeous sixth-century sculptures and a digital simulation of the cave temple in China from which some of them were long ago removed.

Jonah Freeman and Justin Lowe: 'Stray Light Grey' (through Oct. 27) Your journey through this immersive installation begins in a janitor's closet. From there you pass through a grungy bathroom, an abandoned Off Track Betting parlor, a plastic surgeon's office and a store stocked with nutritional supplements like ''DNA Recalibrator.'' Finally you emerge into a library displaying fake books with titles like ''The Decorated Slave State'' and ''Fun With Your Interneurons.'' You may wish you could see the unmade movie for which all this would make an excellent set. Marlborough Chelsea, 545 West 25th Street, (212) 463-8634, marlboroughchelsea.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; 'Distance and Desire': 'Encounters with the African Archive, Part I: Santu Mofokeng and A.M. Duggan-Cronin' (through Nov. 17) Born in Ireland in 1874, Alfred Martin Duggan-Cronin photographed in South Africa until his death in 1954, creating a multivolume book -- a record of indigenous peoples and of ways of life that he feared were disappearing. In 1997, Santu Mofokeng, born in Johannesburg in 1956, completed a book-length compilation of urban African studio portraits dating to the colonial era. The Duggan-Cronin photographs, seen in mounted pages from his books in this show, perpetuate an old view of Africans as being, by definition, rural, tradition-bound, on the verge of extinction. The studio portraits gathered in Mr. Mofokeng's archive present Africans as they chose to see themselves, as global citizens with modern histories.

Gelitin: 'The Fall Show' (through Nov. 13) In a sardonic jibe at our money-crazed times and the preciousness of the art object, the congenitally disruptive Austrian collective exhibits 17 assemblage sculptures on rigged pedestals that send the works crashing to the floor with the press of a lever. Whether participating viewers are completing or destroying the art is an interesting question, but the resulting mayhem is definitely disconcerting. Greene Naftali, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 463-7770, greenenaftaligallery.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Thomas Hirschhorn: 'Concordia Concordia' (through Oct. 20) In his latest show in Chelsea the Swiss installation artist Thomas Hirschhorn serves up a spectacle from recent headlines: the wreck in January of the Costa Concordia cruise ship along the Italian coastline, which killed 32 people. A few small touches connect ''Concordia, Concordia'' to Mr. Hirschhorn's earlier walk-in, agitprop-laced installations: a print of Géricault's ''Raft of the Medusa,'' scattered pages from ''Das Kapital'' and flat-screen televisions playing video of news broadcasts about the disaster. But these critical interventions are fairly subtle; over all, the installation looks less like a work by Mr. Hirschhorn than like a set from the inevitable Concordia movie. Gladstone Gallery, 530 West 21st Street, (212) 206-7606, gladstonegallery.com. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Thomas Hirschhorn: 'Timeline: Work in Public Space' (through Nov. 3) Running concurrently with his installation at Gladstone Gallery, Thomas Hirschhorn's ''Timeline: Work in Public Space'' is a dense collage of text and photos that guides you through Mr. Hirschhorn's public artworks. (It's a prelude to his ''Gramsci Monument,'' a Dia project in the Bronx that's slated for summer 2013.) The jumble of texts, photographs and diagrams looks provisional, which suits the unfinished space and, more important, Mr. Hirschhorn's ideas about public art (a term he likes to disparage, saying, ''Art is public''). Dia:Chelsea, 541 West 22nd Street, (212) 989-5566, diaart.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Ralph Humphrey (through Oct. 20) With rich, soft colors, abrasive, stucco-like surfaces and boxy, built-out forms, the painter Ralph Humphrey (1932-1990) put his own idiosyncratic spin on longstanding formalist concerns. He pit the retinal against the physical and pushed the modernist monochrome toward representation with results at once comic and subtly elegiac. This survey of works form the 1970s and '80s should encourage a museum show. Gary Snyder Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-1351, garysnyderart.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Jesper Just: 'This Nameless Spectacle' (through Oct. 27) Grand mal, la petit mort or divine revelation? The question lingers in the wake of Mr. Just's astounding, 13-minute video ''This Nameless Spectacle.'' On opposite walls, two extremely wide-screen projections follow the peregrinations of a woman rolling herself along in a wheelchair in Paris followed by a young man who might be a stalker and might be an incarnation of the demigod Eros. The climax resembles a scene from David Lynch's ''Inland Empire.'' James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212) 714-9500, jamescohan.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; 'Kindergarten' (through Oct. 20) This edifying show, which complements the early galleries of the Museum of Modern Art's ''Century of the Child'' exhibition, explores the playful exercises in abstraction that used to be de rigeur for children younger than 7. Devised by the 19th-century German educator Friedrich Froebel, these early explorations of color, shape and pattern -- called Froebel Gifts -- influenced many a grown-up modernist. Paul Klee, Le Corbusier and Josef Albers were all kindergartners. Ricco Maresca Gallery, 29 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4819, riccomaresca.com. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Elad Lassry: 'Untitled (Presence)' (through Oct. 20) In his seductive and thought-provoking solo at the Kitchen, Mr. Lassry nudges photography ever closer to time-based mediums like film and dance. Some of his ideas go back to the Bauhaus and to photographic pioneers like Muybridge, but Mr. Lassry's strong personal aesthetic keeps things in the moment. The show, which was accompanied by performances in September, transforms the gallery into a layered, compressed and unmistakably photographic space with wall cutouts that afford fragmentary glimpses of Mr. Lassry's photographs and photo objects. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org. (Rosenberg)
Paul Pfeiffer: 'Playroom' (through Oct. 20) In this spare exhibition of new work, his first New York solo since 2007, Paul Pfeiffer picks up right where he left off: with videos digitally edited to ''erase'' key figures and objects, and related sculpture and photographs with similarly eerie bodies in absentia. The four-minute looped video ''100 Point Game'' (presented as a 16-millimeter film) deploys footage from basketball games; it shows empty nets shuddering as the balls -- removed by Mr. Pfeiffer -- pass through. Also related to basketball, the sculpture ''Playroom'' presents a dollhouse-size version of a mirrored, fur-and-velvet-upholstered, pentagonal room in Wilt Chamberlain's Los Angeles mansion. Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Guido van der Werve: 'Nummer veertien, home' (through Oct. 20) This Dutch artist's latest -- and 14th -- feat of poetic, often musically accompanied (filmed) endurance art involved running, swimming and bicycling from Warsaw to Paris to deliver Polish soil to Frédéric Chopin's grave. The act is accomplished to the strains of a requiem mass composed by Mr. van der Werve and performed by various orchestras and choirs along the route. The music and landscape vistas account for possibly too much of the effect, but the artist's stoic, self-abnegating devotion has its own power.

Galleries: SoHo
Bernadette Corporation: '2000 Wasted Years' (through Dec. 16) A Warholian spoof of branding, publicity and media, this retrospective of the influential collaborative known as the Bernadette Corporation is depressingly arch. Resembling an ultra-hip design and fashion firm's showroom, the installation includes mannequins in avant-garde clothes; videos of runway shows; scarves and other accessories produced by the Bernadette Corporation; conceptually pointed publications; and a trailer for a documentary about the riots during the 2001 G-8 summit in Genoa with commentary by the actress Chloë Sevigny.

Galleries: Other
&#x2605; Tony Conrad: 'Doing the City: Urban Community Interventions' (through Nov. 3) Tony Conrad has slowly been emerging from avant-gardist obscurity, and it's about time. His multifold career -- as experimental film and video maker, composer, musician and sound artist -- still looks radical and prescient a half-century after it began. This show includes haunting 1969 sound pieces, and films and videos made in the past and finished in the present. 80WSE Gallery, New York University, 80 Washington Square East, (212) 998-5747, steinhardt.nyu.edu/80wse. (Cotter)
&#x2605; 'A Disagreeable Object' (through Nov. 26) This group show uses a phrase from Giacometti to lend some context to a present in which casual attitudes toward sculpture have become commonplace and plenty of value, material and otherwise, is attached to objects without pedestals. The main point here is a new-old one: what looks like cheerful insouciance about the art object is actually a deadly serious reaction to the vagaries of war, technology and the economy. SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Rosenberg)
'The Islands of Benoît Mandelbrot: Fractals, Chaos, and the Materiality of Thinking' (through Jan. 27) This heady, compact exhibition presents efforts from the 1960s and '70s to visualize a species of mathematical formulas known as fractals, a term coined by the mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot (1924-2012). The visual impact of the computer printouts, short films, 3-D models, letters, sketches and Polaroids on display is low, but the philosophical import is great considering the enormous advances in scientific imaging technology that have happened since those early days. Bard Graduate Center, 18 West 86th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3023, bgc.bard.edu. (Johnson)
'Monet's Garden' (through Oct. 21) From 1883 to the end of his life in 1926, Claude Monet presided over his estate in Giverny, working at flower gardening with as much industry and creativity as he did on his paintings. The main attraction here is a living abbreviated approximation of the two major gardens that he designed and planted: one in traditional, orderly French style, the other a Japanese-inspired fantasia of water, blooming water lilies and weeping willows. It is far from the real thing, but there are moments of astounding beauty. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway (Exit 7W) and Fordham Road, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700, nybg.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info. (Smith)
&#x2605; Penny Slinger: 'An Exorcism Revisited' (through Nov. 30) Born in England, Penny Slinger emerged from art school in 1969, a time when lots of liberations were under way, including the nascent women's movement. The earliest works in her first New York solo are six short films from that year. They're student pieces, but pretty out there for the time. The main piece is her still unpublished book of photo-collages and texts called ''An Exorcism.'' A blend of ''Rebecca'' and ''Story of O,'' it's yet another reminder of the adventure that feminist art in the 1960s and '70s was. Broadway 1602, 1181 Broadway, Third Floor, (212) 481-0362, broadway1602.com. (Cotter)
Toxic Beauty: 'The Art of Frank Moore' (through Dec. 8) This lavishly detailed retrospective pays tribute to a multifaceted career in painting, set design, film and political activism that was cut short by AIDS in 2002, when the artist was 48. In a time -- the 1980s and '90s -- when some artists re-embraced representational painting and others tackled thorny political topics, Moore did both, and with unusual flair, reviving and revising a panoply of outré realist styles in luminous allegorical canvases that comment on, and link, environmental degradation and the tragedy of AIDS.

Andra Ursuta: 'Magical Terrorism' (through Oct. 21) This Romanian-born New York artist's second solo show is another rambunctious, haunted affair, this one framed in two acts of possible terrorism: the gallery's shattered front windows and its crumpled back wall, seemingly rammed by an ancient cart opulently encrusted in silver foam. In between marble figures and -- especially striking -- several cast metal African-esque torsos are decked out in elaborate coin chokers; this grouping conjures conflicting systems of belief, economics and display, as well as a world whose center is not holding.

Public Art
'Common Ground' (through Nov. 30) Located on a site known in the 17th century as the Commons -- which also served as the site of Bloombergville, the precursor to Occupy Wall Street one year ago -- this show offers some incendiary critiques. Ian Hamilton Finlay's group of stone slabs arranged on a patch of grass includes inscriptions from the writings of Louis de Saint-Just (1767-94), a French Revolutionary leader. Paul McCarthy's ''Daddies Ketchup'' (2001), a huge inflatable bottle of ketchup makes a Neo-Pop-psychoanalytic connection between patriarchy and power, and Elmgreen & Dragset's aluminum bullhorn housed in a slick, industrial vitrine evokes protesters in Zuccotti Park, who were forbidden from using any amplification devices, developed a signature form of analogue augmentation, the ''people's microphone.'' City Hall Park, Public Art Fund, (212) 223-7800, publicartfund.org. (Schwendener)
&#x2605; Tatzu Nishi: 'Discovering Columbus' (through Nov. 18) In his first commission in the United States, a Japanese artist known for temporarily privatizing monuments and landmarks across the globe by building fully outfitted living rooms or hotel suites around them, takes on the statue of Christopher Columbus perched above Columbus Circle. A free timed ticket and a six-story climb (or elevator ride) yields the semi-Surreal sight of the sculpture presiding over an upscale living room. But the ravishing views may be the main treat. Open daily, from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., at Columbus Circle, West 59th Street and Broadway. Free tickets available at publicartfund.org, (866) 607-5461 or the information desk at the Shops at Columbus Circle, third floor. (Smith)
Out of Town
&#x2605; Robert Adams: 'The Place We Live, A Retrospective Selection of Photographs' (through Oct. 28) A prophet in the wilderness of modernity, the photographer Robert Adams has devoted almost five decades to decrying what fecklessly industrious humans have done to the landscape of the American West. This splendid retrospective show of more than 250 prints dating from the late 1960s to 2009 surveys an oeuvre that is as compelling for its understated metaphorical resonance as for its moral ferocity. Yale University Art Gallery, 111 Chapel Street, New Haven, (203) 432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu. (Johnson)
'Anti-Establishment' (through Dec. 21) Contrary to this muddled exhibition's title, the artists it presents are not uncompromising rebels. The show's curator, Johanna Burton, avers that they imagine ''novel collective relationships and emergent models of engaged citizenship,'' but much of the work is more self-reflexively preoccupied with art than with worldly affairs. Best of all is a room full of Abstract Expressionist-style paintings made with Day-Glo paints by Jacqueline Humphries displayed under ultra violet light. It is a lushly visual trip. Hessel Museum of Art, Bard College Center for Curatorial Studies, Annandale-on-Hudson, (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Johnson)
Bowdoin College Museum of Art: 'William Wegman: Hello Nature' (through Oct. 21) As its title implies, this beguiling show surveys the erstwhile Conceptual pioneer's lifelong attachment to nature, especially as evidenced in his characteristically witty, offhand works of the past two decades. Included are drawings, collages, photographs and altered photographs, as well as photographs and a 25-minute movie featuring his signature, endlessly cooperative Weimaraners. Also on hand are numerous examples of his efforts in painting, which he took up again in 1985, made with and without postcards. Bowdoin College Museum of Art, 9400 College Station, Brunswick, Maine, (207) 725-3275, bowdoin.edu/art-museum. (Smith)
'From 199A to 199B: Liam Gillick' (through Dec. 21) Mr. Gillick is a nearly ubiquitous figure on the international art scene as a conceptual artist, speaker, writer and collaborator with other luminaries like Rirkrit Tiravanija and Pierre Huyghe. He designs shiny, quasi-architectural sculptures for sale in commercial galleries, but here the focus is on politically motivated conceptual projects from the 1990s. If sociology and ideology are your things, this show is for you. Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Johnson)
Institute of Contemporary Art, Pennsylvania: 'Jeremy Deller: Joy in People' (through Dec. 30) The British artist Jeremy Deller, the subject of this thought-provoking show, is the anti-Damien Hirst. He has fashioned a Turner Prize-winning career devoted to breaking down the traditional walls between art and the world at large. Rather than producing visually arresting objects for sale in antiseptic galleries he has organized parades; created odd signs and bumper stickers; made a film about Depeche Mode fans around the world; and orchestrated a historical re-enactment of a large, violent conflict between striking coal miners and police in Orgreave, in South Yorkshire, in 1984. University of Pennsylvania, 118 South 36th Street, Philadelphia, (215) 898-7108, icaphila.org. (Johnson)
'Light and Landscape' (through Nov. 11) Temporary exhibitions at this bucolic art park have not been notably cutting edge, but this show of Postmodernist sculptures relating to light organized by the center's new associate curator, Nora Lawrence, may signal a promising change in the program. It includes indoor works by Roni Horn, Alyson Shotz and Diana Thater and elaborate outdoor constructions by Spencer Finch and William Lamson. Most surprising is Peter Coffin's ''Untitled (Sunshine),'' which consists of four loud speakers attached to a tall pole on a grassy hill broadcasting sunny keyboard melodies composed and performed by the jazz musician Bob James. Storm King Art Center, Old Pleasant Hill Road, Mountainville, N.Y., (845) 534-3115, stormkingartcenter.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art: 'Oh Canada' (through April 13) Seesawing between bigness and intimacy, the personal and the communal, this 62-artist survey of contemporary art in the Great White North may tell you more about Canada's identity crisis than it does about Canadian art. A sense of place, if not nationhood, does emerge in stark photographs of Newfoundland by Ned Pratt and Kim Morgan's hanging latex cast of a lighthouse on Prince Edward Island. Elsewhere, cartoonlike pencil drawings by Annie Pootoogook and Shuvinai Ashoona depict contemporary Inuit life and the artist Amalie Atkins stars in a prairie fairy tale involving musical wolves and bears with golden teeth. 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, (413) 662-2111, massmoca.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; National Museum of African Art: 'African Cosmos: Stellar Arts' (through Dec. 9) Packed with celestial bodies and patches of darkness sending forth light, this show is about the extent and persistence of cosmological consciousness in art, old and new, from the African continent. It's also a bold demonstration of a more specific reality: that in Africa, art and science, including astronomy, have always intersected, and continue to, whether in prayers on an ancient Egyptian mummy case asking that the deceased owner be lifted to the stars or in a contemporary video projection that simulates the aurora borealis. Visitors to the National Museum of African Art should also take in the smart, stimulating reinstallation of the permanent collection. Smithsonian Institution, 950 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, (202) 633-4600, africa.si.edu. (Cotter)
Last Chance
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Josef Albers in America: Painting on Paper' (closes on Sunday) Yoga was probably far from Josef Albers's mind when he was working on the series of color-saturated paintings he called ''Homage to the Square.'' But deep meditation, in the form of hard work, was built into the project, which went on for a quarter of a century. And the bliss of hard work is the subject of this beautiful show about an artist's hands-on research and learning-as-you go experimentation. Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
National Gallery of Art: 'Elegance and Refinement: The Still-Life Paintings of Willem van Aelst' (closes on Sunday) Still-life painting bloomed like never before in the Netherlands in the 17th century, and among its most coveted blossoms were those of Willem van Aelst (1627-83), the subject of this small, intense exhibition of 28 paintings. Van Aelst painted the sorts of objects customary among his fellow still-life producers -- flowers in ornate, precious vases; ripe fruit; dead game animals; and hunting gear -- achieving at best a nearly hallucinatory realism. Constitution Avenue NW, between Third and Ninth Streets, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Johnson)
Gerhard Richter: 'Painting 2012' (closes on Saturday) Gerhard Richter's newest works, titled ''Strip Paintings,'' pursue Conceptual painting (a category Richter practically invented) to logical but deeply unsatisfying ends. Each consists of narrow, horizontal striations, all derived from a single painting (''Abstract Painting 724-4,'' 1990) in a viral process of subdivision, mirroring, recombination and repetition. The final works are unique digital prints that, despite their painterly lineage, are beholden to digital space. Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 977-7160, mariangoodman.com. (Rosenberg)
Rubin Museum of Art: 'Modernist Art From India: Approaching Abstraction' (closes on Tuesday) This show, the second in a series of three more or less consecutive exhibitions on Indian modernism of the postcolonial period, finds Indian painters gradually and selectively moving away from the figure -- both on canvas and, sometimes, in experiments with film. ''Abstraction,'' here, isn't always formal; it can mean breaking with narrative, as in Tyeb Mehta's film ''Koodal,'' which combines images of cows headed for slaughter, crowds massing at Gandhi's funeral, and the gyrations of a self-flagellating dancer. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; 'Ruptures: Forms of Public Address' (closes on Saturday) With presidential elections nearing, and Occupy Wall Street struggling to maintain its punch, a fresh surge of political consciousness-raising has to be a good idea. That's the premise behind this group show of socially alert art that's less an attack on specific issues than a call to interruptive action as a political end in itself. 41 Cooper Gallery, Third Avenue, between Sixth and Seventh Streets, (212) 353-4100, cooper.edu. (Cotter)
Mary Weatherford: 'Manhattan' (closes on Sunday) While suggesting a calculated, even desperate combination of received ideas -- namely the washy stained colors of Helen Frankenthaler and the early 1970s neon wall pieces of the sculptor Keith Sonnier -- the latest efforts by this abstract painter are unexpectedly convincing. Electric and liquid color prove mutually enhancing and, with loose brushwork stopping well short of the canvas edges and wiring in full view, the overall roughness of execution makes the works as much installation pieces as paintings. Brennan & Griffin, 55 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 227-0115, brennangriffin.com. (Smith)
Eric Yahnker: 'Virgin Birth 'N' Turf' (closes on Saturday) Mr. Yahnker skewers the usual and not-so-usual suspects from politics and entertainment in drawings great and small. He is also an ambitious, prolific and technically impressive draftsman. Working with graphite and colored pencil, he creates photo-derived images sometimes reaching over eight feet high giving heft to otherwise slight one-liners like the image of a beleaguered Jesus reading a book by Representative Michele Bachmann, a Minnesota Republican, called ''Core of Conviction.''

HEADLINE: Andrew Brimmer, 86, First Black on Fed

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Andrew F. Brimmer, a Louisiana sharecropper's son who was the first black member of the Federal Reserve Board and who led efforts to to reverse the country's balance-of-payments deficit, died on Sunday in Washington. He was 86.
His death, after a long illness, was confirmed by his daughter, Esther Brimmer. 
Dr. Brimmer, an economist, held a number of high-ranking posts in Washington and taught at Harvard, but the economic conditions of poor, powerless, uneducated blacks was an abiding concern. He spoke about what he called the ''schism'' between blacks who were educated and had marketable skills and those who did not. In later years he spoke frequently about how government policies no longer supported programs to help blacks enter the economic mainstream.
Dr. Brimmer was the assistant secretary of commerce for economic affairs when President Lyndon B. Johnson named him to the Fed board in 1966.
At the time, the Federal Reserve was bitterly divided over monetary policy. The chairman, William McChesney Martin Jr., threatened to resign if Mr. Johnson appointed a liberal who would vote in favor of lower interest rates.
At Dr. Brimmer's swearing-in ceremony, the president said he did not expect Dr. Brimmer to be ''an easy money man or a tight money man.'' Rather, Mr. Johnson said, ''I expect him to be a right money man.''
The Wall Street Journal expressed skepticism, with a front-page article headlined ''Desire to Aid Negroes Could Make New 'Fed' Member More Liberal.'' It quoted an anonymous source saying that the appointment was yet another example of Mr. Johnson's political foxiness. ''The president has Martin in a box,'' the source told The Journal. ''If Martin resigned now, it would look like it was because he didn't want a Negro on the board.''
Early in his tenure, Dr. Brimmer followed the lead of Mr. Martin and other ''tight money'' board members by supporting a gradual increase in interest rates to fight inflation. But when Congress raised taxes in 1968 and cut spending to cut inflation, he was one of the first Fed governors to call for lowering rates.
At the Commerce Department, Dr. Brimmer's primary responsibility was to reverse the country's balance-of-payments deficit. He spent a good deal of time persuading American businesses to voluntarily slow their use of dollars in foreign investments. He also encouraged foreign companies to use their own currency to make investments in the United States.
In a speech in December 1965, he reported that his efforts had resulted in a drop in direct American investments overseas, to $515 million in the third quarter of that year from $1.12 billion in the first quarter.
That work built on his interest in foreign affairs, which started when he went to India with the Fulbright Program and wrote papers on the Indian economy.
As a staff economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the late 1950s, he was part of a team that visited Sudan to explore the feasibility of a central bank there. He later wrote an article on banking and finance in Sudan for The South African Journal of Economics. He became known as the international monetary policy expert on the Federal Reserve Board.
Dr. Brimmer served a little more than eight years of his 14-year term, leaving the board in 1974 to join the faculty of the Harvard Business School and start a consulting firm, Brimmer & Company. His academic career also included study in India at the Delhi School of Economics and the University of Bombay.
In 1995, he was chosen to head a five-member financial control board to help the District of Columbia deal with a financial crisis. He stepped down after a contentious three years in the job.
Andrew Felton Brimmer Jr. was born on Sept. 13, 1926, in Newellton, La. After graduating from high school he went to Washington State, where one of his sisters lived. He joined the Army near the end of World War II and attained the rank of staff sergeant, remaining in the United States.
Besides his daughter, who is the assistant secretary for international organization affairs at the State Department, he is survived by his wife, Doris Scott Brimmer.
Dr. Brimmer attended the University of Washington in Seattle on the G.I. Bill of Rights, earning an undergraduate degree in economics in 1950 and a master's degree the next year.
He then went to India before attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, where he earned a doctorate. In 1965, Dr. Brimmer was part of a federal delegation sent to Los Angeles after rioting in the Watts neighborhood left 34 people dead and tens of millions of dollars in property damage. He commissioned a Census Bureau study that found that the purchasing power of the average family in Watts had declined by $400 in the five years before the riots while incomes had risen in the rest of America.
''I do feel that the economic plight of blacks is a serious matter,'' he told The New York Times in 1973. ''So I bring the same economist's tool kit to that subject as other economists bring to examine other national economic problems.''

HEADLINE: Tribes Add Potent Voice Against Plan for Northwest Coal Terminals

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
FERNDALE, Wash. -- At age 94, Mary Helen Cagey, an elder of the Lummi Indian tribe, has seen a lot of yesterdays. Some are ripe for fond reminiscence, like the herring that used to run rich in the waters here in the nation's upper-left margin, near the border with Canada. Others are best left in the past, she said, like coal.
''I used to travel into Bellingham and buy my sack of coal,'' she said, standing in sensible shoes on a pebbled beach at a recent tribal news conference, talking about her girlhood of rural subsistence and occasional trips to the nearby market town. The idea that coal producers would make a comeback bid, with a huge export shipping terminal proposed at a site where she once fished, called Cherry Point, is simply wrong, she said. ''It's something that should not come about,'' Ms. Cagey said. 
Many environmental groups and green-minded politicians in the Pacific Northwest are already on record as opposing a wave of export terminals proposed from here to the south-central coast of Oregon, aiming to ship coal to Asia. But in recent weeks, Indian tribes have been linking arms as well, citing possible injury to fishing rights and religious and sacred sites if the coal should spill or the dust from its trains and barges should waft too thick.
And as history has demonstrated over and over, especially in this part of the nation, from protecting fish habitats to removing dams, a tribal-environmental alliance goes far beyond good public relations. The cultural claims and treaty rights that tribes can wield -- older and materially different, Indian law experts say, than any argument that the Sierra Club or its allies might muster about federal air quality rules or environmental review -- add a complicated plank of discussion that courts and regulators have found hard to ignore.
Lummi tribal leaders recently burned a mock million-dollar check in a ceremonial statement that money could never buy their cooperation. Last month, the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, a regional congress of more than 50 tribes in seven states, passed a resolution demanding a collective environmental impact statement for the proposed ports, rather than project-by-project statements, which federal regulators have suggested.
Leaders of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, which focuses on fishing rights, said in a statement in support of the resolution that moving millions of tons of coal through the region could affect a range of issues, like road traffic and economic life on the reservations, not to mention the environment.
''It brings another set of issues to the table,'' said Gov. John Kitzhaber of Oregon, a Democrat who earlier this year asked for a broad federal environmental review that would examine implications of the coal plan from transit through the region by train or barge to the burning of the coal in China. The tribes, Mr. Kitzhaber said, have now added a voice that even a governor cannot match. ''It definitely increases the pressure,'' he said.
Coal producers across the nation have been wounded by a sharp drop in demand in the United States -- down 16.3 percent in the period from April through June, compared with the same period in 2011, to the lowest quarterly level since 2005, according to the most recent federal figures. With prices falling and abundant supplies of natural gas flowing because of new fields and drilling technologies, especially hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, many electricity producers that can switch are doing so.
That has made coal exports, which have increased this year in every region of the country except the West, according to federal figures, even more crucial to the industry than they were when the six terminals on the Pacific Coast were first proposed. Jason Hayes, a spokesman for the American Coal Council, said that with coal-producing nations like Australia and Indonesia competing for Asian markets, a roadblock on the West Coast is an issue for the entire American economy.
The first public hearings for the terminal projects, conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers, are set to begin this month in Bellingham, near the Lummi reservation.
''The people that can produce efficiently and can ship quickly and reliably -- those are the big things -- they are going to be the ones that are chosen for being reliable business partners,'' Mr. Hayes said. ''If we can build the ports on the West Coast, then it just becomes that much more reliable.''
But by coincidence of history, geography, culture and law, the West Coast, especially Washington and Oregon, is also a center for Indian tribe muscle, legal scholars said.
Although many tribes around the nation received rights to hunt and fish in the treaty language of the 1800s that consigned them to reservations, few places had a focus on a single resource -- fish, especially from the Columbia River and its tributaries -- that tribes here did. They also, crucially, persisted in using the resources that the treaties had granted them; fishing did not become a hobby or a cultural artifact.
Then, in the 1970s, when the Indian rights and environmental movements were both surging, tribal timing was fortuitous in pushing court cases that reinforced their claims.
''They made really good use of those rights, and have become major players,'' said Sarah Krakoff, a law professor at the University of Colorado who teaches Indian law and natural resources law. Tribal rights have been a cornerstone in the long battle over restoring salmon stocks in the Columbia River. This year, one of the biggest dam removal projects in the nation's history reached a milestone when a section of the Elwha River near Olympic National Park in Washington was restored to wild flow, with fishing rights an important driver in the process.
Coal has also become an element in the presidential race, as energy executives have poured tens of millions of dollars into campaigns backing Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate, and accusing the Obama administration of harboring hostility to coal through tightened air pollution rules.
An executive order dating from the administration of Bill Clinton could give further ammunition to Northwest tribes in their coal fight, Professor Krakoff and other experts said. The order directs federal agencies to allow tribal access to sacred sites and to take into account religious practices in federal decision making.
Lummi leaders, in the protest this week where Ms. Cagey spoke, said the Cherry Point site in particular -- though partly developed years ago by industry, with a major oil refinery nearby -- is full of sacred sites and burial grounds. The tribe's hereditary chairman, Bill James, said in an interview, however, that the tribe would not reveal the locations of the graves for fear of looting.

HEADLINE: Panetta Warns Of Dire Threat Of Cyberattack

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER and THOM SHANKER; Elisabeth Bumiller reported from New York, and Thom Shanker from Washington.

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned Thursday that the United States was facing the possibility of a ''cyber-Pearl Harbor'' and was increasingly vulnerable to foreign computer hackers who could dismantle the nation's power grid, transportation system, financial networks and government.
In a speech at the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in New York, Mr. Panetta painted a dire picture of how such an attack on the United States might unfold. He said he was reacting to increasing aggressiveness and technological advances by the nation's adversaries, which officials identified as China, Russia, Iran and militant groups. 
''An aggressor nation or extremist group could use these kinds of cyber tools to gain control of critical switches,'' Mr. Panetta said. ''They could derail passenger trains, or even more dangerous, derail passenger trains loaded with lethal chemicals. They could contaminate the water supply in major cities, or shut down the power grid across large parts of the country.''
Defense officials insisted that Mr. Panetta's words were not hyperbole, and that he was responding to a recent wave of cyberattacks on large American financial institutions. He also cited an attack in August on the state oil company Saudi Aramco, which infected and made useless more than 30,000 computers.
But Pentagon officials acknowledged that Mr. Panetta was also pushing for legislation on Capitol Hill. It would require new standards at critical private-sector infrastructure facilities -- like power plants, water treatment facilities and gas pipelines -- where a computer breach could cause significant casualties or economic damage.
In August, a cybersecurity bill that had been one of the administration's national security priorities was blocked by a group of Republicans, led by Senator John McCain of Arizona, who took the side of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and said it would be too burdensome for corporations.
The most destructive possibilities, Mr. Panetta said, involve ''cyber-actors launching several attacks on our critical infrastructure at one time, in combination with a physical attack.'' He described the collective result as a ''cyber-Pearl Harbor that would cause physical destruction and the loss of life, an attack that would paralyze and shock the nation and create a profound new sense of vulnerability.''
Mr. Panetta also argued against the idea that new legislation would be costly for business. ''The fact is that to fully provide the necessary protection in our democracy, cybersecurity must be passed by the Congress,'' he told his audience, Business Executives for National Security. ''Without it, we are and we will be vulnerable.''
With the legislation stalled, Mr. Panetta said President Obama was weighing the option of issuing an executive order that would promote information sharing on cybersecurity between government and private industry. But Mr. Panetta made clear that he saw it as a stopgap measure and that private companies, which are typically reluctant to share internal information with the government, would cooperate fully only if required to by law.
''We're not interested in looking at e-mail, we're not interested in looking at information in computers, I'm not interested in violating rights or liberties of people,'' Mr. Panetta told editors and reporters at The New York Times earlier on Thursday. ''But if there is a code, if there's a worm that's being inserted, we need to know when that's happening.''
He said that with an executive order making cooperation by the private sector only voluntary, ''I'm not sure they're going to volunteer if they don't feel that they're protected legally in terms of sharing information.''
''So our hope is that ultimately we can get Congress to adopt that kind of legislation,'' he added.
Mr. Panetta's comments, his most extensive to date on cyberwarfare, also sought to increase the level of public debate about the Defense Department's growing capacity not only to defend but also to carry out attacks over computer networks. Even so, he carefully avoided using the words ''offense'' or ''offensive'' in the context of American cyberwarfare, instead defining the Pentagon's capabilities as ''action to defend the nation.''
The United States has nonetheless engaged in its own cyberattacks against adversaries, although it has never publicly admitted it. From his first months in office, Mr. Obama ordered sophisticated attacks on the computer systems that run Iran's main nuclear enrichment plants, according to participants in the program. He decided to accelerate the attacks, which were begun in the Bush administration and code-named Olympic Games, even after an element of the program accidentally became public in the summer of 2010.
In a part of the speech notable for carefully chosen words, Mr. Panetta warned that the United States ''won't succeed in preventing a cyberattack through improved defenses alone.''
''If we detect an imminent threat of attack that will cause significant physical destruction in the United States or kill American citizens, we need to have the option to take action against those who would attack us, to defend this nation when directed by the president,'' Mr. Panetta said. ''For these kinds of scenarios, the department has developed the capability to conduct effective operations to counter threats to our national interests in cyberspace.''
The comments indicated that the United States might redefine defense in cyberspace as requiring the capacity to reach forward over computer networks if an attack was detected or anticipated, and take pre-emptive action. These same offensive measures also could be used in a punishing retaliation for a first-strike cyberattack on an American target, senior officials said.
Senior Pentagon officials declined to describe specifics of what offensive cyberwarfare abilities the Defense Department has fielded or is developing. And while Mr. Panetta avoided labeling them as ''offensive,'' other senior military and Pentagon officials have recently begun acknowledging their growing focus on these tools.
The Defense Department is finalizing ''rules of engagement'' that would put the Pentagon's cyberweapons into play only in case of an attack on American targets that rose to some still unspecified but significant levels. Short of that, the Pentagon shares intelligence and offers technical assistance to the F.B.I. and other agencies.

&#x2605; American Ballet Theater (Tuesday through Friday; through Oct. 20) The real event of Ballet Theater's tantalizingly brief fall season is Thursday's premiere by artist in residence Alexei Ratmansky. Set to ''Symphony No. 9'' by Shostakovich, it will be the first part of a full evening of work that Mr. Ratmansky will choreograph to music by this composer, due to have its premiere during the company's spring season at the Metropolitan Opera House. No further clues have been given, but any new piece by Mr. Ratmansky is an occasion, and he has already shown a particular affinity with Shostakovich's music in his delightful ''Bright Stream.'' To make matters even more exciting, the work features Ballet Theater's newest international acquisition, Polina Semionova, alongside Marcelo Gomes. What will Mr. Ratmansky do with the glamorous, spitfire Ms. Semionova? 
 That burning question apart, the rest of the season looks fairly tame: a celebration of the 70th anniversary of ''Rodeo'' (I suppose we must); Mark Morris's ''Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes'' (enjoyable); a revival of José Limón's ''Moor's Pavane'' (worthy); Tudor's ''Leaves Are Fading'' (depends on the cast); Twyla Tharp's ''In the Upper Room'' (dependably exhilarating). The opening gala on Tuesday offers a few extras in the form of two pas de deux -- from Balanchine's ''Stars and Stripes'' and James Kudelka's ''Cruel World.'' But Ballet Theater is all about the dancing and the glorious dancers, which this season includes the heartthrob La Scala principal Roberto Bolle; on that front any program will offer rewards in plenty. Tuesday at 6:30 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., at City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $20 to $145. (Roslyn Sulcas)
Aspen Santa Fe Ballet (Tuesday through Thursday; through Oct. 21) This small company has made a name for itself as an adventurous repository of contemporary ballet choreography; not an easy position to take up in an economic climate that pressurizes ballet troupes to rely on box office favorites. For its New York season, the company brings no fewer than three newly commissioned works -- from Norbert de la Cruz, Alejandro Cerrudo and Jorma Elo. Mr. Elo is the only well-known name on this program, but that's all to the good; the ballet world waits with bated breath for new talent. Who knows? Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $75. (Sulcas)
&#x2605; Catch 53 (Saturday) This is what Andrew Dinwiddie, Jeff Larson and Caleb Hammons, the intrepid organizers of the Catch performance series, have to say about their 53rd edition: ''Mike Daisey! Jillian Peña! Geoff Sobelle! Sam Stonefield! Rebecca Warner! Ben Williams!'' And then, the telling detail: ''Beer included.'' Need I say more? At 8 p.m., the Invisible Dog (upstairs), 51 Bergen Street, Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, catchseries.org; $15. (Sulcas)
Sunhwa Chung / Ko-Ryo Dance Theater (Wednesday and Thursday; through Oct. 20) The Korean choreographer Sunhwa Chung presents an autobiographical piece, ''Arirang -- We Go Beyond the Crossroad,'' reflecting on her departure from her native country and life in another culture. Blending traditional Korean dance with contemporary forms, the piece offers live musical accompaniment by the Korean traditional drummer Vonggu Pak and the violinist Sarang West. At 7:30 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 625-8369, dnadance.org; $12 in advance, $17 day of performance; $14 for students and 65+. (Sulcas)
Fall for Dance (Friday and Saturday) There are two programs remaining in this far-reaching, pocketbook-friendly festival, where you can see flamenco from Spain, circus arts from Australia, hip-hop from South Korea and contemporary dance from the United States in a single evening. Such is the fifth and final lineup, featuring María Pagés, Circa, Laboratory Dance Project and Shen Wei. At 8 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; sold out. (Siobhan Burke)
Trajal Harrell (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Harrell has long been fascinated by the overlap (or lack thereof) between two cultural movements of 1960s New York: the postmodern experiments of Judson Dance Theater and, at the opposite end of Manhattan, the drag balls of Harlem. He continues his ''Twenty Looks'' series, which explores the connections, both real and hypothetical, between those worlds, with ''Judson Church Is Ringing in Harlem (Made-to-Measure),'' specially tailored to Danspace Project on the occasion of Judson's 50th anniversary. At 8 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, danspaceproject.org; $18. (Burke)
Raimund Hoghe (Friday) The classical pas de deux gets reimagined in ''Pas de Deux,'' a duet for this German choreographer and the Japanese dancer Takashi Ueno. Stark minimalism replaces displays of technical prowess, highlighting virtuosity of a different kind, as the two performers move together but in isolation. At 7:30 p.m., Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (866) 811-4111, bacnyc.org; $20. (Burke)
LifeDance / Gloria McLean (Sunday) As part of a program of new works, Gloria McLean presents a quartet, ''Dancing Without Illusion,'' inspired by the 101-year-old painter Will Barnet's 1950 essay of the same name as well as his paintings. Also on the program are ''The Space of a Line, Remembered,'' and ''Bashulli Poco,'' a solo. At 3 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, Upper East Side, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $15. (Sulcas)
&#x2605; New York City Ballet (Friday through Sunday) There is at least one good reason to go to every performance of City Ballet's final fall season weekend. On Friday there is Balanchine's magisterial ''Stravinsky Violin Concerto.'' On Saturday afternoon there are Sterling Hyltin making her debut in Jerome Robbins's spooky ''The Cage,'' and another Balanchine masterpiece, ''Symphony in C.'' On Saturday night there is Justin Peck's new and acclaimed ''Year of the Rabbit.'' And on Sunday there is a glorious all-Balanchine blowout: ''Apollo,'' Agon'' and ''Rubies.'' Your call. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 496-0600, nycballet.com; $29 to $155. (Sulcas)
Rebecca Patek (Friday) What better setting for Ms. Patek's ''You and I of the Storm,'' a commentary on art-world clichés and other sources of disenchantment, than an art museum? A young choreographer who's been noticed lately for her frank, unsettling and carefully calculated work, Ms. Patek presents this hybrid of comedy and contemporary dance as part of the Museum of Arts and Design's Risk x Reward performance series. At 8 p.m., Museum of Arts and Design, 2 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, (800) 838-3006, madmuseum.org; $15, or $10 for students. (Burke)
People Get Ready / Steven Reker (Thursday; through Oct. 20) Steven Reker has performed as both a dancer and a musician, and with his band, People Get Ready, he now creates performances that are a hybrid of music, dance, pop concert and mixtape. His new ''Specific Ocean'' uses songs from a recent album, and if you go early on Thursday you can listen to a discussion about ''Where Contemporary Dance & Pop Music Intersect in NYC Today.'' And if you stay late next Friday, there's a dance party, with a D.J. and special guests. At 7:30 p.m., New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, newyorklivearts.org; $15 to $20, or $16 for students and 65+. (Sulcas)
&#x2605; Hofesh Shechter (Friday and Saturday) New York finally gets a look at Mr. Shecther's first full-length work, ''Political Mother,'' which has been touring internationally since its acclaimed 2010 premiere in London, where the Israeli-born choreographer is based. Live drummers and guitarists provide the heavy-metal score (written by Shechter, formerly a drummer in a rock band), fueling a dark, explosive and fiercely contemporary evocation of repression and defiance. At 7:30 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $16 to $50. (Burke)
&#x2605; Tanztheater Wuppertal (Thursday; through Oct. 27) What is there to say about Pina Bausch's final, beautiful work, ''Como el musguito en la piedra, ay si, si, si ...'' except, go and see it? (The unwieldy title, which means ''like moss on a stone, ah yes, yes, yes,'' is taken from a song by the Chilean singer Violeta Parra.) Full of beautiful, winding solos, it celebrates the exceptional dancing of some of the younger members of the Wuppertal ensemble, as well as the gifts of some of its older dancers, like the 62-year-old Dominique Mercy. But then Bausch's work has never ignored the full spectrum of humanity, even -- or particularly -- its less agreeable aspects. ''Como el musguito,'' which was inspired by a residency in Chile, is, like much of her later work, markedly cheerful, even optimistic. In the light of her sudden death less than three weeks after its premiere, it seems all the more moving for that. At 7:30 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $25 to $125. (Sulcas)
Doug Varone and Dancers (Friday through Sunday) Mr. Varone's 25th-anniversary season at the Joyce continues. Highlights include the world premiere of ''Able to Leap Tall Buildings,'' a duet inspired by superhero action figures, and, on what will most likely be a more elegiac note, the New York premiere of ''Carrugi,'' inspired by Mozart's oratorio ''La Betulia Liberata'' and the labyrinthine landscape of Italy's Liguria region. The company also revives four older works: ''Boats Leaving,'' ''Ballet Mécanique,'' ''Aperture'' and ''Rise.'' Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $49. (Burke)

HEADLINE: Claims for Jobless Benefits Decline to a Four-Year Low

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits slid last week to the lowest level in more than four and a half years, the Labor Department reported on Thursday. 
The report provided the latest sign of an improvement in the job market, though the surprisingly large 30,000 drop in new claims may have reflected distortions because of seasonal adjustments that are likely to be smoothed out in coming weeks.
''The overall trend seems to be that the labor market is improving,'' said Brian Kim, a currency strategist at RBS Securities.
A Labor Department analyst said seasonal factors had predicted a very large increase in claims last week, which he said would be typical for the first week of the quarter. Unadjusted claims rose, but far less than expected, resulting in the sharp drop in the seasonally adjusted figure. He noted that one state, which he did not identify, reported an unexpected decline in claims last week.
''We will likely see some payback in the claims data reported next week,'' said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan. ''But through this potential volatility, it does look like the trend in the claims is improving somewhat.''
California, given its large population and past ''massive swings'' in its claims data, was probably the state that caused the sharp drop in the seasonally adjusted figure, Mr. Silver said.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 339,000, the lowest number of new claims since February 2008. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims edging up to 370,0000 last week.
The four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of labor market trends, fell 11,500, to 364,000, the lowest in six months.
The government reported last Friday that the unemployment rate dropped sharply in September to 7.8 percent, the lowest level since Mr. Obama took office, even though employers added a modest 114,000 jobs.
The report on jobless claims released on Thursday showed the number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid fell to 3.27 million in the week ended Sept. 29, the latest data available. It was the lowest since May.
The jobs data was tempered by a second report on Thursday that hinted at weaker American and global demand. The trade deficit widened in August to $44.2 billion, as exports of American goods fell for the fifth consecutive month and imports declined fractionally.
The Commerce Department said the monthly trade deficit increased to $44.2 billion in August, from an upwardly revised estimate of $42.5 billion in July. Analysts were expecting an August trade deficit of about $44 billion.
Over all, American exports dropped 1.0 percent as troubles in Europe continued to weigh on global growth, while imports fell 0.1 percent in a sign of faltering American demand for consumer products, autos and capital goods.

HEADLINE: Safeguards Against Speculative Banking

 BODY:
Bank bailouts were supposed to be followed by financial reform to limit the banks' destructive power. Instead, bailed-out banks are bigger than ever and have resisted reforms to limit their size and complexity. The lack of progress, however, may yet give way to change. 
A new report by a European Commission-appointed committee of experts, led by Erkki Liikanen, the governor of Finland's central bank, makes a strong case for having large banks segregate traditional banking activities from risky trading operations. Such reform would help to ensure that everyday functions, like taking deposits and lending to businesses, could not be derailed by losses on speculative trades in securities and derivatives.
Equally important, it would reduce such trading because banks would no longer be able to use government-insured customer deposits to support their trades. Less trading would reduce systemwide risk, because it is the trading relationships among banks that can cause one bank's losses to cascade throughout the system.
The Liikanen recommendations also offer hope that regulators will eventually be able to agree on banking reforms that apply internationally. If the European Union passes them into law, they will apply throughout the 27-nation bloc. Moreover, the recommendations echo policies, championed by the British economist John Vickers, that are being adopted in Britain. And they reflect the spirit of the Volcker Rule in the United States, which would prohibit federally insured banks from speculating in securities and derivatives.
Those efforts still fall short of a global consensus on how to make banks safer, but they do indicate a trend, supported by top banking experts around the world. That is not to imply, however, that anti-speculation reforms are a done deal. The Liikanen recommendations face an arduous legislative process, including technical and legal challenges to make them consistent with other emerging Pan-European bank reforms. The Vickers reforms have been watered down as they have been put in place. The Volcker Rule has yet to be finalized.
Nor does this trend imply that the reforms go far enough. The plans need to be paired with strong regulation of the derivatives market to ensure transparency and fair dealing in the trading that does occur.
The euro crisis has demonstrated the continued instability of the global financial system. Other revelations -- from JPMorgan Chase's ''London Whale'' losses, to manipulation of the Libor benchmark interest rate by some banks, to vast money laundering schemes -- show recklessness and untrustworthiness in the industry, and the need for stronger regulation than many policy makers were willing to consider in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis. The banks will surely resist the reform proposals. But policy makers should respond by making them tougher, not weaker.

HEADLINE: In Trade Cases, Solar Panel Industry Follows Lead of Steel Industry

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The solar panel manufacturing industry in the United States and Europe has begun a volley of trade cases against imports, following the same track as the steel industry before it -- and for many of the same reasons.
''Back in the '60s and '70s, all over the world, governments were investing in steel mills,'' said Nicholas Tolerico, a retired American trade official and steel executive. ''These days, they invest in solar panels, and you end up with the same overcapacity and cutthroat pricing.''
The Commerce Department issued a final ruling Wednesday that would impose tariffs of 24 to 36 percent on solar panels imported from China. The department concluded, despite China's denials, that manufacturers had received government subsidies and had ''dumped'' solar panels on the United States market for less than it cost to manufacture and ship them.
Solar panel manufacturers in the United States are now lobbying the Obama administration to broaden the tariffs to include solar panels made partly in China and partly in other places, notably Taiwan. And the American industry is not ruling out more trade cases against other Asian solar panel exporters. 
In Brussels, the European Union has started a trade investigation into solar panel imports from China, a case covering imports worth $26.5 billion last year. And the European industry is seeking a second case against Chinese solar panel exports, accusing them of benefiting from government subsidies.
Shen Danyang, a spokesman for China's commerce ministry, said in a statement on Thursday that the United States had disregarded ''the reasonable defense of the Chinese government and Chinese enterprises,'' and he expressed ''strong dissatisfaction'' with the Commerce Department's decision.
He also said that the American decision to put import tariffs on a category of renewable energy imports was harmful to global efforts to address climate change. And he warned that the American action was likely to result in reduced Chinese imports of raw materials and factory equipment for the solar panel industry.
He Weiwen, a co-director of the China-U.S.-E.U. Study Center at the China Association of International Trade, which is part of the Commerce Ministry, said his opinion was that China was likely to call for consultations with the United States to reach a settlement on the tariffs.
Such settlements have been reached in trade disputes in the past, leading to outcomes like price floors for tomatoes imported from Mexico and the so-called voluntary restraints that Japan imposed on its car exports in the 1980s, which were anything but voluntary.
But Mr. He said it was unlikely that negotiations could start quickly, given the coming presidential election in the United States, and he worried that settling a trade dispute with China might not be at the top of the agenda of whoever is sworn in as president.
''The new administration will be faced with more pressing domestic issues,'' he said.
The tariffs imposed Wednesday cover about $3 billion a year in imported solar panels and were imposed after a quasi-judicial process at the Commerce Department. United States law does not allow the White House to intervene in the process of calculating duties. But the duties can be replaced with a negotiated settlement that also satisfies the domestic industry.
To the dismay of Chinese regulators, hundreds of solar panel manufacturers in their country have followed a pattern of using lavish loans from state-owned banks to buy and install as much foreign-made factory equipment as possible while setting aside little for research and development.
''They made quite a lot of money but did not invest,'' Li Junfeng, a director general for energy and climate policy at the National Development and Reform Commission, said in an interview last month in Beijing. The commission is China's top economic planning agency.
Mr. Li, who is also the president of the Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association, also said that the solar industry's problems were the direct result of overcapacity in China and not the fault of overseas trade restrictions.
Yet he insisted that if the Chinese government could revisit past renewable energy decisions, it would not do anything differently because the business community in China is prone to overinvestment in many industries.
Asked what he was telling Chinese banks to do about their continued loans to solar panel manufacturers, he replied, ''I say, 'Just stop.' ''
But Frank Haugwitz, a solar industry consultant in Beijing, said this week that there were signs that Chinese banks would sharply increase lending, at least to the country's largest solar panel manufacturers, a step that could allow them to delay taking losses on previous loans to those companies.
Aaron Chew, a renewable energy analyst at the Maxim Group, a New York investment bank and asset management company, estimated that the 10 largest Chinese solar manufacturers had already borrowed $18 billion almost entirely from state-controlled banks.
Dirk Thomas, an executive in the computer hard drive industry who is now a solar industry consultant in Hong Kong, predicted that China could emerge triumphant from the current troubles in the solar panel industry.
Those Chinese solar panel companies chosen by the government to receive more bank loans could end up buying enough of their domestic and foreign competitors to gain market dominance, reduce overcapacity and set prices high enough to be profitable, he said.
That would follow a pattern already seen in the computer hard drive industry since the 1980s -- although in that industry, the consolidation has been led by a Japanese company, Toshiba, and two American companies, Seagate and Western Digital.
When China began the rapid expansion of its solar industry several years ago, many in the global industry expected that technological breakthroughs would result in more cost reductions. But Chinese companies have driven costs down sharply, mainly through greater economies of scale from the construction of larger factories to produce conventional solar panels, and few industry executives foresee further cost reductions by building even larger factories.
At the same time, few new technologies have been developed. Some experts attribute that to China's rapid expansion of capacity for conventional polycrystalline solar panels, which has driven prices down so quickly that investment in newer thin-film solar technologies has faltered, particularly in Europe.
''The artificially low prices resulting from Chinese overproduction have nearly destroyed a second generation of photovoltaic technologies based on thin film,'' said Ken Zweibel, the director of the George Washington University Solar Institute in Washington. ''This has been a huge setback for the U.S. competitive position.''
But Sebastian Meyer, a partner at Azure International, a renewable energy consulting firm in Beijing, said he thought the United States decision on tariffs was a mistake.
The United States is still strong in making factory equipment for manufacturing solar panels, Mr. Meyer said, and should let China actually make the panels as long as Chinese banks and local and provincial governments refuse to admit defeat and continue covering most of the costs.
''If you buy a solar panel from China, China is paying for part of it,'' he said. ''If I were the U.S., I would let Americans milk it.''

HEADLINE: Markets End Flat After an Early Rally Fades

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks were flat Thursday, unimpressed by encouraging jobs news but unrattled by worrisome developments in the global economy.
In the morning, a government report of fewer jobless claims carried the market higher. The Dow Jones industrial average rose as much as 83 points, shrugging off a widening trade deficit in the United States, higher unemployment in Greece and a ratings cut for Spain. 
By late afternoon, the rally sputtered. The Dow closed down 18.58 points, or 0.14 percent, to 13,326.39.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index inched up 0.28 point, or 0.02 percent, to 1,432.84.
The Nasdaq composite index declined 2.37 points, or 0.08 percent, to 3,049.41.
Traders, it seemed, were so used to bad news that Thursday's developments did not really push them one way or the other.
''There's not a lot to move the market today,'' said Erik Davidson, deputy chief investment officer of Wells Fargo Private Bank in San Francisco. ''Everyone's talking about baseball,'' he said, referring to the postseason playoffs.
The Labor Department said that weekly applications for unemployment aid fell to their lowest level since February 2008, before the financial crisis, and when the unemployment rate was much lower -- 4.9 percent, compared with today's 7.8 percent.
Citigroup analysts upgraded United States stocks to the equivalent of buy. The analysts, led by Hasan Tevfik and Robert Buckland, argued that stocks were relatively cheap and that central banks seem likely to take more steps to try to stimulate the economy.
Still, their report was not all cheery, and neither were most of the other economic developments Thursday.
''Profits are slowing around the world,'' the Citi analysts wrote, and earnings-per-share expectations ''need to be cut further, in our view.''
Already this week, the aluminum manufacturer Alcoa initiated the third-quarter earnings season with a disappointing loss. Thursday, shares of the grocery store Safeway slipped 3.56 percent, or 58 cents, to $15.71, after it reported a lower profit margin.
The Commerce Department reported that foreign demand declined for American-made cars and farm goods.
In Germany, economic researchers predicted the country's growth would slow, and warned that patience for bailing out weaker European countries was evaporating.
Unemployment in Greece, one of the countries receiving a bailout, hit a record high of just more than 25 percent.
And the Standard & Poor's ratings agency late Wednesday cut its rating on Spain's debt to one level above junk status.
A few stocks jumped after reports of possible acquisitions. Sprint Nextel soared 14.29 percent, or 72 cents, to $5.76, after a report that the company was in talks with Softbank, a Japanese cellphone provider.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 4/32, to 99 20/32, and the yield fell to 1.67 percent from 1.68 percent late Wednesday after a new auction of bills.

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.
&#x2605; 'Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry' (R, 1:31, in English and Mandarin) In December 2008 a 24-year-old American, Alison Klayman, as a favor to a friend, started videotaping the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Her timing was dazzling as was her perseverance, as becomes clear in this galvanizing portrait of the artist, his work and his times. (Manohla Dargis)
'Arbitrage' (R, 1:40) Richard Gere plays a New York hedge-fund magnate whose glittering world may be coming undone in Nicholas Jarecki's sleek entertainment about how very good greed can be. A fairy tale masquerading as a tragedy, the film features Susan Sarandon as the wife and Brit Marling as the doting daughter. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Dark Knight Rises' (PG-13, 2:44) After seven years and two films that have pushed Batman (Christian Bale) ever deeper into the dark, the director Christopher Nolan has completed his postmodern, post-Sept. 11 epic of ambivalent good versus multidimensional evil with a burst of light. (Dargis) 
'Detropia' (No rating, 1:33) A visual caress of postindustrial blight, Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady's dreamy documentary about a slowly crumbling Detroit places information and analysis distant seconds to mood and impression. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
'Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel' (PG-13, 1:26) A dizzily enjoyable documentary from Lisa Immordino Vreeland about Diana Vreeland, the famous fashion editor and paradigmatic self-made woman who had a genius for the inspirational, the gnomic and the quotable. (Dargis)
'Dredd 3D' (R, 1:35) Alex Garland wrote and Pete Travis directed this grim, gory adaptation of the British comic series. The setting is a neo-wild West in which the gizmos look futuristic, but everything else is B-movie familiar. Karl Urban stars. (Dargis)
'End of Watch' (R, 1:49) David Ayer's ode to beat cops and the expansive literature on them is a muscular, maddening exploitation movie embellished with art-house style and anchored by solid performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña. (Dargis)
'Frankenweenie' (PG, 1:27) This cute and creepy animated update of the Frankenstein story, from the imagination of Tim Burton, pays tribute to monster movies of the past while honoring the commercial family-movie imperatives of the present. (A. O. Scott)
'Harvest of Empire' (No rating, 1:30, in English and Spanish) This fact-filled documentary works as a civics lesson and has a punch that comes from political advocacy. Directed by Peter Getzels and Eduardo López, it has two clear missions: to combat anti-immigrant feeling and to show how migration from Latin America has been spurred by the sometimes violent intervention of the United States. (Rachel Saltz)
'Hotel Transylvania' (PG, 1:31) This animated film, essentially ''The Little Mermaid'' with monsters, looks great, though the story grows less interesting as the movie progresses. Dracula keeps his teenage (well, she's 118) daughter in a hotel that's exclusively for monsters to protect her from those nasty humans, but she wants to experience the world. A wayward hiker dude only reinforces that determination. Some good monster-related humor early on before the predictable plot takes over. (Neil Genzlinger)
'The House I Live In' (No rating, 1:48) In his latest documentary, Eugene Jarecki, inspired by an African-American family employee, digs deep into the drug war and its racial and class implications. The result is a call to national conscience, and persuasively urgent. (Dargis)
'House at the End of the Street' (PG-13, 1:41) Jennifer Lawrence and Elisabeth Shue star in this blatant unscary ''Psycho'' rip-off, an incoherent hybrid of the Hitchcock classic and standard teenage horror films. (Stephen Holden)
&#x2605; 'How to Survive a Plague' (No rating, 1:50) The currents of rage, fear, fiery determination and, finally, triumph that crackle through David France's inspiring documentary lend this history of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or Act Up, a scorching electrical charge. (Holden)
'The Intouchables' (R, 1:52, in French) In this buddy movie from France, a rich white guy (François Cluzet), paralyzed from the neck down, is cared for by an African immigrant (Omar Sy) who teaches his boss to loosen up and appreciate life. The film's unabashed embrace of racial stereotypes may startle American audiences -- the movie was a huge hit in France -- but there is appealing warmth to the performances and an overall mood of friendly tolerance. It's embarrassing, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)
'Looper' (R, 1:58) Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a killer and Bruce Willis plays an older version of the same in Rian Johnson's obstreperously entertaining science-fiction pastiche set in a futuristic world that sometimes looks and sounds paradoxically out of the past. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Master' (R, 2:17) Confounding and amazing, Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film explores the relationship between a cult leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a shellshocked veteran of World War II (Joaquin Phoenix). Must be seen to be believed, and wrestled with for a long time after. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Moonrise Kingdom' (PG-13, 1:34) In Wes Anderson's latest, a wondrous storybook tale, a girl and a boy, both 12, run off to a remote inlet on an island where most of the adults seem disappointed and more than a little sad. The two are very serious -- about love, their plans, books, life itself -- and often act older than their age. You wonder what their hurry is, given that here adulthood, with its quarrels, regrets and anguished pillow talk, can feel as dangerous as the storm that's hurtling toward the island, ready to blow it all down. With Bill Murray, Bruce Willis and Frances McDormand. (Dargis)
'The Oranges' (R, 1:30) The best explanation for this dud that wastes the talents of Hugh Laurie, Oliver Platt, Allison Janney and Catherine Keener may be that its creators couldn't decide whether it should be a dangerous comic satire or a serious dramatic downer, and settled for a wishy-washy middle ground. (Holden)
'The Paperboy' (R, 1:46) In the hands of Lee Daniels (''Precious''), Pete Dexter's Southern potboiler becomes a hot mess of pulpy passion, utterly incoherent but crazily alive. With Nicole Kidman, Matthew McConaughey and Zac Efron in his underpants. (Scott)
'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' (PG-13, 1:43) Stephen Chbosky directs this adaptation of his 1999 young adult novel about the ups, downs and playlists of an introverted high school freshman, Charlie (Logan Lerman), who's rescued by the friendships he makes. (Dargis)
'Pitch Perfect' (PG-13, 1:52) This comedy about a female collegiate a cappella group feels as if it's aimed at tweeners, which is too bad because that saddles it with dopey plot elements -- daddy issues, boyfriend issues -- that prevent a more substantive look at this rich genre of music. A few of the songs, though, rock. (Genzlinger)
'The Possession' (PG-13, 1:32) Perched somewhere between ''The Exorcist'' and ''The Unborn,'' this eerily enjoyable tale from the Danish director Ole Bornedal gives a malevolent box to a troubled young girl, throws in the Hasidic rap artist Matisyahu, and stands back. (Catsoulis)
'Resident Evil: Retribution' (R, 1:35) Taking place almost entirely inside airless, computer-simulated locations, this fifth entry in the series finds its caffeinated heroine (Milla Jovovich) still battling zombies, still wearing bondage gear, only now with a daughter -- shamelessly cribbing from ''Aliens'' -- and an alternate suburban reality to protect. (Catsoulis)
'Samsara' (PG-13, 1:39) Ron Fricke's new film, like its predecessor, ''Baraka,'' is a free-associative tour of the world, a series of striking, sometimes surreal images of nature, work, life and death in the global economy. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Searching for Sugar Man' (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul's hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez, who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don't wait for the DVD. (Dargis)
'Sleepwalk With Me' (No rating, 1:30) The surreal dream sequences in this screen adaptation of Mike Birbiglia's 2008 one-man show -- about a commitment-phobic stand-up comedian with a sleep disorder -- help make this likable movie more than a glorified stand-up act. (Holden)
'Ted' (R, 1:46) Seth MacFarlane, creator of ''The Family Guy,'' takes his provocative humor and his New England-accented voice-over skills to the big screen in this profane, sometimes funny comedy about a talking stuffed animal, the overgrown boy who loves him (Mark Wahlberg) and, somewhat tangentially, the boy's girlfriend (Mila Kunis) who wishes he would just grow up. (Scott)
'Trouble With the Curve' (PG-13, 1:51) The latest of Clint Eastwood's grumpy old men is Gus Lobel, a Major League Baseball scout struggling with failing eyesight and a front office full of number-crunching ''Moneyball'' types. On a trip to North Carolina to check out a promising young slugger, Gus and his semi-estranged daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), do some squabbling and some healing. Mickey, a big-city lawyer, also dabbles in romance with a rival (and former protégé) of her dad's played by Justin Timberlake. The movie, directed by Mr. Eastwood's protégé Robert Lorenz, is hokey and predictable -- the very title is a spoiler -- but it is also full of warmth, humor and wonderful performances. (Scott)
'V/H/S' (R, 1:55) Populated by drunks, louts and Grade-A molesters, this low-budget horror anthology flits from ghastly to moronic in displays of braying masculinity that can be, at least for women, a chore to listen to and a torment to watch. (Catsoulis)
'Won't Back Down' (PG, 2:00) Two moms, Viola Davis and Maggie Gyllenhaal, team up to fight a teachers' union in the name of ''the kids.'' This exercise in educational-reform propaganda, directed by Daniel Barnz, is somewhat amusing in the way it turns the traditional strike drama on its head, but it is so strident and tone-deaf that even those who sympathize with its anti-labor views -- to say nothing of the union members who make up the cast -- may find themselves embarrassed. (Scott)
'Wuthering Heights' (No rating, 2:08) Andrea Arnold strips away the veneer of polish and romanticism to produce a wild and raw version of Emily Brontë's novel of ill-starred passion. The film, the first with black actors playing Heathcliff, aims for maximum intensity, but its naturalism feels as mannered in its way as the stately decorum of older adaptations. (Scott)
Film Series
'Creature From the Black Lagoon' (Friday through Thursday) The Gill Man is back, carrying off the ravishing Julie Adams in his scaly arms in a newly remastered digital 3-D edition that promises to put the appalling red-green reissues of recent years to shame.

50 Years of James Bond (Friday through Thursday) As the world awaits the release of the latest James Bond adventure, ''Skyfall,'' on Nov. 9, the Museum of Modern Art unreels its collection of all 22 of the canonical Bond films, donated by the company behind the franchise, Eon Productions. In the rotation this Friday are the final two films starring the longest-running Bond, Roger Moore -- ''Octopussy'' (1983) and ''A View to a Kill'' (1985) -- followed on Saturday by Timothy Dalton's ascension to the role in ''The Living Daylights'' (1987) and ''Licence to Kill'' (1989). The balance of the week moves through Pierce Brosnan, from ''GoldenEye'' (1995) to ''Die Another Day'' (2002), and enters the Daniel Craig era with ''Casino Royale'' (2006) and ''Quantum of Solace'' (2008), before resetting with Sean Connery in ''Dr. No'' (1962) on Thursday. The series continues through Oct. 31. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $12. (Kehr)
&#x2605; 'The Loves of Pharaoh' (Thursday through Oct. 20) The Brooklyn Academy of Music inaugurates its Steinberg Screen -- a 35-by-19-foot surface newly installed at the Harvey Theater for presentations that require a large format -- with a superb new restoration of Ernst Lubitsch's last German film. Made in 1922, at a time when the inflationary economy of the Weimar Republic made it possible to make films on a gigantic scale, with hordes of extras recruited from the unemployed, it's a movie that was designed with the international export market in mind, and was partly financed with money from Paramount Pictures, the film's original American distributor. Emil Jannings, the face of the Weimar cinema to the world (''The Blue Angel''), stars as the fictional King Amenes, who falls for a beautiful slave girl (Dagny Servaes), only to find himself spurned in favor of a handsome young man (Harry Liedtke) -- occasioning many bouts of the masochistic suffering that was Jannings's trademark. The film's re-creation of ancient Egypt on a lot near Berlin clearly left an impression on Cecil B. DeMille, at the time Paramount's leading director but still a specialist in comedies and melodramas about contemporary sexual mores. After ''Pharaoh,'' DeMille folded his style into Lubitsch's for his first version of ''The Ten Commandments,'' while Lubitsch, in one of film history's tidier paradoxes, turned away from costume pictures to DeMille-style sex comedies on his arrival in Hollywood.

HEADLINE: New Orleans Shields An Area From Tours

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
The lumbering buses that carry camera-wielding tourists through New Orleans still stop at Bourbon Street's bars, Jackson Square's cathedral and the Garden District's mansions.
But one destination is now largely off limits: the Lower Ninth Ward, where Hurricane Katrina inflicted its worst havoc and the recovery has been slowest.
New Orleans officials are cracking down on hurricane-themed tours, saying buses damage newly paved streets and cross the line into disaster voyeurism. After years of loosely enforcing a ban on motor coaches in the Lower Ninth, the police are turning back tours and fined one company $150. 
It has been a balancing act for a city that depends on nine million tourists a year, many curious to see the recovery firsthand. But seven years later, patience is wearing thin. In August, the Taxicab Bureau notified bus companies that they risked losing their licenses if they crossed the Industrial Canal into the neighborhood.
A city councilman, Ernest F. Charbonnet, who represents the Lower Ninth, plans to introduce legislation later this year that would cap buses at 30 passengers and restrict them to the neighborhood's main streets. He has asked tour companies to agree on a single route and wants to charge each bus to raise money for replanting grass and repairing broken street lamps.
''Residents don't like being gawked at by tourists as though they're sideshow attractions,'' said Mr. Charbonnet, who is holding a town hall-style meeting for Lower Ninth residents on Friday to discuss the buses.
Thirty-four licensed bus companies operate in New Orleans, many with tours focused on the hurricane. With names like ''Hurricane Katrina -- America's Greatest Catastrophe,'' they charge about $45 for firsthand glimpses of vine-covered houses and abandoned properties. ''We'll drive past an actual levee that 'breached' and see the resulting devastation that displaced hundreds of thousands of U.S. residents,'' Gray Line, one of the largest tour companies, promises on its Web site.
About 5,560 people live in the Lower Ninth, only about a quarter of the population in 2000. The largely abandoned neighborhood, east of downtown, suffered some of the worst damage during the hurricane and still has no police station, supermarket or hospital.
Residents say they have seen little economic benefit from the tours. Buses do not let visitors off in the neighborhood, but occasionally vendors come aboard to sell pralines. ''It's the bus companies that are reaping the benefits,'' said the Rev. Charles Duplessis, who said tours passed his house every hour, from dawn until dusk, seven days a week.
Tour companies say they are simply giving visitors what they want. Without the buses, visitors would take self-guided trips in taxis and rental cars, creating more traffic, they say. And many donate to Habitat for Humanity or Brad Pitt's Make It Right foundation after seeing the houses those nonprofit organizations have built.
''This is our most-demanded area,'' said Jeff Rogers, owner of Cajun Encounters Tour Company, which offered four daily tours of the hurricane damage until August. ''People want to know: What was destroyed, what was rebuilt, where is our tax money going?''
David Lee Ducote, owner of Southern Style Tours, said the ban threatens his company. In August, he received a $150 ticket. Now he avoids the neighborhood, instead taking visitors to Musician's Village, where artists and musicians rebuilt after the storm.
But not every bus company has stopped its tours. A spokeswoman for Gray Line said its Lower Ninth tours will continue, but it is working with the city to find a suitable route. The company said it has not been issued any tickets. Ryan F. Berni, a spokesman for the mayor, said the city wants a compromise to ''benefit both commerce and the community.''
New Orleans limits the size of tour buses allowed in other neighborhoods, including the Garden District and in the French Quarter. But Valeria Schexnayder, 65, who has lived in the Lower Ninth since 1964, would rather see no buses at all. They rattle shotgun-style houses so badly that paint chips and paintings fall off walls, she said. Worse are the cameras.
''I felt like an animal in a zoo,'' she said. ''Videos of me are all over YouTube.''
Tours by bicycle, car and van are still allowed in the Lower Ninth. But many of New Orleans's 555 licensed tour guides say they, too, are ready to shift visitors' focus away from Hurricane Katrina. Tom Nagelin, president of the Tour Guides Association of Greater New Orleans, said he avoids the Lower Ninth. ''We're tired of hearing about Katrina. We want to move on as a city,'' he said. ''My tours focus on cuisine, art and architecture -- not hurricanes.''

HEADLINE: Readying a Rail Bridge Over the Rio Grande

BYLINE: By JULIÁN AGUILAR. 
jaguilar@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Residents along the Texas-Mexico border last witnessed a ribbon-cutting for a railway bridge well before World War I, and before Mexico had fought its own revolution.
That is set to change in December, when officials from both sides of the Rio Grande expect the completion of the Brownsville West Rail Bypass International Bridge, an eight-mile project that traverses a rural part of Cameron County in Texas and runs into Tamaulipas State in Mexico. The bridge, which has taken more than 10 years to plan and build, will be the first across the border since the 1900s.
Business experts and local officials say the project should make the growing trade between Texas and Mexico easier and allow the Laredo Customs District to remain the country's No. 1 inland port. 
The bridge was designed, in part, to help alleviate the congestion caused by the current rail line between cities on both sides of the border.
''One of the problems that we have with the existing rail bridge is that we do not have a window with sufficient time to cross into Mexico,'' said Pete Sepulveda, the Cameron County administrator, referring to the time when rail traffic does not intrude on vehicular and pedestrian traffic in urban areas.
''When we take it from an urban area to a rural area, that gives us the ability to extend that window,'' Mr. Sepulveda said. ''From an administrative standpoint, that gives us a good marketing tool.''
Rail traffic hauls about 6 percent of the goods that pass across the United States' southern border under the North American Free Trade Agreement, said Nelson Balido, the president of the Border Trade Alliance, a nonprofit consortium of economists and private sector interests that represents more than 4.2 million members.
The Mexican government ''predicts that in the next five years, it will increase to 35 percent,'' Mr. Balido said.
Despite a global economic downturn and a level of violence in Mexico that has not been seen since its revolution in the early 20th century, trade between the United States and Mexico has increased steadily over the last few years.
During the first seven months of this year, commerce between the two countries totaled about $287 billion, according to United States census data analyzed by WorldCity, which tracks global trade patterns. That represents an increase of almost 10 percent over the same period in 2011. About $133 billion of that has passed through the Laredo Customs District, which includes the Port of Brownsville. The county has spent about $3.5 million on the project. The remaining $34 million was picked up by the state and federal governments, Mr. Sepulveda said. The Brownsville bridge project began in 2000 and moved slowly, in part because it had to come out of its general revenue.
International vehicular and pedestrian bridges, which often charge tolls and are managed by city officials, are significant sources of money for local governments. The revenue is partly spent on infrastructure projects or improvements. Rail lines are privately owned, however, and Union Pacific will own and manage the new line.
Mr. Sepulveda said the county would benefit from the economic development attached to the project, including a revamp of the area around the existing line.
''There is going to be about an eight-mile stretch inside the city of Brownsville that we're going to be able to redevelop,'' he said.
He added that the violence in Mexico had not been a deterrent.
''We knew we were planning for the future. We were aware,'' he said. ''We're cognizant of the issues going on in Mexico, but we feel that given time, those issues will be resolved.''
''And when they do,'' he added, ''we want to be in a position to maximize the benefits.''

HEADLINE: Drawing Back a Curtain On a Mexican Tycoon

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED; Charles V. Bagli contributed reporting.

 BODY:
High above Columbus Circle, atop the Time Warner Center, is one of the most expensive apartments in Manhattan, a sleek aerie of steel and stone, high windows and soaring views.
It is the home of David Martinez, a Mexican financier who has minted a fortune buying and selling the debt of troubled countries and companies from Argentina to Pakistan. He paid about $42 million for the 12,000-square-foot duplex in 2003, then spent even more on additions and renovations, covering the space in stone and stainless steel.
The apartment has a private art collection that is said to include a $140 million Jackson Pollock. But for all his extravagant spending, Mr. Martinez is, even to his associates, something of a mystery.
Now a legal battle with another powerful investor is drawing back a curtain on Mr. Martinez's secretive world. While investors often have disputes that end up in court, this cross-border fight is with one of the giants in global distressed debt - Paul E. Singer, a major Republican donor. The dispute, and its eventual victor, could have implications for other companies in the world's fastest-growing economies. 
The fight is over the bankruptcy of Mexico's largest glassmaker, Vitro, a 103-year-old company run by the Sada family, one of the wealthiest in Monterrey. Allegations abound of covert meetings, fraudulent debts and crooked courts in a bankruptcy that ended up leaving control of the company in the hands of its shareholders, while costing bondholders as much as 60 percent of their investment, according to some estimates.
That runs counter to what typically happens in an American bankruptcy, and Mr. Singer and other Vitro creditors have argued that if Vitro and Mr. Martinez prevail, other Mexican companies could have trouble raising money in the United States.
Both men are known as "vulture investors," a term applied to those who buy up cheap debt that no one wants. The strategy has made Mr. Singer's company, Elliott Management, one of the most successful hedge funds in the world. Mr. Singer, 68, cut his teeth wrangling payments on defaulted debt from countries like Peru and Congo, and has earned a reputation for bare-knuckled doggedness unparalleled on Wall Street. Just last week, Elliott Management persuaded a court in Ghana to seize an Argentine naval ship in a dispute over the South American country's bonds.
Yet he may have met his match in Mr. Martinez. Over the last 20 years, the 55-year-old financier has plowed billions of dollars into troubled corners of the global economy, often aligning himself with the management of bankrupt companies.
"If you don't know who the sucker is in a particular deal, it's probably you," a top investor in distressed debt said. "When David is involved, you know he isn't the sucker."
He and others interviewed for this article declined to be identified speaking about Mr. Martinez, citing the continuing litigation or fear of angering him. Through a spokesman, Mr. Martinez declined to comment.
Little is known about the financier, who splits his time between New York and London, where he runs an obscure investment company called Fintech Advisory Ltd. In life as in business, Mr. Martinez treads lightly. He is fond of shell companies, whether to buy artwork or to pay household expenses. Those he hires often know him only as "the client."
But Mr. Martinez and Mr. Singer are not strangers. They have clashed before, most notably during Argentina's debt restructuring in 2005. While Elliott is still holding out for a more lucrative settlement with the nation over its defaulted bonds, Fintech sided with Argentina in 2005, a move that some bondholders felt undermined efforts to force the country to pay what it owed.
In the case of Vitro, Elliott and allied investors contend that Mr. Martinez helped the Mexican company muscle investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars through financial sleight of hand. Mr. Singer and his counterparts, who own about $700 million worth of the company's old debt, have called Vitro's efforts "a testament to audacity, brazen manipulation and greed."
Vitro says that it has done nothing illegal. The maneuvers, it says, are standard practice under Mexican law and have been used in many other bankruptcies there. Fintech noted that a United States bankruptcy court, which is handling the bankruptcy of Vitro's United States subsidiaries, found no wrongdoing this summer. "Such McCarthy-like allegations were unsupported," lawyers for Fintech wrote in court documents.
The conflict has its roots in 2009, when Vitro found itself mired in trouble after the financial crisis. Bad derivatives bets had dried up its cash, and it began defaulting on its debt. The company called on Mr. Martinez for help.
To get some much-needed cash, the company struck a deal with the investor: a $75 million loan in exchange for the title to several of its properties. As part of the arrangement, Mr. Martinez was given an option to return the properties to Vitro, once it emerged from bankruptcy, in exchange for a 24 percent stake in the company - effectively aligning his interests with management as it negotiated with other creditors.
In mid-2010, he went to the different banks that Vitro owed money to and bought the claims. In the process, Mr. Martinez became the biggest individual outside creditor, owning about $600 million worth of claims.
The company began taking big loans from its subsidiaries, in effect creating a fresh class of creditors outside of the hedge funds - a group under its control, with the rights to approve any bankruptcy plan. Subsidiaries went from owing the parent company about $1.2 billion to being owed $1.5 billion.
With the help of Mr. Martinez, the company outvoted many other bondholders to approve a reorganization plan.
That maneuver was upheld by a court in Monterrey, allowing Vitro to proceed with a plan that pays creditors an estimated 40 to 60 percent of what they are owed and keeps the Sada family in control.
Mr. Singer and the hedge funds have taken the fight to the United States, suing Vitro and Fintech. This summer, the hedge funds won a round, as a federal judge in Dallas declined to uphold the Mexican court's ruling. Arguments in the appeal were heard earlier this month.
The outcome of this case, experts say, could have implications for other companies in fast-growing economies. A country that appears to be undermining protections that are typically granted to creditors in a bankruptcy might scare investors away. "This is a precedent-setting case, no matter how it turns out," said Arturo Porzecanski, economist in residence at American University's School of International Service. "It has highlighted apparent loopholes in the bankruptcy law of Mexico, through which Vitro ran an 18-wheel truck."
In suing Fintech, the hedge funds encountered one obstacle early on: they couldn't find Mr. Martinez.
When servers went to Fintech's Park Avenue offices to deliver the summons, they could not reach him. They stood outside the Time Warner Center for weeks hoping to catch him, to no avail.
Eventually, the lawsuit found its way to the investment company in London.
Mr. Martinez was born in 1957 and grew up in Monterrey, which is home to some of Mexico's largest industrial companies. Power there is heavily concentrated among businessmen in the so-called Group of 10, a club that includes the Sada family, which controls Vitro.
Though Mr. Martinez was not a part of that circle, he has cultivated deep connections to it. The Sadas relied on Mr. Martinez to help them maintain control of another of their companies that went bankrupt in 2004.
As a young man, Mr. Martinez was a member of Regnum Christi, an evangelical group related to the Legionaries of Christ, an influential Roman Catholic order in Mexico that includes among its benefactors the billionaire Carlos Slim. After earning an engineering degree from the Tecnológico de Monterrey, Mr. Martinez moved to Rome to study philosophy at the Pontifical Gregorian University and considered becoming a priest.
But he was drawn to Wall Street instead, and earned a third degree from Harvard Business School before taking a job at Citigroup on the emerging-markets desk in New York. There, he began his long affair with distressed debt in far-flung places. In 1985, he left the bank and eventually founded Fintech.
While it is unclear how much money the company controls, or even how many employees work there, bits and pieces have emerged about Mr. Martinez over the years. Often it relates to his art collection, which includes the works of Damien Hirst and Mark Rothko.
In his lavish redoubt overlooking the city and Central Park from the penthouse of the Time Warner Center's South Tower, Mr. Martinez has fashioned a gallery for his art. The apartment has a two-story living room and a reflecting pool, according to public records and interviews with people familiar with the unit. A special system has been rigged to support one exceptionally heavy piece of art.
Even before the costly renovations by the architect Peter Marino, the home was among the city's most expensive residences.
But Mr. Martinez still had spending to do. In the fall of 2006, word spread that Jackson Pollock's "No. 5, 1948" had been sold for $140 million, a record at the time. The buyer was said to be Mr. Martinez - a rumor that lawyers for Mr. Martinez denied, sending the art world into a state of confusion as to the whereabouts of the painting.
Through a spokesman, Mr. Martinez still denies that he owns the work. But according to several people with knowledge of the collection, the painting currently hangs in his New York home.Charles V. Bagli contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Right Way for Turkey to Intervene in Syria

BYLINE: By SONER CAGAPTAY. 
Soner Cagaptay is a fellow and the director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

 BODY:
Washington
TURKEY was the first country to take direct military action against the government of Bashar al-Assad since Syria's uprising began in the spring of 2011. And tensions are escalating further: earlier this week, the Turkish government sent 25 F-16 fighters to an air base near the border with Syria and on Wednesday it forced a Syrian passenger plane to land in the Turkish capital, Ankara, where suspected military aid shipments were taken off the plane.
The shelling along the Turkish-Syrian border is a critical development. The Assad regime is already busy fighting the Free Syrian Army near the Turkish border, where it has been bombing towns and villages. Precision artillery targeting is difficult, and the Syrian military is not known for its accuracy. What's more, many rebel-held areas lie right next to the Turkish border. Hence even if the Syrians try not to shell Turkish territory, they are quite likely to cause inadvertent damage, potentially killing Turkish citizens -- as happened on Oct. 3, when Syrian artillery landed in Akcakale, a Turkish border town. 
As long as Syrian shells continue to fall on Turkish territory, Turkey will respond in kind. As Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, ''although Turkey does not want war, it is close to war.'' If the situation continues to escalate, Turkey's history suggests that it is likely to follow one of three paths: continued low-intensity shelling, cross-border strikes or an actual invasion.
The first response for Ankara would be to continue the current pattern of shelling across the border every time Syria targets Turkey. This would weaken Syrian forces in some areas near the Turkish border, letting the F.S.A. fill the vacuum. This wouldn't create a contiguous safe haven, but it would lead to pockets of F.S.A.-held territory inside Syria under a de facto Turkish security umbrella.
The second would combine shelling with cross-border raids to target Kurdish militants in Syria. Turkey's policy, after all, is not just about Syria. It also depends on the Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the P.K.K., and its Syrian affiliate, the Party for Democratic Unity, or P.Y.D. Turkey views the P.K.K. as an existential threat, and the P.Y.D. is reportedly already active in Syrian towns near the Turkish border, though the group has said it does not plan to fight Turkey. If Turkey believes that Kurdish militants are turning Syria into a staging ground for operations against Turkey, the Turkish military would strike decisively, as it did against Kurds in northern Iraq after Saddam Hussein's rule effectively ended there in the 1990s. Ankara might go for the ''northern Iraq option'' once again to prevent Kurdish militants from taking control of northern Syria.
Finally, if things get worse along the border, causing more Turkish casualties, Turkey may go even further, staging a limited invasion to contain the crisis as it did in Cyprus in the 1970s. At that time, Ankara waited patiently for the United States and the international community to come to its aid in Cyprus. When such help did not materialize, Turkey took matters into its own hands, and landed troops on the island.
NATO has already issued a statement that it will defend Turkey against Syria. Yet if Turkey decides that the international community is not going to actually help stave off the Assad regime's aggression, it may choose the Cyprus option. The Turkish president, Abdullah Gul, has suggested that Ankara may be getting closer to its threshold, declaring on Oct. 8 that ''worse-case scenarios'' are looming in Syria and calling upon the international community to act.
The Cyprus scenario is the least desirable for Turkey. Full-scale war is not in its interest, especially if Turkey launches such a campaign without American backing. And NATO support under Article 5 of the alliance's charter, which calls for all NATO members to come to the defense of any member that is attacked, would be harder to muster. Article 5 has been activated only once in NATO's history and that was after the 9/11 attacks. Moreover, European nations like France haven't in the past been keen to come to Turkey's defense. A unilateral war against the Assad regime would also irritate the United States and anger Russia and Iran, Ankara's rivals in Syria -- a serious concern because Moscow and Tehran have a track record of supporting Kurdish militants.
The northern Iraq option would not necessarily raise America's ire, but it would expose Turkey to further P.K.K. attacks, including ones backed by Iran. Tehran already appears to be encouraging the P.K.K. to punish Turkey for its stance in Syria. Major attacks could hurt Turkey's economy and erode Mr. Erdogan's popularity.
This leaves Turkey with the status quo -- retaliating to Syrian artillery fire by shelling across the border. Yet this will not solve the Syria crisis. Only an effective arms embargo and a multilateral intervention to create safe havens for civilians will stop the slaughter.
The cost of intervention in Syria may be high now, but the price will only increase for all nations if civilian massacres continue unabated. Currently, Syria looks eerily similar to Bosnia in the early 1990s. When the world did not act to end the slaughter of Muslims there, jihadists moved in to join the fight, and they sought to convince the otherwise staunchly secular-minded Bosnian Muslims that the world had abandoned them and that they were better off with jihadists. In Bosnia, the international community intervened before it was too late. If Syria radicalizes, becoming a jihadist safe haven, it could become a Sisyphean task to normalize it. Afghanistan is a case in point.

HEADLINE: A Fiery Rally, Then More Debate Study for Obama

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and TRIP GABRIEL; Helene Cooper reported from Coral Gables, and Trip Gabriel from Asheville, N.C.

 BODY:
CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- To campaign or to study? For President Obama, that has become the question.
On the calendar, there are 25 days until the election. But if there is one thing that emerged after Mr. Obama's performance in last week's debate in Denver, it is that it may be better for him to spend his time preparing for the next one than to stump for votes.
So his advisers are sending the president to study hall. He will hole up in Williamsburg, Va., starting on Saturday to get ready for debate No 2 on Long Island next Tuesday, and then will do the same thing next weekend at Camp David, the presidential retreat in rural Maryland. His aides have been impressing upon him the need to aggressively confront Mitt Romney -- who spent part of Thursday on debate practice himself -- for shifting his position on a variety of issues. 
On Thursday, in a speech at the University of Miami's basketball arena, the president sounded like a student who has been paying attention in class. He delivered a full-throated, derisive attack on Mr. Romney's move to the center.
''Now, Governor Romney thinks we have not been paying attention for the last year and a half,'' Mr. Obama said. ''He is going to say exactly anything he can to close the deal.''
Then the president adopted the cadence of a Baptist preacher: ''Now, Florida, we gotta tell them his plan will not create jobs; it will not help the middle class. We can't afford it, we're not going back, we're moving forward, and that's why I'm running for a second term as president of the United States.''
Mr. Obama, when he wants, is light years more effective on the stump than he is in a debate hall. At the University of Miami, the president was energized, displaying the fire that he did not show during the debate. He worked the audience, making people laugh and cheer. And he directed zinger after zinger at Mr. Romney.
Mr. Romney, the president charged, ''is trying to go through an extreme makeover.''
''After running for more than a year in which he called himself severely conservative, Mitt Romney's trying to convince you that he was severely kidding,'' Mr. Obama said.
He chuckled. ''Suddenly, he loves the middle class. Can't stop talking about them. He loves Medicare, loves teachers. He even loves the most important parts of Obamacare,'' he said, referring to the health care overhaul.
Where this Barack Obama was during last week's debate is anybody's guess. But here, he took Mr. Romney to task time and again.
''Tax breaks for outsourcers? He's never heard of such a thing!'' the president said. ''Kicking 100,000 young Floridians off their parents' insurance plan -- who, me?''
Yet the new study schedule, which leaves the president with a bare 16 days to campaign after debate preparation, could take away his more potent weapon: himself. Mr. Obama's advisers, aware that far more people watch the debates than a campaign appearance, say they must strike a balance.
The tightened race -- polls show that Mr. Romney has narrowed Mr. Obama's lead in some crucial states -- heightens the impact of the shortened time frame. That is particularly true here in Florida, which has 29 electoral votes and which became the nation's most infamous swing state after the Bush-Gore election recount in 2000. Its electorate is a diverse mix of conservative Southerners, Hispanics, African-Americans and elderly and Jewish voters.
Mr. Romney faces similarly vexing demands on his time. After debate practice Thursday morning, he traveled to Asheville, N.C., a state that has received fewer visits from the two presidential campaigns than other battlegrounds, even though polls show the race to be tight there.
Some local Republican strategists expressed frustration that Mr. Romney had not already taken the state out of competition, given that North Carolina's unemployment rate is the fifth-highest in the nation and Mr. Obama's margin of victory in 2008 was the slimmest of any state.
They questioned the Romney campaign's messaging strategy in the state, which seems generic rather than tailored to North Carolina. Mr. Romney has run an advertisement starring Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is not well known in North Carolina, and he appeared at an Asheville rally with House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio -- a symbol to independent voters of gridlock in Washington.
A key reason for Mr. Romney's trip to the state was to pay a visit to the Rev. Billy Graham, a religious adviser to Republican presidents since Dwight D. Eisenhower. Retired and frail at 93, Mr. Graham remains a potent symbol to evangelical Christian voters, an important part of the Republican base Mr. Romney will need to turn out strongly in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans.

HEADLINE: Biden and Ryan Quarrel Aggressively in Debate, Offering Contrasts

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG; Jeff Zeleny reported from Danville, Ky., and Jim Rutenberg from New York.

 BODY:
DANVILLE, Ky. -- It was the debate that President Obama and Mitt Romney did not have a week ago.
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Representative Paul D. Ryan fiercely quarreled at the vice-presidential debate here on Thursday night, with Mr. Biden using the cutting attack lines against the Republican ticket that Mr. Obama did not and Mr. Ryan delivering a spirited case for conservative policies that Mr. Romney had soft-pedaled.
The 90-minute debate, which unfolded in rapid tempo, offered a spirited airing of the sharp contrasts over the administration's handling of the terrorist attack in Libya, the pace of the economic recovery at home and the role of government in addressing the nation's fiscal burdens.
While Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney were not on stage, they were at the center of the conversation as their running mates made certain the evening was squarely focused on defining the men at the top of the ticket. But, under pressure to pass the test, Mr. Ryan displayed a proficiency in areas like foreign policy and kept pace with Mr. Biden, who is 27 years his senior. 
It was Mr. Biden who sought to quiet the rising clamor among Democrats that the president was not assertive enough with Mr. Romney at their debate last week in Denver. A day after Mr. Obama conceded he was ''too polite,'' Mr. Biden showed no hesitation in hectoring, heckling and interrupting his challenger.
Within a single minute, Mr. Biden worked in three attacks on his rivals, referring to Mr. Romney's opposition to the auto industry bailout, his statement that the foreclosure crisis would have to ''run its course'' and his comment about ''47 percent'' of Americans who he said were overreliant on government benefits.
''These guys bet against America all the time,'' said Mr. Biden, whose temperature was running close to boil for most of the evening.
Mr. Ryan, who kept his composure for most of the night, suggested that Mr. Romney misspoke when talking about the 47 percent. He added pointedly, ''I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way.''
But Mr. Biden retorted sharply: ''But I always say what I mean. And so does Romney.''
The two men walked on stage in Newlin Hall on the campus of Centre College and took their seats around a table, rather than standing at lecterns as their counterparts did last week. They repeatedly talked over each other, but Martha Raddatz of ABC News, the moderator, pressed both men at various points to explain themselves better.
At one point, she argued directly with Mr. Biden over misgivings among some in the military about the timing of pulling troops from Afghanistan during the warmer months, when fighting is often heavier. When Mr. Biden disputed that the timing was political, Ms. Raddatz said: ''Trust me. There are people who were concerned about pulling out on the fighting season.''
Mr. Ryan offered a point-by-point rebuttal of the vice president, accusing the administration of lacking ''credibility'' in its international approach to Iran because it sent mixed signals and asserting that the tough sanctions came about only because of the fortitude of Congress, as the administration sought to ''water down'' the trading restrictions.
He sharply criticized the administration's handling of the terrorist strike in Libya that killed the American ambassador, saying: ''It took the president two weeks to acknowledge that this was a terrorist attack. Look, if we're hit by terrorists, we're going to call it what it is, a terrorist attack.''
Mr. Ryan chastised Mr. Obama, questioning why the United States did not have protection for the diplomatic compound. He declared, ''This is becoming more troubling by the day.''
But as Mr. Biden reminded Mr. Ryan that he and House Republicans cut the budget for the security, he sought to use the question about the attack in Libya to immediately begin the attack on Mr. Romney's positioning. He contrasted Mr. Obama's overall foreign policy record with Mr. Romney's, ranging from Iraq to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
''The president has led with a steady hand and clear vision; Governor Romney hasn't,'' Mr. Biden said. ''The last thing we need is another war.''
Throughout the evening, Mr. Biden made maximum use of the split-screen shots that were judged to have harmed Mr. Obama a week earlier, when he was frequently shown looking down at his lectern as Mr. Romney harshly criticized him. And whenever Mr. Ryan spoke, Mr. Biden claimed his half of the screen as his own, practically winking at the audience at home as he stage-laughed at the assertions Mr. Ryan was making or shook his head in disbelief, grinning broadly.
His interruptions were strategic, intended to raise questions about the Republican ticket. When Mr. Ryan attacked the administration's stimulus program, Mr. Biden pointed out that Mr. Ryan had sent him a letter, requesting money for his Congressional district in Wisconsin.
As soon as the debate was over, Republicans were trying to liken Mr. Biden's performance to that of Al Gore against George W. Bush in 2000, when unflattering cutaway camera shots caught him sighing and rolling his eyes impatiently as Mr. Bush spoke.
But while the two campaigns awaited the results of ''insta-polls'' determining a winner and a loser, the key question would not come as quickly: Whether Mr. Biden did enough to help move the Obama campaign beyond the president's own listless debate performance a week earlier. At one point Mr. Ryan even made reference to his imperative to do so, telling him, ''I know you're under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground.''
It was the biggest moment of the campaign for Mr. Ryan, who invigorated the Republican base in August when Mr. Romney asked him to join the ticket. But his role as chairman of the House Budget Committee also opened him up to significant criticism from Mr. Biden, particularly when Mr. Ryan promised a bipartisanship that he said Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden had not delivered as promised.
Before the debate, Democrats were curious about whether Mr. Ryan would stand by his approach to Medicare, which has included different versions of a plan to offer people 65 and older an option to use government subsidies to purchase private insurance. He did, and then some, saying his only intention -- and Mr. Romney's -- was to ensure the program's longevity.
''Medicare and Social Security did so much for my own family,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''We are not going to jeopardize this program, but we have to save it.''
Looking into the camera, Mr. Biden said, ''These guys haven't been big on Medicare from the beginning,'' asking the audience bluntly, ''Who do you trust on this?'' To Mr. Ryan, he said, ''You are jeopardizing this program.''
Mr. Ryan accused Mr. Biden and Mr. Obama of using ''scare tactics.''
''This is what politicians do when they don't have a record to run on,'' Mr. Ryan said, ''try to scare people from voting for you.''
The two men, both Roman Catholic, showed sharp differences on how their faith informed their views on abortion.
Mr. Biden said he accepted the church position that life begins at conception, but added, ''I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and Muslims and Jews,'' and that ''I do not believe we have the right to tell women that they can't control their body.''
The issue was potentially thornier for Mr. Ryan, since his opposition to abortion has at times extended to cases of rape and incest, unlike that of his running mate, who makes exceptions for such cases.
''I respect people who don't agree with me on this, but the policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortion with the exceptions of rape, incest and the life of the mother,'' Mr. Ryan said.

HEADLINE: Bipartisan Spin On Medicare Plan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER, JONATHAN WEISMAN and ERIC SCHMITT

 BODY:
As Representative Paul D. Ryan debated Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday night, he sometimes seemed to be defending his own past budget and Medicare proposals as much as his running mate's plans -- sometimes in misleading ways.
When Mr. Ryan was defending his plan to reshape Medicare so future beneficiaries would receive fixed amounts of money to purchase private insurance or buy into the existing government program -- a model for Mitt Romney's proposal -- he described his plan as ''bipartisan,'' and called it ''a plan I put together with a prominent Democrat senator from Oregon.'' But he failed to note that he later lost that Democrat's support.
Mr. Ryan was referring to a paper outlining a Medicare plan that he drafted in December with Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat of Oregon. But Mr. Wyden withdrew his support of the plan after Mr. Ryan reduced the rate at which the federal subsidies would grow -- a key point that could decide whether future beneficiaries would face higher out-of-pocket costs as a result of the new program. 
Mr. Ryan also said that the Romney-Ryan plan would not affect people ''in or near retirement.'' While their plan to reshape Medicare would not, their proposal to repeal President Obama's health care law would, because the law has a provision that helps Medicare recipients pay for prescription drugs, to help cover the gap known as the ''doughnut hole.'' So far this year, the Department of Health and Human Services said last month, the law saved the average recipient $641 on drug coverage.
Here is a closer look at the Medicare debate, as well as other foreign and domestic policy questions that came up Thursday night.
Medicare Comparisons
No program faces bigger changes under Mr. Ryan's budget than Medicare, and his plan to overhaul the program forms the basis in many respects for Mr. Romney's plan.
Mr. Ryan's plan calls for reshaping the current government-sponsored, defined benefit fee-for-service insurance system. Under his plan, which would begin a decade from now, each beneficiary would receive a fixed amount of money -- Democrats call it a ''voucher'' -- to purchase private insurance or buy into the existing government program. Under the most recent Ryan plan the money, known as ''premium support,'' would rise each year by the growth of the economy, plus 0.5 percentage points, considerably slower than health care's current rate of inflation.
Mr. Ryan believes competition will drive down the cost of health care, keeping the voucher's value up to date. The Congressional Budget Office projected that over time, the value of the voucher would erode, shifting the extra costs to seniors.
Critics also warn that under Mr. Ryan's plan, private insurers would try to sign up the healthiest seniors, leaving the sickest, most-expensive-to-cover seniors to enroll in the government program. That would raise the government's costs and steeply erode the value of those seniors' vouchers.
Mr. Biden noted that Mr. Ryan's original Medicare plan would have cost future beneficiaries $6,400 in higher costs and questioned what his current plan would cost. But it is difficult to assess what Mr. Romney's plan would cost, because he has not released key details.
Unlike Mr. Ryan, who proposed capping the growth of premium support to the growth of the economy, plus 0.5 percentage points, Mr. Romney has not specified how much money he would give to future beneficiaries to buy coverage, or how fast it would grow -- making the effects of his proposal difficult to assess.
The Romney campaign's policy director, Lanhee Chen, wrote that while higher-income seniors might be asked to pay more under Mr. Romney's plan, ''all seniors will be guaranteed sufficient support because the support is actually set based on what plans will cost.''
But the campaign has not said how its plan would work.
MICHAEL COOPER
and JONATHAN WEISMAN
On the Stimulus
Mr. Ryan issued a broadside against Mr. Obama's stimulus plan, noting that it did not keep unemployment below 8 percent, as Mr. Obama's economic advisers projected it would before he took office. Mr. Biden defended the bill, saying it had helped the economy recover. Who is right?
Before Mr. Obama took office, his economic team issued a paper calling for the passage of a large economic stimulus plan, and printed a chart that they later came to regret. The chart projected that the unemployment rate would remain below 8 percent with a stimulus plan and hit 9 percent without one. (A footnote warned: ''Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11 percent in the absence of action.'')
In fact, the unemployment rate had already hit 8.3 percent in February 2009, Mr. Obama's first full month in office and the month he signed the stimulus into law. It peaked at 10 percent that October and dropped to 7.8 percent last month.
There is plenty of debate over how effective Mr. Obama's economic policies have been, especially given the painfully slow recovery. But even critics who believe that the president's stimulus law was a missed opportunity -- from liberals who say it was too small to conservatives who say it was wasteful and poorly targeted -- tend to acknowledge what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has found: that it did save or create jobs, lower the unemployment rate and help the economy grow in the short term.
MICHAEL COOPER
The Libya Attack
The debate started with moderator Martha Raddatz focusing on the terrorist attack last month in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.
''Wasn't this a massive intelligence failure, Vice President Biden?'' Ms. Raddatz asked.
Mr. Biden did not answer the question. Instead, he mourned the loss of the Americans and vowed that the government would ''get to the bottom of it.''
Republicans have singled out Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador to the United Nations, for criticism, and Mr. Ryan continued that critique. On Sept. 16, Ms. Rice said that the attack on the compound in Benghazi had begun with an angry protest of an anti-Islamic film that was ''hijacked'' by extremists. It was not until three days later that Matthew G. Olsen, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, became the first official to call the assault a terrorist attack.
Ms. Rice said she was using information provided to her by American intelligence agencies, a defense Mr. Biden repeated. ''The intelligence community told us that,'' Mr. Biden said. ''As they learned more facts about exactly what happened, they changed their assessment.'' That is, indeed, what the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said on Sept. 28.
But in the hours after the Benghazi attack, American officials have said, spy agencies intercepted electronic communications from fighters from Ansar al-Shariah, a local extremist group, bragging to an operative with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the terror group's North African franchise. Another intercept captured cellphone conversations of militants on the grounds of the smoldering American Mission in Benghazi that suggested links to, or sympathies for, the regional Qaeda group.
Republicans have pointed to this information as evidence that American officials suspected the involvement of the Qaeda franchise much earlier than the administration publicly acknowledged. ERIC SCHMITT

HEADLINE: A Debate With Clarity and Fervor

 BODY:
Thursday night's vice-presidential debate was one of the best and meatiest political conversations in many years, showing that real differences on public policy can be discussed with fervor, anger, laughter and real substance. In contrast to the dismal meeting last week between President Obama and Mitt Romney, this debate gave voters a chance to evaluate the positions of the two tickets, in part because Representative Paul Ryan's nonanswers were accurate reflections of his campaign.
Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. would not sit still for a parade of misleading and often blatantly untruthful descriptions of the state of the economy and the Republican prescriptions for it. Though his grins and head-shakes were often distracting, he did not hesitate to interrupt and demand an end to ''malarkey.'' The result, expertly controlled by the moderator, Martha Raddatz of ABC News, was both entertaining and enlightening. 
Mr. Ryan, as always, refused to acknowledge the improvement in the economy, at one point throwing out a canned talking point about the increase in unemployment in the depressed industrial city of Scranton, Pa., Mr. Biden's hometown. ''That's how it's going all around America,'' he said, ignoring the steady reduction in the national jobless rate, which dipped to 7.8 percent last month.
''You don't read the statistics,'' Mr. Biden said, jumping in. ''That's not how it's going. It's going down.'' He repeatedly pointed out that Mr. Romney had firmly opposed the federal bailout of the auto industry, which turned out to be the single biggest act of job creation in the last four years. Mr. Ryan responded weakly that Mr. Romney was a ''car guy,'' but offered little in the way of economic proposals beyond cutting taxes and ridiculing the Obama administration's stimulus program.
The vice president, who was in charge of that program, actually defended it, breaking with his campaign's usual reticence to discuss an enormously successful effort that, he pointed out, kept the economy from going over a cliff. And he showed Mr. Ryan's hypocrisy on the subject by pointing out that the congressman had asked for stimulus money for his state of Wisconsin, just as other Republicans did even as they vilified the program.
Mr. Ryan's performance on foreign affairs and military issues was at best disingenuous and at worst bumbling. He said he and Mr. Romney agreed with the administration's planned 2014 pullout from Afghanistan but still thought it was a bad idea, a bizarre nonresponse that did little but confuse voters.
He never said what more a Romney administration would do about Syria than is already being done. And on Iran, he simply repeated Republican talking points about Mr. Obama's ''weakness'' but did not say what Mr. Romney would do differently that would actually affect Iran's nuclear program, apart from starting a war. He had no answer when the moderator asked how effective he thought military action be.
Mr. Biden refused to ignore the condescending remarks that Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney have made toward the least fortunate, regularly described by the Republican ticket as ''takers'' who are irresponsibly dependent on government. That attitude, he noted, is reflected in the Republican tax plan that favors the rich. In one of his most effective summaries, he said that if Republicans would just ''get out of the way,'' there might be real action on middle-class tax cuts, jobs bills and mortgage relief.
''Stop talking about how you care about people,'' he said. ''Show me something.'' Mr. Ryan's predictable response: You said the stimulus would fix the entire economy and it didn't. But he had no responsible answer for increasing growth.
Both candidates, however, demonstrated real engagement on issues that matter. It was a real change for voters starved for substance.

HEADLINE: Japan: Cooperation Is Promised

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- The finance ministers of Japan and South Korea declared on Thursday that their nations would closely cooperate on economic and financial issues, in talks aimed at limiting the political damage from a diplomatic clash over contested islands.
The talks took place during annual meetings in Tokyo of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank that were supposed to focus largely on the debt crisis in Europe. Instead, they have been at least partly overshadowed by concerns that the rekindling of territorial disputes in eastern and southeastern Asia could hurt the region's vital role as a source of growth for the global economy. 
On Thursday, the head of the I.M.F., Christine Lagarde, told participants that fixing Europe's debt problems and averting drastic fiscal cuts in the United States were needed to lift global economic confidence. That lack of confidence is ''having a ripple effect on emerging markets, and in particular in Asia,'' Ms. Lagarde said.
The I.M.F. has already lowered its global growth forecast to 3.3 percent this year from 3.5 percent, and has warned of further downward revisions if the American and European financial problems remain unresolved.
At such a crucial time, Ms. Lagarde said it was important for relatively robust economies in Asia to not let their differences over territory or history prevent them from working together to pull the global economy out of its long slump.
''We hope that differences, however longstanding, can be resolved harmoniously and expeditiously so that from an economic point of view cooperation can continue,'' she said. ''We are all very closely interconnected.''
The risk of these problems spilling over into the economy was highlighted on Wednesday, when Japan announced that China's top finance officials would not be attending the meetings, apparently to show displeasure with Japan as part of a dispute over islands claimed by both nations in the East China Sea. The row has already hurt trade ties between Asia's two largest economies, as Chinese consumers have boycotted Japanese goods.
Ms. Lagarde said the Chinese officials would lose out by not attending. ''We have a lot of substantive issues to discuss,'' she said.
That the Japanese and South Korean officials met at all was seen by many here as a hopeful sign. Relations between Japan and South Korea have markedly deteriorated since August, when the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, visited the disputed islands, known as Dokdo in Korean and Takeshima in Japanese. The small island group is claimed by both nations but controlled by South Korea. That visit came a little more than a month after Mr. Lee's government abruptly announced that it would sign a military cooperation pact with Japan aimed at increasing their ability to grapple with the threat from North Korea, a move that drew intense domestic criticism and forced South Korea to abandon the deal, to the dismay of the United States.
The talks on Thursday between Japan's finance minister, Koriki Jojima, and the South Korean strategy and finance minister, Bahk Jae-wan, were one of the first meetings between top officials of the two nations since Mr. Lee's island trip.
The talks showed few concrete results, beyond a vague commitment to resume regular, lower-level talks between the two nations' finance officials. Still, the two ministers agreed that their nations should maintain their close economic ties.
''We agreed to closely cooperate in the area of economy and finance,'' Mr. Jojima told reporters.
The two ministers also sought to play down the political significance of a decision this week to shrink the size of an emergency bailout plan that Tokyo had previously offered South Korea to prop up its currency during the European debt crisis. The nations agreed to reduce the size of the so-called currency swap contract to $13 billion from $70 billion, saying that markets had sufficiently stabilized to the point that such a large bailout was no longer needed.
However, the reduction was widely seen as a sign of cooling ties between Japan and South Korea. Japan's previous finance minister had threatened to end the swap agreement after Mr. Lee followed up his visit to the disputed islands by saying the Japanese emperor should apologize for Japan's brutal early 20th-century colonization of the Korean Peninsula.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: To Save the Middle Class, Act Globally

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- President Barack Obama did a miserable job of making his own case last week. But speak to his supporters and the pitch is clear: The American middle class is being hollowed out; Mr. Obama's self-appointed mission is to try to save it.
That is what I heard from Jeffrey Liebman, one of the president's economic advisers, at a debate about the election I moderated at Columbia University on Monday. Mr. Liebman said the central difference between his candidate and Mitt Romney was the president's view that trickle-down economics doesn't work. Instead, he believes policy needs to focus on the middle class. Economic growth, he said, should come from the middle and radiate out. 
In a separate interview, Mark Gallogly, co-founder of the private equity and credit investment firm Centerbridge Partners and one of Mr. Obama's earliest supporters on Wall Street, likewise emphasized the middle class. The president's overriding concern, Mr. Gallogly told me, was with the workers who make $24,000 a year. Their lot is a pressing issue, Mr. Gallogly argued, because even before the recession there had been persistent downward pressure on middle-class wages. Yesterday's middle-class job can land you today among the working poor.
You may be tempted to say that focusing on the middle class is about as distinctive as supporting motherhood. That is true enough. Two things stand apart in the Obama administration's analysis of the problem.
One -- and this is what has really riled the billionaire set -- is Mr. Obama's belief that making the world safe for American business doesn't automatically translate into a rescue of the American middle class. The second, related idea is that the globalized, high-tech economy of the 21st century poses a particular challenge to the sorts of well-paid jobs that were the backbone of the U.S. middle class in the 20th.
These are two powerful assertions. What is missing is the connection between this domestic focus on the middle-class American worker and Mr. Obama's foreign policy agenda.
At this stage in the campaign, it would probably be political malpractice to ask the president to venture into this esoteric land, appealingly dubbed ''geo-economics'' by its most wonkish explorers. So far only Tom Friedman of The New York Times has managed to explore this terrain and retain his popular following, and a lot of proper nouns and metaphors have been tortured in the process.
But if the president is serious about creating a 21st-century agenda for the American middle class, he needs to connect the dots between his domestic and foreign policy in a new way. (Judged on his own terms, this intellectual challenge is less pressing for Mr. Romney, who is sticking with the Reaganomics view that the way to aid the middle class is to support American job-creating businesses and individuals through lower taxes and less regulation.)
It isn't hard to explain why a domestic middle-class jobs policy has to be part of Mr. Obama's foreign policy. In a globalized economy, jobs no longer need a passport, but workers do. Creating jobs for your country's workers is about much more than ensuring that the balance sheets of your country's companies are strong, or stimulating domestic demand. It is about figuring out how your country's workers fit into the global economy.
But while that problem has become obvious to a lot of us, the solutions are more elusive. In lieu of answers, here are a few starting points.
The first is to understand and accept that the old link between the prosperity of your nation's companies and of your nation's middle-class workers is much more fragile than it was in the past. The operative word is accept -- the left scores political points, but offers little substance, when it berates chief executives or private equity investors for making profits even as they shrink their domestic workforce.
Corporations are not employment agencies, and judging them by that metric is a mistake. Likewise, while it can be fun for liberals to criticize business for going global, consider the alternative: Would America, or any other modern industrialized nation, really be better off if its companies failed to integrate themselves into the world economy?
A related idea is to understand that capital, and capitalists, really have become global. Here, again, the liberal temptation is to mock the billionaires who threaten to pull a John Galt and exit the national economy if they are mistreated. But as the example of Eduardo Saverin, the co-founder of Facebook who renounced his U.S. citizenship, shows, this threat has moved from Ayn Rand's 1950s fantasy to real life.
Finally, to end on an encouraging note, champions of their own national middle class need to start seeing their problem as a global one. We are used to thinking about the traditional concerns of foreign policy -- wars, disarmament, even energy and the environment -- as international issues that require some degree of collective action. The hollowing out of the middle class is a problem common to all Western industrialized economies. Maybe we should work together to solve it.

HEADLINE: U.S. Panel to Hear Opponents of Renewing Licenses for Indian Point Nuclear Plant

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The Indian Point nuclear plant is going on trial.
On Monday, the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission will open a hearing to determine whether opponents, among them the Cuomo administration, have valid arguments against a 20-year extension of operating licenses for the Westchester County site's reactors.
Three administrative law judges from the commission will take up an unusually long list of issues at the hearing, which will take place at a hotel in Tarrytown, N.Y., on 12 days in October and December. 
In granting license extensions for reactors around the country, 70 to date, the commission has usually agreed to hear arguments on only a few technical issues. But in the case of Indian Point, the judges will hear at least 14.
Some of the issues from parties in the case are mechanical. Has Entergy, the plant's owner, properly accounted for the possibility of corrosion in old pipes? What is the condition of the plant's electrical cables, some of which are submerged in water and cannot be easily inspected? Has the plant been adequately monitoring buried pipes, some of which have already leaked, that carry radioactive materials?
Others are more slippery, like calculating the potential human costs of a major release of radioactive materials from the plant, in Buchanan, about 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan.
James Steets, a spokesman for Entergy, suggested that the plant's opponents would try ''to throw as much mud against the wall as they can and hope some of it sticks.''
''But by the same token,'' Mr. Steets added, ''it's a process that allows for those who seriously have concerns to raise issues in a very public process.''
Either way, the tug of war over Indian Point's future will probably go on for years. Ordinarily, the commission's decisions on extending licenses take two and a half years. But Indian Point's renewal application is now more than five years old, and the hearings have not even started.
The 40-year licenses of the plant's two reactors are set to expire in September 2013 and December 2015. But under agency rules, the licenses will remain in effect until the commission makes a final ruling.
Since his days as the New York State attorney general, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has been arguing that the plant should be closed -- that the reactors have safety problems and are vulnerable to terrorism. He has cited their proximity to nine million people in the New York metropolitan region.
The current attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, whose office represents the state in the hearings, has been slightly less emphatic.
''Whatever it is that the state determines to do, I'm the state's lawyer and I will defend that,'' Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat, said last summer in an interview with WMHT, a public television station in Albany. ''But I think they have a pretty steep hill to climb given the location of the plant and the population density around it and some of the problems that have come up with the plant.''
In a way, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is on trial, too, given that its staff has already concluded that relicensing is warranted.
After the three administrative law judges -- two engineers and a lawyer -- rule on the challenges, the losing side is expected to appeal directly to the five-member commission in Washington. If the commission upholds a challenge, Entergy will have to change hardware or procedures at Indian Point to solve the problem unless it decides that the cost makes retiring the plant more prudent economically.
Expert testimony from Entergy and the plant's opponents has already been filed, so much of the hearing will consist of cross-examination of witnesses and questions from the judges. The state is pressing for additional opportunities to cross-examine witnesses, and the commission plans to rule on that request on Friday.
Another avenue the state is pursuing to shut down Indian Point, the denial of a state water-use permit, could threaten the plant regardless of the commission's final decision. The state contends that the plant's cooling water technology kills too many fish when it draws water from the Hudson River and that Entergy should build cooling towers.
But a court could reverse that decision if it found that the state's real motivation was nuclear safety, a federal responsibility.

HEADLINE: Triumph Of The Wrong?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
In these closing weeks of the campaign, each side wants you to believe that it has the right ideas to fix a still-ailing economy. So here's what you need to know: If you look at the track record, the Obama administration has been wrong about some things, mainly because it was too optimistic about the prospects for a quick recovery. But Republicans have been wrong about everything.
About that misplaced optimism: In a now-notorious January 2009 forecast, economists working for the incoming administration predicted that by now most of the effects of the 2008 financial crisis would be behind us, and the unemployment rate would be below 6 percent. Obviously, that didn't happen. 
Why did the administration get it wrong? It wasn't exaggerated faith in the power of its stimulus plan; the report predicted a fairly rapid recovery even without stimulus. Instead, President Obama's people failed to appreciate something that is now common wisdom among economic analysts: severe financial crises inflict sustained economic damage, and it takes a long time to recover.
This same observation, of course, offers a partial excuse for the economy's lingering weakness. And the question we should ask given this unpleasant reality is what policies would offer the best prospects for healing the damage. Mr. Obama's camp argues for an active government role; his last major economic proposal, the American Jobs Act, would have tried to accelerate recovery by sustaining public spending and putting money in the hands of people likely to use it. Republicans, on the other hand, insist that the path to prosperity involves sharp cuts in government spending.
And Republicans are dead wrong.
The latest devastating demonstration of that wrongness comes from the International Monetary Fund, which has just released its World Economic Outlook, a report combining short-term prediction with insightful economic analysis. This report is a grim and disturbing document, telling us that the world economy is doing significantly worse than expected, with rising risks of global recession. But the report isn't just downbeat; it contains a careful analysis of the reasons things are going so badly. And what this analysis concludes is that a disproportionate share of the bad news is coming from countries pursuing the kind of austerity policies Republicans want to impose on America.
O.K., it doesn't say that in so many words. What the report actually says is: ''Activity over the past few years has disappointed more in economies with more aggressive fiscal consolidation plans.'' But that amounts to the same thing.
For leading Republicans have very much tied themselves to the view that slashing spending in a depressed economy -- ''fiscal consolidation,'' in I.M.F.-speak -- is good, not bad, for job creation. Soon after the midterm elections, the new Republican majority in the House of Representatives issued a manifesto on economic policy -- titled, ''Spend less, owe less, grow the economy'' -- that called for deep spending cuts right away and pooh-poohed the whole notion that fiscal consolidation (yes, it used the same term) might deepen the economy's slump. ''Non-Keynesian effects,'' the manifesto declared, would make everything all right.
Well, that turns out not to be remotely true. What the monetary fund shows is that the countries pursing the biggest spending cuts are also the countries that have experienced the deepest economic slumps. Indeed, the evidence suggests that in brushing aside the standard view that spending cuts hurt the economy in the short run, the G.O.P. got it exactly wrong. Recent spending cuts appear to have done even more harm than most analysts -- including those at the I.M.F. itself -- expected.
Which brings us to the question of what form economic policies will take after the election.
If Mr. Obama wins, he'll presumably go back to pushing for modest stimulus, aiming to convert the gradual recovery that seems to be under way into a more rapid return to full employment.
Republicans, however, are committed to an economic doctrine that has proved false, indeed disastrous, in other countries. Nor are they likely to change their views in the light of experience. After all, facts haven't gotten in the way of Republican orthodoxy on any other aspect of economic policy. The party remains opposed to effective financial regulation despite the catastrophe of 2008; it remains obsessed with the dangers of inflation despite years of false alarms. So it's not likely to give up its politically convenient views about job creation.
And here's the thing: if Mitt Romney wins the election, the G.O.P. will surely consider its economic ideas vindicated. In other words, politically good things may be about to happen to very bad ideas. And if that's how it plays out, the American people will pay the price.

HEADLINE: In Massachusetts, a Feisty Debate Helps Crystallize a Tight Race

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
SPRINGFIELD, Mass. -- Elizabeth Warren and Senator Scott P. Brown kept the pressure on each other throughout a feisty, hourlong debate here Wednesday night, suggesting that both had learned the perils of a passive performance last week from President Obama's poorly reviewed debate with Mitt Romney.
Still, the candidates in Massachusetts' increasingly combative Senate race managed through their slugfest to crystallize their ideological differences. 
Ms. Warren portrayed herself as someone who was being honest and realistic when she said she would ''raise revenues,'' a euphemism for taxes, and would even cut the military budget and redirect spending to education programs and improvements in the nation's infrastructure.
Mr. Brown said he would never raise taxes on anyone and particularly not in the midst of a three-year recession, because doing so would hurt the ''job creators'' and crush small businesses.
The debate was the third of four in this race, which could help determine control of the Senate next year. Mr. Brown, the Republican incumbent, and Ms. Warren, the Democratic challenger, are running neck and neck in the polls, making the race a true tossup and providing lively political theater for the 2,600 people in the audience here Wednesday night at Symphony Hall.
Absent this time was the subject that led off the two previous debates -- whether Ms. Warren can legitimately claim a Native American heritage and whether she used that heritage to advance her career. That absence made for a more policy-driven discussion, although Mr. Brown frequently cast his answers in personal terms.
His main theme, as it has been on the campaign trail, is that Ms. Warren is not who she claims to be.
Asked what the phrase ''middle class'' meant to them, Mr. Brown took a line from Ms. Warren's repertoire, saying it was about ''whose side you're on.'' Ms. Warren, he said, says she is on the side of the little guy but in fact is on the side of big corporations like Travelers Insurance and LTV Steel, for whom she has argued in court.
Ms. Warren said that examining the financial woes of the middle class had been her life's work. Using her oft-repeated phrase, she said the middle class was ''getting hammered'' while Republicans hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers to help them cut taxes for those at the top and ''let the chips fall where they may'' for everyone else.
Mr. Brown responded: ''When you talk about getting hammered, Professor Warren, I suggest you put down the hammer because it's your regulations and your policies.'' Here, his words were drowned out by loud boos from members of the audience, even though they had been told to keep quiet.
He continued in this vein, sounding amazed that she had denigrated lobbyists and lawyers because one of the state's ''premiere lobbyists,'' Doug Rubin, worked for her campaign. As for the army of lawyers, he retorted, ''You're one of them!''
Ms. Warren, who teaches at Harvard Law School, ignored the remark, nor did she mention that Mr. Brown is a lawyer too. She said she went to Washington to fight for a new consumer agency ''to make sure people didn't get cheated on mortgages.''
Mr. Brown then took credit for creating that agency. ''It never would have passed if I was not the deciding vote on it,'' he declared, prompting the audience to burst into laughter at the apparent gall. He ignored the laughter, adding: ''I'm glad I was able to help put it into effect.''
Ms. Warren said that her opponent had actually tried to weaken the bill that created the agency because he wanted to spare his donor friends on Wall Street from what they viewed as onerous regulations.
As in their previous two debates, Ms. Warren cast Mr. Brown as an unreliable vote on women's issues, though she did so more crisply than before.
In a direct appeal to women, she said that when Mr. Brown had the chance to vote for equal pay for equal work, he voted no; when he had the chance to vote for employers and insurers to pay for coverage for contraception, he voted no; when he had the chance to vote for a Supreme Court justice who supported abortion rights, he voted no.
''The women of Massachusetts need a senator they can count on -- not some of the time but all of the time,'' she said. Whether abortion remains legal, she said, ''may hang in the balance.''
Mr. Brown shot back that ''I didn't vote for your boss,'' a reference to Justice Elena Kagan, who was dean of the Harvard Law School. He said Ms. Kagan didn't have the requisite judicial experience.
At another point, Ms. Warren said Mr. Brown had voted twice to allow interest rates on student loans to double. He responded that ''she makes $350,000 to teach one course'' and received a zero-interest loan from Harvard. This, he said, is ''one of the driving forces behind the high costs of education.''
Only late in the debate did Ms. Warren try to explain why and how she would cut the military budget. She said that Mr. Brown's determination not to raise taxes meant that the budget would not be balanced and the deficit would not be reduced, which would lead to across-the-board cuts in all agencies. She would rather make planned cuts, such as by reducing the size of the standing army, she said, than allow across-the-board cuts that could hurt needed programs.
Asked where he would cut the government, Mr. Brown cited President Obama's health care law, which, he said, was crushing Massachusetts businesses. He said the law would remove $700 billion from Medicare, an assertion that Mr. Romney made in last week's presidential debate.
''That's the same playbook that Mitt Romney used a week ago tonight,'' Ms. Warren said. ''It was wrong then, it's wrong tonight.''
But generally, Ms. Warren did little to link Mr. Brown to Mr. Romney or to the Republican Party.
Their final debate is scheduled for Oct. 30, just a week before Election Day.

HEADLINE: The Fire This Time

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It was the Young Gun against the Old Hand, the reformer ready to turn the page on an aging social compact that dates to the New Deal jousting with the veteran -- alive for much of that compact's construction -- defending the tried and true.
How much change American voters are ready for may determine whom they side with in the days to come, Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, or the current vice president seeking another term, Joseph R. Biden Jr.
The lively, sometimes fiery vice-presidential debate Thursday night delineated battle lines that had been blurred when the men at the top of the ticket, President Obama and Mitt Romney, met a week ago. But for all the substance of the debate, the verdict among voters might ultimately hinge on their reactions to the very different demeanor of the two men on stage. 
As Mr. Ryan spoke, Mr. Biden sometimes grinned, sometimes smirked and often shook his head with disdain and dismissiveness toward Mr. Ryan, who he seemed to consider very much his junior adversary.
To some and particularly his party's combative liberal base, Mr. Biden's aggressiveness might have appeared both appropriate and overdue given Mr. Obama's more timid performance last week. Certainly his big personality came through, for better or worse, and he made sure to underscore his deep experience, citing his presence during big moments in the Reagan years.
Others could view Mr. Biden's performance as condescending or, as some Republicans tried to cast it, over the top and unworthy of his office.
If Mr. Biden was sometimes openly emotional, a hot on-screen presence, Mr. Ryan, 27 years his junior, was cooler, often coming off as confident, and fluent in the policy underlying his arguments. But at times he appeared flummoxed by Mr. Biden's aggressiveness and at moments was rendered speechless by the vice president's tactics.
On critical issues, Mr. Ryan did not shy from his and his party's plans to fundamentally alter Medicare. And while Mr. Romney had played down the benefit of the ticket's tax plan for the wealthy, his running mate fell back on Republican orthodoxy, defending ''small businesses'' and rich households from what he suggested was the rapacious reach of President Obama.
While he often sounded like the budget committee chairman he is, Mr. Ryan worked to match Mr. Biden in bringing a personal dimension to his arguments, citing the role Medicare and Social Security played in helping his family after the death of his father.
''There aren't enough rich people and small businesses to tax to pay for all their spending,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''And so the next time you hear them say, 'Don't worry about it. We'll get a few wealthy people to pay their fair share,' watch out, middle class. The tax bill is coming to you.''
Mr. Biden was equally steadfast, accusing Mr. Ryan of shifting a health care burden borne for decades by the government onto the elderly, and playing the populist on taxes.
''These guys haven't been big on Medicare from the beginning,'' Mr. Biden said, firmly wearing the hat of a Democrat raised in the glow of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
''Who you believe?'' he demanded in the shorthand of his hometown, Scranton, Pa. ''Me, a guy who's fought his whole life for this? Or somebody who had actually put in motion a plan that knowingly added $6,400 a year more to the cost of Medicare?''
It was inevitable that the vice-presidential debate would put a national spotlight on the ideas Mr. Ryan enshrined in two separate budget plans passed the last two years by the House of Representatives.
When he drafted them, Mr. Ryan foresaw the plans, the Roadmap for America in 2011 and the Path to Prosperity in 2012, as the ground on which Republicans would fight in the election.
''We need to say upfront, before the election, 'Here is what we want to do,' '' Mr. Ryan said in an interview in April. ''If we win the election, then we have the moral authority and the obligation to actually do it, not win on some vague platitudes, 'We're not Barack Obama,' then say, 'O.K., here's what we're doing because we now have a mandate.' ''
But since Mr. Romney named Mr. Ryan his running mate, that fight really has not materialized. Mr. Romney has not so much repudiated the Ryan budget as de-emphasized it, speaking vaguely of drafting his own plan if elected. He embraced Mr. Ryan's prescriptions for Medicare in principle but not in detail. On taxes, Mr. Romney has adopted the direction of Mr. Ryan's dictates -- cuts to all tax rates, offset by unexplained loophole closures -- but has not gone nearly as far.
Mr. Biden went to Danville, Ky., prepared to fight those ideas out. With his youth and his forthrightness, Mr. Ryan evokes conservative political change in a way Mr. Romney doesn't. Side by side with Mr. Biden, decades older, a generational clash leapt from the television screen.
The budget plans did not come up in detail until the debate's last moments, when Mr. Biden said: ''The two budgets the congressman introduced have eviscerated all the things that the middle class cares about. It has knocked 19 -- it will knock 19 million people off of Medicare. It will kick 200,000 children off of early education. It will eliminate the tax credit people have to be able to send their children to college. It cuts education by $450 billion. It does -- it does virtually nothing, except continue to increase the tax cuts for the very wealthy.''
But their prescriptions, especially on entitlements, were the center of the stormiest engagements throughout the night.
''Medicare and Social Security are going bankrupt. These are indisputable facts,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''If you reform these programs for my generation, people 54 and below, you can guarantee they don't change for people in or near retirement.''
The dispute was especially sharp over Medicare. Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney have proposed the most fundamental change to the program since Lyndon Johnson created it. The government's defined benefit, fee-for-service insurance system would be reshaped into a defined contribution system, much like guaranteed pensions have shifted to 401(k) plans. Each beneficiary would receive a fixed amount of money -- Mr. Biden called it a ''voucher'' -- to purchase private insurance or buy into the existing government program. The money, known as ''premium support,'' would rise each year by the growth of the economy, plus 0.5 percentage points, considerably slower than health care's current rate of inflation.
Mr. Ryan's belief is that competition would drive down the cost of health care, keeping the voucher's value up to date. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the value of the voucher would erode, shifting as much as $6,400 a year more to seniors.
And Mr. Biden saw it as his job to stand and say no.
''We will not be part of any voucher plan,'' he declared.

So it was ''The Honeymooners'' versus ''Family Ties''; Ed Norton versus Alex Keaton. What we saw Thursday night in the vice-presidential debate wasn't only an argument about policy, it was a look at two different eras in American family life.
Vice President Joe Biden, of course, could stand on Neptune and distract attention away from the sun. He entered the Senate in 1973, back when the old Democratic giants from the New Deal era still roamed the earth. Every sentimental tone of voice, every ebullient and condescending grin brought you back to the kitchen tables in working-class Catholic neighborhoods of places like Scranton, Pa., Chicago, San Francisco, Providence, R.I., and Philadelphia. 
That was a time, much more so than now, when there were still regional manners, regional accents and greater distance from the homogenizing influence of mass culture. That was a culture in which emotion was put out there on display -- screaming matches between family members who could erupt in chest-poking fury one second and then loyalty until death affection the next.
Biden gave America the full opera Thursday night, and I suspect there will be as many reactions as there are partisan flavors. Democrats will obviously be cheered by his aggressive, impassioned and offensive performance.
It will be the crowning irony of the No Drama Obama campaign that it took a man who exudes more drama than a decade of Latin American soap operas to get Democrats out of their funk.
Biden clearly ended the psychic slide. He took it to Representative Paul Ryan on the inexplicability of the Republican tax plan. He had his best moments on the subjects in which Ryan is strongest, like budgets.
At the same time, my in-box was filled with a certain number of people who would be happy if they could spend the next few weeks delivering some punches to Biden, and not just Republicans. What do independents want most? They want people who will practice a more respectful brand of politics, who will behave the way most Americans try to behave in their dealings: respectfully, maybe even pausing to listen for a second. To them, Biden will seem like an off-putting caricature of the worst of old-style politics.
This is not just an issue of manners. It is: How are we going to practice the kind of politics that will help us avert the so-called fiscal cliff? How are we going to balance the crosscutting challenges, like increasing growth while reducing long-term debt?
A lot of people will look at Biden's performance and see a style of politics that makes complex trade-offs impossible. The people who think this way swing general elections.
Ryan hails from a different era, not the era of the 1950s diner, but the era of the workout gym. By Ryan's time, the national media culture was pervasive. The tone was cool, not hot. The meritocracy had kicked in and ambitious young people had learned to adopt a low friction manner. Ryan emerges from this culture in the same way Barack Obama does.
This is a generation armed with self-awareness. In this generation, you roll your eyes at anyone who is quite so flamboyantly demonstrative as the vice president.
In addition, Ryan was nurtured by the conservative policy apparatus, and he had a tendency Thursday night to talk about policy even when he was asked about character. I would not say he defined a personality as firmly as he might have, but he did an excellent job of demonstrating policy professionalism. This debate was excessive in its attention to foreign policy -- an arena that is a voting issue for very few. Ryan demonstrated amazing fluency, given how little time he has spent working in these areas.
He was strong on Obama's economic failures, strong on the Libya debacle (though why do candidates always cram too many topics into their answers early in any debate), and he did have a few chances to highlight the Obama campaign's crucial weaknesses: the relative absence of any positive agenda and the relative absence of any large plans for the next four years.
By the end, voters will have noticed one large irony. Emotionally, Biden dominated the night. Democrats were wondering if the Obama administration was a spent force, too exhausted to carry on. They don't have to wonder about that anymore. But, substantively, it is the Romney-Ryan proposals that were the center of attention. Some of those proposals are unpopular (Medicare, which was woefully undercovered). Some are popular (taxes). But most of the discussion was on Romney plans because the other side just doesn't have many.
This was a battle of generations. The age difference was the undercurrent of every exchange. The older man had the virility, but, in a way, that will seem antique to many.

HEADLINE: One on One: Robin Sloan, Author and 'Media Inventor'

BYLINE: NICK BILTON


HIGHLIGHT: Robin Sloan, a former media manager at Twitter, is the author of the book "Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore: A Novel." He talks about how his work at Twitter influenced the book's themes. 

 BODY:
Robin Sloan is the author of the book "Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore: A Novel," published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. The book tells the story of Clay Jannon, an out-of-work, tech-obsessed Web designer who ends up getting a job at a San Francisco bookstore, where an adventure ensues. Mr. Sloan, 32, who has referred to himself as a "media inventor," wrote the book while working at Twitter as a media manager. The following is an edited interview.
 Q. Where did you come up with the idea for a 24-hour bookstore? 
A. From a tweet! I was walking down California Street in San Francisco, scrolling through Twitter on my phone, when I saw that a friend of mine had just tweeted: "Just misread a sign for a 24-hour book drop for 24-hour bookshop. My disappointment is beyond words." It just made me smile. I wrote it down, thought about it for a few months, and it eventually became the story of the 24-hour bookstore.
 Q. This was a short story before it became a novel, right? 
A. Yes. It started as a short story of about 6,000 words. In retrospective, it was really a prototype. I published it on my Web site, robinsloan.com, and made it available on the Kindle. It was based on the same theme: a story of recession, data visualization and romance.
 Q. How have your influences from working at Twitter crept into this book? 
A. There's a lot of technology in the book. It's not the tools of technology, it's the feelings of technology. I try to describe the feelings you get when you video chat, or the feelings you get from farming a job out to a thousand computers. That all came from my work at Twitter.
 Q. You talk about print versus digital in the book. Is print the new vinyl? 
A. I don't think so. People think the e-book debate is about books versus computers, but as it goes on, you realize that they actually have a lot in common. One of the things I'm trying get across is that books are just as much technology as your iPhone. When books were new, the scene felt just as chaotic and confusing as what's happening in San Francisco right now.
 Q. Who is the protagonist in your book? The book itself, or Clay, the main character? 
A. Clay is. But he's not a traditional protagonist, because he doesn't have all the answers himself.
 Q. Do you prefer to read print or digital? 
A. For me, it ebbs and flows. I have been reading a lot of print lately. Print books have an amazing superpower because they don't disappear when you're done with them. Books on the shelf remind you that they exist.
 Q. In your book you talk about content overload. How do we solve that? 
A. The problem is, all of this content is good. The vision of the Internet as a vast digital wasteland isn't correct. Everything is awesome and we have more stuff to read than we ever have in history. I think part of the answer comes with devices and interfaces: we need to create more devices without distractions, like Kindles.
 Q. You have a lot of current technology references in your book. Do you worry it will age quickly? 
A. I think there is a tradeoff inherent in contemporary references. The cost is that the book becomes dated very quickly. The benefit is that people reading it right now feel a dizzying present.
 Q. So I notice you have an old Nokia phone. Why? 
A. I realized that for me, the iPhone had gone beyond just being a habit. I decided that with the job I have now, which is a full-time writer, it's actually more important and more productive for me to be daydreaming and jotting down notes than it is for me to e-mail or read all my tweets.
 Q. Do you miss working at start-ups? 
A. I do miss working at Twitter because it is in the center of the zeitgeist right now, and it's fun to be in the middle of the zeitgeist.
 Q. The print version of your book glows in the dark. Why? 
A. I think in the year 2012, if you want people to forgo this super-convenient Kindle or Nook or iBooks edition, and get a big, heavy print book, you have to give them a really good reason.
 Q. Do use your book as a flashlight? 
A. Unfortunately it's not that bright. But we're waiting for version 2.0 of the longer-lasting glow-in-the-dark book. It might also run apps.

HEADLINE: The Limits to Liquidation Authority

BYLINE: STEPHEN J. LUBBEN


HIGHLIGHT: A challenge to the Dodd-Frank power by some states is not compelling, yet questions remain over how authorities would deal with subsidiaries when a big financial institution fails. 

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, three states - Oklahoma, Michigan, and South Carolina - joined a challenge to Title II of Dodd-Frank, the new "orderly liquidation authority."
The question is, why?
The arguments in the complaint are extraordinarily weak. The states seem to assert some sort of property interest in having their investments dealt with under the bankruptcy code in the event of default. Of course, Congress is free to change the bankruptcy code whenever it wants, so how does that work?
Moreover, nothing in the text ofthe bankruptcy clauseto the Constitution would seem to require Congress to provide a judicial forum for the resolution of financial distress. Indeed, entire categories of debtors - like banks and railroads - have at times been taken out of the general bankruptcy system and subjected to specialized proceedings, with limited judicial oversight.
None of which is to say that the orderly liquidation authority is prefect policy. But economic policy is probably best left outside the Constitutional realm.
As noted earlier this week by Harvey R. Miller and Maurice Horwitz in a Another View column on DealBook, the authority continues to suffer from its limited geographic scope and its unrealistic goals of ending all bailouts and liquidating failed financial firms, while also protecting the financial system from systemic panic.
It is probably not possible to do all of these things at once: in particular, sometimes we need the political courage to say that we need to do a bailout, as distasteful as that is, because we simply can't let Citigroup, Goldman Sachs or any other systemically important financial institution fail. By the time we get to the point of failure, the real alternatives are gone. 
The main goal then must be to do the bailout right.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's new approach to orderly liquidation authority - involving a single proceeding for the holding company alone - is a good step toward acknowledging that the process as drafted is not likely to work. But is it politically naïve?
In particular, its hard to see how an orderly liquidation authority proceeding of the parent company does not become a bailout of the subsidiaries, if those subsidiaries are to be kept out of any sort of insolvency proceeding. And knowing that this will happen, the smart money will come in at the subsidy level, leaving the parent company creditors those whom it is least politically palatable to stiff. Think small, individual investors.
Many of these issues could be at least ameliorated by aggressive enforcement of the rules regarding living wills. The problem is that most people are understandably dubious about aggressive enforcement by regulators - it didn't happen before, and why should we expect it to happen now, especially in the face of strong pushback from the banks and their champions in Congress

HEADLINE: The Queen of QVC Talks About the Risks of Dealing With Sharks

BYLINE: AMI KASSAR


HIGHLIGHT: Sometimes, taking on an investor can have unexpected consequences. 

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, I wrote a post about the popular reality show "Shark Tank" in which I discussed two entrepreneurs who decided not to participate because the producers insisted on taking a 5-percent stake in their company in exchange for the appearance.
As a follow-up, I recently had the chance to sit down with Lori Greiner, a k a the Queen of QVC, who recently made her debut as a full-time shark. We enjoyed a wide-ranging conversation -- which has been condensed and edited below -- about her hits and misses, the pros and cons of how entrepreneurs raise capital, and the lessons of "Shark Tank."
Every Friday night, millions of Americans of all ages sit down and watch the show, which encourages the belief that when a smart entrepreneur connects with a wealthy investor, the potential is unlimited. And sometimes it is. But when entrepreneurs and the investors enter into a contract, all parties need to think carefully about what the relationship means today -- and what it will mean in the future. For example, did you realize that if you take on an investor, you might not be able to get a bank loan unless your investor guarantees the loan personally? I think that's an important consideration for both investors and entrepreneurs.
 Q. 
 Why do you think "Shark Tank" is so successful? 
 A. 
In a down economy, a time where people are feeling that things are difficult, hopeless, they're worried they might lose their job, they tune in to Shark Tank, and they learn about how to possibly become their own boss.
 Q. 
 Q. 
 Do you think the show could do a better job of teaching about entrepreneurship? 
 A. 
Well, I think the show is what it is, and I think it has a great formula that people enjoy. And I do hear all the time from students in colleges across the country that "Shark Tank" is shown in their business classes.
 Q. 
 Can you share some of your "Shark Tank" lessons?
 A. 
Yes, well, my Reader Rest was wildly successful. I think it's the most successful product ever in "Shark Tank's" history. It's the magnetic glasses holder. We've gone well over 3 million in sales to date in less than a year.
 Q. 
 Are there deals that you've made on the show that haven't actually materialized into an investment? 
 A. 
Yes, there were a few. I was very disappointed about one of them, the Wine Balloon. I thought it was a great product, but he just wasn't interested in moving forward.
 Q. 
 So sometimes the deals break down in negotiations, or something changes in the product or in due diligence? 
 A. 
Well, sometimes in due diligence you find out things they didn't say in those minutes in front of you, so you can be disappointed or surprised by things. But so far for me I haven't had that issue beyond the Wine Balloon.
 Q. 
 If you were starting a company, would you give away 5 percent of it in exchange for being on "Shark Tank?" 
 A. 
Yes, I would.
 Q. 
 You think its worth it? 
 A. 
I do. To be able to get on "Shark Tank" is a tremendous opportunity, and if that means the difference between jump-starting your career and your idea or going nowhere, 5 percent is definitely worth it.
 Q. 
 Do you think it's a good idea for the entrepreneurs on the show to give away equity -- or should some consider debt?
 A. 
Well, I think the formulation on the show is that you are giving away an equity stake for X amount of dollars. And that's how the show operates, really.
 Q. 
 If you invest in a company and later the company needs a loan for working capital, would you be willing to personally guarantee that loan? 
 A. 
If I've invested in a company and they're doing well, I would be happy to keep investing more money into it.
 Q. 
 In exchange for more equity? 
 A. 
It depends on the situation, right? Each different situation with each different deal is different.
 Q. 
 We see so many loans today that where any investor who owns 20 percent or more of the company has to guarantee the loan personally. 
 A. 
Well, I think on "Shark Tank" we always joke that we're the bank and the tank. People aren't going to the banks for traditional loans. They're coming to us. So it's a different model. Do you follow me?
 Q. 
 A lot of entrepreneurs give away equity, and I think there's a trade off. We always tell them, if you're going to give away equity and you're going to give away more than 20 percent of your company, you better make sure that if you're going to need a loan in the future that your investor will be willing to personally guarantee it. Otherwise, you're going to have a problem. 
 A. 
I think a lot of people don't like to personally guarantee loans.
 Q. 
 Right, so does that inhibit the company's ability to grow? 
 A. 
No.
 Q. 
 What can the company do?
 A. 
Well, I can only put this situation for myself where, if I've invested and it's doing well and they need more money, I would put up more money for them.
 Q. 
 In exchange for more equity, though, right? 
 A. 
Probably. Its hard for me to answer this because it's a big hypothetical to me.
 Q. 
 Have you ever taken equity or debt for a company that you started?
 A. 
Honestly, this is a new way for me to operate. For the last 16 years, I've created my own products and I've helped other budding inventors with their products, and I have not chosen to go the path in taking an equity stake in their company.
 Q. 
 Right. This equity stuff gets complicated. But did you ever take investors for your own companies? 
 A. 
No, never.
 Q. 
 And did you ever need debt or loans? 
 A. 
I took out a loan with my first product, and that was it. That worked for me.
 Q. 
 And you stayed in control, right?
 A. 
Yes.
What do you think? If you had the opportunity to take an investment from Ms. Greiner or another Shark, would you consider it?

HEADLINE: The Drought That Changed the War

BYLINE: KENNETH W. NOE


HIGHLIGHT: How the drought of 1862 changed the course of fighting in the Western Theater. 

 BODY:
In August 1862, two Confederate armies turned north from Tennessee, hoping to revive their nation's faltering hopes west of the Appalachians. And yet, despite a stunning victory at Richmond, Ky., the capture of Frankfort, the state capital, the installation of a Confederate governor, and a tactical victory at Perryville on Oct. 8, by fall the two forces were limping back south. What happened?
Even as the two Confederate armies, one under Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith, the other under Gen. Braxton Bragg, as well as a pursuing force under Gen. Don Carlos Buell, all raced north across central Kentucky on parallel paths in what many soldiers likened to a great foot race, the men were suffering - brought low not just by the summer heat, but by vast dust clouds, increasingly short rations and a growing dearth of potable water. Both armies had marched headlong into a drought.
Food shortages, inflation and other hardships the Confederate plain folk suffered, as well as at least part of the disillusionment that grew out of those issues - the entire litany of the so-called "internalist" interpretation of Confederate defeat as a "rich man's war and poor man's fight" - actually can be traced back at least in part to the drought of 1862, its negative effect on Southern food production, and the choices the Jefferson Davis administration made when confronting the situation. The newborn Confederacy simply had been born at perhaps the worst possible moment in the 19th century to launch an agricultural republic. Meanwhile, Northern crops, especially Midwestern wheat, boomed.
Months earlier, Civil War soldiers would have found it hard to even imagine such a situation. The winter and spring of 1862 were unusually wet. High water and mud shaped campaigns in places as far apart as Fort Henry in western Tennessee and the bottomless swamps that Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan encountered on the Virginia Peninsula. 
The rains created problems of their own. Wet conditions led to widespread wheat rust, a fungus, which destroyed perhaps a sixth of the South's wheat crop. Flooding along the Mississippi and other rivers wrecked other spring crops in the field. 
Then, in the early summer, the heavens closed, and drought conditions set in. Agriculture suffered. With the notable exception of Georgia, the corn crop of 1862 largely failed, while the Montgomery Advertiser pronounced the Confederacy's wheat crop all but ruined. 
The armies confronted the great drought as well. The army of Union General Don Carlos Buell, sent from Corinth, Miss., in July to take Chattanooga, had endured much as rivers fell to levels too low to permit the shipping of supplies, leaving the men dependent on railroads that soon proved easy prey for marauding Rebel cavalry. 
The "great foot race" north in late August and September proved more agonizing still. James Iredell Hall of the 9th Tennessee wrote that "the only water accessible was pond water and that was warm and muddy. The water we were compelled to drink, was so muddy that we could not wash our faces in it." A Confederate soldier in the 33rd Alabama remembered that "we obtained water under deep limesinks, some of these being partly full of water, and Federals had utilized some of the partly filled sinks as a place to butcher cattle and dumped offal into them, making the water unfit to drink." 
The food situation was just as bad. Back in Tennessee and northern Alabama, both sides already had encountered trouble filling their bellies. Part of Buell's decision to retreat from Chattanooga was his supply situation; elderly locals testified that 1862 was the driest summer in their memory. Pillaging and disorder increased as hungry soldiers took what their commissaries could not supply. 
For his part, Bragg's plan depended upon living off the land as the Confederates marched north, a decision that quickly smashed into a dry reality: drought and the occupying Federal army had left little for them to eat. Bragg changed course with every new rumor of ample foodstuffs ahead. On Sept. 14, acting without orders, Brig. Gen. James Chalmers of Bragg's army and Col. John Scott, commanding a detachment of Kirby Smith's cavalry, initiated an ill-advised attack on the entrenched Federal garrison at Munfordville, Ky. Hoping to secure an easy victory, Chalmers had also heard that Munfordville contained large stores of wheat. Worried that the repulse would undermine Confederate sentiments in the Bluegrass State, Bragg veered his entire force to Munfordville and compelled the garrison to surrender. 
But the delay allowed Buell to draw near. Briefly Bragg considered making a stand against Buell there, but instead returned to the march. Real hunger now appeared: Buell's men complained that they were reduced to half-rations, then quarter-rations, and when the hardtack they brought with them finally ran out, received only wormy flour without the necessary utensils to make bread. 
On Sept. 22 Confederate forces halted at Bardstown, in the middle of the state, disappointing many Johnny Rebs who had assumed they were hurrying to take Louisville. Buell's exhausted men began arriving in that city on Sept. 25, furious that their commander had allowed Bragg to come so far north without a fight. Indicative of the soldiers' collapsing morale, wild rumors circulated that the two generals actually were brothers-in-law who slept together nightly while making plans for another day's nonviolent marching. Some Hoosier troops were in fact so angry that they deserted by walking home across the drought-ravaged Ohio River. 
On Oct. 1, augmented by new recruits, Buell marched his army out of Louisville, determined to drive Bragg's smaller army from the state. Again, the water crisis stymied the two armies. By Oct. 7, at least one corps in the Federal army was so dehydrated and so sick from pond-borne bacteria that it lurched into camp at the point of collapse and mutiny. Before dawn the next morning, other elements of Buell's army moved forward in the darkness, determined to drive Confederates away from the precious springs of water they zealously safeguarded. 
So opened the Battle of Perryville, Kentucky's largest battle, fought in the dusty hills just west of a town where the Chaplin River had all but run dry. Gaining a tactical victory, Bragg decided to retreat to Tennessee when he finally realized that he faced a numerically superior force, and he abandoned Kentucky entirely upon learning that his planned supply base was all but empty. 
The drought that turned the war in the West would continue for another two years.

HEADLINE: Bless the Crass Chinese Tourist

BYLINE: CLARISSA SEBAG-MONTEFIORE


HIGHLIGHT: Chinese tourists may be loud, and they may prefer shopping to sightseeing. But in these troubled economic times, that's hardly a bad thing. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - On Monday, I boarded a plane from Rome to Beijing packed with Chinese tour groups returning from their Golden Week vacations in Europe. After sun-drenched, insouciant Italy, the rowdy cabin was a shock.
Turning to a Chinese tour guide on my right, I asked whether his charges had enjoyed Rome's grand churches. "Churches?" he repeated, surprised. He pointed to overflowing duty-free bags around us. "Trust me, they don't like churches. They only want to shop!" On a brief visit to Paris earlier on the trip, the group had spent over four hours at Galeries Lafayette, the famous department store.
In 2011, 70 million Chinese traveled abroad, and the World Tourism Organization estimates that the figure will surge to 100 million by 2020. Nine of the 10 hottest destinations were within Asia (the United States was the exception), topped by Hong Kong, according to the China Tourism Academy. Chinese spent $47 billion on their bank cardsabroad in 2011 - two-thirds more than the previous year. In Europe, hotels, luxury shops and department stores are hiring staff who speak Mandarin to lure in Chinese customers.
One place those visitors won't be staying, however, is the new boutique hotel by Thierry Gillier, the founder of the fashion house Zadig & Voltaire. Last week Gillier made an international faux pas when he said in an interview to Women's Wear Daily that his hotel, due to launch in 2014, "won't be open to Chinese tourists." He wants to privilege guests looking for "quiet with a certain privacy."
He has since apologized, and the Web site of Women's Wear Daily apparently changed his reference to"Chinese tourists" to read "busloads of tourists." But Gillier's comment had already hit a nerve.
Chinese tourists were voted the second-worst behaved in the world, after Americans, in a recent LivingSocial survey of five countries, including the United States. Stereotypes of vulgarity - like spitting in the street and a preference for shopping over sightseeing - make Chinese tourists appear to many old-school Europeans like the worst kind of nouveau riche, the new face of mass tourism.
Back home, the Chinese are both worried about how they are being perceived abroad and angry at the old world's snobbism. One article for China Newsweek, which states that the Chinese leave an impression of "rowdy tourist hordes who just shop like crazy," has been widely forwarded online.
Learning how to travel with sensitivity toward local customs and interest for local sights takes time, however. "Impulse buying is still common and sometimes the main purpose for the trip," explained Laurence Lee, the tour guide I met on the Rome-Beijing flight. But, he added, "compared with 15 years ago, Chinese tourists' behavior has improved."
Vacationing abroad is taken for granted in much of the developed world, but in China, which only opened up to the outside three decades ago, traveling for pleasure is still a novelty for many.
One such person is my next-door neighbor, who has spent most of his 60-plus years in Beijing's old hutong alleyways. A retired army man, he lives in a cramped courtyard without heating or plumbing; he has to use the local public toilet (he doesn't want me to reveal his name). This year he left China for the first time on a cheap package tour to Taipei, a trip he recalls with relish. Such a journey would have been unimaginable even a decade ago.
The Chinese middle classes who are traveling en masse for the first time beyond their borders should be celebrated, not derided. Their newfound mobility is a boon to failing economies, especially in Europe.
Last year, over900,000 Chinese tourists visited France alone, and the number is predicted to quadruple in the next decade. The British government is considering easing visa restrictions and increasing direct flights in the hope of trebling the number of Chinese tourists to Britain in just three years.
Chinese tourists may be loud. And they may prefer splashing their cash on Chanel to visiting cathedrals. But in these troubled economic times, that's hardly a bad thing.

HEADLINE: Europe Told to Count Its Blessings

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Europe may be enduring its worst crisis in decades, but it should not overlook its contribution to peace and democracy, according to the Nobel Peace Prize committee. Awarding its 2012 prize to the European Union, it warned against a rise in extremism on the Continent that could set the clock back. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Europe was on Friday invited to count its blessings, set its present difficulties aside, and celebrate a legacy of six decades of democracy and peace.
Despite the "grave economic difficulties" facing the Continent, the Nobel Peace Prize committee decided the 27-member European Union deserved recognition for its long-term contribution to peace since its foundation after World War II.
With governments fighting to tackle a chronic debt crisis and industrial decline, it would seem an odd time to celebrate an institution whose popularity might understandably be waning among its 500 million recession-hit citizens.
Perhaps that was the point. The Norwegian-based committee, mindful of the growth of extremism and nationalism in an era of austerity, evidently decided it was the right moment to remind Europeans what they had achieved.
"The European Union is in the middle of one of its worst crises, but perhaps it is precisely now that the peace and stabilization project deserves a hand from the 'no' country Norway," said the Norwegian state broadcaster NRK, referring to the fact that the country's voters long ago passed up the chance to join the E.U.
The European Union has for "six decades contributed to the advancement of peace, reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe," according to the prize-givers.
2012 #NobelPeacePrize "for over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace & reconciliation, democracy &human rights in Europe."
- Nobelprize_org (@Nobelprize_org) October 12, 2012
That included an end to the historic antipathy between Germany and France, the two mainland Continental giants, and the embrace of former Eastern bloc nations after the fall of the Berlin wall.
Nobel Peace Prize day is as good a time as any to examine the proposition that the world has never been as peaceful as it is today.
Two partisans of the thesis, Joshua S. Goldstein and Steven Pinker, acknowledged in an opinion article in the Sunday Review last December that the idea that war was obsolescent might seem preposterously utopian.
 "Aren't we facing an endless war on terror, a clash of civilizations, the menace of nuclear rogue states? Isn't war in our genes, something that will always be with us?" they asked.
The evidence, they said, suggested otherwise. 
Mr. Pinker, a Harvard psychologist, and Mr. Goldstein, an American University international relations expert, argued that the modern prevalence of images of war could be misleading. Wars between states were increasingly rare and civil wars were fewer, smaller and more localized.
Their assessment was echoed by Geir Lundestad, the head of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, who said ahead of Friday's prize announcement: "The long term trend is that the world is indeed getting more peaceful."
This year's Global Peace Index from the Institute for Economics and Peace found that the world had improved in peacefulness for the first time since 2009, a modest indicator since the index has only been running for six years.
At the top of the rankings, as if to underline the Nobel committee's choice, were the countries of Europe. The survey found that Western Europe remained markedly the most peaceful region in the world, with the majority of its countries ranking in the global top 20.
That record may be at risk, however, as the impoverishment of countries such as Greece spurs high levels of protests, anti-immigration extremism and violent crime.
It was a reminder of what could happen if the Continent began to disintegrate, according to Thorbjorn Jagland, the prize committee chairman. Hence his exhortation that "we should do everything we can to secure what we have achieved and move forward."

HEADLINE: How a Green Fuel Turned Slimy

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Some start-ups found loopholes in a program that allowed refiners to meet biodiesel quotas by purchasing credits. 

 BODY:
How did the oil industry and the Environmental Protection Agency end up with a system for tracking the production of biodiesel that was vulnerable to fraud? 
As I report in The Times, the agency is working on new rules to rescue the program after a yet-to-be-determined number of swindlers manufactured more than100 million credits tied to the manufacture of biodiesel that did not actually exist. This was possible, it appears, because the structure of the market for "RINs," or renewable identification numbers, is fundamentally different from the market for other kinds of credits, like those issued for reducing sulfur dioxide emissions or lead pollution. 
The biggest credit-trading scheme now running is probably the one for sulfur dioxide, a pollutant emitted mostly by power plants that causes acid rain. The idea behind the credit system, known as cap and trade, is that if the government sets an overall limit for emissions, it can minimize costs by letting the market figure out who can most cheaply achieve the reductions. 
Let's say that two power plants have to cut such emissions by 50 percent. One power plant can eliminate one ton of emissions for $30 and its neighbor can do it for $50. So the first plant achieves the entire reduction required of the two of them, and sells credits to the second plant at a price that is greater than its cost but less than the second plant would have had to spend. 
Likewise, in the days when the government was ordering lead removed from gasoline, one refinery could "over-control" its cuts and sell credits to another. Companies that achieved the required reductions before they were required to could "bank" the credits and use them later, or sell them. 
The number of power plants and oil refineries is relatively small because big plants have economic advantages over small ones. And they are mostly owned by large, well-established companies. So it is relatively easy to keep track of the players. 
What is more, power plants and refineries are already required to keep a variety of other kinds of records that an auditor can use to determine if the reduction claims are plausible, like how many tons of coal a plant burned or how many gallons of gasoline it produced. 
By contrast, the biodiesel producers tend to be smaller because their raw materials - animal fats collected from restaurants or slaughterhouses, oil from soybeans - are usually collected from many small sources and it is not economically feasible to haul them very far. 
So the multiplicity of small producers in scattered places created an opening for fraud. The big cases so far have been involved start-ups, or, more accurately, pretend start-ups. 
 "It doesn't make sense for a trader in White Plains, N.Y., to go to West Texas to determine whether this person is creating biodiesel,'' explained Eric A. Rubury, the chief executive of OceanConnect, a firm in White Plains that specialized in trading in RINs. It was easier to create a system of credits that was "like a currency,'' that could be moved around easily. 
Mr. Rubury described the fraud as "a tragedy." 
"It was a decent program,'' he said. "Biofuel was being produced, technologies were being improved, and companies were getting patents. In a world where people complain about whether a program works, it worked.''
The program is still operating, but the refiners, which are obligated to buy the RINs to meet their quotas, are now often bypassing small little-known producers now or offering to buy credits from them only at a discount. So many legitimate small start-ups are suffering.

HEADLINE: Daily Report: Panetta Warns of Threat of Cyberattack on U.S.

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned Thursday that the United States was facing the possibility of a "cyber-Pearl Harbor" and was increasingly vulnerable to foreign computer hackers who could dismantle the nation's power grid, transportation system, financial networks and government, report Elisabeth Bumiller and Thom Shanker in Friday's New York Times. 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned Thursday that the United States was facing the possibility of a "cyber-Pearl Harbor" and was increasingly vulnerable to foreign computer hackers who could dismantle the nation's power grid, transportation system, financial networks and government, report Elisabeth Bumiller and Thom Shanker in Friday's New York Times.
In a speech at the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum on the Hudson River in New York, Mr. Panetta painted a dire picture of how such an attack on the United States might unfold. He said he was reacting to increasing aggressiveness and technological advances by the nation's adversaries, which officials identified as China, Russia, Iran and militant groups.
"An aggressor nation or extremist group could gain control of critical switches and derail passenger trains, or trains loaded with lethal chemicals," Mr. Panetta said. "They could contaminate the water supply in major cities, or shut down the power grid across large parts of the country."
Defense officials said Mr. Panetta was responding to a recent wave of cyberattacks on large American financial institutions. He also cited an attack in August on the state oil company Saudi Aramco, which infected and made useless more than 30,000 computers.
But Pentagon officials acknowledged that Mr. Panetta was also pushing for legislation on Capitol Hill. That legislation would require new standards at critical private-sector infrastructure facilities - like power plants, water treatment facilities and gas pipelines - where a computer breach could cause significant casualties or economic damage.
Mr. Panetta's comments, his most extensive to date on cyberwarfare, also sought to increase the level of public debate about the Defense Department's growing capacity not only to defend but also to carry out attacks over computer networks. Even so, he carefully avoided using the words "offense" or "offensive" in the context of American cyberwarfare, instead defining the Pentagon's capabilities as "action to defend the nation."

HEADLINE: Mortgage Lending Helps JPMorgan Profit Rise 34%

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: JPMorgan Chase posted earnings of $5.7 billion, up from $4.3 billion, as the bank showed signs of strength in consumer and corporate lending. 

 BODY:
Finally moving beyond a trading debacle that has stained his once-stellar reputation, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, on Friday trumpeted a strong quarter of earnings stemming from a surge in mortgage lending.
Mr. Dimon has been fighting to shift attention from a multibillion-dollar trading loss in May that rattled investors, prompted the bank to claw back millions in compensation and attracted the scrutiny of federal law enforcement agents. The latest quarter's profit, up 34 percent, to $5.71 billion, helped do that.
Mr. Dimon, who months ago took a swaggering tone in dismissing the troubled bets and was later forced to be more contrite, struck his usual confident tone on Friday. He emphasized that JPMorgan had contained the fallout from the bungled trade, after closing out the position and limiting the losses to the investment bank on the remainder of the credit derivative trade. The losses on the bet were $449 million in the third quarter, bringing the total loss to $6.25 billion for the year.
"Synthetic credit is a sideshow," Mr. Dimon said.
Instead, he pointed to the bank's robust growth across its business units, especially in its mortgage banking unit, which reported a profit increase of 57 percent from a year earlier.
"We believe the housing market has turned the corner," Mr. Dimon said.
Over all, the company's earnings, at $1.40 a share, surpassed Wall Street's estimates. Revenue in the third quarter was $25.9 billion, up 6 percent from the year-ago quarter.
As the nation's largest bank in assets, JPMorgan's performance, especially when rosy, is seized upon as a positive sign for the overall economy. The growth at JPMorgan, particularly in loans to consumers and businesses, could signal broader optimism among Americans and bode well for the housing markets, which have been lurching toward recovery.
"It's a distinctly positive sign," said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Nomura Securities.
The bank also reported that fewer consumers were behind on their credit card bills. Write-offs of soured card loans fell to 3.6 percent, from 4.7 percent the previous year. Those trends echo a pattern across the United States.
In August, delinquencies on credit cards stood at 2.32 percent, according to Moody's Investors Service. That's down from 3.04 a year earlier.
Still, investors in bank stocks remained wary after the earnings announcements of JPMorgan and Wells Fargo on Friday. Shares of JPMorgan declined 48 cents, or 1.14 percent, to $41.62. Investors were spooked, in part, by shrinking net interest margins, which is the profit margin achieved from lending and investing. JPMorgan's net interest margin, for example, dipped to 2.43 percent from 2.66 a year earlier.
At JPMorgan, a glut of deposits is challenging because of persistently low interest rates, which make yields on the bank's investments anemic.
JPMorgan's earnings were buoyed, though, by an increase in mortgage lending, spurred, in part, by exceedingly low interest rates, driven even lower in recent weeks by the Federal Reserve's mortgage bond buying program. New home loans and refinancings at the bank hit $47 billion, up 29 percent from the period a year earlier.
Mr. Dimon tempered his expectations for the market and noted that a large swath of the new originations came from a burst of refinancing activity that would eventually slow down. Refinancings accounted for roughly 75 percent of the quarter's mortgage volume.
He warned, too, that defaults could continue, along with foreclosures, which would most likely leave the bank to shoulder higher costs.
Hitting a familiar tone, Mr. Dimon also remarked that the housing market could rebound more quickly if lawmakers in Washington did less meddling. "I would hope for America's sake we start to fix the things that make the mortgage underwriting too tight," he said on a conference call with reporters.
Throughout its core lending businesses, JPMorgan showed signs of strength. The commercial banking group reported record revenue. The volume of credit card sales jumped 11 percent over the previous year, bolstering the broader unit. The card services and auto business posted profits of $954 million, up 12 percent.
With the improving credit environment, JPMorgan set aside less money to cover potential losses, increasing its profits. In the mortgage banking business, the bank cut the amount of reserves by $900 million. Across the bank, JPMorgan set aside $1.79 billion of such funds, compared with $2.41 billion a year earlier.
Revenue from fixed-income and equity markets remained largely stagnant.
Still, the bank is dogged by investigations that could increase its headaches going forward. In the latest challenge for the bank, federal authorities are building criminal cases related to the trading loss, examining calls in which JPMorgan employees talked about how to value the bets. The Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating the trading losses.
In addition, JPMorgan is facing a lawsuit against Bear Stearns, the troubled unit it now owns. Earlier this month in its first move against a big bank, the federal mortgage task force, co-headed by the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, sued Bear Stearns and its lending unit, claiming it defrauded investors who bought mortgage securities during the housing boom.
In a bid to clean up the bungled trade ahead of its third-quarter earnings, JPMorgan has broadly reshuffled its top executive ranks. For example, Douglas L. Braunstein, the bank's chief financial officer since 2010, is expected to give up his position, but remain at the company. Earlier, Barry Zubrow, who currently heads the bank's regulatory affairs, announced he would resign by the end of the year.
In the second quarter, the bank transferred the remaining credit bets in the chief investment office to its investment banking unit. On Friday, JPMorgan said it "effectively closed" out its derivative position, which was made by Bruno Iksil, the so-called London Whale.

HEADLINE: Earnings at Wells Fargo Jump 22%

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The bank reported $4.9 billion in profit for the third quarter, mostly because of a big increase in its mortgage business. 

 BODY:
 5:42 p.m. | Updated 
At the height of the financial crisis, the mortgage business was a millstone for the banking industry. Today, it is a profit center.
Wells Fargo on Friday reported $4.9 billion in profit for the third quarter, a 22 percent jump largely led by a booming mortgage business.
The bank, based in San Francisco, continues to churn out record profit, having reported 11 straight quarters of gains in net income. The results of 88 cents a share narrowly beat the estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, who forecast earnings of 87 cents a share.
The bank's revenue increased as well, sidestepping a common sore spot that has plagued most all of the nation's biggest banks. Wells Fargo recorded $21.2 billion in revenue, which surpassed the $19.6 billion figure from a year earlier but was slightly below expectations.
The bank's lending division led the growth, as consumers refinanced their mortgages to take advantage of record low interest rates. Wells Fargo, the nation's largest mortgage lender, snared $188 billion in home mortgage applications, an 11 percent jump from the third quarter of 2011.
The bank's chief financial officer, Timothy J. Sloan, underscored that "it's more than just the mortgage business." The strong results, he noted, were spread across the bank. The wealth management unit improved. So did the sales and trading business.
"We just have the great benefit of this diversified model," Mr. Sloan said in an interview.
But investors were not fully impressed. On Friday, the bank's shares closed down 2.6 percent to $34.25, reflecting concern about net interest margin, an important measure of the income the bank makes on its assets. The measure declined in part because the bank's own investments suffered from an environment of low-interest rates.
Wells Fargo, along with JPMorgan Chase, began the bank earnings season on Friday. The nation's other big banks, including Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, will report their results next week.
The Wells Fargo story line - that a deep lending effort breeds success - is rooted in broad federal stimulus efforts that have propped up the mortgage industry. An initiative by the Treasury Department is spurring refinancings. And the Federal Reserve has introduced a long-term plan to buy large batches of mortgage-backed bonds, which should help keep rates low.
Wells Fargo, more than five years after the mortgage crisis, has seized the opportunity. The bank now creates roughly a third of all mortgages in the country. Total outstanding loans jumped slightly in the third quarter to $783 billion while the bank's home mortgage originations soared 56 percent to $139 billion.
The demand for credit came largely from refinancing, which accounted for 72 percent of all home loan applications. The Treasury program produced 14 percent of the mortgage volume.
Like other big banks, Wells Fargo makes home loans before selling most of them to investors after attaching a government guarantee. Those gains totaled $2.61 billion in the third quarter, up 225 percent from $803 million in the third quarter of last year.
The refinancing boom is fueling profits. Wells Fargo's profit in the community banking division, which includes Wells Fargo's retail branches and mortgage business, climbed 18 percent to $2.7 billion.
Despite the gains, the mortgage crisis continues to haunt Wells Fargo. The bank this summer agreed to pay $175 million to settle Justice Department accusations that it discriminated against certain minority homeowners from 2004 to 2009. Wells Fargo, which denied the charges, was also sued this week by federal prosecutors in New York, who claim the bank defrauded the government and lied about the quality of the mortgages it handled under a federal housing program.
Still, the legal troubles will barely nick the bank's bottom line.
Like JPMorgan, Wells is having growth beyond mortgages. Wholesale banking, which includes the sales and trading business along with the corporate lending division, increased its profit by 11 percent, to $1.9 billion. While the unit operates in the shadow of the Wall Street investment banks, Wells Fargo has gradually extended its reach in that area.
"There are a lot of underlying positives that will continue to drive the earnings of this company," said Edward R. Najarian, a senior bank analyst at ISI, a New York research firm.
 Peter Eavis contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: Week in Review: What Criminal Case? Inside JPMorgan's Rising Profit

BYLINE: ERIC OWLES


HIGHLIGHT: For JPMorgan, a criminal case is being built on taped calls, but earnings are still rising. | Drawing back a curtain on a Mexican tycoon. | Andrew Ross Sorkin said France was welcoming back higher taxes, but not that high. | Ireland plans bold measures to lift housing. A look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance. 

 BODY:
 He may no longer be America's least-hated banker, but Jamie Dimon still has the hearts of JPMorgan's investors.
While federal authorities are building criminal cases related to JPMorgan's $6 billion trading loss, the bank's chief issued a release on Friday praising the "continued momentum in all our businesses." The nation's largest bank reported a third-quarter profit of $5.7 billion, up 34 percent from a year ago.
Investigators are scrutinizing phone calls of employees discussing the best way to value trouble bets. Although the bank has rearranged the roles of several executives, DealBook's Ben Protess and Azam Ahmed report that the inquiry does not appear to include the bank's upper ranks. "The scope of the inquiry suggests that the problems were isolated to a handful of executives and traders in an overseas division, and did not reflect a fundamental weakness with the bank's culture and leadership," The New York Times reported this week.
Not many executives could survive a multibillion-dollar loss. Even fewer companies could respond with multibillion-dollar earnings. And as long as the investigation steers clear of Mr. Dimon he should be free to continue needling his old friends in Washington for fewer regulations.

HEADLINE: Blaming Regulation, Again, for Restricting Mortgage Lending

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Regulatory uncertainty does weigh on banks' ability and desire to make loans. But here are some counterweights to complaints by bankers that new rules are deterring them from making more mortgage loans to consumers. 

 BODY:
 4:03 p.m. | Updated 
It's the government's fault - or so the bankers say.
Despite the multiyear federal stimulus that is still being thrown at the mortgage market, some banking executives are saying that Washington is acting in ways that are holding back a housing recovery. 
The latest person to pile on was Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, who said Friday: "I would hope for America's sake we start to fix the things that make the mortgage underwriting too tight." The inference was that new regulation is getting in the way, especially the lack of clarity on proposed rules that aim to make mortgages fair and affordable for borrowers. 
Regulatory uncertainty does of course weigh on banks' ability and desire to make loans. But here are some counterweights to such complaints. 
 First, government support to the housing market far outweighs any negative impact for banks. The mortgage market is benefiting from three huge sources of stimulus and subsidy. The Federal Reserve has purchased hundreds of billions of dollars of mortgage-backed bonds since the crisis, an initiative that lowers interest rates and ignites demand for new loans among borrowers. Government-owned entities like Fannie Mae currently guarantee repayment on nearly all mortgages. And the Treasury Department's homeowner relief programs have generated refinancing income for banks. 
All this aid has made it possible for banks like JPMorgan to carry out one of the most profitable, low-risk "trades" that has ever existed in modern capital markets. They simply make mortgages and flip them to bond investors, after attaching the federal guarantee. In the third quarter, JPMorgan booked $1.78 billion in revenue from that type of transaction, a 36 percent increase from the year-earlier period. 
Second, bankers may be overstating the amount of regulatory uncertainty that hangs over the mortgage market. 
Mr. Dimon said that mortgage underwriting was "too tight." It is true that nearly all mortgages made these days have to be underwritten very safely - lots of money down, and much verifying information, for example - to qualify for the federal guarantee. 
Still, banks are absolutely free to make mortgages with looser standards and then hold them on their balance sheet instead of selling them in the bond market. Banks, however, say they are reluctant to do that, in part because of regulatory uncertainty. For one, they say new capital rules could make it more expensive to hold certain types of mortgages, though the details here are getting much clearer.
Then there is the crucial question of what will constitute a "qualified residential mortgage," a classification created by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul. Under Dodd-Frank, banks have to retain a set amount of exposure to mortgages if they're in the business of selling them to bond investors. But that rule won't apply to the "qualified residential mortgages," giving banks the freedom to hold as many as they want.
The argument goes: Until the banks know what a qualified residential mortgage is, they will stick to making loans that can be affixed with a government guarantee. The problem with this criticism is that the majority of mortgage loans written since the financial crisis likely fulfilled the proposed requirements. For instance, a Government Accountability Office study last year showed that the majority of mortgages made in 2010 would have fulfilled the proposed requirements. However, a study by a federal housing regulator showed that just under a third of 2009 mortgages would have passed all criteria.
But debating the effect of all these various mortgage rules misses an important point: Banks like JPMorgan are currently willing to hold all sorts of assets that face regulatory uncertainty, some of them arguably riskier and harder to quickly sell than residential mortgages. One such asset is credit-default swaps, which led to large trading losses earlier this year at JPMorgan. The bank is still a huge player in that market, despite a range of new rules that are still being drawn up. 
So perhaps the protests over regulation mask other concerns. For banks, one obvious deterrent to holding mortgages is low interest rates - rates that are so low that banks cannot make enough money on the interest to make up for the risks of holding them.
It's sensible for banks to think twice before holding onto long-term assets with low, fixed interest rates - like the mortgages people are getting these days. But if that's the major reason they're not holding on to mortgages, banks should just come out and say that.
An earlier version of this article misstated a term used in a rule that governs whether a bank must retain a certain amount of mortgages it originates. The term is qualified residential mortgages, not qualified mortgages. The General Accountability Office study did look at the financial overhaul's impact on both qualified mortgages and qualified residential mortgages, finding that the majority of qualified residential mortgages made in 2010 would have fulfilled the proposed requirements.

HEADLINE: Oct. 12: Romney Debate Gains Show Staying Power

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney on Friday may have featured his best set of polls all year. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney continues to surge in the FiveThirtyEight forecast, and Friday may have featured his best set of polls all year.
The best way to track a change in the polls is to look for instances in which the same firm has surveyed the same state (or the national race) multiple times. The FiveThirtyEight forecast model relies on a procedure very much like this to calculate the overall trend in the race.
Fifteen polls were released on Friday that provided a comparison with another survey conducted between the Democratic convention and last week's debate in Denver. Mr. Romney gained an average of 4.6 percentage points in these surveys.
That is actually a bit larger than we were showing earlier in the week, when the same exercise put Mr. Romney's postdebate bounce more in the range of three or four percentage points. 
It is not clear whether Mr. Romney is still gaining ground -- or whether he benefited from a couple of outlying results. The median change in the polls, which will be less sensitive to potential outliers, was a three-point gain for Mr. Romney, more like earlier in the week.
But unlike earlier, Mr. Romney is now seeing some of his best results in swing state polls. Six of the seven polls published on Friday from such states had him ahead. 
Thus, just as the hypothesis of a fading Romney bounce was damaged on Friday, so was the idea (which we critiqued in an earlier post) that his gains would be more modest in the swing states.
It might be noted that some of the state polls released on Friday were from firms that have had Republican-leaning results, and they might slightly exaggerate his standing. It is unlikely, for instance, that Mr. Romney would win New Hampshire by four percentage points right now, as implied by an American Research Group poll of the state.
But even polls that are Republican- or Democratic-leaning can still be useful in detecting the race's trend, and it is one that clearly favors Mr. Romney. 
Because our forecasts are made on a probabilistic spectrum, we do not place a major emphasis on the idea of "calling" states, but Mr. Romney's probability of winning Florida crossed the 50 percent threshold earlier this week. He got two more strong polls there on Friday, bringing his chances to nearly two in three.
Mr. Romney became the slight favorite in Colorado in the forecast on Thursday, and the slight favorite in Virginia with Friday's update.
The forecast model is being very aggressive about pricing in Mr. Romney's gains. In our "now-cast," he's added a net of 4.8 percentage points since the debate. He will need to have more strong polling days like Friday to maintain his current standing in the model.
But the FiveThirtyEight forecast of Mr. Romney's chances -- 38.9 percent -- is nearly identical to the one at the betting market Intrade, which put them at 38.5 percent as of early Friday evening.
Other prediction markets and bookmakers give Mr. Romney slightly lower chances, in the range of 30 or 35 percent.
Were there any bright spots at all for President Obama in Friday's data? He did gain ground in two national tracking polls, from Ipsos and Investor's Business Daily, although he lost ground in two others, from Gallup and Rasmussen Reports.
The Ipsos poll is interesting in that it was the only one to include a substantive number of interviews after the vice-presidential debate on Thursday night. (Ipsos conducts some of its online sampling late in the evening and early the next morning.) That poll showed Mr. Romney's national lead narrowing to one point from three. 
Still, the clear majority of its interviews preceded the vice-presidential debate. It will take a couple of days to determine whether it had any impact on the polls. 
The only really good news for Democrats is that Mr. Obama had built up a large enough cushion that he could withstand a lot of damage without becoming the underdog. The forecast model still has him clinging to narrow leads in Ohio, Iowa, Wisconsin and Nevada, states that in some combination would give him 270 electoral votes.
Mr. Obama may also be just slightly underperforming the fundamentals in the election. His approval ratings remain near 50 percent, which would ordinarily predict a narrow re-election victory. 
Some of the more visible economic numbers, like monthly and weekly jobs reports and consumer confidence figures, have also been stronger lately.
None of this is to say that a rebound is certain. It is late enough in the race that the polls need to be taken more at face value. 
The forecast model adjusts Mr. Obama's numbers up slightly based on its economic index and his incumbency status, but only by about 0.4 percentage points.
It may also be that he will need to earn those lost points back -- rather than expecting them to return automatically -- with, for example, a stronger performance in the last two presidential debates. 
In the same way that Mr. Romney had a wind at his back before the Denver debate, in that the four- or five-point lead that Mr. Obama held at that point was higher than might be expected based on economic conditions, Mr. Obama might have more to gain than to lose in the final two events.
Yet some of the plausible arguments that Democrats were making earlier in the week about Mr. Obama's standing -- like that his position would be more robust in the swing states -- are looking weaker now.
Although we prefer to describe the race in quantitative rather than qualitative terms, the nomenclature that we use in our Senate forecasts is to describe a race as a "tossup" if each candidate has at least a 40 percent chance of winning. Mr. Romney is on the verge of that threshold.

HEADLINE: How Can a Stay-at-Home Mom Get Back to Work?

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: I think Yahoo's Marisa Mayer was fortunate to understand what I did not grasp 10 years ago - that if she chose to step away from her career to have a child, she might never get it back. 

 BODY:
 A fellow mother and law-school graduate sent me this quandary. I feel her intense frustration in her words, which I take not as a judgment of others, but of herself and her own particular choice. Does anyone have advice about how to restart a career in an economy that is particularly punishing for those who voluntarily pulled the plug, or how to cope with the feeling of having sabotaged yourself, as you search for a way to make it all work out?
 I WANT TO GO BACK TO WORK 
By JENNIFER ROMANIUK
The tendrils of panic take hold as the school bus rumbles away. I try to shrug it off, but day after day it gets closer to pulling me under. I'm not worried about my children heading off into the world without me. They are frustratingly independent and thrive at school. My worry stems from the empty desk in my home office. What am I going to do today? Still fighting off the panic - how did this happen? - I put on my shoes, shove headphones in my ears and run.
Like many Americans today, I am underemployed. But unlike many, I voluntarily walked away from a promising career (somewhat) almost a decade ago. I had no idea how long it would take to claw my way back. I am a lawyer and for several years held a coveted job with a large law firm in the Midwest. It was the kind of job where the compensation was high and the expectations higher. And I loved it. 
But soon after returning to work following the birth of my second child, I had to face a stark reality. My husband's career as a partner in the same firm had skyrocketed. His travel rendered me a single mother many nights, which I could manage with one elementary school age child and a career. But now I had two child care clocks to beat. There were two grumpy, hungry children to feed, bathe and put to bed after a long day. Even a "reduced billable hour" schedule (available but not yet truly accepted at my firm) seemed daunting. And of course, there is the subtle societal pressure. Successful husband plus multiple children equals stay-at-home mom, right? And think of all of the fun I could have volunteering at my older child's school. So I walked away.
Unfortunately, I soon realized that I would rather extract my eyeballs with a teaspoon than plan a school fund-raiser or decorate a first-grade classroom billboard. I am bracing for the hateful comments, but I'm going to just lay it out there. I love my children, but my children are not enough. I need more. More important, I want my children to need more. I believe working mothers help foster that elusive sense of independence that seems to be lacking in so many kids today. 
I cringe at the criticism of women like Yahoo's chief executive, Marissa Mayer, who have the audacity to embark on motherhood while maintaining a demanding career. I think Ms. Mayer was fortunate to understand what I did not grasp 10 years ago - that if she chose to step away from her career, she might never get it back. 
I returned to work part time three years ago with the idea that by the time my third child started school, I would be ready to pick up where I left off. And I am ready. But what I didn't count on was the abysmal job market, not to mention that I am now "overqualified" for entry-level positions yet not desirable as a senior associate because I do not have a large book of business. There is not enough work in my specialty area at my current firm to support me full time. So here I sit at an empty desk in my home office, wondering what I should do next.
I know I am not the only mom who has faced these issues. I'd like to hear from others and see how they cope, or how they choreographed an escape back to their careers. In the meantime, you can find me pounding the suburban sidewalks trying to ease the panic that my career may have peaked before it really began.

HEADLINE: Assessing the Value of Medicaid to Its Enrollees

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: A change in the approach to valuing benefits as part of a family&#8217;s or individual&#8217;s income may have significant effects in defining who is impoverished, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
Medicaid is a huge government health-insurance program administered by the states within federal guidelines, with many of its costs paid for by the federal government. 
The program provides comprehensive, first-dollar coverage to 56 million Americans and supplemental (wrap-around) insurance to another six million poor, elderly Americans who are also covered by Medicare for most of their acute care (the "dual eligibles"). 
In 2009, the program spent $375 billion, of which close to $350 billion was spent directly on health care for these beneficiaries. The federal government covered 57 percent of total spending and state governments the rest. On average, this comes to about $5,500 per beneficiary, but that average is highly misleading.

The chart below presents a clearer breakdown of spending by risk class. 
A question that has vexed economists and government statisticians for decades is how the benefits represented by Medicaid coverage - or the receipt of any benefit in kind - should be treated when estimating a household's position in national income distribution. 
Consider two otherwise identical families, A and B, with the same money income. Family A is granted a government-financed benefit in kind (e.g., Medicaid coverage). Family B is not granted that benefit. It either does not have it, or it has purchased the benefit with its own money income. 
Should we judge these two families equally "well off" because their money income is identical? Should their position in the nation's income distribution be the same? The sensible answer is no. 
But for government statisticians tasked with estimating family incomes, the next question is: in dollar terms, exactly how much richer than Family B is Family A? It is this question that has troubled economists and government statisticians alike.
In a thought-provoking column, "Health Care as Income to the Poor," The New York Times columnist Eduardo Porter recently revisited this question, stimulated by a report published in July by the Congressional Budget Office, "The Distribution of Household Income and Federal Taxes, 2008 and 2009."
In that report, the C.B.O. for the first time imputes to Medicaid recipients as "income" the full average cost to the government of providing Medicaid insurance, measured by average expenditures per beneficiary, broken down by state and by risk class. A similar approach has long been used to impute to the income of employed Americans the value of employer-paid health-insurance premiums (see Footnote 17 in the C.B.O. report).
Previously, the C.B.O. had imputed to Medicaid recipients only the so-called fungible value of that coverage, as it has for years been calculated by the Census Bureau. That imputed value is never higher than the value now used by the C.B.O., and for many very low-income families it is much lower or even zero.
The "fungible value" of Medicaid coverage is calculated as the smaller of (1) what it costs taxpayers to provide the coverage or (2) the difference between the household's money income and the amount it needs to cover its basic needs of food and housing. If the household does not have enough money for food and housing, then the fungible value of Medicaid coverage is assumed to be zero. (For more detail, see Footnote 2 in this Census Bureau guide, where "household income" is defined no less than 15 different ways).
The C.B.O.'s new approach is not without controversy, as it can easily move families previously classified as below the federal poverty line above that line. It changes the picture of poverty in this country, and it could affect eligibility thresholds for other public programs. One could, of course, use alternative, more suitable definitions of "income" for specific purposes.
Opponents to imputing any income for Medicaid coverage to their recipients might come up with the following stories.
Suppose a state government kindly raised the fees that Medicaid pays physicians by, say, 10 percent. This would inject millions and possibly billions of additional dollars into the bank accounts of physicians, who typically reside in the top fifth percentile of the distribution of family incomes, with quite a few in the top 1 percent.
At the same time, however, the fee-increase would instantly lift many poor families from below to above the federal poverty line, without their having a penny more to spend. One can image this puzzling headline in the daily press: "Governor Reduces Poverty by Paying Physicians More."
Consider next two individuals, A and B, with the same money income. Individual A is a poor but healthy adult; Individual B is poor and severely disabled. The table above shows the average Medicaid expenditure on these two risk classes in 2009. After adding to their (identical) money incomes the imputed, risk-based value of Medicaid coverage, severely disabled Individual B appears to be much richer than Individual A. Do we really think Individual B is better off than Individual A?
At the theoretical level, economists use one of two approaches to valuing benefits in kind from the recipient's perspective. 
The standard approach is to define the value of a benefit in kind to recipients as the maximum they would pay for it out of their own money income. That imputed value, of course, would depend in part on the recipient's money income. As I remarked in , most economists have no problem with that, but the public might. 
An alternative is to use an approach I explored in a related post, here amplified by my lecture notes to students. Suppose we gave a hypothetical recipient not the benefit in kind but the cash it costs taxpayers to provide the benefit. How much of that cash would that recipient then spend on the benefit? Perhaps even more, in case of insurance? Whatever the case may be, we would use that amount as the value imputed to the benefit. That imputed value, of course, would partly depend on the recipient's money income as well.
The bottom line is this. Economists really do not have a robust solution to this conundrum, one that can be carried out and that stands beyond dispute. So the valiant federal statisticians tasked with estimating household income in the real world must muddle through more or less elegantly here, as bravely they do.

HEADLINE: Sociologist's Paper Raises Questions on Role of Faith in Scholarship

BYLINE: By MARK OPPENHEIMER. 
mark.e.oppenheimer @gmail.com; twitter/markopp1

 BODY:
In June, a sociologist named Mark Regnerus published a paper arguing that young adults with a parent who had had a same-sex relationship fared worse than those raised by biological parents without histories of same-sex relationships.
He found, for example, that if your mother had a lesbian relationship, you were more likely to have been on welfare, to be unemployed, even to have been molested. Those with gay fathers did not suffer quite as badly, but they too led bleaker lives, between the ages of 18 and 39, than peers from ''intact biological families.''
Dr. Regnerus, who teaches at the University of Texas at Austin, was immediately called a fraud, a charlatan, a shill for the religious right. Two hundred scholars signed a letter attacking his paper and the journal, Social Science Research, that published it. 
Responding to a complaint from an anti-Regnerus blogger, the University of Texas conducted an inquiry. In August, an investigator exonerated Dr. Regnerus -- but only after reading his e-mails and scrutinizing his research methods and data. In his Aug. 24 report, the investigator, Robert A. Peterson, wrote that he found ''no evidence'' of scientific misconduct in Dr. Regnerus's study. But whether the study ''possessed significant limitations or was even perhaps seriously flawed is a determination that should be left to debates that are currently under way in the academy.''
Some criticism of Dr. Regnerus was well deserved; for example, he included in the same category the children of stable same-sex couples and children whose parents' marriage dissolved after a gay affair. And it is understandable that he is still gun-shy (he refused to be interviewed for this column). But even if he won't talk about his research, we should. It raises important questions about family structure, and -- just as interesting -- asks whether religious beliefs can shape scholarship.
Dr. Regnerus's critics have made much of the conservative institutions, the Witherspoon Institute and the Bradley Foundation, that financed his study. But it's actually pretty easy to ignore sponsors, once their check has been cashed. It is harder to ignore one's deepest convictions. Although he does not discuss it now, Dr. Regnerus has a long history as an outspoken Christian who once said his faith and his scholarship were intertwined. So it is fair to ask what he meant.
In 1993, Dr. Regnerus graduated from Trinity Christian College, a Reformed, or Calvinist, college in Palos Heights, Ill. In an alumnus profile on the school's Web site, he is quoted as saying, ''I've noticed that some Christian professors see a disconnect between their faith and their profession. I believe that if your faith matters, it should inform what you teach and what you research.''
Dr. Regnerus was raised and educated as a Dutch Calvinist, but last year he became a Roman Catholic. On Dec. 30, Dr. Regnerus was the subject of a profile on the Web site of the University of Notre Dame, where he was a visiting researcher. It says that for Dr. Regnerus, faith and scholarship go together.
''Mark alluded to the fact that his academic interest in family formation trends and processes had arisen while still an evangelical, and his recent entrance into the Catholic Church has shaped his own thinking about fertility and family life,'' the profile says. Dr. Regnerus ''also hinted at future contributions that his academic research could potentially make to the larger Catholic Church.''
Because Dr. Regnerus would not be interviewed, it is impossible to know his latest views about the relationship between his faith and research. But we can still ask if, in principle, belief in the divinity of Jesus could affect one's social science. Put another way: Is there a Christian way to crunch numbers?
''The answer, in my personal opinion, is no,'' said Mark Chaves, a sociologist of religion at Duke Divinity School. But, he added, religious concerns ''can very profoundly shape the kinds of questions we ask, and what we're interested in, what we think is important and so on.'' So while ''in the narrowest sense it doesn't affect his computations,'' Dr. Regnerus's Christian faith may have drawn him to questions about same-sex relationships and family structure.
And a religious worldview, like any worldview, can dispose a researcher toward certain mistakes in thinking. Somebody critical of same-sex relationships may be more likely to group all such relationships together, as Dr. Regnerus did. If homosexual acts are depraved, as many religious people believe, then long-term coupling may be no better, or even worse, than bursts of promiscuity.
Christian Smith, one of Dr. Regnerus's advisers at the University of North Carolina and now at Notre Dame agrees that a sociologist's religion should affect only his choice of topics, not his methodology.
''I believe there is sociology that is practiced in perhaps somewhat different ways by people with different backgrounds of all sorts -- racial, socioeconomic, gender and religious, among others,'' Dr. Smith said. But every sociologist ''operates with the same basic disciplinary approach, methods and standards of evidence.'' Dr. Smith said that while he had not talked with his former student ''about any possible connection of faith to topic/design,'' he was ''quite sure his faith did not influence the design.'' But he said he could ''only speculate'' whether Dr. Regnerus's faith led to his interest in the topic.
So if there is not really a Christian method in sociology, but there is a role for a self-described Christian in sociology, as Dr. Regnerus once averred, then what is that role? One can imagine several answers.
First, the religious -- or atheist, for that matter -- sociologist might have a set of topics that she finds particularly relevant to her beliefs. Given their traditions' emphasis on traditional family, for example, a conservative Catholic or evangelical Protestant could reasonably gravitate toward the study of family structure.
Second, a scholar might have faith that good research ultimately brings people to God or furthers his plans. A Christian historian might trust that even a modest study of the Spanish-American War, or of Rhode Island history, would do a small part to reveal the providential nature of all history.
Finally, a scholar might be a ''Christian scholar'' by virtue of the pride he takes in his faith, especially in the secular academy. Dr. Regnerus was a proud Christian witness, once upon a time. But these days he won't discuss his faith, even with a Christian magazine. Two weeks ago, Christianity Today ran a lengthy interview with Dr. Regnerus in which he said nothing about his religious beliefs.
''I just didn't think it was a profitable line of inquiry,'' Dr. Regnerus said, in the one answer he would e-mail me. ''I still don't -- sorry.''

HEADLINE: Scouting Interest Rates

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
Earlier this week, Bucks wrote about using "laddering" of certificates of deposit as a way to eke out extra interest on your savings. The Web site NerdWallet has done an analysis of banks and credit unions, and has another suggestion for increasing savings rates: promotional or bonus rates on C.D.'s. 
While interest rates over all are meager, some institutions -- typically credit unions or smaller community banks -- may be offering time-limited rates to attract deposits as part of their capital strategy. Usually, such offers apply only to new funds coming in from elsewhere. You won't get the bonus rate if you're rolling over an existing C.D. at the bank. So if you're willing to shop around, and can resign yourself to moving your money when the promotional rate expires, you can increase the interest rate you earn -- and often tie up your money for a shorter period of time, NerdWallet found.
For its analysis, NerdWallet looked at data from Market Rates Insight for the 12 months ending in September and found that bonus rates over all offered up to an additional 0.68 percent over average rates. The average annual percentage yield for a three-year C.D., for instance, was just 0.7 percent, but the average bonus yield for the same term was nearly double that, at 1.38 percent.
The analysis also found that longer-term C.D.'s don't always yield higher returns than short-term certificates, when bonus rates are taken into account. Over the last year, for instance, one-year C.D.'s actually had lower rates than shorter, three- to nine-month bonus C.D.'s, NerdWallet determined.
The catch, of course, is finding these promotional rates, which by their nature are offered for a limited time. NerdWallet has started a weekly index, showing how promotional rates compare with average C.D. rates, and featuring some of the most attractive promotional rates available around the country. Consumers can use those rates as a point of comparison for promotional deals they may find at credit unions or community banks closer to home. (The site also offers a tool to help search by ZIP code for the best interest rates on C.D.'s and savings accounts, but it generally doesn't include promotional rates, which change frequently.)
The caveat with credit unions is that they often have membership restrictions -- you have to work for certain employers, or live in a specific geographic area.
One credit union highlighted by NerdWallet this week, for example, is Service Credit Union, which serves military families as well as residents of specific towns in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. If you meet the membership criteria, you can join and avail yourself of a three-month C.D. with a 0.9 percent annual percentage yield.
Community banks may offer such rates, too, often without some of the membership hurdles, NerdWallet notes. Doral Bank in New York is offering a two-year C.D. at a 1.5 percent yield, NerdWallet found.
What do you think? Is it worth chasing promotional rates to earn more interest?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Global Perspective: More Economic Slowing

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
WORLD economic growth is faltering, the International Monetary Fund said this week, as it forecast that most of the large developed economies would either shrink this year or grow at paltry rates of 2 percent or less. Developing economies will do better, but the forecasts for them are falling as well. 
''The world economic recovery continues, but it has weakened further,'' the fund's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, told a news conference in Tokyo, where the I.M.F. and World Bank were holding their annual meetings. ''In advanced economies, growth is now too low to make a substantial dent in unemployment, and in major emerging markets, growth, which had been strong earlier, has also decreased.''
As can be seen in the accompanying chart, only Japan and the United States, among the large industrialized countries, are now forecast to grow more than 2 percent this year, and both are pegged to grow just 2.2 percent. The figures refer to growth for the entire year relative to the previous year, not to a comparison of the fourth quarter of each year.
In April, the I.M.F. forecast that global growth would be 3.5 percent in 2012 -- the slowest rate in three years -- but would rise to 4.1 percent in 2013. Now it forecasts growth of just 3.3 percent this year, and 3.6 percent in 2013.
The British economy, which in April was expected to post modest growth of 0.8 percent this year, now is expected to shrink by 0.4 percent.
Some of the sharpest cuts in the forecasts came in major developing economies; the forecast of Brazil's growth this year was cut in half to 1.5 percent.
But Mr. Blanchard emphasized that ''we do not see these developments, be it in China, India, or Brazil, as signs of a hard landing in any of these countries.'' He added, ''Indeed, we see positive policy measures being taken in all three countries, but the numbers suggest that these countries are going to have lower growth for some time, at least lower than some of the very high growth rates that we saw in earlier times.''
Brazil is still seen as likely to experience a rapid rebound in growth, rising to 4 percent in 2013. The fund's World Economic Outlook praised the country for ''targeted fiscal measures aimed at boosting demand in the near term'' and for easing its monetary policy.
In general, the report praised central banks in developing countries for their innovative ways of easing monetary policies, like bond purchases. It said that at the moment, fiscal stimulus was likely to have a larger impact than it normally would, although the ability of countries to apply such stimulus was limited by the need to bring deficits under control over the longer term.
Growth rates are forecast to rise in most countries in 2013, but not in the United States, where it is forecast to dip to 2.1 percent, or in Japan, where the rate is expected to fall to 1.2 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S. Consumer Sentiment Jumps to a 5-Year High

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Consumer sentiment unexpectedly rose to its highest level in five years in October in the latest in a string of encouraging economic signs.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary October reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 83.1, up from 78.3 in September, and the highest since September 2007, the survey showed on Friday. 
The new buoyancy among consumers comes shortly after the nation's unemployment rate tumbled in September to its lowest in nearly four years.
''We are getting some quite interesting signals from consumer sentiment and employment data,'' said David Sloan, an economist at 4Cast in New York.
The sentiment reading was well above the median forecast for a decline to 78 among economists surveyed by Reuters as consumers felt better about the economy.
The compilers of the survey said consumers felt better about the economy in both the long and the short term.
''What changed was how they evaluated economic conditions,'' the survey director, Richard T. Curtin, said in a statement. ''Economic conditions during the year ahead were expected to be 'good' by more consumers, and more consumers expected 'good' economic times over the next five years.''
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations jumped to 79.5 from 73.5, well above an expected reading of 74. Expectations were at their highest since July 2007.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions rose to 88.6 from 85.7 and was above a forecast of 86.
Also on Friday, the Economic Cycle Research Institute, a New York-based independent forecasting group, said its measure of future economic expansion pushed higher last week, while the annualized growth rate rose to its loftiest in more than a year.
The institute said its Weekly Leading Index increased to 127.7 last week from a revised 126.2 the previous week. The index's annualized growth rate accelerated to its highest level since May 2011, at 5.7 percent from 4.6 percent.
A separate report showed producer prices rose more than expected in September as the cost of gasoline surged, but underlying inflation pressures were muted in a sign the Federal Reserve has room to carry out its new monetary stimulus program.
''If you take out food and energy, you are essentially looking at a number that didn't go anywhere and was actually probably a little weaker than expected,'' said Cary Leahey, an economist at Decision Economics.
''These kinds of energy prices are debilitating to the economy and it is one of the reasons why we haven't been able to get any kind of a glide speed above a 2 percent annual rate.''
The Labor Department said on Friday its seasonally adjusted Producer Price Index increased 1.1 percent last month. Economists polled by Reuters had expected prices at farms, factories and refineries to rise 0.7 percent after climbing 1.7 percent in August.
The Labor Department's report agreed with the sentiment survey that showed consumers' one-year inflation expectations fell to 3.1 percent from 3.3 percent.

HEADLINE: F.T.C. Said To Prepare For Lawsuit Vs. Google

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR; Claire Cain Miller and Edward Wyatt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Federal Trade Commission is raising the ante in its antitrust confrontation with Google with the commission staff preparing a recommendation that the government sue the search giant.
The government's escalating pursuit of Google is the most far-reaching antitrust investigation of a corporation since the landmark federal case against Microsoft in the late 1990s. The agency's central focus is whether Google manipulates search results to favor its own products, and makes it harder for competitors and their products to appear prominently on a results page.
The staff recommendation is in a detailed draft memo of more than 100 pages that is being shared with the five F.T.C. commissioners, said two people briefed on the inquiry.
The memo is still being edited and changes could be made, but these are mostly fine-tuning and will not alter the broad conclusions reached after an inquiry that began more than a year ago, said these people, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified. 
Google said in a statement on Friday, ''We are happy to answer any questions that regulators have about our business.'' In the past it has said many times that ''competition is a click away.''
The commission is also building a team to take Google to court, if it comes to that. Last spring, it hired a seasoned litigator to help with the case, Beth A. Wilkinson, a partner in the firm Paul, Weiss in Washington. In a further sign that it means business, last week it brought on a well-known economist as a consultant: Richard Gilbert of the University of California, Berkeley.
The F.T.C. staff memo does not mean that the government will sue Google for antitrust violations. Next, the vote of three of the five F.T.C. commissioners would be required. And each step is a further prod for Google to make concessions to reach a settlement before going to court. Last month, Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the F.T.C., said a final decision on whether to sue Google would be made before the end of this year.
The Google investigation echoes the Microsoft case in a basic way. Google, like Microsoft in the personal computer industry, has drawn complaints from rivals and antitrust regulators as it has expanded its business beyond its dominant product, search and search advertising. Google has aggressively built off this main business to fields including online commerce and smartphone software.
As it expands its empire, Google takes on new competitors and brings formidable resources. Rivals may suffer, Google says, but the company is improving its products and services, benefiting consumers and the economy.
The American inquiry is moving in tandem with a major antitrust investigation in Europe. The European authorities are pressing ahead and seeking changes in Google's behavior.
Speaking in New York last month, Joaquín Almunia, the European Union's competition commissioner, pointed to antitrust regulators' concerns that Google is ''using its dominance in online search to foreclose rival specialized search engines and search advertisers.''
Google is also being investigated by the attorneys general of six states: Texas, Ohio, New York, California, Oklahoma and Mississippi.
Given the momentum of the investigations, antitrust experts say, the F.T.C. staff recommendation was to some extent expected.
The F.T.C. investigators have looked at a wide range of Google's business practices, according to companies that have been questioned and received subpoenas from the agency.
The areas of inquiry include accusations of manipulating the search results it displays to favor Google commerce services it has developed like Google Shopping for buying goods and Google Places for advertising local restaurants and businesses. In the civilian subpoenas, the F.T.C. calls this ''preferencing.''
The investigators are also looking into whether Google's automated advertising marketplace, AdWords, discriminates against advertisers from competing online commerce services like comparison shopping sites and consumer review Web sites.
The government is also investigating Google's practices in the smartphone industry, inquiring if its contracts with handset makers and carriers prevent them from removing or modifying Google products, like its Android operating system or Google search. In addition, it is looking into Google's use of smartphone patents.
But the critical antitrust issue involves how Google proceeds as it expands.
One company that has been questioned by the F.T.C. is NexTag, a comparison shopping service that since June has been known as Wize Commerce. As Google built up its shopping offerings in the last two years, NexTag executives say the traffic to its site from Google's search engine has fallen, suggesting that Google is manipulating its search results to harm a commerce competitor. In the last year, the online traffic to NexTag from Google search has fallen by half, the company says.
But NexTag has taken steps to adjust. In the last year, it has acquired two other sites and invested heavily in its underlying technology to help Web sites attract online visitors, especially ones most likely to purchase their goods.
The NexTag site has also become more aggressive with Google -- doubling the amount it spends on Google paid ads in the last five months. The move hurts profits, but 60 percent of NexTag's traffic comes from Google search and Google paid ads.
''We need to be competitive when they own the show,'' said Jeffrey G. Katz, chief executive of Wize Commerce.
The company's adaptive strategy, Mr. Katz said, includes expanding its partnerships with other Web businesses including Facebook, Microsoft's Bing, Yahoo and Twitter, though none loom as large as Google.
The company, based in San Mateo, Calif., is still profitable and growing with 450 employees.
The most probable outcome of the antitrust investigations of Google, antitrust experts say, is a settlement. The broad principle, they say, would be an agreement not to discriminate in favor of its products over smaller competitors.
In Europe, Google has proposed more clearly labeling when its own offering like Google Shopping appears in a search result, according to a person briefed on the proposal.
But regulators, antitrust experts say, will most likely push for more sweeping commitments on Google's corporate conduct in the future to try to ensure that the company will not use its powerful position in Internet search to give it an unfair advantage in other businesses and stifle competition, which antitrust prohibits.
Just how governments might try to enforce a principle of nondiscrimination in fields as fast-moving as Internet search, online commerce and smartphones will be challenging.
The American Antitrust Institute, an organization based in Washington, typically leans toward aggressive antitrust enforcement. It opposed a couple of Google's acquisitions on antitrust grounds.
''But this is a tough one,'' Albert A. Foer, president of the antitrust institute, said of the broad antitrust pursuit of Google. ''That's why we haven't taken a position yet.''
''Still, there is a shadow effect to public and government scrutiny that has an impact in and of itself,'' Mr. Foer added. ''And in a dynamic industry that might not be so bad.''

HEADLINE: Rolling Back a Tax Increase via Facebook

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN

 BODY:
PARIS -- In a matter of days, a nimble group of entrepreneurs, most of them in the information technology business, managed something that slogan-chanting street demonstrations rarely achieve: They got the French government to roll back parts of an unpopular tax measure that they considered fatal to their start-up businesses.
Now known as ''les pigeons,'' a French slang word they adopted because they don't want to be the government's ''fall guys,'' the two-week-old group also managed to galvanize French big business into an alliance of bosses and pigeons, which issued a joint statement last Tuesday calling on the government to retreat further. 
So how did a group of irreverent Internet ''start-uppeurs'' (a bit of Franglais that has cropped up in French techie vocabulary), who run companies with very un-French names like Kwarter, Whoozer, Ebuzzing, Kelkoo and Meetic, some very successfully, manage to bestir both France's political class and its boardrooms?
All it took was a Facebook page, introduced Sept. 28, which followed the publication the same day of an opinion piece in La Tribune, a French business newspaper, by Jean-David Chamboredon, 49, veteran investor in French I.T. start-ups, who has now become the pigeons' spokesman.
But it was the Internet that did the trick. Within 15 days, about 67,000 followers had ''liked'' the pigeons' Facebook page and were busy sharing it all over the globe, including among the many French entrepreneurs who have taken up residence elsewhere, 500 in California alone.
''This thing has taken on a scale that I could never have imagined,'' said Mr. Chamboredon, a graduate of the prestigious École Polytechnique who did a three-year stint in Silicon Valley and is now president of ISAI, an investment fund he founded two and a half years ago that employs 200 people.
In an interview at the company's modest offices on the ground floor of a courtyard one block from the Arc de Triomphe, Mr. Chamboredon, true to the style of a start-uppeur, rushed across the courtyard to open the office himself, appearing tieless, in a casual jacket.
This is a far cry from the polished veneer of the French business elite, which is precisely why, in Mr. Chamboredon's view, the French public -- traditionally suspicious of business -- has looked kindly on the pigeons.
''When the French see a little start-up boss who pays himself the minimum wage, eats pasta and doesn't know if he has enough cash to finish the quarter, they don't see him as a 'grand patron' -- he's not the capitalist,'' he said.
What set off the protest was a proposed change in the capital gains tax, which would increase it from roughly 34.5 percent, including 15.5 percent for social charges, on a sliding scale, to a maximum of 63.5 percent for high-end investors who cash out within two years. It is the byproduct of President François Hollande's campaign pledge as the Socialist Party's candidate to bring taxes on capital in line with France's progressive income tax.
With the French economy now at a standstill, Mr. Hollande is trying to push through a tough budget for 2013, and has scoured the economy for ways to raise taxes, particularly on the rich. It includes his most controversial provision, which would levy a 75 percent tax on people earning more than &#x20ac;1 million, or about $1.3 million.
The capital gains measure was part of the government's efforts to spare the middle class any higher taxes and focus on income earned through investment instead.
Making the capital gains tax more progressive, over a long period of time, doesn't bother Mr. Chamboredon. The British, the Germans and the Swedes have something like that in place, he said. It was the vehemence of the attack on start-up capital, the lifeblood of all fledgling enterprises, that took him aback. ''What was shocking here was the violence of the changes, not the principle,'' he said.
''If you tell people that they have one in two chances to lose money when they invest in a start-up, but if they earn money, they will be taxed at 60 percent, there's absolutely no reason to invest,'' he said.
The danger, of course, is that France's pigeons will simply fly away, joining what some fear is a swelling migration of rich French people to Britain, Belgium and elsewhere.
''If you have a company and you know you will have to sell it, you need to think about it, and exiting France is a scenario,'' Mr. Chamboredon said.
The government responded to the pigeon protest within the first few days, offering, for instance, to exempt active founders from the tax increase. The entrepreneurs have dismissed these concessions as an offer to pluck everything but the head of the bird.
In Mr. Chamboredon's view, the pigeons have already landed themselves a place in history by upending the usual sequence of French political discourse, which often involves street protests.
''This time, the legislation was trotted out, there was a demonstration -- a mobilization -- on the Internet that was completely peaceful,'' he said. Now, the discussion -- which heads next week to the National Assembly -- can begin, in the open and in earnest.

HEADLINE: South Korea: Warning on Missile

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- A senior South Korean policy maker on North Korea said on Friday that it must be assumed that the North has the capacity to mount a nuclear device on a ballistic missile, adding that such a capability would pose ''an existential threat'' to South Korea. 
The official, who spoke to a group of journalists on condition of anonymity, stressed that reliable information about the North's capabilities is scarce, and he cautioned that he was not confirming that the North had built an operational nuclear weapon. But his comment, which was one of the most explicitly worded assessments of the North's nuclear and missile capabilities by a senior official, reflected growing concern in the South Korean government that the North may have more advanced technology than previously believed.
''We must assume that North Korea has already reached the stage'' of ''being able to mount a nuclear device on its ballistic missiles,'' the official said. ''If not, they are getting closer to that level.''
The official made the comment while explaining why South Korea and the United States had recently reached a deal under which South Korea will be allowed to nearly triple the range of its ballistic missiles, giving it the ability to strike all known North Korean missile sites. He said the South now had ''less margin of error, because North Korean ballistic missiles tipped with a nuclear explosive would be an existential threat to us.''
The missile agreement with the United States was announced Sunday. On Tuesday, the North claimed to have missiles that can reach the American mainland, and on Wednesday it said it felt freer to conduct long-range missile tests in light of the American-South Korean missile accord.
The South Korean official said he could not verify the North's recent claims, stressing the paucity of reliable information. ''There is no such thing as a North Korea expert,'' he said. ''No one has enough information about North Korea.'' But he said there was no doubt that the North was determined to develop the means to deliver a nuclear warhead.
Since 1998, North Korea has launched several long-range rockets, which Washington and allies have considered a cover for testing long-range missile technology. They all exploded in midair or failed in their stated purpose of putting satellites into orbit, casting doubt on the North's ability to deliver a payload on an intercontinental ballistic missile.
In a paper published by the RAND Corporation earlier this month, an analyst, Markus Schiller, said that there were strong indications that North Korea's missiles served largely as ''a bluff'' to ''create the impression of a serious missile threat and thereby gain strategic leverage, fortify the North Korean regime's domestic power, and deter other countries.''
''It cannot be ruled out that North Korea has nuclear warhead designs for its missiles, but without actual testing, the reliability of these warheads has to be assumed to be low,'' he wrote. ''It seems likely that the North Korean missile threat is limited to the range of its Nodong missile,'' roughly 1,000 kilometers. ''Missiles beyond this range seem not to be operationally deployed or sufficiently reliable.''

HEADLINE: Wall St. Dips, Ending Worst Week in 4 Months

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The United States stock market wrapped up its worst week in four months, led lower on Friday by financial shares as results from Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase stoked concerns about shrinking profit margins for big lenders.
Shares of Wells Fargo fell 2.6 percent, to $34.25, and JPMorgan stock lost 1.1 percent, to $41.62, as concerns grew over their lower net-interest margin -- the difference between what a bank pays on deposits and what it makes on loans -- which could narrow further as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates near zero.
Both Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, the two largest American financial stocks by market value, reported record profits, but investors were cautious nonetheless. 
''Bank shares as a group have had a nice move this year so far,'' said Kenneth Polcari, managing director at ICAP Equities in New York. ''Guidance is cautious, so people are taking money off the table.''
The results prompted a sell-off in the shares of other banks as well. A Standard & Poor's financial index, down 1.4 percent, represented the worst performer of the S.& P. 500's top 10 sectors. The KBW Bank index lost 2.5 percent.
Mr. Polcari said the low volume that came with this week's decline indicated this was not a sign of panic. Since hitting a near five-year intraday high of 1,474.51 on Sept. 14, the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has fallen 3.1 percent.
''If we keep getting negative reports, selling will pick up,'' he said.
Expectations are low for S.& P. 500 companies' results. Quarterly earnings are forecast to fall 3 percent from a year ago, compared with a 2.1 percent drop estimated at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters data.
The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 2.46 points, or 0.02 percent, to 13,328.85 at the close. But the S.& P. 500 fell 4.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to finish at 1,428.59. The Nasdaq composite dipped 5.30 points, or 0.17 percent, to 3,044.11.
The S.& P. 500 closed right above its 50-day moving average, barely enough to avoid going into the weekend with a technical red flag hanging over the market.
Despite several encouraging data points this week, the benchmark S.& P. 500 fell 2.2 percent -- its worst weekly performance since the week that ended June 1.
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices fell 14.4 percent to $2.74 a day after the chip maker said its third-quarter revenue probably fell 10 percent from the previous quarter as a weak global economy and a growing preference for tablets slams the PC industry.
About 5.5 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, below the daily average so far this year of about 6.52 billion shares.
On the New York exchange, about seven issues fell for every four that rose. On the Nasdaq, almost two issues fell for every one that advanced.
Earlier in the session, the market was supported by Thomson Reuters-University of Michigan data showing that American consumer sentiment unexpectedly rose to its highest in five years in October, in the latest in a string of encouraging signs about the economy.
Interest rates were flat. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 3/32, to 99 23/32, and the yield was steady at 1.66 percent compared with 1.67 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Fighting for Women in the 'Dark Heaven' of Gaza

BYLINE: By JODI RUDOREN; Fares Akram contributed reporting.

 BODY:
GAZA CITY
ANDALIB ADWAN SHEHADA has lived all but two of her 47 years here in the Gaza Strip, yet the neighbors along the alley where she and her family built a three-story home in 1998 have taken to calling them ''the foreigners.''
Maybe it is because her 13-year-old son attends the American International School. Maybe it is because drummers escorted a mixed-gender crowd into the courtyard for her daughter's recent wedding celebration. Maybe it is because Ms. Adwan, a Muslim who fasts on Ramadan but rarely enters a mosque, does not cover her dark shoulder-length hair.
Or maybe it is because she has spent her life speaking boldly about the plight of women in this male-dominated society, challenging its attitudes toward rape and honor killing and divorce, spotlighting the abuse of women in a community that traditionally keeps it locked inside families and homes. 
''I think life in Gaza is not suitable for a human -- now it's worse than yesterday,'' she said in a recent interview, describing a ''psychological siege'' imposed by a combination of Israeli restrictions on travel and trade and the hegemony of the militant Hamas faction over local government and society. ''If I accept that I deserve this kind of life, I will be losing the hope. I believe I deserve a better life than this, so I'll still fight.''
Ms. Adwan, who goes by her original last name -- which when combined with her first name means ''aggressive nightingale'' -- lost a personal battle last month when Israel's Supreme Court rejected a petition by her and three other women to study in the West Bank. Ms. Adwan began a master's degree in gender studies at Birzeit University in 1999 but was blocked from attending classes after two semesters because of the second intifada.
Her larger crusade, though, continues here in Gaza, where she established the Community Media Center in 2007 to train Palestinians in using documentary films and other techniques to expose the difficulties of daily life. The center, whose $200,000 annual budget comes from Western organizations including Catholic Relief Services and the United States Agency for International Development, is the latest in a series of groups that Ms. Adwan has helped start or run since 1991.
Her activism dates to her childhood in the Rafah refugee camp, where she was the only girl to make announcements over the school public address system and to participate in the student movement of the early 1980s, which led to a two-day suspension. By 16, she published the first of many short stories about what is universally known here as ''the situation.''
The 10th of 13 children born to a woman married off at age 12, Ms. Adwan was groomed for a distinct path by her father. He was the mukhtar -- akin to mayor -- of the village of Barbara, north of the Gaza Strip, and then of the Rafah camp, where his family landed after Israel's establishment in 1948. Ms. Adwan remembers tagging along to meetings of the Rafah municipality and with Israeli officials.
SO, though she is the rare Gaza woman who has traveled to European and Arab capitals, Ms. Adwan ''is more connected with people on the ground,'' said Issam Younis, the director of Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, a Gaza group whose board Ms. Adwan has been on for three years. ''She's not the kind of elite woman.''
Indeed, Ms. Adwan dismissed questions like whether women should be seen in public without a head scarf or be allowed to smoke shisha at cafes -- both largely taboo in this conservative area -- as bourgeois, saying: ''How many women go to these cafes and want to have shisha? You can count the women who don't cover their hair.''
But critics denounce her as a leftist who refused to cooperate with government efforts on women or to invite Hamas officials to her events. Amira Haron, an Islamic women's rights advocate, said she was effectively wasting time promoting a ''different, Western agenda.''
''The work should be based, derived and inspired from the national agenda,'' Ms. Haron said. ''My agenda should mainly be the resistance of the Israeli occupation as a priority, because occupation is the source of all troubles.''
Rema Hammami, a professor at Birzeit who has known Ms. Adwan for two decades, noted that many other Gazan feminists had fled in frustration, but that she had stayed because she was ''stubbornly in love with Gaza.''
Ms. Adwan herself described Gaza as a ''dark heaven.'' Living in Cairo for two years because of her husband's work as a television news producer, she said they were treated ''as foreigners'' and were compelled to return home, despite the difficulties.
''We have to be here,'' she said. ''Our family lives here, our house is here, our memories, our history.''
Still, she was desperate to study in the West Bank, where she said ''the minds are different because they haven't the siege.'' But the Israeli court ruled, 2 to 1, against the four women on Sept. 24, accepting the state's position that giving them travel permits would ''undermine the 'separation' policy, which is based on both security and political considerations.''
Instead, Ms. Adwan is finishing a master's in Middle Eastern studies -- her thesis is on how the print news media dealt with women's issues during and after the Gaza war in 2008-9 -- at Al Azhar University here. Her Community Media Center, with eight employees, has published two newspapers highlighting prison conditions for women and youths, and it plans to host a film festival about human rights on Oct. 21.
Her agenda is topped by improving women's standing in divorce and custody proceedings, and strengthening penalties against rapists and honor killers. But she is equally concerned about daily struggles like the electricity here, which is on for eight hours, then off for eight.
''I don't know if you can imagine the situation in darkness,'' she said. ''It's very, very difficult to just sit and wait for the electricity to come. It's very difficult to walk on the streets while the generators are running. I cannot breathe from the pollution. I cannot hear the person walking with me.''
HER daughter's recent wedding, to a Gazan who works at a car dealership in New Jersey, was the first time in six years that the entire family was together here at their home. The salmon-color walls remain pockmarked by shrapnel from 2009, when an Israeli warplane hit an apartment building nearby; $3,000 from the United Nations refugee agency was not enough to fix them after the blown-out windows were replaced. The large first-floor kitchen is open to the salon, in the style of an American great room, something else seen as foreign in Gaza, where women cooking are usually shielded from guests' view.
On the coffee table is a menagerie of 13 elephant figurines, wooden and china and metal, from travels in Cyprus, Egypt, Spain, Morocco and France. On the floor, a stone elephant missing a tusk stands guard.
''They are peaceful animals; they are not hurting anyone, even though they are big and can hurt,'' Ms. Adwan said to explain her collection. ''It's the top of morals, to have the power and not use it against anyone.''

HEADLINE: A Nobel for the Continent

 BODY:
Perhaps we should congratulate the European Union for winning the Nobel Peace Prize and let it go at that. It is not, after all, unusual for the Norwegian committee to select an organization rather than an individual, and the E.U. surely satisfies Alfred Nobel's criteria of forging fraternity between nations, reducing standing armies, and holding and promoting peace congresses. 
There is no question that the E.U. has come to symbolize the transformation of a continent mired for centuries in war to one that has embraced peace and human rights. And by opening its doors to newly liberated members of the Soviet bloc, the E.U. certainly helped to break down the division of East and West.
But when the Norwegian Nobel Committee selects the E.U. for a peace prize just when Europe is going through a major and potentially destructive crisis, it is obvious that, once again, the Norwegians have chosen to send a political message. Thorbjorn Jagland, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, acknowledged as much in a news conference: ''We want to remind us all what can happen if disintegration starts and if we let extremism and nationalism start growing again in Europe.'' Again, that is not new: the Nobel Committee has regularly stirred controversy by using the award to encourage and endorse political courses of action. The award to Barack Obama less than a year into his presidency or to Le Duc Tho and Henry Kissinger in 1973 are only two of many examples.
Yet we find ourselves asking whether it is really the job of the committee to use this award to get involved in current affairs rather than to single out great achievements, as the awards to Albert Schweitzer and Mother Teresa did. And we find it a bit hard to accept the singling out of the E.U. (which Norwegians have voted against joining) for its fostering of peace in Europe since World War II, when NATO and the United States were at least as responsible.
But all that aside, who can begrudge the E.U. a dollop of positive reinforcement at this time? There is little question that the E.U. is a remarkable achievement, and if this award helps it overcome its current woes, good. One way to do that would be to give the award money to Greece.

HEADLINE: University Endowments Face a Hard Landing

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
For years, America's largest, richest and most prestigious universities have been the envy of investors. They churned out double-digit returns over the last two decades, even with steep losses during the financial crisis. Harvard's endowment today is over $30 billion and has generated annualized returns of 12.5 percent over the last 20 years.
Their investing success along with their vaunted academic reputations led many financial experts to conclude that Harvard and its peers at the pinnacle of higher education had solved an age-old conundrum: how to generate higher returns with lower risk.
An investment stampede ensued as other universities, giant pension funds and even individuals slavishly copied their strategy, which stressed diversification along with high-cost, often illiquid alternative investments like hedge funds, venture capital and private equity funds. Today, it's hard to find a college or university that stuck with the older and far simpler allocation between stocks and bonds. Hedge funds alone currently have what is estimated at over $2 trillion in assets, much of it from large institutions. 
College and university endowment returns for the most recent fiscal year, which ended June 30, are starting to roll in. And in many cases, they warrant a grade of C at best, and in some cases, an F. Harvard reported a 0.05 percent loss and a drop in its endowment of over $1 billion in the same period, even as a simple Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fund gained about 5.5 percent. Harvard's endowment decline is more than the entire endowments of roughly 90 percent of all colleges and universities.
Even more startling, data compiled by the National Association of College and University Business Officers for the 2011 fiscal year (the most recent available) show that large, medium and small endowments all underperformed a simple mix of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds over one-, three- and five-year periods. The 91 percent of endowments with less than $1 billion in assets underperformed in every time period since records have been maintained. Given the weak results being reported this year, that underperformance is likely to be even more pronounced when the fiscal year 2012 results are included.
The impact is significant. Universities depend on returns on their endowments to finance operations, pay faculty and administrative salaries, provide scholarships and pay for building projects. Harvard said it planned to spend $172 million this year on need-based scholarships. Many colleges budget 4 to 6 percent of the endowment's value for current spending. At Harvard, funds from the endowment account for 35 percent of the university's annual budget.
''The compelling simplicity of a 60/40 strategy is very hard to beat,'' Timothy J. Keating, president of Keating Investments in Greenwood Village, Colo., and author of two reports on endowment performance, told me this week. ''Many investors would be much better served with a simple 60/40 strategy, or at least a core where you have low-cost index funds. When you understand the role of transaction fees, it's a very high mountain to scale.''
Those fees for so-called alternative investments can be enormous. Hedge fund and private equity fund managers typically keep 20 percent or more of the gains, which is known as carried interest, and a percentage of assets under management. Private equity, real estate and natural resources partnerships may also impose an array of transaction fees on top of performance fees. ''The audacity of Wall Street at extracting fees never ceases to amaze me,'' Mr. Keating said.
Simon Lack, a founder of SL Advisors in Westfield, N.J., and a hedge fund insider -- he allocated capital to hedge funds during his 23 years at JPMorgan Chase -- caused a stir earlier this year with his book, ''The Hedge Fund Mirage,'' in which he calculated that the hedge fund industry as a whole lost more money in one year (2008) than it had made in the previous 10 years. ''If all the money that's ever been invested in hedge funds had been put in Treasury bills instead, the results would have been twice as good,'' he asserted. And he maintained that nearly all the hedge funds' gains had gone to hedge fund managers rather than clients.
''If you look at the data, hedge funds have underperformed a simple 60/40 stock/bond mix every year for the past 10 years,'' Mr. Lack told me this week. ''They did well in the downturn of 2000-2. But that's when assets under management were less than half what they are now. There's no disputing that as assets have grown, performance has declined.''
Not surprisingly, Mr. Lack's analysis has come under attack by a vast industry that depends on steering clients into alternative investments, among them the London-based Alternative Investment Management Association, a lobbying group that issued a detailed rebuttal. But Mr. Lack said he stood by his methodology, and pointed out that many of his critics had a financial stake in maintaining the status quo. Mr. Keating, who doesn't advise endowments or pension funds, said he agreed with Mr. Lack. ''He's very controversial, but I found his analysis persuasive.''
Among those raising questions about the Ivy League model and its heavy dependence on alternative investments is Vanguard, the giant mutual fund company that has long promoted a radically simpler approach based on low-cost index and mutual funds. ''I feel that there was endowment envy, or maybe emulation is a better word,'' Francis M. Kinniry Jr., a principal in Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group, told me this week. ''Everybody wanted to look like the Yales and Harvards of the world. But they were early. They were doing these techniques in the mid-1990s and late 1990s when equities looked overvalued, and alternative strategies could capture market imperfections. That's no longer true. Those universities were forward-looking and deserve a lot of credit. But emulating that process three, five or seven years later is very problematic.''
Even David Swensen, Yale's chief investment officer, who is widely viewed as the godfather of what has become known as the Yale model, has cautioned that few could expect to replicate Yale's results, because Yale had access to top managers whose doors were closed to all but a favored few. Mr. Kinniry agreed. ''Because of their size and relationships, and the ability to commit to a continuing investment cycle, Harvard, Yale, M.I.T. and Notre Dame have unique access.''
It's true that Harvard's and Yale's endowments, in contrast to most smaller endowments, have outperformed a simpler and more conventional mix of stocks and bonds, and a Harvard spokesman noted that over the last 10 years, Harvard's endowment had generated over $12 billion more than a 60/40 model would have.
But that may be hard to replicate in the future, even for the Harvards and Yales of the world, since even access to top managers is no guarantee of future performance. ''They'll have to be very good at manager selection,'' Mr. Lack said, ''because there's been very little return persistence. I looked at one-third of the hedge fund industry. Of those in top 40 percent of returns, only 7 percent stayed there throughout the period.'' A recent example is the billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson, who after a spectacular bet against mortgage-backed securities in 2007 attracted millions from investors, but then suffered crushing losses last year. ''He deserves credit, but he had one great trade and that was it,'' Mr. Lack said of Mr. Paulson. ''He should have quit and done something else for a living.''
In addition, the high annualized returns at Harvard, Yale and a few other universities largely depended on some superlative years that are now receding into the past. As a result, their average returns are dropping. Even the top endowments experienced severe double-digit declines during the financial crisis, when hedge funds failed to perform as expected and illiquid alternative investments left some major universities facing a cash bind. Yale recently reported a gain of 4.7 percent for the fiscal year that ended June 30. Princeton said its gain would similarly be less than 5 percent. Even those mediocre returns may be better than many smaller endowments, which, like Harvard, may be facing losses.
''If you look at the endowment world as a whole,'' Mr. Keating said, ''they don't have access to the top quartile of managers. That access is uniquely provided to a few of the best investors. So what does the median venture capital or private equity return look like? It's a horror show. It's been flat to even negative. The strong get stronger and the weak get stuck with non-top quartile managers and mediocre returns and high fees.''

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo Reports A 22% Jump in Profit

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
5:42 p.m. | Updated
At the height of the financial crisis, the mortgage business was a millstone for the banking industry. Today, it is a profit center.
Wells Fargo on Friday reported $4.9 billion in profit for the third quarter, a 22 percent jump largely led by a booming mortgage business.
The bank, based in San Francisco, continues to churn out record profit, having reported 11 straight quarters of gains in net income. The results of 88 cents a share narrowly beat the estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, who forecast earnings of 87 cents a share. 
The bank's revenue increased as well, sidestepping a common sore spot that has plagued most all of the nation's biggest banks. Wells Fargo recorded $21.2 billion in revenue, which surpassed the $19.6 billion figure from a year earlier but was slightly below expectations.
The bank's lending division led the growth, as consumers refinanced their mortgages to take advantage of record low interest rates. Wells Fargo, the nation's largest mortgage lender, snared $188 billion in home mortgage applications, an 11 percent jump from the third quarter of 2011.
The bank's chief financial officer, Timothy J. Sloan, underscored that "it's more than just the mortgage business." The strong results, he noted, were spread across the bank. The wealth management unit improved. So did the sales and trading business.
"We just have the great benefit of this diversified model," Mr. Sloan said in an interview.
But investors were not fully impressed. On Friday, the bank's shares closed down 2.6 percent to $34.25, reflecting concern about net interest margin, an important measure of the income the bank makes on its assets. The measure declined in part because the bank's own investments suffered from an environment of low-interest rates.
Wells Fargo, along with JPMorgan Chase, began the bank earnings season on Friday. The nation's other big banks, including Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, will report their results next week.
The Wells Fargo story line - that a deep lending effort breeds success - is rooted in broad federal stimulus efforts that have propped up the mortgage industry. An initiative by the Treasury Department is spurring refinancings. And the Federal Reserve has introduced a long-term plan to buy large batches of mortgage-backed bonds, which should help keep rates low.
Wells Fargo, more than five years after the mortgage crisis, has seized the opportunity. The bank now creates roughly a third of all mortgages in the country. Total outstanding loans jumped slightly in the third quarter to $783 billion while the bank's home mortgage originations soared 56 percent to $139 billion.
The demand for credit came largely from refinancing, which accounted for 72 percent of all home loan applications. The Treasury program produced 14 percent of the mortgage volume.
Like other big banks, Wells Fargo makes home loans before selling most of them to investors after attaching a government guarantee. Those gains totaled $2.61 billion in the third quarter, up 225 percent from $803 million in the third quarter of last year.
The refinancing boom is fueling profits. Wells Fargo's profit in the community banking division, which includes Wells Fargo's retail branches and mortgage business, climbed 18 percent to $2.7 billion.
Despite the gains, the mortgage crisis continues to haunt Wells Fargo. The bank this summer agreed to pay $175 million to settle Justice Department accusations that it discriminated against certain minority homeowners from 2004 to 2009. Wells Fargo, which denied the charges, was also sued this week by federal prosecutors in New York, who claim the bank defrauded the government and lied about the quality of the mortgages it handled under a federal housing program.
Still, the legal troubles will barely nick the bank's bottom line.
Like JPMorgan, Wells is having growth beyond mortgages. Wholesale banking, which includes the sales and trading business along with the corporate lending division, increased its profit by 11 percent, to $1.9 billion. While the unit operates in the shadow of the Wall Street investment banks, Wells Fargo has gradually extended its reach in that area.
"There are a lot of underlying positives that will continue to drive the earnings of this company," said Edward R. Najarian, a senior bank analyst at ISI, a New York research firm.
Peter Eavis contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Turning Point for Suits Over Chinese Drywall

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
Three years ago, Colleen Stephens moved her family from a 5,000-square-foot, newly renovated home overlooking the bay in Virginia Beach into a house half the size and much farther inland.
While she was not thrilled with the move, Ms. Stephens explained, ''We would have rather lived in a tent in our backyard than put our kids back in our house.''
The bigger house had been renovated with Chinese-made drywall, and Ms. Stephens contends that it reeked and made her family sick. She filed a lawsuit seeking damages in 2009, but so far, she hasn't received a cent, in part because of the complexities of suing a manufacturer from China. 
But decisions in state and federal courts in recent weeks involving the company, a major Chinese manufacturer of drywall, could signal a turning point for thousands of American homeowners like Ms. Stephens, according to lawyers representing homeowners and homebuilders.
The Chinese manufacturer, Taishan Gypsum, argues that its drywall was not defective and that courts in the United States have no jurisdiction over the company since its drywall was sold in this country by other companies.
But a federal judge in Louisiana ruled last month in a drywall case that Taishan Gypsum was responsible for its drywall sold in Florida, Virginia and Louisiana. The ruling by United States District Court Judge Eldon E. Fallon followed a similar decision on Aug. 31 by a state judge in Florida.
Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Joseph P. Farina ruled that the plasterboard company that exported the drywall to Florida was wholly owned and controlled by Taishan Gypsum, and therefore it was subject to the court's jurisdiction.
The judge also noted that Taishan Gypsum ''actively targeted the Florida market by courting Florida companies, mailing drywall samples to Florida, selling large amounts of drywall to Florida-based companies.''
Taishan Gypsum is appealing both rulings, and the company's lawyer, Joe Cyr of Hogan Lovells, said he was confident his client would prevail. Mr. Cyr said American distributors came to China looking for drywall in 2005 and 2006.
''Taishan Gypsum did not ship any drywall to the U.S.,'' he said, adding that Taishan ''strongly disputes any claim that the drywall is defective.''
But lawyers representing homeowners and homebuilders suing over the suspect drywall suggested the rulings could have broad implications. In all, the lawyers said, about 7,000 to 10,000 homes suffered damage because of defective Chinese drywall installed in the aftermath of Hurricanes Rita and Katrina and during a building boom in the South.
''This opens the door for courts to look to Chinese manufacturers to stand behind their products,'' said Hilarie Bass, a lawyer with Greenberg Traurig in Miami who represents several builders, including Lennar Homes, which she says spent more than $40 million replacing defective drywall and is now trying to recover money from Taishan Gypsum.
The drywall dispute underscores the complexities of sorting out legal claims in an increasingly interconnected world. As Jacques deLisle, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania put it, ''Products move very easily across borders. Legal judgments, not so much.''
With the exception of the members of the European Union, countries rarely recognize court judgments from other nations. But often the problems are resolved in other ways. For instance, businesses from different countries include binding arbitration agreements in their contracts, said Stephen C. Yeazell, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Or, instead of pursuing a foreign-based company, plaintiffs often sue the American subsidiary of a foreign manufacturer or a major distributor. In the case of the defective drywall, lawsuits were filed against the entire supply chain -- builders, installers, distributors -- but none had enough money to pay the claims, said Arnold Levin, a Philadelphia lawyer representing homeowners in the case before Judge Fallon in Louisiana.
''Only the manufacturer can make this right,'' he said.
Some members of Congress have taken up the issue, introducing the Contaminated Drywall Safety Act that, among other things, says the secretary of state should insist that the government of China force manufacturers to submit to the jurisdiction of American courts. The bill passed the House last month and hasn't yet been taken up by the Senate.
In the years before the economic crisis, hundreds of millions of square feet of Chinese drywall was exported to the United States. But soon after the drywall was installed homeowners noticed a sulfurous smell. In addition, appliances like televisions and microwaves inexplicably failed, and silver and copper items were covered with black soot.
Many homeowners also complained of health problems, including headaches, respiratory ailments and skin and eye irritation. Hundreds of lawsuits were filed in state and federal courts against builders, installers, suppliers, importers and manufacturers.
The Chinese drywall was primarily manufactured by two companies, Taishan Gypsum and Knauf Plasterboard Tianjin, a Chinese affiliate of a German company. Last December, Knauf entered into an agreement to resolve the claims against it, contingent on Judge Fallon's approval next month.
Steven Glickstein, a lawyer at Kaye Scholer who represents Knauf, said the cost of the settlement depended on how many homeowners are determined to have had installed Knauf drywall. The lawsuits against Taishan Gypsum, meanwhile, are delayed until the courts consider the company's appeals of the recent rulings. Even if the homeowners and builders eventually win their cases against Taishan Gypsum, they face an even bigger challenge of collecting from the Chinese company.
Ms. Stephens, who is 44, is not getting her hopes up. ''There's no way to hold a foreign manufacturer accountable in the U.S. court system,'' she said. ''All they have decided so far is that we have jurisdiction.''
Michelle Germano, who is also suing Taishan Gypsum, moved out of her condominium in Norfolk, Va., four years ago because it was like a ''gas chamber.''
''I'm going to stay positive that something good is going to come out of this,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Another Fare Increase?

 BODY:
More than 8.5 million riders in the New York City area may soon start paying a lot more to get to work every day. Next week, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is expected to propose fare and toll increases to raise another $450 million a year. If approved, this increase, in 2013, would be the fourth in five years. 
Nobody wants to deprive the M.T.A. of vital funds, and commuters must certainly pay their fair share. But if this increase is not calibrated with great care, it will land hardest on working people at a very bad time.
The M.T.A. is a state agency, which means that Gov. Andrew Cuomo can help soften the blow. First, Mr. Cuomo and the authority's chairman, Joseph Lhota, should find ways to spare those who simply cannot afford a fourth increase. An hourly worker on minimum wage, now $7.25 an hour, can seldom manage a 30-day unlimited card (now $104) or a fancy new MetroCard with a minimum of $30 that is re-fed automatically by a credit card. The base subway fare should therefore stay put at $2.25.
So where does the authority find the $450 million? People who can afford a 30-day unlimited ride could probably pay more, though the proposed increase to $125 mentioned in some published accounts seems a bit steep. More crucially, the state and city need to step up to the plate. Mr. Lhota said last month that ''when you compare the public support given to mass transit agencies nationwide on a per customer basis, New York ranks at the very bottom.'' New York subway riders, for example, contribute 72 percent of the cost of their commute, compared with 53 percent in Chicago and 34 percent in Atlanta.
Earlier this month, New York's comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, praised the authority for ''slowly improving'' its finances with cost cutting, increased ridership, and a payroll tax in the 12-county region that brings in about $1.8 billion for the $13 billion budget. He warned, however, that recent fare and toll increases are outpacing inflation and are ''placing a burden on working men and women across the metropolitan region.''
It's true that both the governor and the mayor must make up for years of stingy budgets. But the transit structure fuels the state and city economy. It needs more support from both, and less from the beleaguered commuter.

HEADLINE: Palestinian Artwork At Brandeis

BYLINE: By EMILY GOGOLAK

 BODY:
WALTHAM, Mass. -- It's been a tough few years for art at Brandeis University. Its Rose museum has been struggling to recover from a near-death experience since it tried to sell its distinguished collection in 2009 to fill a financial hole punched by the recession and the Bernard Madoff scandal.
But if the Rose Art Museum nearly fell off the map, it has now taken a step meant to make the art world take notice. Its first exhibition since 2008 from outside the museum's collection has now opened, featuring an artist from Jerusalem whose work is critical of Israel. 
The artist, Dor Guez, 30, is the son of a Palestinian Christian and a Tunisian-born Jew, and his polemical work largely centers on narrating the experiences of the Arab citizens of Israel, including the way their presence in Israel after the Jewish state was established ''formed an interference in the Zionist master plan.''
At the Istanbul Biennial last year he presented ''Scanograms #2, September 2011,'' an installation that challenged Israel to support the Palestinian bid for statehood at the United Nations. Presenting Palestinian passports from before 1948, accompanied by testimonies in Arabic, it has since been shown in Israel.
When Mr. Guez's work is offered in Israel, it routinely elicits heated responses. At an exhibition last year at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, for example, visitor comments included ''Go to your friends in Gaza,'' and ''Traitor!''
Brandeis is the nation's only nonsectarian Jewish university, and there is scant sympathy on campus for the Palestinian cause, students say. Museum and university officials say that they are not afraid of controversy, having grown accustomed to it during the battle over their thwarted plan to close the Rose.
''We know what we do now will attract lots of attention,'' said Christopher Bedford, the new director of the museum. ''We want to capitalize on that attention.''
Gannit Ankori, a professor of art history at Brandeis and a curator of the Guez show, ''100 Steps to the Mediterranean,'' said Mr. Guez was chosen for the opening exhibition ''because of the exquisite quality of his work, and also because he's challenging.''
Brandeis has described the exhibition as an exploration of ''the overlooked histories of the Christian Palestinian minority in the Middle East,'' though Mr. Guez's work also delves into the experience of Muslim Palestinians.
Savvy students have noticed differences between the Guez pieces shown at Brandeis and more strident work of various Palestinian artists that is sometimes displayed in Israel and elsewhere.
''I do wonder if this was in some sense the safer route to take,'' said Alia Goldfarb, a Brandeis senior.
Rida Abu Rass, a junior from Jaffa who said he was the only Palestinian undergraduate student at the university, agreed.
''It's convenient for Brandeis, because the exhibition is not as out there as it could have been,'' he said. ''So it is not as hard for public relations.''
Nonetheless, ''100 Steps to the Mediterranean,'' which opened on Sept. 20 and runs through Dec. 9, is hard on Israeli Jews.
A video playing on a large screen spanning the back wall of the exhibition is the show's focal point. A rolling image of Jaffa's beachfront fills the screen, while a voice asks: ''Why did the people flee? They were afraid the Jews would do something to them.''
In another piece a college-age relative of the artist speaks to the camera as if it were the screen of a confession booth. ''I grew up with all the songs that any other girl, say Jewish, grows up with,'' she says. ''Sometimes it's really scary to speak Arabic next to all kinds of people, because I'm scared they'll literally beat me up.''
Noam Lekach, a junior from Israel who leads Students for Justice in Palestine, a campus organization that says on its Web site that it wants ''to give a voice to those who are interested in promoting the Palestinian perspective,'' said it is hard to get other Brandeis students to pay attention to that point of view. ''My experience in trying to bring the Palestinian narrative to campus is that people are really resistant to hear about it,'' he said ''They either ignore it or dismiss it as being anti-Semitic or against the existence of Israel.''
A leader of a pro-Israel student group also said he has had little dialogue with ideological rivals. ''I've never had any formal interaction with Students for Justice in Palestine,'' said Joshua Kaye, an organizer for the Brandeis Israel Political Action Committee. ''They've never talked with us and we've never talked with them, even socially.''
So it is perhaps surprising that responses to Mr. Guez's exhibition have been mild.
''You would expect very negative reactions at Brandeis,'' Mr. Lekach said. ''But all of the people I have talked about it with really enjoyed it. Maybe because the show is not too out there, people are willing to discuss it and take it more seriously.''
Members of the university's pro-Israel camp are also visiting the exhibition.
''I'm sure that a lot of people might disagree with the content, but I'm also sure that people think it's very thought-provoking,'' Mr. Kaye said. ''We are still very much figuring out how to talk about these issues.''

HEADLINE: Mortgage Lending Helps JPMorgan Profit Rise 34%

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
Finally moving beyond a trading debacle that has stained his once-stellar reputation, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, on Friday trumpeted a strong quarter of earnings stemming from a surge in mortgage lending.
Mr. Dimon has been fighting to shift attention from a multibillion-dollar trading loss in May that rattled investors, prompted the bank to claw back millions in compensation and attracted the scrutiny of federal law enforcement agents. The latest quarter's profit, up 34 percent, to $5.71 billion, helped do that.
Mr. Dimon, who months ago took a swaggering tone in dismissing the troubled bets and was later forced to be more contrite, struck his usual confident tone on Friday. He emphasized that JPMorgan had contained the fallout from the bungled trade, after closing out the position and limiting the losses to the investment bank of on the remainder of the credit derivative trade. The losses on the bet were $449 million in the third quarter, bringing the total loss to $6.25 billion for the year. 
"Synthetic credit is a sideshow," Mr. Dimon said.
Instead, he pointed to the bank's robust growth across its business units, especially in its mortgage banking unit, which reported a profit increase of 57 percent from a year earlier.
"We believe the housing market has turned the corner," Mr. Dimon said.
Over all, the company's earnings, at $1.40 a share, surpassed Wall Street's estimates. Revenue in the third quarter was $25.9 billion, up 6 percent from the year-ago quarter.
As the nation's largest bank in assets, JPMorgan's performance, especially when rosy, is seized upon as a positive sign for the overall economy. The growth at JPMorgan, particularly in loans to consumers and businesses, could signal broader optimism among Americans and bode well for the housing markets, which have been lurching toward recovery.
"It's a distinctly positive sign," said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Nomura Securities.
The bank also reported that fewer consumers were behind on their credit card bills. Write-offs of soured card loans fell to 3.6 percent, from 4.7 percent the previous year. Those trends echo a pattern across the United States.
In August, delinquencies on credit cards stood at 2.32 percent, according to Moody's Investors Service. That's down from 3.04 a year earlier.
Still, investors in bank stocks remained wary after the earnings announcements of JPMorgan and Wells Fargo on Friday. Shares of JPMorgan declined 48 cents, or 1.14 percent, to $41.62. Investors were spooked, in part, by shrinking net interest margins, which is the profit margin achieved from lending and investing. JPMorgan's net interest margin, for example, dipped to 2.43 percent from 2.66 a year earlier.
At JPMorgan, a glut of deposits is challenging because of persistently low interest rates, which make yields on the bank's investments anemic.
JPMorgan's earnings were buoyed, though, by an increase in mortgage lending, spurred, in part, by exceedingly low interest rates, driven even lower in recent weeks by the Federal Reserve's mortgage bond buying program. New home loans and refinancings at the bank hit $47 billion, up 29 percent from the period a year earlier.
Mr. Dimon tempered his expectations for the market and noted that a large swath of the new originations came from a burst of refinancing activity that would eventually slow down. Refinancings accounted for roughly 75 percent of the quarter's mortgage volume.
He warned, too, that defaults could continue, along with foreclosures, which would most likely leave the bank to shoulder higher costs.
Hitting a familiar tone, Mr. Dimon also remarked that the housing market could rebound more quickly if lawmakers in Washington did less meddling. "I would hope for America's sake we start to fix the things that make the mortgage underwriting too tight," he said on a conference call with reporters.
Throughout its core lending businesses, JPMorgan showed signs of strength. The commercial banking group reported record revenue. The volume of credit card sales jumped 11 percent over the previous year, bolstering the broader unit. The card services and auto business posted profits of $954 million, up 12 percent.
With the improving credit environment, JPMorgan set aside less money to cover potential losses, increasing its profits. In the mortgage banking business, the bank cut the amount of reserves by $900 million. Across the bank, JPMorgan set aside $1.79 billion of such funds, compared with $2.41 billion a year earlier.
Revenue from fixed-income and equity markets remained largely stagnant.
Still, the bank is dogged by investigations that could increase its headaches going forward. In the latest challenge for the bank, federal authorities are building criminal cases related to the trading loss, examining calls in which JPMorgan employees talked about how to value the bets. The Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating the trading losses.
In addition, JPMorgan is facing a lawsuit against Bear Stearns, the troubled unit it now owns. Earlier this month in its first move against a big bank, the federal mortgage task force, co-headed by the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, sued Bear Stearns and its lending unit, claiming it defrauded investors who bought mortgage securities during the housing boom.
In a bid to clean up the bungled trade ahead of its third-quarter earnings, JPMorgan has broadly reshuffled its top executive ranks. For example, Douglas L. Braunstein, the bank's chief financial officer since 2010, is expected to give up his position, but remain at the company. Earlier, Barry Zubrow, who currently heads the bank's regulatory affairs, announced he would resign by the end of the year.
In the second quarter, the bank transferred the remaining credit bets in the chief investment office to its investment banking unit. On Friday, JPMorgan said it "effectively closed" out its derivative position, which was made by Bruno Iksil, the so-called London Whale.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Veeps Go Yeep! Nation Nods.

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
O.K. Forget everything that's happened so far. Now it's all about the next debate.
Obama versus Romney on Tuesday! That will be far more important than the conventions. Or the first debate, which President Obama sort of lost, in a game-changing moment that we are now prepared to completely forget because it's all about the next debate.
Which will be so far more important than the vice-presidential debate that we can hardly bear to mention them in the same paragraph. 
Although that thing on Thursday was pretty cool. Paul Ryan's eyes! Joe Biden's teeth! Paul Ryan's water intake! Can that man hydrate, or what?
The big question seems to be whether Biden was too aggressive or just right. It's true that the vice president interrupted a lot, but, really, he spent the entire run-up week listening to Democrats beg him not to be passive. It's a wonder he didn't run onto the stage and instantly bite Ryan on the ankle.
You think Biden was too feisty? The 2012 record for debate aggression was actually set Thursday night in California, when a uniformed officer broke up a spirited encounter between Representatives Brad Sherman and Howard Berman, who had begun yelling and poking at each other rather vigorously. Perhaps Sherman and Berman were irritated because they are both incumbent Democrats, thrown together by redistricting and California's new nonpartisan election rules. Or perhaps they're just ticked off because their names rhyme. During one high point, Sherman grabbed Berman and shouted: ''Do you want to get into this?''
I think I speak for all of America when I say nothing that interesting happened with the vice-presidential candidates.
The very fact that we have vice-presidential debates at all is kind of amazing, since for most of American history nobody thought they were worth mentioning, let alone listening to. Vice President John Nance Garner said his job wasn't worth a bucket of warm spit, and, by that point, Garner had become so unimportant that nobody remembered whether he actually said ''bucket of warm spit'' or ''pitcher of warm spit'' or a container of something else entirely. Scholarly papers have been written on this mystery.
Quite a few of the vice presidents were men of considerable achievement, for all the good it did them. Calvin Coolidge's vice president, Charles Dawes, was a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize who also composed the music that became the song ''It's All in the Game.'' Does this change your opinion of Calvin Coolidge? No? See, that's my point.
On the other side, there were vice presidents like Schuyler Colfax, who was chosen by Ulysses Grant, then tossed out after the first term because he had been implicated in one of multitudinous corruption scandals going around town. Colfax quit politics and became a popular public speaker until, as one book of White House biographies reports, he died suddenly ''after changing trains in subzero weather during a lecture tour of Minnesota.''
I have often envisioned myself coming to the same end, except that it would involve JetBlue.
The new vice-presidential era began with Bill Clinton, who actually gave Al Gore some stuff to do. Then George W. Bush put Dick Cheney in charge of energy, and foreign policy, and so very many other things that the president had all the time in the world to work out in the gym, watch football with his dog and chop down foliage.
Vice-presidential debates actually go back to 1976, when the world saw a clash between Bob Dole and Walter Mondale that was so riveting that no one now even remembers who they were running with. It's just that once they're over, we don't talk all that much about what happened.
The most quoted line from Thursday's debate in Danville, Ky., may have come when Ryan attempted to defend the theory that if you cut taxes, economic growth will make up for lost revenue. When Ryan said it had worked in the Kennedy administration, Biden retorted: ''Oh, now you're Jack Kennedy.''
Zap! Biden was referring, of course, to the time when Dan Quayle compared himself to Kennedy and Lloyd Bentsen came back with the ''Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy'' line. This turned out to be the most famous vice-presidential debate zinger in history. And a lot of good it did Michael Dukakis.
Like most unremarkable debates, Biden-Ryan wound up being pretty much in the eye of the beholder. The Democratic base felt empowered because Joe Biden brought up Mitt Romney's 47 percent line, and he said ''That didn't happen!'' or ''No, no no ...'' a lot.
The Republicans thought Biden made a spectacle of himself. Sarah Palin claimed he reminded her ''of watching a musk ox run across the tundra with somebody underfoot.'' I am only telling you this because I am still trying to imagine what that would look like. Also to point out that there are exceptions to the rule about how America now takes the vice presidency seriously.

WASHINGTON -- The federal deficit fell to $1.1 trillion in the 2012 fiscal year, down from about $1.3 trillion a year earlier, the Obama administration said on Friday. 
That is the smallest deficit since 2008 but represents the fourth year in a row that the deficit has exceeded $1 trillion. Before the recession, which prompted huge federal spending and large tax cuts, the deficit had never exceeded half a trillion dollars.
The gap between government receipts and government spending -- about 7 percent of economic output in the 2012 fiscal year, down from 8.7 percent in the 2011 fiscal year -- has become a heated election-year political issue.
Republicans have hammered the Obama administration for not doing enough to control deficits and aid growth. ''We've had four budgets, four trillion-dollar deficits,'' Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said during the vice-presidential debate on Thursday evening. ''A debt crisis is coming. We can't keep spending and borrowing like this. We can't keep spending money we don't have.''
Democrats have argued that the economy needs near-term support as well as long-term deficit reduction and have cautioned that too-severe budget cuts would unravel the social safety net.
''The president has put forward a balanced proposal to further strengthen the economy and reduce the country's future deficits,'' Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said in a statement on Friday. ''It is time for Congress to act on these necessary steps that will help create sustainable economic growth for years to come.''
Releasing budget details for the full fiscal year that ran from last October through this September, the Treasury Department and the White House budget office said that the deficit was $238 billion less than it had forecast in the February budget proposal by the White House. Over all, government outlays were $3.5 trillion in the 2012 fiscal year, and receipts totaled about $2.45 trillion.
The shrinking deficit was a result of both higher tax receipts and lower government spending. Government receipts climbed 6.4 percent year-over-year as the economy grew stronger and certain tax breaks expired. Corporate income taxes were a ''major contributor'' to the rise in overall receipts, the administration report said, climbing to $242 billion, from $181 billion in 2011.
Moreover, outlays dropped $61 billion year-over-year because of falling military spending on Afghanistan and Iraq, tapering stimulus spending and the strengthening economy. ''The largest decreases relative to the prior year came from the Department of Defense, unemployment insurance and Medicaid,'' the report said.
The report comes as members of Congress struggle with the so-called fiscal cliff -- huge tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts set to hit next year that might cut the deficit in half but would also risk throwing the country into a recession.

HEADLINE: Germany Resists Call to Give Greece More Time

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Germany held firm on Friday in insisting it was too soon to say that Greece deserved more time to meet its budget-cutting goals, even as the head of the International Monetary Fund laid out the case for leniency.
The slow progress toward debt reform in Greece, Spain and the euro zone was at center stage at the I.M.F.'s meetings in Tokyo, despite Europe's best effort to step out of the spotlight. 
The I.M.F.'s managing director, Christine Lagarde, sitting next to the German finance minister, said Athens needed more breathing space. Given the ''lack of growth, given the market pressure, given the efforts that have been undertaken, a bit more time is necessary,'' she said, amplifying remarks she made Thursday.
In a softening of earlier advice, the I.M.F. has argued that forcing Greece and other debt-burdened countries in Europe to reduce their deficits too quickly would be counterproductive because it would hurt those countries' economies.
The shift was welcomed by some emerging-market countries, as well as by longtime critics who say that the tough conditions attached to I.M.F. loans inflict undue economic pain and make it harder for countries to grow their way out of debt.
''We have been arguing for some time that single-minded and draconian fiscal policies may be counterproductive and have a tendency to backfire,'' said Guido Mantega, the Brazilian finance minister.
But Germany, Europe's largest creditor country and the key to any lasting fiscal reforms, pushed back and said reversing course on promised deficit reductions would weaken credibility.
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble said Europe had made plenty of progress in fighting the crisis, echoing comments from other European officials who said there should be greater attention paid to fiscal troubles in the United States.
He criticized Ms. Lagarde for calling for flexibility even before the ''troika'' of lenders to Athens -- the I.M.F., the European Union and the European Central Bank -- has wrapped up a review of its &#x20ac;130 billion, or $169 billion, bailout program for Greece.
''Until we have the troika report, we must not speculate,'' he said.
Ms. Lagarde and Mr. Schäuble shared the stage as part of a panel discussion, their first public joint appearance since Ms. Lagarde surprised investors on Thursday by stating unequivocally that Greece and Spain needed more time.
The Spanish economy minister, Luis de Guindos, said there was ''absolutely'' no political resistance from within the euro zone to a Spanish bailout request, an apparent reference to Germany. Spain is under pressure to seek a bailout as it struggles to rein in spending by its central government.
U.S. officials have expressed support for giving European countries extra time to deal with their debt.
The I.M.F.'s change of tune on the urgency of budget cuts stems from research it released in the past week showing that aggressive fiscal consolidation crimped growth more sharply than previously thought.
It also reflects a desire by Ms. Lagarde, a former French finance minister, to demonstrate that the I.M.F. is willing to get tough with Europe. Big emerging economies that have helped fill the I.M.F.'s coffers had worried about the organization's independence.
''Let us not delude ourselves: Without growth, the future of the global economy is in jeopardy,'' she said.
''One lesson is clear from history: Reducing public debt is incredibly difficult without growth,'' she said. ''High debt, in turn, makes it harder to get growth
While the I.M.F. had advocated a slower approach to debt reduction, it urged swifter policy action, both in Europe and the United States, to remove economic uncertainty and help lift anaemic global economic growth.
The I.M.F. meetings officially started on a regal note, with the Japanese crown prince in attendance. Ms. Lagarde followed with some blunt warnings for the fund's 188 member countries that they were losing momentum in reforming the global financial system, a running message from the I.M.F. in the buildup to the meeting.
She said it was not much safer than in 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered a global meltdown.
In Europe, the I.M.F. wants to see more progress toward promised reforms that would create a tighter fiscal and banking union.
In the United States, the I.M.F. has sounded the alarm over the ''fiscal cliff'' of automatic spending cuts and tax increases that will take effect early next year unless Congress acts. Without action, the tightening could plunge the U.S. economy back into recession, the I.M.F. said.
''We need to move beyond the system that gave us the crisis -- a financial sector where some, as the ancient Greeks might say, toyed with hubris and unleashed nemesis,'' Ms. Lagarde said.

HEADLINE: Missouree? Missouruh? To Be Politic, Say Both

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON; Dan Gill contributed reporting from Sedalia, Mo.

 BODY:
In Missouri, a perennial swing state with a deeply divided electorate, it has long been one of the politically delicate calculations a candidate can make.
The question is not what position to take on abortion, economic stimulus or health care, though those issues have all proved thorny enough. It is how to pronounce the state name: ''Missouree'' or ''Missouruh''
Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat who is running for re-election, has endured accusations of flip-flopping for using both phrasings at a virtual one-to-one ratio, sometimes in the same sentences, a trait that prompted a former spokesman to call him ''oratorically ambidextrous.''
His opponent, Dave Spence, a Republican businessman, said he is more consistent, exclusively using the Missouree pronunciation. But the campaign has also hedged: a biographical video features his wife saying ''he's going to be a great governor for the state of Missouruh.'' 
Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat in one of the most closely watched Senate races, typically uses Missouree in her advertisements. But when outside conservative groups sponsored attack ads in February, her campaign responded with spots that use the other pronunciation.
The campaign of Todd Akin, the Republican congressman running against her, called using both pronunciations ''cheesy'' even though he has waffled himself, saying ''Missouruh has a choice'' when he announced his candidacy.
And the differences extend to the top of the ticket. Mitt Romney, who is favored to win Missouri, asked the crowd at a campaign event in the state during the primary race, ''How many say Missouree like I do?'' President Obama has favored Missouruh in his appearances.
The debate serves as a low-stakes case study for the age-old art of political pandering -- that alternately endearing and condescending process of cultivating the ''just like you'' appeal that remains a central part of running for office. Other linguistic examples include presidential candidates dropping g's before Southern audiences or changing the cadence of their speech before black audiences.
There are states where locals cringe at mangling by outsiders or where regional accents signal deep local roots (New Yawk and Loo-si-ana) but Missouri is the only state where there is fundamental, if mostly good natured, disagreement about saying the state's name.
Scholars believe the name Missouri -- however it is pronounced -- comes from a word the Illinois Indians used to describe a neighboring tribe: ''one who has a canoe.'' But historical reasons for the split have been a matter of considerable debate among linguists and historians.
Some believe it started as an east-west split, with St. Louis favoring ''ee'' and Kansas City ''uh.'' Popular belief holds that the southern half of the state is "Missourah," with Highway 70 serving as a sort of Mason-Dixon line, and still others contend that ''Missouree'' is city, ''Missouruh'' is country.
Increasingly, however, the divide is not geographical but generational.
''The Missouruh pronunciation carries a degree of stigma as incorrect or at least old-fashioned,'' said Matthew Gordon, an associate professor of English who studies linguistics at the University of Missouri. ''So many young people may avoid it even if they come from families in which the older generations used that pronunciation.''
Yet there is one demographic group that cannot seem to scrub the Missouruh name from their speech.
''A high percentage of our politicians say Missouruh,'' mused Lyle Anderson, the mayor of Lebanon, who prefers the other construction.
Such politicians include, historically, President Harry S. Truman, a Democrat, and more recently, former Senators John Ashcroft and Christopher S. Bond, both Republicans. Today, most of the state's top officials stick mostly to ''Missouree,'' but they sprinkle the other ending into the occasional speech, especially when they're introducing themselves or speaking to rural audiences. Strategists say that's just good Missouri manners.
''It's almost like a courtesy, when you're in somebody else's home, to relate to them,'' said Steve Glorioso, a Democratic consultant in Kansas City who has advised those on the stump to adjust the pronunciations to match the audiences.
Jeff Roe, a longtime Republican operative in the state, said he has never discussed pronunciation with a Missourian candidate, but advises those from out of state: ''Stay safe and say Missouruh.'' (Indeed, in the Senate race, most of the television ads using the soft vowel, known to linguists as a schwa, come from national political action committees.)
Mr. Nixon, a moderate Democrat, whose policy positions sometimes reflect the same try-to-please-everyone approach as his use of the state name, is favored to win a second term. And in one of the country's most competitive Senate races, Ms. McCaskill has struggled to pull away from Mr. Akin, despite his comments about ''legitimate rape.'' There have been occasional, fruitless, efforts to end the debate over the state name. In 1907, a resolution introduced in the state House to establish the ''only true pronunciation as that received by the native Indians'' -- a third way, Mih-SOO-rih -- failed by voice vote. In 1970, Gov. Warren E. Hearnes announced to some fanfare that both pronunciations are correct. In 2002, as secretary of state, Matt Blunt polled visitors at the Missouri State Fair about how to say the state name, with Missouree winning in a landslide.
It remains unclear what, if any, weight voters put on hearing their preferred pronunciation of the state's name. Many Missourians insist they couldn't care less. But politicians rarely turn down an opportunity for an edge.
Ms. McCaskill, who was mocked years ago for recording separate campaign advertisements for different parts of the state that featured the different pronunciations, still switches back and forth. But her campaign was eager to pass off the changes as accidental, releasing a statement saying she ''always'' used both. ''Over-thinking it just gets you into trouble, so we don't,'' the statement said. ''It all comes naturally.'' Governor Nixon, meanwhile, endured some gentle chiding after his inauguration, when he pledged to defend ''the Constitution of the state of Missouree'' and the ''office of governor of the state of Missouruh.'' He jokingly acknowledges that he can't keep it straight.''When you spend as much time as Governor Nixon does in every corner of the state,'' said Sam Murphey, a spokesman, ''you really don't pay much attention to this sort of thing.''
His Republican challenger, Mr. Spence, disagreed: ''People can see through insincerity from about 150 yards.'' He added that he would never change his ''Missouree'' pronunciation for political gain.
But he confessed that he only realized that his wife of 22 years said ''Missouruh'' after his campaign began.
''I'd never even noticed that she did that,'' Mr. Spence said.

HEADLINE: New Front in Race as Republicans Seize On Libya

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and TRIP GABRIEL; Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Trip Gabriel from Richmond, Va.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration's handling of the Libya attack has opened a new front in the presidential campaign just weeks before Election Day as Republicans seize on it to question the president's performance as commander in chief.
The dispute over the episode escalated after Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said during the debate on Thursday night that ''we weren't told'' that Americans in Libya wanted security bolstered, despite Congressional testimony that the administration had turned down requests. Mitt Romney's campaign on Friday accused the vice president of trying ''to mislead the American public.'' 
The conflicting statements over security came after the administration's fluctuating assessments of the attack on the diplomatic post in Benghazi that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. For President Obama, who had counted on foreign policy as a political strength, the issue has put him on the defensive, while Republicans who had focused on the economy now see a chance to undercut his credibility with the public on national security.
In a sense, the issue goes beyond foreign policy, which has not been a top priority for voters this year, polls show. Instead, Republicans are framing the matter as a larger indictment of Mr. Obama's leadership and transparency, presenting him as unable to create enough jobs at home or protect American interests abroad, while trying to shift the blame to others. Democrats counter by accusing Republicans of politicizing a national tragedy.
Mr. Romney wasted little time in criticizing the vice president for contradicting testimony about security concerns in Libya. ''He's doubling down on denial,'' Mr. Romney said during a rally in Richmond, Va. ''And we need to understand exactly what happened, as opposed to just having people brush this aside. When the vice president of the United States directly contradicts the testimony, sworn testimony, of State Department officials, American citizens have a right to know just what's going on, and we're going to find out.''
Two officials in charge of security in Libya told a House committee this week that they asked for more security officers but were rebuffed by the State Department. Asked about that on Thursday night during his debate with Representative Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Romney's running mate, Mr. Biden said: ''We weren't told they wanted more security again. We did not know they wanted more security again.''
The White House tried to explain Mr. Biden's comments by saying that diplomatic security requests were handled by the State Department, not the White House. ''The vice president was speaking about himself, the president and the White House,'' said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary. ''He was not referring to the administration.''
Mr. Carney was pressed repeatedly by reporters to explain what the president and the vice president knew and when they knew it, but he declined to answer in detail. Mr. Carney would not say whether Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden were specifically informed about the security concerns in Libya.
Mr. Carney accused Republicans of hypocrisy for voting against diplomatic security spending, singling out Mr. Ryan. ''I find it rich that charges are made about concern over diplomatic security by those who routinely slash funding for diplomatic security to pay for tax cuts,'' he said.
The government spent $2.43 billion on diplomatic security in the 2010 fiscal year, when Democrats last controlled both houses of Congress. The figure then fell to $2.29 billion in 2011 before rising to $2.37 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. The administration asked for $2.84 billion for 2013, but House Republicans whittled that down to $2.62 billion. A State Department official testified that the budget played no role in deciding on security in Libya.
Mr. Biden was expecting tough questions in the debate about the Benghazi attack and security concerns at the American mission there, according to people familiar with his preparation. But he still seemed caught off guard when the moderator, Martha Raddatz of ABC News, pressed him on whether American diplomats had requested additional security in Libya.
Senior administration officials said Mr. Biden's answer was accurate because while the embassy in Tripoli requested an extension of duty for 13 military or diplomatic security officers -- which the State Department denied -- it did not request additional guards for the mission in Benghazi. Moreover, they said, the request did not reach the White House.
The Libya attack has risen to the forefront of the campaign even as other foreign policy issues, like the war in Afghanistan and the building confrontation with Iran, have remained secondary topics. The administration at first attributed the deaths of Mr. Stevens and the others to an opportunistic attack during protests against an anti-Islam film. Officials eventually termed the assault a terrorist attack tied to Qaeda sympathizers and played down the protest angle.
''First they blame a YouTube video and a nonexistent riot,'' Mr. Ryan told supporters in Lancaster, Ohio. ''Then when the country's getting upset about it, they blame Romney and Ryan for getting people upset about it.''
How much the issue has influenced voters remains uncertain. Approval of Mr. Obama's handling of foreign policy fell from 54 percent in August to 49 percent last month after the Benghazi attack, while disapproval rose from 40 percent to 46 percent, according to a survey by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal at the end of September.
At the same time, Republicans are focusing attention on national security even as they worry that the economy may not offer as much traction as they once thought. Polls have shown some increasing optimism about the economy as unemployment has fallen to 7.8 percent, the lowest it has been during Mr. Obama's presidency.
Mr. Romney ratcheted up his criticism of the president over Benghazi all week, but he has intentionally stayed one or two steps behind fiercer Republican critics in Congress, his advisers said. He has not joined Congressional Republicans in accusing the administration of playing down a terrorist link to the attack to save the president from embarrassment close to the election.
The campaign wants to avoid a repetition of its first hasty response to the attack, when Mr. Romney accused the administration of apologizing to protesters, a statement widely criticized as irresponsible. Mr. Romney began the week with a foreign policy speech at Virginia Military Institute that was intended to offer a reset on his credibility as a commander in chief. The effort will continue at the second presidential debate on Tuesday, the first time foreign policy will be a topic between him and Mr. Obama.

HEADLINE: New Parks Chief Is a Voice for Expansion

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Maybe it was the experience of growing up in a family with 12 children in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, that propelled Veronica M. White outdoors and fostered a passion for parkland. Shore Road Park, with its sweeping views of New York Bay and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, became Ms. White's extended backyard.
''That's where I learned to play baseball and basketball and where I learned how to ride a bike,'' said Ms. White, who took over as head of the Department of Parks and Recreation last month, replacing the longtime commissioner, Adrian Benepe. ''Parkland is the reason people want to be in New York and stay in New York. It affects every New Yorker,'' she said. 
Ms. White, 53, applied for the top parks job once before, shortly after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was elected in 2001. But Mr. Benepe, then a parks administrator, was named commissioner instead; he stepped down this year to join the Trust for Public Land, a nonprofit group, in a recent exodus of officials as the mayor enters his final year in office.
A relative outsider to the parks department, Ms. White is not new to city government. An environmental lawyer by training, she most recently served as the first executive director of the Center for Economic Opportunity, which was created in 2006 under Mr. Bloomberg to find innovative ways to address poverty. Before that, she held positions at the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development; her public service reaches all the way back to the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch.
Ms. White, who now lives on Central Park West, said she knew that the clock on her ''dream job,'' as she calls it, was ticking. And she has quickly immersed herself in the department's vast system of 1,700 parks, 500 community gardens and 14 miles of beaches, while setting out to solidify the capital projects and initiatives undertaken in the past decade.
Under Mayor Bloomberg, several expansive parks and environmental projects were either started or nudged forward, including Governors Island, Freshkills Park on Staten Island, the High Line on the West Side of Manhattan, and Brooklyn Bridge Park along the East River. There has been a push to open up the waterfront, with newly developed piers and esplanades, in all five boroughs. The city has also pledged to plant a million trees, and is nearly two thirds of the way toward that goal.
On a recent outing to Randalls Island, where the parks department oversees 63 ball fields and an experimental rooftop garden, Ms. White talked about her tenure. ''It's 15 months and I'm going to squeeze in a lot,'' she said, surveying garden herbs. ''It's the best job in the world, and I'll make the most of it.''
She is especially committed to seeing through the plans for eight regional sites that were singled out in the mayor's blueprint for sustainability called PlaNYC, including McCarren Park Pool in Brooklyn and Soundview Park in the Bronx. The properties received an injection of $290 million, allowing the city to tackle large, complicated restorations that had lain fallow for years.
Among them is the planned restoration of High Bridge, a 1,200-foot-long pedestrian bridge linking the southwest Bronx to Upper Manhattan that has been closed for 40 years. The project is expected to cost $62 million.
And Ms. White, who oversees 3,500 full-time employees, said she would make sure the department continued to look for opportunities to acquire new parkland. Under the Bloomberg administration, the city has added 737 acres, bringing its total parkland to 29,000 acres. Some have criticized the city for the expansion of parks, saying it should focus instead on better maintaining the existing ones. Maintenance budgets have been cut in recent years.
But while the department recently hired a consulting firm to study its approach to park maintenance, Ms. White said she believed that securing new open space for future generations was paramount. ''You don't get a second bite of the apple,'' she said. ''The boroughs aren't getting any bigger. If the land is available, we need to seize the opportunity.''
Park advocates say Ms. White's involvement in disadvantaged communities will ensure that the department's resources are spread fairly and evenly in the city. ''There's a lot of optimism about her background and experience,'' said Holly M. Leicht, executive director of New Yorkers for Parks, a nonprofit group. ''She's worked in low-income areas and a lot of different neighborhoods, and the hope is that she will have a very expansive view of the park system.''
Ms. White could remain in her position after Mr. Bloomberg leaves office. The former parks commissioner Henry J. Stern served 14 years, straddling three administrations. If Ms. White does have more than 15 months of sway over parks, she will most likely put a special focus on the environment. She said she particularly wanted to introduce recycling bins in parks and spread the word about green roofs.
''They're good for the environment and good for people's health and good for eating habits,'' she said. Asked if her apartment building on the Upper West Side had one, she said, ''Not yet.'' But her smile seemed to suggest that it would not be long.

HEADLINE: Foreigners and the Burden of Debt

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Not the story people think. 

 BODY:
A number of comments on my non-burden of the debt post were along the lines of "But what if the debt is owed to foreigners?" OK, this takes a bit more thinking.
Another thought experiment: suppose that for some reason the Chinese and a bunch of domestic investors do an asset swap: the Chinese sell off $500 billion of Treasuries and buy an equal amount of, say, corporate bonds, while the domestic investors do the reverse. Has America become any richer (or any poorer)? Obviously not -- as a nation we still owe the same amount to the rest of the world.
What this tells us is that when we're trying to assess the burden or lack thereof of debt, foreign ownership of government debt doesn't really matter. What does matter is our net international investment position, the value of the overseas assets owned by all domestic residents minus the value of all domestic assets owned by foreign residents..
Now, this ties right in with what Brad said about the burden of the debt: we'd all agree that deficits make us poorer if they crowd out investment spending -- which they would if the economy were near full employment, but won't if we're deeply depressed. All we have to do is realize that net foreign investment -- purchases minus sales of assets from and to foreigners -- is also a form of investment. Or to put it a bit more simply, sure, budget deficits can make us poorer as a nation if they lead to bigger trade deficits.
So far, nothing like this has happened. Here's the U.S. budget deficit (all levels of government) and the current account deficit, both as a percentage of GDP:
U.S. borrowing from abroad is way down, not up, in recent years.
Still, you could argue that a bigger budget deficit would, other things equal, lead to a bigger trade deficit -- because it would expand the economy and lead to higher imports. (This is in contrast to business investment, which is almost surely crowded in, not out, by deficits under current conditions). So in this very limited sense you could tell a burden of deficits story. But surely it's not what debt alarmists have in mind: "Hey, deficit spending could bring us back to prosperity, which might lead to more imports, so let's not go there!"
The bottom line is that while foreign ownership of U.S. assets -- not just government debt -- is a complication, the common claim that deficits mean that we're selling our birthright to the Chinese makes no sense at all.
So far

HEADLINE: Race, 'Holistic Admissions' and U.C.L.A.

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Are admissions officers illegally taking race into account - or legally going to extra lengths to reward students for having overcome disadvantage, which happens to benefit black and Latino students? 

 BODY:
After the state of California banned racial preferences in 1996, the University of California, Los Angeles, began taking several steps to encourage more black and Latino students to apply. The goal was ensuring that U.C.L.A.'s student body remained racially diverse even without affirmative action.
Among the steps, U.C.L.A. increased the number of academic-preparation sessions for local high school students. The students who attend these sessions are able to note their participation on their applications if they later apply to U.C.L.A., which would signal their academic seriousness.
A few years ago, Richard H. Sander, a U.C.L.A. law professor, began digging into the college admissions data, partly to see if it was abiding by the 1996 ban, and he discovered a strange pattern, as I mentioned in my column this weekend.
Mr. Sander argues that the pattern shows that U.C.L.A. is violating the state's ban on race-based affirmative action. U.C.L.A. officials strongly disagree and say they are simply taking into account disadvantage, which is more common among black and Latino students.
The dispute is particularly relevant now, given the pending Supreme Court case on affirmative action. If the justices further restrict or ban the use of race-based affirmative action, more universities will most likely find themselves embroiled in debates like the one at U.C.L.A.: Are admissions officers illegally taking race into account - or legally going to extra lengths to reward students for having overcome disadvantage, which happens to benefit black and Latino students? 
To understand the issues at U.C.L.A., you need to first know about its system of "holistic admissions."
For every applicant, the admissions office assigns a holistic score, which boils down the applicant's qualifications by taking into account test scores, grades, extracurricular activities and the obstacles a student has overcome. About 98 percent students with a score of 1 or 1.5 are admitted. About 72 percent of students with a 2.5 score are admitted. Less than 5 percent of students with a score of 3.5 or higher are admitted.
Mr. Sander has found that black and Latino students with midrange "holistic scores" have been significantly more likely to win admission than white and Asian students with the same score.
Black and Latino students who attended an outreach session - whose race could have become known to U.C.L.A., even though the application does not ask about race - have been accepted at even higher rates.
"My guess is that this happened because some admissions officers only knew about the race of applicants by virtue of their participation in outreach sessions," says Mr. Sander, who is an author, with Stuart Taylor Jr., of a new book critical of affirmative action, called "Mismatch." The preferences that the admissions office is giving, Mr. Sander argues, are "on a substantial scale."
Among applicants with a holistic score of 2.75, for example, 33 percent of black applicants were admitted, while 30 percent of Latino applicants were, about 17 percent of Asian applicants were and 11 percent of white applicants were, according to Mr. Sander.
Among black applicants who had a 2.75 score and attended one of the college's outreach sessions, the acceptance rate was 43 percent. Among black applicants with the same score who did not attend a session, the acceptance rate was 23 percent. For white and Asian students with midrange scores, the gaps between applicants who attended outreach sessions and those who did not were lower.
When I asked U.C.L.A. officials about the pattern, they said that racial preferences played no role. The holistic scores are meant to take into account the obstacles that students have overcome, but the scores are not definitive, said Youlonda Copeland-Morgan, associate vice chancellor for enrollment management.
For difficult calls - when a student hovers on the line between admission and rejection - admissions officers will look more closely at a student's file and his or her background can make the ultimate difference, Ms. Copeland-Morgan said; she does not consider it surprising, therefore, that black and Latino students with a given holistic score would have a higher acceptance rate.
Similarly, U.C.L.A officials said they were not surprised that students who took the initiative to attend an outreach session had a higher acceptance rate than others with a similar score.
If you're interested in more detail about the debate, you can read Mr. Sander's book. You can also read the Mare report, by the U.C.L.A. sociology professor Robert Mare, which appeared in May and found that the holistic admissions system was working as intended. Intriguingly, both Mr. Sander and U.C.L.A. argue that the Mare report is consistent with their findings.

HEADLINE: Cedar Lake Ballet Makes a Brief, Well-Chosen Stop at Sadler's Wells

BYLINE: ROSLYN SUCLAS


HIGHLIGHT: When Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet was founded in New York in 2003 by the Walmart heiress Nancy Laurie, it was generally regarded in the dance world as a rich woman's folly. So much for the naysayers: The company has developed a reputation as the purveyor of new and interesting European choreography. 

 BODY:
LONDON - When Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet was founded in New York in 2003 by the Walmart heiress Nancy Laurie, it was generally regarded in the dance world as a rich woman's folly. Ms. Laurie hired dancers and a director, and later bought the photographer Annie Leibowitz's former studios and transformed them into a state-of-the-art black box theater, rehearsal and office space. But for a few years no one heard much about the company, and the naysayers muttered that Ms. Laurie would soon lose interest.
 But on Thursday night, Cedar Lake opened a short season at Sadler's Wells, the company's debut on a major international stage, and received a warm response from a pretty-much-full house. The change in fortunes has been slow and steady; for the last few years, Cedar Lake has developed a reputation as the purveyor of new and interesting European choreography - a genre that for reasons of both taste and economic constraint, isn't much seen in American company repertories.
 It's a clever artistic decision on the part of the company's director, Benoît-Swan Pouffer, who joined Cedar Lake as its resident choreographer in 2005 and was promoted to artistic director the following year. Mr. Pouffer is French, although most of his dancing career was spent with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Company in New York. But he remained connected to the European scene, and given a chance to work with a secure budget that would allow him to take risks, he seized it, commissioning pieces from choreographers like Ohad Naharin, Jacopo Godani, Alexander Ekman, Didy Veldman, Hofesh Shechter, Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, and other rising stars of the European dance scene whose work rarely makes it to New York.
 For the company's London debut, Mr. Pouffer chose pieces by Mr. Shechter ("Violet Kid"), Mr. Ekman ("Tuplet") and Ms. Pite ("Grace Engine"), all of whom are to some extent familiar to British audiences. It's a very good program, offering a taste of Mr. Shechter's intense physicality, Mr. Ekman's quirky vocabulary and Ms. Pite's poetic, lyrical qualities.
 "Violet Kid" is a large-scale, full-company affair, similar in some ways to other works by Mr. Shechter in which the group, with its tribal unison, its military formations and its almost fascist uniformity, is pitted again the vulnerable individual. Again and again in Mr. Shechter's work are images of a lone figure or two breaking away from or out of a semi-hypnotized group, but the choreographer's skill in weaving these moments seamlessly together keeps the emotional trajectory unpredictable and occasionally harrowing. Mr. Shechter is a composer too, and the music-in part a string trio set high up at the back of the stage, in part a driving electronic score - plays an integral part in the intense world of movement and sound conjured onstage.
 Mr. Ekman's "Tuplet" is a fairly lightweight affair, but it shows his talent for dry humor as its six dancers move through undulating, snaking, collapsing movements with jerky precision, to a score that is partly made up of their voices and the percussive effects of their bodies. It's fun - and there is a remarkable male solo from Jonathan Bond at the outset - but it feels disposable against Mr. Hofesh and Ms. Pite's more substantial work.
 Ms. Pite was a member of William Forsythe's Frankfurt Ballett for several years, and Mr. Forsythe's complex, coordinated style is evident in her vocabulary, which uses ballet alongside a broader range of movement. In "Grace Engine," set to a melancholy score by Owen Belton, overlaid by train sounds and haunting footsteps, she creates a series of scenes that suggest a multiplicity of narratives, or perhaps memories. There are groups and tableaus that suddenly reveal solos and duets; strange moments of recognition and departure; a suggestion of death and loss at the end. It's a haunting, atmostpheric piece that has overtones of a ghost story, perhaps even a thriller, and it shows the Cedar Lake dancers brilliantly capturing the dissolving, twisting movement that inflects her choreography.

HEADLINE: Oct. 13: Arizona and the Spanish-Speaking Vote

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Apart from the tracking polls, the only survey published as of our deadline on Saturday was one in Arizona. It had a surprising result, showing Mr. Obama 2 points ahead among likely voters. 

 BODY:
President Obama halted an 8-day winning streak for Mitt Romney in the FiveThirtyEight forecast on Saturday, with his chances of winning the Electoral College ticking up to 62.9 percent from 61.1 percent on Friday.
 One should be careful about making too much of this: Mr. Romney has made very strong gains in the forecast over the past week-and-a-half to draw the race nearly even. It is unlikely that there will be a major change in the landscape until Tuesday's debate in New York.
However, the polls have shifted so much toward Mr. Romney in recent days that a mediocre day of polling for Mr. Obama may look good to the model in comparison to a very poor one, as he had on Friday.
Three of the four national tracking polls on Saturday, from Gallup, Rasmussen Reports, and Investors' Business Daily, showed no change in their results among likely voters, although Mr. Obama gained one point in the version of the Gallup poll among registered voters. Mr. Obama did improve his margin by roughly one point in the online poll published by the RAND Corporation.
In general, the tracking polls have been slightly more favorable to Mr. Obama than other national surveys since the debate. The RAND Corporation poll has him leading by roughly 3 points, while the Investors' Business Daily has him up by less than a full percentage point. 
In the Rasmussen Reports poll and the Gallup poll of registered voters, Mr. Obama's numbers are not far from their long-term averages, although that partly reflects methodological changes in each survey.
A note on this topic: My preference would be that polling firms did not change their methods so close to the election. Even if the changes are helpful to their accuracy in the long run, they make it harder to measure the trend in the race against a constant baseline. There are some changes that I'd like to make to the FiveThirtyEight forecast -- for instance, in making it more aggressive about responding to news events like debates -- and I'll tell you when I think it may be doing something wrong. But I'm going to save those for 2016. I think the value of an objective method is undermined if one changes the rules in midstream.
Still, things were at least not getting worse for Mr. Obama in the tracking polls. We'll know soon enough whether this reflects a dead-cat bounce or the beginning of a rebound.
 A Surprising Poll in Arizona 
Apart from the tracking polls, the only survey published as of our deadline on Saturday was one in Arizona. It had a surprising result, showing Mr. Obama 2 points ahead among likely voters.
The survey has a couple of things in its favor. The poll comes from a firm, the Behavior Research Center, that has had good results in the past. And almost all of its interviews postdated the Denver debate.
But I would not be too worried about the topline numbers if I were Mr. Romney's campaign -- or too enthralled with them if I were Mr. Obama's. The survey contacted relatively few respondents -- about 500 voters -- and even a good polling firm can and will produce an outlying result or two with a sample size like that.
It is plausible that Mr. Obama could win Arizona if he is running strongly nationwide -- but it is much less likely that he will do so in the current national environment, where the race is almost tied.
Consider that, in 2008, Mr. Obama lost Arizona by 8 points despite winning nationally by 7 points.
Part of that is because Arizona was John McCain's home state. Historically, the home-state advantage for a candidate is on the order of 7 points. In other words, had Mr. McCain been from another state, Arizona might have been a toss-up in 2008.
Even so, that was an in election in which Mr. Obama had a clear victory nationwide. If Mr. Obama recovers from his debate swoon and wins another clear victory this November, Arizona could fall into his column. But it is unlikely to prove decisive in a tight national race.
The FiveThirtyEight forecast model considers what we call "state fundamentals" along with the polls -- with the most important fundamental factor simply being how the state voted in recent elections. (The model incorporates an adjustment for home-state effects in Arizona and other states that were home to one of the candidates.)
When there is abundant polling in a state, the polls predominate in the forecast. But in a sparsely-polled state, like Arizona, the fundamentals have more influence.
Our research has shown that this will usually produce a more accurate forecast, reducing the risk of banking too much on potential outlier polls. In 2004, a pair of late polls showed George W. Bush just ahead of John Kerry in Hawaii -- an implausible-seeming result given that the national race was fairly close and that Hawaii is ordinarily very Democratic-leaning.
Indeed, Mr. Kerry eventually won Hawaii by 9 points, despite a late visit there by then-Vice President Dick Cheney.
Thus, the forecast still makes Mr. Romney the clear favorite in Arizona. We will need to see more polls of Arizona, or a rebound for Mr. Obama nationally, for that story to change much. (Arizona could certainly use more high-quality polling. Although there is only an outside chance that it will influence the presidential race, the senate race there is highly competitive and a loss in the state would make it very hard for Republicans to win control of the Senate.)
 Are Polls Underestimating Obama's Hispanic Vote? 
However, there is a potentially troubling aspect of the poll for Mr. Romney. The Behavior Research Center conducted interviews in Spanish along with English. That may account for some of why it had better results for Mr. Obama than other surveys of the state.
In the past couple of elections, polls have underestimated Democrats' standing in states with heavy Hispanic populations. (The two senate races that the FiveThirtyEight forecast called incorrectly in 2010 -- Nevada and Colorado -- are both states with a healthy number of Hispanic voters.)
This may be because many polling firms that conduct interviews only in English miss some Hispanic voters who are more comfortable speaking Spanish. According to Matt Barreto of the polling firm Latino Decisions, which conducts bilingual interviews, primarily Spanish-speaking Hispanic voters are more likely to vote Democratic than those who have more English fluency.
Polling firms such as Latino Decisions that have conducted interviews in Spanish have shown Mr. Obama with a larger advantage among Hispanic voters than those which interview in English only. The most recent Latino Decisions poll, for example, had Mr. Obama ahead 72-20 among Hispanic voters. This poll is not an outlier; other polling firms that have conducted Spanish-language interviews have found similar results.
The countervailing factor is that Hispanics who speak mostly Spanish are unlikely to be registered or likely to vote. Still, this factor could make some difference in states with heavy Hispanic populations, like Arizona.
How much of an impact might this make? On Saturday, I ran an alternate version of the FiveThirtyEight simulation in which I assumed that Mr. Obama would in fact win Hispanic voters by 50 percentage points, his edge in the Latino Decisions poll, as opposed to the roughly 35-point margin he's had on average in polls that were conducted in English only.
I scaled this adjustment based on the share of Hispanic voters in 2008 exit polls. So, for example, Mr. Obama gained a net of 3 points in Texas because of the adjustment, but almost nothing in Kentucky.
Even with this adjustment, Mr. Obama was far from being favored in Arizona. Instead, the model gave him just an 8 percent chance of winning there, although this was better than the 4 percent chance from the standard FiveThirtyEight model.
However, the adjustment increased Mr. Obama's win probability in Colorado to 57 percent from 44 percent, in Florida to 53 percent from 35 percent, and in Nevada to 77 percent from 62 percent. It even helped him slightly in Virginia, where about 5 percent of voters identified as Hispanic in 2008 exit polls.
Overall, Mr. Obama's chances of winning the Electoral College rose to 69 percent from 63 percent.
More of the Hispanic population is concentrated in noncompetitive states like Texas, California and New York. Thus, the increase in Mr. Obama's Electoral College win probability was slightly smaller than increase in his probability of winning the popular vote, which rose to 71 percent from 61 percent.
This adjustment is speculative -- as I mentioned, it isn't clear how many primarily Spanish-speaking Hispanics will actually turn out to vote. And a few surveys do conduct interviews in Spanish.
I recommend the regular FiveThirtyEight model as providing the best overall forecast of the state of the race. There might be ways in which the polls could be underestimating Mr. Obama's vote -- but there are potentially other ways in which the surveys might be biased against Mr. Romney.
Still it's the possibility that the polls are underestimating Mr. Obama's performance among Hispanics that should be the concern for Mr. Romney in the Arizona poll -- not the unlikely possibility that Arizona has suddenly become a swing state.

HEADLINE: The Weekend Word: Up for Debate

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, the president's weekly address, and a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 
How the Obama administration handled the attack on an American consulate in Libya has become a top issue in the presidential campaign, Peter Baker and Trip Gabriel write. Debate flared up after the vice-presidential debate in which Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. seemed to contradict official statements by the White House and the State Department about the event.
President Obama's aides say he will give a "passionate and energetic" follow-up on Tuesday to his debate performance in Denver, but not a repeat of Mr. Biden's debate styleon Thursday against Representative Paul D. Ryan, his Republican rival. Michael D. Shear writes that while conservatives took offense at Mr. Biden's performance, Democrats praised him for giving the vigorous defense they had expected from Mr. Obama.
In a suburban Cleveland House race that is one of the most crucial and expensive contests in the country, the two Republican incumbents running against each other believe they aren't being heard. Jonathan Weisman explains that Representatives James B. Renacci and Betty Sutton blame a barrage of negative ads blanketing the airwaves in greater Cleveland for drowning out their competing messages.
Voters in Maryland and Washington State could be easy prey for hackers seeking to disenfranchise them after computer security experts identified vulnerabilities in the states' voter databases. Nicole Perlroth explains that the experts and voting rights advocates argue that it would be relatively simple for hackers to use publicly available information to disenfranchise an individual voter or a large bloc of them. But state officials say the concerns are exaggerated.
In Missouri, everyone seeking office - from Gov. Jay Nixon to Senator Claire McCaskill, even President Obama - has to make a political calculation about whether to call the state "Missouree" or "Missourah." Sarah Wheaton writes that how one pronounces the state's name can carry as much political heft as the positions one takes on the economy and social issues.
 The President's Weekly Address: 
The turnaround of the automotive industry features prominently in President Obama's weekly address. Without referring to his Republican rival by name, Mr. Obama reminds voters that Mitt Romney and other Republicans opposed Mr. Obama's decision to bail out American car makers, who now sell the most cars in the world. Mr. Obama also highlighted the positive effects of higher fuel standards and free trade agreements on the middle class.
 Happening in Washington: 
Starting Saturday, the White House will offer a week of fall garden tours for the public. The tour covers the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, the Rose Garden, the South Lawn and the White House Kitchen Garden.

HEADLINE: An Unusual Fund-Raising Pitch in Massachusetts

BYLINE: KATHARINE Q. SEELYE


HIGHLIGHT: Elizabeth Warren's campaign manager sent out a request for donations prompted by nothing more than a similar request from Scott Brown, her opponent. The Warren e-mail reprints the Brown e-mail in its entirety. 

 BODY:
BOSTON -- The fund-raising competition between Senator Scott P. Brown and Elizabeth Warren, his Democratic challenger, may have finally jumped the shark.
Both campaigns have used the flimsiest of excuses to send out fund-raising appeals in their ferociously competitive Massachusetts Senate race. Their efforts have made their race the most expensive in the country in this election cycle.
Now the Warren campaign has taken creative fund-raising to new heights. On Friday, the Warren campaign manager, Mindy Myers, sent out an appeal prompted by nothing more than a Brown appeal.
This may be a first in fund-raising. The Warren e-mail reprints the Brown e-mail in its entirety -- even as it denigrates Ms. Warren.
The reprint is so complete that it starts with the same subject line at the top ("Character counts and issues matter") and goes all the way to the bottom, where it helpfully includes the "donate" button on which to click to make a contribution to Mr. Brown.
The point, according to Ms. Myers' letter, is to show how "desperate" Mr. Brown is.
"Scott Brown's poll numbers are plummeting," Ms. Myers' e-mail begins. "He lost the third debate on Wednesday."
"Want to see the email of someone who's desperate?" her letter goes on. "Read below. Thanks for all you're doing. Keep it up!" It then includes a "donate" button to send contributions to Ms. Warren.
But if donors are sick of appeals from the Warren campaign, the Warren campaign could not have made it easier for them to turn around and contribute to Mr. Brown.
Here is the Brown letter, as reprinted in Ms. Myers' e-mail:
Friends,
Character counts and issues matter. You know all about Professor Warren's elusive heritage, evasive answers and defensive double-talk that strike at the heart of her character.
Where she stands on the issues is just as important, and Elizabeth Warren always checks the box for bigger government and higher taxes.
Voters saw us side-by-side at the Springfield debate and saw that Elizabeth Warren's solution to every problem is higher taxes. 
If she wins, you lose because she's for new and higher taxes on Social Security, Medicare and small businesses. She talks about 'investing,' but what she means is taking your hard-earned dollars and spending them on new, big government programs.
I have added up her tax hikes and they will cost us $3.4 trillion over the next ten years. Talk about punishing taxes! They will hit you and our economy like a sledgehammer. I need your help to get the word out by contributing online right now.
There are only 25 days left so let's get right to it. Professor Warren's campaign is flush with campaign cash from the national liberals and Hollywood elite who agree with her and think we need higher taxes.
Will you back me up? Help me raise the funds I urgently need to convey just how dangerously out of touch Professor Warren is on the serious issues of the day. Your online help is vital to our victory. Please contribute $20, $50, or $100 or whatever amount you can.
Sincerely,
Scott Brown
United States Senator
The People's Seat
Mr. Brown may want to send Ms. Warren a contribution as thanks for disseminating his appeal much farther than he ever expected it would go.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths COLWELL, PHOEBE ANN TALBOT PETERSON

 BODY:
COLWELL--Phoebe Ann Talbot Peterson, 79, departed this world October 2, 2012 in Boise, ID, with family at her side. She died peacefully and with dignity, after enduring a long struggle with Alzheimer's. Her journey begins anew, a daisy blooming in the fresh morning light. Phoebe was born on April 4, 1933 in Berlin, Germany to American banker Arthur T. Peterson and his wife, Phoebe. 
Her early childhood was spent primarily in Europe, relocating from Germany to London, and then to the US during World War II. She returned to Europe after the war ended, attended high school in Switzerland, and returned to the US as a young adult. She spent time in California before marrying and settling in Grand View-on-Hudson, New York, where she raised a family, obtained undergraduate and graduate degrees, and managed a long and productive professional career. She devoted many years of service to Nyack Hospital and the Nyack Hospital Foundation. She was very active in her community, and touched and influenced many people. Phoebe lived her final years in the presence of loving and compassionate care provided by the Staff and Volunteers at Willow Park Assisted Living Center/Kingswood Manor in Boise, ID. Phoebe lived a full life. She was funny, spontaneous, creative, witty, tenacious, at times feisty, and fiercely independent. She was a woman of many diverse roles: mother, homemaker, writer, traveler, photographer, master cook, home economist, fund-raiser, and much more. Phoebe was an avid gardener, always rescuing the least-worthy plant, and nurturing it back to life. She also loved her animals. Having grown up in many differing geographies, she valued roots, family and community. It was in Grand View where her roots were firmly planted, surrounded by her magnificent gardens, which survive today. Phoebe lives on in our hearts, minds, souls, and in the gardens of friends and family, where her plants remind us all of her. She is survived by her brother, Sterrett C. Peterson of Glenside, Pennsylvania, daughter Megan G. Colwell (Bonnie Stewart) of Oakland, California, sons Douglas T. Colwell (Carol) of Boise, Idaho, Lincoln Colwell of Sparkill, New York, Joshua Colwell (Kai) of King George, Virginia, and daughter Honor Colwell (Ken Hazucha) of Binghamton, New York. She is survived by six grandchildren, Mario and Douglas Bruzzone of California, Drew and Claire Colwell of Boise, Idaho, and Max and Heidi Colwell of King George, Virginia. A memorial service will be held at Grace Episcopal Church in Nyack, New York at 2pm on Saturday, November 3, 2012. Thoughts, testimonials, and words of sympathy can be emailed to phoebememories@gmail.com Donations in her memory can be made to The Alzheimer's Association of America or your local regional office www.alz.org

HEADLINE: Between Auto Show and Showroom, a Supercar's Mettle Is Tested

BYLINE: By RONALD AHRENS

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS
WHEN a troupe of Porsche engineers arrived here on a Monday afternoon early this month, the flamboyant graphic designs covering their cars -- prototypes of the 918 Spyder, a supercar that is more than a year from its market debut -- barely distracted tourists from their preoccupations. Instead of stopping the show, the two otherworldly supercars slipped unobtrusively into a hotel driveway.
The engineers were jubilant: a two-week shakedown run, which started in Denver and proceeded through Phoenix on a meandering, blazing-hot route to San Francisco, revealed nothing to imperil the 918 Spyder's scheduled production start-up of Sept. 18, 2013.
A plug-in hybrid that combines electric drive and a midmounted gasoline V-8, the 918 Spyder is capable of highly efficient travel (when relying exclusively on battery power) or heroic feats (when the gas and electric power plants fully combine for 795 horsepower). Only 918 examples will be made; delivery to United States customers who have made a $200,000 deposit begins in January 2014, with each car priced at $854,000, not including shipping. 
While Porsche is experienced in creating ultrafast cars and knows its way around hybrid powertrains and the production of carbon-fiber chassis, the 918's complexity presents new challenges. The Western road test was intended to verify hot-weather performance, which was reported as satisfactory. The project director, Frank Walliser, and his colleagues also worked on harmonizing the car's myriad systems. The engineers looked for hiccups in drivability that would signal a need for further development of the car's software.
''The biggest job today is the integration of the car,'' Mr. Walliser, 43, said during a ride-along session held later that 97-degree afternoon in the Beehives section of the Valley of Fire State Park, northeast of here. The park's landscape of odd sandstone formations, eroded in the 150 million years since the Jurassic period, provided a contrasting setting for the futuristic Porsche. Against a low sun, with the rocks changing hues to sometimes match Mr. Walliser's orange T-shirt, it seemed as if a John Ford western might break out.
Those who found the 918 Spyder design study so mesmerizing when it was introduced at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show would not be disappointed with the prototypes. Spattered and smudged from the journey up and down mountains and across searing basins, the cars closely resembled that sparkling concept. Key aspects that remain true include the huge wheels, 20 inches in front and 21 inches at the rear, and a signature swooping line that starts just behind each front wheel. The line continues rearward, opening up to intake scoops that supply radiators, one on each side, that cool the midmounted powertrain.
The 918 Spyder has removable roof panels, similar to those of past 911 Targa models. The roof's pronounced ''double-bubble'' contours draw straight into a similarly undulant rear cowling. The Geneva car's electric-lime exterior and interior accents survive. And by standing directly in back and staring, as an early critic observed, you can still see the face of Donald Duck.
Evolving to meet practical considerations like crashworthiness, the 918 Spyder has grown by six inches, to an overall length of roughly 183 inches. The gasoline engine has expanded, to 4.6 liters (580 horsepower) from the concept car's 3.4 liters. There are three electric motors, one at each front corner and a third integrated with the engine and transmission.
A 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission regulates all this might. To lower the car's center of gravity, the transmission has been flipped upside down, placing the weighty gear clusters closer to the road.
One notable change from the concept car is the deletion of exhaust pipes that emerged through the bodywork just ahead of each rear wheel. Hot gases now exit upward through the rear cowl, with the two pipes looking like ship's funnels.
''The temperature problem in back is very challenging,'' a powertrain engineer, Christian Hauck, said. ''We decided to get the heat as soon as possible out of the back.''
According to Mr. Walliser, the project is on target to meet its three main goals, which include delivering an evocative design, excelling at hotlaps around the Nürburgring and realizing a fuel economy equivalent of 70 m.p.g. when the car runs in electric mode. (As an E.V., it can go up to 15 miles on power from the 6.8-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery with a top speed of 90 m.p.h.)
Glancing through the windshield at the square-crowned fenders and the desert shrubs beyond, I buckled into the passenger seat as Mr. Walliser demonstrated the small knob on the steering wheel used to select the driving mode settings: electric, hybrid, sport and race. He took off forcefully with the car in its electric mode; aside from the lack of a clanging bell, it sounded and felt like an old-fashioned streetcar, grumpily urging us forward.
Hybrid mode wakes the gas engine for variable assist between the two systems. Sport mode, with added assistance from the electric drive, knocked off my hat as I shot backward against the headrest. Race-mode acceleration was something else entirely, with all the raucous sounds of a cattle drive compressed into three surf-guitar seconds -- about how long it takes to go from 0 to 60 m.p.h. Abrupt crests and random whoop-de-dos on the park road did not flummox the suspension.
But because of the dusty interior and the swarm of cables and electrical boxes, I kept thinking of the 918 Spyder prototype as a kit car instead of the state-of-the-art machine that will cost as much as four Bentley Continental GTs with enough left over to buy a Panamera S. Undoubtedly, this perception will recede as the 918 takes on its final polished form.
Putting aside these subjective responses, though, questions linger about Porsche's special sports car. Foremost is the daunting task of finishing development work in less than a year. Both prototypes balked at times, and the gray one was momentarily stilled at the side of the road during one ride-along. The second question is about the necessity of the hybrid electric drive system. Are the benefits really worth the cost and complication?
Once it's removed from the gaudy surroundings of the Las Vegas Strip, though, the 918 Spyder showed incomparable zing. Michael Hölscher, project manager for research at Porsche, said people had reacted generously throughout the team's journey.
''I've never had such positive feedback,'' Mr. Hölscher said. ''Everybody's happy we made the car. I think we did the right thing.''

HEADLINE: The Potato, as Art And Instrument

BYLINE: By AILEEN JACOBSON

 BODY:
EAST ISLIP, N.Y.
A TROUPE of 16 battery-operated, dancing Mr. Potato Heads, which can be set to skitter across a gallery floor, suggests the whimsical side of the three exhibitions on the subject of potatoes currently at the Islip Art Museum.
But they represent only part of what Jeffrey Allen Price, an artist and teacher who curated all three shows, calls the ''potato-art spectrum,'' ranging from the ridiculous to the socially relevant. 
One of the exhibitions, ''Potato Project Room: Unpacking My Potato Collection -- Artifacts, Ephemera and Recent Acquisitions,'' draws on about 5,000 potato-related items, including the Mr. Potato Heads, that Mr. Price has collected over several years.
Most of them, he said on the exhibitions' opening day in September, are in the museum's Historical Room, though many are in boxes that he said he would unpack, catalog and repack most afternoons throughout the run of the show as part of his conceptual-art installation.
The four galleries in the main part of the museum contain ''Occupying Potato: The Cult of the Potato 2012,'' a concurrent exhibition of 100 pieces of potato-themed art -- including paintings, photographs, videos and sculptures -- by 30 artists from 12 countries.
''Archie Rand: The Potato Prints,'' an exhibition mainly in the museum's gift shop, has 29 works that Mr. Rand, a Brooklyn artist, made in 1988 with Jon Cone, a printmaker. Rather than having potatoes as the subjects of his works, Mr. Rand used hand-cut chunks of color-stained potatoes to create intricate images of cartoonish people, stars, swirls and other figures.
Beth Giacummo, the museum's administrator and curator, said she wanted to work with Mr. Price, whom she has known for a few years, after seeing a very different potato exhibition he organized at the Williamsburg Art and Historical Center in Brooklyn last year.
''Our mission is to present exhibitions that expose the community to contemporary art and make it accessible,'' she said. ''What is more accessible than the potato?''
The three-pronged show is ''part parody and part sincerity,'' Mr. Price, who lives in Lake Grove, said. There is humor in many of his own pieces, like a surreal video in which his face appears on a screen that is surrounded by a mound of real spuds as he continuously repeats the word ''potato'' for one hour.
But the potato is also important economically and historically, he said.
For instance, in a hallway at the beginning of the exhibition is a work of folk art embroidery showing a harvest on mountainous terrain. It is from Peru, which he called ''the birthplace of the potato,'' where the cultivation of potatoes as food started millenniums ago.
A 1979 totemlike sculpture by the Italian-born American artist Italo Scanga, ''Irish Potato Famine No. 1,'' refers to the famine of the late 1840s, Mr. Price said. He called the five-foot-tall work, which he placed in the center of the museum's largest gallery, ''poetic.'' It arrived with spikes on which the museum had to place fresh potatoes, Mr. Price said, as specified by the artist, who died in 2001.
Another piece in that large gallery is based on the same tragic episode: a model of the Irish Hunger Memorial that the New York artist Brian Tolle designed for Battery Park City in 2002. The actual memorial covers a half-acre on the Hudson River.
Mr. Tolle refers to the scientific name for the blight that destroyed the Irish crops in ''Phytophthora Infestans,'' a 2009 sculpture that is actually about Levittown. The same disease affected potato fields on Long Island, Mr. Price said, causing many farmers to sell their land cheap, ''helping to pave the way for Levittown and suburban sprawl.''
Mr. Tolle's piece incorporates a wheelbarrow, plastic potatoes and a rubbery deflated-looking house.
At least two artists in the exhibition grew up on Long Island, though their works don't refer to it specifically. Ryan Seslow, whose ''ipotatoi'' portrays a man with a large potato as his head, was raised in Island Park and now lives in Port Washington, according to Mr. Price, who said he knows Mr. Seslow as a colleague and a friend.
Anna Alicja Feitzinger, a former student of Mr. Price's at the Art League of Long Island, grew up in Lindenhurst and now lives in Brooklyn, he said. She contributed ''Solanum Universom,'' a microscopic photograph of potato cells displayed in a light box.
Ms. Feitzinger's work is in the same gallery as a video made by Viviane Le Courtois, an artist based in Denver with a French background: it focuses on her hands briskly peeling potato after potato. In the exhibition's catalog, Ms. Le Courtois writes that her work ''deeply connects with my heritage and the basic actions of life: women in my family have obsessively peeled and cooked potatoes for generations.''
Ms. Le Courtois's video makes for a nice contrast with another one on a monitor in the entrance hallway, Mr. Price pointed out. Made by Ciprian Muresan, a Romanian artist, it shows five soldiers ''resigned to the mundane task of peeling a giant heap of potatoes,'' according to Mr. Price. The work is humorous in a deadpan way, he said.
Several other pieces have comic touches, including ''Potato Portraits,'' by Ginou Choueiri, a Lebanese artist. She transferred photographs of real people onto the wrinkly skins of odd-shaped potatoes and then photographed the results.
Andrzej Maciejewski, who was born in Poland, took close-up photographs of peculiar-looking spuds and gave each a name -- one is ''Mathilde Mol.'' He writes in the catalog that he named his potatoes ''not in order to suggest that they look like people, but simply to emphasize their individual uniqueness.''
The artists who lent their works, Mr. Price said, ''are humble, generous and have a sense of humor,'' qualities he also attributes to the lowly tuber. The artists, he said, ''evoke the potato spirit.''
Three exhibitions of contemporary potato art, curated by Jeffrey Allen Price, will be at the Islip Art Museum, 50 Irish Lane, East Islip, through Nov. 18. Information: islipartmuseum.org or (631) 224-5402.

HEADLINE: Going Far, Without Regrets

BYLINE: By JuE WONG. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
I WAS born and raised in Singapore. When I was 12, I told my mother, ''I'm going to work in the Big Apple one day.'' She said she wasn't surprised, because as a young child I had held my chopsticks far away from my food. In the Chinese culture that means you're going to live far from home.
My parents always told me I could do whatever I wanted. My mother managed an I.T. department in an oil company. At 16, I worked at her company as a receptionist during school vacations and discovered the value of social skills. If someone became impatient waiting in the reception area, I found ways to divert their attention to calm them down. My mom had lunch with me every day, which made me feel grown up. 
I wanted to attend college in another country, so I made a deal with my mother: if she let me study overseas, I'd return to Singapore after college. I chose the Australian National University in Canberra, partly because Australia had a British school system like Singapore's. I received a scholarship to spend a year at U.C.L.A. as an exchange student, and I graduated from A.N.U. in 1987 with a degree in political science.
When I returned to Singapore, I thought I'd work for the diplomatic corps and travel, but a friend in government advised me that I would have to be a graduate of a local university even to get an interview. When I couldn't get into government, I got a job at Cargill in commodity trading and worked in Singapore, Hong Kong and Geneva for the next seven years. I met my husband, Robert Fidler, while working there.
The company fast-tracked me; when I left I was managing global teams of traders and a trading portfolio of $2.5 billion. While there, I applied to the London School of Economics and was accepted, but I deferred attending for a year, then chose a different path.
In 1994, I left Cargill and worked in Thailand and China for a sugar company to help with a joint venture. Then PepsiCo International recruited me to help with foreign-exchange currency swap programs. I then ran my own business strategy consulting company for three years before the Dial Corporation recruited me.
In 2002, I entered the skin care industry, which was exploding. For the next seven years, I worked for three skin care companies, including ZO Skin Health, created by Dr. Zein Obagi, in New York.
In 2009, I moved to Atlanta after being recruited as C.E.O. of another skin care company, Astral Health and Beauty. Three weeks after I started, my husband died of a heart attack.
Going to work every day helped me cope with his death. He had supported me in the move, and I didn't want his death to be in vain. I also decided to become involved with the American Heart Association. I believed that my personal situation might be a benefit in raising awareness for the cause. Although I was new to Atlanta, I raised $350,000 with many of my contacts outside the city.
This summer, I joined the StriVectin Operating Company, which makes and sells anti-aging skin care products, as C.E.O. The challenge of this industry is to be believable, and to do that, companies have to be truthful about what products can do. Women in their 40s are smarter than to think a product can make them look like a 20-year-old, but they still want to look their best.
My husband and I coordinated our career moves according to each other's jobs. I have always worked. He helped my career immensely. Our son and daughter are in their 20s now. To me, regrets are not about failures; they're about things you wanted to try and didn't. Because I never felt guilty about my choices and my husband was behind me, I was able to do my best.

HEADLINE: A Grand Experiment To Rein In Climate Change

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
LEGGETT, Calif. -- Braced against a steep slope, Robert Hrubes cinched his measuring tape around the trunk of one tree after another, barking out diameters like an auctioneer announcing bids. ''Twelve point two!'' ''Fourteen point one!''
Mr. Hrubes's task, a far cry from forestry of the past, was to calculate how much carbon could be stored within the tanoak, madrone and redwood trees in that plot. Every year or so, other foresters will return to make sure the trees are still standing and doing their job.
Such audits will be crucial as California embarks on its grand experiment in reining in climate change. On Jan. 1, it will become the first state in the nation to charge industries across the economy for the greenhouse gases they emit. Under the system, known as ''cap and trade,'' the state will set an overall ceiling on those emissions and assign allowable emission amounts for individual polluters. A portion of these so-called allowances will be allocated to utilities, manufacturers and others; the remainder will be auctioned off.
Over time, the number of allowances issued by the state will be reduced, which should force a reduction in emissions. 
To obtain the allowances needed to account for their emissions, companies can buy them at auction or on the carbon market. They can secure offset credits, as they are known, either by buying leftover allowances from emitters that have met their targets or by purchasing them from projects that remove carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, like the woods where Mr. Hrubes was working.
Dozens of verifiers from different fields, from chemists to accountants to foresters, will be the first line of defense in making sure the benefits are real.
Mr. Hrubes said his goal in any audit was to ensure that the forest's owner was ''being conservative whenever a judgment call has to be made'' in calculating greenhouse gas reductions.
The outsize goals of California's new law, known as A.B. 32, are to lower California's emissions to what they were in 1990 by 2020 -- a reduction of roughly 30 percent -- and, more broadly, to show that the system works and can be replicated.
The risks for California are enormous. Opponents and supporters alike worry that the program could hurt the state's fragile economy by driving out refineries, cement makers, glass factories and other businesses. Some are concerned that companies will find a way to outmaneuver the system, causing the state to fall short of its emission reduction targets.
''The worst possible thing to happen is if it fails,'' said Robert N. Stavins, a Harvard economist.
Just three years ago, California's plan was viewed as a trial run for a national carbon market that one day might tie into existing markets in Europe and elsewhere. President Obama's first budget proposal included a cap-and-trade program to cut national greenhouse gas emissions 14 percent by 2020; the House later passed an energy and climate bill that incorporated such a program.
But in 2010, political forces backed by the biggest emitters, oil and coal companies, blocked the plan in the Senate. In that year's midterm elections, conservative Republicans disavowed their party's role in creating similar programs; they continue to deride it as ''cap and tax.''
California air regulators are proud of their record in leading the nation to new auto emissions standards in the 1960s and efficiency standards for appliances in the 1970s. And so the pressure is on the state's Air Resources Board to get this right.
At first, only four means of carbon reduction will be approved for offset credits: timber management, the destruction of coolant gases, cuts in methane emissions from livestock waste and tree planting projects in urban areas. Already, developers of offset projects in more than 20 states are preparing to enter the new market, which for now accepts only credits generated in the United States. Some projects send coolant gases to be destroyed at an incinerator in Arkansas; others, tied to dairies in states like Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin, will capture methane from livestock waste.
Most of these projects already sell offset credits in other markets like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program covering utilities in the Northeast.
But offsets can be prone to misuse; some have generated significant private profits while producing questionable environmental benefits. The European Union's eight-year-old carbon trading market has been tarnished by fake credits and audits that failed to meet minimum standards. California's offsets have already been challenged in court by environmentalists who argue that offset developers will earn money for actions that they would have taken even if the program did not exist.
''If there is a loss of confidence because there is a sense that people have been cheating and the offsets are not real, that will be a problem,'' said Kevin Kennedy, an economist with the World Resources Institute in Washington.
That is why there is such a need for qualified verifiers. This summer, four foresters from around the country gathered in a Los Angeles suburb for a $2,900 test-preparation course to master the new system in advance of a required state test.
All had experience in verification in other carbon trading systems -- so much so that they offered their instructors sharp critiques on the 111 pages of rules. One even challenged the algorithms central to the forest benefit calculations.
''If they don't get the equations right, there could be a real problem,'' said Terese Walters, a forester from Oregon. She is hoping that having California credentials will lead to lucrative opportunities. Ms. Walters and Caitlin Sellers, a forester from Florida in the class, both work for Environmental Services of Jacksonville, Fla., one of the country's largest environmental consulting firms. David Bubser, another student, is a Minnesota forester and a regional manager for the nonprofit Rainforest Alliance.
There are several basic requirements for a forest offset. Credits cannot be granted for preserving trees that were going to be left standing anyway. The change must be long-lasting: trees must be left intact for a century. And owners must hire accredited verifiers to audit their claims.
The offset marketplace is already beginning to hum as companies gear up for California's rollout.
Independent verifiers can make $800 to $1,200 a day, according to Mr. Bubser. Scientific Certification Systems, Mr. Hrubes's employer, which verified 4.2 million tons of carbon offsets around the world last year, added two foresters this summer, for a total of six.
Sacramento's municipal utility recently held a conference call with potential vendors of credits to offset some of the 1.2 million tons of carbon dioxide emitted annually from its gas-fired power plant -- possibly by buying 200,000 credits annually.
Utility officials made it clear during the call that the more measurable and reliable the offset, the more valuable it would be. The administrators of California's program have set a floor price for allowances at $10 per metric ton of emissions during the first auction in November. Once the program gets going, the actual value of allowances will fluctuate as they are traded.
The Redwood Forest Foundation, created to promote sustainable forestry but also to keep timber jobs in Mendocino County, is considering selling offset credits. Its biggest asset is the 50,000-acre Usal Redwood Forest, where Mr. Hrubes was working, which the foundation acquired in 2007 with a $65 million bank loan. The foundation needs to pay down its debt. It reaped $19.5 million selling a conservation easement last year, but the idea of a new revenue source is alluring.
''When you need an economic return, one way is to maximize timber harvest,'' said Tom Tuchmann, the group's acting executive director. ''The other way is to look at nontraditional value streams.''
But making strategic decisions about how many trees to harvest and how many to use to lock up carbon is an uncertain business. Other carbon markets have generally not done well by investors, and some brokerages have closed their carbon desks.
''There are so many people who are disappointed,'' said Thaddeus Huetteman, the president of Power and Energy Analytic Resources of Atlanta. ''What they are really looking for is for California to show we can create a new market of significance in the world's ninth-largest economy.''
So California Goes: Articles in this series will examine the state's new carbon trading law.

HEADLINE: Board to Buyer: Nah. Not at That Price.

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
BUYING or selling a Manhattan co-op has long presented unexpected pitfalls and moments of unique drama. But as real estate prices continue relatively flat, one obstacle has become more prevalent: Co-op boards are rejecting sales outright if they deem the price of the apartment to be too low.
Some boards are so determined to hold the line on prices that they are unswayed by buyers' offers to place years of maintenance fees in escrow, to increase the down payment and even to pay in cash.
Co-op boards aren't required to disclose the reasons they reject applications, which makes it difficult to determine just how often buyers are being turned down because the offer isn't as high as the board might like. But interviews with more than a dozen Manhattan real estate experts, including brokers, board members and real estate lawyers, suggest that boards are saying no more often as they seek to maintain the value of the apartments in their buildings amid a sea of price-conscious buyers. 
''In the last month,'' said Aaron Shmulewitz, a real estate lawyer, ''I must have had 5 to 10 questions about that from various boards that have turned down or have contemplated turning down purchases for price, as well as various purchasers who contacted us for being turned down.'' Mr. Shmulewitz oversees the co-op/condo practice at the Manhattan law firm Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman.
''I don't know if prices have gone down, or if boards are expecting the price to go up,'' he added. But the incidence of board rejections because of low sales prices has been ''markedly increasing.''
Outside of New York, such impediments to homeownership are largely unheard of, because co-ops are so rare. But they account for 75 percent of the housing stock for sale in Manhattan, according to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the Miller Samuel appraisal firm. And although some condos now also ask buyers to submit financial information when they apply, co-op boards subject potential shareholders to more rigorous scrutiny, often requiring reams of financial and personal information, right down to references for pets.
Many buyers are willing to undergo the anxiety-inducing process to get into the Manhattan market, where inventory has become particularly tight. But few are willing to overpay. At the same time, some sellers who lack equity or the economic stability to trade up to a new apartment have decided to cut their losses and list their apartments for prices lower than they had hoped.
''If you're desperate to get out because you've been waiting for two years,'' Mr. Miller said, ''you sell for what you think you can get.''
Evelyne Luest hasn't quite reached the desperation level, but her patience is running thin. Ms. Luest, a professional pianist, listed the Hudson Heights one-bedroom apartment that she uses as a practice studio for about $300,000 in 2009, just as the market was beginning to plunge.
Earlier this year, after repeatedly lowering the asking price, she was pleased to receive an all-cash offer for $225,000 -- slightly less than 6 percent below the asking price of $239,000 --from a fellow musician, Thomas Bergeron of South Hadley, Mass. They went into contract in the summer. Mr. Bergeron made plans to move. Everything seemed to be falling into place until the board rejected his application.
Ms. Luest said she had spoken with two board members and the building's sponsor, who all confirmed that price had been a deciding factor. ''It's a business problem,'' she said. ''It's not good business for them to sell apartments for a low price.''
After he was turned down, Mr. Bergeron, who recently began a two-year teaching fellowship, offered to put a year's worth of maintenance in escrow upfront and to have his mother sign as a guarantor -- even though he was paying the $225,000 in cash. But he drew the line at paying a higher price, which was suggested by Ms. Luest and her broker as well as Mr. Bergeron's broker, Kelly Cole of the Corcoran Group.
''In my opinion,'' Mr. Bergeron said, ''the price we went into contract on was the market price.''
In the end, Ms. Luest decided not to pursue the offer. Mr. Bergeron is now renting, and she has relisted her apartment at the slightly higher price of $259,000.
The board, reached via the building's management company, declined to discuss its decision.
For all anyone knows, there may have been other reasons Mr. Bergeron was turned down. His profession as a trumpet player could have raised the issue of a potential noise threat.
''I don't understand how it can be legal for them to deny people without giving any reason,'' he said. ''It really surprised me that that was O.K. to do.''
As long as it does not discriminate illegally, a co-op can turn down a sale for practically any reason. And recent court decisions have held that a board's decision to reject apartment sales because of a low price falls within its business judgment.
Compared with just three years ago, ''a board's price-based rejection of an apartment transfer is much more likely to be protected and insulated from challenge in 2012,'' said Eva Talel, a partner at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan in charge of the co-op/condominium board representation group. In January she co-wrote an article in The New York Law Journal about co-op rejections based on pricing. ''I think courts began to feel a greater comfort level in addressing the issue of the scope of the board's business judgment to deal with what is a legitimate concern for buildings,'' she said. ''If prices are not sustained at a certain level, then it would likely have a negative impact on the values of other apartments.''
If the only thing holding up a sale is the price on paper, brokers say there are ways to get around the problem. Earlier this summer June L. Gottlieb, a broker at Warburg Realty, encountered a seller who would not accept her buyer's $690,000 cash offer for a Midtown East pied-à-terre listed at $700,000 for fear the board would consider it too low and not approve the sale. The buyer refused to increase his offer because the apartment, which was part of an estate sale, needed a total renovation.
''The only way to get the deal done was to agree to split the flip tax,'' Ms. Gottlieb said. The buyer paid more for the apartment in the contract, but at the closing the seller wrote him a check for part of the flip tax, ''so the contract read at a price that would be acceptable at the board,'' she said.
Another creative solution, brokers say, is to increase the purchase price on paper and create an offsetting credit, or a ''seller's concession.'' A buyer willing to pay, say, $770,000 for an apartment listed at $800,000, would assent to the $800,000 price, then at closing receive a credit of $30,000 in the form of a check from the seller to be used for renovations or other improvements. That way, the buyer would pay no more than previously agreed, the seller would be able to sell the apartment, albeit at a cost, and the transaction would be recorded at a price that pleased the co-op board.
Such deals are completely legal, as long as the marked-up sales price is disclosed in the transaction documents and all parties understand and agree to it, said Mr. Shmulewitz of Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman.
But Barry Weidenbaum, a New York real estate lawyer, pointed out that some banks and co-ops ''may not view such an arrangement as proper.'' Some banks, for example, limit seller's concessions or credits, often capping them at 6 percent, he said.
While secrecy is typical in cases of rejection involving price, some co-op boards are taking a more direct approach. Steven R. Wagner, a real estate lawyer who is on the board of Southgate, a five-building co-op complex in the East 50s near the East River, said sales price had not been an issue there until earlier this year. ''Suddenly, there were three or four apartments that came up, all of which were significantly lower than where the apartments had been previously selling for,'' he said.
But rather than flat-out rejecting applicants who otherwise would have passed muster with the board, he said, ''we actually took a chance and raised the issue with the broker and individuals and said, 'Listen, before we say no to this application, we want you to know it's because of this, and if you wanted to submit a different contract price, very likely no would be yes.' And people did in fact come back.''
Still, even with the best intentions, boards that try to control sales prices may end up hurting themselves. ''The irony,'' Mr. Miller said, is that ''by being too aggressive in policing transfers of property in your co-op, you can actually make it worse.'' When apartment deals are repeatedly turned down because the board wants a higher price, the properties end up lingering on the market. The inference, he pointed out, ''is they are overpriced when they're not.''
The board unwilling to approve a lower price for an apartment may also be missing a signal from a seller who is experiencing financial distress and could end up defaulting on maintenance if unable to sell. And co-ops that repeatedly turn down applicants for price reasons also run the risk of gaining a reputation as a tough building -- which could ultimately backfire.
''This always says something to me about the board in the building,'' said Ms. Cole, the broker who represented Mr. Bergeron, the trumpet player, ''and it sends a really bad message. Now, when working with a buyer, I say: 'By the way, just know there was a board turndown here with a cash buyer, and they pulled the rug out from everyone. So buyer beware.' ''

HEADLINE: Iran's Hand Is Suspected In Computer Attacks

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and DAVID E. SANGER; Nicole Perlroth contributed reporting from San Francisco.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- American intelligence officials are increasingly convinced that Iran was the origin of a serious wave of network attacks that crippled computers across the Saudi oil industry and breached financial institutions in the United States, episodes that contributed to a warning last week from Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta that the United States was at risk of a ''cyber-Pearl Harbor.''
After Mr. Panetta's remarks on Thursday night, American officials described an emerging shadow war of attacks and counterattacks already under way between the United States and Iran in cyberspace.
Among American officials, suspicion has focused on the ''cybercorps'' that Iran's military created in 2011 -- partly in response to American and Israeli cyberattacks on the Iranian nuclear enrichment plant at Natanz -- though there is no hard evidence that the attacks were sanctioned by the Iranian government. 
The attacks emanating from Iran have inflicted only modest damage. Iran's cyberwarfare capabilities are considerably weaker than those in China and Russia, which intelligence officials believe are the sources of a significant number of probes, thefts of intellectual property and attacks on American companies and government agencies.
The attack under closest scrutiny hit Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil company, in August. Saudi Arabia is Iran's main rival in the region and is among the Arab states that have argued privately for the toughest actions against Iran. Aramco, the Saudi state oil company, has been bolstering supplies to customers who can no longer obtain oil from Iran because of Western sanctions.
The virus that hit Aramco is called Shamoon and spread through computers linked over a network to erase files on about 30,000 computers by overwriting them. Mr. Panetta, while not directly attributing the strike to Iran in his speech, called it ''probably the most destructive attack that the private sector has seen to date.''
Until the attack on Aramco, most of the cybersabotage coming out of Iran appeared to be what the industry calls ''denial of service'' attacks, relatively crude efforts to send a nearly endless stream of computer-generated requests aimed at overwhelming networks. But as one consultant to the United States government on the attacks put it several days ago: ''What the Iranians want to do now is make it clear they can disrupt our economy, just as we are disrupting theirs. And they are quite serious about it.''
The revelation that Iran may have been the source of the computer attacks was reported earlier by The Washington Post and The Associated Press.
The attacks on American financial institutions, which prevented some bank customers from gaining access to their accounts online but did not involve any theft of money, seemed to come from various spots around the world, and so their origins are not certain. There is some question about whether those attacks may have involved outside programming help, perhaps from Russia.
Mr. Panetta spoke only in broad terms, stating that Iran had ''undertaken a concerted effort to use cyberspace to its advantage.'' Almost immediately, experts in cybersecurity rushed to fill in the blanks.
''His speech laid the dots alongside each other without connecting them,'' James A. Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote Friday in an essay for ForeignPolicy.com. ''Iran has discovered a new way to harass much sooner than expected, and the United States is ill-prepared to deal with it.''
Iran has a motive, to retaliate for both the American-led financial sanctions that have cut its oil exports nearly in half, and for the cybercampaign by the United States and Israel against Iran's nuclear enrichment complex at Natanz.
That campaign started in the Bush administration, when the United States and Israel first began experimenting with an entirely new generation of weapon: a cyberworm that could infiltrate another state's computers and then cause havoc on computer-controlled machinery. In this case, it resulted in the destruction of roughly a fifth of the nuclear centrifuges that Iran uses to enrich uranium, though the centrifuges were eventually replaced, and Iran's production capability has recovered.
Iran became aware of the attacks in the summer of 2010, when the computer worm escaped from the Natanz plant and was replicated across the globe. The computer industry soon named the escaped weapon Stuxnet.
Iran announced last year that it had begun its own military cyberunit, and Brig. Gen. Gholamreza Jalali, the head of Iran's Passive Defense Organization, said the Iranian military was prepared ''to fight our enemies'' in ''cyberspace and Internet warfare.'' Little is known about how that group is organized, or where it has bought or developed its expertise.
The United States has never acknowledged its role in creating the Stuxnet virus, nor has it said anything about the huge covert program that created it, code-named Olympic Games, which was first revealed earlier this year by The New York Times. President Obama drastically expanded the program as a way to buy time for sanctions to affect Iran, and to stave off a military attack on the Iranian facilities by Israel, which he feared could quickly escalate into a broader war.
In advance of Mr. Panetta's speech in New York on Thursday, senior officials debated how much to talk about the United States's offensive capabilities, assessing whether such an acknowledgment could help create a deterrent for countries contemplating attacks on the country
But Mr. Panetta carefully avoided using the words ''offense'' or ''offensive'' in the context of American cyberwarfare, instead defining the Pentagon's capabilities as ''action to defend the nation.''
''We won't succeed in preventing a cyber attack through improved defenses alone,'' Mr. Panetta said. ''If we detect an imminent threat of attack that will cause significant, physical destruction in the United States or kill American citizens, we need to have the option to take action against those who would attack us to defend this nation when directed by the president. For these kinds of scenarios, the department has developed that capability to conduct effective operations to counter threats to our national interests in cyberspace.''
The comments indicated that the United States might redefine defense in cyberspace as requiring the capacity to reach forward over computer networks if an attack was detected or anticipated, and take pre-emptive action. These same offensive measures also could be used in a punishing retaliation for a first-strike cyberattack on an American target, senior officials said.
One senior intelligence official described a debate inside the Obama administration over the pros and cons of openly admitting that the United States has deployed a new cyber weapon, and could use it in response to an attack, or pre-emptively.
For now, officials have decided to hold back. ''The countries who need to know we have it already know,'' the senior intelligence official said.

HEADLINE: At the Corner of Hope and Worry

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
ELYRIA, Ohio
Another day begins with a sound softer than a finger-snap, in an Ohio place called Elyria. In the central square of this small city, the gushing water fountain applauds the early-morning chorus of sparrows. A car clears its throat. A door slams. And then: click.
The faint sound comes as 7:00 flashes on the clock of the Lorain National Bank building, looming over the square. The pull of a string -- click -- has sent life pulsing through a neon sign, announcing to all of Elyria that, once more, against the odds, Donna's Diner is open.
Its proprietor, Donna Dove, 57, ignites the grill that she seems to have just turned off, so seamlessly do her workdays blend into one endless shift. She wears her blond hair in a ponytail and frames her hazel eyes with black-rimmed glasses that tend to get smudged with grill grease. She sees the world through the blur of her work. 
A dozen years ago, Donna found a scrap of serendipity on the sidewalk: a notice that a local mom-and-pop restaurant was for sale. After cooking for her broken family as a child, after cooking for county inmates at one of her many jobs, she had come to see food as life's binding agent, and a diner as her calling. She maxed out her credit cards, cashed in her 401(k) and opened a business to call her own.
Donna's Diner. Donna's.
You know this place: It is Elyria's equivalent to that diner, that coffee shop, that McDonald's. From the vantage point of these booths and Formica countertops, the past improves with distance, the present keeps piling on, and a promising future is practically willed by the resilient patrons.
It is where the recession and other issues of the day are lived as much as discussed. Where expectations for a certain lifestyle have been lowered and hopes for salvation through education and technology have been raised. Where the presidential nominees Barack Obama and Mitt Romney each hope that his plan for a way back will resonate with the Donna Doves, who try to get by in places like Elyria -- where the American dream they talk about can sometimes seem like a tease.
But for now, at least, the door to Donna's is open. So take a seat. Have a cup of coffee. Maybe some eggs.
This morning, as usual, Pete Aldrich is helping Donna through the new-dawn isolation, turning on the coffee and being compensated by food and tips from the occasional delivery. In his early 50s, well-educated and from regional royalty, he has hit some hard times, and may or may not have slept in his car last night, cocooned by his bundled possessions.
Pete tries, though, he tries. He often leaves straight from Donna's for a job interview, hustling out with purpose, no matter that his thick-lensed eyeglasses are missing one arm. Something will turn up.
That is the communal hope. Donna, for example, is dogged by the day's anxieties. Why are her receipts going down? What lunch special can she offer to clean out the refrigerator? Should she buy less perch for her Friday fish fry? Can she slide a month on her electric bill? Since she already doesn't have health insurance, what else can she cut?
''I'm just going in circles and circles and circles,'' Donna says one day, gazing through smudged glasses. ''And not getting anyplace.''
The fresh aroma of coffee face-slaps the air. Soon the Breakfast Club regulars, that gaggle of Elyrian past and present, will be here to renew their continuing discussion of what was, is and isn't in this city of 55,000. The presidential election sometimes serves as a conversation starter, like a curio placed between the salt and pepper shakers.
The talk will continue as yolk stains harden and refills turn tepid. Their Ohio is a swing state, after all, and their Elyria sits precariously on that swing. More Democratic than Republican, it has several global companies and the memory of many more; an embattled middle class and encroaching poverty; and the faint sense that the Next Big Thing better arrive before even its beloved park fountain, visible from the diner's front window, gets shut off.
Of course, the friendly political quarrel between the regulars Speedy Amos, 86, Republican, and Jim Dall, 89, Democrat, dates back to ''I Like Ike'' and ''All The Way With Adlai.'' And John Haynes, lawyer, Democrat, and Jack Baird, councilman, Republican, will debate without ever changing minds. It will be others, the quiet, still-undecided ones, who will help to make the big decision, Obama or Romney.
The diner waits. Pete sips coffee and reads The Chronicle-Telegram through the damaged glasses he hopes to replace someday. Donna stands by the front door, near her Friday fish fry sign, peering through the plate-glass window with expectation. If it were only about location -- well, she has it.
Her diner, in an 1880s brick building at the corner of Middle Avenue and Second Street, sits along the central park, Ely Square, where the fountain's mist blesses those who linger and a statue of a Union soldier rises from slab memorials for every American conflict from the War of Independence (1775-1783) to the War on Terrorism (2001- ).
The diner is near the majestic old courthouse, circa 1881, now mostly empty, in some disrepair and too costly to renovate. It is a short walk from the sleek new courthouse, where the Judge, a regular customer (grilled chicken, cottage cheese, fruit), ruminates in his chambers with an unlit cigar in his mouth and a portrait of Che Guevara on his wall.
It is a few storefronts away from a temp agency, where a large man in an Ohio State cap (cheeseburger, fries) dispatches the work-hungry to fleeting jobs, and a short walk from Loomis Camera, 62 years on the square, where the nonagenarian owner displays a decades-old portrait of his wife, before her arthritis, back when she was a beautiful trapeze artist, an airborne ballerina.
Finally, the diner faces City Hall, where the new mayor (bacon-lettuce-tomato-and-fried-egg sandwich and a side salad) confronts the challenges of a postindustrial, recession-haunted American city. A fourth-generation Elyrian, Mayor Holly Brinda takes hope in the city's entrepreneurial hothouse of a community college and in northeastern Ohio's can-do DNA. But some nights she cannot sleep.
Donna also knows what it means to lose sleep in Elyria, as she stands beside her closed cash register, a diner's miscellany spread out before her: a jar of 25-cent mints that certain people think are free; a spill of business cards for Vinnie's Collision Center and LePue Drain Cleaning; a box of minted toothpicks favored by the Judge; a small Southern Comfort bottle half-filled with the maple syrup that sweetens Mr. Dall's pancakes.
When the diner's door is open, Donna can hear the aching thrum of another one of the Norfolk Southern freight trains that clatter day and night through the city. Bound for Cleveland or Chicago with endless containers of goods made across the country and overseas, they slice through Elyria, once more prominent as a maker of things.
The familiar freight-train siren can conjure memories of the writer Sherwood Anderson, who once ran a mail-order and paint business down by the railroad line. One Thanksgiving Day, he said goodbye to his secretary, walked out the door and followed the tracks east, out of Elyria. A breakdown, apparently, one that led to his fictional classic ''Winesburg, Ohio,'' whose inhabitants, including some with distinctly Elyrian traits, ache for fulfillment.
Yes, Donna hears it. She also hears the Judge -- James M. Burge, the meticulously dressed administrative judge of the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas -- as he sits at the table reserved for him in the back and dines on that same health-conscious grilled-chicken lunch, day after day.
Donna, you're working yourself to death. Donna, you're not making any money. Donna, you have a heart -- feeding people who don't have money, raising money for good causes -- but there's no room for heart in capitalism.
Donna, how about this? Close up the diner, come across the street to the new courthouse and run the cafeteria: five days a week, a steady stream of customers and no worries about utilities. If you're interested, I can try to make this happen.
The Judge's words linger.
Imagine: no electric bill, no heating bill, no worries about security, air-conditioning. ...
Imagine, too: no Donna's Diner, open to all of Elyria. ...
Donna has told the Judge that she'll think about it. Maybe one of these days she'll drive to Lake Erie. Sit on one of the benches. Gaze into the undulating blue. Clear her head. These are big decisions.
Kitchen Salvation
Cooking is vital to Donna. You can lose yourself in the stirring of sauce. You can nourish others and make things seem better, if only for a little while. This she discovered early on, as the turbulent marriage of her parents was upending her childhood.
Born on Flag Day 1955, Donna was the first child of a Navy man, Jerry Jacobson, and his Bay Village bride, Jean. But he refused to give up his beer and Black Velvet or his saloon romance with a woman named Sophie. Leaving a bar in Elyria one night, he drove into a telephone pole. When he awoke weeks later, he called out -- for Sophie.
With her household's cash being slapped on bar counters instead of the kitchen counter, Jean raised extra money -- between shifts at some factory or office -- by making ''sweetheart soap'' arrangements for her children to sell door-to-door. Meanwhile, as the oldest, Donna tried to fill the parental void.
One day, holding her baby brother in her arms, Donna followed her mother into a Cleveland saloon to confront her father as he sat beside a new girlfriend, this one with a beehive hairdo. The mother said the family needed money for food. The oldest child seconded the plea. The father said get lost.
After the inevitable divorce, Jean moved her four children to a government-subsidized house in Elyria, where Donna found solace, or control, in the kitchen. She began having dinner ready by the time her mother came home from work.
''She'd always put a tablecloth out, and in the summer there'd always be fresh flowers on the table,'' recalls Jean, 78. ''Dessert would be pudding, or fruit cocktail.''
Donna clearly preferred the kitchen to Elyria High School, which she found to be too big -- another way of saying integrated. She had spent most of her young life in the all-white bubble of Bay Village, 15 miles to the northeast, and now she was in a city high school with a healthy enrollment of black students.
She was intimidated by the unfamiliar, so she cut school. She became pregnant, so she got married, at 16. In the wedding photos, she and her husband look like children playing dress-up.
To say the pregnancy ended Donna's childhood is not quite accurate. In some ways, it had ended years before; in other ways, it continued. She tried to be a loving mother of two baby daughters, a doting housewife to a possessive husband, and a fun-loving young woman fond of the bar life -- all at once. Not possible.
Divorce. Temporary loss of custody. A second marriage. Two more children. A third marriage.
But Donna caught her breath, summoning the resolve that had once empowered her to confront her negligent father. She earned her general equivalency diploma. She tended bar and cooked at Stan's Villa in Elyria, across the street from the General Motors plant. She fed inmates at the Lorain County jail. She worked in marketing for the county blood bank.
One day in 2000, when she was ready for a change, Donna picked up a newspaper notice on the sidewalk that said the Lunch Break Cafe on Broad Street was for sale. Destiny. She somehow scratched up the $35,000, and spent that Mother's Day stripping the restaurant clean, even throwing out its toaster.
Driving through Elyria to her own grand opening, she thought, ''I'm going to make them remember me.''
The diner did well at first, with its 1950s décor and sandwiches named after iconic cars. It became the headquarters for Donna's annual classic-car charity event, her community project to bake cookies for soldiers overseas, her Christmas toy drive for poor children.
''She walks the walk,'' the Judge says.
This does not include all the food that Donna gave away -- to this event, to that person in need, to her father. Yes, Jerry Jacobson was back on the scene, a disabled alcoholic living above a bar in Elyria. But Donna took care of him; he was still her dad.
One day, he would be the charming Jerry, cadging beer money -- Two bucks, darlin', c'mon, two bucks -- or ordering hamburgers that he would sell for a shot and a beer down at Pudge's Place or Boomer's. The next day, he would be awful Jerry, telling Donna's customers that they would be better off at McDonald's.
Father and daughter had a contentious relationship right to the end. When he died of a heart attack in 2004, what could Donna do but place $2 in his coffin, along with a cigarette and a beer?
As downtown Elyria declined, like so many other American downtowns, so did Donna's business. By late 2009, she was preparing to turn the diner's neon off for good, but then she sensed a second chance: an ancient storefront on Middle Avenue had opened up that was larger, closer to the courts and offered a view not of Bugsy's strip joint but of verdant Ely Square.
Over several generations, many had used the three-story brick building at 148 Middle Avenue, in a stretch once called Cheapside, as their claim stake -- not to prosperity, but to the chance of it. The Candyland store, with sweets to cut the Depression's bitter taste. The H. W. Guthrie store, selling a dozen honey-dipped doughnuts for a quarter. The Roy E. Hultz store, for the supplies necessary to protect your barn.
The Jack and Jill children's store. Crandall's drugstore. Hess Pharmacy, for ''sick room supplies, surgical belts and trusses.'' A real estate company, a title company, a law firm. The headquarters for local Democrats one year and for Republicans another year. Selenti's Pizza. Naples Pizza. Village Sub and Pizza.
In 1996, a proposal to demolish the building for a parking lot went nowhere. Two years later came Stackers Deli and Pizza. Then the Court Street Cafe. Then the Pulse Cafe. Now here was another aspirant, staking her claim in the Elyrian concrete.
Diner Regulars
The unseen sparrows of Ely Square continue to dominate the morning conversation, save for the occasional beckoning of another passing train. A parks employee lost in his headset hunts for overnight litter. Coins tossed for luck tremble at the bottom of the fountain's animated waters.
Inside the diner, the sole customer eats scrambled eggs, while Donna and Pete have the kind of meandering conversation that effortlessly links a new casino in Cleveland to the diner's broken dishwasher.
''Some guy at the Polish Club supposedly hit for 130 grand,'' Pete says of the casino.
''It's never-ending,'' Donna says of her own gamble.
The dining room is as narrow as a railroad car, with the Breakfast Club's front table and the Judge's back table bracketing six booths and three small tables in the middle, all adorned with sprays of artificial flowers. Along the wall protrudes a coffee counter stocked with customer-donated mugs: ''John Deere'' beside ''Cabo San Lucas'' beside ''Jesus Saves.''
In the cramped other half of the bifurcated space, the kitchen competes for room with a freezer and two large refrigerators and cases of food and foam to-go containers and ripe bananas and a tub of Country Crock spread and the latest soda delivery and stacks of mismatched plates and a bucket filled with stale bread saved for a customer who feeds the crumbs to ducks.
At the center of it all sits the squat grill, the sizzling altar guarded by Donna with raised spatula. Orders scribbled out by her harried waitresses -- her daughter Kristy, 38, and her granddaughter, Bridgette, just short of 21 -- are tucked into the grill's hood. But Donna knows her customers so well that sometimes a mere handwritten name will do. ''Ken'' means pork chops.
Donna knows their preferences, food allergies, moods, joys, sorrows. She knows to save some perch on Fridays for the Bullocks couple, Gloria and Forrest, who was born into a sharecropping family and is now a prominent civic leader. She knows to give turkey bacon to the retired judge who loves bacon but has heart problems, and to cut a distracting slice of lemon meringue pie for the cranky woman who bangs on the door with her walker and wants to know what's so good about the morning.
Even the people Donna doesn't know, she knows. Like that elfin man who comes in every Wednesday before going to the county sheriff's auction to bid for some law firm on the foreclosed properties that riddle Lorain County. He always orders coffee and plain wheat toast, always. Hence, his diner name: ''Wheat Toast.''
Donna knows how to handle the people who come in asking for a job. First thing, she escorts them to the grill to see if they can flip a frying egg. If not, the job interview ends.
She also knows how to handle Ike Maxwell when he wanders in, looking for money or food. Still built like a piston-powerful running back, he has not been the same since he was beaten on the head with a baseball bat 30 years ago. Once a high school football superstar who carried Elyria's Friday night hopes, he now loops its streets shouting ''Golden Helmet,'' ''They killed my brother'' and other phrases that only a few Elyrians can decode.
But sometimes Ike's shouting becomes disruptive, even unnerving, and Donna has to order him to leave. He may protest by shouting a few names -- President Obama! Mitt Romney! Les Miles! -- but as he heads for the door, Ike often says something else, softly:
''O.K., Donna, O.K., Donna, O.K., Donna.''
In this way, Donna's Diner has become a living thing, humming with the flow of the human condition, alternating between harried motion and fleeting rest. When lunchtime comes, an orderly chaos takes hold in the back, as the diner's telephone beckons with a ''There's no place like home'' ringtone and denizens communicate in a shorthand language rooted in the immediate.
''That's to go! That's to go! Put it in a box!''
''O.K., her Reuben went out. Are the tenders done? This is a crap microwave. This one's lettuce and mayo.''
''I just spilled ranch all over the counter.''
''I told Ryan I'd be there about 1:30.''
''This have cheese-lettuce-tomato?''
''How much is French toast with scrambled eggs?''
''Four-seventy-nine. How come I only have two sausage links?''
''Hello, Donna's Diner?''
It can get to be too much, like the smell of toast burning. An unanticipated trigger -- a forgotten order, a returned meal, a splatter of ranch dressing -- can set Donna off, and her tirades will spill into the dining room like scalding coffee.
''Is she O.K.?'' a customer asks one difficult day.
''My mom?'' asks Kristy, the waitress.
''Yes,'' the customer replies.
''No.''
Sometimes you can see why, as Donna hunches into the desk space she has carved from the back-room clutter and works through the mound of mail. ''I'm looking for shut-off notices,'' she says, half-joking.
She also examines the income and expense figures she keeps in a brown spiral notebook. Last year, the daily receipts, in terms of hundreds of dollars, were in the threes, fours and fives; this year, they are in the twos, threes and occasional fours. Meanwhile, the expenses keep coming. Rent, $650 a month. Electric, $1,416 a month.
''My bug guy, my pop guy, my towel guy, my window washer,'' she says. Cable. Orlando Bread. Port Clinton Fish.
She tries to lower expenses. When her vexing electric bill shot up a while back, she sold off several appliances and bought a cheaper, more energy-efficient freezer. She spent Mother's Day shopping for wholesale bargains on eggs and dish soap. She bounces from Rural King to Sam's Club to Giant Eagle, looking for the cheapest coffee.
She cannot afford health insurance, she says; it would be $1,500 a month for her and her out-of-work husband, Tim, who has congestive heart failure at 57. A while back, she tore something in her left shoulder while pulling a heavy box of bleach down from a shelf at Sam's Club. Never had it fixed.
Life has become cyclical. Every night, Donna returns to her modest two-story house in Elyria, with its untidy backyard that she never has the time or the energy to reclaim, and stares at the television until sleep comes. Every morning, she awakens to worries, beginning with what to offer for lunch.
Every day, after expenses, there is not much left -- though, now and then, she peels off $20 to gamble at a video-lottery place she calls ''the joint.'' And every week, after lunch, here comes Mark Ondrejech, the affable salesman for US Foods, a wholesale supplier, to provide counsel. He sits with her at a back table, opens his laptop and goes down his list.
''All your dressings are good this week? Meat broth, chicken broth, French fries? Onion rings, sauerkraut? Ketchup packets, crackers, chip bags? Foam containers are good? Dinner napkins, straws -- grape tomatoes. Steak fries, cinnamon rolls. ''
But Donna is ordering less and less from US Foods. She has raised her prices ever so slightly -- two eggs and toast went from $1.99 to $2.39 -- in trying to strike the proper balance between fair profit and customer contentment. She is making her daughter and granddaughter occasionally pay for what they eat. She is holding on for better days, amid news that a new Taco Bell is replacing a downtown apartment building once occupied by Sherwood Anderson.
A Taco Bell.
All the while, the Judge's suggestion -- that she consider moving to the courthouse cafeteria -- preys on Donna's mind. ''All you're doing is, you're working hard and you're entertaining your customers,'' she says he tells her.
But the diner's people matter to her: Pete, Speedy, the Judge, Gloria and Forrest, Ike, even that unpleasant woman who bangs her walker against the door. The diner matters. It all matters.
''I've got to figure out what I'm doing,'' she says. ''When I get myself to this point, I can't see a way out.''
Haunted by Fears
The Elyrian morning is now full-throated. Birds chirping, waters rushing, trains calling, music pounding from the cars stopped for the light just outside the diner. Sunlight paints the treetops of Ely Square.
Gazing at the park through her plate-glass window, Donna is reminded of a recurring image that she just can't shake: that of a short woman with unruly gray hair, hunting through the park's garbage for redeemable cans. Twenty years ago, Donna worked with this woman at a nursing home on East Avenue. She knew her to say hello.
The woman, Anna Hallman, redeems aluminum cans to pay a mortgage and make ends meet, getting about 50 cents for every 26 cans that she methodically crushes with her heel. She is 69, and other scavengers have kindly ceded to her the treasures to be found in the garbage bins downtown. And when she has had a good day, she sometimes treats herself to a meal at Donna's -- something that sticks to the ribs, like meatloaf.
Anna's situation haunts Donna. Too close. Too possible.
How she needs to step away from the grill and take that drive to Lake Erie. No breakfast orders being shouted at her. No bills demanding her attention. Just Donna alone, sitting on a bench and staring into the infinite waters that calm her, help her think. Big decisions.
But now she has customers. The first two members of the Breakfast Club take their seats at the front table. Coffee for both. No breakfast for one, eggs over medium, wheat toast for the other. Orders taken, the owner of Donna's Diner disappears into the kitchen.
DONNA'S DINER: Articles in this series will examine the expectations, disappointments and challenges that shape the lives of Donna Dove, her customers and the city they know intimately, Elyria, Ohio.

HEADLINE: Lawmen Against the Law

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

 BODY:
Seattle
LAST November, the former chief federal prosecutor from Washington State took the stage before a hall full of cops and tried to persuade the people who enforce the drug laws to change them -- specifically, to get aboard what will most likely turn out to be the nation's first successful campaign to legalize marijuana.
The sheriffs and police chiefs listened politely to John McKay, a silver-haired, Jesuit-educated lawyer who had been appointed prosecutor by President George W. Bush. The marijuana laws -- ''giving us the right to come to your home and take away your personal liberty for something that much of the community thinks is not a crime'' -- are a travesty, a farce and a crime generator, he said. 
Afterward, the cops voted not to support the ideas that became Washington's Initiative 502, which would legalize recreational use of marijuana for adults. But many officers pulled McKay aside and quietly cheered him on.
''They came up to me and said, 'We know you're right -- we just can't say so,' '' McKay recalled in an interview last week in Seattle.
Voters in three states -- Washington, Oregon and Colorado -- will decide on Election Day whether to take marijuana out of the black market shadows and put it under the daylight of state licensing and supervision. Each proposal has problems and pluses. But Washington's is the one most likely to pass, judging from the polls.
In a twist of time that any aging baby boomer can appreciate, this measure has the full backing of what used to be called the Establishment.
And if, on Nov. 6, a state finally says no to one of the most counterproductive prohibitions in the nation's history, it will be because the two sides in this continuing sham of Wile E. Coyote versus Road Runner have essentially switched.
That's right: those on the front lines of the endless drug war, the police and prosecutors, are now citing futility and common sense on behalf of legalization -- at least in this state. And many of those who now profit from the unregulated medical marijuana industry, and the larger, organized crime gangs that control the illegal wholesale scene, are against legalization. The opposition to accessible pot in this state is led by a medical marijuana clinic. Go figure.
Not all cops back legalization, of course. But here in Washington, the former top F.B.I. agent for the region, Charles Mandingo, a 27-year veteran of the drug wars, has come out in favor of legal pot. He cited the racial disparity -- that far more blacks are locked up for dope than whites -- among many reasons for the evolution of his view.
And the two candidates for sheriff in King County, the state's most populous, are practically tripping over themselves in their advocacy for doing away with marijuana possession crime.
By contrast, presenting a fine historic irony, the only organized opposition to legalization in this state is coming from longtime marijuana advocates -- the ''dispensary-quackery complex, which has turned medical marijuana into a money-grubbing sham,'' as The News Tribune newspaper of South Puget Sound memorably put it.
These pot retailers, peddling weed under a tolerance policy to anyone with an easy-to-get prescription, are backing the status quo because they make so much money off it. For the same reason, violent gangsters from Mexico to Canada are afraid of what Washington is on the verge of doing.
The dispensaries would have to give up a freewheeling business for a controlled retail environment -- licensed, regulated and taxed (at 25 percent) by the state. When California voters faced the same issue two years ago, it was also the drug cartels and the medical pot shops that fought it, and prevailed.
This time, the pillars of the community have the upper hand. McKay, now a law professor at Seattle University, has no love for pot. He knows, and has seen firsthand, how chronic use can have consequences.
''I don't think smoking marijuana is a good thing,'' he said. ''And I don't think it's a healthy thing. But as the chief federal law enforcement officer in this region I became convinced that our policy on marijuana is just plain wrong.'' It's a waste of young lives, and certainly police resources, to arrest 10,000 people a year in Washington for marijuana, he says. His sentiments are backed by leading newspapers and a number of other prosecutors, ministers and cops.
Under the Washington initiative, anyone over 21 could buy up to an ounce at a time. The proposal would also have a driving-while-stoned provision, with a maximum legal limit for THC in the blood. And, for locavores, it would require that all pot would have to be grown and processed in the state of Washington.
Will it work? The hurdles include the federal government, which still classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 illegal drug like heroin and cocaine. It could move against the states.
But that sort of conflict, says McKay, needs to play out for American society to finally move on. In the United States almost 30 million people have used marijuana in the last year. Most of them are not criminals by any stretch, he says. ''History has taught us that social change begins with rebellion among the states,'' he said. And in this case, when drug warriors switch sides.

HEADLINE: The Self-Destruction of the 1 Percent

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND. 
The editor of Thomson Reuters Digital and the author of ''Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else,'' from which this essay is adapted.

 BODY:
IN the early 14th century, Venice was one of the richest cities in Europe. At the heart of its economy was the colleganza, a basic form of joint-stock company created to finance a single trade expedition. The brilliance of the colleganza was that it opened the economy to new entrants, allowing risk-taking entrepreneurs to share in the financial upside with the established businessmen who financed their merchant voyages.
Venice's elites were the chief beneficiaries. Like all open economies, theirs was turbulent. Today, we think of social mobility as a good thing. But if you are on top, mobility also means competition. In 1315, when the Venetian city-state was at the height of its economic powers, the upper class acted to lock in its privileges, putting a formal stop to social mobility with the publication of the Libro d'Oro, or Book of Gold, an official register of the nobility. If you weren't on it, you couldn't join the ruling oligarchy. 
The political shift, which had begun nearly two decades earlier, was so striking a change that the Venetians gave it a name: La Serrata, or the closure. It wasn't long before the political Serrata became an economic one, too. Under the control of the oligarchs, Venice gradually cut off commercial opportunities for new entrants. Eventually, the colleganza was banned. The reigning elites were acting in their immediate self-interest, but in the longer term, La Serrata was the beginning of the end for them, and for Venetian prosperity more generally. By 1500, Venice's population was smaller than it had been in 1330. In the 17th and 18th centuries, as the rest of Europe grew, the city continued to shrink.
The story of Venice's rise and fall is told by the scholars Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson, in their book ''Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty,'' as an illustration of their thesis that what separates successful states from failed ones is whether their governing institutions are inclusive or extractive. Extractive states are controlled by ruling elites whose objective is to extract as much wealth as they can from the rest of society. Inclusive states give everyone access to economic opportunity; often, greater inclusiveness creates more prosperity, which creates an incentive for ever greater inclusiveness.
The history of the United States can be read as one such virtuous circle. But as the story of Venice shows, virtuous circles can be broken. Elites that have prospered from inclusive systems can be tempted to pull up the ladder they climbed to the top. Eventually, their societies become extractive and their economies languish.
That was the future predicted by Karl Marx, who wrote that capitalism contained the seeds of its own destruction. And it is the danger America faces today, as the 1 percent pulls away from everyone else and pursues an economic, political and social agenda that will increase that gap even further -- ultimately destroying the open system that made America rich and allowed its 1 percent to thrive in the first place.
You can see America's creeping Serrata in the growing social and, especially, educational chasm between those at the top and everyone else. At the bottom and in the middle, American society is fraying, and the children of these struggling families are lagging the rest of the world at school.
Economists point out that the woes of the middle class are in large part a consequence of globalization and technological change. Culture may also play a role. In his recent book on the white working class, the libertarian writer Charles Murray blames the hollowed-out middle for straying from the traditional family values and old-fashioned work ethic that he says prevail among the rich (whom he castigates, but only for allowing cultural relativism to prevail).
There is some truth in both arguments. But the 1 percent cannot evade its share of responsibility for the growing gulf in American society. Economic forces may be behind the rising inequality, but as Peter R. Orszag, President Obama's former budget chief, told me, public policy has exacerbated rather than mitigated these trends.
Even as the winner-take-all economy has enriched those at the very top, their tax burden has lightened. Tolerance for high executive compensation has increased, even as the legal powers of unions have been weakened and an intellectual case against them has been relentlessly advanced by plutocrat-financed think tanks. In the 1950s, the marginal income tax rate for those at the top of the distribution soared above 90 percent, a figure that today makes even Democrats flinch. Meanwhile, of the 400 richest taxpayers in 2009, 6 paid no federal income tax at all, and 27 paid 10 percent or less. None paid more than 35 percent.
Historically, the United States has enjoyed higher social mobility than Europe, and both left and right have identified this economic openness as an essential source of the nation's economic vigor. But several recent studies have shown that in America today it is harder to escape the social class of your birth than it is in Europe. The Canadian economist Miles Corak has found that as income inequality increases, social mobility falls -- a phenomenon Alan B. Krueger, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, has called the Great Gatsby Curve.
Educational attainment, which created the American middle class, is no longer rising. The super-elite lavishes unlimited resources on its children, while public schools are starved of funding. This is the new Serrata. An elite education is increasingly available only to those already at the top. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama enrolled their daughters in an exclusive private school; I've done the same with mine.
At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, earlier this year, I interviewed Ruth Simmons, then the president of Brown. She was the first African-American to lead an Ivy League university and has served on the board of Goldman Sachs. Dr. Simmons, a Harvard-trained literature scholar, worked hard to make Brown more accessible to poor students, but when I asked whether it was time to abolish legacy admissions, the Ivy League's own Book of Gold, she shrugged me off with a laugh: ''No, I have a granddaughter. It's not time yet.''
America's Serrata also takes a more explicit form: the tilting of the economic rules in favor of those at the top. The crony capitalism of today's oligarchs is far subtler than Venice's. It works in two main ways.
The first is to channel the state's scarce resources in their own direction. This is the absurdity of Mitt Romney's comment about the ''47 percent'' who are ''dependent upon government.'' The reality is that it is those at the top, particularly the tippy-top, of the economic pyramid who have been most effective at capturing government support -- and at getting others to pay for it.
Exhibit A is the bipartisan, $700 billion rescue of Wall Street in 2008. Exhibit B is the crony recovery. The economists Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty found that 93 percent of the income gains from the 2009-10 recovery went to the top 1 percent of taxpayers. The top 0.01 percent captured 37 percent of these additional earnings, gaining an average of $4.2 million per household.
The second manifestation of crony capitalism is more direct: the tax perks, trade protections and government subsidies that companies and sectors secure for themselves. Corporate pork is a truly bipartisan dish: green energy companies and the health insurers have been winners in this administration, as oil and steel companies were under George W. Bush's.
The impulse of the powerful to make themselves even more so should come as no surprise. Competition and a level playing field are good for us collectively, but they are a hardship for individual businesses. Warren E. Buffett knows this. ''A truly great business must have an enduring 'moat' that protects excellent returns on invested capital,'' he explained in his 2007 annual letter to investors. ''Though capitalism's 'creative destruction' is highly beneficial for society, it precludes investment certainty.'' Microsoft attempted to dig its own moat by simply shutting out its competitors, until it was stopped by the courts. Even Apple, a huge beneficiary of the open-platform economy, couldn't resist trying to impose its own inferior map app on buyers of the iPhone 5.
Businessmen like to style themselves as the defenders of the free market economy, but as Luigi Zingales, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, argued, ''Most lobbying is pro-business, in the sense that it promotes the interests of existing businesses, not pro-market in the sense of fostering truly free and open competition.''
IN the early 19th century, the United States was one of the most egalitarian societies on the planet. ''We have no paupers,'' Thomas Jefferson boasted in an 1814 letter. ''The great mass of our population is of laborers; our rich, who can live without labor, either manual or professional, being few, and of moderate wealth. Most of the laboring class possess property, cultivate their own lands, have families, and from the demand for their labor are enabled to exact from the rich and the competent such prices as enable them to be fed abundantly, clothed above mere decency, to labor moderately and raise their families.''
For Jefferson, this equality was at the heart of American exceptionalism: ''Can any condition of society be more desirable than this?''
That all changed with industrialization. As Franklin D. Roosevelt argued in a 1932 address to the Commonwealth Club, the industrial revolution was accomplished thanks to ''a group of financial titans, whose methods were not scrutinized with too much care, and who were honored in proportion as they produced the results, irrespective of the means they used.'' America may have needed its robber barons; Roosevelt said the United States was right to accept ''the bitter with the sweet.''
But as these titans amassed wealth and power, and as America ran out of free land on its frontier, the country faced the threat of a Serrata. As Roosevelt put it, ''equality of opportunity as we have known it no longer exists.'' Instead, ''we are steering a steady course toward economic oligarchy, if we are not there already.''
It is no accident that in America today the gap between the very rich and everyone else is wider than at any time since the Gilded Age. Now, as then, the titans are seeking an even greater political voice to match their economic power. Now, as then, the inevitable danger is that they will confuse their own self-interest with the common good. The irony of the political rise of the plutocrats is that, like Venice's oligarchs, they threaten the system that created them.

HEADLINE: Want Your Union to Last? Marry in New Jersey

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
ALL that nasty gossip notwithstanding, Teresa Giudice, resolute as ever on the recent ''Real Housewives of New Jersey'' reunion, apparently has not dissolved her stormy marriage. Which squares with the latest Census Bureau figures on divorce in the Garden State.
According to the 2011 American Community Survey released last month by the Census Bureau, New Jersey ranks last among the states in the percentage of residents 18 and older who are divorced. Just 9 percent of New Jersey adults are divorced, compared with nearly 52 percent of whom are now married.
''The composition of New Jersey married individuals is quite favorable across several indicators, providing some evidence for the low divorce rate,'' said Susan L. Brown, a sociology professor and co-director of the National Center for Family and Marriage Research at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. ''These factors include education, race-ethnicity, age, and age at first marriage.''
On paper, at least, Ms. Giudice personifies those demographic factors that, compared with the rest of the country, make the state such a paradigm of marital durability if not necessarily bliss. She has a college degree. She was past 25 when she married. She is white. And she and her husband were apparently wealthy enough to have piled up millions of dollars in debts. 
''Marriages are more likely to last for longer periods of time when people marry at an older age, have a higher education and earn more, and New Jersey scores high on these three criteria,'' said Naomi Cahn, a professor at George Washington University Law School and an author of ''Red Families v. Blue Families.''
''New Jerseyans are more likely than residents of most states to delay marriage until after they complete college and graduate school,'' she said. ''There are fewer divorces in New Jersey because there are fewer risk factors.''
Her co-author, June Carbone, a law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, said the ''protective factor'' is now reflected among couples marrying later and later. ''What is taking place is not necessarily age per se in sense of maturity,'' she said, ''but that people who tend to marry later tend to be wealthier and better educated and are more likely to marry someone wealthier and better educated.''
Nationally, 23 percent of the people who married within the previous year, according to the 2008-10 American Community Survey, were 18- to 24-year-olds. In New Jersey, only 13 percent were. Among all Americans who married in the preceding year, 31 percent had a bachelor's degree or higher. In New Jersey, 42 percent did. The median age at first marriage in the nation in 2011 was 28.9 for men and 26.9 for women. In New Jersey, the comparable figures were 30.2 and 28.5.
''They tend to delay marriage until an age when they're emotionally and financially ready,'' said Deborah Carr, a sociology professor at Rutgers. ''Higher education and high age at marriage are two of the most important factors that protect against divorce risk. And the current recession not withstanding, New Jersey is among the wealthier states in the nation, and economic stability also contributes to marital stability.''
Those factors also place New York and Massachusetts among the states with the lowest share of divorced people. ''This is the classic blue-state divorce pattern,'' said W. Bradford Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia. (Hawaii and North Dakota ranked low, too, but that's attributed to relatively low unemployment in those states.)
''In general, the northeastern states have lower divorce rates because their citizens are more highly educated and marry at older ages than do people in other regions,'' said Andrew J. Cherlin, a professor of public policy at Johns Hopkins.
''There is an odd and interesting relationship between states where people hold conservative values at higher levels, like the South, and higher divorce rates in those regions,'' said Rose McDermott, a political scientist at Brown. (New Jersey also had a much lower marriage rate than southern states, perhaps bolstering a credo of Raoul Lionel Felder, a prominent divorce lawyer in New York, that marriage is the first step on the road to divorce.)
The impact of the recession appears to have been mixed so far. D'Vera Cohn, a senior writer at the Pew Research Center, said: ''Perhaps couples cannot afford to get divorced during hard times. It may be too costly to live separately, one spouse may lose health benefits, divorce itself can be expensive, and so forth. But it's also possible that stress caused by job loss, foreclosure or other economic injury may raise the risk of divorce.''
Other experts speculated that New Jersey's low share of divorced people results from a range of factors, from the relatively large foreign-born population (immigrants have lower odds of divorce than the native-born population) to costly alimony provisions.
''Perhaps the New Jersey divorce rate is related to the unemployment rate or the low quotient of happiness people who live in New Jersey require,'' said Mr. Felder.
A study of other data by Philip N. Cohen, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland, found that Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and North Dakota had the lowest rate of divorces the previous year compared with their populations -- only 6 or 7 per 1,000, compared with 31 states that recorded more than 10 divorces per 1,000 residents, and Oklahoma, where nearly 14 per 1,000 said they were divorced.
The rate for men was 6.3 in New Jersey and 9.4 nationally, and for women, 7.1 and 9.7.
Over all, divorce rates peaked in the 1980s, but appear to be experiencing an uptick in the last few years.
Janet Montgomery, the English actress who stars as Martina Garretti in the new CBS series ''Made in Jersey,'' drew a contrast between her character, a lawyer from a working-class background, and another young television lawyer, Ally McBeal, who in the 1990s was worried about turning 30 while she was still single. In New Jersey now, that's almost the new normal.
''Women don't stress about that any more,'' Ms. Montgomery told TV Guide. ''I mean, I'm 26, and I think that what I love about this character is she's not trying to find a boyfriend. That is not that important to her. What is important to her is the people she loves in her life. Which I think we can all relate to, whether it be family, friends or your dog.''

HEADLINE: Ulrich Franzen, 91, Designer of Brutalist Buildings, Dies

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
Ulrich Franzen, a German-born architect whose fortresslike buildings seemed to buttress the interior landscape of New York City during the shaky 1970s, and who gave it some buoyance, too, with skywalks, died on Oct. 6 in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 91. His death was confirmed by his wife, Josephine.
Not everyone liked the skywalks, which connect buildings Mr. Franzen designed at Hunter College on Lexington Avenue. Neighbors lamented the loss of sunlight. But Mr. Franzen, a Modernist subscriber to the form-follows-function credo, considered them the functional equivalent of ivy-covered walkways for urban students. It would ''become the college community's main street,'' he wrote of the skywalk plan in 1972 in the college's student newspaper, ''well above rush-hour traffic at street level.'' 
Mr. Franzen was part of a generation of prominent American architects, including Philip Johnson, Paul Rudolph and I. M. Pei, to emerge from the Harvard School of Design after World War II. The group was deeply influenced by the Bauhaus architecture masters Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer, who taught at Harvard after fleeing the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s.
Mr. Franzen's early works are exemplars of the Modernist style, among them his first designs for private residences, most of them clean-lined, single-level structures perched on waterfronts and rock ledges, wrapped in sliding glass and flooded with light.
He also helped design the first-generation shopping mall Roosevelt Field, on Long Island, working with Mr. Pei and Henry N. Cobb, another graduate of the Harvard program. The mall, which opened on a former air field in 1956, is a vast duplex in an ocean of parking space.
Mr. Franzen's first major solo project was the fortresslike Alley Theater in Houston, which opened in 1968 for the city's resident theater company. Critics praised it as a triumph of the Brutalist style, characterized by the use of rough exterior materials like concrete. But many Houston residents hated it. One letter in The Houston Chronicle condemned the building's ''totalitarian'' aura.
Mr. Franzen applied Brutalism again in designing two 17-story concrete and glass towers for Hunter College, a branch of the City University of New York. Begun in 1972 and finished in 1984 -- after a long hiatus caused by the city's financial crisis -- the buildings stand on opposite sides of Lexington Avenue between 67th and 68th Streets. Many Upper East Side residents were surprised by the skywalks, connecting the buildings at the third and eighth floors. A third walkway links buildings over 68th Street.
''It's the one at the third-story level that's most oppressive, I think, because it's low,'' said Margot Wellington, the executive director of the Municipal Art Society, in an interview for the 2006 book ''New York 2000: Architecture and Urbanism Between the Bicentennial and the Millennium,'' by the architect Robert A. M. Stern. ''The two together,'' she said, ''take out more sky than you think.''
But as Mr. Franzen had hoped, the walkways became the central arteries of college life. Mr. Stern, who is also dean of the Yale School of Architecture, said in an interview on Wednesday that people had grown more comfortable with Mr. Franzen's work at Hunter College.
''It wasn't everybody's idea of a charming college campus experience, but it was interesting,'' he said. ''And it widened the public perception about urban space.''
Mr. Franzen's most high-profile project in New York was the world headquarters for the Philip Morris Companies, across from Grand Central Terminal at Park Avenue and 42nd Street. The tower, begun in the late 1970s and completed in 1982, carried symbolic importance.
''It was about the city's viability as a corporate center,'' said William J. Higgins, a landmarks preservation consultant.
The city had not fully emerged from its brush with bankruptcy when Philip Morris undertook the project. It was considered risky, and Mr. Franzen's design reflected the mood of both his client and the city. ''He built a concrete fortress,'' Mr. Higgins said, ''that sort of summed up the emotional landscape of New York in the '70s.''
The building, rising 26 stories, featured a novel form of public space: an enclosed sculpture gallery on the ground floor, with works from the Whitney Museum of American Art. (Philip Morris, now the Altria Group, sold the building in 2008, and the gallery closed as well.)
Mr. Franzen, who served on the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission in the 1990s, was known for his self-assurance and forceful opinions. Yet he was modest about the architect's role in making cityscapes.
''Architecture is the servant of its time,'' he said in an interview with the critic Peter Blake for a 1999 book about Mr. Franzen's work, ''and significant designs are experiments of an era. The buildings that are designed become footprints of our own sociocultural history, reflections of the ideas and concerns of an era, and not those of an individual.''
Ulrich Joseph Franzen was born in Düsseldorf, Germany, on Jan. 15, 1921. His father, Eric, was a writer and a translator of Shakespeare, his mother, the former Lisbeth Hellersberg, a psychologist. The family left Germany in 1936 and settled in New York.
After his parents divorced, Mr. Franzen lived with his mother and a younger brother, Wolfgang, in New Jersey until he entered Williams College in Massachusetts. After receiving his bachelor's degree there, he spent a semester at Harvard's architecture school before joining the Army and serving in the Office of Strategic Services. He returned to Harvard after the war and received his master's degree in 1950.
Among his other notable designs are the Harpers Ferry Center (1969) in West Virginia, designed for the National Park Service; the Harlem School of the Arts (1978) in New York; University Center, at the University of Michigan (1981) in Flint, Mich.; and the Champion International headquarters (1985) in Stamford, Conn.
He and his wife lived for many years in Rye, N.Y., in a house he designed, before retiring to Santa Fe. In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Peter and David; a daughter, April; and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Dueling Prisms For Valuing Stocks

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine.

 BODY:
AFTER the tech crash a decade ago, investors started giving closer attention to the prices they pay for stocks.
Some have turned to a tool known as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE, to determine whether stocks are cheap or expensive. Yet while this version of the P/E ratio, popularized by the Yale economist Robert J. Shiller, correctly signaled frothy markets in 1929, 1999 and 2008, some strategists argue that it may not be as accurate in gauging valuations today as it was in the past.
''There are distortions in this period of time that make it a less useful tool,'' says Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and author of ''Stocks for the Long Run.'' 
Traditional P/E ratios compare stock prices with one year's worth of historical or projected earnings. CAPE, on the other hand, looks at 10 years of averaged, or ''normalized,'' profits. Because this method tends to smooth out earnings anomalies that arise at the peak of a profit cycle or the depths of a recession, CAPE is considered a more conservative gauge.
Sometimes, the differences between traditional and normalized P/E's can lead investors to drastically different conclusions.
Based on the past 12 months of earnings, for example, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has a trailing P/E of around 15, which would make the market attractively priced based on historical levels, according to market strategists.
By contrast, the market's CAPE reading is nearly 22. Although that's not as elevated as in 1929 or '99, it is significantly higher than the market's long-run average of around 16.
''The basic idea of smoothing out earnings over time is excellent,'' Mr. Siegel says. But he points out that the current CAPE for domestic stocks includes a 90 percent annual earnings decline in the first quarter of 2009. ''You're averaging in an unbelievable hole in profits,'' he says.
JAMES STACK, president of InvesTech Research, adds that the current 10-year look back is unusual because it includes not just one but two of the worst profit recessions in history. In addition to the earnings decline stemming from the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, the bursting of the tech bubble weighed down corporate profits from 2000 through early 2003.
''Normalized earnings are fine to use if the periods you're looking at are going to be more normal,'' Mr. Stack says. ''But anyone looking at 10-year P/E's today has to realize that the past decade has been anything but normal.''
Based on CAPE, domestic stocks today ''look ultraexpensive,'' Mr. Stack says. Yet he notes that the true valuation picture may have been distorted, as corporations used the past decade's recessions ''as an opportunity to cleanse their balance sheets by writing off all nonperforming parts of their businesses.''
Mr. Shiller, who is widely credited with having warned investors about the tech crash and the more recent housing bubble, concedes that ''corporate earnings have been unusually volatile in the past decade.''
But he argues that this is more reason -- not less -- to use normalized earnings in calculating the market's P/E. ''What alternatives do people have?'' he asked in an interview. For instance, he says, if volatile swings in profits affect 10-year averages, surely they would distort P/E's based on 12 months of profits even more. (Mr. Shiller is a regular contributor to the Economic View column in Sunday Business.)
Robert D. Arnott, chairman of Research Affiliates, agrees. He notes that based on the last 12 months of profits, the Russell 1000 index -- which, like the S.& P. 500, tracks blue-chip domestic stocks -- was trading at a modest P/E ratio of around 16. ''But those were peak earnings,'' he said., adding that his firm prefers to use CAPE to remove the effects of earnings peaks and troughs.
What about the fact that the past 10 years include two major earnings anomalies that skew the market's CAPE?
''I'm grateful that there are people who believe that, who can be on the other side of my trades,'' Mr. Arnott says.
He points out that the past decade has also been witness to much monetary easing by the Federal Reserve, artificially bolstering corporate profits. Moreover, he says, ''corporate earnings are the largest share of gross domestic product since 1929, while wages are the smallest share of G.D.P. since 1937.'' Those trends are unlikely to continue forever, he says, adding that profit margins will eventually come down as the economy improves and companies start hiring more aggressively.
This isn't to say that CAPE is telling investors that it's necessarily time to sell domestic stocks. To be sure, the CAPE of the S.& P. 500 is high by historical standards. But if one's choice is between investing in domestic stocks or in 10-year Treasury notes, the equities probably still seem the better bet, Mr. Arnott says.
Mr. Shiller adds that based on more than 140 years of history, the market's CAPE would indicate that investors should expect annualized gains of just under 4 percent a year, accounting for the effects of inflation. That's worse than the long-run average of real annual returns of more than 6 percent for blue-chip stocks.
''But it's not extremely low, either,'' he says.
FOR his part, Mr. Siegel has a more bullish outlook. He argues that the market is attractively priced, considering how low interest rates are. And he says he thinks that investors will soon be willing to pay more for each dollar of corporate earnings than they are right now. Given that, he adds, domestic stocks could return 10 to 12 percent a year over the next several years -- especially if the economy begins to pick up speed.
Mr. Siegel and Mr. Shiller are old friends who have periodically disagreed about market valuations. ''Again, let me just say how much I respect my good friend Robert Shiller,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''His basic idea is excellent, but you have to consider today's circumstances.''

HEADLINE: Umenyiora Looks Beyond Next Sack, Wondering What It All Means

BYLINE: By SAM BORDEN

 BODY:
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- One day last week, the Giants' defensive linemen were discussing money in their meeting room at the team's training center. Several players had watched a television documentary about seemingly flush athletes going broke after their careers ended, and a casual conversation quickly turned more passionate.
At one point, defensive tackle Marvin Austin recalled, it was as if Osi Umenyiora were in church. Umenyiora, a veteran defensive end, was confessor and preacher -- first telling his teammates about all the mistakes he had made over the years, then imploring them to listen closely so they would never suffer the same fate. Umenyiora locked eyes with Austin, a third-year player, to emphasize his point; he turned to be sure the young star Jason Pierre-Paul could hear him. 
To outsiders, the scene would appear incongruous. Justin Tuck, the unit's captain, is the talker on defense. Chris Canty has a raw, unfiltered side to him, too. They are the emotional souls of the line. Umenyiora, a two-time Pro Bowl selection and All-Pro pass rusher, is supposed to be the sullen one, the standoffish one. He is the one who has continually engaged the team in contract disputes the past few seasons -- to the point that, by his own account, he became known to fans as ''the guy on the stationary bike'' because that is how he often spent training camp workouts.
But this label, it seems, is lacking. Countless athletes have said they are misunderstood, generally as a way to explain mistakes, and several Giants even used that word to describe Umenyiora. The difference is that Umenyiora never did.
''It isn't misunderstood,'' he said in a rare extended interview here, drawing out his words. ''That's too easy. I think, maybe, it's just -- incomplete.''
In some ways, that mystery is by design. Umenyiora's reticence with the public and the news media is not by accident. While Tuck and quarterback Eli Manning readily make themselves available in the locker room, Umenyiora generally stays away. Typically, he speaks to reporters once a week (on Fridays, when fewer are present) and when he does, he rarely ventures beyond the mundane.
''Look, it took me a whole year to get to know the guy,'' Canty said. ''When I first met him, I couldn't stand him. I'll admit that. But what people don't realize is that he is incredibly smart, incredibly thoughtful and one of the most interesting people you could ever meet.''
Canty laughed, adding, ''You just have to get him to talk to you.''
Umenyiora readily acknowledges his aversion to the spotlight.
''I won't lie to you,'' he said. ''I've wished that I wasn't in such a big market, that I could have just gone about my business and played football and been in a small corner somewhere where nobody knows anything.''
Yet his reticence is more philosophical.
Umenyiora spent his childhood in London and in his native Nigeria, then moved to the United States as a teenager. He did not play football until 11th grade, then earned a business degree from Troy University in Alabama, and developed an abiding appreciation for history, politics and religion. He recently finished reading the Bible and started the Koran. Tuck revealed that he and Umenyiora were in the midst of a long-running discussion comparing Clinton-era economics with the policies of President Obama.
Quite simply, Umenyiora said, he does not understand all the fuss about the N.F.L.
''That's the thing,'' he said, pointing two fingers at his own body. ''Look at what I do. I put on tights and go out there and try to hit someone. It's hard, but is it really important? Does it matter? Why should we get any attention at all?''
He was not being modest or feigning humility, but simply asking a question. Umenyiora will often raise broader points about a subject, regardless of how universally accepted it is, said Adewale Ogunleye, who retired from the N.F.L. in 2010 and is one of Umenyiora's closest friends.
The two once spent an inordinate amount of time, Ogunleye said, debating the merits of flying first class when an exit-row seat offered the same leg room. Umenyiora, Ogunleye recalled, was trying to be sure that Ogunleye found some value in the first-class seat as opposed to simply wanting it because he thought that is where a professional athlete should sit.
''He just doesn't accept things because they are what everyone else accepts,'' Ogunleye said. ''He needs to see the reason behind it. He needs to think about it.''
Along those lines, Ogunleye added that Umenyiora was seemingly immune to fads and trends. When a visitor recently chided Umenyiora for still having a BlackBerry in a locker room full of iPhones and Androids, he said defiantly: ''I really love this thing. Why change?'' Umenyiora also avoids designer clothes. He frequently wears dark gray Crocs sandals to and from team headquarters (to complement his gray sweat pants) and once, when Ogunleye and Umenyiora went out for a night on the town with friends, Umenyiora showed up in full Nigerian dress. Their companions were surprised, but ''that's just what he does,'' Ogunleye said.
''He wears what he wants even if some people thought it was like something out of 'Coming to America,' '' Ogunleye added. ''He doesn't care.''
When Umenyiora bows to public pressure, it rarely goes well. He recently gave in and began reading ''Fifty Shades of Grey'' (''It was like you couldn't get away from people talking about it,'' he said) but quit after just a few pages because ''the writing was just so cheesy I was like, 'Come on man, you can't do this.' ''He added, ''I didn't even get to the good parts.''
Lately, Umenyiora has found himself thinking of the future more. He will be 31 next month. He has struggled along with the rest of the defensive line over the Giants' first five games, and he is not signed beyond this season.
The notion that he is nearing the end of his career has changed his perspective. That was part of the motivation for his talk in the meeting room, he said, and he acknowledged that he now viewed his contract battles with the Giants differently.
The disputes -- which involved public posturing by each side, occasional name-calling, aborted trade attempts and a holdout, among other tactics -- dragged on acrimoniously. And when they finally ended, Umenyiora repeatedly said he had no regrets, even though he ultimately secured little in terms of money.
Now, though, his opinion has changed. He recalled a moment after the Giants won the Super Bowl last February, when a reporter approached him in the midst of the giddy celebration and wanted to know how he felt about his contract. Umenyiora's face fell.
''It was like a cloud hanging over me,'' he said. ''It was terrible. It felt like it would never go away.
''Of course I regret it,'' Umenyiora added. ''Because nothing was really accomplished out of it. I didn't really gain anything. The extra money I'm making this year? Even 10 times that wasn't worth what I had to endure.''
He laughed. ''I have a business degree, but I'm not a good businessman -- you could tell that through everything I do,'' he said. ''That contract stuff -- that was the worst thing I ever could have done.''
That is what Umenyiora told the other defensive linemen, he said, using those exact words. He believed in the principle that N.F.L. teams cut players in the middle of contracts, so players should be free to renegotiate as well, but he ''never imagined it would get so ugly.''
It was hard to acknowledge his errors, Umenyiora said, but he is changing. Lately he has talked more about family, particularly with Tuck and Ogunleye. Umenyiora ''has dated the most attractive women on the face of the Earth,'' Ogunleye said, and has a 5-year-old son, Tijani, whom he wishes he saw even more than he does. But he has never married, choosing instead to ''run around,'' as he described it.
For a long time, Umenyiora said, he believed he might never get married. His parents divorced when he was an infant and that made him ''not very easy to love,'' he said. He almost never discusses his home life.
But for a moment, he opened up. ''Your mother? Your family?'' he said. ''That's how you learn to love. I used to think I didn't need that, but now I know I do. I want that love someday, too.''
He smiled then, not sullen or surly or sour at all. Umenyiora's public image may never fully recover from the arrows of the past few off-seasons, but that does not mean he should be defined by it. He made sure to remind his teammates of that in the meeting room, too.
''I told them, 'It takes a genius to learn from other people's mistakes,' '' he said. ''It's true. Most people, they have to learn from their own.''

HEADLINE: Mondays Aren't As Blue as We Think

BYLINE: By ARTHUR A. STONE. 
Arthur A. Stone is a professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at Stony Brook University and a senior scientist at the Gallup Organization.

 BODY:
DESPITE the beating that Mondays have taken in pop songs -- Fats Domino crooned ''Blue Monday, how I hate blue Monday'' -- the day does not deserve its gloomy reputation.
Two colleagues and I recently published an analysis of a remarkable yearlong survey by the Gallup Organization, which conducted 1,000 live interviews a day, asking people across the United States to recall their mood in the prior day. We scoured the data for evidence that Monday was bluer than Tuesday or Wednesday. We couldn't find any.
Mood was evaluated with several adjectives measuring positive or negative feelings. Spanish-only speakers were queried in Spanish. Interviewers spoke to people in every state on cellphones and land lines. The data unequivocally showed that Mondays are as pleasant to Americans as the three days that follow, and only a trifle less joyful than Fridays. Perhaps no surprise, people generally felt good on the weekend -- though for retirees, the distinction between weekend and weekdays was only modest. 
Likewise, day-of-the-week mood was gender-blind. Over all, women assessed their daily moods more negatively than men did, but relative changes from day to day were similar for both sexes.
And yet still, the belief in blue Mondays persists.
Several years ago, in another study, I examined expectations about mood and day of the week: two-thirds of the sample nominated Monday as the ''worst'' day of the week. Other research has confirmed that this sentiment is widespread, despite the fact that, well, we don't really feel any gloomier on that day.
The question is, why? Why do we believe something that our own immediate experience indicates simply isn't true?
As it turns out, the blue Monday mystery highlights a phenomenon familiar to behavioral scientists: that beliefs or judgments about experience can be at odds with actual experience. Indeed, the disconnection between beliefs and experience is common.
Vacations, for example, are viewed more pleasantly after they are over compared with how they were experienced at the time. And motorists who drive fancy cars report having more fun driving than those who own more modest vehicles, though in-car monitoring shows this isn't the case. The same is often true in reverse as well: we remember pain or symptoms of illness at higher levels than real-time experience suggests, in part because we ignore symptom-free periods in between our aches and pains.
HOW do we make sense of these findings? The human brain has vast, but limited, capacities to store, retrieve and process information. Yet we are often confronted with questions that challenge these capacities. And this is often when the disconnect between belief and experience occurs. When information isn't available for answering a question -- say, when it did not make it into our memories in the first place -- we use whatever information is available, even if it isn't particularly relevant to the question at hand.
When asked about pain for the last week, most people cannot completely remember all of its ups and downs over seven days. However, we are likely to remember it at its worst and may use that as a way of summarizing pain for the entire week. When asked about our current satisfaction with life, we may focus on the first things that come to mind -- a recent spat with a spouse or maybe a compliment from the boss at work.
Several mental processes like these have been identified and are called cognitive heuristics. The so-called peak-end heuristic is particularly well researched and is the tendency to emphasize peaks and recent experience when one summarizes over a period of time.
In the case of the blue Monday belief, it is likely that heuristics are at work. Thinking that Monday is the worst day of the week may be based on our innate attention to change: the shift from pleasant Sundays to ordinary Mondays constitutes the largest change in mood over a week for a person working a typical weekday shift. So, when thinking about mood on different days of the week, we react to change rather than the absolute levels of daily mood -- a so-called contrast effect. In doing so we get it wrong, at least in terms of representing the actual mood experience in memory.
That we can so readily distort what happened in the past has far-ranging implications. Decision-making often draws on knowledge from our experiences, yet given that the memories of these can be flawed, so may be the decisions.
And there is evidence that this happens. Memories of an uncomfortable medical test, like a colonoscopy, influence whether or not such procedures are repeated in a timely manner. In the same way, faulty memory can hamper the development of pain medications. A new drug may in fact be effective in reducing daily pain levels, yet if the evaluation of the treatment is based on retrospective measures, this effect could go undetected as memories of pain-free moments are subsumed by memories of pain.
So although debunking blue Mondays provides a clearer view of daily life experience, the real value of this work comes from understanding the psychological processes that create our memories -- and the impact this has on our decisions.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Urges Leaders To Act Decisively on Debt

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- World finance officials called on the United States and Europe to quickly resolve their debt problems, saying on Saturday that more decisive action was needed to restore confidence in the faltering global economy.
In a communiqué at the end of a three-day meeting here in Tokyo, the members of the International Monetary Fund warned that global growth was slowing as the persistent debt crises in developed countries dragged down growth in emerging markets. The statement said quick action was needed to ''break negative feedback loops and restore the global economy to a path of strong, sustainable and balanced growth.''
''There was no objection to the recommendation that we gave to the membership, which was a-c-t,'' said the I.M.F. head, Christine Lagarde, spelling out the word for dramatic emphasis. 
The annual meetings here of the I.M.F. and the World Bank were focused on the harm to the world economy from the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, and the prospect of automatic budget cuts and tax increases in the United States at the end of the year as American political leaders remain deadlocked over how to reduce deficits.
The I.M.F. warned that economic stagnation in richer countries hurt poorer ones, which rely on exports to the developed world to lift themselves out of poverty. Its members also cautioned that the slowdown in the West was hurting growth in Asia, now the world's most dynamic economic region.
''Asia alone can't carry the global economy,'' the Australian treasurer, Wayne Swan, was quoted as saying by Reuters. ''It is time for the other players to get off the benches and start to pull their weight on global economic growth again.''
The I.M.F. meeting was overshadowed at times by a different sort of problem that economists warn could also hurt growth in Asia: the region's many territorial disputes. The finance minister and the central bank chief of China, Asia's largest economy, skipped the meetings in a show of displeasure with their host, Japan, with which China is locked in an emotional dispute over control of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.
The news at the meetings was not all bad. Some I.M.F. members said that global growth prospects were brighter now than six months ago, citing European progress toward containing the Continent's debt crisis. But the group also said that growth was still slowing, because of the developed world's debt problems and other lingering effects from the global financial crisis.
Much of the discussion at the I.M.F. meeting focused on the risks that the United States, the world's largest economy, might face if the Obama administration and Congress cannot agree on deficit reduction measures, setting off legally mandated tax increases and federal spending cuts early next year. Hitting that ''fiscal cliff'' would reduce growth and eliminate jobs at a time when the anemic American economy is still struggling to recover from the 2008 crisis.
The scale of America's fiscal problems was underscored just hours before the meeting in Tokyo, when the Obama administration announced that the budget deficit this year would reach $1.1 trillion, exceeding $1 trillion for a fourth straight year. While that is down from last year, United States deficits had never topped half a trillion dollars before the 2008 financial crisis.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said Saturday that the United States had made progress in fixing its debt problems, but still faced a long road ahead.
''It is important that we in the U.S. enact a balanced framework to bring down our fiscal deficit and debt over several years, while continuing to provide support for jobs and growth in the short term,'' he was quoted as saying by The Associated Press.

HEADLINE: A Possibly Fatal Mistake

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
MY wife and I attended my 30-year college reunion a couple of weekends ago, but the partying was bittersweet. My freshman roommate, Scott Androes, was in a Seattle hospital bed, a victim in part of a broken health care system. Strip away the sound and fury of campaign ads and rival spinmeisters, and what's at stake in this presidential election is, in part, lives like Scott's.
Scott and I were both Oregon farm boys, friends through the Future Farmers of America, when Harvard sent us thick envelopes. We were exhilarated but nervous, for neither of us had ever actually visited Harvard, and we asked to room together for moral support among all those city slickers.
We were the country bumpkins of Harvard Yard. Yet if we amused our classmates more than we intended, we had our private jokes as well. We let slip (falsely) that we kept deer rifles under our beds and smiled as our friends gave them a wide berth. 
Scott was there when I limped back from the Worst Date in History (quite regularly), and he and I together worked our way onto the Crimson, the student newspaper. He had an omnivorous mind: Scott may be the only champion judge of dairy cattle who enjoyed quoting Thomas Macaulay, the 19th-century British historian. Scott topped off his erudition with a crackling wit to deflate pretentiousness (which, at Harvard, kept him busy).
By nature, Scott was even-keeled, prudent and cautious, and he always looked like the mild-mannered financial consultant that he became. He never lost his temper, never drove too fast, never got drunk, never smoked marijuana.
Well, not that I remember. I don't want to discredit his youth.
Yet for all his innate prudence, Scott now, at age 52, is suffering from Stage 4 prostate cancer, in part because he didn't have health insurance. President Obama's health care reform came just a bit too late to help Scott, but it will protect others like him -- unless Mitt Romney repeals it.
If you favor gutting ''Obamacare,'' please listen to Scott's story. He is willing to recount his embarrassing tale in part so that readers can learn from it.
I'll let Scott take over the narrative:
It all started in December 2003 when I quit my job as a pension consultant in a fit of midlife crisis. For the next year I did little besides read books I'd always wanted to read and play poker in the local card rooms.
I didn't buy health insurance because I knew it would be really expensive in the individual policy market, because many of the people in this market are high risk. I would have bought insurance if there had been any kind of fair-risk pooling. In 2005 I started working seasonally for H&R Block doing tax returns.
As seasonal work it of course doesn't provide health benefits, but then lots of full-time jobs don't either. I knew I was taking a big risk without insurance, but I was foolish.
In 2011 I began having greater difficulty peeing. I didn't go see the doctor because that would have been several hundred dollars out of pocket -- just enough disincentive to get me to make a bad decision.
Early this year, I began seeing blood in my urine, and then I got scared. I Googled ''blood in urine'' and turned up several possible explanations. I remember sitting at my computer and thinking, ''Well, I can afford the cost of an infection, but cancer would probably bust my bank and take everything in my I.R.A. So I'm just going to bet on this being an infection.''
I was extremely busy at work since it was peak tax season, so I figured I'd go after April 15. Then I developed a 102-degree fever and went to one of those urgent care clinics in a strip mall. (I didn't have a regular physician and hadn't been getting annual physicals.)
The doctor there gave me a diagnosis of prostate infection and prescribed antibiotics. That seemed to help, but by April 15 it seemed to be getting worse again. On May 3 I saw a urologist, and he drew blood for tests, but the results weren't back yet that weekend when my health degenerated rapidly.
A friend took me to the Swedish Medical Center Emergency Room near my home. Doctors ran blood labs immediately. A normal P.S.A. test for prostate cancer is below 4, and mine was 1,100. They also did a CT scan, which turned up possible signs of cancerous bone lesions. Prostate cancer likes to spread to bones.
I also had a blood disorder called disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is sometimes brought on by prostate cancer. It basically causes you to destroy your own blood cells, and it's abbreviated as D.I.C. Medical students joke that it stands for ''death is close.''
Let's just stipulate up front that Scott blew it. Other people are sometimes too poor to buy health insurance or unschooled about the risks. Scott had no excuse. He could have afforded insurance, and while working in the pension industry he became expert on actuarial statistics; he knew precisely what risks he was taking. He's the first to admit that he screwed up catastrophically and may die as a result.
Yet remember also that while Scott was foolish, mostly he was unlucky. He is a bachelor, so he didn't have a spouse whose insurance he could fall back on in his midlife crisis. In any case, we all take risks, and usually we get away with them. Scott is a usually prudent guy who took a chance, and then everything went wrong.
The Mitt Romney philosophy, as I understand it, is that this is a tragic but necessary byproduct of requiring Americans to take personal responsibility for their lives. They need to understand that mistakes have consequences. That's why Romney would repeal Obamacare and leave people like Scott to pay the price for their irresponsibility.
To me, that seems ineffably harsh. We all make mistakes, and a humane government tries to compensate for our misjudgments. That's why highways have guardrails, why drivers must wear seat belts, why police officers pull over speeders, why we have fire codes. In other modern countries, Scott would have been insured, and his cancer would have been much more likely to be detected in time for effective treatment.
Is that a nanny state? No, it's a civilized one.
President Obama's care plan addresses this problem inelegantly, by forcing people like Scott to buy insurance beginning in 2014. Some will grumble about the ''mandate'' and the insurance cost, but it will save lives.
Already, Obamacare is slowly reducing the number of people without health insurance, as young adults can now stay on their parents' plans. But the Census Bureau reported last month that 48.6 million Americans are still uninsured -- a travesty in a wealthy country. The Urban Institute calculated in 2008 that some 27,000 Americans between the ages of 25 and 65 die prematurely each year because they don't have health insurance. Another estimate is even higher.
You want to put a face on those numbers? Look at Scott's picture. One American like him dies every 20 minutes for lack of health insurance.
Back to Scott:
For seven weeks they kept me alive with daily blood transfusions. They also gave me chemotherapy, suppressing the cancer so that my blood could return to normal. I was released June 29, and since then have had more chemo and also hormone therapy to limit the cancer growth.
But the cancer has kept growing, and I went to the E.R. again on Sept. 17 when I found that I was losing all strength in my legs. They did an M.R.I. and saw that there were tumors pressing on my spinal cord. They have been treating me with radiation for three weeks now to shrink those tumors and will continue to do so for another week.
I submitted an application to the hospital for charity care and was approved. The bill is already north of $550,000. Based on the low income on my tax return they knocked it down to $1,339. Swedish Medical Center has treated me better than I ever deserved.
Some doctor bills are not covered by the charity application, and I expect to spend all of my I.R.A. assets before I'm done. Some doctors have been generously treating me without sending bills, and I am humbled by their ethic of service to the patient.
Some things I have to pay for, like $1,700 for the Lupron hormone therapy and $1,400 for an ambulance trip. It's an arbitrary and haphazard system, and I'm just lucky to live in a city with a highly competent and generous hospital like Swedish.
In this respect, Scott is very lucky, and the system is now responding superbly and compassionately. But of course, his care is not exactly ''free'' -- we're all paying the bill.
Romney argues that Obamacare is economically inefficient. But where is the efficiency in a system that neglects routine physicals and preventive care, and then pays $550,000 in bills as a result? To me, this is repugnant economically as well as morally.
In the Romney system, people like Scott would remain uninsured. And they would be unable to buy insurance because of their cancer history.
Obamacare does address these problems, albeit in a complex and intrusive way, forcing people by a mandate to get insurance. Some will certainly fall through the cracks, and in any case the Obama plan does little to address the underlying problem of rising health costs. But do we really prefer the previous system in which one American in six was uninsured like Scott, all walking the tightrope, and sometimes falling off?
As my classmates and I celebrated our reunion and relived our triumphs -- like spiking the punch during a visit by the governor -- I kept thinking of Scott in his hospital bed. No amount of nostalgic laughter could fill the void of his absence.
Back to Scott:
This whole experience has made me feel like such a fool. I blew one that I really should have gotten right. You probably remember that my mother died of breast cancer the July before we started college. She watched my high school graduation from the back of an ambulance on the football field at our outdoor graduation. Six weeks later she was dead, and six weeks after that I was on an airplane that took me east of the Mississippi for the first time in my life.
Her death at 53 permanently darkened my view of life. It also made me feel that I was at high risk for cancer because in my amateur opinion I was genetically very similar to her, just based on appearance and personality. And much of my career has been in actuarial work, where the whole point is to identify risks.
I read Nassim Taleb's book ''The Black Swan'' and imbibed his idea that you should keep an eye out for low-probability events that have potentially big consequences, both positive and negative. You insure against the potentially negative ones, like prostate cancer.
So why didn't I get physicals? Why didn't I get P.S.A. tests? Why didn't I get examined when I started having trouble urinating? Partly because of the traditional male delinquency about seeing doctors. I had no regular family doctor; typical bachelor guy behavior.
I had plenty of warning signs, and that's why I feel like a damned fool. I would give anything to have gone to a doctor in, say, October 2011. It fills me with regret. Now I'm struggling with all my might to walk 30 feet down the hallway with the physical therapists holding on to me so I don't fall. I've got all my chips bet on the hope that the radiation treatments that I'm getting daily are going to shrink the tumors that are pressing on my spinal cord so that someday soon I can be back out on the sidewalk enjoying a walk in my neighborhood. That would be the height of joy for me.
When I make mistakes, my wife and friends forgive me. We need a health care system that is equally forgiving.
That means getting all Americans insured, and then emphasizing preventive care like cancer screenings. Presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt have sought to create universal health insurance, and Obama finally saw it achieved in his first term. It will gradually come into effect, with 2014 the pivotal year -- if Romney does not repeal it.
In some ways, of course, America's health care system is superb. It is masterly in pioneering new techniques, and its top-level care for those with insurance is unrivaled. Sometimes even those without insurance, like Scott, get superb care as charity cases, and I salute the doctors at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle for their professionalism and compassion toward my old friend.
But it would have made more sense to provide Scott with insurance and regular physicals. Catching the cancer early might have saved hundreds of thousands of dollars in radiation and chemo expenses -- and maybe a life as well.
So as you watch the presidential debates, as you listen to those campaign ads, remember that what is at stake is not so much the success of one politician or another. The real impact of the election will be felt in the lives of men and women around the country, in spheres as intimate as our gut-wrenching fear when we spot blood in our urine.
Our choices this election come too late for Scott, although I hope that my friend from tiny Silverton, Ore., who somehow beat the odds so many times already in his life, will also beat this cancer. The election has the potential to help save the lives of many others who don't have insurance.
In his hospital room, my old pal is gallantly fighting his cancer -- and battling a gnawing uncertainty that he should never have had to face, that no American should so needlessly endure. This is all heartbreakingly unnecessary. I'll give Scott the final word.
From my 12th floor room I have a panoramic view looking east from downtown Seattle toward the suburbs to the Cascade Mountains. My visitors are often struck by the view.
Through my window I watch a succession of gloriously sunny days and I wonder if this will be my last Indian summer on earth. I still have hope and I tell myself that medical science has come a long way in the 34 years since my mother died, but I can't help feeling that I'm walking in her footsteps.

HEADLINE: Rethinking Affirmative Action

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Washington
THE founding principle of affirmative action was fairness. After years of oppression, it seemed folly to judge blacks by the same measures as whites.
''You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race,'' President Lyndon B. Johnson said in a 1965 speech that laid the groundwork for affirmative action, ''and then say, 'You are free to compete with all the others,' and still justly believe that you have been completely fair.''
Given this history, it was striking to watch the 80 minutes of Supreme Court oral arguments about affirmative action on Wednesday. With the courtroom overflowing, filled with people who have spent their careers fighting for or against affirmative action, only one side talked about fairness. And it was not the side defending affirmative action.
The lawyer for Abigail Fisher, a young white woman rejected by the University of Texas, argued that she had been denied equal treatment. The conservative justices, sympathetic to Ms. Fisher's case, expressed particular concern that affluent black students were receiving preferential treatment. 
Nobody on the other side -- not the university's lawyer, not the Obama administration's, not the liberal justices -- responded by talking about the obstacles that black and Latino students must overcome. The defenders of affirmative action spoke instead about the value of diversity. Without diverse college classes, they argued, students will learn less and society will lack for future leaders.
The decision to emphasize diversity over fairness is one that affirmative-action proponents made long before Wednesday, and it is a big reason they find themselves in such a vulnerable position today.
Americans value diversity. But they value fairness more. Most people oppose a college's or employer's rejecting an applicant who appears qualified for the sake of creating a group that demographically resembles the country.
With affirmative action boiled down to a diversity program, it finds itself in retreat. Five of the six states that have held referendums on racial preferences have banned them, including California and Florida. The Supreme Court limited the legal forms of preferences in 2003 and suggested that they had only 25 years left. Based on last week's oral arguments, and the fact that Justice Anthony Kennedy has never voted to uphold preferences, the court may restrict them further or forbid them.
Yet supporters of affirmative action do not necessarily need to despair. They still have a path open to them, one that remains legal and popular. It involves resurrecting Johnson's vision of an affirmative action program based on fairness, which the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. also favored.
The crucial choice that affirmative-action proponents made long ago was to focus the program on race rather than more broadly on disadvantage.
There were some obvious reasons to do so. Americans have never been comfortable talking about class. It reeks of the social order the country rejected at its founding (Britain's) and of the economic system the country spent decades fighting (communism). But race was an undeniably American problem, from slavery to civil rights to the discrimination that, according to voluminous social-science research, lingers.
By forgoing a broader view of disadvantage, colleges lost the ability to claim that their overriding goal was meritocracy. ''That was the key moment, when they forfeited fairness,'' Richard D. Kahlenberg of the Century Foundation, who has written a book about affirmative action, told me.
Institutions using affirmative action could not claim to be bringing everybody -- rich and poor, white and black, native and immigrant -- up to the same starting line, in Mr. Johnson's formulation. They instead were creating a system that depended on racial categories.
From a legal perspective, the decision made the supporters' task harder. The very laws intended to address the country's racial history set a high bar for any race-based system. In its first major affirmative-action ruling, the Bakke case of 1978, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that society-wide discrimination justified preferences for individuals. The court reaffirmed that finding in 2003, while also reaffirming that diversity was a legitimate rationale.
It is impossible to know whether affirmative action could have had a more enduring foundation were it based on a broader equal-opportunity approach. Proponents never tried this alternative. Courts, however, have consistently upheld socioeconomic preferences. Had black and Latino students been benefiting from those preferences, as many would, at least some portion of affirmative action might be in less peril.
But the liberals behind the great successes of the civil rights and women's movements never showed as much interest in economic diversity. On college campuses, administrators have insisted for years that they care about disadvantage, beyond race, but they have done relatively little about it. They have preferred a version of diversity focused on elites from every race.
Black and Latino college applicants, as well as athletes and so-called legacies, receive large preferences -- the equivalent of 150 to 300 SAT points. Low-income students, controlling for race, receive either no preference or a modest one, depending on which study you believe. At the country's 200 most selective colleges, a mere 5 percent of students come from the bottom 25 percent of the income spectrum, according to Anthony P. Carnevale of Georgetown. In court on Wednesday, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. attacked the political underbelly of this system. The University of Texas argued that diversity within racial groups was also important, citing ''the African-American or Hispanic child of successful professionals in Dallas.'' Skeptically, Justice Alito asked the university's lawyer, ''They deserve a leg up against, let's say, an Asian or a white applicant whose parents are absolutely average?''
Justice Kennedy followed up by telling the lawyer, in one of the most quoted lines of the day, ''So what you're saying is that what counts is race above all.''
Even in California, which has banned racial preferences, race can still dominate the debate. Richard H. Sander, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, has found some hard-to-explain patterns in U.C.L.A.'s undergraduate admissions. The college has accepted a significantly higher percentage of blacks and Latinos than whites and Asians with the same ''holistic score,'' a number the admissions office gives to every applicant, based on test scores, grades, extracurricular activities and obstacles overcome. U.C.L.A. officials say that the holistic scores do not fully capture the obstacles some students face.
Back in the 1960s, Dr. King understood the vulnerability of today's affirmative action. ''Many white workers whose economic condition is not too far removed from the economic condition of his black brother will find it difficult to accept,'' he wrote in a private letter, ''special consideration to the Negro in the context of unemployment, joblessness, etc. and does not take into sufficient account their plight (that of the white worker).''
If the courts and voters continue to restrict racial preferences, supporters will have three options. They can give up, which is unlikely. They can quietly subvert the law, as some critics, like Mr. Sander, believe is happening in California. Or they can attempt an overhaul of affirmative action.
The economic argument for a different version has only become stronger over time. Outright racism certainly exists, and colleges would have a hard time taking it into account if race-based affirmative action became illegal. But simple discrimination seems to have become a relatively smaller obstacle over the last few decades, while socioeconomic disadvantage has become a larger one.
The title of a recent paper by Roland G. Fryer Jr., a Harvard economist, summarizes the trends: ''Racial inequality in the 21st century: The declining significance of discrimination.''
Racial gaps remain large enough that colleges would struggle to recruit as many black and Latino students without explicitly taking race into account. But some experts, like Mr. Kahlenberg, think they could come close. To do so, they would need to consider not just income, but also wealth, family structure and neighborhood poverty. Those factors disproportionately afflict black and Latino students -- and hold back children from life's starting line.
Mr. Kahlenberg argues that wealth is especially defensible, because it can capture discrimination's intergenerational effects. Some universities in states where racial preferences are banned, including California, have begun taking small steps to consider class more fully.
Until the Supreme Court rules, sometime next year, the focus will be on its decision. And its decision matters. Yet the choices that universities make matter, too. You wouldn't have known it from sitting in the courtroom, but there is a version of affirmative action -- legal, generally popular and arguably more meritocratic -- that higher education has not yet even tried.

HEADLINE: Afghan Boys Eke Living Amid Peril At Gorge

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY; Sangar Rahimi contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MAHI PAR PASS, Afghanistan -- Beneath the soaring faces of rock, on a treacherous road flanked by gaping drops, lines of trucks crawled up from the Pakistani border, groaning under impossible loads of house-size metal containers and boxes tottering under tarps.
Past them and between them nudged cars, vans and other trucks carrying furniture, women in burqas, open loads of cows and donkeys.
Amid the tidal wave of traffic, piercing the cacophony with their yelps and whistles, stood the Pepsi bottle boys. They earn their meager living by keeping the contractor trucks flowing on this section of the Jalalabad road, one of the main NATO supply routes to Kabul and one of Afghanistan's deadliest stretches of road.
''I don't like it, but I have to work and make some money,'' said one of the boys, Samiullah, a grimy-faced 12-year-old wearing a red baseball cap. 
He was guiding traffic at one of the scariest hairpin bends, where cars rushed two abreast down from a tunnel through the mountain and three rusted tankers lay upside down in the gorge below. ''I can get killed at any time.''
Like all of the children on this road, Samiullah waved a flattened plastic soft drink bottle, the only tool of trade for these self-appointed traffic police.
The bottle was a symbol of his poverty; these children possess almost nothing else in the world. And it was also a signal to the truck drivers that they might want to toss a few afghanis down to him in return.
''Without us there would be a car crashed every day,'' he said.
The war economy touches everybody in Afghanistan and will leave a desperate hole when it is gone -- not least for the Pepsi bottle boys, a prime example of how Afghans have fit their lives around America's military presence here.
These children flock from the bazaars of Pul-i-Charkhi in the poor eastern suburbs of Kabul to work for a few infernal hours on the Mahi Par Pass, but it is better than anything else they could have.
Late last year, they began to experience what life may be like after the Americans leave in 2014.
When Pakistan closed the border to NATO supply trucks in November, the trucks stopped coming, and business for these children slowed to almost nothing. Suddenly, they were out of jobs.
''Business was very low at the time,'' said one young man, Ziaullah, who did not know his age but looked about 20. He cut a lonely figure in a dirty green tunic amid billowing fumes on the edge of the cracked road.
''It hurt our business a lot, because usually the drivers of the trucks are paying us money, not the small cars; they usually pay 10 to 20 Pakistani rupees,'' or 10 or 20 cents, he said. ''At that time I was earning 100 to 150 afghanis a day,'' $2 to $3, ''so I was dividing the money for different things: 50 for bread, 50 for sugar.''
Pakistan reopened the border in July, and the NATO supply convoys, driven by Pakistani and Afghan contractors, have resumed.
''I am happy if the road is open,'' Ziaullah said. ''It is good for my business and my family.'' Ziaullah is the only person in his family who has a job, and he works so that his five brothers can go to school.
All of the boys up and down this five-mile stretch of winding switchback about 45 minutes east of Kabul tell life stories of deprivation and crushing poverty.
Samiullah has worked here every day for five years since his father was paralyzed and a family enemy killed his elder brother. His friend Jan Agha, 13, a quiet boy with a sad, dirty face, lost both his mother and father.
Not all of the Pepsi bottle boys are actually children.
Mohammedullah, 70, whose face is as craggy as the mountain rock looming above him, lost a leg in a mine blast during the Taliban's rule. Now he perches by one of the curving tunnels for six days a week, taking only Fridays off.
He said the drivers are crazy, and if they ignore his advice and the road gets blocked, even for a short time, ''it is like the end of the world here.''
''The small cars occasionally give me money, but sometime if I am lucky to catch a good and rich businessman or governor or a big military officer, then I am calling my home and telling them to cook meat soup,'' he said. ''That day my luck is flying in the sky.''
Two months ago he did not come to the road for 10 days because he had to take a family member to the hospital, and when he returned someone had taken his spot.
With the help of some soldiers and a local stall keeper, he persuaded the interloper to go farther down the mountain.
''It is like a chain,'' he said. ''Everyone gets his part of the chain.''
Most of the traffic shunters, old and young, seemed to resent their hard existence.
But not Ihsanullah, 10, another boy who stood on a high arc of road so steep the trucks struggled to a standstill and looked as though they were about to tumble backward.
A small, plump boy with a beaming face, wearing dirty sandals and a dirty gray tunic, he sported a luminous green traffic policeman's vest and gave himself the name Traffic. He said he had been working on the same spot since he was 6.
Every day, he arrives here at 5 a.m., leaves for school at 8 a.m., and then returns in the afternoon, though sometimes his head is ''twisting'' from the fumes and noise, he said.
He pays 10 afghanis for a bus from his house in Pul-i-Charkhi to the Jalalabad station and then jumped a ride with the truckers.
His father, a watchmaker, died two years ago from diabetes. He gives the money he earns to his mother, who divides it among his four sisters and three brothers.
American military vehicles drive this road, but he said they usually do not give him money, only Pepsi, cookies and chocolates. It is the bigger commercial trucks that give him cash, though on this day he had gotten nothing.
When a truck nosed around the corner, Ihsanullah grew excited, striding out between the cars, waving his green plastic bottle, whistling the traffic around it.
''Go, go, go!'' he cried. But the cars sped by without stopping.
Then a minibus driver held a note from a window. Another truck driver tossed a 10 Pakistani rupee note into the air with a wave.
Ihsanullah scuttled and swept it up. He strode back, his chubby face lighted up. ''If I am not here for a few minutes or one or two or three days, then I miss being here. I enjoy being with my friends,'' he said, turning back as another brightly painted truck growled over the hill. ''I love it.''

HEADLINE: Which Millionaire Are You Voting For?

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CARNES. 
An assistant professor of public policy at Duke University and author of the forthcoming book ''White-Collar Government: How Class-Imbalanced Legislatures Distort Economic Policy-Making in the United States.''

 BODY:
ELECTIONS are supposed to give us choices. We can reward incumbents or we can throw the bums out. We can choose Republicans or Democrats. We can choose conservative policies or progressive ones.
In most elections, however, we don't get a say in something important: whether we're governed by the rich. By Election Day, that choice has usually been made for us. Would you like to be represented by a millionaire lawyer or a millionaire businessman? Even in our great democracy, we rarely have the option to put someone in office who isn't part of the elite.
Of course, many white-collar candidates care deeply about working-class Americans, those who earn a living in manual labor or service-industry jobs. Many are only a generation or two removed from relatives who worked in those fields. But why do so few elections feature candidates who have worked in blue-collar jobs themselves, at least for part of their lives? The working class is the backbone of our society, a majority of our labor force and 90 million people strong. Could it really be that not one former blue-collar worker is qualified to be president? 
My research examines how the shortage of working-class people in public office affects our democracy and why there are so few former blue-collar workers in government in the first place. The data I've studied suggest that the working class itself probably isn't the problem. It's true that workers tend to score a little lower on standard measures of political knowledge and civic engagement. But there are many more workers than there are, say, lawyers -- so many more, in fact, that there are probably more blue-collar Americans with the qualities we might want in our candidates than there are lawyers with those traits. If even only half a percent of blue-collar workers have what it takes to govern, there would still be enough of them to fill every seat in Congress and in every state legislature more than 40 times -- with enough left over to run thousands of City Councils.
Something other than qualifications seems to be screening out people with serious experience in the working class long before Election Day. Scholars haven't yet confirmed exactly what that is. (Campaign money? Free time? Party gatekeepers?) But we're starting to appreciate the seriousness of the problem.
If millionaires were a political party, that party would make up roughly 3 percent of American families, but it would have a super-majority in the Senate, a majority in the House, a majority on the Supreme Court and a man in the White House. If working-class Americans were a political party, that party would have made up more than half the country since the start of the 20th century. But legislators from that party (those who last worked in blue-collar jobs before entering politics) would never have held more than 2 percent of the seats in Congress.
And these trends don't stop at the federal level. Since the 1980s, the number of state legislators whose primary occupations are working-class jobs has fallen from 5 percent to 3 percent. In City Councils, fewer than 10 percent of members have blue-collar day jobs. Everywhere we look in government, almost no one with personal experience in working-class jobs has a seat at the table.
Their absence, moreover, has real consequences. Lawmakers from different classes tend to bring different perspectives to public office. John Boehner is fond of saying that he's a small-business man at heart and that ''It gave me a perspective on our country that I've carried with me throughout my time in public service.'' And he's right. Former businesspeople in government tend to think like businesspeople, former lawyers tend to think like lawyers, and (the few) former blue-collar workers tend to think like blue-collar workers. Edward Beard, a house painter from Providence, R.I., who was elected to Congress in 1974, always carried a paintbrush with him and tacked one to the wall outside of his Washington office -- as a ''symbol of who I am and where I'm from, the working people.''
Former house painters are the exception in Congress, of course. And although there are many white-collar lawmakers with good intentions, with so few leaders with experience in working-class jobs (from 1999 to 2008, the average member of Congress had spent 1.5 percent of his or her adult life in working-class jobs), economic policy routinely tilts toward outcomes that help white-collar professionals at the expense of the working class. Social safety net programs are stingier, business regulations are flimsier, tax policies are more regressive, and protections for workers are weaker than they would be if our lawmakers came from the same mix of classes as the people they represent.
The key is finding more lawmakers like Mr. Beard, politically adept working-class Americans. Or people like Representative Stephen Lynch, who worked as an ironworker in Boston for nearly two decades before attending law school and becoming a legal advocate for workers -- politicians who worked their way up to white-collar jobs but who still remember what it's like to push a broom.
My experience suggests that finding them will be the easy part. The hard part will be persuading the people with resources to help them. Many political gatekeepers still cling to myths about how there's something ''the matter with Kansas,'' how workers are too backward to know what's best for themselves politically. And people who value political equality already have their hands full with big challenges: mainly, the explosion of money and interest groups in Washington, and the large social class gaps in routine forms of political participation, including voting.
Even if we somehow stem the tide of money in Washington, even if we guarantee equal participation on Election Day, millionaires will still get to set the tax rate for millionaires. White-collar professionals will still get to set the minimum wage for blue-collar workers. People who have always had health insurance will still get to decide whether to help people without it. If we want government for the people, we've got to start working toward government by the people. The 2012 election offers us a stark choice between two very different approaches to economic policy. But it's still a choice between two Harvard-educated millionaires. Even in an election that is supposed to be about the future of our economy, we don't have a working-class option in the voting booth.
It's time for citizens who care about political equality to start investing in working-class candidates. We know how to do this. In 1945, the House and the Senate were each 98 percent men. In the decades since, party leaders and interest groups have deliberately recruited many female candidates, and today women make up 17 percent of Congress.
If the old boys' club isn't invincible, the Millionaires Party probably isn't, either. Changes like these aren't rocket science. They just take a little hard work.

HEADLINE: V.A. Loans Surge in Fiscal Year

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
MORTGAGES guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs surged by 50 percent in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, as tighter credit standards on conventional financing made these programs all the more attractive to current and former military members.
The department guaranteed almost 540,000 loans in fiscal year 2012, the most since 1994, according to Mike Frueh, the director of loan guarantee service. Compared with five years ago, volume is up some 300 percent.
Low interest rates were part of the draw -- about 338,000 of the V.A. loans were for the purpose of refinancing. 
Borrowers who already have a V.A.-backed mortgage can get an interest-rate reduction relatively easily. The department's streamlined refinance program doesn't require these borrowers to ''re-prove'' that they qualify, said Nathan Long, the chief executive of Veterans United Home Loans, an online broker of V.A. loans.
''It's a great benefit not to have to go through all the hoops that you would otherwise have to,'' Mr. Long said.
V.A. loans for purchases were up almost 10 percent over the previous fiscal year. For military members who qualify, these home loans offer a financing option that has largely disappeared since the subprime meltdown: no down payment.
''Regardless of where home prices are,'' Mr. Long said, ''100 percent financing can be a great option for people. We've seen 9 in 10 of our borrowers use the full 100 percent.''
Borrowers also benefit in that they don't have to pay for mortgage insurance. The department does place limits on loan amounts it will guarantee. These range from $417,000 to $1.094 million, depending on the property's location. In the New York metropolitan area, the limit is $777,500.
The department doesn't finance its loan programs, but makes them attractive to lenders by guaranteeing a portion of each loan. Individual lenders set the closing costs and the interest rates, which are currently comparable to those on conventional fixed-rate loans. The minimum credit score required to qualify for a V.A. loan is about 620.
Borrowers must also demonstrate that they will have enough monthly income left over after paying personal debts and housing costs to meet levels set by the department for ''residual income.'' In the Northeast, for loan amounts exceeding $80,000, the residual income level for a family of four is $1,025.
These underwriting standards, while exclusive to the Department of Veterans Affairs, have helped keep the foreclosure rate on its loans much lower than on other loan types, Mr. Long said.
Grant Moon, an Army Reserves captain who served in Iraq, used a V.A. loan to buy his first home, a three-family in Massachusetts, in 2008. He put no money down, and used the rental income to help cover his mortgage.
''I moved in and I was only paying about $300 a month to have my own home,'' he said.
Mr. Moon (who has since bought another V.A.-backed house in New Jersey) is now the president of VA Loan Captain, an online service that allows veterans to compare interest rates and terms among lenders.
''We prescreen the lenders and make sure they aren't trying to take advantage of veterans,'' he said.
While V.A. loans can be beneficial to military members with few assets, they are not always the best option. Although the V.A. doesn't require mortgage insurance, it does charge a funding fee, which can cost more than 3 percent of the loan amount. Paying that fee might not be prudent for a borrower who plans to be in the home for a short period of time, Mr. Moon said.
Disabled veterans may be exempt from the fee.
Given the growing popularity of V.A. loans, the department expects to hit a major milestone this month, when it will very likely guarantee its 20 millionth veteran.

HEADLINE: Do Not Track? Advertisers Say 'Don't Tread on Us'

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
THE campaign to defang the ''Do Not Track'' movement began late last month.
Do Not Track mechanisms are features on browsers -- like Mozilla's Firefox -- that give consumers the option of sending out digital signals asking companies to stop collecting information about their online activities for purposes of targeted advertising.
First came a stern letter from nine members of the House of Representatives to the Federal Trade Commission, questioning its involvement with an international group called the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, which is trying to work out global standards for the don't-track-me features. The legislators said they were concerned that these options for consumers might restrict ''the flow of data at the heart of the Internet's success.'' 
Next came an incensed open letter from the board of the Association of National Advertisers to Steve Ballmer, the C.E.O. of Microsoft, and two other company officials. Microsoft had committed a grievous infraction, wrote executives from Dell, I.B.M., Intel, Visa, Verizon, Wal-Mart and other major corporations, by making Do Not Track the default option in the company's forthcoming Internet Explorer 10 browser. If consumers chose to stay with that option, the letter warned, they could prevent companies from collecting data on up to 43 percent of browsers used by Americans.
''Microsoft's action is wrong. The entire media ecosystem has condemned this action,'' the letter said. ''In the face of this opposition and the reality of the harm that your actions could create, it is time to realign with the broader business community by providing choice through a default of 'off' on your browser's 'do not track' setting.''
So far, Microsoft has shrugged off advertisers' complaints. In an e-mailed statement, Brendon Lynch, Microsoft's chief privacy officer, said a recent company study of computer users in the United States and Europe concluded that 75 percent wanted Microsoft to turn on the Do Not Track mechanism.
''Consumers want and expect strong privacy protection to be built into Microsoft products and services,'' Mr. Lynch wrote.
The tone of the industry offensive may seem a bit strident, given that the W3C has yet to decide how to implement the don't-track-me mechanisms -- or even what they signify. For the moment, that means the browser buttons are little more than digital bumper stickers whose sentiments companies are free to embrace or entirely ignore.
But what is really at stake here is the future of the surveillance economy.
The advent of Do Not Track threatens the barter system wherein consumers allow sites and third-party ad networks to collect information about their online activities in exchange for open access to maps, e-mail, games, music, social networks and whatnot. Marketers have been fighting to preserve this arrangement, saying that collecting consumer data powers effective advertising tailored to a user's tastes. In turn, according to this argument, those tailored ads enable smaller sites to thrive and provide rich content.
''If we do away with this relevant advertising, we are going to make the Internet less diverse, less economically successful, and frankly, less interesting,'' says Mike Zaneis, the general counsel for the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an industry group.
But privacy advocates argue that in a digital ecosystem where there may be dozens of third-party entities on an individual Web page, compiling and storing information about what a user reads, searches for, clicks on or buys, consumers should understand data mining's potential costs to them and have the ability to opt out.
''If you are looking up the word 'cancer' '' on a health site, says Dan Auerbach, a staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group in San Francisco, ''there's a high probability that you have cancer or are interested in that. This is the sort of data that can be collected.'' He adds: ''Consumers absolutely have a right to know how their information is being used and to opt out of having their information used in ways they don't like.''
But the two sides seem to have reached an impasse. When the W3C met recently in Amsterdam to hammer out Do Not Track standards, as my colleague Kevin J. O'Brien reported in an article earlier this month, advertising industry executives and privacy advocates accused each other of trying to stymie the process.
''There is a strong concern that the W3C is not the right forum to be making this decision,'' says Rachel Thomas, the vice president of government affairs at the Direct Marketing Association, a trade group based in Manhattan. ''The attempt to set public policy is entirely outside their area of expertise.''
During the Amsterdam meeting, Ms. Thomas proposed that Do Not Track signals should actually permit data collection for advertising purposes, the very thing the mechanisms were designed to control. That provocative idea went over with European privacy advocates about as well as a smoker lighting up in a no-smoking zone full of asthmatics.
Indeed, some prominent consumer advocates have interpreted the industry's proposal as an act of bad faith.
''While many advertisers do support privacy, there is clearly a rogue element of advertising networks that wants to subvert the process,'' says Jon D. Leibowitz, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. ''Or so it seems to me.''
Earlier this year at a White House event, the Digital Advertising Alliance, or D.A.A., an industry consortium, pledged to honor don't-track-me signals so long as the systems required consumers to make an affirmative choice. But last Tuesday, the consortium published guidelines saying that it viewed Microsoft's latest browser setting as an automatic, machine-driven choice preselected by a company -- not a choice actively made by an individual consumer. During the installment process, Microsoft's new software actually does give users a choice of whether to keep the mechanism on, or to turn it off. Nevertheless, the consortium said it would not require members to honor the forthcoming browser's don't-track-me signals.
Besides, the D.A.A. has already established its own program for consumers who want to opt out of receiving ads tailored to their online behavior, says Mr. Zaneis, whose own group is a member of that consortium. The consortium remains committed to incorporating browser signals into its program, he says, provided that the systems require consumers to make affirmative choices and give them information on the potential effects of eschewing tailored ads.
''We have self-regulation. It's working very well,'' he says. ''Why don't we give that a chance to succeed?''
SOME government officials vehemently disagree. In a letter to the F.T.C. earlier this month, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, called the industry program an ''ineffective regime'' riddled with exceptions.
''To date, self-regulation for the purposes of consumer privacy protection has failed,'' Mr. Rockefeller wrote.
Now regulators are warning that opposition to Do Not Track could backfire on advertisers, by giving browsers more incentive to empower frustrated users.''We might see a technology arms race with browsers racing to see -- by letting consumers block ads -- who can be the most privacy-protective,'' says Mr. Leibowitz of the F.T.C. ''Maybe that's not a bad thing.''

HEADLINE: Mardie Millit and Michael Garin

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
MARDIE MILLIT does not remember what song Michael Garin was singing that spring night in 2005 when they found themselves at the Birdland jazz club in Midtown Manhattan as part of an open-mic night.
Ms. Millit, a cabaret singer and actress, had already performed, and he was playing piano and crooning one of his own songs. ''It was probably something gross,'' Ms. Millit recalled, alluding to Mr. Garin's sense of humor, which might be described as 12-year-old boy meets smart yet vulnerable man. ''Crude but also sweet. I seriously found him enchanting.''
Ms. Millit leaned over to the woman next to her, a stranger from Saskatchewan, and after comparing Mr. Garin with a horse's backside, added, ''I think I love him a little bit.''
Then she sauntered over to introduce herself. The two quickly found themselves swapping musicians' jokes, squealing with laughter and annoying everyone else sitting nearby. 
At the time, Mr. Garin regularly played piano at the Monkey Bar, and invited Ms. Millit to come by sometime to sing, which she did. ''And there was a chemistry,'' Mr. Garin said. He also found her very pretty. Ten days after they met, she began to ask in jest: ''Don't you think it's been long enough? Don't you think you should be married to me for a little bit now?''
Yet serious obstacles loomed -- most notably their marriages to other people. By then, Ms. Millit said, she was estranged from her husband, who was living in Little Rock, Ark., and Mr. Garin and his wife of nearly three decades were, he said, fighting all the time.
''It was in shambles,'' he said.
The pair began performing together, with their easy repartee part of the act. They said that they kept things more or less professional for a while, though their friendship deepened, helped along by mutual commiseration.
''We found we had this marriage-ending thing in common,'' she said. ''We both needed someone that got it. We found that person in each other.''
Ms. Millit, who is from Shadyside, Ohio, had moved to New York in 1989 seeking Broadway fame, married a theatrical director, moved with him to Missouri, found herself deeply unhappy there and returned to New York, solo, in 2003. She was divorced in 2006.
After meeting Mr. Garin, she tried to date other people, but found that her feelings for him were too strong. ''I could not get him out of my head,'' she said, ''to the point where I was dating this one guy and he kissed me and I burst into tears.''
So she resolved to wait until Mr. Garin was free, though he was torn, wanting at first to stay in his marriage for the sake of his two sons.
They did not pinpoint exactly when their relationship tipped romantic. ''I would've preferred to have been single,'' he said. ''But by the time I fell in love with somebody else, that's the way things were.''
In April 2007, he moved out and embarked on a six-month stint of ''couch surfing,'' dragging his maroon suitcase behind him. ''Not even the kind with wheels,'' Ms. Millit said.
She was in her 11th apartment in five years. Finally, near the end of 2007, they decided to move in together.
''I said the reality is: 'We're in love. I'm not a kid. Let's get together for real,' '' said Mr. Garin, now 58. They were also broke. Six months before the recession officially started, their jobs playing private parties and events dried up. So they moved into a one-bedroom apartment in Harlem in 2008 and found domestic bliss. ''All of a sudden, I could relax completely and utterly,'' he said. ''It was a huge change but if felt like we'd been together forever.''
Not long after, Mr. Garin, who shared Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle awards for the 1991 Off Broadway musical ''Song of Singapore,'' began playing piano at Elaine's every Sunday, and Ms. Millit soon began singing by his side. Elaine Kaufman, the restaurant's owner, watched their tip jar like a hawk, topping it up from the register if it looked too shallow.
It was a heady time for both of them. ''We're small-town guys,'' said Mr. Garin, who is from Greenbelt, Md., ''and I'm at Elaine's playing when in walks Jack Nicholson.''
Someone else walked in one Sunday in 2010 and served Mr. Garin with divorce papers while he was at the piano. He immediately segued into ''Love and Marriage.''
Elaine's closed in May 2011, five months after Ms. Kaufman's death, and ever since the couple have continued to play elsewhere while Mr. Garin works on a new musical.
They decided to marry as soon as his divorce came through. Yet their wedding plans were hampered by their rather dire financial situation, which Mr. Garin described as ''chewing gum and piano wire.''
Then Steven Walter and Josh Gaspero, old friends from Elaine's, stepped in. Both men are owners of the Cutting Room club, which they are planning to reopen on East 32nd Street, and offered Mr. Garin and Ms. Millit a deep discount.
On the day Mr. Garin's divorce was final, the couple set a date. Ms. Millit already had her dress, bought online last year: a diaphanous Art Nouveau gown by Sue Wong that, she said, ''happened to be white, and is not from the bridal industrial complex.'' She also fashioned a headpiece out of a brooch that belonged to Ms. Kaufman.
Mr. Garin had lent his two tuxedos to his sons, ages 19 and 22, who took part in the ceremony. (''What are they called -- best boys?'' he asked Ms. Millit beforehand. ''Gaffers,'' she replied without missing a beat.) So he wore a white double-breasted dinner jacket and black pants with bugle beads. The wedding took place on Oct. 7, as it drizzled in the darkness outside.
The 100 or so guests included a large contingent of singers and musicians and at least two men who wore sunglasses even though it was rather dark in the club.
Ms. Millit, 46, was attended by three friends whom she called ''bride's crones.'' (''Face it, we're not maids,'' she said.)
The ceremony was led by Rabbi Bradley Bleefeld, who could not resist a wisecrack: ''Of all the Jewish ceremonies I dreamed of performing in the Cutting Room, I never thought it would be a wedding.''
Afterward, Mr. Garin took over the microphone, saying, ''I couldn't afford an M.C., but I'd like to welcome Michael and Mardie as we have our first dance.''
The couple swayed to Stevie Wonder's ''Ribbon in the Sky,'' their arms wrapped around each other and eyes locked, as Ms. Millit sang along. Then they broke apart and began pulling their friends and relatives onto the dance floor.
''If not for our friends,'' Mr. Garin said, ''we'd be going to City Hall.''

HEADLINE: Oct. 14 -- 20

 BODY:
IN the 1992 film version of ''GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS'' Jack Lemmon found the pathos of the over-the-hill salesman Shelly Levene in a heartbreaking, almost sentimental performance. In the 2005 Broadway revival, Alan Alda delivered a harder-edged interpretation, making that desperate man more difficult to sympathize with. What Al Pacino will do with the role is one of the more interesting questions of the new revival of this David Mamet classic, which begins preview performances on Friday. He's starring in an excellent cast that includes Bobby Cannavale as Ricky Roma, the part Mr. Pacino played in the movie. 
Mr. Pacino has a reputation as a scenery-chewer, but that stands out less onstage than on screen, and he showed restraint as Shylock in the majestic recent production of ''The Merchant of Venice.'' In an interview before that show opened he offered a clue to his coming performance. On the subject of acting Mr. Mamet's language, Mr. Pacino recalled a lesson from a production of that playwright's ''American Buffalo'': He moved onstage less and less the more he performed. ''Excess was not necessary,'' Mr. Pacino said. ''The economy took over. In those performances, I was exhausted much more, but I moved much less.'' Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, Manhattan; (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com.
BLINK and you'll miss it. AMERICAN BALLET THEATER'S engagement at City Center may be short, but it's packed with ballets worth watching. Along with the return of Mark Morris's ''Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes'' and Twyla Tharp's ''In the Upper Room,'' the highlight is ''Symphony No. 9,'' a premiere by the company's artist in residence -- otherwise known as the savior of ballet -- Alexei Ratmansky. (An interview with Mr. Ratmansky is on Page 7.) The new dance is part of a trilogy of Shostakovich works that will be shown at the Metropolitan Opera House this spring.
Shostakovich was the first composer Mr. Ratmansky discovered on his own, and his music has been a continual source of inspiration. During an interview at the Guggenheim Museum, Mr. Ratmansky called the commission the riskiest project he ever planned, asking, ''How would you sell three symphonies of Shostakovich at the Met?'' With Mr. Ratmansky's choreographic wizardry, it's a snap. Tuesday through Saturday, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan; (212) 581-1212, abt.org; $20-$145.
THE jazz pianist JACKY TERRASSON has a fine touch, a clear conception with roots in Ahmad Jamal and Keith Jarrett, and an old interest in taking apart all kinds of songs to get at their potential for improvisers. He also has a pretty spectacular taste in rhythm sections: if you want to know which young bassists and drummers to follow, see who is working in his new band. His latest trio includes the bassist Burniss Earl Travis, who's been playing with Gretchen Parlato and with Jamire Williams's band Erimaj; and the drummer Justin Faulkner, who's been part of Branford Marsalis's quartet since he was 18, which was three years ago. Mr. Terrasson has a new album, ''Gouache,'' released by Universal in France. This is the first chance to hear some of that material, which might include Erik Satie's ''Je Te Veux,'' Justin Bieber's ''Baby'' and Sonny Rollins's ''Valse Hot.'' Sets at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. Thursday-Sunday, with an 11:30 p.m. set Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan; (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $25-$30.
ANY parent whose child is found to have a rare, debilitating medical condition embarks on a quest to learn as much as possible about it. But Dorey and Yolanda Nez's journey was particularly profound, serving not just as a lesson in genetics but also as a case study in how the broad events of history can have very personal consequences, even many generations later.
The Nez family's story is told in ''SUN KISSED,'' an installment of PBS's ''POV'' series that has its premiere on Thursday night. (Check local listings.) The couple, who are Navajo, had two children with a severe form of xeroderma pigmentosum, or X.P., a genetic disorder, and then met other Navajo parents whose children had it as well. In the course of the documentary they learn that the relatively high prevalence of X.P. among Navajo children appears to stem from the Long Walk of 1864, a 450-mile forced relocation of the Navajo by the Army that killed many and restricted the tribe's gene pool. The film, by Maya Stark and Adi Lavy, is built from an unusual mix of history, science and traditional Navajo culture, and its emotional climax pulls no punches.
WHAT happens when you drop hothouse flowers from Andy Warhol's Factory into sleepy, conservative San Diego? A surf movie, of course, though one with almost no surfing. (Only one Factory member, Tom Hompertz of ''Lonesome Cowboys,'' could actually surf.) Shot by Warhol and Paul Morrissey in 1968, ''SAN DIEGO SURF'' was only partly edited before being tucked away in the archives. Completed by Mr. Morrissey, it will have its premiere in the Museum of Modern Art's ''To Save and Project'' festival.
Part home movie, part slightly demented comedy of manners, this improvisatory film has a loose-to-nonexistent plot involving Viva (a scene stealer) and Taylor Mead as a divorcing couple with social aspirations: they want to leave behind the second-class world of golfers to join the wonderful world of surfers. Mostly the movie listens in as people talk in that Warhol-Morrissey way: the banal seems hilariously subversive and the outré disarmingly frank, as in the ending here, a climactic burst of comic homoeroticism, featuring Mr. Mead, who will introduce the film at MoMA. (Tuesday at 7 p.m. at the Museum of Modern Art; moma.org, 212-708-9400.)
EVERY portrait by Édouard Manet is, in some way, a comment on Parisian modernity. Perhaps that's why it's rare to see his portraits isolated from his other works, as they are in ''MANET: PORTRAYING LIFE'' at the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio. Toledo is the only United States stop for the exhibition, which was organized with the Royal Academy of Arts in London and will appear there in 2013. The 40 paintings on view include ''Émile Zola'' from the Musée d'Orsay, ''Le Repos (Portrait of Berthe Morisot)'' from the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, and the Toledo Museum's own ''Portrait of M. Antonin Proust'' (a childhood friend of the artist, not to be confused with Marcel Proust).
But not everything here sits as squarely in the portrait category: in ''The Railway,'' for instance, a little girl peers out at the Gare St.-Lazare through the bars of a tall iron fence. She is thought to be the daughter of Manet's neighbor; the woman with her is Victorine Meurent, who modeled for ''Olympia'' and ''Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe.'' And Manet seems less interested in them as individuals than as the eyes and ears of a changing city. Through Jan. 1; (419) 255-8000, toledomuseum.org.
LIFE is not complete without hearing a Handel tune -- played by a ukulele -- accompanying sequential, then simultaneous, renditions of ''Fly Me to the Moon,'' ''Love Story (Where Do I Begin),'' ''Killing Me Softly With His Song,'' ''Hotel California'' and ''I Will Survive.'' It is not complete without listening to an ensemble -- of ukuleles -- strumming the funky theme from ''Shaft'' as a man looking like an assistant bank manager in provincial Britain pronounces the lyric ''Who's the black private dick who's a hit with all the chicks?'' It is not complete without experiencing the desolate up-and-down whistled theme from ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' accompanied by a band -- of ukuleles.
For the uninitiated, we're talking about the UKULELE ORCHESTRA OF GREAT BRITAIN, which is not really an orchestra but eight people in formal wear playing different-size versions of the humble four-stringed instrument. For the rest, you know what we're talking about: performances full of wit, musical polish and sheer loopiness. After selling out Carnegie's Zankel Hall in 2010 (their YouTube hits number in the millions), the Ukulele Orchestra has been given an upgrade and will perform in Carnegie's main auditorium at 8 p.m. on Wednesday. Ticket holders are invited to bring their ukuleles to join along on one piece, but first see the score on Carnegie's Web site. (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $12.50-$60.

HEADLINE: The Chile Capital of the World

BYLINE: By ABE STREEP

 BODY:
Some of the best chile peppers in the world are grown in Hatch, N.M., about four hours south of Santa Fe, which bills itself as the Chile Capital of the World, though Socorro, further north, has been making inroads. I've lived in Santa Fe for five years, and I know of no other town with a tourism- and restaurant-driven economy that relies so heavily on one ingredient. In the fall, the whole town smells of the rich smoke of fresh green chiles being broiled in rotisserie-style roasters: Big Jim, a fat pepper that's perfect for chiles rellenos; sandias, hotter and smaller, good for stews; Joe E. Parkers, which fall along the milder end of the spice spectrum. 
Some people swear by the nuclear stuff at the Horseman's Haven, a diner adjacent to a gas station that serves chile in two different spice levels. (Despite a warning, I recently tried a thimbleful of the Level 2 on my breakfast burrito and left the restaurant in tears.) Others prefer La Choza, a funky New Mexican restaurant, or the Red Enchilada, a truly good hole in the wall. But most real chile addicts buy it in bulk from the vendors on Cerrillos Road, a four-lane artery lined with carwashes and big-box stores.
That's where I went recently to stock up before moving to New York. I stopped at Fred's Socorro Chile, which sells about 1,000 bushels a week during harvest season and helps supply some of Santa Fe's top restaurants. I bought a half-bushel of Socorro Big Jim chiles the size of flashlights for $25. In another parking lot, I found a guy selling Hatch chiles, which are smaller and spicier. There was a connoisseur behind me in line, an immense man in an Iron Maiden T-shirt. ''Did you ask to taste them before buying?'' I hadn't. ''I always ask to taste them. Did you see the veins?'' I hadn't. ''I look for the yellow veins. That's when they get really hot. I like them hot.''
The vendor finished roasting my chiles and handed me the burlap sack. I offered the connoisseur a taste. He seemed satisfied, and so did I, because the other thing about freshly roasted chile is that the scent lingers, especially in cars. It was comforting to know that when I drove to New York a week later, I'd be smelling New Mexico all the way there.

HEADLINE: Desperately Seeking Supper

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL RICH, TOM RACHMAN, DAVID SAX, DAMIEN CAVE, ELISABETH ROSENTHAL, ABE STREEP, JOHN WILLOUGHBY, MARIO BATALI, PETER MEEHAN, ALICE FEIRING, WILLIAM NEUMAN and JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

 BODY:
In Search of the TonguegasmBy Nathaniel Rich
The first stage of Sichuan addiction -- experimentation -- is brief and violent. You either get out immediately, vanquished and penitent, or something inside you changes. Inside your stomach and inside your brain, the surge of dopamine alters the neurochemistry, requiring the addict to seek to match that first, miraculous high. My initiation occurred in 1997 at Wu Liang Ye, one of Manhattan's first Sichuan restaurants, which, the manager told me, was opened by the People's Republic of China to promote awareness of the variety and complexity of Chinese cuisine. 
This act of culinary propaganda was enormously successful -- Sichuan restaurants soon began appearing all over New York. I later followed the Sichuan trail to restaurants in Sunset Park, Bensonhurst and the subterranean food courts in Flushing, which require a Chinese-speaking guide to navigate properly. It was a pastime, I told myself, all in good fun. Then I read about the San Gabriel Valley, east of Los Angeles, which has the most-concentrated Chinese community in the U.S. and a staggering array of Sichuan restaurants. The most prominent of these -- the Sichuan king of San Gabriel -- is Chung King. The next time I was in L.A., I drove straight to San Gabriel Boulevard. That's when I lost control. I don't know if Chung King is the best Sichuan restaurant in America, but I can attest that it induces delirium.
A clarification: Sichuan food should not be confused with what most Americans understand to be Chinese food. It is distinguished by spicy, oil-based sauces that are flavored by salt, garlic, ginger, pickled chilies, doubanjiang -- a spicy paste made from broad beans -- and, most crucially, Sichuan peppercorns, which burst like Bang Snaps on your tongue and give the food its trademark flavor: ma la (''numbing spicy''). When your mouth is coated with ma la, water tastes like flat ginger ale. One Sichuan devotee I know describes the ma la sensation as a ''tonguegasm.'' The pulse increases and the pupils dilate, often accompanied by a postnasal drip. The brain floats in a euphoric ether.
Sichuan menus tend to list approximately 800 dishes, and at many lesser restaurants each comes drowned in a numbing, spicy oil. But Sichuan cuisine has, in fact, 22 other flavors besides ma la. This I learned from Fuchsia Dunlop's definitive Sichuan cookbook, ''Land of Plenty,'' in which she describes each of these flavors, including ''red-oil flavor,'' ''fragrant wine flavor'' and, my favorite, ''strange-flavor,'' which combines ma la with han (salty), tian (sweet), suan (sour), xian (fresh-savory) and xiang (fragrant) notes.
On my return to Chung King this summer, I determined to try as many of the 23 flavors as possible. I began with Chung King-flavored noodles; these were numbing and spicy, to be certain, but also had a note of ''scorched-chili flavor,'' which is derived from mixing fried, dried chili with soy sauce, Sichuan pepper, vinegar, garlic and sugar. A dry, cumin-dusted lamb rubbed with large chunks of garlic and chili peppers delivered the dense ''smoked flavor.'' Spicy eggplant, a Sichuan staple, tasted as if it had been fermented in vinegar, a blending of the ''homestyle'' and ''fish-fragrant'' flavors. Most magnificent, however, were the boiled fish slices, garnished with fresh cilantro, in a bowl of hot sauce, in which could be perceived not just the Sichuan peppercorn but also star anise -- a trademark of the elite ''five-spice flavor.'' The fried chicken with garlic and crunchy red chili peppers might have been imbued with the sublime ''strange-flavor,'' but by that point my mouth was numb.
I always make a point of ordering some dish unsettling to the Western sensibility in the assumption that it must be authentic and therefore marvelous. At Chung King, the best way to do this is to walk to the back of the restaurant, where there stands a kind of deli counter arrayed with a number of cold dishes that the restaurant does not include on the English menu. I pointed at a platter that seemed to contain thin slabs of red marble. I was told that these were sliced pig ears. They were salty and greasy (''Sichuan pepper flavor,'' from raw Sichuan pepper mashed with green scallions, salt and sesame oil). I ate them all.
What I'm Into: Al MichaelsAs told to Spencer Bailey
''I don't eat any vegetables. None. I have never eaten vegetables. As I grew older, I just would not even look at them. If I died right now, I might be the human being who lived the longest without ever eating a vegetable.''
Don't Guzzle the ArtBy Tom Rachman
In a lab of spinning flasks and mysterious potions, the amateur chemists toil away with base materials like gin, equipment like a centrifuge and the highly unscientific objective of concocting the most sensual cocktails known to man. ''It's not just about liquid in a glass. It's how you smell that liquid, how you see that liquid, how you taste that liquid, what that liquid does once it's in your mouth,'' Tony Conigliaro said. We were conversing amid the whirring machinery of the Drink Factory, his laboratory in Pink Floyd's former London recording studios, crammed with hundreds of peculiar cocktail ingredients, from nettles and Sichuan pepper to Transylvanian bee pollen. ''For us, it's about the complete journey from the minute you walk in the bar to everything else, all the way up to the drink.''
Conigliaro, 41, is shy and retiring for a barman, but he is nevertheless an inspirational figure on the drinks scene of London. After experimenting with advanced culinary techniques in the late '90s, he was introduced to the work of Ferran Adrià, the Spanish icon of molecular gastronomy, and that inspired a kind of molecular mixology. Some of his creations are wild (a cosmopolitan that he shatters into ''popcorn'' with liquid nitrogen); others might be considered just plain strange (a vodka drink inspired by soil, flavored with clay, flint and moss); others reconfigure classics (a rhubarb gimlet or an apple-and-hay Bellini). Several are concept drinks, like the Rose, which was intended to evoke a stroll through an English garden with a glass of Champagne; or Les Fleurs du Mal, a rose vodka-and-absinthe tribute, he says, to Baudelaire.
I conducted a few experiments on myself, involving nine cocktails, with the help of a lab assistant (drinking partner) whom I took on undercover visits to both of Conigliaro's London bars. At 69 Colebrooke Row  -- a tiny place with a '50s hepcat theme  -- the standouts included a Barbershop Fizz (pine-infused gin, birch and vanilla syrup, patchouli-infused mint, lime juice, topped with soda water), which possessed that classic cocktail characteristic of seeming utterly refreshing while having the opposite effect. The aromatic Honeysuckle (liqueur flavored with pollen, honey and honeysuckle, topped with Champagne), meanwhile, was like putting your nose over a honey pot that fizzes. His second bar, the Zetter Townhouse, has a loosely Georgian theme and includes a cocktail conjuring 18th-century naval history: the Master at Arms (dark rum, port reduction and homemade grenadine), a delicious dessert of a drink.
Looking around, though, my companion and I realized we were the only ones analyzing each mouthful. Other customers were not thinking about the liquid in the glass -- the smell, the sight, the taste. They were throwing back drinks. Which is why the cocktail bar -- even the fantastically inventive kind -- is unlikely to reach the heights of a top restaurant. Part of its appeal is also its fatal weakness: the more you taste, the less well you taste.The Best Matzo Ball on EarthBy David Sax
Matzo balls are an emotional and nostalgic minefield, and arguing over their virtues is a pointless blood sport among Jews. If you are foolish enough to complain about a matzo ball that's served to you, you're essentially spitting in the face of the cook, their mother, their bubby and several centuries of that family's matriarchs. When asked, the only appropriate response to a question of matzo ball quality is: ''My mother's are the best in the world.''
At least that's what I believed until I entered Fülemüle, a small restaurant in Budapest, which serves Hungarian-style Jewish dishes including a goose-matzo-ball soup. Once a staple of the Eastern European Jewish diet, goose is now largely forgotten by North American Jews, whose love of chicken has launched a thousand kosher caterers. András Singer, Fülemüle's chef and owner, who died in July, took me into the kitchen, where a pot simmered with chunks of goose back and wing meat, carrots, garlic, brussels sprouts, mushrooms and other spices for the broth. He took out a metal mixing bowl and crushed five whole matzos, explaining that the imperfect texture was better than the uniform mush from preground matzo meal. He added eggs, ginger and parsley, salt and pepper, and a few healthy tablespoons of melted goose fat, mixed it all around and rolled them into squash balls, which he dropped into boiling salted water.
When the matzo balls were cooked, Singer placed them in a bowl with chunks of dark pulled goose meat, the vegetables and a few ladles of amber broth. I took my first bite and knew right then that I was eating the greatest matzo ball on earth. The irregularity of the ball's shape made chewing a mental game -- the equivalent of eating a country sourdough after decades of Wonder Bread -- and the ginger gave enough kick to cut through the schmaltz. How would I break the news to my mother?
Recipe: The Best Matzo Balls in the World (Besides Your Mom's)What I'm Into: Gayle KingAs told to Spencer Bailey
''Krispy Kreme is really like heroin to me. I've literally gone to Krispy Kreme when it's first out of the oven, bought a dozen to share and eaten eight of them before my destination, which was three blocks away. That's not an exaggeration.''War RationsBy Damien Cave
There are a few basic rules that define food in wartime: Eat what you can, when you can; share; appreciate what you have. That's as true for Marines in Iraq as it is for the Issa family, whom I met in the tiny Lebanese village Rama, just over the Syrian border, one month after they fled Syria's grinding conflict.
It was Ramadan, and the usual menu for the sunset meal that breaks the daily fast had been winnowed to a handful of dishes. The kitchen of the Issas' borrowed concrete home lacked an oven -- they used a borrowed hot plate -- and the electricity cut in and out. ''It's as if we went back to the Stone Age,'' Maha Issa said, wiping sweat from her brow after describing the sweets she would have made at home. ''We are restricting ourselves to only what is necessary.''
Three families, with a total of 21 people, had moved into the house, and every meal was a team effort. Maha knelt on the floor in a long dress, rapidly spooning spiced meat into pillows of doughy dumplings that were stewed in yogurt for a dish called shishbarak. Her sister-in-law oversaw the burners, while their daughters, in skinny jeans and headscarves, cut vegetables. At the edge stood Mohammed, Maha's husband, a real estate agent in their hometown, Homs. ''My parents are still there,'' Maha said. ''They get shelled every day. And my son. He's 21.'' She used a small teacup to cut out dough circles for the dumplings. ''I want to go home.''
''Why would you say that?'' her husband asked. ''Because I do!'' she said. Mohammed shook his head but smiled. It was her kitchen.
Minutes later, dishes flowed out two at a time: rice and chicken sautéed in tomatoes and onions, tabbouleh, French fries, fried dumplings, dumplings stewed in yogurt, large round discs of kibbe, ground lamb cut into diamonds. There were dates, there was bread and there was Pepsi. Finally Maha signaled it was time to sit down.
Then, as if on cue, there was an explosion. None of the Issas reacted. The clink of forks on plates and the rustle of bread in plastic bags were the only sounds. Mohammed joked that he would have returned his wife to her family if she hadn't been such a good cook. The children turned on a small television; the women cleared the plates. Fruit and tea followed. Then Mohammed's phone rang, and he jumped up to the window hoping for better reception. All eyes and ears tuned in. It was his cousin in Syria. The war was back.What to Eat on the Frozen TundraBy Elisabeth Rosenthal
You don't want to be squeamish, and you especially don't want to be vegan, if you visit Greenland. Greenland is so far north that little grows there, and its haute cuisine is centered on the animals that you probably have never eaten before -- ones that can survive in its frigid seas and on its ice-covered land. They include, but are not limited to, whale, seal, musk ox, polar bear and reindeer, something of a national delicacy.
Thinly sliced into steaks, reindeer is an extremely lean and tender meat that is at once delicate, slightly sweet and gamy -- a combination I'd never previously encountered. It was the only dish I ordered more than once during my six days in the country. At the opposite end of the spectrum was polar bear, which I sampled when invited to a traditional Inuit wedding. It was hard to chew and harder to swallow -- stringy, fatty and coarsely meaty. Nothing, absolutely nothing, tasted like chicken.The Chile Capital of the WorldBy Abe Streep
Some of the best chile peppers in the world are grown in Hatch, N.M., about four hours south of Santa Fe, which bills itself as the Chile Capital of the World, though Socorro, further north, has been making inroads. I've lived in Santa Fe for five years, and I know of no other town with a tourism- and restaurant-driven economy that relies so heavily on one ingredient. In the fall, the whole town smells of the rich smoke of fresh green chiles being broiled in rotisserie-style roasters: Big Jim, a fat pepper that's perfect for chiles rellenos; sandias, hotter and smaller, good for stews; Joe E. Parkers, which fall along the milder end of the spice spectrum.
Some people swear by the nuclear stuff at the Horseman's Haven, a diner adjacent to a gas station that serves chile in two different spice levels. (Despite a warning, I recently tried a thimbleful of the Level 2 on my breakfast burrito and left the restaurant in tears.) Others prefer La Choza, a funky New Mexican restaurant, or the Red Enchilada, a truly good hole in the wall. But most real chile addicts buy it in bulk from the vendors on Cerrillos Road, a four-lane artery lined with carwashes and big-box stores.
That's where I went recently to stock up before moving to New York. I stopped at Fred's Socorro Chile, which sells about 1,000 bushels a week during harvest season and helps supply some of Santa Fe's top restaurants. I bought a half-bushel of Socorro Big Jim chiles the size of flashlights for $25. In another parking lot, I found a guy selling Hatch chiles, which are smaller and spicier. There was a connoisseur behind me in line, an immense man in an Iron Maiden T-shirt. ''Did you ask to taste them before buying?'' I hadn't. ''I always ask to taste them. Did you see the veins?'' I hadn't. ''I look for the yellow veins. That's when they get really hot. I like them hot.''
The vendor finished roasting my chiles and handed me the burlap sack. I offered the connoisseur a taste. He seemed satisfied, and so did I, because the other thing about freshly roasted chile is that the scent lingers, especially in cars. It was comforting to know that when I drove to New York a week later, I'd be smelling New Mexico all the way there.The Great Pasty DebateBy John Willoughby
From the mid-1960s until my mother died in 2003, I visited Copper Harbor, a little town at the tip of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, nearly every summer. If you've been to this part of the country, you know pasties -- a sort of beef stew in a pastry shell that originated in Cornwall and came to the area with Cornish miners in the late 1800s. Back then the Upper Peninsula was the site of a copper boom. By 1900, Calumet, the nearest city to Copper Harbor, had a 16,000-volume library and an elaborate opera house where Sarah Bernhardt performed, and eight foreign-language newspapers. But the copper ran out and the Depression came, and today Calumet is a village of some 700 people in a region of ghost towns and abandoned mines.
As is so often the case, food is the last tradition left from those glory days, and I returned to Copper Harbor this summer in search of pasties (properly pronounced with a soft ''a''). The dish inspires a fair amount of passion there, and I heard the first pasty argument as I walked out of the airport. Potatoes and onions are a given, but carrots are controversial, and a particularly fierce squabble concerns turnips versus rutabagas. There's also the question of whose are best this year. (A current favorite is found on Fridays at the Mohawk Superette.) After sampling at least a dozen versions -- some with thick, soggy pastry, others with gnarly meat, yet others drenched with (apostasy!) gravy -- I'm partial to those from Toni's Country Kitchen in Laurium, Calumet's sister village.
Eric Frimodig, the folksy, genial guy who has owned and run the place since 1982, is a third-generation pasty expert. He eschews carrots and comes down firmly on the side of rutabagas because, ''they're sweeter than turnips, and they've got that nice orangy color so everything isn't white and brown.'' When you fork through it, a bit of steam comes drifting out, bringing with it the rich aroma of root vegetables and meat and onion, a smellthat tugs at the taste memory of anyone raised on hearty European-derived food. It instantly brings you back to real copper country.
Recipe: Copper Country PastiesThe UnmentionablesBy Mario Batali
The last time I was in Tokyo, I took an early-evening constitutional to the mythic Yakitori Alley, tucked under train tracks near Yurakucho Station and spilling out onto the street. It was everything I dreamed of: lopsided makeshift stalls, low tables with backless stools, dudes in suits and, of course, smoky grills operated by very focused chefs. The menus were long and filled with all kinds of delicacies -- everything from pork tongue to more-challenging items like pork uterus.
I went to a disheveled stand with five or six people waiting, assuming it was the best. The menu was almost all pork, chicken and vegetables, but the chicken was divided into very, very specific subcategories. There were recognizable items like skin, gizzards, wings and thighs, but also unique items like inner thighs, breast plate and cartilage.
I love every part of the chicken: the pope's nose, the oysters hidden along the center of the back bone, the liver, the heart, the gizzards and the odd pieces on the underside of the rib cage. My favorite of all, though, is the pristine cartilage attached to the lower-leg-thigh connection -- basically, the kneecaps. Discovering a place that serves a chicken kneecap is exciting. Discovering a place that serves a bunch of them -- carefully lined along a wooden skewer, grilled over hardwood charcoal and basted with a slightly sweet-and-sour miso glaze -- is heavenly.
The kneecap skewer was crunchy and firm, peppery from the sansho I dusted on it, and yet succulent beneath the light char. As I chewed through the cartilage, the crunch was barely audible. I got two more, burying one in sansho and finishing the other one with yuzu. On the walk home, I floated with the plum leaves in the smoke above the station.
Bruce Ratner: What I'm IntoAs told to Spencer Bailey''I've never met a chicken I didn't like. Whether it's Kentucky fried or whether it's barbecued or it's wings or it's sautéed, that's my food. And I'm not particular about where I eat it. No. 1 would be Kentucky Fried Chicken. That's not politically correct, but I would say that's the best chicken. General Tso's chicken -- that's good, too. Chin Chin restaurant in Manhattan -- that's good chicken.''Ital is VitalBy Peter Meehan
I was driving through the damp sweater of Jamaica's summer heat with Roy Johnson, a k a Congo Ashanti, a founder of the Congos, whose 1977 album, ''The Heart of the Congos,'' is one of the finest vocal reggae albums ever cut. I was in Roy's car for two reasons. First, the Congos made one of my favorite records of the year, the trancelike ''Icon Give Thank.'' And second, because while watching ''Icon Eye,'' the documentary about the making of the album, there were several scenes starring Ital food, the predominantly vegetarian diet of the Rastafarian faith. One day, the Congos' recording session was fueled by a shake made of cooked pumpkin, peanuts and oats and spiked with nutmeg. Another scene focused on Winston Jones, a k a Drummerman, who runs an Ital food shop in Portmore, near the Congos' studio. I had to go there.
A chief goal of the Ital diet is to enhance vitality -- the root of its name. ''The food we eat give us strength to sing the music that we sing,'' Roy told me. Dairy, alcohol and meat are out; fish is permissible, and salt is eschewed by many. The diet is, in part, a rejection of what the Rastafari call the Babylon system, a way of life seen as oppressive and contrary to healthful living. In a supermarket, this takes the form of junk food, artificial seasonings and products of industrialized agriculture.
I ate nearly all of my Ital meals at Drummerman's food shop, which is really a shack in the corner of his yard. Breakfasts were plastic bowls of neutral-colored sludgy porridge served piping hot even on scorching Jamaican mornings. A blend of raw peanuts and oats (or sometimes bulgur, with the chance addition of puréed banana), and sweetened with a strong dose of brown sugar, it was flavorful and sustaining.
Lunch and dinner included vegetable staples of the Ital repertory: a dark stew of ''veggie chunks'' (textured vegetable protein) seasoned with allspice; a tangle of complexly flavored cooked-down callaloo greens; a quick sauté of shredded white cabbage, scented with garlic, tossed with a garden mix of corn, lima beans, pumpkin shreds and more. A starch, like rice and peas, held down the rest of the serving. I also had a too-big helping of whole-wheat dumplings, little plugs of pan-cooked whole-wheat dough, which were moist and dense and perfect for sopping up with.
One night Drummerman had snapper on offer. Served room temperature, it was crisp and golden brown on the outside, the flesh still moist. He served it with bammy, a slab of pan-fried flatbread, which I thought was depressingly monochromatic until I ate a bite, and then another.
Juices, a steady component of the Ital diet, were also excellent. Tart plum juice, tamed with sugar and ginger and a touch of lime, was my favorite. ''Average people in Jamaica don't eat from Rasta, don't drink from Rasta,'' Roy told me one languorous afternoon. ''And we don't rush them. But they don't know what they're missing.''

Wine of (Seriously) AncientsBy Alice Feiring
For hard-core wine purists, a pilgrimage must be made to eastern Georgia, where they still use a 5,000-year-old technology called qvevri. There, wine is aged in huge, beeswax-lined, turret-shaped clay pots that are buried in soil. In this deeply religious country, winemakers are obsessed with purity. Sulfur is still associated with the devil, and many shun it and other additives.
I was compelled to take the trip after a few stateside glasses of juicy, rusty-hued kisi and the honey-scented mtsvane (both whites) and spicy saperavi (a red). After a bumpy Aerosvit flight, I arrived ragged to a crumbling, yet beautiful, wine-obsessed country at the precipice of viticultural modernization. There are already some large wineries using stainless steel tanks and making chardonnay, but I visited a number of others -- including Alaverdi Monastery and Pheasant's Tears -- who still do it the old-fashioned way. At one vineyard, I met a winemaker named Iago Bitarishvili. It soon became clear that he was the master of chinuri. He stomps the grapes, fills the pots, seals the wine for fermentation and bottles it when stable. Only after drinking his chinuri's lemony richness was I revived.Eating Like a CavemanBy William Neuman
A little before 10 a.m., we crossed the Capanaparo River and pulled into a speck of a town called La Macanilla, deep in the plains of western Venezuela. The man in the front passenger seat of our S.U.V. was named Lolo, and he'd been telling us he was hungry for more than an hour. Lolo, who loves to eat and loves to talk, ran for mayor in this impoverished corner of Venezuela. Sometimes when he greeted voters, as in La Macanilla, he hiked up his orange shirt to show his bare belly, round and smooth as a brass Buddha's. It was a kind of campaign ad: I eat well; vote for me, and you can too.
Lolo raises, buys and sells cattle, which is what was on the menu that morning -- barbecue for breakfast. The way they do it here is called carne en vara, which means beef on a stick. It is primitive, elemental and delicious. We stopped at a nameless restaurant next to the road that consisted of a tin roof with no walls, a few plain wooden tables and chairs. In one corner was a steel box without a top, about two and a half feet high. A few logs were burning inside. Large hunks of bright red beef, cut from the carcass of a cow that was raised a few miles away and probably killed yesterday, were cooking on skewers over the coals. Parts were charred. Parts were bloody. It was caveman food.
The way carne en vara works is you tell the cook how much you want, by weight. The first time I ate carne en vara (for dinner), I was in the company of a more penurious friend who liked to order by the half kilo or quarter kilo. That wasn't Lolo's style. He started with a kilo or a kilo and a half and went up from there. The cook pulled the stick off the fire and sliced a chunk of meat into a tin pan, which he put onto a hanging scale. Then he cut it into bite-size chunks and dumped them on a plate. The plate was plopped onto the center of the table, and a tray of crackerlike cassava bread was set out. No cutlery. Just gorging.
I've pulled many steaks, charred outside, bloody inside, off the grill back home in Brooklyn, but it was never like this. Maybe it's eating with your hands. Maybe it's the wild sweep of the plains all around. The first time I ate carne en vara I was covered in grease. But I noticed that no one else seemed to be piling up the paper napkins. The next time I watched my tablemates and I saw that for all its primitive excess, there's a delicacy about eating carne en vara. You use your fingertips to pick through the bloody and charred pieces until you find the one that speaks to you. Then you pop it into your mouth and start the hunt for the next one.The Naan ChallengeBy Jeffrey Gettleman
I was on a quest for the perfect buttered naan, the chewiest, flakiest, butteryest, most succulent piece of fire-roasted flatbread. Though often relegated to the world of side dishes, an ancillary part of any Indian feast, baked in a Tandoori oven, sometimes with garlic, sometimes with butter, sometimes plain, it is, for me, always inspiring. And so my quest landed me in Diamond Plaza in the heart of Nairobi's old Indian community, which sprouted roots here more than a century ago, dragged to Africa by the British to build a railroad. A lot of those Indian railroad workers were eaten by lions, and the railroad ended up being called the Lunatic Express, but I digress.
Diamond Plaza is a mall with a somewhat shabby but otherwise legendary food court that is not for the faint at heart. The moment you arrive and sit on the worn picnic-style benches, you are immediately swarmed by a gang of waiters, each man's crisply ironed shirt representing his organization: Bismillah BBQ -- Where Quality Matters, Happy Chunkie's Kitchen, Anilz, Chick Corner, American Delights: House of Chapati, Fresh 'n' Healthy (a juice bar) and so on and so on. The waiters push and shove and giggle and jostle, eager for you to order from them.
I presided over a quick congress. Who had the best buttered naan? Of course there was no agreement, so I ordered three different naans from three different places. Bombay Chowpatty's arrived first. Two bites in I realized that it was good, really good, actually, chewy and deliciously greasy. Then came its cousin, a naan from a similarly named restaurant, Chowpaty. It was a little doughier, maybe plucked from the tandoori oven a minute prematurely. Of course, any fresh naan is good naan, and don't let anyone lead you to think otherwise.
But then came Anilz's. It was the pièce de résistance, the answer to my prayers. It was left intact, not cut into triangles and unceremoniously stuffed into little plastic baskets like the others. This beaut was a foot-long piece of steaming hot bread, proudly stretched out on a real ceramic plate, in all of its glory, both soft and chewy and charred and crunchy in spots, a few delicious pools of melted butter tucked into the hills and valleys of its bready landscape. There were forks wrapped in paper napkins, but who needed those? This was a fingertip job, and it went cruelly quickly.
Three minutes later Anilz's offering had vanished into my guts. I looked up to issue my pronouncement and to share this momentous occasion with the waiters. The winner is. . . . But they were busy swarming other tables, teetering over new customers, giggling and jostling and flapping their laminated menus.
Wendy Williams: What I'm IntoAs told to Spencer Bailey''I carry my own Frank's Red Hot sauce because there are a lot of places where everything is good, and when it comes to the sauces, they pull out Tabasco sauce. I'm like, 'Are you kidding me?' Frequently, Frank's is the one thing I'll have in my bag.''

HEADLINE: Disagree to Agree

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
Christina Beckwith was a public high-school Spanish teacher in Michigan when she was laid off because of government spending cuts. She says she wants to vote for whichever candidate will fix the economy, but she isn't sure who that is. ''I don't have any training to be able to figure all of that out,'' she told me.
It's something I heard a lot recently. Pew Research Center, the polling company, put me in touch with a group of voters who were on the fence about the candidates and were willing to have a journalist contact them as the election neared. These swing voters represented many demographics, from various corners of the country. I spoke to a young soldier in Texas, a grandmother in Minnesota, and a 69-year-old teacher's assistant in Mississippi, among others. Some of them had confusing views. One Tea Party supporter wanted to raise taxes on the rich and strengthen entitlements, like Medicare and Social Security. The teacher's assistant, who said she was voting for Romney, echoed these traditionally Democratic sentiments. She had never been able to figure out where either party stood on these issues, she told me. 
We've heard for months that this election is about the economy, and polls show it's by far the issue that people care most about. We've also heard pundits complain that the election will come down to the vicissitudes of undecideds who don't understand these issues. Yet as I spoke to a sampling of voters, it became clear that while, it's true, they knew little about economic policy, most agreed on basic economic questions. And while some leaned Democrat and others Republican, the questions they had and the beliefs they held represented a broad center of American opinion.
In a series of polls going back decades, the Pew Research Center and other surveyors have shown that America is divided on many economic issues in name only. A majority of Americans support Social Security and Medicare, a progressive tax system and a government that regulates business in the public interest, but most share deep skepticism about the government's ability to do all this well. Compared with much of U.S. history and to many countries around the world today, America has already settled its most significant economic debates. From the 1780s to the 1930s, there were a series of profound economic questions that fueled deep discord. Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton fought over the basic nature of the new U.S. economy (agrarian or industrial?) and who would control the nation's currency (a central bank or the nation's private banks?). Hamilton won the first battle and the second one wasn't resolved until the creation of the Fed in 1913.
In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, the debates covered basics like whether the federal government could even regulate business or tax citizens at all. Then the 1930s brought all sorts of fundamental changes, including the development of Social Security, modern financial regulation and a government-managed housing industry.
Crudely speaking, Franklin D. Roosevelt shifted the nation to the left during the '30s, and the nation has spent the last four decades moving slightly right. We are now in the process of fine-tuning. This becomes particularly apparent when comparing the United States with other industrialized nations. The United States is the rare state without a socialist or communist political party that wins significant votes. Europeans often have national debates about fundamental economic issues: how much industry should be government-controlled; what does private enterprise owe the state; what is the relationship between the European Union's economic authorities and its member states. These debates are mild compared with the ones raging in China, India, Brazil and other rapidly industrializing nations.
Perhaps the best example of this economic consensus are the two candidates for the presidency. For someone who lived in the first 150 years or so of this country, it might be hard to see what's so different about the economic policies of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. Romney seeks a 25 percent top corporate tax rate, and Obama is proposing 28 percent. Romney wants to eliminate capital-gains taxes for the typical investor and leave the rate at 15 percent for higher earners. Obama wants to increase it to 20 percent. They differ on how to tax the highest incomes. But for most Americans, the distinctions might be mistaken for a rounding error. Both men strongly support expanding free trade and maintaining close to the same level of Social Security and welfare benefits. Neither has any specific plan to radically change the way we regulate business, the environment or the workplace.
These platforms can be partly explained by the fact that, even among partisan voters, there is still a lot of consensus. According to Pew, 40 percent of Republicans say that the government should help those who can't help themselves; 21 percent of Democrats say the government should not. The biggest divide over economic policy concerns environmental regulations. Ninety-three percent of Democrats want stricter environmental laws, while only 47 percent of Republicans do. So even the most partisan Americans, on the most partisan topic, agree with one another nearly half the time. I was unable to find anybody who had strong opinions on issues like how best to regulate Wall Street.
Yet the two sides play down the overlaps. Jonathan Collegio, the communications director for the pro-Romney super PAC American Crossroads, said there was often far more agreement than discord between the candidates' views, and policy disagreements were not usually salient to the average voter. ''At the end of the day, a family of four isn't at home talking about what the corporate tax rate should be,'' he said. But no campaign would win, he told me, by painting a challenger as a slightly different version of the incumbent. ''If you were selling a new cola, and you told people it tasted like Coca-Cola, nobody would buy it,'' he said.
As nasty as the campaign has been, Romney has struggled to convince voters that he's all that different from the current Coca-Cola. That's largely because Obama has avoided the potentially divisive issues, like more stimulus and a broader overhaul of financial-market regulation, that many economists urged during his term. The Romney campaign has had trouble deciding whether this election should be positioned as one of historic decisions -- capitalism versus socialism -- or if it's better to ask the smaller question of who can better manage an economic recovery in an age of broad consensus.
As Romney's campaign surely knows, the last two challengers to unseat incumbents also based their campaigns on the economy. In 1980, Ronald Reagan was able to portray the election as one of stark differences in a time of true change. The economic crisis of the late 1970s brought the collapse of the post-F.D.R. economic order. Back then, the U.S. government still managed much of the economy, including where planes, trains and trucks could go and how much they could charge. And while deregulation began under Jimmy Carter, Reagan was able to link Carter with an approach to economic governance that was, indeed, collapsing. Twelve years later, Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush shared a broad view of how the U.S. economy should run, but Clinton convinced voters he would be a better manager.
Early on, Romney portrayed himself as a radical transformer. But as polls favored Obama, he seemed to shift to a Clintonian approach. And even though Ralph Loew, a 65-year-old lawyer in Connecticut, told me he doesn't pay much attention to the economy, he has been affected by the dissonance. Loew says Romney ''would be a capable president,'' but he says he will probably end up pulling the lever for Obama. He says he doesn't know all that much about economic policy. (''I wouldn't want to get into the nitty-gritty of lots of the issues that are involved. That part of it doesn't interest me.'') Either man, he says, could probably do just fine, so he will stick with the guy who has the job now. At least Loew, unlike so many nonpartisans, will actually vote.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. The biggest economic battles are behind us.
2. Undecided voters know this better than anyone.
3. Even if they don't know many of the details.
4. Amid consensus, it's tough to run an economy-based challenge.

HEADLINE: Rinse and Repeat

BYLINE: By CHUCK KLOSTERMAN

 BODY:
My boyfriend often travels for business. I always ask him to bring back the shampoo and conditioner from the hotel room and, if he is staying multiple nights, to put the shampoo in his suitcase so that the maid will replace it and he can bring home an additional bottle. He says this is stealing. I say the shampoo is included in the price of the room, and the room is not discounted the second night, so therefore the second bottle of shampoo is included the second night. Incidentally, I haven't purchased shampoo or conditioner in over four years, a point of pride for me. Your thoughts? S.B., NEW YORK, N.Y.
This is a minor transgression that prompts a brilliant question: Is it possible to steal something you've already paid for? Most of the time, the answer is no. But in this situation, the answer is yes. 
When you purchase (or -- more accurately -- rent) a hotel room, part of the purchase involves shampoo and conditioner. They factor that into the overall cost. But the purchase is understood to be conditional. It's ''conditional conditioner.'' The condition is that this product will be used inside the room; it's one aspect of the experience. The hotel can't enforce that the product never leaves the premises (and they probably don't care, all things considered), but the assumption is that everyone understands that this transaction is limited to the facility. Look at it like this: When you stay in a decent hotel, it's the hotel's responsibility to provide an operational remote control for the TV. If the batteries die while you're there, you can call the front desk and they'll immediately replace them. How would you feel if your boyfriend always returned from his business trips with a bunch of (slightly used) AA batteries in his suitcase, based on an argument that the hotel is contractually obligated to replace whatever batteries he removes from the remote?
Though your thinking in this circumstance is not without merit, my suspicion is that you know your boyfriend's argument is more reasonable than your own. Why else would you note that avoiding shampoo purchases for the past four years is ''a point of pride''? What are you proud of? You're proud of the fact that you've found a way to get something free.
A BRITISH INVASION
I think the invasion of privacy of Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, was outrageous. However, I soon found myself searching for her topless photos online. Am I sick, psychotic, hypocritical or normal? CHUCK MACKEY, BERWYN, PA.
You're (probably) not sick, and you're (probably) not psychotic. You're a little hypocritical, which means you're normal. But the real question is whether it was unethical for you to look for these photos. And though your impulse was natural, the answer is yes.
Middleton is a British public figure, so the legality of this situation is debatable. But legality is not the issue here; something legal can still be unethical. Middleton was photographed without her consent, solely for commercial purposes driven by the prurient content of the images and the private nature of what was captured. Outlets that publish those photos can make no justifiable argument for doing so, beyond the fact that people want to see them. The pictures have no social or cultural value and damage (or at least embarrass) the person involved. Every aspect of this process is unethical, including your participation. Your interest perpetuates the demand for similar photographs and contributes to their economic worth.
Now, for the sake of transparency, I'm going to be more honest than necessary: I looked at these photographs, too. I knew it was wrong, and I did it anyway. Sometimes that happens. In order to maintain a free society, the legal system must protect the ability of journalists to take and distribute photographs of public figures in public settings. But this is an abuse of that principle, pursued for bad motives (both on their behalf and on ours).
GALA GAUCHENESS
My 16-year-old daughter led a charity-race team that raises funds for cancer research. Each year, the race team raises a great deal of money, and -- in thanks -- the foundation provides the team captain with two complimentary tickets to an annual gala. Unfortunately, the gala invitation was addressed and mailed, in error, to my sister (who was the team captain last year). I just found out that she received and accepted the invitation six weeks ago. Meanwhile, my daughter has been waiting for her tickets to arrive so that she can take me. The gala is now weeks away. My sister won't give them up. What's a mom to do? NAME WITHHELD, CONNECTICUT
Your sister seems to be under the impression that fighting cancer in 2011 allows her to steal in 2012. Unless you are leaving out some pretty profound details, she is 100 percent wrong in this scenario. Call her and give her one final opportunity to give your kid the tickets. If she declines, call the foundation and tell them what has happened; tell them they need to redirect the tickets to your daughter and to bar your sister from the event. You should also tell your daughter what has happened so that she can see how good people can still behave selfishly (and that past acts of charity don't compensate for unethical actions in the future).

HEADLINE: The (Almost) All-American Home

BYLINE: By MIMI SWARTZ

 BODY:
When Karen Lantz, a Houston architect, was in high school, the Armco steel plant where her father had worked for two decades shut down.
''He was 47,'' she said. ''It was tough.''
He found other jobs, but the financial loss stung, and the family's options became more limited. 
Lantz put herself through community college and then architecture school at the University of Houston. Now 37, Lantz is a working architect, but in 2009, when she started planning her dream house in the grip of a recession, her father's experience weighed on her.
People all over the United States were out of work; if she bought American-made products for the house, she could do her part. But how far could she take it? Was it possible to build a house entirely of products made in America?
Some things were easy. Lantz traveled to a quarry in Lueders, Tex., to find chocolate-brown limestone. The marble chips that made up her terrazzo came from Marble Falls. She found Heatlok Soy 200 foam insulation in Arlington and windows manufactured in Stafford. Other items required her to look further afield: Lantz bought shower drains from Iowa, a skylight made in South Carolina, hose valves made in Alabama, fences from California and baseboards from Georgia. She developed the skills of a private investigator.
Some companies would claim ''Made in U.S.A.'' when they had just a sales office in the U.S.; others claimed an American provenance when they were assembled here from foreign parts, like the pool finish that contained Australian sand.
Lantz's toughest battles were over what she calls ''the jewelry and accessories in architecture,'' like appliances, faucets and lighting fixtures. ''If you Google 'made in U.S.A.,' it can be bad,'' she said. ''It's not high design. That's what's tough, and that's what our industrial designers are weak on.''
So it was with the edge pulls: the handles that would fit flush along the face of cabinets made of shimmering, dark-hued sinker cypress reclaimed from Florida river bottoms. Lantz showed me two such pulls.
To my eye, they looked pretty much the same. Each had clean lines and a soft finish of gently weathered bronze. Each felt equally heavy in the hand.
''This one?'' Lantz said, picking up the pull on the left and turning it over for my inspection. ''From Italy. Nine dollars.'' She picked up the one on her right. ''This one?'' She paused. ''China. Four dollars.''
The U.S.-made pull that was closest to what she wanted cost $72. She called company after company trying to do better. When she asked why the American pulls cost so much more than those made overseas, the answers ranged from ''We make them here'' to ''It's a classic.''
Time passed; the cabinet installers grew restless. Finally, Lantz gave in and bought Italian. (She has tried to avoid Chinese products since problems with contaminated drywall surfaced in the early 2000s.)
''I needed 160 of them,'' she explained. ''It was a big price difference, and I just couldn't do it. I tried, but I just couldn't do it.''
Near completion on the house, Lantz estimates she came within 90 percent of her goal. In addition to the pulls, she gave in to sinks from Germany and faucets from Italy, and when Lantz fell in love with solar panels designed in Colorado but manufactured in China, she threw in the towel.
Lantz calculates that the cost of her Made in the U.S.A. house to a client -- who would have to pay an architect, contractor, etc. -- would come in at around $250 a square foot, more than some custom luxury homes in Houston but less than most. Lantz figures she made something of lasting value.
''I built it to be here 100 years,'' she said. ''But if the day comes, it's all recyclable.''

HEADLINE: Go Ahead, Milk My Day

BYLINE: By SAM ANDERSON

 BODY:
Buffalo mozzarella is the Great White Whale of American cheesemaking: a dream so exotic and powerful that it drives otherwise sensible people into ruinous monomaniacal quests. Despite all the recent triumphs of our country's foodie movement (heirloom-turkey-sausage saffron Popsicles; cardamom paprika mayonnaise foam), no one in the United States has, as of yet, figured out how to recreate precisely this relatively simple Old World delicacy -- a food with essentially one ingredient (buffalo milk) that is made every day in Italy. Over the last 15 years, in fact, the attempt to make authentic buffalo mozzarella -- to nail both its taste and texture -- has destroyed businesses from Vermont to Los Angeles. It seems truly doomed. ''A Polar wind blows through it,'' Melville might have written about it, if he had been a food writer, ''and birds of prey hover over it.''
At the risk of straining the analogy, you could call me the Ishmael of this quest. 
I do not, normally, have foodie tendencies. I grew up loving tuna casserole covered in potato chips, and roughly two-thirds of my body weight is ketchup. I have never tasted caviar or foie gras. And yet something about buffalo mozzarella calls to me. Ever since I discovered the cheese's existence, sometime in my 20s, I've thought about it, and eaten it, probably more than is good for me. It's one of the only foods that I'll order, automatically, whenever I see it on a menu. Once, years ago, apropos of nothing, I made my family take a road trip to visit a buffalo dairy in Vermont -- a dairy whose insanely expensive buffalo-milk yogurt I was spending a large portion of my tiny income on. That dairy, inevitably, went out of business several years later, which saved me plenty of money but caused me an equal amount of emotional pain.
If this seems like a lot of hubbub over an obscure variant of a readily available cheese, it is not. Fresh mozzarella di bufala is one of the miracles of Italian cuisine. It's exactly like regular mozzarella except that it's made with milk squeezed out of a buffalo -- which is a little like saying that the Hope diamond is exactly like a plastic replica of the Hope diamond except that it's made out of priceless crystallized carbon. Buffalo milk has roughly twice the fat of cow milk, which makes it decadently creamy and flavorful. The good stuff is almost unrealistically soft -- it seems like the reason the word ''mouthfeel'' was invented -- with a depth of flavor that makes even the freshest hand-pulled artisanal cow-milk mozzarella taste like glorified string cheese. Buffalo mozzarella is the apotheosis of dairy: the golden mean between yogurt and custard and cottage cheese and heavy cream and ricotta. It lives (along with clouds and mercury and lava and photons and quicksand) on the mystical border between solid and liquid. Descriptions of it tend toward poetry. ''When cut,'' the cheesemonger Steven Jenkins has written, ''it will weep its own whey with a sweet, beckoning, lactic aroma.''
Why, then, is it so impossible to get truly fresh buffalo mozzarella in the United States? Well, there are all kinds of reasons.
Consider, first off, the conditions in Italy, which are basically perfect. Water buffalo have lived in the hills around Naples for around 1,000 years. (To be clear: these are not the big, brown, wild, hairy bison of the American prairies; they're the smooth, dark, curly-horned beasts you might expect to see in a documentary about rice farming in China.) One Italian cheesemaker told me that the animals first came to Italy when Hannibal used them to carry his war treasure back from Asia -- a story that is historically dubious but does manage to capture the cheese's almost mythic exoticism. After so many centuries of practice, modern Italians have buffalo dairying down to a science: animal genetics, human expertise, farming infrastructure -- it's all in place and perfectly integrated. If you walk into a shop in Naples and ask for mozzarella, you will get a ball of buffalo milk that probably congealed only hours before. (For the vastly inferior cow's-milk version -- the default in American stores -- you have to ask by a whole different name: fior di latte.)
Italy is a quintessentially Old World country -- a quilt of microregions, each fiercely loyal to its own traditions and cuisines -- which means that it's perfectly natural to expect your cheese to have been made locally that day. This expectation has been woven so deeply into the fabric of daily life, by so many generations of cheese eaters, that the market for it is guaranteed. And Italy is small enough that, if you do move a fresh product from one major city to the next, it takes only a couple of hours.
The conditions in the United States are the opposite of that. Our water-buffalo herds are sparse and, for the purposes of dairying, practically feral. They're difficult to acquire and expensive to raise. They produce only a fraction of the milk you get from a typical dairy cow, and they are so psychologically fragile that it's hard to even get that much out of them.
Once you do get milk, it's hard to know exactly what to do with it. The Old World secrets of mozzarella production have mostly stayed in the Old World; I've yet to eat a ball of the domestically produced stuff that even begins to compare. (It tends to be rubbery, like a giant white pencil eraser.)
Then there's the problem of distribution. Our country is huge: essentially 31 Italys glued together. Our food system, accordingly, is organized around supermarkets, which favor processed foods with long shelf lives, not fragile cheeses intended to be eaten within hours of their making. Many Americans don't even know that buffalo mozzarella is a thing: we've developed a taste for hard little vacuum-packed balls of nearly flavorless cow's milk that we can melt easily over pizza.
All of which combines to make the economics of water-buffalo dairying in the United States totally brutal.
Of course, Ahab, rather famously, didn't stop sailing just because Moby-Dick was hard to find. If anything, that made him only more obsessive.
Enter Craig Ramini, the latest American adventurer hellbent on making fresh buffalo mozzarella -- one of the very few people in the United States currently brave or foolish enough to do so.
In August, very early one morning, I drove out to Ramini's farm, 60 miles north of San Francisco, in the tiny coastal town of Tomales. (He rents a 25-acre corner of a larger ranch, a hill or two away from the Pacific Ocean, that has been in the same family for generations.) I drove between rows of eucalyptus trees weeping mist, and although I had come to see the buffalo, I was still surprised when I saw them -- after miles and miles of cows, they looked like prehistoric beasts lost in the fog.
Ramini is tall and slim, a former college shortstop; he wore khaki cargo pants and a white Ralph Lauren shirt. He's relatively new to the world of cheese, and his road there was unorthodox. He spent most of the last decade working in Silicon Valley, where his specialty was hooking up hot young programmers with the big corporations that needed their digital services. In the summer of 2009, however, at age 51, Ramini had an epiphany. He decided he wanted to change his life, and he proceeded to do so in a very Silicon Valley way: he stuck Post-it notes all over one wall of his house to form (as he put it) ''a Mind Map of happiness and fulfillment.'' Three clusters of Post-its emerged: large animals, entrepreneurship and Italian food. (Ramini's grandfather, an immigrant from Italy, owned an Italian restaurant that Ramini spent a lot of time in as a child.) Buffalo mozzarella, Ramini realized, was a hole in the market that happened to lie right at the intersection of his happiness clusters. Although he was not, at the time, a great fan of cheese, and he had never interacted with a water buffalo, he decided that this was his new calling. He leapt into the project as if he were developing an app.â[#x20ac]©It became clear to him almost immediately, however, that Northern California was not Italy and that buffalo mozzarella wasn't going to behave like a dot-com start-up. Ramini has spent three years getting over the most basic hurdles: assembling enough animals (he has a herd of 44) and coaxing milk out of them (he had to redesign his barn and stalls, and he's still taking in only 60 gallons of milk a week -- about a ninth of his goal) -- and beginning the daunting process of turning that milk into perfectly formed cheese. There have been some disastrous moments and plenty of sleepless nights. The first few months' worth of batches weren't even close to being viable. So he hired two Italian cheese consultants to help guide him. Although he says the product is improving, he still hasn't been able to get it right. When I visited him, he had yet to sell a single ball of mozzarella.
At his farm, Ramini helped me into tall rubber boots, guided me through an antiseptic boot wash and then welcomed me into his cheese factory. The word ''factory,'' in this case, is probably a little grand: there were only two tiny rooms -- 250 square feet altogether -- with a concrete floor, stainless-steel tables and white-tile walls. (''A lot of what I'm doing,'' Ramini said, ''is trying to be clever with limited space.'') It felt like a cross between a restaurant kitchen, a science lab, an operating room and a prison cell. Ramini and I stayed in that space, just the two of us, with only a few short breaks, for the next 11 hours.
Buffalo milk is about 80 percent water, and turning it into cheese involves getting rid of most of that. The cheesemaking day turns out to operate on a similar ratio: 80 percent idle time, 20 percent action. You note a temperature or sprinkle some bacterial powder, then sit around for 90 minutes, then note another temperature, then sit around again. Ramini and I endured long stretches of silence. Sometimes it felt as if we were in an avant-garde play. We stared out the window to watch a pair of Black Angus calves trying to nurse from a Holstein mother. Meanwhile, Ramini's small batch of precious milk, collected painstakingly over the previous three days, heated and cooled and churned and curdled and drained its whey in a stainless-steel vat.
Between the silences, Ramini told me things: facts, biography, business plans, dreams. Buffalo semen, he said, arrives from Italy in a container of liquid nitrogen that looks like R2-D2. A buffalo cervix comprises three concentric rings. Buffaloes don't moo; they bark like seals. At some point Ramini gave me a cup of fresh buffalo milk, which was pleasantly rich and coated the inside of my mouth. We drank coffee with buffalo milk in it and exchanged stories about Larry Bird. Ramini grew up ''a country-club kid'' from Massachusetts, the son of a doctor who had courtside seats during the Celtics' glory days. After a few hours, I found myself fluent in the esoterica of cheese: agitators, stretch testing, pH windows, rennet, airspace probes. Eventually, the fog burned off, exposing a layer of blue that had apparently been there all along.
That day, Ramini was tweaking his recipe -- more starter culture, lower temperatures -- in hopes that his final product would be a little more tender. ''The elusive thing,'' he said, ''is softness.''
There's a metaphor there, perhaps.
Ramini admits to having the classic Silicon Valley personality -- Type A, obsessive, self-promoting -- and this has not always gone over well with the laid-back, lower-profile, communally spirited artisanal cheesemakers in the Bay Area. Ramini is media-savvy and has somehow managed to generate national attention before producing any first-rate cheese. (''That's catchy,'' he said about my Great White Whale theory of buffalo mozzarella. ''I wish I had thought of that myself. I'd have been using it for over a year now.'') He seems to see many of his artisanal-cheese-world competitors as financially naÃ¯ve, given the fact that, despite all their high principles and fellow-feeling, they can't afford to quit their day jobs because they manage to give away so many of their profits to middlemen. Ramini's goals are more ambitious: to fill his 79-gallon vat with buffalo milk every single day, turn it into perfect mozzarella and sell it directly to restaurants and consumers, with no middlemen, for $35 a pound -- a plan that he calculates would yield around $1.5 million a year and set him up for the rest of his life.
''I haven't met a cheesemaker yet who says, 'That's a brilliant idea,' '' Ramini told me. ''Tuning out part of the community was not in my business plan. It's an unforeseen challenge.''
When the fog finally rolled back in, around 6 p.m., Ramini had turned his batch of milk into 30 wet white bricks of mozzarella curd -- the raw material of one of the most elusive cheeses on earth.
He crumbled one of the brick's edges into rough little chunks, over which he poured hot water. The first batch didn't act right -- the chunks wouldn't cohere -- so Ramini waited 20 minutes and tried again. It didn't work. He waited 20 more minutes, then 20 more. On the fifth try, the curds did exactly what he wanted them to: they fused together and got stretchy and soft, and Ramini squeezed them into a smooth, pure white ball that looked like the real Italian thing. He sliced it. We tried it. It tasted good, like the milk, but it was rubbery, squeaky against our teeth -- very much not Italian. The elusive softness eluded him still.
Ramini says texture is the final hurdle, and while he's confident that he will get over it eventually, he has little idea when that's going to happen or who's going to help him or where that person might be. He's planning a trip to Italy, with a local chef, in hopes that someone there might give him the answer.
After my trip to Ramini's farm, I spoke with Raffaele Mascolo, a cheese consultant who is originally from Naples but now lives in Wisconsin. Mascolo was one of the Italian experts who worked, for a couple of weeks, with Ramini. Together they managed to produce, Mascolo told me, ''decent'' mozzarella. He praised Ramini's intelligence and passion but said that, in spite of those qualities, it could still take him a lot of time -- another year or two, maybe -- to produce consistently high-quality mozzarella. It's not the world's most difficult cheese, Mascolo said, but it's also not something you can rush.
We were talking via Skype, and Mascolo left the screen for a minute. He came back with a handful of cheeses he had made -- caciocavallo and caciotta -- to show me. At one point he popped a small ball of mozzarella (made in Minnesota out of a blend of cow and goat cheese) into his mouth and actually exclaimed, ''Mamma mia!'' He showed me a wooden statue of a water buffalo that he keeps in his home. ''This is my God,'' he said.
I recognized, I thought, a familiar glint in his eye, and sure enough, toward the end of our conversation, Mascolo told me that he was thinking about getting into the buffalo-mozzarella business. When I asked him for details, he was mysterious, but the look was still there, as was the surge of hope in my heart. As Melville the food writer might have put it: ''Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.''

You've described exactly how my husband and I feel. We have no kids, haven't owned cars for nearly nine years and have no debt. We rent a tiny apartment.

HEADLINE: Vote for the Dinner Party

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POLLAN

 BODY:
One of the more interesting things we will learn on Nov. 6 is whether or not there is a ''food movement'' in America worthy of the name -- that is, an organized force in our politics capable of demanding change in the food system. People like me throw the term around loosely, partly because we sense the gathering of such a force, and partly (to be honest) to help wish it into being by sheer dint of repetition. Clearly there is growing sentiment in favor of reforming American agriculture and interest in questions about where our food comes from and how it was produced. And certainly we can see an alternative food economy rising around us: local and organic agriculture is growing far faster than the food market as a whole. But a market and a sentiment are not quite the same thing as a political movement -- something capable of frightening politicians and propelling its concerns onto the national agenda. 
California's Proposition 37, which would require that genetically modified (G.M.) foods carry a label, has the potential to do just that -- to change the politics of food not just in California but nationally too. Now, there is much that's wrong with California's notorious initiative process: it is an awkward, usually sloppy way to make law. Yet for better or worse, it has served as a last- or first-ditch way for issues that politicians aren't yet ready to touch -- whether the tax rebellion of the 1970s (Prop 13) or medical marijuana in the 1990s (Prop 215) -- to win a hearing and a vote and then go on to change the political conversation across the country.
What is at stake this time around is not just the fate of genetically modified crops but the public's confidence in the industrial food chain. That system is being challenged on a great many fronts -- indeed, seemingly everywhere but in Washington. Around the country, dozens of proposals to tax and regulate soda have put the beverage industry on the defensive, forcing it to play a very expensive (and thus far successful) game of Whac-A-Mole. The meat industry is getting it from all sides: animal rights advocates seeking to expose its brutality; public-health advocates campaigning against antibiotics in animal feed; environmentalists highlighting factory farming's contribution to climate change.
Big Food is also feeling beleaguered by its increasingly skeptical and skittish consumers. Earlier this year the industry was rocked when a blogger in Houston started an online petition to ban the use of ''pink slime'' in the hamburger served in the federal school-lunch program. Pink slime -- so-called by a U.S. Department of Agriculture microbiologist -- is a kind of industrial-strength hamburger helper made from a purée of slaughterhouse scraps treated with ammonia. We have apparently been ingesting this material for years in hamburger patties, but when word got out, the eating public went ballistic. Within days, the U.S.D.A. allowed schools to drop the product, and several supermarket chains stopped carrying it, shuttering several of the plants that produce it. Shortly after this episode, I received a panicky phone call from someone in the food industry, a buyer for one of the big food-service companies. After venting about the ''irrationality'' of the American consumer, he then demanded to know: ''Who's going to be hit next? It could be any of us.''
So it appears the loss of confidence is mutual: the food industry no longer trusts us, either, which is one reason a label on genetically modified food is so terrifying: we might react ''irrationally'' and decline to buy it. To win back this restive public, Big Food recently began a multimillion-dollar public-relations campaign, featuring public ''food dialogues,'' aimed at restoring our faith in the production methods on which industrial agriculture depends, including pharmaceuticals used to keep animals healthy and speed their growth; pesticides and genetically modified seeds; and concentrated animal feeding operations. The industry has never liked to talk about these practices -- which is to say, about how the food we eat is actually produced -- but it apparently came to the conclusion that it is better off telling the story itself rather than letting its critics do it.
This new transparency goes only so far, however. The industry is happy to boast about genetically engineered crops in the elite precincts of the op-ed and business pages -- as a technology needed to feed the world, combat climate change, solve Africa's problems, etc. -- but still would rather not mention it to the consumers who actually eat the stuff. Presumably that silence owes to the fact that, to date, genetically modified foods don't offer the eater any benefits whatsoever -- only a potential, as yet undetermined risk. So how irrational would it be, really, to avoid them?
Surely this explains why Monsanto and its allies have fought the labeling of genetically modified food so vigorously since 1992, when the industry managed to persuade the Food and Drug Administration -- over the objection of its own scientists -- that the new crops were ''substantially equivalent'' to the old and so did not need to be labeled, much less regulated. This represented a breathtaking exercise of both political power (the F.D.A. policy was co-written by a lawyer whose former firm worked for Monsanto) and product positioning: these new crops were revolutionary enough (a ''new agricultural paradigm,'' Monsanto said) to deserve patent protection and government support, yet at the same time the food made from them was no different than it ever was, so did not need to be labeled. It's worth noting that ours was one of only a very few governments ever sold on this convenient reasoning: more than 60 other countries have seen fit to label genetically modified food, including those in the European Union, Japan, Russia and China.
To prevent the United States from following suit, Monsanto and DuPont, the two leading merchants of genetically modified seed, have invested more than $12 million to defeat Prop 37. They've been joined in this effort by the Grocery Manufacturers Association, whose president declared at a meeting last July that defeating Prop 37 would be the group's top priority for 2012. Answering the call, many of America's biggest food and beverage makers -- including PepsiCo, Nestlé, Coca-Cola and General Mills -- have together ponied up tens of millions of dollars to, in effect, fight transparency about their products.
Americans have been eating genetically engineered food for 18 years, and as supporters of the technology are quick to point out, we don't seem to be dropping like flies. But they miss the point. The fight over labeling G.M. food is not foremost about food safety or environmental harm, legitimate though these questions are. The fight is about the power of Big Food. Monsanto has become the symbol of everything people dislike about industrial agriculture: corporate control of the regulatory process; lack of transparency (for consumers) and lack of choice (for farmers); an intensifying rain of pesticides on ever-expanding monocultures; and the monopolization of seeds, which is to say, of the genetic resources on which all of humanity depends.
These are precisely the issues that have given rise to the so-called food movement. Yet that movement has so far had more success in building an alternative food chain than it has in winning substantive changes from Big Food or Washington. In the last couple of decades, a new economy of farmers' markets, community-supported agriculture (also known as farm shares) and sustainable farming has changed the way millions of Americans eat and think about food. From this perspective, the food movement is an economic and a social movement, and as such has made important gains. People by the millions have begun, as the slogan goes, to vote with their forks in favor of more sustainably and humanely produced food, and against agribusiness. But does that kind of vote constitute a genuine politics? Yes and no.
It's easy to dismiss voting with your fork as merely a lifestyle choice, and an elite one at that. Yet there is a hopeful kind of soft politics at work here, as an afternoon at any of America's 7,800-plus farmers' markets will attest. Money-for-food is not the only transaction going on at the farmers' markets; indeed, it may be the least of it. Neighbors are talking to neighbors. Consumers meet producers. (Confirming the obvious, one social scientist found that people have 10 times as many conversations at the farmers' market as they do at the supermarket.) City meets country. Kids discover what food is. Activists circulate petitions. The farmers' market has become the country's liveliest new public square, an outlet for our communitarian impulses and a means of escaping, or at least complicating, the narrow role that capitalism usually assigns to us as ''consumers.'' At the farmers' market, we are consumers, yes, but at the same time also citizens, neighbors, parents and cooks. In voting with our food dollars, we enlarge our sense of our ''interests'' from the usual concern with a good value to, well, a concern with values.
This is no small thing; it has revitalized local farming and urban communities and at the same time raised the bar on the food industry, which now must pay attention (or at least lip service) to things like sustainable farming and the humane treatment of animals. Yet this sort of soft politics, useful as it may be in building new markets and even new forms of civil society, has its limits. Not everyone can afford to participate in the new food economy. If the food movement doesn't move to democratize the benefits of good food, it will be -- and will deserve to be -- branded as elitist.
That's why, sooner or later, the food movement will have to engage in the hard politics of Washington -- of voting with votes, not just forks. This is an arena in which it has thus far been much less successful. It has won little more than crumbs in the most recent battle over the farm bill (which every five years sets federal policy for agriculture and nutrition programs), a few improvements in school lunch and food safety and the symbol of an organic garden at the White House. The modesty of these achievements shouldn't surprise us: the food movement is young and does not yet have its Sierra Club or National Rifle Association, large membership organizations with the clout to reward and punish legislators. Thus while Big Food may live in fear of its restive consumers, its grip on Washington has not been challenged.
Yet. Next month in California, a few million people will vote with their votes on a food issue. Already, Prop 37 has ignited precisely the kind of debate -- about the risks and benefits of genetically modified food; about transparency and the consumer's right to know -- that Monsanto and its allies have managed to stifle in Washington for nearly two decades. If Prop 37 passes, and the polls suggest its chances are good, then that debate will most likely go national and a new political dynamic will be set in motion.
It's hard to predict exactly how things will play out if Prop 37 is approved. Expect the industry to first try to stomp out the political brush fire by taking the new California law to court on the grounds that a state cannot pre-empt a federal regulation. One problem with that argument is that, thanks to the bio-tech industry's own lobbying prowess, there is no federal regulation on labeling, only an informal ruling, and therefore nothing to pre-empt. (I believe this is what is meant by being hoist with your own petard.) To avoid having to slap the dread letters on their products, many food companies will presumably reformulate their products with non-G.M. ingredients, creating a new market for farmers and for companies selling non-G.M. seed. The solidarity of Monsanto and companies like Coca-Cola -- which reaps no benefit from using G.M. corn in its corn syrup -- might then quickly crumble. Rather than deal with different labeling laws in different states, food makers would probably prefer to negotiate a single national label on G.M. foods. Consumer groups like the Just Label It campaign, which has collected 1.2 million signatures on a petition to force the F.D.A. to label G.M. foods, thus far to no avail, would suddenly find themselves with a seat at the table and a strong political hand.
One person in Washington who would surely take note of the California vote is President Obama. During the 2008 campaign, he voiced support for many of the goals of the food movement, including the labeling of G.M. food. (''We'll let folks know whether their food has been genetically modified,'' he declared in an Iowa speech in 2007, ''because Americans should know what they're buying.'') As president he has failed to keep that promise, but he has taken some positive steps: his U.S.D.A. has done much to nurture the local-food economy, for example. Perhaps most important, Michelle Obama began a national conversation about food and health -- soft politics, yes, but these often help prepare the soil for the other kind. Yet on the hard issues, the ones that challenge agribusiness-as-usual, President Obama has so far declined to spend his political capital and on more than one occasion has taken Monsanto's side. He has treated the food movement as a sentiment rather than a power, and who can blame him?
Until now. Over the last four years I've had occasion to speak to several people who have personally lobbied the president on various food issues, including G.M. labeling, and from what I can gather, Obama's attitude toward the food movement has always been: What movement? I don't see it. Show me. On Nov. 6, the voters of California will have the opportunity to do just that.

HEADLINE: An Allroad Without Ups and Downs

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
AUDI says the introduction of a new Allroad wagon for the American market, after an eight-year absence, signifies the ''return of the icon.''
When the original model was withdrawn from the United States after the 2005 model year, it seemed less like an icon than a sales disappointment -- some 26,000 were sold over four years, well below initial estimates. But Audi now considers the first Allroad ''quite the success, for its day, for not being an S.U.V.,'' a company spokesman, Mark Dahncke, said last week.
Audi wagons are quite popular in Europe, and the Allroad continued to sell well there even after it became an orphan over here. Surviving Allroads still have a devoted following in the United States, selling even now at five-figure prices. 
The original car's $40,000 sticker price seemed steep in the early 2000s, and that is surely one reason it didn't sell better. The handsome new Allroad is still around $40,000 -- $39,600 and a $875 delivery fee, to be exact. At a glance, given the inflation in German luxury cars of late, such a price seems more palatable than it did a decade ago. But unlike its predecessor, which came pretty well equipped in basic trim, the new Allroad's window sticker can easily zoom higher. The top-line Prestige trim package adds $9,200 by itself, and Audi offers many, many more options.
But one deal-making feature is not available, even as an option: a height-adjustable pneumatic suspension that raised the original model 2.6 inches for additional ground clearance when off-roading or storming through snow drifts. The air suspension is one of the features that made the Allroad more than a station wagon.
So the new Allroad's ground clearance is a rather modest 7.1 inches, just 1.5 inches more than the A4 Avant wagon it replaces. For comparison's sake, a Subaru Outback offers 8.7 inches. The Allroad does have a stainless steel skid plate, ostensibly to protect the underside from rocks, underbrush and other debris, but it seems more ornamental than utilitarian.
Most measurements are either the same, or about a half-inch greater, than the A4 Avant's. The dimensions are also similar to the 2001-5 Allroad, even though that wagon was based on the A6 of the time. Put simply, the A4 has a larger footprint now, as does the A6.
The Allroad offers the same 50 cubic feet of cargo capacity, with the rear seat folded, as the outgoing A4 Avant, but Audi says the space is more usable. The interior is thoroughly updated and quite plush; standard leather seating is an advantage over rivals like the Volvo XC70 or the BMW 328i xDrive Sports Wagon.
The Allroad shares the A4 Avant's 2-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, which makes 211 horsepower and 256 pound-feet of peak torque. Mileage is rated 20 m.p.g. in the city and 27 on the highway on premium fuel (compared with 21/29 for the outgoing Avant). Audi says the Allroad will accelerate from a stop to 60 m.p.h. in a sprightly 6.6 seconds.
On the road, the Allroad's ride height, extra weight and big 18-inch wheels and tires make it handle more like an S.U.V. and less like an Audi sedan. And while the ride is as butter-smooth as the Avant's, the Allroad can tackle a broader spectrum of light-duty driving challenges.
Still, it's no off-roader.
Most disappointingly, despite the capable quattro all-wheel-drive system, the Allroad is no longer equipped to scramble up rocky hillsides or bound through deeply rutted trails, or pull itself out of mud-bog gumbo like the original model. Audi does not even list performance measures like the towing capacity or the approach and departure angles -- matters of interest to off-roaders -- for the Allroad.
For more diabolical on- and off-road conditions, the far less expensive Outback may be a more capable choice.
When merely crunching numbers, there is a temptation to dismiss the Allroad as little more than an A4 Avant with skid plates, plastic cladding on the wheel arches and a $3,000 price bump.
But beyond the specifications, on a purely subjective basis, the well-proportioned, generally pleasing Allroad falls somewhere between the Avant station wagon and Audi's quite capable, less expensive Q5 sport utility. In that regard, it fills a niche in the lineup rather handsomely.
INSIDE TRACK: The road less trammeled.

HEADLINE: The Game Gets a Moment In Pop Culture's Spotlight

BYLINE: By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

 BODY:
Is chess cool? Judging by a new movie, Vogue magazine, a book and a pop star's comments, it is.
The movie, a documentary called ''Brooklyn Castle'' about a Brooklyn school's chess team that has won more than 20 national championships, opens on Friday. To promote the film, the actor Adrian Grenier, who became a fan of the movie after seeing an early screening, played a match of three blitz games in Washington Square Park against Pobo Efekoro, one of the team's members. (Pobo won all three games.) 
Then there is the singer Carly Rae Jepsen, whose song ''Call Me Maybe'' has been the biggest hit of the year. In a recent interview with The San Francisco Examiner, she said that she loved chess but that no one in her band could play and her assistant is not very good. She said she had asked her stepfather to teach her the game so she could impress a boy when she was in high school.
The August issue of Vogue included a photographic spread that featured Alexandra Kosteniuk, 28, the former women's world champion. It was not an unusual assignment for Kosteniuk, who has been modeling for years.
And finally, articles about the historic 1997 match in which the I.B.M. computer Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov have appeared in The Washington Post and Wired magazine, inspired by a book by Nate Silver, who also writes the FiveThirtyEight column on politics for The New York Times. In the book, ''The Signal and the Noise,'' which is about the science of predictions, Silver writes that Deep Blue's crucial move in the match might have been caused by a computer bug.
It is not the first time that chess has bridged cultural divides. In August, an unusual blitz game in New York pitted Magnus Carlsen, 21, a Norwegian who is ranked No. 1 in the world, against Kenneth Rogoff, 59, a Harvard economist who is considered one of the world's leading authorities on government debt. Rogoff is also a grandmaster, but even he was surprised when the game ended in a draw.
In an e-mail last week, Rogoff said he was nervous because he had not played in over 30 years, not even for fun. He said he calmed down a bit when Carlsen played the Breyer Defense in the Ruy Lopez, an opening that Rogoff remembered from his youth.
He said that he was surprised Carlsen let him play 22 Qh5 and that he thought Carlsen's 25 ... f6 was a mistake because it let him force trades of pieces.
In the end, Rogoff said in the e-mail, ''I understand better than anyone that this was a total freak occurrence, even taking into account that it was a friendly blitz game.''

HEADLINE: William C. Friday, University of North Carolina Leader, Dies at 92

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
William C. Friday, a politically deft lawyer who, with scant scholarly qualifications, steered the University of North Carolina through three decades of tumultuous growth and helped scale back federal desegregation demands, died on Friday at his home in Chapel Hill, N.C. He was 92.
Thomas W. Ross, the university's president, announced the death. 
Mr. Friday, who retired as president in 1986, molded the state's public colleges and universities into a single system, increased its student body more than eightfold and was a force behind the creation of Research Triangle Park, a university-corporate collaboration that fired North Carolina's economy by attracting high-tech industries to the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area.
His biggest challenge was in addressing federal orders to desegregate the system's 16 universities -- five overwhelmingly black and 11 white. He advised moderation rather than the immediate introduction of the large changes demanded by Washington, even if he was portrayed, he said, as a ''redneck hero.''
Many in the 1970s regarded the desegregation of higher education as a logical next step after the Supreme Court's 1954 order to integrate public schools. Mr. Friday called desegregation ''the greatest social issue we have faced in generations.'' The question was how to desegregate and how fast.
Mr. Friday said he and other Southern university administrators fighting Washington were defending academic freedom.
The fight began when the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund sued in 1970, alleging that North Carolina and other states maintained illegally segregated public universities. A federal judge ordered the states to devise integration plans. The fund called North Carolina's cautious response ''denial'' and ''defiance.'' The discussion intensified in 1977 when President Jimmy Carter brought in a tough new team of civil rights enforcers.
As the goal was educational equality for blacks -- not just integration -- there were two areas to address. The first was integrating the traditionally white universities. The second was improving the quality of the traditionally black universities, which had been created in Southern states as part of the old Jim Crow system of racial segregation. Over the years, blacks themselves had embraced them as an engine of upward mobility.
The federal government proposed that predominantly white and predominantly black universities, particularly those close to one another, stop offering similar programs. It reasoned that students would voluntarily integrate if the only way they could get the course of instruction they wanted was by attending a university that had historically been identified with the other race.
Mr. Friday saw the plan as heavy-handed. The government should set goals, he said, not dictate remedies. ''North Carolina now provides a college education for a greater percentage of its blacks than most states,'' he said. ''Washington is wrong on this one.''
North Carolina's resistance led to years of legal delays. Finally, in 1981, the Reagan administration, showing more sympathy to the university's position, dropped many of the Carter administration's demands, particularly the one against program duplication. North Carolina agreed to raise black enrollment at white universities to 10.6 percent from 7.4 percent, and whites at black universities to 15 percent from 11.3 percent. It also promised to increase financing for predominantly black schools.
Joseph L. Rauh Jr., a lawyer for the NAACP Legal and Educational Defense Fund, derided the agreement as ''a travesty.'' Mr. Friday called it ''honorable.''
Julius L. Chambers, a civil rights leader, resigned from the university system's board of governors over the deal. He said in an oral history interview that he believed Mr. Friday had shrunk from his own convictions. ''I thought he knew we were moving too slow,'' he said.
William Clyde Friday was born on July 13, 1920, in Raphine, Va., and grew up in a North Carolina mill town. He was high school class president all four years. A $50 scholarship -- half the annual tuition at the time -- allowed Mr. Friday, whose family was hit hard by the Depression, to attend Wake Forest College (now Wake Forest University).
After a year there, he transferred to North Carolina State College of Agriculture and Engineering, now North Carolina State University, where he studied textile engineering and graduated in 1941.
Mr. Friday soon joined the Navy and managed an ammunitions depot. In interviews he said he had been shocked to see blacks given the most dangerous tasks and had started to hate segregation.
After earning a law degree at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1948 he was asked to be U.N.C.'s assistant dean of students. He became a favorite of the university president. In 1955, he rose to secretary of what was then called the Consolidated University of North Carolina, consisting of U.N.C., State College and the Woman's College of the University of North Carolina (now the University of North Carolina at Greensboro).
He was chosen to be president in 1956 from among 144 candidates, most with doctorates and teaching experience.
In 1971, to save money, the legislature decreed that all 16 state-supported colleges and universities be brought under a single administration. This meant that the five traditionally black schools and the 11 white ones were for the first time a single entity. Had the consolidation not been enacted, the federal integration effort would have had to target individual universities.
During his long presidency, Mr. Friday served as co-chairman of the Knight Foundation Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, which examined abuses in college sports. It recommended that university presidents exert more control over their athletic departments.
Mr. Friday is survived by his wife of 70 years, the former Ida Howell, and his daughters Frances and Mary.

I left Los Angeles at 4 in the morning, long before first light, and made it to Bakersfield -- the land of oil derricks, lowriders and truck stops with Punjabi food -- by 6. Ten minutes later, I was in the land of carrots.
You know that huge pile of cello-wrapped carrots in your supermarket? Now imagine that the pile filled the entire supermarket. That's how many carrots I saw upon my arrival at Bolthouse Farms. Something like 50 industrial trucks were filled to the top with carrots, all ready for processing. Bolthouse, along with another large producer, supplies an estimated 85 percent of the carrots eaten by Americans. There are many ways to put this in perspective, and they're all pretty mind-blowing: Bolthouse processes six million pounds of carrots a day. If you took its yield from one week and stacked each carrot from end to end, you could circle the earth. If you took all the carrots the company grows in a year, they would double the weight of the Empire State Building. 
At Bolthouse's complex, carrots whirl around on conveyor belts at up to 50 miles an hour en route to their future as juliennes, coins and stubs, or baby carrots, which the company popularized and which aren't babies. Other carrots become freezer fare, concentrate, salad dressings and beverages. Fiber is separated for tomato sauce and hot dogs. Whatever's left becomes cattle feed.
Bolthouse is just one of the many massive operations of California's expansive Central Valley, which is really two valleys: the San Joaquin to the south and Sacramento to the north. All told, the Central Valley is about 450 miles long, from Bakersfield up to Redding, and is 60 miles at its widest, between the Sierra Nevada to the east and the Coast Ranges to the west. It's larger than nine different states, but size is only one of its defining characteristics: the valley is the world's largest patch of Class 1 soil, the best there is. The 25-degree (or so) temperature swing from day to night is an ideal growing range for plants. The sun shines nearly 300 days a year. The eastern half of the valley (and the western, to some extent) uses ice melt from the Sierra as its water source, which means it doesn't have the same drought and flood problems as the Midwest. The winters are cool, which offers a whole different growing season for plants that cannot take the summer heat. There's no snow.
The valley became widely known in the 1920s and 1930s, when farmers arrived from Virginia or Armenia or Italy or (like Tom Joad) Oklahoma and wrote home about the clean air, plentiful water and cheap land. Now the valley yields a third of all the produce grown in the United States. Unlike the Midwest, which concentrates (devastatingly) on corn and soybeans, more than 230 crops are grown in the valley, including those indigenous to South Asia, Southeast Asia and Mexico, some of which have no names in English. At another large farm, I saw melons, lettuce, asparagus, cabbage, broccoli, chard, collards, prickly pears, almonds, pistachios, grapes and more tomatoes than anyone could conceive of in one place. (The valley is the largest supplier of canned tomatoes in the world too.) Whether you're in Modesto or Montpelier, there's a good chance that the produce you're eating came from the valley.
I came to the valley both by choice and by mandate. In preparation for the magazine's Food and Drink Issue, I asked readers to suggest my assignment. They could send me anywhere they wanted, within limitations of climate and jet lag. After reviewing the suggestions, it became clear that readers wanted an article that incorporated big farming, small farming, sustainability, politics, poverty and, of course, truly delicious food -- and in the United States, if possible. So I decided to head to the Central Valley, where all of this was already happening. This also happened to satisfy a curiosity of mine. From a desk in New York, it's impossible to fathom 50 m.p.h. carrots, hills of almonds, acres of basil and millions of tomatoes all ripening at once. How can all of this possibly work?
But I was also inclined to head to the valley because I know that, for the last century or so, we've been exploiting  -- almost without limitation -- its water, mineral resources, land, air, people and animals. Mark Arax, a writer who lives in Fresno and has chronicled the region's past and present, offered his opinion while serving me and a dozen others marinated lamb, a terrific recipe from his Armenian family: ''This land and its water have gone mostly to the proposition of making a few men very wealthy and consigning generations of others, especially farmworkers, to lives in the dust.'' I'd already seen an example of how wealth has been concentrated and captured in the valley: this summer, Campbell's bought Bolthouse Farms for $1.55 billion. Meanwhile, there are thousands of valley farmworkers who are often victims of wage-theft and (illegally) required to supply their own tools.
So for five days I drove through the southern half of the valley. I wanted to learn as much as I could about the agriculture in America's produce factory; where thoughtful farmers were leading it; and how -- if at all -- it might become sustainable.
I have driven through the valley numerous times, almost always on Interstate 5, where, like everyone else, I have had the experience of getting out of the car and being hit by what felt like a giant hairdryer blowing 120-degree, manure-scented air. Like many others, I've also pulled over to the side of the road and taken pictures of the Harris Ranch in Coalinga, which, if it isn't the largest feedlot in the country (capacity: 100,000 cows), is certainly the one with the most drive-bys.
The best way to enter the valley, though, is from the south, through the Tehachapi Pass, west of the Mojave and Edwards Air Force Base. Although the land is scarred by roads and electric lines, it's still easy to imagine what it looked liked 150 years ago. Not so Fresno, the center of the valley's agriculture industry about 110 miles to the north of Bakersfield. There the valley's problems are readily evident. Since 1970, the population has more than doubled to 6.8 million, virtually all of whom, it seems, drive (more often than not a Ford F-150). The air, trapped between mountain ranges, stinks, and the pollution is consistently ranked among the most severe in the country. Worse, there are so many cows nearby in megadairies and feedlots that the air contains microscopic particles of dried dung, enough so that you can taste it. I smelled it on my clothes when I unpacked each night and even brought it home with me. I have never carried Visine in my life, but there I was using it every half-hour.
Then there's the water and soil. On the west side of the valley, water is scarcer, and hundreds of thousands of acres can't be farmed because of salt buildups (the land is naturally salty) and selenium from irrigation drainwater. Tulare Lake, which was once the biggest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi, was drained long ago; now there's barely a trace of it. The San Joaquin River, the second longest within California and once among the best salmon-fishing rivers in the country, was dammed in the '40s and essentially drained for irrigation, 60 miles of a once-beautiful river run dry. (The Natural Resources Defense Council won a lawsuit that is re-establishing the flow of the San Joaquin.)
Then there's the toxic waste, meth labs and rampant unemployment, which is above 30 percent in some towns. One, Corcoran, bills itself as the ''farm capital of the world,'' but it's actually the ''famous-prisoner capital of the world.'' Charles Manson and Juan Corona -- a schizophrenic who was convicted of murdering at least 25 farmworkers in 1971 -- are both there. (Until recently, so was Sirhan Sirhan.) Low wages are compounded by wage theft and correspondingly high poverty levels. Fresno, Modesto and Bakersfield are three of the five poorest cities in the United States. The valley suffers from this, but it can be blamed for it in part, too.
This, and not the verdant hills of a Green Giant commercial, is where our food comes from. Part of the reason is the size and scope of production. Bolthouse farms and manages 60,000 acres, or more than four Manhattans, annually. Though nearly 15 percent of its production is organic, there is no way an operation of that size can avoid chemical fertilizers and pesticides. But the industrial farms don't have a monopoly on doing damage to the land. One day I visited the most unindustrial operation imaginable, a four-acre farm run by May Vu, a Hmong immigrant and former nurse. The valley is home to countless individual farmers like her who work a few acres in marginal land in and around Fresno, much of which was slated for development before the crash. Now it can be rented for around $400 an acre a year.
Vu grows what she believes she can sell locally. (The Hmong population is about 6 percent of that of Fresno, and a visit to a Hmong supermarket is breathtaking.) This includes squash (a kind that lasts for years on the shelf), several varieties of basil, tomatoes, herbs that I can't possibly recognize, okra, a few different eggplants, green beans, daikon, cabbages, cilantro, onion, long beans, chard, zinnia, sunflower, squash and more. This is post-green-revolution farming as it happens in much of the Third World, and there is something to be said for the independence it affords. But on farms like these, almost no one gives much thought to sustainability. It's too time-consuming; the primary goal is not sustaining the land but sustaining themselves. (Vu works seven 10-hour days a week.) It's also historically true that renters -- especially those who move from plot to plot every half-dozen years as the Hmong do there -- are bound to the land in general but have no ownership of any particular piece. Their mind-set is often to get as much as you can out of the land this year and don't worry about the next decade.
There must be, I thought (or fantasized) as I traveled through the valley, some movement toward pushing farmers, big and small, to produce decent food sustainably. Because if there's not, the valley's problems will only worsen, and we'd be complicit in destroying one of the country's greatest resources, one that has served us amazingly well until now. Indeed, I found a number of large farmers experimenting with sustainability and scale. John Diener's 4,500-acre Red Rock Ranch, in the west valley town of Five Points, uses mostly so-called conventional methods, but does so in creative and intelligent ways. Over all, his vision of big farming -- minimizing chemical application, for example, and reducing tillage (turning over or otherwise disturbing the soil) -- may point a way toward a future in which big-time farming can become more sustainable. Diener has also already instituted a system of mining (and even selling) minerals that he extracts -- via a series of tiles under his farmland -- after irrigation. This keeps local businesses from having to purchase minerals mined in more destructive ways.
Likewise, Keith Gardiner, the principal owner of Pacific Ag Management, farms about 10,000 acres of almond groves using plenty of conventional techniques. But the company is experimenting with solar energy to pump water and trying to reduce chemicals through an integrated pest management system. It was almond-harvest time when I visited Pacific Ag. In one field, Gardiner and Holly King, whose family land is farmed by the company, showed me a shaker, a squat four-wheel vehicle with a robotic arm that grabs the trunk of a tree and shakes it until the nuts fall to the ground. There they sit, drying for a week or so (the chances of rain are almost nil), until a sweeper comes along and gathers them. This is followed by a harvester, which scoops them into trucks that bring them to be hulled and shelled. The result is dozens of towering hills of almonds waiting to be processed and a small but growing mountain of shells.
It's not labor-free, but it's pretty easy compared with growing tomatoes or broccoli. And along with the fact that almond trees go for 25 years, it explains why so many valley farmers are turning to nuts. A decade ago, many analysts thought that the crop had reached its peak of one billion pounds. This year the harvest is something like two billion pounds, and farmers are still ripping out other crops and planting almonds. They're selling, too, if not here, then in China. The same is also true of grapes, which are feeding China's growing and extraordinary thirst for wine.
All of this made me wonder what, if anything, big farmers owe a society -- not only in terms of what they do to their land but in terms of what they actually grow. The food that's grown in the valley may be copious, but it's not necessarily all that good. The fruits and vegetables at my breakfast buffet in Glendale were pretty much the same as the stuff I bought two weeks ago at a supermarket on Broadway. And though I ate well on my trip, I tasted plenty of produce that was grown to withstand a couple of weeks in transit and on the shelf.
Do we have a right to expect tomatoes that taste like tomatoes and to have them grown in sustainably? It might sound like a ridiculous question. These are for-profit enterprises operating on private land and dealing with the difficulties of distribution and the vagaries of the market. But it's not so outlandish to think we should have some collective say in what is farmed and how. After all, between 1862 and 1934, the Homestead Act transferred 10 percent of all land in the United States from federal to private control, and it's federal money that pays for much of the roads and irrigation systems that make farming in the valley so profitable.
I badly wanted to visit Tom and Denesse Willey in Madera, 25 miles northwest of Fresno. I'd met them over dinner at Mark Arax's house at the outset of my trip. (Denesse's plum cake was the best I've ever had.) The Willeys represent another part of valley culture that usually gets little credit: making a sizable organic farm work, with few compromises. It's true that 75 acres is small by Central Valley standards, but their model is important and their impact large: they have 800 families in their C.S.A., or community-supported agriculture, program, some of whom live 60 miles away. They have a largely year-round, full-time staff of 60, all of whom can qualify for vacations and a bonus pool. The Willeys farm 40 crops on their land, with a four-season rotation and customers from the Pacific to the Mississippi.
There are people who will tell you that the valley is all food production and no food culture, but that's not true at the Willeys' farm, where varieties are chosen for flavor and color -- the overall look of the place is dazzling, almost psychedelic -- as well as hardiness and productivity. When I arrived, Tom was struggling with a basil problem that showed me just how seriously he takes his produce. Basil is a huge crop for the farm -- at four acres, it might be the biggest basil patch in the country -- and downy mildew had attacked the crop. There were two 25-gallon garbage barrels of basil ready to be recycled. The bright green leaves looked gorgeous to me, but Willey deemed them unfit for sale.
We took a golf-cart ride in the afternoon heat, during which I admired Willey's tomatoes (6 acres), potatoes (25, in two crops), peppers (2), eggplant (4) and cool-weather crops like lettuce and artichokes. T & D Willey Farms is different from the valley's largest operations in four important ways. First, the farm averages nearly one worker per acre, a remarkable rate by industrial standards. Second, unlike other farms, their rotation allows them to offer year-round work. Third, the farm's land is replenished at or near the rate that it's being exploited. Perhaps most important are his superior crops. Though I arrived late in the season, I tasted Willey's tomatoes and eggplant, and they did for me what all the best California produce does: they made me want to farm. Or at least garden -- but definitely in California.
The Willeys are pioneers in the organic (and fair) farm movement, and Tom is as articulate and committed a representative of it as I've found. He's unshakable in his belief in organic farming, though ''we're all pioneers,'' he reminded me. ''For 95 percent of history, we were hunter-gatherers. There's no reason to assume that agriculture of any kind will be successful in the long run.''
Willey argues frequently with his friend Paul Buxman, who lives about 50 miles southeast, in Dinuba, and who has become gradually disillusioned with organics. After stints as a painter and a teacher, Buxman bought a majority of his 58-acre family farm from his father 30 years ago and went broke almost immediately. He survived, incredibly, by selling art, and now he is one of the best tree-fruit growers in the state. Part of the land he purchased had been contaminated by a once-popular soil-treatment chemical known as DBCP that was believed to double grape yields. That is, until it was shown to cause sterility and maybe worse. Health officials told Buxman that not only should he not use his groundwater on his crops but also that his family shouldn't wash in it, cook with it or breathe near it. Buxman's 32-year-old son, Wyeth, came down with leukemia when he was 3. Buxman became an organic farmer immediately.
But after a few years, Buxman came to believe that nonorganic chemicals can target problems more precisely and more accurately than organic ones and that it was time to leave ''organic'' behind. ''An organic pesticide is still poisonous,'' he told me, over his fabulous biscuits, served with his (ditto) apricot jam.
There is, it's true, a spirit and letter of what's organic. What Tom and Denesse Willey do is organic in every sense of the word, but they're the exception. When consumers buy organic, they are guaranteed little more than food that is (in theory at least) produced without synthetic chemicals or G.M.O.'s (genetically modified organisms), and with some attention (again, in theory) to the health of the soil. They're not guaranteed fair treatment of laborers. They are not guaranteed a minimized carbon footprint or anything approaching local. (Organic vegetables, as you probably know, may come from China.) Nor, for that matter, are they guaranteed anything that tastes good.
''The public is tired of corporate food,'' Buxman said. ''But the word 'organic' has been misused and usurped.'' Instead, Buxman devised a rating system called California Clean, which would allow for chemical fertilizers but exclude farms of more than 100 acres and require the farmer and his or her family to be the primary laborers. It would also require that produce be of high quality, with high nutrition, and would require that the farms had an active biology, including healthy soil, birds, worms and so on.
It hasn't caught on, and it may be imperfect, but Buxman's idea of splitting the difference between ''organic'' and ''conventional'' seems to me to point the way forward to a place beyond a simplistic label like ''organic.'' Big farmers can be encouraged and taught -- and perhaps incentivized -- to use fewer and more precise pesticides, to reduce tillage and water use, to evaluate soil not only based on output but on health. The biggest beneficiary, of course, is the land, but the health of workers, animals, the environment and consumers are all important considerations as well. And in the valley right now, not much attention has been paid to them.
No matter what, though, it seems as if the valley is eventually going to become less productive. In fact, that's already happening. Development and contamination have taken land out of production. And disproportionate swaths are being devoted to grape and almond farming solely because those crops can be reliably processed and profitably shipped to China. There are pioneers in the valley, people working to figure out ways to make their style of farming -- whether big or small -- work over the long term. But beyond the profit motive, there is little public support or encouragement for them or their ideas and no way for consumers or even officials to know whom to support. As a result, our land use and, to a considerable extent, our diet are dependent on the hunches and whims of landowners. If we want a system of farming that's sustainable on all levels, we have to think about a national food and farming policy. And as I was looking out at Buxman's amazing land, it occurred to me just how amazing it is that we don't have one.
Recipe: ; Mark Arax's Marinated Lamb
4 lamb-leg steaks, 6 to 8 ounces each
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, preferably aged 15 years or more
4 tablespoons chopped rosemary
1. Place steaks in a nonreactive baking dish. Rub each steak with ¼ teaspoon kosher salt, ¼ teaspoon black pepper and a shy ¼ teaspoon garlic powder. Drizzle each steak with 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar. Then sprinkle 1 tablespoon rosemary over each steak on both sides. Rub the spices, olive oil, vinegar and rosemary all over the meat. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
2. Remove the lamb from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking. Heat a grill until very hot. Grill steaks for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Let rest for a few minutes before slicing thinly on the diagonal. Serve immediately.
Yield:
Recipe: ; Denesse Willey's Fresh Plum Cake
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole-wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon table salt
3/4 cup granulated sugar
12 tablespoons cold butter
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla
About 6 ounces milk
5 to 6 plums, sliced
1/2 cup old-fashioned oatmeal
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Lightly grease an 9-inch-by 13-inch baking pan. In the bowl of a food processor, combine flours, baking powder, salt and 1/4 cup sugar. Add 6 tablespoons cold butter and pulse until it is the consistency of corn meal. In a measuring cup, beat together the eggs and vanilla; add enough milk to make 1 cup. With the processor running, pour in milk mixture; a soft sticky dough will form. Scrape the dough into the pan, and with a greased spatula press the dough to cover the bottom of the pan. Press in the fruit, skin side down until it uniformly covers the dough. (Distribute the dough more evenly by pushing it with the fruit sections.) Sprinkle oatmeal over all. Distribute 1/2 cup sugar over the oatmeal. Sprinkle on spices. Dot with remaining 6 tablespoons cold butter.
2. Bake about 25 minutes. Serve warm (but not hot) with ice cream for dessert. Refrigerate leftovers for breakfast.
Yield:
Recipe: ; Paul Buxman's Biscuits
1/3 cup stone-ground whole-wheat pastry flour
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
Generous 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/3 cup frozen unsalted butter
1 1/4 cups buttermilk
1. Preheat oven to 500 degree. In a large bowl, mix dry ingredients, cut butter into small chips adding into the mix. Use a pastry cutter to incorporate butter into flour until mixture becomes mealy. Create a small indentation in center of mix and add buttermilk. Fold dry mix into wet center with wooden spoon until dough ball is formed.
2. Transfer dough to work surface that has been floured with mix of wholewheat flour and all-purpose flour. Press dough into a flattened round and fold over; flatten again and fold, then flatten and fold the dough once more. With palm of hand, press dough to 1/2-inch thickness. (Do not use a rolling pin -- biscuits will not rise properly.)
3. Cut out biscuits with sharp biscuit cutter into 2 1/4-inch rounds, if possible. (Make sure the cutter is sharp. A dull one seals the dough around the edges, and the biscuit will not rise properly). Place biscuits on baking tray 2 inches apart and place in upper third of the oven.
4. Bake for 3 minutes, then reduce the heat to 450 degrees and bake for 7 minutes or until golden brown. Place the biscuits in a basket with a paper towel on the bottom, and cover with a kitchen towel (don't wrap them in the towel).
5. Preslice chilled butter to serve with biscuits. It saves time as biscuits are passed around table.
Yield: 12-14 biscuits

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH

 BODY:
IT might be possible to write a novel more unfilmable than David Mitchell's ''Cloud Atlas,'' but you would have to work at it.
''Cloud Atlas,'' which was published to great critical acclaim and shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize in 2004, is really six interlocking novellas nestled inside one another. In chronological order, there are the stories of a 19th-century American notary traveling home by ship from Australia; a young bisexual British composer who is an amanuensis to an elderly musician (modeled on Delius) in Flanders, Belgium, in the 1930s; a muckraking journalist investigating a sinister energy company in 1970s California; a cheesy book publisher imprisoned in a rest home in contemporary London; a genetically engineered Korean restaurant worker in 2144; and a goatherd living in Hawaii, or what used to be Hawaii, in a postapocalyptic future. But the novel doesn't unfold chronologically. Except for the goatherd's story, which remains in the center, like a hub, the other narratives are interrupted halfway through and then pick up again in reverse order, so that the book rewinds itself like a palindrome. And oh, yes, for good measure the goatherd's narrative is written in a kind of pidgin English that the author invented just for the occasion. 
Mr. Mitchell has written four other novels, including one, ''Black Swan Green,'' that couldn't be more straightforward and traditional. All of them have been optioned for the movies, though as he pointed out recently, ''they have yet to stagger out of development hell.'' His only book that has made it to the screen is what he called ''the most unfilmable one''; the movie version of ''Cloud Atlas,'' written and directed by Tom Tykwer (who also wrote the music) and the siblings Lana and Andy Wachowski, and starring Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and Hugh Grant (who, like many of the other actors, each play six parts), opens on Oct. 26. ''In all honesty, I'm amazed that of all my books, this is the one that filmmakers of that caliber and reputation would want to make,'' Mr. Mitchell said on the phone from Ireland, where he lives.
Mr. Wachowski, in New York this month, said: ''We actually weren't sure it could be done. We were skeptical going into the writing process. That was a sort of exploration, just to see if it was even possible.''
A lot of skeptics are waiting to see the same thing. The Wachowskis, whose three ''Matrix'' movies earned well over a billion dollars worldwide, used to have tremendous credibility in Hollywood, but their most recent movie, ''Speed Racer,'' was a big-budget dud, and not everyone who read the ''Cloud Atlas'' script was convinced that audiences would spend close to three hours trying to follow it. The project came about because the Wachowskis and Mr. Tykwer, close friends, were looking for something complicated enough that they could work on it together. In 2005, on the set of ''V for Vendetta,'' which the Wachowskis wrote and produced, Ms. Wachowski heard about ''Cloud Atlas'' from Natalie Portman, one of that film's stars. Ms. Wachowski read it and gave it to her brother, and then they urged Mr. Tykwer to take a look.
Who better, if you think about it? Mr. Tykwer, 47, a German filmmaker, is probably best known for ''Run Lola Run,'' a movie that doesn't tell multiple stories, exactly, but rather the same story, with subtle variations, over and over again. The Wachowskis (she is 47; he, 44), in the ''Matrix'' movies, posit that reality itself is just a story.
Squeezed around a hotel coffee table in New York, they could have been characters in each other's films. Mr. Tykwer is wiry, intense and intellectual. Lana Wachowski, who until 2002 was Larry Wachowski and now has a mop of red, Raggedy Ann dreadlocks, is earnest and thoughtful. Her brother, Andy, is blunt and down to earth. With his broad frame and large shaved head, you could mistake him for a bouncer in a Russian bar.
From the beginning the filmmakers ruled out the idea of telling the novel's six stories sequentially. They didn't think audiences would sit still for it. ''Try to imagine, you're sitting there in the theater for 90 minutes, and then a whole new story starts,'' Ms. Wachowski said, shaking her head. So instead they broke the novel down into hundreds of scenes, transcribed them onto color-coded index cards and shuffled them around, looking for patterns and parallels and a way to splice them together. Eventually they began to see certain similarities between characters in the different narratives and hit upon the movie's most distinctive feature: having a single actor play multiple roles.
In effect they took what is a relatively minor motif in the novel -- the idea of eternal recurrence -- and turned it into a major one. They also laid on top of it a plot of moral or karmic progression, so that Mr. Hanks, the lead, goes from being the movie's worst character, a doctor trying to poison the 19th-century notary, to its best, the futuristic goatherd, Zachry, who saves humanity, or what remains of it. Mr. Grant, on the other hand, goes in the opposite direction, starting out bad as a racist missionary in the 19th-century story and winding up worse as a slobbering cannibal in the postapocalyptic one. Some actors even play members of the opposite sex.
''In a way all of our movies are about interconnectivity and about truth beneath the surface,'' Ms. Wachowski said. ''There are parts of me and parts of Andy in all of them, and now there are parts of Tom. A constant theme is the transformational and transcendental power of love.'' She turned to her collaborators and added, ''Their acceptance of me has certainly been transformational in my own life.''
Strictly speaking, the filmmakers were under no obligation to seek Mr. Mitchell's approval. They had bought the rights and could do whatever they liked. But after Alan Moore, the author of the graphic novel on which ''V for Vendetta'' is based, complained bitterly about that movie, the Wachowskis determined not to make ''Cloud Atlas'' unless Mr. Mitchell gave his blessing.
Mr. Mitchell recalled that they met in a hotel in Cork, and then he and Ms. Wachowski spent a couple of hours in a pub over pints of Murphy's discussing narrative theory. ''I felt as if I'd been in a creative writing course,'' he said. Mr. Mitchell happily approved all their ideas, including such departures from the book as transporting part of the action to another planet. (Mr. Mitchell even has a cameo. Graduate students will one day write theses about his presence at the execution of one of his characters.) ''I felt that if it's in the spirit of the book and works for the film, then go for it,'' he said, adding: ''The way the characters evolve is sort of like 'Pilgrim's Progress.' That's how I like to think of it. It's a matrix -- no pun intended -- of 'Pilgrim's Progress.' ''
Another early reader of the script was Mr. Hanks, who declared it ''bodacious.''
''Screenplays often really lay it all out for you, but this was like the blueprint for some complicated piece of architecture,'' Mr. Hanks said. ''They voluntarily made a dense, complicated screenplay in which nothing seems to make any sense, and then the scenes start to match up. It was a clean, pure, artistic enterprise.''
Very few studio executives shared Mr. Hanks's enthusiasm. They were put off by the multiple narratives, with their different tones and different themes, Ms. Wachowski explained. ''In movies now there's this rigidity of concept,'' she said. ''And it's enforced by a lot of the people who talk about movies. In a serious movie you can't have comedy, and if there's romance in there, you can't be philosophical.''
So ''Cloud Atlas,'' with a budget that reached $100 million and distribution by Warner Brothers, had to be financed independently through private investors, many in Asia. As Mr. Wachowski pointed out, a little sardonically, ''Sometimes the making of the movie was more interesting than the story of the movie itself.'' Backers kept dropping in and then dropping out, even after contracts had been signed, forcing the filmmakers to keep whittling the budget.
''It was a constant beating down,'' Mr. Tykwer said. ''A couple of times the movie fell apart even as we were shooting it.''
Mr. Hanks said that ''the way the industry works now, they don't give money for independent films like this.'' He went on: ''The Wachowskis sank a lot of their own money into it. They were like Walt Disney mortgaging the house to make 'Snow White.' ''
He laughed and added: ''They should have sold it as a sequel. Call it 'Cloud Atlas II,' and you can have all the money you want.''
For reasons of logistics and economy, much of the film was shot on adjoining soundstages at the Babelsberg studio, near Berlin. Mr. Tykwer supervised the composer's sequence, the journalist's story and that of the publisher trapped in the rest home. The Wachowskis took the shipboard narrative and, no surprise, the two futuristic ones. But all three filmmakers, who believe strongly in the collaborative, social nature of filmmaking, insisted that they were in constant communication and worked together on everything.
The actors, meanwhile, found themselves walking between sets, playing different roles in different centuries, sometimes on the same day. ''You'd get to the set in the morning, and it was like, 'Who am I today?' '' Mr. Hanks said, adding that he particularly enjoyed all the prostheses -- false teeth and cauliflower ears -- he got to wear. ''The process of coming up with all the characters was long and physical,'' he said, ''but the actual playing was as much fun as being in a repertory company.''
Talking about the Wachowskis' way of working, he said: ''What you have to realize is that they have been talking in their own secret language for years prior to the set. Lana lines up the shots, and Andy says, 'Sounds good to me,' or 'Let's give it a shot; let's do this thing.' We would shoot a lot, talk a lot, shoot some more. They were always massaging it verbally and physically, but they never double-teamed you.''
On the other hand, with Mr. Tykwer, Mr. Hanks said, ''the whole process was: 'Let's be on the same page going into this.' So you'd get to the set, talk for an hour, an hour and a half, then shoot, and then you'd be done. I remember thinking, 'Am I doing something wrong here?' ''
But in almost no time, Mr. Hanks added, the process of crossing over from set to set, character to character, century to century, director to director became second nature. ''They're gentle souls,'' he said of all three filmmakers. ''It was extremely challenging in every way, shape and form. They should have been panicked, but there was no panic.''

HEADLINE: China Exports Rise, Hinting at a Glimmer of Revival

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Hilda Wang contributed reporting.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China's exports to the United States and Southeast Asia rose last month while the country's money supply expanded faster than expected, Chinese government agencies said on Saturday, in the first signs that the Chinese economy might be starting to bottom out.
But strengthening exports to the United States -- up 5.5 percent in September compared with the same month a year ago -- could also increase trade frictions at a politically touchy time for both countries. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, and President Obama have competed this autumn to present themselves as more willing to confront China on trade issues. 
China's own Communist Party leadership has been wary of appearing too conciliatory toward the United States ahead of their Party Congress, which starts two days after the presidential election in the United States on Nov. 6 and is expected to produce a new slate of members of the ruling Standing Committee of the Politburo.
After months of gloom, Chinese exporters are starting to voice hope about demand in the United States.
''We are beginning to see some improvement in the U.S. market -- the second half of this year is looking better than the first half, with our U.S. orders up by roughly 8 to 10 percent,'' said Dora Zhao, the sales manager at the Zhuhai Xiangrui Safety Home Appliance Company, which manufactures air purifiers in Zhuhai, in southeastern China.
Rising imports often coincide with a strengthening economy, as more prosperous and confident consumers buy more foreign goods. By that measure, the United States economy may be faring better, but the European Union is struggling -- China's exports to Europe dropped 10.7 percent last month from a year ago.
Strong Chinese exports to the United States in September also tend to be a sign that American retailers expect fairly robust sales at Christmas, as goods for late autumn sales tend to leave Chinese docks in September and October.
China has exported more to the United States than to the European Union every month since February, and September showed the biggest gap yet between the two markets, data from China's General Administration of Customs showed. By contrast, the European Union had bought more Chinese goods than the United States every month for the preceding four and a half years.
China's exports to all countries rose 9.9 percent in September from a year earlier, led by especially strong exports to Southeast Asia. Imports rose 2.4 percent, after shrinking in August.
Sun Junwei, a China economist at HSBC, wrote in a research note, ''The stronger than expected rebound of September exports growth is helpful to alleviate concerns of a sharper slowdown'' of the Chinese economy.
But she noted that the increase in imports mostly consisted of goods needed by export industries, suggesting that domestic demand in China remained weak.
The composition of Chinese exports to all countries continued to shift toward higher-value products, with China posting sharp increases in exports of consumer electronics, electric motors and steel. Economists had anticipated some increase in Chinese exports last month as Apple began importing huge quantities of the iPhone 5 to the United States.
China's central bank announced separately that the country's broadly measured money supply grew 14.8 percent in September from a year earlier, higher than the 13.7 percent expected. The growth is an indication that the government is starting to have at least some success in relieving a credit squeeze that has hurt many businesses.

HEADLINE: An Irish Catholic Wake-Up

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
NOW you know what Thanksgiving with my family is like.
A donnybrook with Irish Catholic uncles and nephews interrupting one another, mocking one another, arguing over one another, bombastically denouncing every political opinion except their own as malarkey.
The loser of the vice-presidential debate was, of course, Barack Obama. In contrast to the pair on the undercard slugging it out, the president's limp performance the other night was even more inexplicable and inexcusable. The president was no doubt warned not to sigh, but his entire demeanor was a sigh.
The fact that one diffident debate by the president could throw his whole race into crisis shows that nobody madly loves Obama anymore. With his aloof presidency, he shook off the deep attachments from 2008, and now his support lacks intensity.
Even if he comes out in the town-hall debate on Tuesday with Ben Affleck charm, he has a Mitt Romney problem. Will it be the real Obama or will he just be doing what the media suggest and the base demands? 
In Thursday night's hockey game of a debate, the odd semiotics were not Gore-y sighs but grins. It's hard to imagine a politician getting penalized for smiling too much, but Joe Biden managed it, breaking out in smiles and laughter 92 times by the count of ABC News. Ever since Obama tapped him, Biden has felt that his role is to warm up Barry's Brother From Another Planet affect. In this debate, making up for his boss's Spockiness was critically important, so Biden overcompensated with a volcano of verbosity and gesticulating.
Biden was trying to do what Romney did well: come across as a senior partner chastising a junior associate who screwed up. For this vice president, though, less is never more. He mugged condescension as if he were the star of a silent movie. But who ever accused Uncle Joe of subtlety?
Not Sarah Palin, who told Fox News that Biden reminded her of ''watching a musk ox run across the tundra with somebody underfoot.''
Still, in a political world where most leaders are so marketed and poll-tested that they show little temperament, why begrudge Joltin' Joe an excess of it -- especially when he's confronted with such whoppers? Besides, he offered a tour de force on facts that brought the playing field to life again.
Ryan, who was a toddler when Biden first came to the Senate, seemed a little green and shaky at moments -- not showing the goofy cockiness captured in Time's photos of his dumbbell workouts. Talking budget blarney, the Tea Party's boy wonder once more proved that he can come up with a number for any purpose.
Ryan explained Romney's embarrassing secret tape to fat cats with this snide put-down to Joe, as he chummily called his elder: ''I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way.''
Biden shot back: ''But I always say what I mean.''
If Obama needed Biden on the ticket to add a little humanity, Romney needed Ryan as ''a modular conviction unit,'' as one Obama adviser joked. Romney, a say-anything salesman used to buying whatever he wants, hired his ideology.
Ryan is a true believer, and that's a little awkward now that Romney is making strides by showing that he truly believes nothing -- running away from, rather than toward, the hard-right stances that won him the nomination.
''Convictions aren't helpful at the moment,'' said David Axelrod, the Obama strategist. ''The game right now is to try to obfuscate. Romney's audacity in the debate was in hiding their plans. And Ryan actually believes this stuff. He argued for a Social Security privatization plan so radical that even the Bush administration called it irresponsible.''
The 42-year-old Wisconsin congressman kept gulping water, and once, when Biden nailed Ryan for twice soliciting the very stimulus money he condemns, he may have actually gulped. Unlike Palin, who also had to cram before her debate, Ryan did not need to memorize chunks. He actually tried to learn about all the parts of the world he had never followed closely. On Afghanistan, he spouted so many obscure geographical references, from Zabul to Kunar to the treacherous eastern provinces, he sounded like Google maps.
Ryan had intensive coaching from Dan Senor, the senior adviser, to debate Biden, the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But he still clearly knew far less about the globe than both Biden and the moderator, Martha Raddatz, ABC News's senior foreign affairs correspondent.
(I knew Raddatz would be tough because I once saw her dress down a male clerk at a Marriott hotel in Saudi Arabia who told her that women were not allowed to use the gym.)
Ryan ended up simply parroting Senor, who made his name as spokesman for the botched Iraq occupation. That's a scary thing unless you want to go back to the messianic mind-set of imprinting our ''values'' in the Islamic world, an attitude that brought us interminable wars and trillion-dollar deficits.
Ryan echoed the bankrupt neocon philosophy of going to war to prevent war. With Iran, he said, the best thing to do is threaten war. ''The key is to do this peacefully,'' he said, sounding as woolly as Paul Wolfowitz. Ryan didn't seem to understand what much of the world does: The administration has worked with allies to strengthen sanctions, which have turned Iran into an economic basket case.
Biden also boxed Ryan into looking as though he wants to send more American troops to Afghanistan and to intervene in Syria, which isn't so appealing to war-weary America.
Ronald Reagan knew how to bluster for peace. Neocons do not. When they run the show, threatening a war is followed by going to war and that is followed by bollixing up the war and that is followed by our troops' dying at war and money-pit nation-building to end the war, and that is followed by economic disaster for America.
Amped to make up for all of Obama's missed shots, Biden went on a one-minute scream-of-consciousness about the 47 percent cited by Romney as moochers, the 30 percent cited by Ryan as takers, Scranton, his parents, the Buffett rule, Social Security, veterans, the 47 percent again, Grover Norquist, the middle class, a fair shot, Wall Street vs. Main street, and $500 billion in additional tax cuts for 120,000 wealthy families. Practically in one breath. Whew.
Biden's weakest moment was on Libya, where he stumbled as he claimed that the White House didn't know about requests for more security for diplomats there. It is likely true that such an appeal never made it through the Foggy Bottom bureaucracy to the West Wing. But the vice president should have been prepared to answer questions about a blunder that has scuffed the administration's national security luster.
Certainly, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been doing a good imitation of her predecessor James Baker in keeping a distance from trouble. On Friday, she finally spoke up.
''Diplomacy, by its nature, has to often be practiced in dangerous places,'' she said at a forum here. ''We will never prevent every act of violence or terrorism or achieve perfect security.''
The president's advisers now realize they will need a much better explanation by Tuesday, when Romney is certain to press Obama on the issue.
Mittens has been doing better with women since the first debate. Raddatz didn't dwell on women's issues, which denied Biden a chance to home in on Ryan's chillingly retro positions.
Ryan, who has long opposed abortion even in cases of rape and incest, said, ''The policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortion with the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.''
When Raddatz asked Ryan if those who believe abortion should remain legal should be worried if the Republican team wins, Ryan basically said yes.
''We don't think that unelected judges should make this decision,'' he said, though he and other Republicans for decades have pined for a Supreme Court that would overturn Roe v. Wade. He added, ''People, through their elected representatives and reaching a consensus in society through the democratic process, should make this determination.''
Biden, for once, wasn't smiling.

 BODY:
After more than a decade of having American blood spilled in Afghanistan, with nearly six years lost to President George W. Bush's disastrous indifference, it is time for United States forces to leave Afghanistan on a schedule dictated only by the security of the troops. It should not take more than a year. The United States will not achieve even President Obama's narrowing goals, and prolonging the war will only do more harm.
Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. said on Friday that ''we are leaving Afghanistan in 2014, period. There is no ifs, ands or buts.'' Mr. Obama indicated earlier that this could mean the end of 2014. Either way, two more years of combat, two more years of sending the 1 percent of Americans serving in uniform to die and be wounded, is too long.
Administration officials say they will not consider a secure ''logistical withdrawal,'' but they offer no hope of achieving broad governance and security goals. And the only final mission we know of, to provide security for a 2014 Afghan election, seems dubious at best and more likely will only lend American approval to a thoroughly corrupt political system. 
*
This conclusion represents a change on our part. The war in Afghanistan had powerful support at the outset, including ours, after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
After Mr. Bush's years of neglect, we believed that a new president, Barack Obama, was doing the right thing by at least making an effort. He set goals that made sense: first, a counterinsurgency campaign, stepped-up attacks on Al Qaeda, then an attempt to demolish the Taliban's military power, promote democratic governance in Kabul and build an Afghan Army capable of exerting control over the country.
But it is now clear that if there ever was a chance of ''victory'' in Afghanistan, it evaporated when American troops went off to fight the pointless war in Iraq. While some progress has been made, the idea of fully realizing broader democratic and security aims simply grows more elusive. Meanwhile, more than 2,000 American troops have died in this war, more than 50 of them recently in growing attacks by Afghan forces, and many thousands more have been maimed. The war has now cost upward of $500 billion.
Representative Paul Ryan, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, said at the debate on Thursday: ''We don't want to lose the gains we've gotten. We want to make sure that the Taliban doesn't come back in.''
More fighting will not consolidate the modest gains made by this war, and there seems little chance of guaranteeing that the Taliban do not ''come back in,'' at least in the provinces where they have never truly been dislodged. Last month, militants struck a heavily fortified NATO base. Officials say the Pakistan-based Haqqani network is behind many of the attacks on Americans.
Americans are desperate to see the war end and the 68,000 remaining troops come home. President Obama has not tasked military commanders with recommending a pace for the withdrawal until after the election. He and the coalition partners have committed to remain engaged in Afghanistan after 2014 at reduced levels, which could involve 15,000 or more American troops to carry out specialized training and special operations. Mr. Obama, or Mitt Romney if he wins, will have a hard time convincing Americans that makes sense -- let alone Afghans. The military may yet ask for tens of thousands more troops, which would be a serious mistake.
To increase the odds for a more manageable transition and avert an economic collapse, the United States and other major donors have pledged $16 billion in economic aid through 2015. That is a commitment worth keeping, but the United States and its allies have tried nation building in Afghanistan, at least for the last four years. It is not working.

The task is to pack up without leaving behind arms that terrorists want and cannot easily find elsewhere (like Stinger missiles) or high-tech equipment (like Predator drones) that can be reverse engineered by Pakistan or other potential foes. The military can blow those things up if it must.
It is hard to be exact about a timetable since the Pentagon and NATO refuse to discuss it. The secretary of defense, Leon Panetta, told us last week that decisions about the timetable would be made after the military command reported to Mr. Obama in December. He would not say much of anything beyond that -- whether the withdrawal would be front-loaded, or back-loaded, or how many troops would be needed to secure the election.
Some experts say a secure withdrawal would take at least six months, and possibly a year. But one year is a huge improvement over two. It would be one less year of having soldiers die or come home with wounds that are terrifying, physically and mentally.
Suicides among veterans and those in active service reached unacceptable levels long ago. A recent article by The Associated Press quoted studies estimating that 45 percent of returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan are claiming disability benefits. A quarter of those veterans -- 300,000 to 400,000, depending on the study -- say they suffer from some form of post-traumatic stress disorder. This is far too high a price to go on asking of troops and their families.
Four years ago, Mr. Obama called Afghanistan a ''war we have to win.'' His strategy relied on a newly trained Afghan Army and police force that could take over fighting the Taliban; a government competent to deliver basic services; and Pakistan's cooperation. Here is what happened:
AFGHAN SECURITY FORCES NATO and the Pentagon built an Afghan Army and police force of nearly 352,000 that is now nominally in the lead for providing security in most of the country. Attrition rates are high and morale is low; the attacks on coalition forces have eroded trust and slowed the training. Afghan leaders have to work harder with Washington to weed out corrupt troops and Taliban infiltrators, but the nation cannot hang its hopes on that happening.
There is an agreement to finance the army to 2017 with Kabul paying $500 million, Washington about $2.5 billion and other donors about $1.3 billion. If Kabul keeps its commitments, the donors should make good on theirs.
The Taliban have not retaken territory they lost to coalition forces, but Kandahar and Helmand Provinces, the Taliban base and the main focus of the 2010 surge, remain heavily contested. A Pentagon report in May said Taliban attacks in Kandahar from last October through March rose by 13 percent over the same period a year earlier.
William Byrd, an Afghan expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said, ''The most that probably can be hoped'' is that the army continues to hold Kabul and other major cities. It is not likely to ever become an effective counterinsurgency force.
EFFECTIVE, CREDIBLE GOVERNANCE President Hamid Karzai's weak and corrupt government, awash in billions of dollars, continues to alienate Afghans and make the Taliban an attractive alternative. Mr. Karzai recently chose Asadullah Khalid, a man accused of torture and drug trafficking, to take over the country's main intelligence agency. Dozens of Karzai family members and allies have taken government jobs, pursued business interests or worked as contractors to the United States government.
A recent report by Afghanistan's central bank said the Afghan political elite had been using Kabul Bank as a piggy bank. In 2010, word that the bank had lost $300 million caused a panic, and the number later tripled. To win pledges of continued aid at an international donors conference in July, President Karzai promised to crack down on corruption and make political reforms, but he has done little. The aid sustaining his government is at risk if he fails. We doubt that he will exercise real leadership. For now, he has proved himself to be not only unreliable, but a force undermining American goals and Afghans' interests.
In 2009 and 2010, Mr. Karzai's supporters tried to defraud the national elections. With elections scheduled for 2014, the question is whether Mr. Karzai will keep his vow to abide by the Constitution and leave when his term is up. He needs to make sure the Parliament and the government put in place an electoral system that encourages competent candidates to run and enables a broadly accepted election with international monitors. All sides are lagging. (There has been even less progress in restoring local governance, the bedrock of Afghan society, where the Taliban exert enduring influence.)
Mr. Obama wants to use American troops to provide logistical assistance and security at the elections. There were real threats to voters' lives in the first post-Taliban elections, but the real threat to democracy is from corruption, not bombs. Mr. Karzai stole the last election, and he got away with it with American forces in place. After giving him 10 years and lots of money, things keep going in the wrong direction. Why would this now change?
RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN After some bitter disputes, Pakistan began cooperating with the United States again in June by reopening a critical supply route to Afghanistan. American officials say the Pakistanis may have decided that sowing chaos in Afghanistan by supporting Taliban proxies is not in their interest after all. This could be wishful thinking. Last week, the Pentagon blamed the Pakistani-backed Haqqani network for some of the recent ''green on blue'' attacks. Islamabad's collusion with the Taliban and other extremist groups is the biggest threat to Afghan stability.
The United States has a huge interest in a less destructive Pakistan, a nuclear-armed country of 170 million that supports jihad in Afghanistan, Kashmir and Indian cities. But there is reason to argue that America's leverage with Pakistan on security matters is limited by its need for Pakistani bases, border crossings and intelligence on the Taliban.
If tens of thousands of American troops were removed from landlocked Afghanistan, that might actually allow the United States to hang tougher with Islamabad. Pakistan officials might not listen, but at least the United States could be more honest about what the Pakistanis were doing to worsen the threat of terrorism and insurgency.
*
We are not arguing that everything will work out well after the United States leaves Afghanistan. It will not. The Taliban will take over parts of the Pashtun south, where they will brutalize women and trample their rights. Warlords will go on stealing. Afghanistan will still be the world's second-poorest country. Al Qaeda may make inroads, but since 9/11 it has established itself in Yemen and many other countries.
America's global interests suffer when it is mired in unwinnable wars in distant regions. Dwight Eisenhower helped the country's position in the world by leaving Korea; Richard Nixon by leaving Vietnam; President Obama by leaving Iraq.
None of these places became Jeffersonian democracies. But the United States was better off for leaving. Post-American Afghanistan is likely to be more presentable than North Korea, less presentable than Iraq and perhaps about the same as Vietnam. But it fits the same pattern of damaging stalemate. We need to exit as soon as we safely can.

HEADLINE: That Blurry Line Between Makers and Takers

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
MITT ROMNEY has apologized for his depiction of 47 percent of America as wealth takers rather than wealth makers. But his blunder touched inadvertently on some discomforting truths about the importance of politics in income distribution in the United States.
If Mr. Romney's points were to be reformulated in a more defensible direction, the outline might look something like this: 
OF MAKING AND TAKING The correct distinction is not ''makers versus takers.'' The problem is that taking, rather than making wealth, appears to be growing in relative influence.
Most of us are actually both makers and takers. Consider farmers who produce food and favor agricultural subsidies. The question is whether the role of wealth maker has more influence over our politics, at any given time, than does the taker role. Is public policy being adjudicated on grounds of ethics and efficiency, or is the real story about lobbying and the relative power of different interest groups?
It isn't easy to measure whether politics is less public-spirited these days, and we should resist the tendency to idealize the past. Still, job creation, median income and other measures of economic well-being have done poorly since the late 1990s. That suggests that America isn't paying enough attention to creating wealth and increasing general prosperity.
FOLLOW THE MONEY Seven of the 10 most affluent counties in the nation are near Washington, D.C. That means a growing number of educated people are making a very good living advising, lobbying and otherwise influencing the federal government. This is a talent drain. It's far from obvious that we are getting better policy as a result, and true wealth creation has not kept pace.
As Matthew Yglesias, a columnist for the online magazine Slate, has pointed out, there is also a subtler point about those wealthy Virginia and Maryland counties. They have high per capita incomes, not only because they attract educated, government-oriented professionals, but also because their zoning and building codes limit the supply of low-cost housing. That's a significant government intervention that hurts lower-income people, who must pay more. Privilege-seeking through government is often most pernicious when it has a tidy front and a well-manicured green lawn.
UNEQUAL INFLUENCE Politics based on lobbying stacks the deck against lower-income groups, who are often outmaneuvered. For instance, one of the biggest problems faced by the poor today is inadequate K-12 education. They need improved public schools, more school choice, or some mix of both. Over time, such improvements would help deal with many other social and economic issues, including global competitiveness, domestic unemployment, public health and the budget deficit, because quality education has many beneficial effects.
Instead, the current system of transfers offers to the poor various sops in place of more effective reforms. Fundamental improvements to education would involve more challenging changes to residential zoning, teacher unions and certification systems, and might also take some educational finance and control out of the hands of local municipalities. It is no surprise that well-off families want to keep a system that has done very well by them, and that the poor often lose political battles over education.
EVERYONE FEELS ENTITLED People tend to think that they have justice on their side, whether it comes to making or taking.
For example, millions of homeowners have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on the premise that the tax deduction for mortgages will be continued. If they support a continuation of that deduction they hardly feel like brigands, even though a bipartisan consensus of economists doubts the efficiency of this tax break.
As years and decades pass, recipients of this deduction and other benefits start to see them as deeply and richly deserved. Furthermore, almost all of us reap one or more of these benefits, so few individuals are consistently opposed to all government transfers.
It becomes difficult for a politician to articulate exactly what is wrong with this arrangement when the audience itself is in on the game and perhaps does not want to hear about its own takings.
A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE The Founding Fathers were extremely worried about the threat to society posed by corruption and privilege-seeking.
Drawing on examples going back to antiquity, they understood how unmitigated wealth-taking could create a negative and cumulatively self-reinforcing political dynamic. They also understood that the Constitution -- or any constitution -- would be an extremely imperfect remedy for this problem.
It is therefore correct to reject Mr. Romney's depiction as off-base and misleading. Yet the fact that he didn't present the truth is an indication that the problem is actually worse than many of us realize.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Transforming Our Schools

 BODY:
Readers react to a student's ideas for a learning 'revolution.'
To the Editor:
When President George W. Bush signed No Child Left Behind into law, few would have predicted that the next decade of education policy would unfold into a disaster of epic proportions. The law was based on a flawed concept of a ''good education'' -- high scores on standardized tests.
As a result, the curriculum was narrowed, shaving instruction time in the arts, music, science and history. Schools were transformed into test-preparation factories with a stress on drill, kill, bubble-fill methods. And ruthless accountability measures were enacted, with bribes and threats at their core. It's safe to say that the law has failed miserably.
Yet when President Obama came into office, he enacted Race to the Top, a $4.35 billion competition that dished out money to states that adopted the president's policies. In effect, it was No Child Left Behind on steroids. The pressure to garner high test scores has gone haywire, the number of cheating scandals has mushroomed and the teaching profession has been dehumanized. Enough is enough. 
In this election cycle, both Mitt Romney and President Obama have largely ducked the issue. Instead of proposing a bold, game-changing plan to transform schools for the 21st century, they remain stubbornly fixed on the status quo. We cannot afford to lose yet another decade of precious time and resources. Reforms are not enough; only a revolution will suffice.
As a student, I want to be taught how to think and create and explore. I'm not a number in a spreadsheet; I'm a creative and motivated human being. I want my teachers to be paid well, given autonomy and treated like professionals. I want my school to be adequately funded. Is that too much to ask?
If either candidate called for the repeal of No Child Left Behind and the abolition of Race to the Top, and pushed schools to allow students to become the captains of their learning, he would find millions of teachers, parents and young people at his side.
NIKHIL GOYAL Syosset, N.Y., Oct. 8, 2012
The writer is a high school senior and the author of the book ''One Size Does Not Fit All: A Student's Assessment of School.''
Readers React
Mr. Goyal points out an essential and alarming feature of the politics of education: It's the one place where Democrats and Republicans have been willing, even eager, to embrace the same ideas. For all the talk of the benefits of bipartisanship, this signature effort has been an unmitigated disaster for American schools. If anything, Mr. Goyal understates the extent of the damage.
The greatest danger of the accountability movement is that it shifts the conversation away from the real needs of American schools. It is much easier to talk about test scores than it is to advocate adequate and equitable school funding, strong early intervention programs, and a highly qualified, professionalized and well-paid teaching force.
Perhaps this explains bipartisan support for an educational system of, by and for tests. For politicians who wish to avoid accountability for the state of our schools, the accountability movement is the right answer.
STEVEN K. WOJCIKIEWICZ Monmouth, Ore., Oct. 10, 2012
The writer is an associate professor of teacher education at the Western Oregon University College of Education and a former high school teacher.
Mr. Goyal does not speak for all students. I am a high school senior and was involved in protesting Connecticut's education reform bill on the principle that the way it approached testing was wrong -- something I wholeheartedly agree with Mr. Goyal on. But not every student believes that standardized testing is the devil or that the American education system is designed to suppress us.
The answer, as I see it, is not to eliminate testing. Nor is it to eliminate federal standardization of curriculums or objective evaluation of schools -- all things Race to the Top and No Child Left Behind strive to do. Let's fix what's broken -- our tests -- by pushing for better, smarter tests, not eliminating them.
ANDREW BOWLES Westport, Conn., Oct. 10, 2012
I don't need to look at Mr. Goyal's eighth-grade English language arts test score, or how he fared on his high school Regents exams, to know that he is a smart and critical thinker, that he is a ''creative and motivated human being.'' This is glaringly obvious even from his short letter. So why is it that many policy makers and education wonks believe that they need to?
What these policy makers should be doing is looking to students like Mr. Goyal to figure out new ways to solve our most pressing education policy problems. Organizations like Urban Youth Collaborative in New York City harness the power, and insider school knowledge, of local students to challenge the educational status quo. Rather than seeing students as a statistic or a test score, they understand them as valuable sources of policy insight.
Let's stop patronizing young people with lackluster standardized testing and start treating them as a source of expertise in education that could shed some light on how to fix this mess we created.
TARA BAHL New York, Oct. 10, 2012
The writer is an adjunct professor of education at Mercy College.
Surely Mr. Goyal sees the irony in demanding that his affluent Long Island suburban school district, Syosset, be adequately funded and its teachers well paid. Public schools in low-income communities and many of our urban areas haven't fulfilled their promise of a basic education in decades.
Our system of school funding primarily through property taxes does a disservice to the students whose only crime is to live in a less wealthy district. In March 2011, an editorial in this paper (''Rich District, Poor District'') detailed this disparity by comparing the Syosset district with that of Ilion, in an economically depressed area of New York.
Until we commit to a truly level playing field, in which our public schools are funded solely on a national scale, students like Mr. Goyal will always have an unfair advantage over those in Ilion.
JONATHAN CAREY San Francisco, Oct. 10, 2012
I agree with the concern over the very poor results we get for the billions of dollars spent on education in the United States. The attempt by the government to impose some standards was well intended, but as Mr. Goyal pointed out, did not work, twice.
The fundamental problem with education is the government's involvement, and consequently no market dynamic. Give parents and students a choice, as private schools always do, and voucher systems tend to do, and education thrives because there is real accountability. Bad schools, like bad businesses, go away, because they have no customers and are unable to compete.
Technical colleges, community colleges, universities and other forms of education that are market-based are doing just fine. Find a way to bring choice and competition into grade school and high school education, as some communities have done with voucher programs, and the market will solve the education problem.
BILL FOTSCH Villa Hills, Ky., Oct. 10, 2012
I'm a college student and future teacher who is deeply committed to educational equity and social justice, but I was incredibly frustrated by Mr. Goyal's piece. While Mr. Goyal highlights some of the issues affecting our education system, his letter lacks nuance and makes several overstatements.
As a student, I too want to be taught ''how to think and create and explore.'' But I also realize that if I couldn't read or write or do basic math, I'd have a lot of trouble making it to college -- much less finding a job that pays the bills.
As a future teacher, I want to be held accountable for my students' learning. Certainly, ''learning'' can't be boiled down to a fill-in-the-bubble test, but when used as part of a holistic and balanced evaluation system, standardized test scores can add value. I wouldn't feel ''dehumanized,'' as Mr. Goyal suggests, if I were assessed against quantitative and qualitative measures.
Moving forward, we students need to realize that things aren't as simple as they seem. Let's approach these issues with a sense of humility and ambivalence.
RYAN HEISINGER College Park, Md., Oct. 10, 2012
I have two children in middle school. Why does it seem to me that while there is so much more to learn today, my children are learning less and spending more time and requiring tutors to do so? Why were my children taught fuzzy math? How much more can we dumb down the next generation?
When is the government going to require schools to step up to the plate and teach? Stop teaching my children to simply spit back answers, and stop using them as guinea pigs to try out the latest math program from a company that just wants to make money. Teach them how to think.
SUSAN ZAHLER Plainview, N.Y., Oct. 10, 2012
Reading ''A Student's Call to Arms'' both shocked and saddened me. When my sons were starting school over 30 years ago, we specifically chose a school that was run on Mr. Goyal's vision, to educate children rather than to test them.
Mr. Goyal's letter certainly describes a backward slide of mammoth proportions. Education is too important to leave to lazy politicians who would quantify it in order to proclaim success.
SIDNEY S. STARK New York, Oct. 10, 2012
The Writer Responds
I agree with Mr. Bowles that we need better ways of measuring students. However, testing isn't one. Assessment is. There's a difference. A test is used to tell whether a student memorized and regurgitated enough material. Interestingly, the man who invented the multiple choice test, which is now ubiquitous, later denounced it as a ''test of lower order thinking for the lower orders.''
An assessment, on the other hand, is an ongoing process of describing, gathering, recording and reflecting. Schools like High Tech High in San Diego and Brightworks in San Francisco are leveraging the power of assessments, using digital portfolios to reflect students' work -- blog posts, essays, podcasts, presentations. This is in line with the argument by Ms. Bahl. When we begin to shift the way we assess students, then we will witness true learning and creativity.
To address accountability, which Mr. Wojcikiewicz stressed, we should sample rather than assess every single student, similar to what Gallup does with public opinion surveys.
If we're going to bring about a learning revolution in America, we need to do a lot more to change the conversation. Let's push our politicians with common-sense ideas: finance schools adequately, evaluate students and teachers appropriately, treat students like adults, allow student-centered, project-based learning to flourish, and invigorate the gush of creativity and curiosity within us all.
President Obama, Mitt Romney, are you listening?

HEADLINE: Romney's Go-To Economist

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
''I HOPE you're sitting down for this,'' said Ali Velshi, the CNN anchor, staring into the camera, his voice booming with incredulity about a campaign promise issued by Mitt Romney: that, if elected, Mr. Romney would create 12 million jobs in four years.
Having framed this idea as preposterous, Mr. Velshi introduced R. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School, a Romney campaign adviser and a ''very smart man,'' as the host put it. So smart, Mr. Velshi told Mr. Hubbard, that ''you couldn't have been involved in the writing of that policy.'' Why? ''Because you would know that that is just not possible.''
Wearing a dark suit and projecting an air of geeky, avuncular calm, Mr. Hubbard appeared before a blue backdrop festooned with the words ''Columbia Business School.'' If he was supposed to be cowed or disarmed by the bluster or flattery, he did not show it. 
''It is absolutely possible, Ali, both in terms of models of policy effects on the recovery and historical experience,'' he said, in a tone that was professorial but not patronizing, ''If you look at the recovery from '74, '75, or '81, '82, you can easily get job growth in this range. We have the wrong policy mix. We've had a nasty shock, we're in a different situation, but we could do a lot better.''
Succinct, authoritative and unabashedly partisan. Leave aside that most economists see a vast difference between the recessions of the '70s and '80s and the crisis that began in 2008. This was exactly the sort of performance Mr. Hubbard has been delivering for the Republican candidate, both on television and in op-ed articles, for more than a year. Straddling the occasionally uncomfortable line between academia and politics, Mr. Hubbard is playing a role now familiar in modern campaigns: the in-house economist.
Mr. Hubbard has helped to draft many of Mr. Romney's economic and tax policies, and, at least implicitly, lent his imprimatur to others he did not conceive. The benefits are potentially mutual. If Mr. Romney is elected, Mr. Hubbard is considered a strong candidate for the job of Treasury secretary and even, after Ben S. Bernanke's term expires, chairman of the Federal Reserve. (Robert Zoellick, former president of the World Bank, is another possible contender for the Treasury job.)
To the job of in-house economist, Mr. Hubbard brings a rare ability to translate complex policy into plain English, as well as a conservative's love for small government and a faith that cutting taxes will spur growth. During a stint as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for President George W. Bush, from 2001 to 2003, Mr. Hubbard was known as the principal architect of the Bush tax cuts.
Mr. Hubbard also brings to this job a certain amount of baggage. He appeared briefly in ''Inside Job,'' a scathing and Oscar-winning 2010 documentary about the financial crisis. The film has a segment about high-profile professors who blessed many of the financial instruments that led to the fiasco. Enter Mr. Hubbard, who is presented as a leading thinker far too cozy with industries he ought to be assessing at a critical distance.
''You have three more minutes,'' he tells an interviewer who is pressing for the names of his consulting clients. And then, as his face contorts with rage, he adds, ''Give it your best shot.''
MR. HUBBARD is hardly the only marquee economist to parlay his experience and stature into millions of dollars, for speeches, papers and expert witness testimony. Lawrence H. Summers, once the Obama administration's top economic adviser, pocketed about $5.2 million in compensation for giving advice to a hedge fund. But in Mr. Hubbard's case, some of his amply compensated work takes policy stands that buttress the viewpoints of the corporate interests that are paying him.
That's been true of the mutual fund industry, which has paid him more than $1 million over the years. In an academic paper and a book, he took a strong position favoring the industry's approach to fees, which critics say hurt everyday investors. He was paid what he called an honorarium of $150,000 for the academic paper by the insurance arm of the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund industry trade and lobbying group.
''Dean Hubbard is a mercenary,'' says John P. Freeman, emeritus professor of business and professional ethics at the University of South Carolina School of Law, who has accused the mutual fund industry of profiteering, ''out to protect fund managers who are taking advantage of investors.''
Mr. Hubbard says the source of funding is irrelevant because his academic writing stands on its own.
Some of Mr. Hubbard's extracurricular activities have also made faculty members at his Columbia Business School unhappy, because, they say, they reflect poorly on the institution. Others complain that he has run the school with a somewhat autocratic hand and feel that they have been buffaloed into casting votes and rallying behind causes that they haven't necessarily supported.
One of those causes was Mr. Hubbard himself. It's been a well-kept secret, but faculty members say that in 2008, the president of Columbia, Lee C. Bollinger, wanted to bounce Mr. Hubbard from his job. Why? Nobody has offered an explanation, not even to the senior faculty members who were asked at a meeting to rally behind their leader by signing a petition of support. Neither Mr. Hubbard nor Mr. Bollinger would answer questions on the subject.
Mr. Hubbard's friends and fans note that he is a conservative leading an institution dominated by liberals, and that some friction is inevitable. As for calling Mr. Hubbard a mercenary -- that suggests that he will fight for causes he doesn't believe in. Which, one former colleague says, is not so.
''Glenn is ideologically conservative,'' says Ron Miller, a former economics professor at Columbia who now works for NERA, an economic consulting firm. ''Nobody has to pay him to say this stuff. That's what he believes.''
Mr. Hubbard declined to be interviewed for this article, citing a busy schedule. He agreed to answer questions via e-mail, though many seemed the answers of a man striving to come across as nothing-to-see-here bland. He also provided the names of some friends, many of whom wanted to underscore the same idea: the guy is not bland.
''Did you know, for instance, that he has a brother who is a country music star?'' asked Kevin A. Hassett, a friend and scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
Hubbard's younger brother, Gregg -- known to fans as Hobie -- is a member of Sawyer Brown, a country rock band that gained fame via ''Star Search,'' a sort of precursor to ''American Idol.''
''He's always had a great sense of humor,'' says Gregg Hubbard, speaking by telephone before a flight to a concert. He recounts celebrating his 40th birthday in New York City and sharing a gift he had just been given, a Razor scooter, with his brother. ''We were with my older nephew,'' he says, ''and we took turns, the three of us, riding up and down Broadway on a scooter.''
Glenn Hubbard was raised in Apopka, Fla., a suburb of Orlando known as the ''Indoor Foliage Capital of the World,'' because of its many greenhouses. His father taught at a community college, and his mother taught at the high school he attended. She is remembered by her students as both pleasant and exacting, a formidable presence whom Mr. Hubbard's friends regard as the wellspring of her son's discipline and ambition.
''I write a column for a local paper,'' says Bryan Nelson, a state representative and a onetime pupil of Ms. Hubbard's, ''and to this day, when I run into her she has no qualms about telling me what I got wrong -- the grammar, the spelling.''
Glenn Hubbard was an Eagle scout, a star of the chess team and a stellar student who graduated at the top of his class. He scored high enough on College Level Examination Program tests to enter the University of Central Florida with enough credits so he could graduate with two degrees in three years.
''At the age of 8 or 9, we both began collecting coins,'' says Nelson Smith, a childhood friend and now a physician. ''That led to questions about currencies: how the concept of money evolved over the centuries, how systems of finance are set up. He never said, 'I'm going to be an economist,' but you could see that's where his mind was headed.''
Mr. Hubbard received his master's and Ph.D. at Harvard and became a hugely productive scholar with a wide range of interests. Fellow conservatives view his work with pure reverence. From the left, you hear grudging caveats like, ''He'll never win the Nobel Prize.'' He is best known for research in tax policy and government spending programs. One influential study quantified the major role that cash flow plays in driving corporations to invest.
''The lesson,'' says James Poterba, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an admirer of Mr. Hubbard, ''is that if someone is looking for policy instruments that might raise investment, then lower corporate rates could do it because you change the current availability of cash for firms.''
On behalf of the Romney campaign, Mr. Hubbard has argued that the Obama administration has ''stuck the economy in a slow growth trap,'' as it was put in a recent position paper, ''The Romney Program for Economic Recovery, Growth and Jobs,'' of which he was a co-author.
The way out of this trap, he and his co-authors wrote, is to reduce federal spending, cut marginal income tax rates by 20 percent across the board and gradually reduce the growth in Social Security and Medicare benefits for more affluent seniors. He would also like to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial legislation and the Affordable Care Act.
That paper, of course, is a campaign document, but if Mr. Hubbard has any differences with Mr. Romney on economic matters, he won't name them. ''I support Governor Romney's economic program,'' he wrote when asked if his candidate had any taken positions he does not support.
If Mr. Hubbard becomes Treasury secretary, cutting taxes would very likely be his highest priority. Altering the tax code to encourage savings and bolster investment has been one of his favorite causes. While serving under President Bush as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, he pushed to reduce dividend taxes to zero. (Ultimately, the top tax rate on dividends was cut by more than half, to 15 percent.)
In that job, he also demonstrated great skills as political player. He turned the council, which had existed until then mainly to rah-rah administration policy, into a force in Washington.
''Glenn usurped the Treasury Department on tax policy,'' says Leonard E. Burman, a professor of public affairs at Syracuse University who worked at the Treasury Department during the Clinton administration. ''I had friends who worked at the department after I left, and they said that Glenn shifted the balance of power dramatically.''
As Mr. Hubbard has moved seamlessly through the Republican upper echelons of Washington, he has also cultivated relationships in corporate suites. He serves on three corporate boards, which collectively paid him $785,000 last year. One of those is the board of KKR Financial, a finance firm affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm of which Henry R. Kravis was a co-founder. In 2010, Mr. Kravis pledged $100 million to the Columbia Business School, his alma mater, for the construction of a new building. It was the largest gift in the school's history.
DURING his eight years as dean, Mr. Hubbard has charmed some faculty members and alienated others. A few say that despite his buttoned-up appearance, he is approachable and is always up for some banter.
''He was teaching a class across the hall and I would complain to him, 'Glenn, why is my classroom such a sauna?' '' says Jonathan Levav, a former member of the faculty who is now an associate professor of marketing at Stanford. ''And he would say: 'That's funny. The temperature in my classroom is perfect.' When the person in power can have fun with you like that, it puts you at ease. It puts a human face on your boss.''
Mr. Hubbard can take a bit of needling, too, says Raymond Horton, a professor of ethics and corporate governance at Columbia Business School.
''When Romney made his 47 percent boo-boo, I went to the dean's office and said 'Way to go, Glenn,' '' Professor Horton says. He diplomatically declined to put Mr. Hubbard's response on the record.
There is another, more prickly side to Mr. Hubbard, though it is not a side he has shown very often. One faculty member who saw it is Noel Capon, a tenured professor in the school's marketing department. In October 2010, he received a letter from Christopher J. Mayer, a professor in the finance and economics division who was then the senior vice dean, accusing him of violating a number of Columbia University rules on outside commercial ventures. The letter had what Mr. Capon considered an aggressive tone; it took him aback. After a few months and a conversation with a fellow professor, Mr. Capon concluded that Mr. Hubbard was behind what he regarded as a carefully orchestrated campaign against him. The point, he believes, was to bully him into line.
''There were situations in the past where I might have made statements that challenged Glenn,'' says Mr. Capon, who acknowledges that he has a hard time keeping his opinion to himself. One opinion he couldn't keep to himself concerned a decision, in May 2010, to offer tenure to a professor from another university -- a decision he opposed. He wrote a letter saying so, copying the provost, and stating that the process had not allowed him to air his dissenting views. (The issue went away when the outside professor turned down the job.)
Eventually, Mr. Capon met with Mr. Hubbard to discuss the issues raised in Mr. Mayer's October letter.
Mr. Capon says Mr. Hubbard told him that ''you've given me crap from the day I started'' and that ''you've been abusive from Day 1.''
Mr. Hubbard says that he never said those words. ''I would not speak in that manner to anyone, let alone a faculty colleague,'' he wrote.
Mr. Mayer did not reply to e-mails requesting comment.
The dispute ultimately fizzled away. But Mr. Capon is no longer buying Mr. Hubbard's placid exterior.
''If he's crossed,'' Mr. Capon said, ''he can be brutal.''
As dean, Mr. Hubbard has made some high-profile hires, including Patrick Bolton, a specialist in contract theory who was lured away from Princeton, and twice revamped the curriculum, to give students more flexibility in choosing classes and to shorten the time it takes to complete required courses.
Neither change was controversial, but the way some decisions have been made at the school was described as ''Brezhnevian'' by one professor, who like many interviewed for this article requested anonymity in order to preserve relationships with the school. In one vote, faculty members were asked to raise a hand if they were in favor of a particular change. There were no dissenters, several attendees recalled.
The most memorable vote came in the fall of 2008, when Mr. Mayer gathered senior faculty members and made a surprising announcement: Dean Hubbard's job was in peril. President Bollinger was balking at appointing him to a second five-year term.
According to several participants, Mr. Mayer urged professors to demonstrate their support for Mr. Hubbard with a petition, which attendees were asked to sign on the spot. Several current and former faculty members used the identical word to describe the experience: bizarre.
It wasn't just that some professors, even fans of Mr. Hubbard's, felt a little coerced. It was that nobody had any idea why President Bollinger wanted to jettison him.
''I was not happy,'' one faculty member says. ''There was no way to have a view on the subject. It was like signing a contract that you haven't read.'' Mr. Mayer did not reply to e-mails seeking comment.
In an e-mail, Mr. Hubbard kept his thoughts on this subject to an anodyne minimum. ''I am honored that President Bollinger gave me the opportunity to be dean,'' he wrote.
Mr. Bollinger declined to discuss this episode or respond to written questions about it. He sent an e-mail that described Mr. Hubbard as ''a distinguished academic economist who as dean has maintained an active, engaged voice in the public debate.''
In absence of any official word, faculty members have been left to speculate about why Mr. Hubbard nearly lost his job. Nor does anyone know why Mr. Bollinger decided to reappoint him, though current and former faculty members have a pet theory: that Mr. Bollinger was worried about losing the financial support of Mr. Hubbard's friends, most notably Mr. Kravis.
As several faculty members pointed out, a little acidly, Mr. Hubbard had helped to cut taxes for people like Mr. Kravis. ''They owed him,'' one professor said.
IN conversations with Columbia Business School faculty members, you hear occasional hints of irritation with Mr. Hubbard over his cameo in ''Inside Job'' and the embarrassment they say it visited on the school. Part of the reason is that the fallout led to new and more stringent conflict-of-interest and disclosure rules -- and that those forced many professors to drop lucrative side projects. It's as though Mr. Hubbard was caught overeating, so everyone had to go on a diet.
Others question whether it is wise for Mr. Hubbard to take on certain clients. For instance, he served as an expert witness in the defense of two Bear Stearns hedge fund managers accused of defrauding investors in 2009. Both men were ultimately acquitted, and in a recent interview, one of their lawyers, Edward Little, praised Mr. Hubbard's testimony as ''absolutely critical.'' Some at the school wonder whether it served the institution's interests for its leader to be publicly linked with people accused in one of the only Wall Street cases to stem from the great recession.
Asked whether he was concerned about connecting the school to matters like the Bear Stearns prosecution, Mr. Hubbard wrote, ''I am comfortable that I balance my scholarship and teaching, deanship, and outside activities very well.''
That balance has included work for many corporations that have generated unflattering headlines in recent years. On his résumé, in the category of ''consulting or advisory relationships,'' Mr. Hubbard lists Freddie Mac, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. He was co-author of a paper with William C. Dudley, then the chief economist of Goldman Sachs, titled ''How Capital Markets Enhance Economic Performance and Facilitate Job Creation,'' which praised derivatives and the housing boom in 2004, as both were inflating into an epic bubble.
''Credit derivative obligations have become an important element that has helped protect bank lending portfolios against loss,'' he and Mr. Dudley wrote.
The mutual fund industry has been a major source of income for Mr. Hubbard, and through that work he has taken a solidly pro-industry stand on a much-debated and much-litigated question: Do mutual fund advisers gouge clients by charging excessive fees? No, Mr. Hubbard argued in a paper he wrote with John C. Coates IV of Harvard Law School, titled ''Competition in the Mutual Fund Industry.''
In the paper, the authors argued that it was essentially impossible for mutual fund advisers to overcharge on fees because the mutual fund business was so competitive. As the authors wrote, ''fund investors may fire advisers at any time by redeeming shares and switching to other investments.''
Unlike Mr. Hubbard, who was paid that $150,000 honorarium for the paper, Professor Coates said in an interview that he had not taken any money from the Investment Company Institute and that as a matter of personal policy did not accept money in such circumstances for academic work.
Mr. Hubbard earned much more making the same pro-industry point in several court appearances, as an expert witness on behalf of corporations and mutual fund interests. One of those cases was a lawsuit by employees of ABB, a power generation products manufacturer, against the company and Fidelity, the mutual fund giant, over accusations that ABB paid excessive fees, at the employees' expense, to manage the company's 401(k) plan.
During a cross-examination, Mr. Hubbard said Fidelity had paid him $420,000 for his participation in the case. About $200,000 of that was direct billings -- he charged $1,200 an hour -- and the rest came from a company called the Analysis Group, which provides teams of experts for research projects. Mr. Hubbard earned 7.5 percent of the amount that Analysis Group researchers charged Fidelity.
A federal judge in Missouri ultimately found that ABB and Fidelity had breached a number of their fiduciary duties and in March of this year ordered ABB to pay $35.2 million and Fidelity to pay $1.7 million for losses.
But Professor Freeman at the University of South Carolina says he believes that Mr. Hubbard's scholarship on this subject -- particularly the paper he co-wrote -- was shoddy and did genuine damage.
''What Hubbard and Coates have done is pour holy water on the Investment Company Institute's hopelessly stupid defense of fees charged by mutual funds,'' he said in a telephone interview. That Mr. Hubbard took money for the paper casts doubts on his motives, Professor Freeman says.
Mr. Hubbard wrote that he did not worry that the money might appear to influence his findings.
''Any work of scholarship rises or falls on its ideas, empirical support, and argument,'' he wrote. ''Readers can then make whatever judgment they wish.''
IF Mr. Hubbard becomes the Treasury secretary, the job will surely mean a drastic cut in pay. What it would mean for the rest of the country is not easy to divine; the Romney campaign has been vague on many details, particularly how it would offset a 20 percent across-the-board tax cut without adding to the deficit.
But you can get a pretty good sense from looking at the economic priorities of the George W. Bush administration, says Martin N. Baily, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton and is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Mr. Baily was a critic of the Bush tax cuts because, he says, they left the country without the wherewithal to battle the great recession.
''When I read the Romney economic plan,'' he wrote in an e-mail, ''it seemed to me that it was basically the Bush plan.''
There are plenty of centrist and right-of-center economists who think that Mr. Hubbard would make a fine Treasury secretary. They are impressed by his intellect, trust his instincts and commend his leadership during previous stints in Washington.
Some right-leaning economists, though, have reservations. Their worry is that Mr. Hubbard is not enough of a deficit hawk, and that if he follows through with tax cuts as articulated in the Romney plan, the results could be a disaster.
''Cutting taxes in 2001 wasn't a crime,'' says Luigi Zingales, an economist at the University of Chicago, who was one of the co-authors of an op-ed article with Mr. Hubbard. ''Not fixing the deficit today is. If you think he's a guy who'll go ahead and play the same strategy, which I have to say most people do, then we'll ultimately wind up with an even bigger deficit. I trust he's smart enough not to play the same strategy.''

HEADLINE: Is There Life After Mitt?

BYLINE: By MATT BAI. 
Matt Bai is the magazine's chief political correspondent. He last wrote about the economy in Ohio.

 BODY:
Not long ago, David Winston, a leading pollster in the Republican Party, listed for me some of the empirical reasons that Mitt Romney should be winning the election. In the past 64 years, Winston said, only six presidents had run for re-election at a time when the unemployment rate was above 6 percent, and five of them lost. (The exception was Ronald Reagan, whose unemployment rate, while over 7 percent, had dropped almost three full points since his election.) Since 1948, when the government started keeping such statistics, the country experienced a total of 82 months with an unemployment rate of more than 8 percent, and 43 of those months came under President Obama -- more than the previous 11 administrations combined. George H. W. Bush's economy grew at triple the rate of Obama's during his last quarter before the election, and he never stood a chance. 
Obama hasn't won anything yet, of course, and on the day Winston and I talked, Romney still had three debates in which to make his case. But in Republican circles, you can already hear the howls of agony and recrimination. ''When you have unemployment that high, and the economy is perceived to be as weak as it is, the door is wide open for a challenger, irrespective of party,'' Winston told me. ''You have to lay out the alternative so that people have something to go to.'' The main question facing the party, should Romney lose, will be this: Was the fateful flaw the candidate's inability to articulate that alternative, or was it the alternative itself?
Recent history would suggest that a second straight presidential defeat would prompt a serious rethinking of the Republican agenda, especially because the party would have lost four of the last six presidential elections (and the margins of victory in both winning elections were narrower than Michele Bachmann's mind). Democrats were in a similar position after 1988, when Bill Clinton and other centrists fought to modernize the party's fossilized message. A decade later, after Clinton's successive victories, George W. Bush sought to recast Republicans under the banner of ''compassionate conservatism,'' staking out more salable positions on education and immigration.
You could certainly make the case that conservative doctrine in 2012 is courting obsolescence. The party's core solutions to all manner of economic problems -- the lowering of marginal tax rates and the loosening of regulations -- had a lot more resonance in Ronald Reagan's day, when the highest tax rate stood at 70 percent (it's now half that) and before the unfettered banking system nearly took down the American economy. And while Paul Ryan may be right that most Americans are open to the conservative critique of costly entitlement programs, they don't appear to trust conservatives to fix the problem. This is why Romney's ''47 percent'' comment proved so devastating -- not because he blithely dismissed the votes of nearly half the electorate but because he reinforced the image of a party whose real agenda was to dismantle the federal safety net and then go home.
Meanwhile, as the country grows more diverse, Republicans rely ever more heavily on old, white, male voters. ''The path the party is on, which is to extract more and more votes from a shrinking portion of the country, a path that offers the middle class frighteningly little, is not a sustainable path,'' argues David Frum, the former Bush speechwriter and insurrectionist blogger. John Weaver, who ran Jon Huntsman's failed campaign, puts it this way: ''We need to have a discussion about the future of our party. It won't be a pleasant discussion, as family discussions often aren't, but we need to have it.''
And yet, while the likes of Frum and Weaver await the Grand Debate, there are good reasons to believe they'll be waiting awhile, even if their candidate is beat. In that case, conservatives would have no problem convincing themselves that the blame lies entirely with Romney, who has mostly proved himself to be every bit the timid, error-prone candidate many feared he would be -- and nothing like the model of management efficiency they hoped for. Political partisans will go to extraordinary lengths to blame the messenger rather than question the orthodoxies of their message. In this case, they would barely have to exert themselves.
Anguished Republicans might console themselves too with the idea that incumbent presidents are historically difficult to dislodge. Three incumbents have been booted from office in the last 36 years; all of them were weakened by primary challengers, and two of the three were further undone by serious third-party candidacies. Before that, you have to go back to Herbert Hoover to find a president who ran for re-election and lost.
And even if Republicans wake up on Nov. 7 facing a grim demographic reality, they still won't find themselves marginalized in the way they were just four years earlier, when both the White House and Congress slipped from their grasp (or, for that matter, in the way that Democrats were after suffering a near total rejection in 2004). If Romney loses, Republicans will almost certainly control the House, and possibly the Senate too, along with more than half the country's governorships. If the last several elections teach us anything, it's that cycles of power move faster now, and what the political scientists used to think of as cosmic realignments of the parties turn out now to be something more like fleeting rearrangements. Republicans aren't likely to go on some kind of vision quest when a return to near-total power remains just one tantalizing election away.
What's likely to happen instead, if it comes to that, is that the attention will instantly shift toward the new generation of potential messengers: Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio, Chris Christie and Bobby Jindal. And there will immediately be, as there was on Romney, enormous pressure to soothe and placate the activist base before making a bid to redefine conservatism for the broad center of the electorate. Already Rush Limbaugh has hinted darkly at the creation of a reactionary third party should Romney lose (as if somehow his losing could be laid on the centrists whose advice Romney has almost uniformly ignored).
Those aspirants for 2016 may well have better political instincts than Romney, but the trap that awaits them is the same. Romney spent the last few years trying to ingratiate himself to primary voters, the idea being, presumably, that he would have six months to chart his own, more moderate path after he claimed the nomination. He hasn't. Nor does he seem to have given any deep thought to what a more pragmatic and inclusive agenda might actually entail. But that may have less to do with Romney's erratic campaign than with the unreconcilable dilemma facing anyone who wants to lead Republicans after November. You can channel the extremists, or you can lead your party toward modernity, but you really can't do both.

HEADLINE: An Extra Ingredient in North Dakota Politics: Oil

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: An oil boom has changed the economic outlook for North Dakota; the boom's effect on the state's political situation is still emerging. 

 BODY:
 We continue our Presidential Geography series, an examination of each state's political landscape and how it's changing. Here is North Dakota, the Peace Garden State. FiveThirtyEight spoke with Mark S. Jendrysik and Dana Harsell, both professors of political science at the University of North Dakota. 
The recipe for Democratic success in North Dakota, a Republican-leaning state, has long been the same: be personable, be moderate and champion the farm. 
But a new ingredient, Bakken shale oil, has recently been added to the state's partisan mix. The boom in oil in western North Dakota may solidify the Republican hold on the state, or it could stir voters to take another look at Democratic policies.
North Dakota is a conservative state. It has been carried by Democrats just five times in 30 presidential elections. The state's electorate is relatively old, predominantly white and socially conservative.
Yet Democrats have been able to compete and even thrive here, just as they have in South Dakota. North Dakota, a place with agrarian roots and a small population (roughly 684,000), has been particularly friendly to Democrats in elections for the United States Senate and House. From 1987 to 2010, North Dakota had an all-Democratic Congressional delegation.
Historically, farmers -- at the mercy of commodity prices, the railroads, the banks, the weather and more -- would turn to collective action and government for protection and stability. That impulse helped give rise to the Nonpartisan League, which was founded in 1915 by a former Socialist Party organizer. The league called for a state-owned bank and a state-owned grain elevator and mill (North Dakota still has all three). 
In 1956, the Nonpartisan League merged with the state's Democratic Party, and for years North Dakota's streak of agrarian populism allowed Democrats to win elections. The state's recent Democratic politicians -- Senator Kent Conrad, former Senator Byron Dorgan and former Representative Earl Pomeroy -- were cut from this tradition.
Today, many farms in North Dakota are no longer tilled by solitary yeoman. Family farms have largely been replaced by giant agribusinesses, Mr. Jendrysik said, and "the populism among the farm class is not there as much as it used to be."
As that populist streak has faded, so has the Democratic Party. In the last decade, Mr. Jendrysik said, Republicans have "pretty much wiped the Democrats out in the legislature, and in terms of statewide offices, they've pretty much wiped the Democrats out there too." Mr. Pomeroy lost re-election in 2010. Mr. Dorgan retired. Mr. Conrad is retiring.
Democrats are now limited to competing in the cities of eastern North Dakota, in Fargo and Grand Forks, as well as the state's American Indian reservations. Democrats win solid majorities in counties dominated by reservations, but in Grand Forks County and Cass County, where Fargo is, Mr. Obama managed only slim victories in 2008, of 5 and 7 percentage points respectively. 
As you travel west, North Dakota becomes less populated and more conservative. Mr. McCain carried almost every county in western North Dakota, including the main population center in the west, Bismarck, with 61 percent of the vote.
The oil bonanza is taking place west and northwest of Bismarck, and the scale is staggering. This year alone, North Dakota overtook California and then Alaska to become the nation's second biggest producer of petroleum, behind only Texas. Six years ago North Dakota ranked ninth.
The oil rush has had a profound effect on the state. Incomes have surged in oil-producing counties, and the state's general fund is flush with cash from new tax revenues. North Dakota was left virtually untouched by the recession; the state's unemployment rate steadily fell throughout. In August, the last month for which data is available, North Dakota had the nation's lowest jobless rate, 3 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But the influx of oil workers has strained infrastructure. Housing is in short supply, giant trucks are tearing up roads and pollution has become a concern.
 The Bellwether: Richland County 
Richland County, in the southeast corner of North Dakota, has been an imperfect bellwether in the last three president elections. It was two percentage points more Democratic-leaning than the state in 2008. But it was a bit more Republican-leaning than the state in 2004 and 2000.
 The Bottom Line 
Mr. Romney is a 100 percent favorite in North Dakota, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast, and the presidential race is unlikely to receive much attention there. Instead, North Dakota's Senate race is center stage, and it may provide an early clue as to how the Bakken oil rush will influence North Dakota politics.
Both Representative Rick Berg, a Republican, and Democrat Heidi Heitkamp have come out in favor of across-the-board energy development, including the Keystone pipeline.
But the perception that national Democrats are hostile to nonrenewable energy sources has helped Republicans in other energy-producing states like West Virginia and Wyoming. And it may in North Dakota. Mr. Berg has tried to tie Ms. Heitkamp to national Democrats, Mr. Jendrysik said, and "Heitkamp is basically running away from the national Democratic Party."
On the other hand, there are energy issues more favorable to the Democratic brand. The oil rush -- specifically hydraulic fracturing and the flaring of natural gas -- has raised environmental concerns, and "a lot of North Dakotans are proud of their environmental heritage and the land around them," Mr. Harsell said.
In addition, a distrust of outsiders that was baked into the state by the experience of farmers could be reawakened. "Big Oil is owned by outside interests," Mr. Harsell said.
How North Dakotans weigh the pros and cons of an oil-saturated economy will partly dictate the effect the Bakken rush has on state politics. This year's senate race may provide an early indication whether North Dakotan Democrats can still maintain identities distinct from national Democrats.
According to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast, the Republican, Mr. Berg, is a 77 percent favorite.

HEADLINE: Glories of Capitalism, With Gas at $40 a Gallon

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
If you have never read Ayn Rand's legendary 1957 novel, ''Atlas Shrugged,'' (guilty!) or seen the 2011 dystopian fantasy ''Atlas Shrugged: Part I'' (not guilty, alas), you may have trouble parsing who's doing what and why in that movie's narratively addled sequel. ''Atlas Shrugged: Part II,'' which opened on Friday and was not shown in advance to critics for The New York Times, takes off where ''Part I'' left off. Like the first, it opens in 2016 with the world gripped in an economic crisis (and rife with amusingly torpid Occupy-style protests) that has led to an astonishing development that sounds like an environmentalist's dream: because gas costs more than $40 a gallon, Americans now rely on railroads as their major means of transportation. 
How the infrastructure materialized on a large enough scale to support the nation's newly train-hopping citizens isn't addressed in the first movie, nor is it taken up in ''Part II.'' No matter, business is brisk enough to keep the railroad tycoon Dagny Taggart (a wan Samantha Mathis, replacing the first movie's Taylor Schilling) on the go, driving and walking and sometimes riding a train, as she worryingly keeps tabs on her company, Taggart Transcontinental, and on her weak sister of a brother, James (Patrick Fabian). In her downtime she cuddles with her married lover, Hank Rearden (Jason Beghe, also new), a steel manufacturer, and frets about all the bigwigs -- industrialists and artists -- who have abruptly disappeared, trailed by the mysterious words ''Who is John Galt?''
The producers are going to have to hire a better director if they want moviegoers to be curious enough about this Galt guy to buy a ticket for the presumptive third and final chapter. (Randians already know the answer to that question.) The director on ''Part II,'' John Putch, is a marginal improvement over the one for ''Part I'' (Paul Johansson), but the results are still borderline amateurish. Shot in what looks like digital -- the unflattering kind that turns each neck crease into a crevice and affords you a dermatologically close peek at every pore -- ''Part II'' has the kind of flat, undifferentiated network-television lighting that can do nothing to soften faces or the chintzy-looking sets and costumes. If you want to know what a real movie looks like, rent King Vidor's riotously overheated 1949 version of Rand's ''Fountainhead.''
The other problem with ''Atlas Shrugged: Part II'' is that, like ''Part I,'' it was made for true believers. Written by Duke Sandefur, Brian Patrick O'Toole and Duncan Scott, it jumps from one location to another -- transportation is a subject as well as a visual and narrative motif -- without smoothing the edges, creating coherent transitions or, as bad, trimming the long, draggy passages of people moving, staring into space or sitting around and talking at one another (and you) about the evils of federal regulation and the glories of capitalism.
The only relief from this chatter comes from the cameos, including from Teller (of Penn & Teller), Sean Hannity and Grover Norquist, who is thanked in the credits, not far from the logo for IATSE, which represents stagehands and other entertainment workers, affirming that this anti-union movie was a union production.
''Atlas Shrugged: Part II'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Philosophy and ideology.
Atlas Shrugged: Part II
Opened on Friday nationwide.
Directed by John Putch; written by Brian Patrick O'Toole, Duke Sandefur and Duncan Scott, based on the book by Ayn Rand; produced by Harmon Kaslow, John Aglialoro and Jeff Freilich. Running time: 1 hour 52 minutes.
WITH: Samantha Mathis (Dagny Taggart), Jason Beghe (Hank Rearden), Patrick Fabian (James Taggart), Richard T. Jones (Eddie Willers), Esai Morales (Francisco d'Anconia) and Diedrich Bader (Quentin Daniels).

HEADLINE: Rapid Growth Is Forecast For Online Work

BYLINE: By QUENTIN HARDY

 BODY:
If you thought it has been tough to find good work over the last couple of years, just wait.
The old problem was a bad economy, the kind of thing that ends. Trends suggest that we're heading for a global online arbitrage of opportunity, however, with good workers in bad places able to snatch business away from better-performing environments. If that happens in large numbers, the competition will get really fierce for everyone.
Recently two of the biggest online staffing companies, oDesk and Elance, have released surveys concerning the companies that hire workers over the Internet to do things like write software, and the mindset of online workers themselves. 
Between them, oDesk and Elance claim to have more than four million coders, Web designers, marketing professionals and other workers. Some even spot porn on Facebook at a rate of four for a penny. In the second quarter of 2012, oDesk says, its contractors worked over 8.5 million hours, a 70 percent increase over a year earlier. The average freelancer at Elance, meantime, expects to make 43 percent more money in 2013, as more employers come online.
Taken together, the reports indicate a lot of growth ahead in the business, and a lot of talented people looking for work wherever they can find it. oDesk, which surveyed over 2,800 companies that used its service, found that 10 percent of these buyers were college students, and 58 percent described their companies as start-ups.
Not all those young companies will survive, but the habit of hiring online seems baked in; 64 percent of respondents said at least half of their work force would be online by 2015, and 94 percent predicted that in 10 years most businesses would consist of online temps and physical full-time workers.
The range of jobs done online is increasing, too. Workers on Elance said the highest-growing job categories in 2013 would be Web programming, making mobile applications, design, marketing and content writing. oDesk respondents were heavily in those categories too, but also saw employment in customer service, secretarial work and high-level technology development.
"As we move along, we see an increase in all the categories of work," said Gary Swart, the chief executive of oDesk. "We now have lawyers, accountants, financial executives, even managers." The only work unlikely to go online is immediate physical work, like plumbing, he said, adding, "but even a plumber needs an accountant."
What he doesn't need, apparently, is an accountant anywhere nearby. Some 30 percent of the United States citizens working on oDesk are working for overseas companies, Mr. Swart said. An even greater number of overseas people are probably working for Americans, too. In interviews, both companies say the continuing economic troubles in Europe are driving more people to online employment. oDesk has seen a 78 percent growth in hours billed by companies in Britain this year, even though it has never had much of a presence there.
The online work is already changing how some governments think about labor. Last May the government of Bangladesh decided to classify online work as export-related commercial income, free of taxes, instead of as a taxed offshore remittance.
The idea, Mr. Swart said, is to foster the growth of online workers. In other words, if you're reading this from one of the better parts of the global economy, it's a good time to think about how to be indispensable.
Another interesting wrinkle from the oDesk survey: Education alone probably won't help you get hired. Only 6 percent of the survey respondents rated schooling as a "very important" reason to hire someone. It was the lowest-rated reason to hire someone. Work experience was first, followed by how other people rated the contractor, pay, portfolio of work, references, and scores on skills tests that oDesk offers online.
In the future, having a degree may be helpful, but having a reputation will be even better.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Republicans Embracing The Appeal Of Cuomo

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
As they seek to maintain a power base in Albany, New York's Republicans have found an unlikely standard-bearer: the state's Democratic governor, Andrew M. Cuomo.
Mr. Cuomo is pictured warmly on a postcard sent by Senator Patricia A. Ritchie of the North Country, on the Web site of Senator Carl L. Marcellino of Long Island and even in television advertisements for the second-highest-ranking Republican in Albany, Senator Thomas W. Libous of Binghamton. At least a dozen Senate Republicans seeking re-election are trumpeting their bonds with Mr. Cuomo.
The Republicans, outnumbered roughly two to one in the state's electorate, are hoping that promoting their ability to work with the popular Democratic governor will help them hold on to control of the State Senate, which is their last stronghold in New York.
''All I heard constantly for the last year and a half was people stopping me saying, 'Libous, we like what you're doing with Cuomo. Keep it up,' '' Mr. Libous said. ''It wasn't rocket science for me to figure out.'' 
Mr. Cuomo, who has forged a productive working relationship with the Senate Republican leadership, has given Republicans plenty to work with. He often praises Republican lawmakers effusively when he visits their districts. And although he has endorsed a few Senate Democrats seeking re-election, he has passed up several opportunities to say that he would like to see his party retake control of the Senate -- a seemingly obvious question, but one that is complicated because the Senate Democrats have been tainted by corruption and chaos in recent years.
''I'm going to make my decisions basically the way the people of the state make their decisions -- on a case-by-case basis,'' Mr. Cuomo said last Monday as he offered his support for the re-election of a Queens Democrat, Senator Joseph P. Addabbo Jr.
The governor has not objected to Republicans' use of his likeness. ''What I've said is, if it's factually accurate, I don't have an issue with it,'' he told reporters last month. The governor's top aide, Lawrence S. Schwartz, was more effusive, telling a radio station in Albany on Thursday that ''you see both Democrats and Republicans alike, in a bipartisan fashion, putting the governor's picture on their mail or running TV ads,'' and that ''everybody is jumping on his bandwagon.''
The governor, who, polls indicate, is extraordinarily popular among both Democrats and Republicans in New York, has advocated some measures sought by Republicans, particularly legislation passed last year to cap the annual growth of property taxes and to partially repeal a payroll tax that had helped finance the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
But Mr. Cuomo has also championed ideas opposed by many conservatives: he successfully pressed the Legislature to legalize same-sex marriage and to create a new top tax bracket for the state's highest earners. And parts of the Democratic agenda have been killed by the Republican-controlled Senate, including a proposal to reduce the impact of the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk policy by decriminalizing the open possession of small amounts of marijuana, as well as measures to require the microstamping of guns and to increase the minimum wage.
Senator Michael N. Gianaris, a Queens Democrat who leads his party's campaign committee, said the Republican embrace of Mr. Cuomo was misleading.
''It's nothing more than a ruse to try to pull the wool over people's eyes, because by their actions, they are blocking progress on a host of issues that the governor wants achieved,'' Mr. Gianaris said. ''No amount of fancy pictures is going to trick people into believing they stand for the things they actively oppose.''
In one instance -- an Assembly race in the Westchester County district where Mr. Cuomo resides -- the use of the governor's image has become a campaign issue. The Republican incumbent, Robert J. Castelli, has sent several mailings highlighting his relationship with Mr. Cuomo, including one that made it appear as if he and the governor were running mates: it featured a photograph of the two men, along with the words ''Castelli & Cuomo: Leadership for Westchester County.'' The flip side, under the words ''Bipartisan Approach. Real Results,'' listed a number of actions supported by both the assemblyman and the governor, like building a replacement for the Tappan Zee Bridge.
Mr. Castelli's Democratic opponent, David Buchwald, objected, and Democrats sent their own mailer saying, ''Bob Castelli wants you to believe he's one of us ... but he tells the Tea Party he's one of them, too.''
''I think he's tried to confuse voters into thinking that the governor's endorsed him, and that's not the case,'' Mr. Buchwald, a White Plains councilman, said. He added that he wanted Democrats to know ''that they have a candidate on the Democratic line that represents our values.''
Mr. Castelli made no apology for his use of Mr. Cuomo's image and name. ''This is not about partisan politics,'' he said in an interview. ''When a man is right, we should give him credit for what he's done right.''
All of the state's legislative seats are on the ballot in November, and mailings featuring Mr. Cuomo are appearing across New York, in many instances with no mention of the party affiliations of the candidate or the governor. One piece of constituent mail from a first-term Republican state senator from Long Island, Lee M. Zeldin, began by reminding voters of increases in taxes and state spending in 2009 and 2010 -- ''before Andrew Cuomo became our governor and Lee Zeldin became our senator,'' it said.
Mr. Zeldin said in an interview that Mr. Cuomo had ''far exceeded expectations'' since taking office.
''The governor's success is our success as New Yorkers, regardless of whether our governor is a member of the same political party as you or a different political party as you,'' Mr. Zeldin added. ''We need to root for that man or woman to have as much success as possible. So I want to be able to work with him in order to actually get things done.''
In upstate New York, Senator Michael H. Ranzenhofer, a Republican from Erie County, began a postcard about economic development by saying that he had ''partnered with Governor Cuomo in a bipartisan fashion,'' while Senator James L. Seward, a Republican from Otsego County, wrote that private-sector job creation was improving ''due in large part to a new partnership with Governor Cuomo.''
''The reason I include the references to the partnership with Governor Cuomo, and the good working relationship, is because I believe in truth in advertising,'' Mr. Seward said. ''And that is the truth. I've been in the Senate long enough; I've seen the good, the bad and the ugly. And things are good right now.''
Other senators have gone for visual impact. Ms. Ritchie, of the North Country, included a photograph of her standing side by side with Mr. Cuomo along with the declaration: ''Governor Praises Ritchie for Two Years of Progress That Changed Albany.'' And Senator Mark J. Grisanti, a Buffalo Republican, recorded a television advertisement that opened with footage of Mr. Cuomo praising the senator at an event -- ''Mark Grisanti, thank you for your leadership,'' the governor says -- and concluded with the two men embracing each other.
Perhaps no advertisement was more Cuomo-centric than a 30-second commercial produced by Mr. Libous, who is the leader of his caucus's campaign efforts. The spot features three images of Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Libous, who, the narrator says, ''get results'' for his Southern Tier constituents.
''I am a very loyal Republican,'' said Mr. Libous, who is also the deputy Senate majority leader. ''I've been a good Republican all my life. But I'm also an elected official who has been charged by the people who elected me to get things done, and right now, that's going pretty well in New York.''

HEADLINE: New Mayor, Big To-Do List

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
ELYRIA, Ohio
Near the cherished gazebo of Ely Square Park, just outside Donna's Diner, the mayor of Elyria waits with patient grace to perform a wedding already running late. She wears a blue blazer, white pants, a red-white-and-blue scarf and an American flag lapel pin that dazzles when caught by the midday June sun. It is Flag Day.
Finally, to the soft aahs of the park's jubilant fountain, the bride arrives in her white finery to take the hand of her buzz-cut fiancé, whose oversize gray suit ends at his feet in crumpled surprise. The dozen or so guests, some in dresses and holding cameras, others in T-shirts and holding cigarettes, rise from park benches as the mayor prepares to speak.
Whenever Mayor Holly Brinda smiles, dimples appear, and here they are again, as she studies the scene of promise before her. Who knows what the future holds, but these newlyweds enter into their compact with hope, just as Ms. Brinda did when she became the mayor of Elyria on New Year's Day a few months before. 
Challenges were to be expected, of course. But the mayor has discovered that her to-do list grows anytime she steps out into her city -- a city a generation past prosperity.
Where to begin?
The cutbacks that have cost city jobs and reduced city services. The pall settling over downtown. The lack of money to address blight, including the burned-out General Industries factory that a neighboring Fortune 500 company is complaining about -- and you never, ever want to give any business a reason to leave.
Don't misunderstand. Elyria has a lot to offer: several global companies that use cutting-edge technology, one of the country's very best hospitals, a park system that includes not one but two waterfalls, a historic high school that recently underwent a $70 million overhaul; summer concerts in Ely Square. ...
Then again, foreclosed properties pepper the city. The recently renovated train station serves no passenger trains and little purpose, with no connection to the tiny Amtrak depot a quarter of a mile away. Oh, and feral cats: on top of everything else, Elyria has 14,000 feral cats.
Ms. Brinda, 54, plans to address all these problems, cats included. But every day presents a new obstacle, taking up time, eating up momentum. She'll get there, she vows. This is her home. And if any comfort can be found in her city's travails, it is in knowing that Elyria is not alone.
''We're a small window into the opportunities and struggles of all people across the country,'' she says.
But first things first. Here is a hopeful couple standing before her in the gazebo, in a park that holds romantic resonance for her as well. With radiant pride in her role, Mayor Brinda begins the wedding ceremony:
''On behalf of the City of Elyria. ... ''
Elyria's Challenges
On behalf of the City of Elyria, on another fine day, the mayor takes a leisurely drive through her 20-square-mile workplace: a city with 455 public employees, 55,000 residents and about $30 million in its general fund. She climbs into her black S.U.V. and buckles up, her city identification dangling from a lanyard around her neck.
A toy cat, not feral, and photographs of her four grown children rest on the dashboard of her ''official'' -- that is, personal -- car. During her successful challenge last year against an incumbent and fellow Democrat, Ms. Brinda vowed to save precious resources by eliminating a city car for the mayor.
The official Web site for Elyria celebrates the city as the home of the padded bicycle seat, the colored golf ball, the Easter Seal Society, the Heisman Trophy winner Vic Janowicz. ''Founded at the fork of the scenic Black River in 1817 by Heman Ely,'' it says, ''Elyria is a city of 'firsts' and has all the right ingredients to put Elyrians first again.''
That wording -- ''to put Elyrians first again'' -- hints of the myriad challenges awaiting the new mayor. They begin to reveal themselves the moment she pulls out of City Hall's parking lot, since most of the money set aside for street paving this year has been reallocated for more urgent needs.
The mayoral dimples disappear when she talks about the city's problems. This is where her great-grandparents, German immigrants, settled, and where her father, an electronics technician for the Federal Aviation Administration, met her mother, a receptionist at the old General Industries factory that is now a fire-ravaged ruin. She is a fourth-generation Elyrian, and proud of it.
After twirling batons as a majorette at Elyria High School, Ms. Brinda earned a journalism degree at Ohio State University in Columbus but returned for a copywriting job at a local radio station. That is where she met her husband, Greg Brinda, who would go on to become a Cleveland radio sports personality. His courtship included lunches in Ely Square, by the fountain, where they imagined a shared future.
She helped to raise a family, went to graduate school, held several management jobs and served as the school board president. Then, last year, she was elected mayor on the implied promise to restore some of the grandeur depicted in her late father's vast collection of Elyria postcards.
''This was a destination place,'' she recalls him proudly telling her.
The mayor has kept those books of postcards. ''And before I'm through,'' she says, ''I'm going to create a new postcard for the city of Elyria.''
But the Elyria she inherited had lost most of its manufacturing base over the years. Then came the recent recession to smother any shoots of recovery. Income tax revenues dropped, the state reduced financing to local governments and the state's estate tax was repealed, meaning that the Elyrias of Ohio will soon be operating with even less money.
The resultant casualties included amenities that once fueled Elyrian pride. No Fourth of July fireworks to blow holes in the night sky. No winter festival of lights at Finwood Estate to bedazzle the children. No park rangers patrolling Cascade Park. No forester. No cemetery supervisor.
Now, Frank Gustoff, the parks and recreation director, is also responsible for the city's trees and cemeteries. ''One day I'm teaching a 4-year-old how to play soccer,'' he says. ''The next day I'm carrying a casket, and the next I'm inspecting a tree.''
In other words, he says, ''From tots to plots.''
Faded Glory
Heading south on Middle Avenue, Mayor Brinda passes the old Lorain County Courthouse, a stately sandstone building from 1881 that is featured in so many old postcards. But the business of law moved years ago to a new building, and now the old courthouse sits underused and slipping into disrepair.
The mayor, though, is considering the county's offer to lease the building to the city for $1. Maybe its practical grandeur could be restored one day as, say, a cultural center for the display of local artwork.
''It bothers me that the building is being allowed to go,'' she says, sounding a familiar theme.
She points proudly to the just-renovated Elyria High School, her alma mater, whose teams and marching band still elicit shouts of ''Go Pioneers!'' But more than two-thirds of the city's children in public schools receive free or discounted meals -- a drastic increase in recent years, she says, that reflects the steady shrinking of the middle class.
''Parents of the last generation were in a position to help their kids,'' the mayor says one day. ''And I think a lot of parents in my generation are just trying to figure out how to make it themselves.''
Not far from the high school is Ely Stadium, where Vic Janowicz dominated schoolboy football in the late 1940s, and where Ike Maxwell starred on a championship team in the early 1970s. Mr. Janowicz went on to play in the National Football League; Mr. Maxwell now walks the streets of Elyria shouting out complicated word puzzles that people struggle to solve.
The mayor's drive meanders through Elyria's highs and lows. Here are business anchors like the Ridge Tool Company, the precision-engineering giant Parker Hannifin, and Invacare, a leading maker of wheelchairs and other home-care products. Here is BASF Catalysts, which, thanks in part to a $24.6 million federal stimulus grant, is opening a plant to help in the making of lithium-ion batteries that, among other uses, power electric cars.
''Huge, huge, huge,'' the mayor says.
Unemployment here hovers near the national average of 7.8 percent, but the relatively low number provides spare comfort. ''The high-paying manufacturing jobs have been replaced by lower-paying retail and food-service jobs,'' she explains.
The BASF expansion, she says, is a step toward helping Elyria and the rest of northeast Ohio find a marketable niche, in concert with her hope to attract businesses interested in sustainability, establish a local job-creation tax credit and hire an economic development director. ''It takes years, but we are doing some things,'' she says.
The mayor drives on. Here are the stately historic homes along Washington Avenue, and the upper-middle-class neighborhoods like Overbrook and University Oaks. Here, too, are the poor and working-class neighborhoods, plagued by foreclosure.
Here is the nationally respected EMH Elyria Medical Center, built by a grief-stricken community a century ago after a trolley accident killed nine, injured dozens and highlighted the absence of a city hospital. And here is the bone-white Y.M.C.A. building, built in the early 1960s and shuttered since 2006.
The empty Y reflects the diminishing presence of the business titans who once called Elyria home and whose philanthropy provided an extra revenue stream when, say, the need for a hospital arose. That sense of ownership is no longer as strong, since most of the corporate leaders no longer live here.
But, she quickly adds, the global companies and the small businesses, the Rotary and the Kiwanis still rise to the moment. They chipped in for $1.2 million of various improvements at the high school that were not covered by public financing. They raised $60,000 for a day camp that provided summer activities for 500 children.
And the mayor hopes they will support her latest campaign: to raise enough money to restore the Elyrian traditions of holiday light displays at Finwood Estate and Ely Square.
For $25, you're a ''sugar plum'' donor; for $5,000, you're ''silver and gold.''
Reimagining Downtown
Finally, the mayor turns onto Broad Street, the commercial thoroughfare of downtown Elyria that most challenges the communal imagination. If it is true, as she likes to say, that a healthy city requires a healthy downtown, then the patient is sick.
The uneasy emptiness of the storefronts along Broad Street is interrupted here and there by an office or two, a bar or two, a furniture store, a tattoo parlor, a strip club. The buildings, many from the 19th century, seem to rest in a movie-set state of pause, as if waiting for someone to call ''Action!''
''You kind of see remnants of greatness,'' Ms. Brinda says. That kind of greatness once known to the retirees of the Breakfast Club who meet every morning down at Donna's, just around the corner. A greatness that slipped away as the Midway Mall opened on the city's outskirts in the 1960s, as the General Motors plant shut down in the 1980s, as the makers of springs and bolts and other things went away.
A faint seediness has replaced the greatness. But just as Mayor Brinda has hope for the old courthouse, so too does she harbor hope for downtown.
Beyond working with volunteers to provide flower baskets and other aesthetic touches that the city can no longer afford, she is talking with urban planners about developing a mixed-used strategy -- through creating tax breaks, maybe, or special-improvement districts, or working with the medical center to find housing for its work force in these historic buildings.
''It's a way to start,'' she says. But sometimes Elyria gets in its own way.
Forty years ago, the city moved out of the old, inadequate City Hall on Ely Square and into a Broad Street building that the Sears department store had abandoned for the Midway Mall. But it returned a few years ago to the newly restored City Hall, and the Sears building was emptied and mostly forgotten.
That is until Mayor Brinda learned shortly after taking office in January that her administration had inherited a crisis: the neglected and now-unstable Sears building. Among other problems, rainwater had been pouring for who knows how long through a hole in the roof and down three stories to the basement, flooding the adjacent buildings and causing wholesale rot.
City workers in hazmat suits returned from an expedition into the building with photographs of black mold covering everything from municipal records to solid-wood furniture. ''Rotted from the inside out,'' recalls Mary Siwierka, the city's safety service director.
By its own neglect, then, the City of Elyria had contributed to the ruination of the very downtown it was forever trying to revive. The city had no choice but to condemn its own building, which it must now demolish before the structure collapses onto Broad Street.
Estimated cost: up to $600,000 that the mayor would have preferred to spend in other ways. And this doesn't include what might have to be paid to the owners of the adjacent buildings.
Mayor Brinda reluctantly accepts that most residents will not care that the damage occurred before she took office. In the end, she says, ''I am The City.''
Not long ago, Ms. Brinda attended a function at the renovated train station, which is formally called a transportation center but with no passenger trains and not many buses could more accurately be described as a glorified catering hall. For many years, her grandfather had been a ticket seller and a train dispatcher in this building, giving voice to a community's vitality.
''So I'm sitting there at the table, talking to these people, and they're just marveling at this building,'' she recalls one day. ''And I couldn't help but think about him sitting there, and, um. ... ''
Her voice breaks.
''And how great it could still be.''
Bearing Witness
An Elyrian wedding continues in the sun-dappled gazebo of Ely Square, where the officiant, Mayor Holly Brinda, seems at ease in the park where she was once courted by the man who became her husband.
To her left is Donna's Diner, where she gets her bacon-lettuce-and-tomato sandwiches topped by a fried egg. To her right is the restored City Hall, where she can hear the evening songs of nearby church bells. Behind her is the park fountain, which adorns more than a few of her father's beloved postcards.
A new postcard for Elyria. So much to do.
But first the mayor of Elyria asks, ''As we stand here today as witness to this union, is there anyone present who knows of any reason why we may not legally continue with this wedding?''
And someone shouts, ''Absolutely not!''
Donna's Diner: Articles in this series are examining the expectations, disappointments and challenges that shape the lives of Donna Dove, her customers and the city they know intimately, Elyria, Ohio.

VINTAGE POSTCARDS: People used to send postcards from Elyria, Ohio, and Mayor Holly Brinda inherited her father's beloved collection of them. ''This was a destination place,'' she recalls him saying.
A DOWNTOWN WEDDING: In June, Mayor Brinda officiated at the wedding of Gregory Wallhead and Ashley Miller in Ely Square Park. Ms. Brinda, who took office on Jan. 1, has discovered that managing an American municipality in 2012 can sometimes seem like one protracted dare to fail.

HEADLINE: North Koreans See Few Gains Below Top Tier

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Su-Hyun Lee contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea.

 BODY:
DANDONG, China -- On her weekly shopping trips to downtown Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, a 52-year-old pig farmer who gave her name as Mrs. Kim tries to ignore the dusting of prosperity that has begun to transform the city in recent years: the newly built apartment blocks, the increasing number of Mercedes-Benzes that zip along once-empty boulevards, the smartly dressed young women who conspicuously gab on their newly acquired cellphones. She has never been to the Rungna People's Pleasure Ground, a new amusement park where children of the elite howled with delight this summer as they shot down a waterslide.
''Why would I care about the new clothing of government officials and their children when I can't feed my family?'' she asked tartly, wringing her hands as she recounted the chronic malnutrition that has sickened her two sons and taken the lives of less-well-off neighbors.
In the 10 months since Kim Jong-un took the reins of his desperately poor nation following the death of his autocratic father, North Korea -- or at least its capital -- has acquired more of the trappings of a functioning society, say diplomats, aid groups and academics who have visited in recent months. 
But in rare interviews this month with four North Koreans in this border city on government-sanctioned stays, they said that at least so far, they have not felt any improvements in their lives since the installment last December of their youthful leader -- a sentiment activists and analysts say they have also heard. In fact, the North Koreans said, their lives have gotten harder, despite Mr. Kim's tantalizing pronouncements about boosting people's livelihoods that have fueled outside hopes that the nuclear-armed nation might ease its economically ruinous obsession with military hardware and dabble in Chinese-style market reforms.
Food prices have spiked, the result of drought and North Korea's defiant launching of a rocket in April that shut down new offers of food aid from the United States. Development organizations also blame speculators who have hoarded staples in anticipation of reforms that have yet to materialize. The price of rice has doubled since early summer, and chronic shortages of fuel, electricity and raw materials continue to idle most factories, leaving millions unemployed.
''People were hopeful that Kim Jong-un would make our lives better, but so far they are disappointed,'' said a 50-year-old named Mrs. Park, who like Mrs. Kim spoke on the condition that only her last name be used, fearing retribution when she returned home.
A member of the ruling Workers' Party from a major city, Mrs. Park said that to feed her family, she sells cornmeal cakes from a market stall, but she complained of sluggish sales and famished children who snatch her wares from beneath a protective swatch of fabric. More than once this year, she said she walked by the lifeless bodies of those who were too weak to steal.
''I would have given them food if I had any,'' she said, looking away with shame.
What has become clear in recent months is that Mr. Kim is intent on a new leadership style -- allowing more women to dress in Western wear that had long been branded a capitalist affectation, and breaking with tradition by publicly admitting a failure when the much ballyhooed rocket launch went awry. What is less clear is whether he will allow more than the baby steps toward economic reform that he is reported to have taken.
Those changes include a pilot project that North Korean defector groups say was introduced last spring that aims to let farmers keep 30 percent of their yield. The government has reportedly begun a guest-worker program, with the goal of giving thousands a chance to earn foreign currency in and around Dandong, a booming city that taunts hungry North Koreans across the Yalu River with its neon-lit barbecue restaurants.
In interviews with the four North Koreans, though, optimism was in short supply. Emaciated beggars haunt train stations, they said, while well-connected businessmen continue to grow rich from trading with China and government officials flourish by collecting fines and bribes.
They were all anxious about speaking out; the gulag awaits those who speak to journalists or Christian missionaries, they were warned during two-day orientations that preceded their departure. ''If the government finds out I am reading the Bible, I'm dead,'' one woman said.
Heightened security on both sides of the border since Mr. Kim took power has made sneaking into China much harder than in recent years; activists who help ferry refugees to freedom in South Korea say sweeps by Chinese police and a crackdown on North Korean smugglers who guide the way to the border has reduced to a trickle those who try to leave.
Even if their lives are stalked by deprivation and a fear of North Korea's omnipresent security apparatus, the people who made it to Dandong are a privileged lot: all of them arrived on two-month visas that let them visit relatives here -- allowing their government to charge steep fees that bring it much-needed foreign currency. All of them said they overstayed their visas in the hope they might earn enough money in Chinese factories or breweries to feed their families and repay black market loans that financed the official paperwork.
With little information seeping out of the tightly controlled police state, their accounts, told from a safe house rented by a Christian group, provided a glimpse into how North Koreans are living under the reign of Mr. Kim, whose family has ruled the country for decades.
Although it is possible the North Koreans interviewed are more disenchanted than others -- given their affiliation with Christians, who are generally very critical of the Communist state -- their accounts, told separately, largely dovetailed with one another's and with the assessments offered by foreign aid workers and academics who recently spent time in the country.
Daniel Pinkston, a North Korea expert with the International Crisis Group, said much of the talk about change was fueled by Mr. Kim's pronouncements about improving the standard of living and a public persona that appears far more amiable than his mirthless father, Kim Jong-il, whose disastrous economic policies helped produce a famine in the 1990s that claimed as many as two million lives.
''People leapt to very sweeping conclusions about reform, but it's not a switch that happens in a day,'' said Mr. Pinkston, who visited North Korea this summer. ''On the other hand, the privileged few who have a monopoly on certain sectors are making out like bandits.''
In two days of interviews with the North Koreans, a thinly concealed disgust over inequality that has risen in recent years -- and a realization that the national credo of juche, or self-reliance, was a carefully constructed lie -- was striking. While such feelings appear to be fed by the creeping availability of at least some information from the outside world, disillusionment mounted last spring after the government's promised era of prosperity, slated to begin in April, went unfulfilled. The discontent seemed to solidify with the government's rare admission of the failed rocket launching.
''We were led to believe that even dogs would eat rice cakes in 2012,'' said Mrs. Kim, the pig farmer. Asked if she thought there were those who still believed in North Korea's Stalinist, brutally enforced single-party system, she shook her head and said ''zero.''
She and the others suggested that the information vacuum had been eased by the spread of cellphones (though sanctioned phones cannot call outside the country) and by South Korean soap operas that are smuggled across the border and secretly viewed despite the threat of prison. A 58-year-old retired truck driver from Sunchon, a city north of the capital, said he and his family locked their doors and covered their windows when watching the DVDs that offered glimpses of well-stocked supermarkets and glittering shopping malls.
''I wish we could have such a clean, shiny life,'' he said, adding that few people he knows still believe the government propaganda that paints South Korea as far more impoverished than the North.
While he and the other North Koreans are not foolish enough to openly question their leaders at home, their personal reactions to the death of their former leader last December were telling. Upon hearing the news, Mrs. Kim instinctively bought a bouquet of white flowers and headed to a local government building, where throngs wailed before a large portrait of their Dear Leader. Mrs. Kim followed their lead, but admitted that her tears were not genuine.
At home, she has precious little time to think about politics. She wakes up each day at dawn to scavenge for edible greens, then returns home to tend the family's pigs. Her other vocation, carried out in secret, is making homemade spirits, brewed from acorns and corn cobs, that she sells to wholesalers.
But the two enterprises barely provide sustenance for her husband and sons. The family subsists on the greens, cornmeal porridge and the occasional potato or radish. Food shortages are so widespread that one son had to return home from the military because he was ill. (His doctors at home say he was starving.)
Escaping hunger by illegally crossing into China appears to be less viable since Mr. Kim came to power. According to South Korean officials, the number of defectors who arrived there after traveling through China had dropped to 751 during the first six months of 2012, a 42 percent decline from the same period last year.
Such figures do not tell the whole story, since it can take months or even years for refugees to earn enough to travel to South Korea, but rights advocates say the border has become increasingly impenetrable.
The North Korean government has recently erected miles of electrified fencing at the border and sent as many as 20,000 additional guards, according to Open Radio for North Korea, which is based in South Korea, but has contacts in the North. In recent months, the Chinese government has also begun a crackdown on defectors who live in the three provinces closest to North Korea. Rights advocates say those caught are deported to North Korea, where they often face imprisonment.
Kim Tae-jin, the president of Free NK Gulag, an activist group in Seoul, said defectors living in the South have been finding it nearly impossible to reach the ''escape brokers'' who can bring a relative to freedom, for a steep fee. ''Before, the brokers used to be lined up near the border, but I think most of them have been caught,'' said Mr. Kim, who himself defected.
The lucky few who make it to Dandong are stunned by what they find: the car-choked streets, hot showers and the ability to speak out without fear. But mostly, they are overwhelmed by the array and abundance of inexpensive food. While her compatriots said they stuffed themselves with meat-filled dumplings and rice, Mrs. Kim ate only apples for the first five days. She said she had not eaten them since childhood.
''I thought our country lived well,'' she said, ''but I was mistaken.''

HEADLINE: The Speculators Win a Round

 BODY:
The foes of Dodd-Frank financial reform scored a victory recently when a federal court overturned a new rule to limit speculative trading in derivatives.
If allowed to stand, the ruling will leave the economy exposed to continued distortions because derivatives are easily deployed as tools for vast speculation. When the bets pay off, the result is lush bank profits. When they crater, as they did during the financial crisis, the result is bailouts. Either way, Wall Street wins and everyone else loses. 
The recent case, brought by trade groups for the banks, was filed against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is charged with writing and enforcing many of the derivative reforms in the Dodd-Frank law. The groups took aim at the C.F.T.C.'s attempt to impose ''position limits,'' or caps, on the number of derivative contracts a trader can hold on commodities like oil, food and metals. The Dodd-Frank law called for caps because without them, excess speculation drives up the prices of gas, food and other everyday products and services.
The industry groups did not dispute the rule on its merits; they said it was invalid because the agency had not followed proper procedures in issuing it. The C.F.T.C. countered that the law explicitly required it to establish position limits and imposed no special procedures. Judge Robert Wilkins of Federal District Court said the law ''is ambiguous'' on procedural issues and threw out the rule, saying the agency did not have a clear mandate to act.
The defeat is also disturbing because it will embolden banks to challenge other new rules. Commodity derivatives are a relatively small part of Wall Street's derivatives business. Rules to regulate financial derivatives, like credit default swaps, have yet to be completed.
In a welcome move last week, the C.F.T.C.'s general counsel recommended appealing the ruling, and the commission's chairman, Gary Gensler, agreed. But appealing is also risky, since the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., that would hear the case is notorious for an antiregulatory bias.
For that reason, it also would make good strategic sense for the agency to proceed with reissuing the rules, following the procedures that the banks contend were violated. Though that adds another burden to an overworked agency, it would help to ensure that desperately needed rules will, one way or another, be put in place.

HEADLINE: Sick Leave in New York

 BODY:
The arrival of flu season is a reminder that New York City has no law requiring employers to provide paid sick leave and that the City Council should pass one. Connecticut requires paid sick leave from most companies with more than 50 employees. Seattle, San Francisco and Washington all require employers to provide sick leave, and workers in New York deserve the same benefit. 
The two main obstacles to a sick leave bill are Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Speaker Christine Quinn. Both argue that such a change should not be required during bad economic times, even though there is little evidence that sick-leave requirements have hurt job markets elsewhere. Most business advocates are strongly opposed. Their voices are being heard over those of the 1.2 million workers who would benefit.
A bill offered by Councilwoman Gale Brewer would provide five sick days for employees of companies with 5 to 19 workers and nine sick days for bigger companies. Ms. Quinn has not brought this to a vote. A compromise proposal from Councilman Daniel Garodnick requires all companies with more than five employees to offer five paid sick leave days or flexible vacation days a year. His bill would also allow restaurant workers to ''swap'' shifts or take sick days, and excludes seasonal workers who are employed for less than 120 days.
The mayor might veto whatever bill emerges, but with so many council members in favor of sick leave, he would probably be overridden. It is Ms. Quinn who is standing in the way. As leader of a Council that clearly wants this change, it is her duty to allow a vote or help come up with a reasonable compromise. The best answer, of course, would be a Congressional law requiring sick leave benefits for the whole country. But the city cannot wait for a national policy that could be a long time coming.
