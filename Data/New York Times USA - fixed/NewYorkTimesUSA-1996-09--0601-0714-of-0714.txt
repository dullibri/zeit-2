HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DEMOCRAT;
For All of His Admonitions, Clinton Shows Ebullient Side

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 25

 BODY:
President Clinton has issued standing orders to his staff that overconfidence is the cardinal sin of front-running campaigns, and he tries hard to honor that dictum as he swoops around the country, striving to squeeze an extra hour of sunlight from the shortening days of fall.
"This is no time for complacency in the political campaign," the President told a Democratic Party fund-raising reception here this afternoon. "Believe me, it is not over. In some ways, it may be just about to begin." 
 But occasionally Mr. Clinton cannot quite help himself and gives in to his own upbeat mood, as he did this morning at Robert Morris College in Coraopolis, Pa., outside Pittsburgh.
His stated agenda was the official announcement introducing an inflation-proof Government bond, the latest in a series of modest proposals for the middle class.
But the President's broader business was a reverie on the boundless future he sees ahead with himself in continued charge, and the work he wants yet to do.
"Four years ago, just before the Presidential election, I came to Pittsburgh," Mr. Clinton told the students, "and said that I had entered that campaign because -- and I'd like to quote -- I didn't want my daughter to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents, because I knew we could do better with more opportunity and more responsibility and a stronger American community.
"Well, today I'm here to tell you that I'm not worried about that anymore, because America is on the right track and our children are going to do better."
The President went on to sketch a glimmering vision of expanding global markets, rising exports, increased access to education, a robotic mission to Mars, expanded health insurance coverage, a higher minimum wage, better job training and research advances that "will one day in the not-too-distant future enable every set of parents that has a little baby to get a map of the genetic structure of their child."
Mr. Clinton's latest prescription was the issuance of new Treasury bonds that will guard against inflation by tying their principal, and so their total return, to the Consumer Price Index.
The Treasury, which had considered the idea for years, announced in May that it planned to offer such bonds. Today Mr. Clinton simply re-announced the plan, fleshing out some details, in this electoral swing state where polls show him well ahead.
The new bonds are to be issued starting in January, in denominations as low as $1,000. By the following January, the Treasury is to offer as well a new inflation-protection savings bond, in amounts as small as $50.
The Dole campaign promptly dismissed the idea.
"You'd need a microscope and a pair of tweezers to find Bill Clinton's vision for a second term," said a Dole spokeswoman, Christina Martin. "Rather than acknowledge his true liberal plans to increase taxes and raise spending, Clinton is trying to hide behind an ever-increasing heap of mini-proposals that would expand the size and scope of government one inch at a time."
Sparring erupted, too, over terms for the second scheduled Presidential debate, a town-hall-style encounter in San Diego on Oct. 16.
The Clinton campaign spokesman, Joe Lockhart, accused the Dole campaign of a last-minute balking at a final agreement embodying terms decided by both camps last weekend. For its part, Mr. Dole's organization said it simply wanted a lectern that would help the nominee, his right arm disabled by war wounds, to take notes, and that it was proposing to move the start of the debate to 7 P.M., Eastern daylight time, from 9, so as not to conflict with any baseball playoff game that might be played that night, starting shortly after 8.
But Mr. Lockhart said the Clinton camp had warned of a possible baseball conflict in the original negotiations and had also agreed to allow candidates to use a "three-sided structure" to hold notes, a structure to be designed by the sponsoring Commission on Presidential Debates.
Asked as he walked down Locust Street here this evening with Mayor Edward G. Rendell whether he thought Mr. Dole did not want to debate, Mr. Clinton smiled and said: "There'll be debates. I'm sure of it."

HEADLINE: Liberties;
Slouching Toward Hartford

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS

 BODY:
There is a fatalistic splendor to Bob Dole's campaign.
It isn't even really a campaign anymore. It's something more interesting, more absurd, more dark, an inarticulate slouching around cornfields in Ohio and half-empty gyms in Missouri, boldly courting bad luck, bad timing and bad metaphors, inexorably sound-biting itself toward doom. 
 The candidate who swallows, mutters and subverts his words is now totally dependent on a good performance in a debate in Hartford. He is so opaque that the reporters were arguing the other day about whether Mr. Dole was ranting about taxes on "bird seed" or "bird feed."
The campaign is still struggling to master the basics -- who they could get to write some good speeches, how they should handle the local press.
As he has since Iowa last winter, the more Mr. Dole campaigns, the more voters he drives away. He's hurting Republican chances of holding the House and Senate. He's losing Reagan Democrats. He's threatening his party with a historic rout. But that's not the weird part. The weird part is that he's not panicking. Clinically speaking, the Republican candidate is a perfect illustration of what a famous predecessor of Freud's once described as "the lovely indifference of hysterics" -- except that Bob Dole's indifference is sometimes unlovely.
He will give up leisurely wooing the G.O.P. base this week to spend several days tanning in Florida. (He's tanned, he's rested, he's losing.)
Consider yesterday's odd little rally at St. Louis University here. Mr. Dole's introductory music was "Play That Funky Music, White Boy" and the Beatles' "Tax Man." A Dole advance man in the back sent up a few wistful puffs from a little smoke-blowing machine. And a student in front of Mr. Dole waved a sign -- "Kemp's the Dude."
This is the sort of campaign where Mr. Dole, asked about Democratic "lies," detours to give Phil Gramm a little whack. "Phil Gramm says we've got to start pulling this wagon," he said. "Well, he didn't quite make it up the hill. So I got the wagon now, and I'm working on it."
This is the sort of campaign where Mr. Dole, trying to tar Bill Clinton as a liberal who wanted tax increases and bigger government, somehow ends up defending him as a steadfast man of principle. "These are not the actions of a finger-in-the-wind politician that's waiting for the polls," he said of the finger-in-the-wind President who's always waiting for the polls. (A headline in The Washington Post on Tuesday announced, "Clinton Says He Is No Liberal.")
Nothing is resonating -- the attacks on the President's character, on his liberalism, on his wife and her "power grab on health care" and on the inane inhaling-not inhaling question. It's not entirely the Dole campaign's fault. Bill Clinton presents a target unprecedented in American politics: a perpetual-motion machine, moving left, right and center, signing bills to please one constituency and promising to fix the bills he just signed to please another constituency.
Republicans just shrug, waiting for the end. Robert Teeter, the Michigan pollster who helped manage the last disastrous Republican race, Bush '92, came to see Mr. Dole's speech to the Economic Club of Detroit. He said afterward that perhaps the public saw Mr. Dole for too many years from the vantage point of looking down at his forehead on C-Span, as he presided over Senate floor fights. "The public doesn't like all that fighting," Mr. Teeter said.
It is a little poignant to watch, this lion-in-autumn performance by a man who dedicated his life to public service. There are affecting moments.
In Shelby, Ohio, Mr. Dole worked a rope line and a mother offered him her baby to hold.
"I'm afraid I might drop it," he said, but then gingerly cradled the baby in his left arm, with some help from a Secret Service agent.
Republicans wonder why Mr. Dole is so serene in the tumbrel. Why on earth did he want the nomination? Was it just for the sake of getting it, or keeping other people from having it?
He seems oddly resigned to his fate, losing to one more golden boy for whom he has little respect, losing to someone who didn't do it the hard way. That's how his story always ends, isn't it?

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE THIRD PARTY;
Perot Shifts Focus From the Presidency To Dole and Politics

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Barred from the Presidential debates and denied the prime-time television slots he wants for his lectures on public policy, Ross Perot has found a sharper focus for his 1996 campaign by once again running not so much for President as running against Washington political institutions, particularly Bob Dole.
In recent days, as he has fought for more television exposure and for a spot in the debates, Mr. Perot has taken on the the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates and the television networks. But he has singled out Mr. Dole, the Republican Presidential candidate, for criticism. 
 Even though, initially, President Clinton's representatives said they wanted Mr. Perot in at least one debate, negotiators for both the Clinton and Dole camps decided last Saturday night to exclude him. Nonetheless, on Sunday, it was Mr. Dole whom the Texan criticized several times on the NBC News program "Meet the Press."
In Mr. Perot's speech last night at St. Louis University, he ridiculed Mr. Dole's 15 percent tax cut plan without mentioning his name. "Neither party is going to face the problems and if you just watch what they've been saying, you heard his speech here today," Mr. Perot said. Then Mr. Perot lowered his voice an octave or two, as if to mimick Mr. Dole, saying, " 'I'm going to cut your taxes, and I'm going to give you this, and I'm going to give you that, and you give me your vote in return.' And they must think you're really stupid."
And earlier today, before Mr. Perot arrived here for the speech this evening, his supporters sought to portray Mr. Dole as a coward for opposing Mr. Perot's inclusion in the debates. On "Meet the Press," Mr. Perot described Mr. Dole "as the point man in wanting to make sure that I had no voice at all" and later asserted that Mr. Dole's opposition would not play well with independent voters or Reform Party members meeting in caucuses to endorse Congressional candidates.
"See, Senator Dole did something really dumb politically," Mr. Perot said. "He poisoned the attitudes of millions of independent voters who put the Republicans in power in the House and Senate. I don't think it would have forever poisoned the environment in this world to have me involved in the debates."
Mr. Perot even pulled Mr. Dole's war record into the discussion.
"But Senator Dole for his own self-interest was willing to sacrifice the Senate and House races so he wouldn't have to confront me," he said. "Now here is a guy who is supposed to be a war hero. You'd think he'd be willing to stand up and talk to another person, wouldn't you?"
Still, even though Mr. Dole may have opposed Mr. Perot's inclusion in the debates, it is the television networks and the debate commission that are the Reform candidate's main obstacles in getting his message across.
On Tuesday Mr. Perot asked the Federal Communications Commission to find that by refusing to sell him weekly 30-minute blocks in prime time, the networks had violated Federal rules guaranteeing candidates "reasonable access" to the broadcast system. He also argues that the networks violated the equal-time rule by not letting him buy 45-minute slots immediately after the Presidential and Vice-Presidential debates set for next month.
On Monday Mr. Perot sued the debate commission in Federal court, seeking to be included in the forums, or have them canceled.
"The Democratic and Republican parties should not be permitted to consolidate their monopoly on the political process by closing off the Presidential debates," Mr. Perot's lawsuit says, warning that excluding him "will only deepen the nation's cynicism about government."
This sharpened attack on politics in general, echoing themes from Mr. Perot's 1992 campaign, has led some analysts to question whether Mr. Perot's candidacy is taking a back seat to his broader goals of conducting a national television teach-in on his favorite issues, and building the Reform Party that he founded and financed into a truly competitive alternative to the major parties.
"I have never thought that Perot had a serious chance with the economy as strong as it is of actually winning the Presidency," said Gordon Black, a pollster and Perot adviser in 1992 who talks periodically with Mr. Perot's aides. "I have thought from the beginning that Perot could in fact educate the American people in such a way that it would fundamentally alter our direction in politics."
Indeed, on "Meet the Press" on Sunday, Mr. Perot discussed party building. He predicted that his candidacy could capture 25 percent or more of the vote on Nov. 5. This, he said, would give the Reform Party major-party status and more Federal money in 2000. It would, he added, also end the Democrats' and Republicans' ability "to punch us around" on access to the debates.
But Mr. Perot and his aides adamantly say that he is committed to winning the Presidency. "This is a very serious bid for the White House, $29 million in a two-month campaign," Russell J. Verney, the Reform Party's national coordinator, said recently. "We have ample money to run a competitive campaign and win. We're trying to demonstrate that you do not have to be independently wealthy to run in a new political party."
Because Mr. Perot has agreed to accept Federal money to run his campaign, he is limited in spending from his own fortune. Choosing to work within a finite budget, he is particularly interested in the free television exposure offered by the debates, as well as the legitimacy that being in the forums brings.
Indeed, for Mr. Perot, who sparingly goes out on the stump to mingle with voters, television exposure from debates and "infomercials" are his candidacy's primary oxygen source.
The debate commission's decision may be causing Mr. Perot to have second thoughts about how he decided to finance his campaign. In August he said he would accept $29 million in Federal money, and limit his spending to that amount plus whatever else he can raise in individual contributions of up to $1,000 each. He also said he would not accept donations from political action committees. Sometime this week, Mr. Verney said, Mr. Perot will ask the Federal Election Commission to waive its $50,000 limit on what a candidate may contribute from his own resources because, he said, the debate commission has put Mr. Perot at a disadvantage.
How Mr. Perot's efforts play with voters this year remains to be seen. But with the level of anxiety over the economy lower than in 1992, he is facing a fundamentally different electorate.
Most of the 1996 electorate is not shopping for an alternative candidate, said Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research and public policy group in Washington.
"They might have looked for a centrist last November," he said. "But I don't think they are looking for an outsider right now. They are looking for somebody who can capably handle the affairs of state right now."
Mr. Gans describes the 1996 election as one in which voters believe they cannot "waste" their vote. Those who "dislike and mistrust" Mr. Clinton, he said, will vote for Mr. Dole. And those who are afraid of the "the Tom DeLay-Dick Armey freshman type of Republicanism," he said, referring to two members of the Newt Gingrich team in the House, will vote for the President.

HEADLINE: EMPIRE BLUE CROSS SEEKING TO BECOME FOR-PROFIT GROUP

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, once one of the country's biggest insurers of last resort, plans to announce today that it will seek approval from New York State to become a for-profit company, bringing to a close its historic role as a safety net for the sickest people of the state.
To make the transformation, Empire would establish a charitable foundation to provide money to help the more than 2.5 million New York residents who do not have health insurance. 
 The planned conversion reflects the fierce competition in the health care market. With the deregulation of hospital rates in the state, Empire is losing the special treatment that was supposed to subsidize its unprofitable coverage of many people with no place else to go. To stay alive, the company is trying to convert its traditional fee-for-service money-losing business to managed care organizations, which can charge customers less but have little left over for social obligations.
For the tens of thousands of people who buy coverage from Empire as individuals, rather than through their employers, a conversion to a for-profit company would push them into health maintenance organizations, in which their health care options would be limited. Empire said that its 850 subscribers who are permanently disabled would continue to be covered under the plan.
The company said it planned to hold public hearings on the conversion to for-profit status before seeking approval from the state Insurance Department, which had already paved the way for changing Empire's rapidly growing managed health care business to a for-profit division. Approval is also required from the Attorney General, the State Supreme Court and the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission.
Under the conversion plan, the foundation would initially own 100 percent of the stock in the new for-profit Empire and over the next five years would sell almost all its holdings. The sales would establish a market value for the company, which could be far higher than Empire's current book value of $300 million. Empire executives said they would issue more stock later and sell it to the public to raise money to expand the company's business.
"We would get capital to invest in technology and partnerships with the best doctors and hospitals," said Dr. Michael A. Stocker, the president and chief executive of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. "For the consumer, that would bring lower costs, improved service and state of the art products."
Consumer advocates were generally positive when told of Empire's plans yesterday.
"The challenge for consumer groups now is to see if Empire's conversion plan fits the public good and to help to flesh it out in defining the mission of the foundation," said Mark Scherzer, president of New Yorkers for Accessible Health Coverage, a coalition of voluntary health organizations with support from nurses and social workers.
Blue Cross companies in half a dozen states have changed partly or totally to for-profit status, and a few -- notably in California, Indiana, Wisconsin and Missouri -- have issued stock to public shareholders.
Moving to avert controversies that have delayed similar conversion plans by Blue Cross companies in Ohio and California, Empire said its executives would not receive windfall payments in stock or cash in the change-over.
Dr. Stocker said Empire's proposal "avoids many of the pitfalls experienced by other Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and recognizes the public's investment in Empire over the years."
Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans were started in the Depression of the 1930's to help working people to pay hospitals and doctors. For decades Blues plans had little competition but in the 1980's and 1990's they lost millions of customers as many big companies eliminated jobs and turned to lower-priced managed care insurers to try to hold down medical-cost inflation.
In New York, Empire Blue Cross was a power in the state government for years but was slow to keep up with changes in health care economics as government regulations were lifted and marketplace forces took over. Amid ugly charges of corruption and mismanagement, Empire's top executives were displaced.
But the nonprofit company has recently emerged from a long decline. In the late 1980's it insured 11 million people, or about 60 percent of the state's population. It now has 4.7 million enrolled, of which 523,000 are in managed care plans -- health maintenance organizations, discount networks and combinations called point of service plans, which permit customers to go to any doctor or hospital if they pay for the privilege.
And in a promising sign for future profits, the number in managed care has grown by 34 percent, from 389,000 last Jan. 1, Dr. Stocker, the Empire chief, said.
A for-profit company would "add $7 million to New York State tax rolls," he added.
James A. Barba, president of Albany Medical Center and the chairman of a watchdog committee set up by the state to monitor Empire following reports of its mismanagement and heavy losses, said Dr. Stocker had told him about the planned announcement but that he had not had a chance to read it.
In March, the oversight committee said in a report to Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature that Empire Blue Cross was "a charitable asset that must be preserved" because it was created under the state's nonprofit corporation law.
"Our panel was very concerned about the value of the public asset," Mr. Barba said. "It sounds like this would effectively transfer that value to a not-for-profit that would have a defined social mission in health care. I like that."
Mr. Barba added, though, that he would suggest the charitable foundation be run by a board with a majority of directors who would not come from Empire.
Charles Bell, a spokesman for Consumer's Union, the advocacy group, said he was pleased that "Empire recognizes that its assets belong to the public." But he said it would be "a terrible conflict for Empire to retain control over how those assets would be managed and disbursed."
The company said that the foundation board would be independent but did not spell out the proposed membership. The national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association has threatened to revoke the rights to its famous trademarks and name from Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans if they change to control by outsiders.
After struggling over this issue with consumer groups and state officials, California Blue Cross finally agreed to establish two foundations with combined assets of $3.3 billion in cash and stock. Blue Cross executives kept control of the stock, while an independent board was named for a cash-rich sister foundation.

PRESIDENT CLINTON
 
Speaking yesterday at Robert Morris College in Coraopolis, Pa.:
"We have to continue to stay on the cutting edge of change. You should support an investment of an appropriate amount of your tax dollars in research and technology, because that is the key to our future. Let me give you some examples that I think you can all identify with. 
 "The Human Gene Project at the National Institutes of Health, also being supported in universities all across America, will one day in the not-too-distant future enable every set of parents that has a little baby to get a map of the genetic structure of their child. So if their child has a predisposition to a certain kind of illness or a certain kind of problem, or even to heart disease or stroke in the early 40's, they will be able to plan that child's life, that child's upbringing, to minimize the possibility of the child developing that illness or that predisposition, to organize the diet plan, the exercise plan, the medical treatment that would enable untold numbers of people to have far more full lives than would have been the case before. It will also create huge numbers of new, fascinating high-wage jobs that have not even been invented yet for people like the young people who go to Robert Morris."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: NEWS ANALYSIS;
A Muted Dole Persona

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Bob Dole is a rare bird among modern politicians. Most, with the help of hired troupes of packagers, strategists and pollsters, make themselves more attractive to the public at large than they are to insiders who know them well and understand their weaknesses as well as strengths.
With Mr. Dole, it is the other way around. 
 Ask legislators of either party, journalists who have covered him for many years, or other old Washington hands. Almost without exception, they will tell you that he is strong, decent, honest, a world-class legislative craftsman. When he retired from Capitol Hill, Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, described him as a man whose word could always be trusted, by friend or foe.
But as Mr. Dole campaigned again this week in states where he ought to be doing better than he is -- Michigan, Ohio, Missouri and Iowa -- it was clear that precious little of that respect has filtered through to voters, especially the swing voters so influential in Presidential elections. In polls and interviews beyond the Beltway, a startling number of them describe him as mean or vindictive, shifty, too old, inept.
"He reminds me of Barry Goldwater in 1964," said Robert Teeter, the Michigan consultant who helped guide George Bush's unsuccessful re-election bid in 1992. "People on the Hill liked Goldwater much more than Lyndon Johnson, including a lot of Democratic senators. They liked his humor and his charm. But the country as a whole saw him as an extremist, and he never had a chance."
Bob Dole would have faced a difficult race this year no matter what people thought about his personality. The nation is at peace, the economy reasonably strong, and he faces an incumbent -- no formula for easy electoral success.
Still, charm always counts for something in politics, and it may count for more in an election like this one, with few issues catching the public interest and a Democratic nominee, Bill Clinton, who throughout his career has used his own considerable charm as a life raft in the whirlpools of politics. Personality has certainly not worked to Mr. Dole's benefit in the contest to date.
Some senior Republicans think the public sees Mr. Dole as a man out of step with the times, a man known to most Americans not for patient backroom negotiations with Presidents and Democratic leaders in the Senate but for slashing, sometimes sarcastic speeches on the Senate floor, televised on C-Span, and for his often highly combative appearances over the years on the Sunday political talk shows.
He is known, in short, as a partisan, in a day when partisanship is unpopular, and as a Washington fixture, in a day when Washington is unpopular. People mention him in the same breath as Speaker Newt Gingrich, whom he resembles in neither style nor substance.
Mr. Dole's resignation from the Senate was supposed to change those perceptions, but it does not seem to have done so. Impressions built up over decades do not fade away in a matter of months. Another reason, perhaps, is that he has not really changed his approach. Understandably, given his many years in Congress, he retains the viewpoint of the lawmaker, even when he remembers to remind his audience that he is no longer a member of the Senate. He still talks about the tax problems of Subchapter-S corporations, which may produce knowing nods in the cloakroom but evoked only uncomprehending stares Tuesday in rural Shelby, Ohio.
He is no more the hail fellow, well met, than ever. He draws no strength from plunging into crowds, in the style of Bill Clinton or Robert F. Kennedy or Lyndon B. Johnson. To make things worse, he gives the impression of "a man in a box," as a staff member put it Tuesday, unable to be fully himself.
"Someone, I don't know who, has stripped Bob Dole of the things that made him appealing," a Midwestern Republican official said. "This was a man who got things done in Washington, who broke the logjams people hate. This was a man with a fine, ironic sense of humor, which he used to puncture stuffed shirts. But none of that shows up now."
When the Dole wit occasionally peeks through, audiences find it appealing. In Detroit, for example, a preliminary speaker made a remark about having recently made a dive in a Navy submarine. When his turn came, Mr. Dole could not resist commenting, "the last dive I took was that one out in Chico, Calif.," where he fell off a stage when a railing gave way. The audience laughed and clapped.
But there are few spontaneous wisecracks these days. The old iconoclasm about politics and politicians is muted, at least in public. And it is noticeable that Mr. Dole, a master of give-and-take with television questioners in his Senate days, gives few interviews to anchormen or radio talk-show hosts as he moves around the country. One theory among aides is that he was made gun-shy by the storm kicked up when he off-handedly questioned whether tobacco was addictive.
Whether as a result of his own decision, that of his advisers, or both, the Republican nominee has become almost bland -- the last thing anyone would have expected a year ago.
Mr. Dole seems uncomfortable talking about his wartime experiences, something that most men of his generation have avoided, especially those from his part of the country, the Great Plains, where real men are men of few words. For years he, too, avoided the subject. Yet now he mentions his wounds almost compulsively, in almost every speech, as if they are his only hope of establishing his bona fides in the brave new world where people touch and feel and share.
It is not much more successful than Adlai E. Stevenson's episodic efforts to shed his aristocratic skin and pose as a man of the people, or Hubert H. Humphrey's half-hearted attempts to play the Cold Warrior instead of the Happy Warrior, or Michael S. Dukakis's brief whirl in the turret of a tank.
The result is a campaign that for now at least lacks thrust and urgency. The schedule is slack. The speeches are full of inconsistencies. In Detroit, Mr. Dole spoke at the outset about an economy in tatters but at the end about the boom in Michigan (which is echoed throughout this region). At St. Louis University this morning, he lambasted President Clinton as "liberal, liberal, liberal," after spending weeks portraying him as a waffler without real convictions.
None of this is lost on his more perceptive aides, most of whom now regard the two nationally televised Presidential debates next month as his last best chance to "show people who he really is." That was to have been accomplished in the primaries; it was not. It was to have been accomplished at the convention; it was not. Now, in the words of one discouraged old friend, there are only six weeks left for "his simplicity and plainness of character to shine through."

Empire Blue Cross Plans To Seek For-Profit Status
Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York, one of the country's biggest nonprofit health care companies, said it would seek state approval to become a for-profit company that would no longer be the health insurer of last resort.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Daughter Feasting On Grief

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY 

 BODY:
GRIEF walks in circles in the National Theater of Greece's hypnotic interpretation of Sophocles' "Elektra." The emotion, like the tragedy's anger-shrouded heroine, traces an orbit of despair that seems as fixed, in its way, as the figures on Keats's urn.
In the title role, Lydia Koniordou moves in a repetitive, fluid path that corresponds to the oval of sand that dominates the stage at City Center, where the production (the company's first in New York in two decades) runs through Sunday. The play may end with the redressing of the past wrongs that have enslaved and embittered Elektra. But one leaves the theater with the sense that the chain of dark memories and lamentations can never really be broken. 
 More than any of the great plays of the classical Greek theater, "Elektra" is an anatomy of a single emotion. While it addresses the cycle of murder and retribution in the bloody House of Atreus covered by Aeschylus' and Euripides' versions of the same tale, its focus is far less on the horrific events of a legend than the way they have shaped one mind.
Much of the tragedy, accordingly, is a sustained, if diversely inflected, keen, like that of a woman at a wailing wall. The story of the unholy murder of Elektra's father, Agamemnon, by his wife, Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus, is told again and again. Elektra insists on it. "Can it be honorable to forget the dead?" she asks, in response to the admonitions of the chorus, which observes, quite justly, that this woman knows nothing of moderation.
"Elektra" has been a favorite vehicle for actresses of strapping bravery and ambition, most notably Katina Paxinou, the Greek actress best known here for her Oscar-winning performance in "For Whom the Bell Tolls." It is risky territory.
In uncertain hands, Elektra can seem like the kvetch of all times, tempting audiences to sympathize with the character's mother and sister and the chorus, who keep telling her what amounts to "Enough of the complaining already, honey." The challenge is in universalizing her monomania while holding on to her unique psychological strength.
Fortunately, mourning does indeed become this Elektra. Ms. Koniordou, who is also the show's director (in association with Dimitris Economou), has found a transfixing vitality in the part that speaks to everyone who believes that only remembrance can keep the dead alive.
Her life may have "gone by without hope," as she says, since the murder of her father in her childhood, but this is not a woman who has been stunted by grief. Indeed, she has feasted on it.
As Elektra alternates between contemplation of revenge and her own desired death, the commanding, large-boned Ms. Koniordou, all feverish eyes and knifelike gestures, seems only to grow in a perverse, superhuman willfulness. (Portraying her mother, Aspasia Papathanasiou seems to have shriveled inversely from fear and bitterness.)
Ms. Koniordou's performance and the production itself, although spoken in modern Greek, have a purely physical eloquence in which a harrowing ferocity of spirit is contained in ritualized movements. (On the other hand, the translated supertitles are bizarrely, even comically, clunky; you would definitely do well to read the play before seeing it.)
The sense of a circle, again, is crucial. As Elektra quarrels with her more practical, gentle-spirited sister, Chrysothemis (Tania Papadopoulou), and her tyrannical, conflicted mother, the women orbit each other in a slow, stately dance, maintaining an isolating distance.
The hems of their shawls and dresses (the striking, simple set and costumes are by Dionysis Fotopoulos) trace corresponding arcs in the sand. And when the pattern is broken, with the characters lunging into a fierce embrace or stranglehold, it is viscerally shocking.
The 17-woman chorus, meticulously choreographed by Apostolia Papadamaki, reinforces the same spiritual geometry, breaking and regrouping into curved or angled lines that suggest both awed timidity and the cohesiveness of a social order. There is mellifluous harmony and, at moments, confused dissonance in their collective voice. Before Elektra's imposing sorrow, they can reprove, recoil or console. They cannot, finally, assimilate it.
Takis Farazis's music, a primal, haunted blend of percussion and woodwinds, and the sung lamentations all feed into the sense of a world in which mourning and the hope of revenge have become in themselves a religion. Deliverance finally arrives, in the form of Elektra's long-exiled brother, Orestes (Miltos Dimoulis), and the rhythms speed up accordingly as the play gallops toward a blood-soaked denouement.
Actually, once the real action takes over in "Elektra," the production loses its grip. This is partly because the men -- who also include Stefanos Kyriakidis as Aegisthus and Alexandros Mylonas as Orestes' mentor -- don't really have characters to play. But one also suspects that Sophocles' greater interest was in the psychology of a woman who made a cult of her suffering.
This Elektra achieves her apotheosis not with the play's end, but when she is earlier told (falsely) that her brother has been killed. "Now all I hold is nothingness," says Elektra, her sculptural face gone hollow, and the circle of anguish in which she has been trapped seems frozen into eternity.

HEADLINE: In Defense Spending, How Much Is Too Much?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Tooth Fairy Defense Budgets" (Op-Ed, Sept. 25), Jonathan Rauch argues strongly against President Clinton's and Bob Dole's budget proposals because, after adjustment for inflation, they both imply cuts in future United States military spending. Mr. Rauch's arguments also have a "tooth fairy" quality, because they ignore important factors that must be considered as part of any rational military spending policy. 
 First, it must be noted that the United States, with a military budget in the neighborhood of $260 billion, is spending almost as much as it did at the peak of the cold war, when the Soviet Union was spending as much as we were, if not more. The cold war is over, the Soviet-East European bloc has been dismantled, and the Soviet Union itself has broken up. The military performance of Russia in Chechnya is a good indication that we have nothing to fear from this quarter.
Is $260 billion enough to meet our current military needs? One way of approaching this issue is to ask how much other nations are spending. According to The Defense Monitor, a newsletter published by the Center for Defense Information, the United States is spending almost as much as the combined military budgets of Japan, France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China, Italy, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. Certainly, this country has the greatest military superiority of any nation in modern times.
Another factor that is largely ignored by Mr. Rauch is that the United States has many important needs, currently unmet, that could be financed by reductions in military expenditures; to put this another way, increases in military spending lead to cuts in nonmilitary expenditures. In fact, Mr. Clinton's budget proposal for 1995 included more than $10 billion in such cuts. Limiting military spending makes sense in a nation that is near full employment and has a large budget deficit and an irrational bias against increasing taxes.

HEADLINE: Without Wall Street, There Is No Main Street

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In Russell Baker's Sept. 24 column on the end of the era of big government, he writes that "shrewd bottom-line guys will find a way to convert human misfortune into good numbers for Wall Street." This statement may be colorful for a columnist but is a serious disservice to the nation, its history and its attitudes. 
 Capitalism, or Wall Street as Mr. Baker calls it, has created a nation that has done more to solve the problems of human misfortune than any other nation in history. Problem-solving companies (financed by capitalists) have been created that have expanded the human potential, increased our longevity and enriched the daily experience of millions by virtue of the freedom provided by the free-market economic system we often carelessly take for granted.
The world is littered with well-meaning socialist or Communist countries that in their quest for utopian societies have left more misery in their wake. It is time for people like Mr. Baker to understand that Wall Street is really America's Main Street.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Swiss Rate Cut Weakens Mark And Drives Up Dollar's Value

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A surprisingly large cut in Swiss interest rates weakened the German mark yesterday, driving the dollar sharply higher.
Continuing improvement in the American bond market also contributed to the second consecutive strong showing for the dollar. It rebounded on Wednesday from a selloff the day before prompted by the Federal Reserve's decision not to raise interest rates. 
 Yesterday, the Swiss rate cut in particular created a big demand for dollars, as traders moved out of Swiss francs. Lower rates tend to diminish a currency's value. "People bought dollars in Europe and we followed through," said Peter Ullrich, vice president at Giro Credit Bank in New York. He said the Swiss move "really gave a turbo-boost to the dollar."
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.5233 marks, from 1.5156 marks on Wednesday. It also rose to 110.66 yen from 110.44 yen, and to 1.2528 Swiss francs from 1.2398 francs. They were the highest levels for the dollar since mid-July. The British pound ended unchanged at $1.5610, partly a result of the pound's own strength against the mark and other European currencies.
The Swiss central bank's half-percentage-point reduction in the discount rate put the key rate at 1 percent, the lowest in nearly two decades. The move was intended to help stimulate a lethargic economy.
But the move was also seen as a sign of broader economic trends suggesting that Switzerland's neighbors would have to eventually reduce interest rates, as well, to help improve growth. "I think this reaffirmed to traders that rates are going to be cut in Europe and that Germany will cut rates at some point," said Ralph Delzenero, vice president for foreign-exchange marketing at the First National Bank of Chicago. "Traders tend to forget they still have a recession over there."
The dollar received additional help yesterday from weakness in the mark over further evidence that plans for a single European currency beginning in 1999 would not be disrupted. The latest sign came from Trade Minister Augusto Fantozzi of Italy, who said his country's 1997 budget plans would help bring its deficit down to 3 percent of the gross domestic product, an important criterion for European countries to join in monetary union.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Post Increase For 4th Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices advanced for a fourth consecutive session yesterday, bolstered by a durable goods report that pointed to a slowing economy.
For a second full day after the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged, worries about higher rates were greatly eased in the market. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 17/32 , to 9811/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.88 percent, from 6.92 percent on Wednesday.
Bond prices were also bolstered by a Treasury five-year-note auction.
But prices were chiefly supported by a report showing orders for durable goods fell 3.1 percent in August, after rising a revised 1.4 percent in July. Without transportation, the durables orders were down 1.6 percent.
Traders said the decline was larger than the average economists had forecast, which was for a decline of three-tenths of a percent.
It left the impression that the large increase the market saw in July was a distortion and not a signal that the economy was strengthening. While the July report had raised worries that the economy was strengthening, yesterday's Commerce Department report dispelled fears.
"Although durable goods orders tend to be erratic, the signs of a manufacturing slowdown are emerging," said Kenneth J. McCarthy, head of the Economic Intelligence Company.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said "new orders for durable goods are still exhibiting healthy, moderate growth, but at the same time the trend is slowing, albeit at a very gradual pace."
The data appeared to confirm to many traders and analysts that the Federal Reserve took the right step in not raising rates.
"In this environment," Mr. McCarthy said, "it was certainly appropriate for the Fed to hold off increasing rates, and we expect that as more evidence of slow growth emerges in the next few months, the Fed will opt to leave rates unchanged in 1997."
But Mr. Fine said that he expected that Fed policy makers "most assuredly will maintain a bias toward tightening until conditions dictate otherwise."
"Indeed, the Fed still has its finger on the trigger as it hunts inflationary prey," he said.
The Treasury's $12.5 billion sale of new five-year notes went about as expected, traders said. The notes were awarded at a high yield of 6.409 percent, down from 6.568 percent in August and the lowest since April 24, when it was 6.279 percent.
The bid-to-cover ratio, or number of investors bidding for the issue compared with the total size of the sale, was above average at 2.57 to 1.
Damon Whelchel, an analyst with MMS International, San Francisco, said that before yesterday's auction the average bid-to-cover over the last 12 auctions was 2.41 to 1.
Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data, Boston, said, "With two auctions down, the markets are floating near the highs of the recent trading range."
Even though market sentiment has shifted, he said, the market will probably need some fresh news to push it higher. "Investors are generally reluctant to buy into strong rallies, so they have their fingers crossed for a bit of a backup into next week."
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new five-year notes:

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Reappointed, I.M.F. Chief Asks New Funds

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund's newly reappointed managing director, Michel Camdessus, presented a substantial shopping list for his organization today, asking for more than $100 billion in new money to enable the fund to safeguard an international financial system increasingly dominated by volatile capital flows.
But senior American monetary officials said his demands were far too ambitious and constituted an opening bid in the coming debate over increasing I.M.F. resources. Still, Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin said at a subsequent news conference that the Administration favored strengthening the fund so it would be better equipped to deal with future Mexico-type crises. 
 Mr. Camdessus, 63, a former French central bank governor who has just been given his third five-year term at the I.M.F.'s helm, said at his own news conference before the annual ministerial meetings of the fund and the World Bank here that he wanted the fund's 180 nations to double its $200 billion in capital -- or at a minimum, to increase it by 50 percent.
He also called for the creation of 26 billion new reserve units, or special drawing rights, with an approximate value of $36 billion. They would be distributed to members according to a formula favoring formerly Communist countries, which never received these assets. Both the increase in the I.M.F.'s capital and the drawing rights distribution are subject to approval by approval by Parliaments, which could take two years or more.
Mr. Camdessus stressed that I.M.F. lending to emerging and formerly Communist economies introducing market-oriented reforms had soared to $17.2 billion last year from $3.6 billion in 1989.
He said he was now confident that the I.M.F. would vote to sell as much as $2 billion worth of its gold to help provide debt relief for the poorest countries, if national contributions proved insufficient as he feared.
He recalled that the world's richest nations were currently doubling to $55 billion a special credit line they offer the I.M.F. in times of financial upheaval, known as the General Arrangement to Borrow.
Secretary Rubin, speaking in advance of Saturday's meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, said that his main concerns were to continue strengthening the international financial system and to encourage steady economic growth worldwide.
He said ministers would concentrate on the financial initiatives that Group of Seven heads of government had endorsed at their Naples and Halifax meetings in the last two years, intended to ward off new financial crises in the emerging economies and to encourage private investment.
This involves increasing the I.M.F.'s resources, improving disclosure so that markets are better informed about the finances of emerging economies, and strengthening regulatory authorities.
The debt-relief initiative has split the Group of Seven, with the United States, France, Britain and Canada favoring I.M.F. gold sales and Germany and Italy opposing them, contending that the sales would undermine the institution's credibility. Anticipating passage, Mr. Rubin said that once gold sales were agreed to, he would ask the United States Congress for a cash contribution, as well.
This is in line with Mr. Camdessus' original proposal that gold sales provide half the I.M.F. share of the plan's cost -- also being borne by the World Bank, with national contributions making up the rest.
Discussing growth, Mr. Rubin said Japan must maintain its economic recovery by increasing demand. And he said he wanted to review Europe's single-currency plan, which some economists consider deflationary.
The senior American monetary officials said Mr. Camdessus was asking more than Washington and other Group of Seven governments were likely to agree to. They said that a review of quotas and a special S.D.R. distribution had been accepted in principle but not in numerical detail.
And they recalled that at the I.M.F.'s 50th anniversary meeting in Madrid two years ago, Mr. Camdessus had split the members with a proposal to increase the fund's financial importance by allowing it to issue special drawing rights worth $53 billion. That plan -- while welcomed by poorer countries -- was vetoed as inflationary by the Group of Seven, which offered rights worth $23 billion instead.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: POLITICAL MEMO;
A Coattails Reversal From '94 Races

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
It may be hard to imagine given Bob Dole's standing in the polls, but a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate closed his television commercial with this tag line: "A majority of the time, I vote with the Republican leader, Bob Dole."
But that was 1994, when Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota and many other Democrats, were "running from Bill Clinton like scalded dogs," in the words of Haley Barbour, the Republican Party chairman. That year, at least, it was fashionable for Republicans (and at least one Democrat) to hitch their electoral fortunes to the then Senate minority leader, Mr. Dole, or the man who would be Speaker, Newt Gingrich. 
 Today, most Republican candidates never mention Mr. Gingrich and rarely boast about (let alone mention) the signature tax cut proposal of Mr. Dole, now their Presidential nominee. Democrats, meanwhile, are clamoring to be photographed beside President Clinton when he pays a visit to their area.
Politics, by nature, is a volatile business, but never in recent history has there been as stark a role reversal in the dynamic between Presidential and Congressional candidates as since the 1994 mid-term elections. The turnabout underscores how quickly voters' perceptions about their political leaders can change. But it also reflects a shift in how the parties are presenting themselves -- and the degree to which both sides may have overreacted in gauging the public's yearning for a Republican Congress that would pull the Government rightward.
Even in North Carolina, where Mr. Dole is ahead in the polls, many Republicans are not particularly eager to tie themselves to the man at the top of the ticket.
"I mean, this ain't Reagan running this year," Marc Rotterman, a Republican consultant who is handling two Congressional campaigns in the state, said the other day.
Just two years ago, Republican Congressional candidates were all too eager to promote their party's leaders, putting a national cast to their races and depicting Mr. Clinton as the villain. They also presented an issue agenda, the Contract With America. Democrats, meanwhile, ran their own races; even Mr. Clinton's pollster at the time, Stanley Greenberg, advised some Democrats against linking their own campaigns to the President.
This year, it is as if Republicans are heeding Mr. Greenberg's advice that "voters want to know that you are fighting to get things done for them, not that you are advancing some national agenda."
And, Democrats seem to be following Mr. Barbour's playbook from 1994, when he counseled Republican candidates that "the only way to change Washington is to change Congress." This year, when Mr. Clinton visits a town, there is hardly any room in the V.I.P. section, as Democrats who did not want to be seen near their President in 1994 squeeze next to him. Some Republicans -- all but given up on Mr. Dole's prospects -- are even assuring their constituents that they work well with the Democrat in the White House.
Another unexpected dynamic this year is the like-minded interests between Mr. Clinton and Republican Congressional candidates, with each offering themselves as a guard against the other. Even as Vice President Al Gore has been dispatched to attack the "Dole-Gingrich Congress," Mr. Clinton has founded much of his campaign on the notion that he provides a check on the conservative Congress. Just the same, Mr. Dole almost never utters the word "Gingrich" these days, and many Republican Congressional candidates, worried that Mr. Dole will lose, offer themselves as a check on the Democrat in the White House.
Brett Bader, a Republican consultant, said his party's Congressional candidates in Washington state will be most successful if they send the message, "If you are going to vote for Clinton, fine, but you are going to need someone to watch over him."
The altered dynamics make for an odd spectacle on the campaign trail; this year it is the Democrats who invoke Mr. Gingrich, while many Republicans insist that their races are being waged on local matters.
Perhaps the most obvious contrast is in Virginia, where just last year, Republican candidates for the state legislature sought to repeat their party's national success in 1994. Emulating the House Republicans' contract, candidates in the Old Dominion campaigned on a "Pledge for Honest Change," which called for welfare reform and cuts in taxes and spending. Mr. Clinton was so anathema in the state that Democratic candidates pointedly called themselves "Virginia" Democrats -- or advertised no party at all.
But the Republicans failed in their bid to take over the legislature. And this year, with polls showing that Mr. Clinton has a respectable shot at becoming the first Democratic nominee to win Virginia since 1964, he is now the surprising new running mate for several of the state's Democratic Congressional contenders.
Tom Horton, a Democratic candidate for Congress in the Washington suburb of Springfield, sent out a flyer last week featuring a photograph of himself with Mr. Clinton at the White House. His opponent, Representative Tom Davis, a freshman, is keeping his distance from Mr. Dole. Asked whether he mentioned his party's nominee when he campaigns, he replied, "Depends who I'm talking to."
In rural Sperryville, Bob Weinberg, a Democrat running for the House, proudly said he was campaigning on the slogan, "Re-elect Bill and take back the Hill."
Mr. Weinberg, who criticizes the Gingrich Congress at every opportunity, marveled at Mr. Clinton's popularity in Virginia. "You can feel it at all the county fairs," he said. "The Clinton bumper stickers go like hotcakes. People at the county fairs tell me they've never seen Democrats get such a friendly reception, and I'm sure it wasn't my smile. It was the economy."
Republicans acknowledge the problem. Representative Cass Ballenger, who is considered a safe bet for re-election in his western North Carolina district, said his goal -- and that of his 234 Republican colleagues in the House -- will be to help drag Mr. Dole to victory. "The coattails issue is going to be reversed," he said. "We've got 235 Congressmen. If we can go home and campaign hard, we might put Bob Dole in with us."
Still, some Republicans worry that Mr. Dole's weakness in the polls might discourage voters from turning out, and thus deprive down-ballot candidates of support. "If they get so turned off they don't come out at all," said Virginia Blankenbaker, a Republican who is seeking a House seat in Indianapolis, "it could hurt." She said it "would be counterproductive" to have Mr. Dole campaign on her behalf -- even though Indiana has long been viewed as a Republican state -- adding that "I need to stay with my race and keep it isolated" from the national ticket.
As much as many Republicans are keeping their distance from Messrs. Dole and Gingrich while Mr. Clinton is enjoying a burst of popularity, remnants of 1994 attitudes remain.
In North Carolina, for instance, few Democrats go out of their way to mention the President. "Maybe they're softening a little bit," Gov. James B. Hunt Jr., a Democrat, said of critical attitudes toward Mr. Clinton in his state, "but the basic feelings are what they were."
And in Alexandria, Va., Representative James P. Moran Jr., a Democrat, avoids talking about Mr. Clinton on the trail. "He's running his own campaign, and that's fine; we're running ours," he said. "I got more votes than he did in '92."
While Mr. Moran's Republican rival, John Otey, is not to the point of boasting about Mr. Dole in his advertisements, he still runs proudly with his party's nominee. "We're both from Kansas, and we're both veterans," Mr. Otey said. "I'm just honored to be on that ticket."
Donald H. Rumsfeld, national chairman of the Dole campaign, contends that it is perfectly natural for Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton to play down Congress: "They're both running for President of the United States. That is an executive job, not a legislative job."

HEADLINE: Durable Orders Drop 3.1%, but What Does It All Mean?

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Two days after the Federal Reserve decided that the economy was cooling down enough that no interest-rate increase was necessary, fresh figures today showed that the Fed was right, some economists said.
Then again, other analysts said the latest numbers may be saying almost nothing about the economy's pace or the prospects for inflation. 
 The Commerce Department's report that orders for durable goods fell a surprisingly high 3.1 percent in August "indicates clearly that economic growth is slowing significantly this quarter and will remain slow over the next few quarters," Elliott Platt and John Bailey, economists at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, told clients.
Although this optimistic view seemed to win at least mild endorsement from the bond market, where interest rates eased somewhat, many analysts disagreed or remained neutral.
"Not at all," asserted John R. Williams, a senior analyst at the Bankers Trust Company, when asked whether the drop in orders, the biggest since April, showed that the Fed was wise to sit tight. "The durable goods number is extremely volatile," he added, suggesting that last month's decline be regarded as a routine statistical reverse from July's 1.4 percent advance.
At the same time, analysts largely agreed on disregarding a rise in first-time claims for unemployment benefits, to 340,000 from 329,000, for the week ended Sept. 21. While this increase also seemed to support the Fed's stance, the figures were undoubtedly skewed by Hurricane Fran. They have also shown a pronounced tendency in recent years to rise at this time of year in spite of the Labor Department's efforts to adjust them for recurring seasonal factors.
Another tidbit published today, the Conference Board's monthly tally of help-wanted advertising, also showed no trend. The index edged down one point in August, to 82, remaining in the 80-90 range where it has hovered for two years.
The report on durable goods, which is closely monitored despite wide swings and the fact that it covers less than 20 percent of the economy, this time inspired markedly different reactions even within the same institution.
At the First Union Corporation, Joel L. Naroff, chief bank economist, said from his Philadelphia office that the durables report "provides some support" for the view that the economy will slow enough to avoid monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve. But at the company headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., David Orr, the chief capital markets economist, called durables "such a flaky monthly number" that "probably not much" should be made of it.
Despite the broad nature of the decline, Robert G. Dederick, economic consultant to the Northern Trust Company, was similarly reluctant to use today's figures to judge the Fed. "I guess they show that the committee didn't necessarily do the wrong thing," he said with a note of skepticism. He said his own adjustments to the figures to filter out the most erratic items showed August's orders to be little changed from June levels.
But another Chicago economist, John E. Silvia of Zurich Kemper Investments, enthusiastically supported Tuesday's decision. "The Fed did a fine job, a wise thing," he declared, pointing to what he said was unassailable evidence that since spring orders for durables "are either flat or have clearly slowed down."
Declines last month included 7.9 percent for transportation equipment, the third consecutive drop; 5.6 percent for electrical machinery, the first decline since May; 2.7 percent for primary metals, and seven-tenths of 1 percent for industrial machinery other than electrical machinery.
Excluding military items, which rebounded 9 percent after a July drop of 40.9 percent, durables orders fell 3.5 percent, the report showed.
Orders for capital goods, excluding both military hardware and civilian aircraft, were down 5 percent in August after advancing 3.9 percent in July and 2.6 percent in June.
Shipments of durable goods, the Commerce Department report also said, rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month while unfilled orders declined by that amount.
"Let's see what the September report brings," suggested Ed Yardeni and Debbie Johnson, economists at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/ C. J. Lawrence.

HEADLINE: Egg Man Hangs On Amid Glitter;
TriBeCa Dairy Wholesaler Is Link With Pushcart Past

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Well before a city planner in the 1970's christened the area TriBeCa -- Triangle Below Canal -- the blocks just north of Chambers Street and east of Greenwich Street were the eggs, butter and cheese section of New York. Serious businessmen, usually chomping on immense cigars, stalked about in fedoras making deals involving thousands of dozens of eggs. The hundreds of belching delivery trucks and squirming pushcarts meant it often took more than an hour to drive one block.
The New York Mercantile Exchange, now in the World Trade Center, may be best known for helping set world oil prices, but it was the Butter, Cheese and Egg Exchange of New York until 1882, and was on Harrison Street, in the wholesale produce area known until recently as Washington Market. 
 The continuing swagger of the egg district was apparent in the 1930's, when Mae West purred that she was dating "a big butter-and-egg man from the city." The old-timers still remember the grand figure cut by J. D. Salinger's father, Sol, as he prowled the pandemonium with his cane and spats, and they laugh about the hard-boiled butter-and-egg tycoon who habitually pocketed dime tips left on neighborhood lunch counters.
"The whole world was here, and now it's all gone except for Steve," said Oliver Allen, a writer who moved to a TriBeCa loft in 1982. He meant Steven Wils, the last butter-and-egg man in TriBeCa. Mr. Wils owns the family wholesaling business, Harry Wils & Company, at 182 Duane Street.
And though Mr. Wils, who is 47, has 16 trucks chugging in and out of Duane Street, it is a vast mistake to say he does things in the way of his grandfather and father. They went door-to-door peddling the eggs they had personally gathered from upstate farmers in a Model T, sometimes sleeping in barns overnight. Then they began getting eggs in barrels, packed between layers of oats from the Midwest, and ultimately in boxcar loads barged across the Hudson from Jersey City.
Even that is quaint by today's standards. Today's egg farms are immense, with five million birds laying onto conveyor belts in one Ohio henhouse. First the grocery chains monopolized the business, and now the giant farms are eliminating even those middlemen. But Mr. Wils hangs on in the old family digs, admittedly augmented by expanding real estate holdings, now totaling five industrial buildings in a property market so fashionable it is called Hollywood East.
And he sells more eggs than his family predecessors would have imagined, more than 8,000 dozen a week, not to mention three boxcars full of butter. He survives as a middleman in a dying business by reversing the strategy of his father, whose trick was to corner supplies. Instead, he doggedly pursues the city's most expensive restaurants with products like truffles and extra-virgin olive oil to send along with the dairy staples. "Once we were supply driven, and now we're customer driven," he explained.
The old egg men began to recede after their produce counterparts on the other side of Greenwich Street were moved to Hunts Point in the Bronx in 1967. Their extinction was sealed by the rise of huge distribution networks and other major changes in how their business was conducted. Finally, the soaring price of lofts for residential use eased the wholesalers' way to New Jersey or Florida.
But on a deeper level, it is possible to suggest that they simply and inexorably grew irrelevant in a post-industrial city suddenly desperate for clean fingernails.
"There was a kind of congestion and liveliness that's very European," remembered Gerd Stern, who moved his family's butter, cheese and egg company, the Otto Stern Company, to Cresskill, N.J., a decade ago. "As countries grow more civilized, they tend to hide that kind of activity. And you lose something. You lose a lovely little piece of the world."
Mr. Wils clings to the memories, as evidenced by the old photographs and century-old price sheets he loves to collect. He tells how his grandfather Samuel founded the company in 1921 after escaping Eastern European pogroms. Eggs were an immigrant business with small start-up costs: you could pick up 30 dozen for $10 and sometimes almost double your money.
Steven Wils began helping in the business at age 15, but was not taken with the long hours that forced his father to leave the family's home in East New York, Brooklyn, from 5 A.M. to 7 P.M. But while Steven was a sophomore at the State University at New Paltz, his father fell ill and he returned home to work for five months.
He liked it, but not well enough to abandon his other dreams. He returned to college, where he switched his major from psychology to art and finally to philosophy. Upon graduation, he headed for San Francisco and became a water bed salesman.
But he began to long for New York, where people appreciated his cutting sense of humor. "You'd be sarcastic and no one would get it," he said of Californians.
After a six-month stay in Israel, where he toyed with the idea of dropping out and moving to India, he decided to return to work with his father, Harry, an irrepressible raconteur. The step was regarded suspiciously by the district's old-timers.
"People didn't want their sons to go into the business," he said. "It was dirty. It was long hours. You were dealing with a food commodity."
The young Mr. Wils made one demand. He wanted his father to buy a building on Duane Street for the business and for his own home -- this in 1974, when almost nobody lived south of Canal. Though he kept it to himself, part of his motivation was to be near "a great bar" down the street, the Barnabus Rex, which is defunct.
"My father thought I was absolutely crazy," Steven Wils said. "Dad said, 'Why should I buy a building when I can rent for almost nothing?' "
But he bought the building when buildings there were going for $20,000. Now, single floors in such edifices can command $1 million. He went on to buy two more buildings and sign long-term leases for two others.
Mr. Wils's adventure in downtown living began with the installation of a toilet in his 2,500-square-foot loft. He enjoyed the artists' moving in around him, one of whom designed his olive oil can. In 1983, he married Madelyn Goldberg, a television producer, and they now have three sons living in the original loft, which has since been joined to another.
"When I met him, he was just a butter, egg and cheese man," Ms. Wils said with a laugh. "Now, he's become special ingredients."
The special ingredients approach often means searching out novel products for restaurateurs, like dried strawberries or exotic mushrooms. It means holding an annual event in his warehouse -- miraculously transformed with glittering chandeliers to bring together chefs and suppliers from as far afield as France. Two local pastry chefs won $1,000 prizes for their sugary creations.
"Steve helps to start food trends," said Eberhard Muller, executive chef of Lutece.
David Bouley, the chef, said, "He has helped us develop different qualities of milk and butter." Mr. Bouley, who made the TriBeCa restaurant named after him one of the city's best and is now moving around the corner to 36 Hudson Street, added, "He is bringing his business to a higher level."
But Mr. Wils's most fundamental strategy is ample doses of the sort of old-fashioned hustle his father taught him as a boy -- scurrying up to the Tavern on the Green at a moment's notice with a case of butter is de rigueur. Such mobility is clearly the biggest advantage of his Manhattan location: almost all his prime customers are 15 minutes or less away. He will sometimes personally make deliveries by subway.
But despite such epicurean eagerness, the last man's days in the old neighborhood may be numbered. He says he needs more and better-arranged space than even five old buildings can provide and has been scouting sites in the Bronx and New Jersey.
He said he had made four calls to the city's Economic Development Corporation asking for help finding bigger digs, and perhaps subsidies, without a reply.
Russell A. Harding, a spokesman for the development agency, said yesterday that it had no record of Mr. Wils's calls but that it had a number of programs that might help him. "We look forward to discussing his options with him," Mr. Harding said.
City Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, who is fighting to help keep her constituent and his 60 jobs in the city, if not in the neighborhood, said, "He's kind of like the dinosaur that's still hanging in there."
And, hey, he cooks a terrific egg -- sunny side up, of course.

HEADLINE: Discontented Workfare Laborers Murmur 'Union'

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
Angry about their working conditions, some welfare recipients required to work for their benefits say that with the work should come the many protections available to other workers. While not objecting to work itself, these laborers complain that they are occupying a new basement tier in the labor force, one that lacks regulations on hours, wages and safety that other workers take for granted.
There are 30,000 workfare laborers in New York City, and officials say the new Federal welfare law could push the total to more than 100,000. With numbers like that, even murmurs of complaint ring loud to the city's municipal union leaders. 
 Those leaders, worried about the future of jobs for their own members, have questioned the program and begun to speak out about the recipients and the basic rights of workers. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, eager not to jeopardize the program he has called a great achievement of his administration, has agreed to meet today with Stanley Hill, the head of the largest union of city employees, to broker a resolution.
"At the start, the unions willingly stereotyped us as a bunch of transients, and only now have they opened their eyes to what is taking place," said John Gantt, who will report for his latest workfare assignment next month. "Some of us can't believe they have come around. Others believe it's about damn time."
He is among a small band of workers who are not waiting for help from the unions and are trying to organize on their own. They are distributing leaflets and badges, preaching solidarity and planning ways to make the city take notice.
This nascent effort at unionizing is merely one more reflection of the considerable discontent that prevails among the thousands of men and women who have swept streets, transported corpses at city hospitals or performed other chores in the city's Work Experience Program, or WEP. Participants work at least 26 hours each week in return for benefits that can be as spare as $68.50 in cash and $60 in food stamps every two weeks.
Any organizing efforts face steep legal barriers. Under Federal law, welfare beneficiaries in workfare programs are not entitled to bargain as a group with an employer. They do not come under the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, which administers union elections.
But their complaints echo grievances that have served for decades as rallying cries for unions: low wages, conditions that include no gloves for street cleaners, no safety training and scant chance for advancement into permanent jobs. They say that as the city grows increasingly reliant on their labor, their sheer numbers will give them some leverage.
"We have to come together or else we'll sound like a bunch of complainers," said Barbara Stewart, a welfare recipient who said she worked for her benefits as a clerk at a welfare office in downtown Brooklyn. "There are more than 30,000 of us. There has to be some power in that."
Exactly how much power remains a big question. Leaders of the group organizing the workfare recipients, WEP Workers Together, say they have a couple hundred members. Willie James, the head of the Transport Workers Union in the city, agreed last week to allow thousands of workfare participants to clean subways and buses alongside union workers, but also raised the possibility that his union could later capture their numbers if they got real jobs.
Mr. Hill said that at his meeting with the Mayor, he was willing to "go to bat" for the welfare recipients. He said that the workfare program in the city was not being run properly, that the guidelines about union jobs not being filled by welfare workers had been violated in some cases, and that the program was not leading to meaningful numbers of people entering the real workplace.
"I'd love to organize as many of them as we could, but we don't have the legal leverage," Mr. Hill said of the recipients. "The program needs to be fixed. It needs to be about jobs, real jobs. The fear about worker and job displacement is real, and it's a national fear."
Other union leaders, perceiving the recipients as either a threat or potential allies, have begun to speak out about the conditions. Victor Gotbaum, Mr. Hill's predecessor as executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the umbrella union of nonuniformed city workers, said the unions had reason to be nervous.
"We tried to unionize the welfare recipients a decade ago," Mr. Gotbaum said. "They were ruled not to be workers. We wanted to give them protection, and I don't think we even spoke of dues. They are an exploited, underpaid group. But our problem wasn't a large one then. Candidly, it now appears overwhelming."
Workfare participants have no unified or singular voice. The city says that a large portion of the 100,000 people who have moved through the program have jobs, but officials have not conducted long-term studies. There are many who are grateful for the chance to be doing anything other than nothing.
But interviews with dozens of workfare participants in recent weeks and days make clear that the dominant sentiments on the city's strange labor landscape are anger, frustration, and, particularly with the recent awakening of the city's unions, a kind of cynical amusement.
Many believe workfare is a thinly veiled effort to create a vast pool of cheap labor; others describe the program as vindictive, inflexible and aimed chiefly at removing people from the welfare rolls; others offer accounts of more modest slights and disillusionments, from the thoughtless placement of people in jobs for which they are not best suited to the sign above a restroom in a Sanitation Department building that reads: No W.E.P. Workers Allowed.
Some recipients working at Bellevue Hospital, transporting patients or changing beds, say there are so many workfare workers now at the hospital that they are "falling over each other," with virtually none obtaining full-time jobs. "Why should they actually hire anyone?" asked Pat Simmons, a 49-year-old woman who said she had worked 26 hours a week at Bellevue for nearly two years without gaining a real job. "We all but work for free."
Luis Fernandez, a former automobile mechanic who has spent recent months cleaning streets in Brooklyn, said there were no uniforms for him to wear, often no boots or gloves. Mostly, he said, he is given orders. "We are the garbage," he said.
While city officials have insisted that welfare workers have not taken up jobs currently or formerly performed by union workers, participants in the program said that distinction has become severely blurred. There are recipients working in clerical jobs in welfare offices, and in any number of other agencies. One even worked as an aide to a senior official at the Human Resources Administration, the city agency that carries out the workfare program.
"Those union workers should be worried about their jobs," said Kevin Anderson, a 22-year-old welfare recipient picking up trash in Marcus Garvey Park in Harlem one morning this week. "Shoot, we have been doing their jobs for months. I don't even see the city workers around here much. Except when they come to watch us do their jobs."
The recent display of both interest and alarm by the city's labor unions has provoked ambivalence among the workfare participants. "They have a right to be mad," Miguel Hernandez, a welfare worker sweeping up in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, said of the city's unionized workers. "Taking a broom, then taking your job -- we're not comfortable with that." But Daisy Padua, a 50-year-old welfare worker in the Bronx, said of the city program, "I don't mind if the union loses members as long as they come through with a job."
The effort to organize welfare workers was the brainchild of public assistance recipients who had brought their experiences and gripes to three separate nonprofit welfare advocacy organizations -- Community Voices Heard, the Fifth Avenue Committee in Brooklyn and the Urban Justice Center in Manhattan.
The organizations, along with representatives from several unions in the city, have provided staff and technical support, and have pledged to provide legal representation in the event of a job action. They said they were not aware of any similar attempt around the country.
The organizers have met with leaders of District Council 37, Mr. Hill's union. Roughly 40 welfare workers marched in the Labor Day parade earlier this month alongside members of Communication Workers of America Local 1180, which represents city computer technicians and clerical supervisors. A work slowdown -- recipients will show up for work, but do the bare minimum -- is under consideration for later this fall.
Wendell Ortiz, a former Parks Department employee who is one of the organizing effort's founders, said he quit his city job in protest over the program he had to help administer. "In the Parks Department adults were taking orders from teen-agers who were there working as seasonal employees," he said. "No one got jobs. People were working without any concerns about safety. There was no overtime, no vacation."
Colleen M. Roche, a spokeswoman for the Mayor, said City Hall had no comment on the organizing effort or on the specific complaints made by the recipients. Several organizers have charged that city workers and security guards at workfare sites have threatened welfare workers who were handing out flyers or recruiting members.
If nothing else, the recent maneuverings by the Mayor and the unions have brought the thousands of workfare participants front and center in the debate about welfare reform and city economics.
"The WEP workers don't want the city unions to fight the workfare program so that it is killed, because these people want to work," said Ed Ott, a political director of C.W.A. Local 1180. "But they want it to be fair. They want it to be a real job creation program. They believe their fundamental relationship with the government has changed. They are workers now. They want the full protections any worker is entitled to."

HEADLINE: All-Stars in a Garden Encore

 BODY:
Four years ago, Dave Checketts had a brainstorm. With the popularity of the National Basketball Association growing rapidly, Checketts, then the Knicks' president, thought it was time for the All-Star Game to return to Madison Square Garden.
Yesterday, New York was officially awarded the league's 48th annual showcase event, to be held Feb. 6-8, 1998. The weekend is projected to generate $25 million for the city's economy and will mark yet another coup for the Garden proprietorship, which will bring the Grammy Awards to the building next year. 
 "I think it secures your place as the No. 1 address for entertainment and sports in the world," Checketts, now the Garden's president, said yesterday on the steps of City Hall.
The old Garden, situated at 49th Street and Eighth Avenue, was host to the 1954, 1955 and 1968 games. The 1968 contest was played on Jan. 23, less than a month before the current arena opened.
Checketts took part in yesterday's announcement along with N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Knicks team president Ernie Grunfeld and the broadcaster Marv Albert. The Garden beat out bids from Portland and Philadelphia.

HEADLINE: A New For-Profit School Sets Off a Turf Battle in Detroit

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Like a company invading another market, a cash-strapped Michigan public school district opened a for-profit school in midtown Detroit today with the explicit purpose of making money, infuriating Detroit school officials who called it "educational piracy."
The economics are simple: The school district of Romulus, Mich., plans to collect $5,300 a year in state education aid for each student taught in Detroit. Romulus has hired a small, private company to run the school for $4,240 a student and will pocket the difference. 
 The private operator will pay students who dropped out of Detroit high schools as much as $900 a year in transportation and lunch money to attend. But this morning, some of the more than 100 youths who showed up for the first day of school, said that money was not their motive for attending.
The company running the school, Baron Schools Inc., is partly owned by a local entrepreneur, Peter Bakama, who has been operating an adult education vocational school in a northern suburb of Detroit for at least two years. Dr. William M. Bedell, the Romulus superintendent, said he thought that Mr. Bakama had been working from a home office and could be reached only by beeper.
Dr. Bedell said he viewed the new school as a good way to raise money for his 4,100-student district. "I'm not a social worker," he said on Wednesday. "We were looking for ways to help our kids and it looked like it was within the law and would not hurt Detroit." He said the school would be geared to dropouts, for whom the city does not receive state education aid anyway.
Detroit school officials are nonetheless furious.
"We see this as an act of educational piracy," said Dr. Arthur M. Carter, a deputy superintendent. "We see this as a school district treating students as cash cows without any interest in their educational development."
The Detroit school system's lawyers have asked Romulus schools for information about student attendance, teacher training and other issues at the new school, and may seek a court ruling to close it or block state aid, Dr. Carter added.
This morning, youths mostly in their late teens gathered outside a small, two-story building with peeling white paint this morning, waiting for classes to begin. Several students said that they had heard they would be paid $50 every two weeks to attend. The students were recruited partly through word of mouth and partly through door-to-door visits by Baron Schools staff over the last two months. Dr. Bedell said that while the details were still being worked out, fortnightly payments of $50 were likely. But not one of the students cited the money as a reason for attending.
"I want to make something of myself," said Chaka Respess, a 19-year-old from southeastern Detroit who dropped out of 10th grade four years ago because she found school too boring. Miss Respess said that she planned now to study cosmetology.
"I already know how to do hair, so pretty soon I'll have a salon," she said.
Reese Smith, a 17-year-old from southeastern Detroit, said that she had completed 10th grade last spring at a Detroit public high school. But her mother decided over the summer to enroll her in the Romulus school here because it was smaller.
"She thought there'd be less peer pressure" to engage in "everything -- sex, drugs, everything," said Miss Smith, who also planned to study cosmetology.
Robert Howard, a 19-year-old from west Detroit, said he left school five years ago, in ninth grade, when he was jailed for what he described as "hurting people." Mr. Howard said that he would attend the car mechanics course here because he now believed that, "Education is the key to everything."
Romulus officials say the arrangement in Detroit was made possible by a new state law designed to give parents more choice in where they send their children to school. Signed in June by Gov. John Engler, a Republican, the law sets state aid to each municipal school district based on the number of enrolled students from anywhere in its county.
Detroit and Romulus, 11 miles to the southwest, are both in Wayne County, Mich. Previously, state aid was given according to the number of enrolled public-school students who are residents of the municipality.
The Romulus outpost opened on the eve of a crucial date in determining state aid. The attendance number on on Friday will determine how much Romulus will receive, subject to revision after a second head count in February.
Dr. Bedell opposed the new state education aid law before its passage, worrying that some students in Romulus, a fairly low-income township, would seek to attend better-financed schools in adjacent communities in Wayne County.
The aid is typically paid in 10 installments beginning in December. Dr. Bedell said that the Romulus schools will cover all of the Detroit school's expenses until then and then reimburse itself from the money that Baron Schools will receive.
Romulus is also lending some textbooks and curriculums to the new school, and the school's teachers are on the Romulus payroll, Dr. Bedell said. But Mr. Bakama is hiring the teachers, who are not unionized, and setting their pay rates.
Dr. Bedell's assistant tried to reach Mr. Bakama through his beeper so that he could be interviewed, but Mr. Bakama did not call back.
Teressa Staten, the chief deputy superintendent of the Michigan Department of Education, said that the state would check the quality of the education provided in the new school, known as the Romulus-Baron School of Choice, but would not do so immediately.
"The onus is on the local board of education" in Romulus, she said. "We hope that their purpose is to give these kids an education which leads to a high school diploma."
Romulus and Mr. Bakama had planned to open the school in a downtown Detroit building just a dozen blocks west of the City Hall, but ended up using another building in midtown Detroit today when fire marshals declared on Wednesday that the downtown building was unfit for immediate use as a school.
Dr. Bedell said the curriculum at the new school would include English, math and science, as required by state law, but taught as part of vocational education, an effort to give students a practical reason to stay in school, he said.
Education experts agreed the experiment appears to be the first of its kind, but they had mixed views about it. Chester E. Finn Jr., a senior fellow in the Washington offices of the conservative Hudson Institute, said the experiment could prove a very good idea if it delivered a high-quality education. "I'm all in favor of entrepreneurial school districts colonizing other school districts if they can deliver the goods educationally," he said.
But Heidi Steffens, a policy analyst on for-profit schools at the National Education Association, a 2.2-million-member union and professional organization for public school employees, said she was was appalled. "I have never before heard of a public school fronting for a private entrepreneur in order to raise money for its own schools," she said.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: ON THE AIR;
PBS Breaks Further Ground With Debate of Congressional Leaders

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
The Public Broadcasting Service believes it has glimpsed the future of political journalism, and it is, of course, earnest.
In a year of extraordinary experimentation in political coverage, the TV-and-crumpets crowd at PBS has led the broadcast television field. While commercial networks have gnashed their teeth over how much free time they should dribble out to Presidential candidates, PBS is merrily ladling it out to politicians -- and to the electorate. 
 On Sunday night, public broadcasting will present its latest experiment, a nationally televised hourlong debate among the Congressional leadership. Before and after that debate, 73 PBS stations around the country will broadcast debates or other forums involving local House and Senate candidates.
The debate comes as polls suggest that Republican control of Congress is shaky. "This year you could argue the election of the Congress is as important as the election of the White House, in setting the future direction of the country," said Ellen Hume, executive director of PBS's Democracy Project, which helped organize the debates.
Ms. Hume said that ever since the nasty 1988 Presidential election campaign, academics, journalists and politicians had been wondering "why this is such a negative experience for everybody -- the candidates, the journalists and the citizens."
In search of a remedy, she said, the Democracy Project "is supposed to be a lab for trying new kinds of news and public affairs programming that works hard to engage citizens." It is experimenting with programming like debates, free time for candidates, and specials about issues and citizens' lives and concerns.
It may sound as American as apple pie, but, for precisely that reason, this approach, like other forms of so-called "public journalism," has its skeptics.
"The myth of America is being dusted off again," said Bill Kovach, the curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard. "And a lot of it's good; I don't want to denigrate it. But an awful lot of it's pseudo-journalism. If there's kind of a celebratory tinge to your journalism, it's easy to overlook things that don't fit into your mold."
For example, he said, following the public's lead in determining what is important may cause journalists to play down issues that have not yet had an obvious effect, like recent changes in welfare.
The national Congressional debate on Sunday night is to take place in the House of Burgesses in Colonial Williamsburg. Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, will square off against their Democratic counterparts -- Representative Richard A. Gephardt and Senator Tom Daschle, the minority leaders.
Jim Lehrer, of "The Newshour With Jim Lehrer," will moderate -- but only moderately. After two opening questions from him, the four politicians will debate resolutions on the economy, foreign policy and other matters, said Dan Werner, the president of MacNeil/Lehrer Productions and executive producer of the debate.
Mr. Werner said Congressional races now had a "national tinge," because the Republicans waged a national campaign in 1994 to gain control of both houses. But, through its member stations, PBS is also giving viewers a chance to see their local candidates debate. At present, candidates in 71 House races and 18 Senate races are scheduled to participate, although the roster keeps shifting as candidates get cold feet.
PBS officials and Congressional historians said they believed that a similar national debate among Congressional leaders took place in 1972, also on public television, but they could not find a record of it today.
Several commercial cable and broadcast networks have also been experimenting this year to try to allay viewers' cynicism and apathy about politics. On the TCI cable network, the program "Race for the Presidency" has been providing free time since last fall for candidates to state their views. Last week the Fox television network inaugurated a similar feature, giving each Presidential candidate at least one minute a week. And in a series called "Democracy in America '96," CNN has been stepping back from covering the political horse race to examine, in hourlong prime-time specials, what it calls "the deep-rooted fears of ordinary Americans."
Some students of television believe that the networks are starting to respond to criticism of political coverage.
"Television coverage of news generally, and probably politics particularly, has taken quite a beating for being pretty thin stuff, and pretty sensationalized," said Roderick P. Hart, a professor of communications and government at the University of Texas.
But even now, the organizations that are acting most decisively to address that charge, he noted, are "PBS and CNN, not the high-dollar operations."
The jury remains out on whether viewers are responding to this experimentation. For example, PBS has been broadcasting a series called "Citizens '96," examining issues like "family values" through the lives of actual American families. But the ratings have not been great, Ms. Hume said. "We've had zero promotion budget," she said, "so we cannot say we have had a huge audience for any of these."
But, she added, viewers who have discovered such PBS programs are happy with them: "We get E-mail from people saying, 'Thank goodness someone is finally listening to us.' "

HEADLINE: U.S. CENSUS FINDS FIRST INCOME RISE IN PAST SIX YEARS

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Household income rose in 1995 for the first time in six years, the Census Bureau reported today, as the number of poor people in the United States dropped by more than 1.6 million, reaching historic lows for blacks and the elderly.
The bureau said half the households in the country had incomes of at least $34,074, an increase of 2.7 percent over the previous year. The inflation-adjusted increase of $898 was the first rise in median household income since 1989, the year before the nation's last recession, and it was the largest increase in household earnings since 1986. 
 At the same time, the percentage of the nation's population that is poor dropped to 13.8, from 14.5 in 1994. It was the second consecutive year of a decline in the poverty rate.
The report said that 29.3 percent of blacks in the United States lived below the poverty line in 1995. For the first time since 1959, when the Census Bureau started keeping such statistics -- and probably for the first time in the nation's history -- the poverty rate for African-Americans dipped below 30 percent.
Also for the first time, the poverty rate for the nation's elderly last year dropped below that of working-age people, making those 65 years of age and older the group with the lowest percentage of poor people.
The Clinton Administration seized on the relatively rosy news contained in the report to praise its economic record. "Today it is clear that more and more of our people are sharing in that prosperity," President Clinton said. "We are growing -- and growing together."
Much of the rise in household incomes was in the Midwest, a crucial region in the Presidential campaign.
But Bob Dole, Mr. Clinton's Republican challenger, seized on some less encouraging news in the report: its finding that while household income has increased, earnings for both male and female full-time workers declined. This indicated that more people are working in a household or that wage earners are working at more than one job.
Mr. Dole said the bureau figures did not reflect the economic anxiety of Americans. He maintained that the rise in household incomes stemmed primarily from more people working per household, rather than an increase in individual wages for full-time workers.
John D. Mueller, an economist and former aide to Jack Kemp, the Republican Vice-Presidential nominee, said: "President Clinton obviously is going to make the most he can with these figures in comparison with other administrations. But if you compare the number of people who have gotten employment and the number of jobs created, there are four new jobs for every three additional workers employed."
And Nelson Warfield, the Dole campaign spokesman, said, "These cold economic statistics may please Bill Clinton, but they do nothing to comfort a homemaker trying to buy groceries or a wage earner worried about the next paycheck."
The improvements in household income and poverty rates were concentrated in the Midwest, a region that underwent a wrenching economic downturn in the early 1980's as such industries as steel and automobile manufacturing were downsized.
Median household income increased by 7.2 percent in the Midwest, but it rose only slightly in the Northeast, the South and the West.
In Connecticut, median household income fell to $40,243 last year, from $42,262 in 1994. But household income rose in New York, to $33,028 in 1995 from $32,803 in 1994, and in New Jersey, to $43,924 last year from $43,478 in 1994.
"The industrial Midwest has been particularly helpful in bringing up household incomes," said Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich. "Unemployment there has been so low that even in the low-wage service sector many people are getting jobs they otherwise would not."
In a reversal of what has been a long-term trend toward greater income inequality, the Census Bureau report said the poor, the working class and the middle class increased their share of the nation's aggregate income, while the percent of total household income earned by the top 20 percent declined slightly, to 48.7 percent from 49.1 percent.
Overall, the three separate reports issued today by the Census Bureau -- one on incomes, another on poverty and a third on health insurance coverage -- painted a rosy picture of the nation's economic well-being.
Incomes increased across the board, and rose sharply for some groups, including households headed by blacks and women, where they have historically lagged.
But the report also noted a steep decline of 5.1 percent in income for Hispanic households. The drop in Hispanic earnings contrasted sharply with the 2.2 percent rise in incomes for non-Hispanic whites and the 3.6 percent increase in earnings for African-American households.
Indeed, the Census Bureau noted that 1995 marked the first time the Hispanic poverty rate was greater than that for blacks.
And with continuing immigration and the loss of benefits to legal immigrants who are not yet citizens, some economists expect the Hispanic poverty rate to worsen.
"We just enacted a welfare bill that has very deep cuts in all basic forms of assistance to legal immigrants, not an insignificant number of whom are Hispanics," said Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group. "I would think that in the years ahead we will reach all-time highs in Hispanic poverty."
Perhaps the most eye-catching aspects of the reports, however, are the economic journeys they trace for blacks and the elderly.
In 1959, according to the Census Bureau, 35.2 percent of the elderly were poor, the highest percentage of any age group in the country, and about double the rate of working-age people, 18 to 64.
Primarily as the result of Social Security and increases in private pensions, the poverty rate among the elderly was 10.5 percent last year, for the first time dropping below that of working-age people.
While the gains were not as dramatic as those for the elderly, blacks have also shown a steady decrease in their poverty rate, to 29.3 percent last year from 55.1 percent in 1959.

THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

 BODY:

A Bridge Too Far
Granted, Bob Dole started it. At the Republican convention, he asked voters to let him be "a bridge to a time of tranquillity, faith and confidence in action." But then the White House joined in. And now this bridge business is becoming the "Where's the beef?" of the 1996 Presidential season: catchy, easy to understand and overworked. 
 President Clinton has seized on the bridge metaphor like a snapping turtle on a broomstick. His bridges always run "to the 21st century." They are "big enough, strong enough, wide enough for everybody to walk across," and "everyone has a right to walk on the bridge." They focus a lot, on "making sure that each and every American has the right to make the best of his or her life." They have a foundation, "the world's finest education system."
They go just about everywhere: to classrooms hooked up to the Internet, to college for everyone, to stronger families, to "strong economy, good schools, safe streets, a clean environment, healthy children, successful families and communities." And so on.
By the count of the Nexis database, which collects most Presidential remarks, Mr. Clinton has wielded the word "bridge" 243 times in speeches this month. That is an average of 9.346 bridges per appearance.
The President's opponents have responded in characteristic but muted fashion. "These are all toll bridges," Mr. Dole likes to say.
Ross Perot is, well, classic Perot. "We start with a noble cause, or an artist's sketch of a beautiful idea, like the bridge, and then we enact massive legislation without a blueprint or checking to see if there is rock beneath the soil for a solid foundation," he said in one of his television commercials. "There's no detailed planning, no cost estimates -- just laws and giant cost overruns."
Maybe politics will declare a moratorium on bridge metaphors. If anyone seriously expects that to occur, there's a bridge in Brooklyn that he ought to take a look at.
 
Cabinet-in-Waiting?
Everyone knows who Bill Clinton chose to run the Government as President. So why shouldn't they get a sneak peek at Bob Dole's Presidential organizational chart?
Maybe they will. Officials in Mr. Dole's campaign are considering having their candidate disclose before the election whom he would like to name to the Cabinet should he become President. That would not be unprecedented in national politics; as a candidate for the Republican nomination in 1976, Ronald Reagan announced his choice for Vice President, Senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania.
But never has a candidate formally revealed his Cabinet in advance. A Washington lawyer with two decades of Democratic campaign experience, Robert Barnett, said he had run across the concept before and doubted its merits. "It has a surface attraction -- 'Oh, boy; if you vote for X candidate, you also get Y Cabinet member,' " he said. "But most people aren't going to change their vote because of Y Cabinet member. It can look awfully presumptuous."
But the upside, at least in the eyes of Dole supporters, is fairly obvious: a Dole Cabinet-in-waiting would presumably demonstrate a moderate brand of conservatism, reassuring voters who fear the far right. It would raise the profile of a campaign that, so far, has not grabbed the electorate by its lapels.
It also would offer a comparison to Mr. Clinton's Cabinet, whose occupants have occasioned more than the usual allotment of ethical embarrassments and criminal inquiries in the last four years.
Scott Reed, Mr. Dole's campaign manager, declined to discuss the prospects for an early announcement of Cabinet picks. But he did suggest that the people Mr. Dole would attract would easily outshine what he called "the Clinton Cabinet Hall of Shame."
There is one other powerful incentive. Naming a Cabinet now would no doubt permit Mr. Dole to whisper, over and over, those three little words that America supposedly longs to hear: General Colin Powell, General Colin Powell, General Colin Powell. . . .
 
All Dressed Up, but . . .
Hundreds of journalists who cover Presidential politics soon will get a package in the mail stuffed with freebies: a tote bag, T-shirt, buttons, a lapel pin and a sheaf of handouts, all promoting St. Louis and its Washington University as the site of the campaign's first Presidential debate.
One small problem: St. Louis is not a debate site any more. The Clinton and Dole camps agreed to drop Washington University, the first of three proposed debate locales, during negotiations earlier this month. The last-minute cancellation leaves the city and the institution in the position of a suitor who has rented a tuxedo, waxed the Chevy and bought a spray of roses, only to find that his date is going to a rival school's prom.
St. Louis had put up a $500,000 donation from Anheuser-Busch Companies and $250,000 from a local business group to stage the debate and attendant affairs, including free food and entertainment for the traveling press. And Washington University was in mid-primp when the debate fell through, soundproofing its 4,000-seat arena, laying power cables and pumping up the air-conditioning to keep the debate atmosphere a constant 68 degrees.
Busch officials are discussing the fate of their $500,000 gift with officials of the Commission on Presidential Debates, but are assured of getting their money back if they want it.
And the university, which staged one of the 1992 debates on short notice, is taking matters in stride. "One thing we want everyone to understand is that this is politics," Fred Volkmann, the vice chancellor for public affairs, said this week. "What we're really out is a lot of time and a lot of volunteer work."
 
Sound Bite
"What we've had is sort of a marriage here between some on the far -- not on the far, but some of the supply side area and some of the deficit hawks." -- Bob Dole, describing the genesis of his economic package to supporters last week. MICHAEL WINES

Lag in Health Coverage

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
New Jerseyans were better off financially than most other Americans last year, but a comparatively high percentage were not protecting themselves from the potential costs of catastrophic illness, the Census Bureau reported yesterday.
The surveys showed that New Jersey's median income last year was $43,924, up slightly from 1994 and second only to Alaska's. New Jersey had a poverty rate of 7.8 percent last year, the nation's third-lowest after Alaska and New Hampshire. The state's poverty rate has fallen from 9.2 percent in 1994 and 10.9 percent in 1993. 
 The Census Bureau also reported that 14.2 percent of the state's residents were not covered by health insurance, up from 13 percent in 1994. Twenty-six states ranked higher than New Jersey in percentage of residents with health coverage. Related article, Page A1.

Copper Prices Continue Rally As Industry Uses Up Inventory

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Copper prices surged yesterday as the drop in London Metal Exchange copper stockpiles accelerated, showing consumption by manufacturers was climbing.
On other markets, corn and soybeans fell, while gasoline and oil prices rose. 
 Copper inventories fell by 10,252 tons, to 272,630 tons, between Tuesday and Thursday, the London Metal Exchange said in the second of its two weekly reports. Warehouses in Europe, Asia and the United States posted declines. It was the seventh consecutive drop in stockpiles and the biggest decline since June.
For the week, stockpiles fell 19,979 tons, or 7.3 percent, accelerating a decline that began earlier this month as a seasonal lull in manufacturing drew to a close.
"The summer doldrums, when we saw stockpiles rising, are over," said Nick Fabiano, a trader with Asarco Inc. in New York. "Business is good. Copper scrap and wire mills are very busy."
Copper for December delivery rose 0.8 cent, to 91.25 cents a pound, on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest since Sept. 4 and the fourth straight gain.
The stockpile drop comes amid signs of robust economic growth in the United States, which could increase demand for copper.
"We've seen good demand for copper in the U.S.," said Jim Wurtsmith, a vice president of Omnisource, a copper scrap recycling firm in Fort Wayne, Ind. "That's partly why we are seeing stockpiles decline."
Corn fell to a seven-month low, and soybeans also dropped, as forecasts for mild weather in the Midwest eased fear that frost would reduce the autumn harvest.
December corn fell 2.75 cents, to $2.0325 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest since Feb. 8. November soybeans slid 7.5 cents, to $7.8325 a bushel.
Gasoline rose, lifting oil prices amid expectations that American refiners might trim production because of low profit margins.
October gasoline rose 1.61 cents, to 64.60 cents a gallon, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The rally pulled other oil prices higher. November crude rose 44 cents, to $24.60 a barrel, and October heating oil rose 0.59 cent, to 71.49 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: Fed Officials Were Divided At Aug. 20 Rates Meeting

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Divided Federal Reserve officials, while keeping interest rate policy steady this summer, agreed that they needed to be vigilant against any resurgence of inflation, according to minutes released today.
Members of the Fed's policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, focused on data indicating the economy was slowing without the help of an interest rate increase and was not generating significant inflation pressures, minutes of the Aug. 20 meeting disclosed. 
 A majority concluded the "prudent course" was to await further developments that would permit them to assess the need for tighter credit with a "higher degree of confidence."
But, the minutes said, the members agreed "the committee should remain particularly vigilant to incoming information bearing on the outlook for inflation."
But some members expressed greater fears of imminent inflation threats, arguing "the evidence suggested that a prompt policy action was needed to contain inflation" and avoid difficult problems for policy makers later.
But in the end, only Gary Stern, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, voted to raise rates. It was his second consecutive lone dissent. The other 11 members voted to leave rates unchanged.
The panel met again this week and again voted against any rate change, despite continuing division over policy.
Although eight of the 12 Fed regional bank presidents, according to a report by the Reuters news service last week, requested an increase in the discount rate, Fed officials voted Tuesday to keep it unchanged at 5 percent. The discount rate is the rate the Fed charges commercial banks for loans.
Many analysts interpreted the lack of action on interest rates as a sign committee members believed the economy was continuing to slow on its own and not threatening renewed inflation.
It was the panel's last meeting until Nov. 13, eight days after the Presidential election.
Voting members include the 7 Fed governors in Washington and 5 of the 12 regional presidents. All of the presidents, who rotate in voting, participate in deliberations at the meetings, which are held eight times a year.

Kemp Leads G.O.P. Charge in California

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: FILLMORE, Calif., Sept. 27

 BODY:
Jack Kemp began a busy four-day campaign swing through California today, part of what aides sought to portray as an intensive effort to put President Clinton on the defensive in a critical electoral battleground.
Vigorously disputing reports that Bob Dole's advisers see no real chance of carrying California, Republican strategists said that the campaign had spent about $1.25 million on television advertising in the state in the last two weeks and that it would continue to invest considerable money and time here for the duration of the campaign. 
 "Rumor aside, we are going to spend a lot of time in California, a lot of money in California," said Mr. Kemp, the Republican Vice-Presidential nominee. "We think this is a critical state."
Later, speaking from the back of a train that he rode into town from a few miles away, Mr. Kemp stressed his longstanding support for rewriting the tax code, but he never specifically mentioned Mr. Dole's plan to cut tax rates by 15 percent. Mr. Kemp's aides had said the tax-cut message was to be the main theme of his appearances in California.
Democratic officials said the Republicans were exaggerating both their advertising spending in the state and their chances of making inroads against President Clinton, who has maintained a lead in the double digits in most polls in California.
Bill Carrick, a senior adviser to the Clinton campaign in California, said that the Dole-Kemp ticket had spent only about $300,000 a week on television time, about half what the Republicans report and that such spending would not be enough to make much of an impact in a state as large as California. Moreover, they said, Mr. Dole has not been able to narrow the consistent 15-point gap in the polls.
"We're glad they're spending money and candidate time here rather than somewhere that they have a chance to win," Mr. Carrick said. "There's an effort by local Republicans to say it's a competitive campaign so they can continue to get national resources to support their Congressional candidates."
But Republican strategists insisted that their commitment to winning the state was real. They said Mr. Kemp would not spend four straight days campaigning here if it was not.
Republican advisers said their own surveys showed that the gap had narrowed to around 10 points. Yet even as Dole campaign aides argued that the state was still winnable, they acknowledged that their strategy was aimed in part at forcing the Democrats to continue spending their time and money defending electoral turf that Mr. Clinton has worked hard to make impregnable.
"We're not going to abandon a state that's so significant to them, where we've been able to cut the lead so dramatically," said Wayne Berman, Mr. Kemp's political director and a senior Dole strategist. "If we can win California -- and we can -- Clinton will lose. There is no scenario he can construct to win the Presidency and get re-elected without winning this state."
Mr. Dole's campaign has sent conflicting signals for the last month about its intentions toward California. The state, with 54 votes, is the single biggest electoral prize and one that Mr. Clinton has unabashedly cultivated through regular visits and special attention to its problems.
Some political analysts said the Republican commitment to the state, to the extent that it is not an effort to keep the Democrats off balance, could fade if heavy campaigning and advertising did not show Mr. Dole narrowing the gap more significantly by mid-October.
Aides said that Mr. Kemp, who will travel throughout the state and do dozens of interviews with local newspapers and television and radio stations, will be followed here next week by Elizabeth Dole. Mr. Kemp, they said, will return next month, as will Mr. Dole, who made a quick swing through here last week.
Mr. Kemp's foray will include trips to poor areas of Los Angeles and Palo Alto, to the bedrock conservative area of Orange County and to the inland cities of Fresno and Bakersfield.
In a direct strike at one of Mr. Clinton's most important bases of support, Mr. Kemp will travel on Monday to Silicon Valley, where he will make an appearance at the software company Netscape and highlight the endorsement of the Republican ticket by a group of 100 chief executives of high-tech companies. Mr. Kemp is expected to use his Silicon Valley speech to exhort corporate America to play a more active role in addressing issues like poverty and education.
Mr. Kemp, 61, who was born in California and grew up there, campaigned today in Fillmore, the hometown of his wife, Joanne, who was celebrating her 60th birthday. Before a crowd of several thousand people, Mr. Kemp was repeatedly interrupted by a group of largely Hispanic hecklers protesting the Republican ticket's support for a California ballot initiative that would ban some types of affirmative action and for the immigration bill pending in Congress.
Mr. Kemp's spokeswoman, Alixe Glenn, said the protest was an "indecent, disrespectful, despicable display" engineered by the Clinton campaign to "disrupt Joanne Kemp's birthday party."
Several protesters said they were local high school students who had been organized by a Hispanic student organization. A few protesters carried Clinton-Gore signs.
Mr. Berman said California voters should be particularly receptive to the Republican pledges of lower taxes and less regulation because they were volatile and subject to considerable economic anxiety. He said they had suffered through a deeper recession than the rest of the country and had adapted to a shrinking military industry, a decline in the real estate industry and constant upheaval in the technology business.
Mr. Clinton's campaign here is focused on taking credit for a rebound in the state's economy in the past few years. But even though the economy in California has been bouncing back, unemployment here, at 7.1 percent, remains a full two percentage points higher than for the nation as a whole.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DEMOCRAT;
Clinton Sets His Sights as Wide as Texas

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Armed with shiny black cowboy boots, the obligatory Stetson and his best down-home drawl, President Clinton stormed through Texas today, campaigning for Democratic Congressional candidates and hoping to beat longhorn-size odds by carrying the state for his party for the first time since 1976.
"If the people are willing to give me a fair shot and look to the future, yes, I think we can carry Texas because it's right for the American people," Mr. Clinton said at a rally in Fort Worth, voicing a sentiment that might have got him laughed out of town two years ago. 
 Even now, virtually none of the President's senior aides share that assessment, despite recent polls showing Mr. Clinton running neck and neck here with Bob Dole, or slightly ahead. But the President, born in Arkansas, retains a sentimental attachment to his old neighboring state, dating to his salad days as the George McGovern campaign coordinator here in 1972. He insisted on scheduling a 18-hour day that took him from Longview in the east to Fort Worth in the north, then to Houston for an evening rally and fund raiser tonight.
"He just won't give it up," one senior aide said with weary affection as his boss prepared to address thousands of supporters in downtown Fort Worth under chilly clouds at midday. In fact, Mr. Clinton's 18-month tack to the center has left him doing better here than he could have expected in 1994, when many voters in the state were incensed at his unsuccessful effort to allow homosexuals to serve openly in the military and his successful one to ban 19 types of assault weapons.
Even the more pessimistic aides in the White House now hope that Mr. Clinton might help swing the balance in eight Congressional races in which Democrats are contending for open seats or running for re-election, which could help the party retake the House of Representatives.
Accordingly, the day was filled with Texas-sized talk and optimistic iconography, from Mr. Clinton's dropped g's and genial hyperbole to his visit on the tarmac at Ellington Field here with the astronaut Shannon W. Lucid, who returned to Earth on Thursday after setting a record -- 188 days -- for an American in space.
"It's a monument to the human spirit," Mr. Clinton said of Dr. Lucid's stay aboard the Russian space station Mir. "It's an amazing, amazing achievement."
For his part, Mr. Clinton basked in monumental images of his own. In Longview, the President spoke in front of a pair of miniature oil derricks and a red, white and blue banner proclaiming in Old West-style type that he was "Expanding the Frontier of the American Economy." The town's world-famous Kilgore Ranger Band from Kilgore College saluted him with the theme from "How the West Was Won," while the theme from "The Magnificent Seven" blared repeatedly from loudspeakers in Fort Worth.
When some Dole supporters appeared at the back of the crowd in Fort Worth and Mr. Clinton's partisans began jeering, the President broke in magnanimously: "No, no. Don't boo them. They're welcome here. This is America. Everybody's welcome here."
For nearly 150 years, since Texas was admitted to the union in 1845, no Democrat won the Presidency without carrying the state until Mr. Clinton did so in 1992. That year, without making any real effort in Texas, Mr. Clinton won 37 percent of the vote, compared with 41 percent for George Bush and 22 percent for Mr. Perot. No Democrat has carried the Dallas-Fort Worth area or greater Houston since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, and none has carried rural areas since Jimmy Carter in 1976.
The state's 32 electoral votes -- second-highest after California -- remain a valued prize, and Mr. Clinton insisted to the crowd in Fort Worth that if Texas Democrats talked to their neighbors in the 39 days remaining until the election, they would agree that "we might oughta vote for this President."
The White House political director, Douglas Sosnik, said Mr. Clinton's effort in Texas this year "is the first time in almost a generation that we're coming in here" and attempting to help local candidates and raise money to be used in campaigning in Texas. Since Mr. Carter's defeat in 1980, Mr. Sosnik said, Texas has "basically been an export state, been a cash cow for national Democrats."
Instead, Mr. Clinton expected to raise at least $1 million tonight for the Democratic National Committee at the home of Tillman Furtita, a restaurateur, with the bulk of it to be earmarked for use in the state.

HEADLINE: Reaping What the Boomers Sow;
Getting Down and Dirty in the Garden Is Big Business

BYLINE: By SALLY JOHNSON 

 BODY:
At age 45, Lea Rasabi acquired a passion for peegee hydrangeas. Like a teen-ager with a crush, she drove along the streets of her Queens neighborhood this summer, coveting the treelike shrubs that bloom luxuriantly in August. She wanted one for her yard.
A year ago, Mrs. Rasabi hardly knew a petunia from a peony. But she and her husband had just bought their first house, and for the first time, she was developing a sense of, well, roots. 
 "I'm obsessed," she admitted, glancing at the growing pile of gardening books and magazines on her family-room floor. "I want to know everything there is to know. And I want to know it now."
The baby-boom generation embraced gardening in the 80's as millions of first-time home buyers set about decorating their yards as well as houses. Now the huge generation is fueling a new, potentially bigger, expansion for the industry. Older boomers find themselves with more time and money for hobbies, as their children leave home, even as others like Mrs. Rasabi are still buying first houses and filling them with flowers, herbs and imported Italian pots.
Baby boomers' discovery of the virtues of family and home as they settled down was behind much of a near doubling of lawn-and-garden spending, from $12.0 billion in 1985 to $22.2 billion in 1995. But their penchant for following fashion in all aspects of life helped retailers by adding teak furniture and goat skin gloves to the basic inventory of plants and tools in catalogues and garden centers.
In a marketplace where discounters, catalogues and even grocery superstores are crowding independent nurseries, the clearest gains are among home-center chains like Home Depot, Lowe's and Builders Supply and Lumber, which offer less selection but low prices. Builders Supply is a unit of the Pulte Corporation.
Yet in a business where convenience and expert advice can count as much as price, local garden centers appear to be holding their own. And upscale catalogues like Smith & Hawken plan to grow alongside their customers' appreciation of the joys of fine gardening.
"Our research shows that the fastest-growing group is the group we call decorators," said Kathy Tierney, president of Smith & Hawken, which mails 10 million to 13 million catalogues a year. "That's why we've added things like lighting, furniture and practical clothing. It's the values of gardeners that we want to appeal to: quality, patience, long-term commitment."
From the 1980's on, the new generation of homeowners and parents eschewed the vegetable patches and marigolds of their parents for the more sophisticated perennial borders of England and the subtle, pleasing textures of Oriental gardens.
"They choose gardens with an esthetic appeal: perennial borders, herb gardens, edible landscaping," said Will Raap, president of Gardener's Supply Inc., the largest mail-order supplier of gardening equipment and tools. "The core movement was about gardens as a form of personal expression, gardens that were smaller than before but far more complex."
Complexity equated to market opportunity. In only five years lawn and garden retail sales grew 75 percent, to $20 billion in 1990, before recession temporarily slowed growth, according to the National Gardening Association, based in Burlington, Vt., which conducts monthly and annual household surveys.
The association's research director, Bruce Butterfield, predicts similar growth in the next few years as the baby-boom generation ages.
"Our research indicates that people show an increased interest in gardening in their 50's, and right now in this country, one baby boomer is turning 50 every 7 seconds," he said.
Another factor is people in their early 30's, bringing up the rear of the generation, who have just bought homes and started families, said Chris Little, president of the Meredith Publishing Group in Des Moines, which publishes Better Homes and Gardens and other home and gardening magazines.
"We see that younger group as being particularly interested in enhancing the value of their homes," Mr. Little said. "Then, too, you're seeing a societywide trend toward more concern about home and family."
He sees gardening themes turning up in advertisements for everything from windows and home furnishings to cars and over-the-counter medications. "Obviously, it means that lots of market researchers are picking up the trend," he said.
In 1979 David Smith and Paul Hawken began importing English gardening tools and selling them by catalogue from Mill Valley, Calif. Benefiting from the time-starved 80's, catalogues like Smith & Hawken flourished, growing at twice the rate of the retail industry as a whole.
Now, with at least two dozen catalogues dedicated to gardening, mail-order companies are testing a variety of strategies to stand out from the pack. Smith & Hawken, which was sold in 1993 to the CML Corporation, which also owns Nordic Track, was one of the first to add clothing, furniture and decorating accessories. Its other strategy has been to open 21 retail stores in the last three years, in affluent suburbs and city neighborhoods from lush Bellevue, Wash., to arty SoHo and genteel New Canaan, Conn.
"Our business is now half and half, catalogue and retail," Ms. Tierney said. "We're finding that our customers in urban areas are younger than the average. We're hiring knowledgeable staff and holding in-store events. We're looking for solutions for people who are time-impoverished."
The 13-year-old Gardener's Supply, based in Burlington, Vt., on the other hand, has decided against the retail strategy. Instead, Mr. Raap said, his solution, still in the formative stages, is to create gardening networks.
"We're looking at expanding our wholesale operation so that we can help out nurseries and garden centers at the same time we're helping ourselves," he said. "We're also looking at strategic collaborations with catalogues that don't duplicate our products -- maybe a seed or bulb catalogue or a company like White Flower Farm that sells high-quality plant material."
Another idea, he said, is to develop a network of gardening experts, who would double as distributors of Gardener's Supply products. They would be trained through a master gardening course the company has started with the University of Guelph in Ontario for use at home. It will be offered beginning in January.
Such plans pose little competitive threat to small independent nurseries and garden centers; indeed they might help them if the partnerships work. By contrast, the newest and most feared players in the industry are the megastores, from mass merchandisers like Wal-Mart Stores to national and regional home centers like Home Depot, based in Atlanta, and the Orchard Supply Hardware Corp., based in San Jose, Calif., which Sears, Roebuck recently bought to expand its hardware business into California.
"Garden retailers are being eaten alive by mass merchants," Mr. Raap said.
Surveys by the National Gardening Association show, for example, that 18 million households bought gardening supplies in home centers in 1995, compared with just 10 million in 1985. During that time, the number of households shopping at local garden centers rose only slightly to 32 million, from 30 million, while catalogue shoppers increased to 8 million in 1990, from 5 million in 1985, and then fell to 7 million in 1995.
Many people, of course, spread their purchases among catalogues, their local nursery and chain stores.
Katrina Blauvelt, a spokeswomen for Home Depot, said the company has been in the lawn-and-garden business since its founding in 1978. Now, all 465 stores in the United States and Canada have 28,000-square-foot lawn-and-garden centers that sell everything from fruit trees to fence posts; in addition, tools like rakes and shovels are sold inside the store.
"People are doing everything from planting window boxes and house plants to putting in fish ponds and garden paths," Ms. Blauvelt said. "Our customers include everybody from beginners to very experienced gardeners."
Megastores have unquestionably made life harder in the 1990's for merchants such as Ronald Keil, owner of Keil Brothers in Bayside, Queens, where Mrs. Rasabi shopped for hydrangeas on a sunny morning. She enlisted the help of Alex Lavy, a patient and knowledgeable young employee, who cheerfully answered a long list of questions.
Keil Brothers has been in Queens for 66 years, Mr. Keil said. He believes it will continue to thrive, in part because of employees like Alex.
"Sure, the big chains are directly impacting our business," Mr. Keil said. "You can buy plants and cut flowers in every supermarket now. So we have to have better selection, better quality and better service. We have to offer our customers the newest introductions in plant material, the most disease-resistant, hardiest varieties."
Beyond that, he said, the key to survival is service. "We try to answer their questions as best we can," he said, "and we always try to have a big smile on our faces."

Charts: "Garden Chic"
Baby boomers' interest in gardening has fueled the growth of both specialty catalogues and mass merchants' nursery centers. Retailers have added teak furniture and goat skin gloves to their basic inventory of plants and tools. Below are some of the items for sale in gardening catalogues: Canvas tool bag, $55. Copper watering can, $65. Garden clogs, $38. (pg. 37)

HEADLINE: Family Income Finally Rises

 BODY:
The upbeat report by the Census Bureau this week on family incomes and poverty showed that the recovery is finally raising living standards for American families, rich and poor. Income of the typical household rose by almost 3 percent last year, the largest increase in a decade. For the typical black family, income last year was $3,000 higher than in 1992. Poverty rates fell, with the percentage of blacks in poverty, 29.3 percent, falling to its lowest level since data were first collected in 1959. Child poverty fell faster than in any year since the mid-1970's. Even the nation's stubbornly high level of inequality fell more last year than in any year since the late 1960's.
Ordinarily, there would be nothing surprising about rising income and falling poverty in the fifth year of a recovery. But for too long this recovery was "jobless," producing meager gains in living standards. Even now wages are nearly stagnant. But at least in the past two years, employment has taken off. Family income is rising because more people are working and those who work are putting in longer hours. 
 The recent gains, though welcome, ought to be kept in perspective. Poverty would have to fall four more years at last year's rate just to reach the level that was achieved 23 years ago. Black poverty last year, the lowest in recorded history, remains far worse than white poverty. Family incomes are rising, but remain below 1989 levels for all but the richest. Inequality has fallen for two years, but the average income of families in the bottom 20 percent is only one-twentieth as high as the average income of families in the top 5 percent. Child poverty remains at an obscenely high 20 percent.
Peering into the future, Congress made matters needlessly worse. The welfare bill that it passed, and the President signed, will throw millions of children and adults into poverty. Just as the economy opens the door to prosperity for families, rich and poor, Congress has slammed the door back shut for the most disadvantaged.

HEADLINE: Blue Chips End 4.07 Higher In an Uninspired Session

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks drifted higher near the close yesterday, but the lethargic tone that took hold earlier in the week continued as investors awaited new incentives to extend its late summer rally into early autumn.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.07 points, to 5,872.92, pulling higher in the final minutes after meandering in negative territory for most of the session. The small gain cut the Dow's loss on the week to 15.54 points. 
 Broader measures also finished higher, with technology and speculative shares outperforming blue-chip issues throughout the day. But without any big news again, trading remained lifeless in the aftermath to Tuesday's decision by Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates.
"It has been a very unenthusiastic session," said Eugene Peroni, director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. "Investors are focusing on the individual stories rather than the overall market or the overall economy."
Mr. Peroni said the slow grind since Tuesday has been constructive. "It seems to be arresting the excesses that cropped up before Tuesday and reduces the need and likelihood for a deep and sustained drop," he said.
The Fed's decision had validated optimism that economic growth was slowing enough to avoid an increase in interest rates that would be sharper and sooner than expected. The news cheered bond traders. But the stock market had already rallied to record levels in anticipation of Tuesday's Fed meeting.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.33 point, to 686.19. The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.07, to 1,230.05.
Pepsico, down 2 1/8, to 28 1/8, was the most active issue on the Big Baord after announcing on Thursday that it was overhauling its international soft drink operations and considering selling some restaurants.
The Dow's biggest gainer was General Electric, which rose 1 1/8, to 91 1/2, on reports of a Goldman, Sachs upgrade. Walt Disney rose 1, to 63.

HEADLINE: Japan's Premier Calls Elections for October

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 27

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto dissolved Parliament today, setting the stage for new national elections that may reconfigure Japanese politics.
Mr. Hashimoto's party is expected to do well in the elections, which will be held on Oct. 20, and most bets are that he will remain Prime Minister. But his party may not win a majority, meaning that he would have to form a new coalition that could help set off a political realignment. 
 These elections are regarded as particularly important because they will be the first under a new voting system that is expected to mean the extinction of some small parties and a reduction in the importance of conservative rural voters. Under the new system, for the first time since 1924 Japanese will elect a single legislator from each district, as in the United States.
"The time has come to ask for the people's support in determining how to guide Japan into the future," Mr. Hashimoto declared.
"The battle is at hand," he added, "and I want to give our every effort to win."
Mr. Hashimoto could have waited until next summer to call an election, but the opposition is now in disarray and his Liberal Democratic Party is doing relatively well in the polls. It is benefiting from a slowly reviving economy and a sense that Mr. Hashimoto has moved to resolve problems with American bases in Okinawa.
To be sure, Mr. Hashimoto has not lived up to the enthusiasm that greeted him when he took office in January, seeming young and dynamic by the standards of Japanese politics. But if voter attitudes toward the 59-year-old Mr. Hashimoto are lukewarm, they are positively cool to the main opposition leader, Ichiro Ozawa, head of the New Frontier Party.
"This is an election on which we are staking the very existence of the New Frontier Party," Mr. Ozawa told party members today. "More important, this is also an election on which we are staking the possibility of securing Japan's future and public happiness for the new generation."
A recent poll by the Nihon Keizai newspaper found 22 percent support for the Liberal Democrats and only 7 percent for New Frontier. A full 49 percent were undecided, and a surprising 8 percent said they would support a new party, the Democrats.
The Democratic Party, which is to be formally introduced on Saturday, is trying to emerge as the leading force for change in Japan, appealing to voters who are weary of corrupt and tired politicians who seem to be manipulated by the bureaucracy. It is led by Yukio Hatoyama, the scion of a wealthy political family who is sometimes compared to President Kennedy, and Naoto Kan, the energetic Health Minister and perhaps the most popular politician in Japan.
Because it is so new, the Democratic Party is a wild card in the election, and it could emerge with the balance of power in a coalition. It is conceivable, though unlikely, that it could win enough seats to insist on the prime minister's job in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats.
Politicians say that the new electoral system makes the outcome difficult to forecast, but that the most likely outcome is that the Liberal Democrats will dominate a coalition. This would probably mean policies similar to the present ones.
"I think it's going to be a coalition very much along the lines of what we have now," said John F. Neuffer, a specialist on Japanese politics at Mitsui Marine Research Institute in Tokyo. In any case, he noted, there are few major differences among the political parties.
"Basically, everybody agrees on all of the issues," he said. "This is a largely issue-less campaign."
The one topic that has aroused some interest is whether the national sales tax should be raised as scheduled in April from 3 percent to 5 percent. Voters are opposed to the tax increase, and so the opposition is trying to make an issue of it.
The opposition is also calling for major administrative reform, including a dramatic reduction in the number of government ministries. But since all the major parties are calling for this, even the governing Liberal Democrats, voters seem skeptical of all the proposals.
In the old electoral system, Japanese elected several legislators from each district. But now 300 legislators will be chosen in single-seat constituencies, with just one member of Parliament for each district. An additional 200 legislators will be chosen by proportional representation based on votes for each party.
The combination of the new system and the surly voter mood is expected to be nearly fatal for the Social Democratic Party, which recently changed its name from the Socialist Party in a desperate attempt to broaden its appeal. The Socialists were the main opposition party for most of postwar Japanese history, but they seem to be fragmenting and may not survive much longer.
"Our identity as an independent party has not become clear, and we have provoked criticism and distrust," the Social Democrats' leader, Tomiichi Murayama, said today. "But we've had some calls of support just now, and we've got to win in this election at all cost."

HEADLINE: 2d-Quarter Growth Was Most in 2 Years

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 27

 BODY:
The economy accelerated at a 4.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter, the fastest in two years, but analysts say the growth has now downshifted to about half that pace.
"Third-quarter G.D.P. growth appears to have slowed sharply from the second-quarter pace," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist for Merrill Lynch & Company. "We believe that G.D.P. rose at just a 1.5 percent to 2 percent rate in the third quarter." 
 The G.D.P., or gross domestic product, is the total output of goods and services within the United States. It advanced at a 2 percent rate during the January-March quarter after an anemic rise of three-tenths of 1 percent in the final three months of 1995.
But growth took off in the April-June quarter, racing ahead at the fastest pace since a 4.9 percent increase during the second quarter of 1994, the Commerce Department said today.
The second-quarter figure was in line with analysts' expectations. The first official figures for the third quarter, which ends Monday, will not be available for another month.
The bond market rose sharply after the report was released. Analysts said the market reflected growing agreement that the economy had moderated since spring and was not in need of an increase in interest rates to curb inflation.
And even though recent data suggest a slowdown in growth, analysts agree that the economy remains sound.
"There's enough fuel in the economy in terms of income growth, employment gain, stock market strength and overall consumer confidence to boost consumer spending in the important Christmas quarter," said Lynn Reaser, an economist for Barnett Banks in Jacksonville, Fla. She foresees a growth rate of 2 percent to 3 percent during the October-December period.
Federal Reserve policy makers apparently agree that the economy has moderated since the second quarter. At their Tuesday meeting, they left interest rates unchanged. There had been speculation that the Fed panel might raise rates in an attempt to slow the economy and head off any surge of inflation.
An index of inflation reported in today's G.D.P. figures supports the belief that little inflation exists. The index rose 2.1 percent, even slower than the 2.3 percent increase in the previous three months.
"The second quarter was the best of all worlds: low inflation and strong growth," Ms. Reaser said.
But some investors in stocks may not agree. The report also showed that corporate after-tax profits fell two-tenths of 1 percent, or $700 million, the first drop since a fall of five-tenths of 1 percent a year earlier.
However, most major components shared in the second-quarter growth.
Consumer spending, two-thirds of economic activity, spurted ahead at a 3.4 percent rate, virtually the same as the first quarter's 3.5 percent.
Housing was up at a 16.3 percent rate, more than twice the 7.4 percent pace from January through March.
Renewed inventory building added $10.1 billion to the G.D.P. in the second quarter, after businesses liquidated stockpiles in the first, subtracting $17.6 billion from the January-March G.D.P.
Government spending grew at a 7.7 percent rate, up from 1.6 percent in the previous quarter.
The trade deficit, however, remained a drag in the second quarter. It subtracted $10.7 billion from the G.D.P., although that was down from $19.1 billion in the first quarter.
Business investments, a major source of strength earlier, slowed to a 3.8 percent growth rate, from 11.6 percent in the first quarter.
The various changes left total G.D.P. at an annualized $6.89 trillion, after adjusting for inflation, compared with $6.81 trillion in the January-March quarter.

HEADLINE: For Canadians, Is U.S. Gaze Friendly?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Sept. 27

 BODY:
A hearing before a United States Congressional committee this week that bluntly assessed what a breakup of Canada would mean for the United States attracted little attention in Washington. But it reverberated loudly here, leaving many Canadians either flattered by the attention or resentful of outside interference.
The hearing on Wednesday before the House Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere focused on the security and economic implications of a secession by Quebec. 
 "Here it hadn't really sunk in yet that the country almost broke apart and may still do so," said Mel Watkins, a professor of Canadian Studies at the University of Toronto. Having the unraveling of Canada laid out in a Washington hearing room, Professor Watkins said, made Canadians pay attention in a way they never would have if the same arguments had been made in Ottawa.
The hearing, broadcast in Canada and covered extensively by local newspapers, made many Canadians sqirm, especially in Quebec, as witnesses described the chaos that could follow if Quebec voted to pull out of Canada, which almost happened last October, to Washington's surprise.
And some thought the United States should mind its own business. "An exercise that is off the charts on the paranoia index," is how a CBC commentator described the hearing.
"When big brother takes an interest, it can go both ways," said Alan W. Sullivan, president of the Canadian Institute of International Affairs, an independent organization in Toronto. "The United States is such an important player in the Canadian psyche that it grates on Canadian nerves when the United States does pay attention to us, as well as when it doesn't pay attention to us."
The United States has considered Quebec a strictly domestic issue for Canada, its most important trading partner.
But the Congressman who organized the hearing, Tom Campbell, a Republican from California, argued that the United States was not paying enough attention to what was going on north of the border. He said the North American Free Trade Agreement raised direct issues for the United States, like whether an independent Quebec would automatically be allowed to join Nafta.
A view presented several times at the hearing was that admission for sovereign Quebec would not be automatic, and that by stating so clearly, Washington would help the people of the province understand the consequences of secession.
One witness, Charles F. Doran, had already raised tempers in Canada with an article published this month in Foreign Affairs magazine speculating on the future of Canada. Mr. Doran, a Distinguished Professor of International Relations at Johns Hopkins University, argued that if Quebec seceded, Canada would unravel.
The poor eastern provinces of Canada would be physically cut off from the rest of the country, he wrote, and the wealthier western provinces would have little incentive to remain in a union that subsidizes the poor provinces, or gives too much power and control to Ontario, the most populous of the 10 provinces.
Professor Doran speculated that Alberta, a sparsely populated prairie province, might even try to apply for statehood with the United States. That prompted this headline in The Financial Post, a Toronto daily: "Give us your poor, your tired, your huddled masses -- and Alberta."
Many Canadian newspapers welcomed the hearings because of the perception that Washington could analyze the Quebec issue without the histrionics it raises in Canada. But there was also some embarrassment over the airing of Canada's internal problems in Washington.
Neither the United States State Department nor the Canadian Government sent any representatives to testify. In fact, no Canadians testified at all; the four witnesses were all Americans.
"In a way it was a classic Canadian-American story, filled with a lot of absurdities," Professor Watkins said. "There it was, a hearing about Canada, with no Canadians testifying. And though it was supposed to be for the benefit of the United States, the hearing room was filled with only Canadian journalists."

HEADLINE: Rally Runs Out of Fresh Data, And Bond Prices Take a Dip

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The recent rise in prices of Treasury securities stalled yesterday, in the absence of strong fresh data.
The 30-year bond fell 8/32 , to a price of 983/32 to yield 6.90 percent, up from 6.88 percent on Thursday. 
 The reports issued yesterday included the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment, which edged lower this month, to 94.7, from 95 in the midmonth report and 95.3 in August. Also, there was a slight downward revision in the second-quarter growth of gross domestic product, a development that provided some support for a market looking for a deceleration of growth in the months ahead.
Stuart D. Taylor, president of Taylor Consulting Inc. in Little Rock, Ark., is not overly bullish about the current bond market. "One thing I've learned over 14 years of trading bonds is to pay attention to my hunches," he said. "The idea that the market is ready to move significantly higher just doesn't feel right."
He noted that the market had passed a variety of technical tests and that prices of industrial commodities were turning supportive for bonds, "but at this stage I would have to classify myself as uncomfortable with an overly bullish opinion," he said.
Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisers, said the market action reflected more of a pause than an abandonment of the view that the economy is slowing enough to justify the Federal Reserve's decision on Tuesday to leave interest rates unchanged.
"While moments before the Fed meeting ended, a broad spectrum of market participants were braced for a token tightening, today we are seeing a virtual 180-degree turn," Mr. Chan said. "More and more investors are now even beginning to openly discuss that the next Fed move could actually be an easing."
At the very least, he suggested, the Fed should be able to keep monetary policy on hold until inflation shows up in the Consumer Price Index.
Mr. Chan said that next week would be a blockbuster in terms of economic news. He said the market would first focus on the report from purchasing managers in the Chicago area to see how much that index gives back after it surged to 60 last month from 51.2 in July.
A drop in the index of less than a couple of points could stir some concern that the weak durable goods number released on Thursday might have overstated the general trend in manufacturing. That in turn would suggest that the report from the National Association of Purchasing Management, to be released on Tuesday, will be stronger, as could the manufacturing component of the September employment report, due on Friday.
Mr. Chan said that aside from the nonfarm payroll reading in the jobs report, investors would be watching to see if the apparent slowdown in the economy was affecting the figures on average hourly earnings.
"Any monthly average hourly earnings readings that come even close to last month's five-tenths of a percent sizable increase could threaten the most bullish sentiment that is currently permeating the market," he said.

HEADLINE: AMERICAN PROFILES -- Alabama;
Alabama Voters Waver Between Old Principles And a New Prosperity

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: GADSDEN, Ala., Sept. 23

 BODY:
The people of Etowah County, explains the Rev. Aaron Johnson, the preacher at the First Baptist Church of Gadsden, are a little bit different. In their distinctly Southern way, they are a tad mistrustful, a bit suspicious. Even in the best of times, it seems, they fear that distant forces may be conspiring to take their jobs and undermine their values.
Maybe, Mr. Johnson suggests, it is all the talk out of Washington about gun control and gay marriages. Maybe it is because even in the best of times, the economy of this blue-collar city of 45,000 people in northeastern Alabama never quite feels secure. 
 The steel mill has been sold and sold and sold again, three times in a dozen years. With contract talks approaching at the Goodyear factory, the plant manager has distributed an ominous letter warning employees of a "crisis" caused by global competition. Memories linger of the old Dwight Cotton Mill, which was closed by a strike in 1959 and then stood abandoned for 20 years as a reminder of the capriciousness of life.
"They're skeptical, untrusting, almost as if there's a feeling of paranoia," Mr. Johnson said of the members of his congregation. "I made the statement from the pulpit one day that 'just because you're not paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you.' And nobody laughed. I may have gotten a few 'amens' on that, but nobody laughed."
Inevitably in a campaign year, that skepticism and uncertainty seeps into the region's politics.
It is not simply that people here are unenthusiastic about their choices, which many describe as being between the lesser of two evils. It is that they are struggling to sort out conflicting impulses. Unlike the old days, when there was only one party in Alabama, voters here, as throughout the state and much of the South, have found that the party that is best for their pocketbooks is not always best for their principles.
They are weighing their often disdainful feelings for President Clinton against the relative prosperity of their lives under a Democratic Administration. They are drawn to the conservative values embraced by the Republican Party, but are uninspired by its standard-bearer, Bob Dole.
When they read the headlines, they see their principles under assault. Down at the county courthouse, lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union are trying to force Judge Roy Moore of the Circuit Court to remove the Ten Commandments from the wall of his courtroom. When he is not on trial himself, Judge Moore is hearing the divorce case of a lesbian who is seeking custody of her child.
And yet, times are about as good here as they have been in recent memory. The county's unemployment rate is now at 5.1 percent, down from 14 percent in 1984, and is the lowest in 20 years. Sales tax revenue has increased by an average of 15 percent a year for the last five years.
At Gulf States Steel, the second-largest employer in Gadsden, it has been three years since the last round of downsizing. Workers are being paid an average of $17 an hour, and last year they received nearly $5,000 each in profit sharing.
Steven G. Blackwell, a burly young steelworker from nearby Collinsville, used his profit-sharing money to buy lumber for the house he is building. He gives the President much of the credit for the health of the economy.
But in a state where cultural conservatism reigns and character counts, Mr. Blackwell has deep reservations about Mr. Clinton -- about his integrity, about his alleged marital infidelity, about his smoking marijuana, about his support for abortion rights, about "those shady Whitewater dealings."
"He has no morals whatsoever," Mr. Blackwell said of the President.
And so, after voting Republican in the last two Presidential elections, Mr. Blackwell finds himself wavering between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole.
"I never thought I would see the day," he said, shaking his head as he lumbered toward the mill gate to start a 3 P.M. to 11 P.M. shift.
Another steelworker, C. T. Abney, who has worked at the mill for 32 of his 54 years, said the economy had persuaded him to vote Democratic.
"If the economy went bad, I probably wouldn't vote for Clinton," Mr. Abney said. "Some of these moral issues I don't like, like this gay business. I don't give a flip for that. But right now the good outweighs the bad."
That Mr. Blackwell, Mr. Abney and other white, blue-collar workers would even consider voting for Mr. Clinton is a somewhat remarkable development. They are exactly the kind of voters who have transformed Alabama into a reliably Republican state in recent years.
But like the steelworkers, Alabamians interviewed across the state last week -- whether at a coffee shop in Birmingham, a feed barn in Snead or an outlet mall in Boaz -- often had difficulty reconciling their optimism about a stable economy with their contempt for declining standards of morality.
They rarely expressed anxiety about the economy and almost never volunteered any interest in tax cuts, the centerpiece of Mr. Dole's economic plan. They voiced amorphous fears that cutting the size of the Federal Government would endanger the elderly and threaten jobs in agriculture, the military and NASA, all major employers in Alabama.
But they also were quick to criticize the Clinton Administration about its moral tone. Many volunteered particularly strong feelings about homosexuality, a subject they tie directly to Mr. Clinton because of his support for allowing lesbians and gay men to serve openly in the military.
"I don't agree with it, giving gays rights in the workplace," said Wayne Ragsdale, a 60-year-old mechanic from Allgood. "If God had meant for two of the same sex to be all right together, he wouldn't have made the other one."
The politics of culture and values is vital in Alabama. Natalie Davis, a Democratic political scientist at Birmingham Southern College, said her "fundamental axiom about Alabama politics is that we vote for people we like, not necessarily people we agree with."
That helps explain why the State Attorney General, Jefferson B. Sessions 3d, the Republican nominee for the Senate, took along both a former Vice President, Dan Quayle (family values), and a former stock car racer, Bobby Allison (Southern culture), on a bus tour of Alabama last week. At a few stops Mr. Quayle actually won more applause than Mr. Allison.
With the exception of Jimmy Carter in 1976, no Democratic Presidential candidate has carried Alabama since John F. Kennedy in 1960. Mr. Clinton has not stepped foot in the state since April 1992. The Governor, a United States Senator and three of the state's seven members of Congress are Republicans.
In January, 10 Democratic judges from Birmingham defected to the Republican Party en masse. And when a special election for sheriff was held in Birmingham this year, the Democrats did not even field a candidate.
History suggests that the President and the Democratic Senate nominee, State Senator Roger H. Bedford, should be considered underdogs this fall. But the most recent polls indicate that both the Presidential race and the Senate campaign are closely contested.
The numbers do not suggest that Alabamians are growing less conservative. Rather, they reflect the ability of Democratic politicians to outrun accusations of liberalism by embracing all manner of conservative positions and by speaking unceasingly about their "Alabama values."
To distinguish itself from the national Democrats, the Alabama Democratic Party adopted its own platform this year, stating that schools should not be hostile to any child's religious belief, emphasizing its support for the death penalty and acknowledging the right of Democrats to differ on such issues as abortion and gun control.
Mr. Bedford boasts of voting for Ronald Reagan in 1980. He opposes abortion rights and allowing homosexuals to serve in the military, describes himself as a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, favors repeal of the ban on assault weapons and says he would have voted for strict time limits on welfare benefits. Asked in an interview what makes him a Democrat, he replied, "I believe in helping people."
Cultural conservatism is so deeply entrenched here that candidates of both parties seem as eager to profess their faith in Jesus as their opposition to gun control.
In his stump speech, Mr. Bedford, a 40-year-old lawyer from Russelville, makes a point of describing his prayerful recovery from lymphoma in 1990, and how it nurtured a "strong belief in God." Mr. Sessions, who is 49 and from Mobile, is broadcasting a television commercial in which he testifies: "I believe in fundamental values. I believe there is truth. I believe there are principles which are unchanging, that there is a God in heaven who orders the universe."
Back at the First Baptist Church, Mr. Johnson, a loyal Republican, can appreciate that sentiment. But he also acknowledges that the economic edginess in Gadsden may lead people to vote Democratic.
"The question," he said, "is how far will they go with the Democrats if the Democrats leave their morality? How much is their job security worth?"

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
Dole 'Listens to America,' And Hears Press Criticism

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 27

 BODY:
When Bob Dole arrived on Thursday here in Dade County, the population center of a state his aides believe he must win but where polls show him trailing, he made only a single campaign stop, for a 42-minute question-and-answer forum at a huge and gritty warehouse in the northwest corner of Miami.
This was the 15th in a series of "Listening to America" sessions that Mr. Dole has led since he was nominated for President six weeks ago. The loosely structured forums, often on a particular topic like his economic plan, have become a dominant component of Mr. Dole's effort to unseat President Clinton, taking up far more time than he devotes to major policy addresses and even rivaling the time he spends at more customary political rallies. 
 As he embarks on the final weeks of what his campaign organization views as an increasingly problematic race, however, Mr. Dole's experience with the "Listening to America" format suggests that its value to his bid for the Presidency remains far from proven.
Mr. Dole's aides maintain that the events afford him the kind of favorable coverage from local news media that the candidate says he has not found in the national press.
"It may well bore elite reporters," John Buckley, the nominee's communications director, said of the format. "But it does get covered, and we create news on topics that we are interested in creating news on."
But the coverage by newspapers and television stations here in the aftermath of Mr. Dole's visit, as in other places where he has taken his "Listening to America" tour, suggests otherwise. Miami news organizations either were critical of Thursday's event in their accounts or, perhaps worse, nearly ignored it.
"The questions were mostly softballs, but even then Dole didn't always connect," Michael Putney, a veteran political reporter for the ABC affiliate here, told his viewers in his evening report on Thursday.
None of the Miami television stations led their early-evening newscasts with Mr. Dole's appearance. One devoted just 30 seconds to it. Another relegated it to the bottom of the news lineup, after reports on the resurgence of Pan Am and Valujet, a high school student's unsuccessful effort to blow up his mathematics teachers and a traffic accident on Interstate 95.
All the television reports on Mr. Dole's visit focused on his political difficulties rather than on his message, and portrayed the forums themselves as staged. This morning The Miami Herald put its account on the front page -- of the second section.
Beyond the campaign's objective of local coverage, Mr. Dole regularly points to these events as an opportunity for him to hear the unfiltered views of Americans ordinarily little involved in the political process. But here, as has been typical elsewhere, the audience had been stocked by local Republican leaders, and those present were for the most part gentle in their handling of him.
The theme of the forum was women in business, and by design the audience was all women, mostly Cuban-Americans. Interviews with some of them -- before a Dole aide ordered a reporter to stop talking to them and leave the floor -- also suggested that they were nearly all Republicans who supported Mr. Dole.
The nominee's aides say these are the kind of easy-to-arrange, photographically alluring events that win attention for candidates. But even Mr. Dole's supporters question the value of having him pose for pictures, as in this case, in a warehouse with stacks of plastic containers behind him and cases of Heinz Worcestershire sauce in front of him. Further, said one former Dole media adviser, Mike Murphy, who left the campaign in a recent shake-up, the candidate's organization needs to make the forums "more newsworthy and less sterile."
Mr. Dole's difficulties with the "Listening to America" forums might be less significant had he not invested so large a share of his relatively modest campaign schedule in them. From the start, the events have been a subject of fairly critical newspaper accounts that have portrayed them as staged and suggested that rather than giving Mr. Dole a taste of the country's concerns, they simply echo the nominee's own views. "Doggone it," Susan Feeney wrote in The Dallas Morning News, "Mr. Dole was 'listening to America,' and it sounded a lot like him."
Mr. Buckley, the Dole campaign's communications director, dismisses such news accounts as an example of "elite reporters' having to show off." In fact, though, similar criticism can be seen and heard in smaller media markets' local coverage as well.
And it appears to have rankled the candidate. When the forum here opened with a question about his tax cut proposal, Mr. Dole, who has not held a formal news conference since March, devoted part of his answer to something else, remarking with evident irritation that he understood that a newspaper reporter had been inquiring as to how this event had come about.
"I know somebody was here earlier," he said, "some reporter saying: 'Well, these are all the same. Who's going to do this? Who's going to do that?'
"He must have left disappointed, because it's not staged, not rehearsed. We're here to talk about America."
The woman whose question led to that response was Alina Garcia, a beauty salon owner, who said she had been invited to the forum after calling friends on the local Republican committee.
Mr. Dole embarked on these sessions after the Republican National Convention, and they are clearly patterned on the performance there by his wife, Elizabeth. But where Mrs. Dole took a hand-held microphone and wandered comfortably through the audience for her chat, her husband customarily stays settled in his chair, occasionally rising to answer questions but evincing none of the same level of ease with this kind of campaign banter.
Such events are nothing new in American politics. Richard M. Nixon was among the first to use them. As early as 1979, George Bush, in his own quest for the Presidency, was conducting "Ask George Bush" forums, in which he sat on a stool in the middle of a community assembly. And Mr. Clinton made them a regular part of his 1992 campaign.
But as Marlin Fitzwater, press secretary in the Bush White House, noted the other day, the approach has varied over the years. In 1992, President Bush, following Mr. Clinton's lead, began holding such forums in local television studios. The advantage was that doing so dramatically expanded the audience; the disadvantage, as Mr. Fitzwater recalled, was that the television stations helped choose those attending.
Mr. Murphy, the former Dole media adviser, said that before leaving the campaign he had urged that the nominee adopt the studio approach. But the campaign stayed with untelevised forums.
Here in Miami, the audience was selected by both the campaign and a longtime Dole supporter, Remedios Diaz Oliver, the president of All American Containers Inc., whose warehouse was the setting for the event.
One in attendance, Pamela Wilde-Cole, told Mr. Dole, "I believe that the difference between Hillary and Bill and you and Liddy is character, is decency, honor and character."
At that, those in Mr. Dole's "Listening to America" audience burst into applause and, as one, rose to their feet to end the session with a prolonged standing ovation.

HEADLINE: MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT: IN WASHINGTON;
Limits on U.S. Leverage: The Needs of Both Sides

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

 BODY:
The armed clashes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian police officers, which have deeply shaken assumptions about lasting peace in the Middle East, have also shaken the Clinton Administration, which was looking for a quiet life in foreign policy until the Presidential election.
In the last few days, State Department officials have worked around the clock, in person and by telephone, to try to bring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel together with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, possibly within a day, in a meeting that might produce calm in the streets and something positive for both sides. 
 But the United States finds itself with unusually little leverage on the Israelis, part of the price Washington is paying for its fruitless efforts this year to secure the election of Mr. Netanyahu's Labor Party rival, Shimon Peres. Given Mr. Netanyahu's skepticism of Washington's real intentions and given the American election campaign, American influence on the Israeli Government is probably as low as it has been since Yitzhak Shamir, the previous Prime Minister from Mr. Netanyahu's right-wing Likud Party, opened a new West Bank settlement on the eve of every chilly visit to Washington.
Mr. Netanyahu, while open to American suggestions and telephone calls, has already rejected American advice to reseal the tunnel that runs parallel to the Western Wall, at least temporarily. And he has rebuffed suggestions that Secretary of State Warren Christopher or his Middle East envoy, Dennis Ross, make a quick visit to the Middle East. Mr. Netanyahu is setting his own pace and looking first to his own conservative domestic constituents.
Despite the enormous potential leverage that the United States has over Israel -- from $3 billion a year in aid to important sharing of military and security intelligence -- no American Administration, Democratic or Republican, wants to pick a fight with Israel during an election year. It is one reason that President Clinton himself has delegated the problem to Mr. Christopher, and has not himself engaged in any telephone diplomacy, let alone rush to Israel, as he did after the suicide bombings this spring, to offer his support.
But there is also a real question of whether any serious confrontation with Israel would produce the result Washington wants, especially in this case, when Mr. Netanyahu feels that any indication of weakness on his part, or the least bow to foreign pressure, could bring down his already fractious Government.
Mr. Arafat, too, is being careful, American officials say. He does not want to be pressured by the Americans into a meeting with Mr. Netanyahu that produces nothing. Having promoted the Palestinian protests about the Israeli decision to open another entrance to an archeological tunnel along the Haram al-Sharif or Temple Mount, Mr. Arafat lost control of the demonstrations and even control of a number of his own Palestinian police.
Mr. Arafat does not want to be pushed into giving orders for calm that could be ignored or that turn out to produce no Israeli concessions, a senior American official suggested, and thus undermine him instead of letting him consolidate some of the political gain the violence has secured him.
"Using leverage isn't about whether you can force one side or another into doing something," the official said. "Force doesn't produce real commitments, and it would cost us in the long run. We have to be viewed as a useful, reliable interlocutor by both sides. That's where the real leverage comes."
American officials have largely given up on the hope that Mr. Netanyahu will shut the new tunnel entrance while an Israeli-Palestinian commission studies the problem. So the Americans are concentrating on getting Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat together in a way that can produce a more rapid carrying out of what Israel has already agreed to do under their peace accord, including the removal of most Israeli troops from the West Bank town of Hebron, and create a process and agenda for future meetings.
"It will be hard, even impossible, for Netanyahu to change his position on the tunnel," a knowledgeable official said. "But he is prepared to move on other issues that the Palestinians really want, like Hebron."
Still, the official acknowledged, "the last three days complicate what could have been done," increasing pressure on Mr. Netanyahu from his own Likud Party to offer the Palestinians nothing but the stick.
It may even be that Mr. Arafat, by promoting protests intended to increase pressure on Mr. Netanyahu before scheduled negotiations, has made it harder for the Israeli to deliver what he had planned.
"The judgments have been bad on both sides," a senior official said with frustration.
Since Mr. Netanyahu's narrow election in late May, American officials have worked hard to push him toward a serious engagement with Mr. Arafat, on the general principle that as one official said, "there is no neutral gear in the Middle East."
Lack of progress means deterioration, they believed, and they worried that Mr. Arafat could lose out to more militant elements among Palestinians unless he could show his constituents the ability to deliver at least some of their aspirations. Growing political frustration and economic pain, among Palestinians who saw no gains and felt that Mr. Arafat was being treated with contempt, was bound to explode.
But clearly progress was too slow, and now the Americans are trying to salvage what they can from a peace process Mr. Clinton hoped would smooth his way into a second term.
An Administration that has devoted such a large proportion of its diplomatic energies to the Middle East is bound to be tarred by the violence, which is itself an indication of a more general disillusion with the image of a comprehensive peace that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Peres sold so hard, and perhaps oversold, even to themselves.

HEADLINE: SUNY Tries Off-Peak Pricing At Some Struggling Campuses

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Airlines do it. Hotels do it. Phone companies do it. They all offer off-peak pricing -- discounts to customers who use their services at less crowded times.
Now the State University of New York is trying the idea at its two-year colleges, which are faced with declining enrollment at some campuses and pressures to pay more of their own way. 
 SUNY's trustees voted this week to allow 30 community colleges and 5 colleges of technology to set lower tuition for students who take courses at night, on weekends or during the summer, or who attend classes at other sites with empty seats.
It is too early yet to say how the program will work for SUNY. Some of the community colleges are expected to begin offering discounts in the spring semester, though they have yet to figure out how large the discounts will be or whether off-peak pricing will ultimately be useful.
The technology colleges have begun offering a 23 percent reduction in price this semester to part-time students taking classes at underused sites off campus, but are not yet offering lower prices on campus.
Colleges everywhere have gradually been adopting more flexible pricing systems. Many offer lower per-credit prices for programs like summer school, continuing education and weekend colleges. SUNY's decision was seen by some educators yesterday as moving a step further.
"This is an example of how market forces are coming more and more into play in higher education," said Theodore Marchese, a vice president of the American Association for Higher Education in Washington and editor of Change magazine. "There is more differential pricing today than years ago, when low tuition, independent of field or the time of study, was the rule."
The reasons for SUNY's pricing effort are varied. In some cases, the campuses are seeking to halt a slide in enrollment. But others are responding to budget cuts in Albany and to the pressure being applied by the Pataki administration to take more of a free-market approach, in which the campuses compete for resources and students. In all cases, though, the colleges are aiming the discounts at new students, not those who are already enrolled.
Private colleges and universities have generally had more freedom to change their prices and to offer adjustable prices through scholarships and other financial aid. But public colleges like SUNY generally have less flexibility, and their prices are often set by state legislatures or state boards of regents who do not always take into account the competitive needs of specific institutions.
"In private colleges, hardly any two students pay the same tuition," said Joseph L. Kennedy, president of SUNY's College of Technology at Canton, near the Thousand Islands. "In public education, you can't go case by case, you have to price by category."
William F. Massy, an economist at Stanford's Institute for Higher Education Research, said that setting lower prices at certain times "makes a lot of sense."
"When fixed-cost facilities are not being used heavily, why not charge a lower rate?" he asked. "It makes all kinds of sense to do marginal cost pricing if the facilities are lying idle and you can hire faculty."
In California, Terry Colvin, a spokesman for the office of the president at the University of California, said that people at the university would watch the SUNY plan with interest.
"One of the realities of higher education is that facilities have become the most expensive part of the operation, but on nights and weekends are 90 percent empty," he said. "When you dovetail that with projections of climbing enrollments, you reach the conclusion that either we're going to have to build new facilities or find a better use for the ones we have."
He said the university had not tried offering discounts, but instead has imposed extra fees for certain categories of students, like those in professional schools.
In 1991, for example, the university started charging medical students more than other students, and the differential has been raised each year. The fee is more than $4,000 a year above the regular student fee of $3,700 a year, and will rise even more in the future.
Under SUNY's plan, the two-year colleges would be allowed to charge lower tuition to students who attend classes on campus during off-peak hours, like evenings or weekends, or off-peak parts of the year, like summer and between terms in the winter, to encourage better use of college space. They will also be allowed to offer lower tuition to businesses or other institutions that use their sites for part-time instruction.
Each community college campus will decide on its own how to proceed.
Corning Community College will probably start next fall, said its president, Eduardo J. Marti, who said his campus has not yet decided how it will use the new freedom to set different prices for different categories of students.
"This gives us the flexibility to be more competitive," he said. "It makes sense for us to charge less to some students. It's a win-win situation, since students will benefit by being able to attend at a lower cost, and the college will benefit by hopefully having more students."
Corning's student population has fallen slightly in recent years, Dr. Marti said, from an enrollment the equivalent of 3,150 full-time students three years ago to about 3,000 now.
The five technical colleges have agreed to adopt the same pricing structures. They are starting with a program in which part-time students taking classes off campus will be charged $99 per credit, rather than the $128 they have paid.
But Mr. Kennedy at Canton said that since Corning and the other technical colleges were all residential and used their classrooms at night for their existing students, he doubted that lower prices for night classes would work for them.
Another program Canton is trying this year is lowering the rate for out-of-state students to $5,000 from $8,300 in hopes of drawing Canadians. Currently it has only a few, though it is only 55 miles from Ottawa.
"With room and board and other add-ons, $8,300 a year in tuition brought our cost close to $20,000 Canadian dollars," Mr. Kennedy said. "We're hoping that the $5,000 tuition, though it's still pretty steep, will make it more affordable. Having 50 Canadian students could bring a different flavor to our campus."

HEADLINE: Pavel Sudoplatov, 89, Dies; Top Soviet Spy Who Accused Oppenheimer

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

 BODY:
Lieut. Gen. Pavel A. Sudoplatov, a legendary Soviet spymaster who plotted and carried out assassinations with cold-blooded efficiency and claimed to have engineered the theft of atomic secrets from the United States with the aid of four eminent scientists, died Tuesday at his home in Moscow. He was 89.
General Sudoplatov had been suffering from vascular disease and recently had a stroke, Moscow newspapers reported. 
 General Sudoplatov began his rise in the state-security system in the 1930's and attained the rank of lieutenant general in the K.G.B. But in 1953, after Stalin's death, he was arrested along with Lavrenti Beria, the much-feared head of the secret police, and spent 15 years in the gulag. He was not officially "rehabilitated" until 1969.
General Sudoplatov left a remarkable legacy. He was a master of the art of "silent" elimination of enemies of the Soviet state -- silent in the sense of untraceable but not necessarily noiseless. In his memoirs, he recalled killing a luncheon companion with a bomb in 1938.
The general also wrote of organizing a unit to hunt down and kill Leon Trotsky, one of the architects of the Russian Revolution with whom Stalin had grown deeply disenchanted because they disagreed about the future of Communism. Trotsky was killed in a suburb of Mexico City on Aug. 20, 1940.
General Sudoplatov told of those and other deeds in "Special Tasks: The Memoirs of an Unwanted Witness -- a Soviet Spymaster," written with his son, Anatoli, and Jerrold and Leona Schecter. Mr. Schecter is a former Moscow bureau chief for Time magazine.
Published by Little, Brown & Company in 1994, "Special Tasks" caused a sensation because of the general's detailed assertions that the Soviet Union had obtained atomic secrets with the aid of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan Project's laboratory at Los Alamos, N.M., and Niels Bohr, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard, three other physicists with central roles in the development of the atomic bomb.
General Sudoplatov said that Oppenheimer and the other scientists passed the secrets to people they knew to be Soviet agents and that they did so both because they wanted to help the Soviet Union defeat Hitler and because they believed that spreading knowledge of the secrets of making nuclear bombs would promote world peace.
The general's assertions outraged many American scientists, some of whom cited examples of what they said were unambiguous and provable errors of fact. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said after a 1995 investigation that it had found no "credible evidence" to back up the general's claims. The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service agreed, stating that General Sudoplatov's allegations "do not correspond to reality." The Schecters stood by their work, however.
But the events in General Sudoplatov's career about which there is little or no dispute make a fascinating, if sometimes chilling, story.
Born in the town of Melitopol, Ukraine, in 1907, Pavel Anatolievich Sudoplatov joined the Red Army at the age of 12, when it was battling not only the pro-czarist, anti-revolutionary White Army but also Ukrainian nationalist forces.
When he was 14, his Red Army unit was depleted by losses and needed a telephone operator and decoding clerk in its intelligence division, "and that is how my career in the security service began," the general wrote in his memoirs.
As a young agent in 1938, he was summoned by Stalin, who wanted to get rid of Yevhen Konovalets, a Ukrainian nationalist leader with whom Pavel Sudoplatov was well acquainted.
Stalin asked the young agent, "What are the personal tastes of Konovalets?" who was then in exile in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.
"Konovalets is overly fond of chocolate candies," Pavel Sudoplatov replied.
Stalin suggested he think about that. The agent did, and supervised the design of a box of chocolates rigged with a bomb set to go off half an hour after the box was changed from a vertical to a horizontal position. He met the Ukrainian nationalist for lunch, set the chocolates on the table as a gift and said good-bye, stopping long enough to buy a light raincoat and hat and to hear the bomb go off.
General Sudoplatov told of arranging the killing of Trotsky by cultivating Communist sympathizers in Mexico, including some who had fought against Francisco Franco's fascist forces in the Spanish Civil War. "For us, enemies of the state were personal enemies," he wrote.
The general said he personally selected Ramon Mercader, a civil war veteran, to do the killing. Mercader drove a pick-ax into Trotsky's head. The assassin spent two decades in a Mexican prison and was honored in Moscow upon his release.
General Sudoplatov directed Communist underground activities against Nazi Germany in World War II. In his memoir, he speculated that Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who has been credited with rescuing many Hungarian Jews from the Holocaust, may have been killed in a Soviet prison in 1947.
The general's wife, Emma, died in 1988. He is survived by his son, an economist in Moscow.
"Despite my rehabilitation, my medals have not been returned to me," the general complained at the end of his book. "Let no one forget that I, too, have been a victim of political repression."

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Saturday about Pavel A. Sudoplatov, a former Soviet intelligence official, misstated the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in the Manhattan Project to make an atomic bomb. He was the scientific director of the Los Alamos laboratory, where the first atomic bomb was made, not the head of the Manhattan Project.

HEADLINE: High Is Low

BYLINE: By Ann Douglas. 
Ann Douglas teaches United States ethnic studies at Columbia University. She is the author of ''Terrible Honesty: Mongrel Manhattan in the 1920's.

 BODY:
At one moment in ''The Shawshank Redemption,'' the hero, played by Tim Robbins, takes over the sound system of the jail in which he's being held. He puts on a record of Mozart, flooding the prison with a duet from ''The Marriage of Figaro.'' The other inmates freeze as the music hits them, their dulled faces transfigured. We're meant to understand that Robbins's good taste is a sign of his innocence, that by bringing high art to his fellow prisoners, he has allowed them to glimpse the long-forgotten country of their own possible redemption.
 In the opening scene of Martin Scorsese's 1973 masterpiece, ''Mean Streets,'' the camera cuts between a home movie of a baptism and Harvey Keitel lying in bed, a cross around his neck, clearly in some sort of spiritual crisis. On the soundtrack we hear Ronnie Bennett singing 
 ''Be My Baby,'' a hit of 1963. It's a seductive, haunted song, wonderfully performed -- a wish already clothed in the sound of loss. It's also a palpable expression of how this character's mind and heart work, an instrument of his being. 
 Both movies aim to be wrenching, but only ''Mean Streets'' succeeds. Though the music in ''The Shawshank Redemption'' is gorgeous, it's part of an uneasy, bogus moment, one dependent on the assumption that so-called ordinary people are starved for high culture, that only ''great'' art can awaken longing for a better life.
 Perhaps inevitably, the United States -- the closest thing to a parent that mass art possesses -- has harbored some of popular culture's fiercest detractors, many of whom in the post-World War II decades persistently linked it with fascism. Today, however, the conflict between elite self-expression and pop fare looks increasingly like a put-up job by critics short of attention. One hundred years from now, such high-low distinctions will be virtually forgotten: what is great art, whether Michelangelo's frescoes for the Sistine Chapel or Cole Porter's song ''Night and Day,'' but art whose excitement time can sometimes sanitize but never destroy, art that has kept its sex appeal? In 2096, Wole Soyinka's memoir of his early life in Nigeria, ''Ake: The Years of Childhood,'' for example, and Michael Herr's dazzlingly dark account of Vietnam, ''Dispatches,'' will find readers among the fans of Stephen King's ''Shining'' and ''Misery,'' while Martin Scorsese's films of urban life and Lee Tamahori's shattering portrait of Maori life in Auckland, New Zealand, ''Once Were Warriors,'' will share Web space with the works of Carl Dreyer and Cezanne.
 Although a new distance has indeed opened up between the realms of high and low art in the last century, it has been less the result of growing mass indifference to the finer things of life than of the creation, for the first time in history, of small but affluent elites capable of sustaining art that never found, or no longer attracts, a mass audience. More ''high'' art, not less, stays in circulation today, and it does so precisely because of the technology responsible for mass culture.
 In any case, the vast majority of artists we revere today were wildly successful in their own time. True, Melville and Dickinson had to wait half a century for their audiences, but Sophocles, Shakespeare, Handel, Dickens, Balzac, Verdi, Stowe and Twain were among the most popular artists of their day. Some American fare once deemed pop, like the music of Louis Armstrong and Irving Berlin, has already achieved canonical, even classic, status, proving itself capable of quickening our deepest appetites for pleasure and rigor.
 For almost a century now, mass art has been among the United States' most reliable exports, and while high art has usually been Europeanbased and white, American pop art's makers have been ethnically and racially varied. People always ask of art a glimpse of their own faces in the mirror, but who has the power to command pro-tracted mirror time has been shifting for most of this century. W. E. B. Du Bois's famous declaration in 1903 that ''the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line'' has already been borne out by the recent history of civil rights and immigration. By 2015 much of the world's population will be gathered in megalopolises like Bombay, Lagos, Shanghai, Jakarta and Mexico City. By 2050, 50 percent of the population of the United States will be ''minority groups'' -- a phrase that increasingly smacks of wishful thinking.
 The high-low division in the English language -- between the version spoken by the privileged Anglo-American elite and that spoken by the lower classes and by immigrant or colonial outsiders -- isn't holding up any better than it is anywhere else. The most striking thing about the literature in English of the last half century is the appearance of successful nonwhite writers, including Toni Morrison, Louise Erdrich, the Nuyorican Cafe poets and the ghetto rappers, and, abroad, non-English writers writing in English like George Lamming, Chinua Achebe and Salman Rushdie, all from former British colonies. The version of English that inspires many of them is not classic British English but its far more recent branch, American English, less for its actual linguistic habits than for the example it sets. The process of reinvention by which Americans, particularly black Americans, have created their own form of English has direct relevance for new English speakers elsewhere.
 As a participant in the Bandung Conference of 1955, a historic meeting of representatives from 29 Asian and African nations, Richard Wright was exhilarated to discover that English was the language of choice and foresaw a fresh chapter in its ''long and glorious history.'' Wright believed that older English speakers suffered from ''a genius for calling things by the wrong names,'' an inability to recognize ''actions initiated by someone else.'' So what Westerners called ''adventure'' and the spread, or defense, of ''civilization'' was also, from the perspective of those they conquered or controlled, slavery and exploitation. In Wright's view, only the once-colonized newcomers to English in the United States and elsewhere possessed the antidote to this malady; they alone could close the gap between the language's promise and its performance by opening its bold declarations of human rights to those the original speakers always tacitly excluded, those they subjugated and colonized.
 Wright's notion of a language disorder finds fresh evidence in contemporary modes of self-definition. While officially abandoning much of the self-glorifying language Wright found so suspect, we have not yet found alternative terms to describe who or where we are.
 What happened to that bold Logos of an era, the ''generation''? After the glamour of the ''Lost Generation'' of the 1920's and the hip cachet of the ''Beats'' of the 1950's, we descended to the ''Baby Boomers'' of the 1960's and 1970's. So far no one has come up with a better term for today's youth than ''Generation X.'' When we do define ourselves and our era, it is a bewildering matter of identity by prefix, an affair of ''posts'' and ''neos,'' as in ''post-industrial,'' ''post-modern,'' ''post-colonial,'' ''post-Marxist'' and ''post-Freudian,'' or ''neo-Marxist,'' ''neo-Freudian,'' ''neocolonial,'' ''neoconservative'' and ''neoliberal.'' The prefix craze has affinities with Hollywood's penchant for sequels and spinoffs. The past is clearer, and more bankable, than the present. We're the folks who come after the moderns, the colonialists, the Marxists and the Freudians. Something happened between the time of the ''modern'' T. S. Eliot and that of the ''post-modern'' Thomas Pynchon, but we can't seem to bring ourselves to say what precisely has changed, who exactly we now are. Why this hesitation?
 It's hard for people to understand, much less title, a show in which they have only a bit part, especially if they are accustomed to playing the lead. They don't see the new leads as stars, but as usurpers, and quite likely inadequate to the task. For the traditionally elite group of white Euro-Americans, the ''post'' syndrome is a way of keeping the cultural spotlight beamed on those they come after -- those stunningly iconic, apparently invincible, earlier members of their own group -- while keeping in obscurity those who now threaten to succeed, redefine and in the process displace them. 
 Non-Hispanic whites still control the crucial powers of naming and defining in our society, and the definitions they put forth, while implicitly claiming universal applicability, in fact cover whites only. The black generation of the 1920's was not ''lost,'' nor did African-American artists of the 1950's see themselves as ''Beat.'' What relevance, if any, does the term ''Baby Boomer'' have for African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans or Native Americans? Predictably, intellectuals have titled today's show after their own absence. ''Post'' sounds self-deprecating, but sometimes it means nothing more than ''post me,'' ''post us,'' a kind of apres moi le deluge mentality, a civilized shirking before the coming menace of unnameable formlessness.
 In fact, what comes ''post us'' is not formless or unnameable, but new and charged, like the face of a stranger startling us from daydreams in a crowded space. Nor does the ''post us'' really exclude us. Shakespeare, Mozart and Melville are safe, safer perhaps than they might wish to be, even as George Wolfe's peerless black tap extravaganza, ''Bring In Da Noise, Bring In Da Funk,'' already preserved on video at Lincoln Center, and Audre Lorde's brilliant memoir, ''Zami: A New Spelling of My Name,'' join them in our esteem. Although white Euro-Americans can no longer monopolize the naming process, they, too, are ethnics; whatever groups hold global and national power in the future, their world will still in part depend on the astonishing achievements of their white Western predecessors.
 On medieval maps, the Americas were labeled ''Terra Incognita.'' In the half millennium since, they have been the place where people of all races and nationalities have collided, thrown upon the kindness or cruelty of strangers. Isn't it time that we got to know ourselves? It's not about ''posts'' and ''neos'' or low versus high. It's about the Race Era, about global economic policies that bring feast to a few and famine to many, about new forms of language and electronic communication. On line accommodates work by geniuses and hacks alike. Anyone can be an author now, and it looks increasingly as if everyone will be. ''People are always seeking self-expression,'' wrote C. L. R. James, the Trinidadian-born historian and critic, ''and where they find it, they stay.''

 Its only message -- cats are lovable -- is similarly generic and universal, and pace T. S. Eliot, comes through even if you can't make out the words. Whatever else progress brings in the millennium, it is unlikely to rescue unborn generations from the musical flypaper that is ''Memory.''

Glengarry Glen Ross, David Mamet, 1984
It seems possible that by 2096 people will think in the sound bytes of computerese, and the formerly live theater will be devoted to electronic, visceral, virtually real spectacles staged in gigantic amphitheaters. Standing apart from this scene and hectoring heroically, a small but influential group of fanatics will be keeping alive America's late-20th-century Theater of Language as represented by the works of David Mamet. The faithful will crowd tiny halls to watch and be confounded by such stark, mysteriously plain plays as ''American Buffalo,'' ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' and ''The Cryptogram.'' Audiences in 2096 won't easily understand Mr. Mamet, who will seem as demanding and rich as Shakespeare is for us today, and far more remote.

Groundhog Day, directed by Harold Ramis, 1993
A small film that lives off its wits and tells a deeply wonderful story of love. It creates a version of the question I ask here -- of what will endure. Its version is to ask how, surrounded by conventions we do not exactly believe in, we sometimes find it in ourselves to enter into what Emerson thought of as a new day.

Star Wars, directed by George Lucas, 1977
George Lucas's fantasy epic Star Wars'' ushered in the era of the space-age blockbuster, in which movies began seeing themselves as intergalactic pop myths featuring heroes who embodied a computer-perfected man-machine ideal. Its story provided an all-purpose term to label a fearsome enemy (''the evil empire'') and its screenplay came up with a mystical pop prayer (''May the force be with you'') that was at once supernatural and secular. Not simply multicultural, its futuristic vision of life in the universe might better be described as multiglobal. Movies would never again be so earthbound.

Network, directed by Sidney Lumet, 1976
Apart from the unrealistic and sentimental sequence of everyone shouting ''I'm mad as hell,'' etc., the film is a stunningly accurate portrait of a media conglomerate that was considered broadly satirical in 1976 but hardly seems so today. Who, 20 years ago, would ever have imagined half-hour infomercials or round-the-clock murder trials and tabloid talk shows? By 2096, ''Network'' will be viewed as almost quaint in scale, but a historic cinematic marker of the early days of the media-benumbed culture, when the possibility of an alternative still seemed remotely imaginable.

Taxi Driver, directed by Martin Scorsese, 1976
As we approach the millennium and New York City plummets into order and cleanliness, crime-free and cool, we also say goodbye to a sordid and very photogenic era in our city's history. That's why in centuries to come, ''Taxi Driver'' will be the work of art most often examined, not only for its garish, expressionistic version of the Big Apple but for the teeming madness inhabiting its residents. Scorsese, Schrader and De Niro had the guts to reveal the urban male hunger for blondes, hatred of blacks and love of guns. And not incidentally, because that's how these things happen, this film brought together a collection of artists at their peak to create an awkward film that is one of the great works of art of the late 20th century.

White Noise, Don DeLillo, 1985
When ''White Noise'' was published, it read like an apocalyptic satire. Sure, it was a dazzling, virtuosic meditation on death and the terrors of ordinary life, but it was also a darkly comic sendup of a futuristic America, tottering on the brink of extinction. Today the novel's characters -- scholars who specialize in Elvis and cereal boxes, ashram dwellers in Montana, doctors who dispense drugs that promise to alleviate the fear of death -- have grown decidedly more recognizable. Who knows, by 2096 the novel may be read as a grimly naturalistic portrait of millennial America, an America in which people turn to cults and obsessions and conspiracy theories in a desperate effort to lend a sense of order to their lives, an America in which everyone
is mesmerized by the ''sealed-off, timeless, self-contained, self-referring narcotic of television, and ''everything we need that is not food or love is here in the tabloid racks.''

Gravity's Rainbow, Thomas Pynchon, 1973
Just as Homer was vital through the Dark Ages not just for his poetry but because his epics served as encyclopedias of how life had once been lived, instructing benighted readers on how to conduct wedding feasts or equip sailing ships, so ''Gravity's Rainbow'' will be the totem of a sort of cargo cult. Readers of the future, starved and all but cretinized by merchandising and technology and religion and entertainment, figuratively if not literally living in caves, will dissect it for clues, refer to it like an almanac, plan their lives on its basis, imagine they could reconstruct the 20th century from its pages.

The miniskirt. You can't kill it. Designers tried in the 70's, they tried in the 80's and they're trying yet again in the 90's. They'll probably try again in 2006. But it will prevail because women like it.

The logo T-shirt
Whether it was a ''Star Wars'' T-shirt in the 70's, a preppy alligator, the Polo/Ralph Lauren shirt of the 80's or the Adidas and Nike hip-hop symbology of the 90's, the logo T-shirt represents what fashion historians fear most: the liberalization of fashion. No effort need be made to decode the messages here, because the wearers are willing to (literally, in some cases) wear their identities on their sleeves. Before the heat transfer T-shirt that exploded in the 70's, there was nothing remotely similar in fashion to this desire to be read like a bumper sticker by strangers. After all, what decade but the 70's could bring us such sentiments as ''I'm With Stupid''? What decade but the acquisitive 80's could lead to ''My Grandparents Went to Hawaii but All I Got Was This Lousy T-shirt''? The messages of the heat transfer T-shirt, and the logo T-shirt that followed, made one of the most important movements of the 90's possible. That was the growth of the Gap, which with its plain white pocket T-shirt sent a message just by lacking a distinctive message. Deliberately not telegraphing a message was briefly believed to be the most individualistic dress of all. Until, of course, everyone was wearing white pocket T-shirts.

Destroyed dresses,
Rei Kawakubo, 1983
The punk propensity for safety pins, the torn clothing that Rei Kawakubo presented at Comme des Garcons, the conscientiously torn-apart tattered garments of Martin Margiela and Xuly-Bet all represent a break with the longstanding tradition of dressing a woman to make her look attractive. Beauty as an ideal to which women universally aspire was being deposed, and in its place there arose an alternative notion: of fashion as a form of pure expression -- capable of conveying anger, protest, the mood of a particular moment -- and freed from its former obligations. Such was the climate in which these statements were made that they were seen as weirdly attractive, and at times more powerful than the assiduous everyday efforts of women intent on ingratiating themselves to the world.

He has found a way literally to package art for the masses, and though his wrapped monuments and fabric fences are already gone, their afterimage will exist in the postcards, films, documents, drawings and other memorabilia that were integral to his Rube Goldberg schemes. Posterity will remember him for mixing marketing smarts with dollops of politics and populism: a quintessential late-20th-century cocktail.Robert RosenblumProfessor of modernEuropean art,Institute of Fine Arts, New York UniversityThe Singing Sculpture, Gilbert & George, 1971Gallery visitors saw a poignant, magical image of two artists forever linked to each other and to their art as they simulated with robotic precision, hour after hour, day after day, a music-hall performance to the heartbreaking sounds of that old British song about the homeless of another era, ''Underneath the Arches.'' Visitors also saw a quantum leap in the tonic shuffle of painting, sculpture and the artists' corporeal presence, a mix that opened endless vistas for younger generations.Robert StorrCurator, Museumof Modern Art,New YorkOne Hundred Live and Die, Bruce Nauman,1984The piece consists of 100 phrases in neon that refer to our ordinary desires, needs, appetites, fears and bodily functions. On the left side, 50 nouns or verbs are paired with the word ''live''
on the right side, the same 50 are coupled with the word ''die.'' Read one way the phrases register as simple statements -- these are just the things we do. Read another way the phrases sound imperative -- these things we can't help but do. Whether habit or confusion, they define human nature at its most basic, suspended between life and death.Arthur DantoArt critic, The Nation Robert Irwin, 1992The California artist Robert Irwin would almost certainly qualify as a great artist. The Pace Gallery in SoHo was given over in its entirety to a work called in 1992. The work consisted of three scrims, floor to ceiling and wall to wall, illuminated by violet, green and orange fluorescent lights at the ceiling, creating uniformly illuminated spaces in just those colors. People who moved through those spaces were perceived as silhouettes and disembodied voices through the scrims. It was uncannily beautiful and transformative.George SteinerFellow of ChurchillCollege, Cambridge University, EnglandA photograph of one of Tinguely's ''self-destructs'' burning to the ground. The haughty, elegant construct tumbles to ash. It was an ephemeral happening. It mocked time and the millennial Western esthetic of survival for art and artist. The photograph, itself a ''negative'' and shadow, is its only witness. Each of these gravely playful motifs will, come 2096, seem wholly prophetic. The smile endures, not the cat.MUSICAllan KozinnMusic critic,The New York TimesEinstein on the Beach, Philip Glass, 1976Glass's music thoroughly reflects the energy, malaise, iconoclasm and quirky humor of our times. Look at ''Einstein on the Beach.'' Ostensibly an opera, it replaces the orchestra with an electronic, keyboard-based quasi-rock band, gives rhythm primacy over melody and abandons plot in favor of either weirdly connected or entirely disconnected imagery. What could be more late 20th century?Peter WatrousMusic critic,The New York TimesCiti Movement Wynton Marsalis, 1993He is the man who oversaw jazz's re-emergence as a mainstream form during the 1980's, helped design the largest institutional jazz program in the country and made his gleaming virtuosity as a trumpeter an adjunct to his grand compositional sensibility. He has made jazz worth arguing about. He has guaranteed its vitality and given generations of young jazz musicians a goal.Jon ParelesChief pop critic,The New York TimesBurnin', Bob Marley and the Wailers, 1973Bob Marley became the voice of third-world pain and resistance, the sufferer in the concrete jungle who would not be denied forever. Outsiders everywhere heard Marley as their own champion
if he could make himself heard, so could they, without compromises. In 2096, when the former third world has overrun and colonized the former superpowers, Marley will be commemorated as a saint.Greil MarcusArt and popular- music criticNever Mind the Bollocks Here's theSex Pistols, 1977This Sex Pistols' album will be around a hundred years from now because the heretical tradition to which it belongs -- a tradition based on the notion of the transcendence of sin, and since the 19th century intertwined with the tradition of the avant-garde -- is so old one can fairly bet it, too, will be around. It's a tradition that guards its talismans like rocs' eggs.PERFORMING ARTSBen BrantleyChief drama critic,The New York TimesJoe Turner's Come and Gone, August Wilson, 1986A good ear for dramatic dialogue isn't a recording device. As much as anything else, it's the ability to turn vernacular speech into poetry that makes a playwright endure. This is the great gift of August Wilson, who has chronicled the black experience in America through a series of plays of both substance and lyricism. They can err on the side of overstatement, but greatness and perfection seldom go hand in hand.Frank RichOp-Ed columnist,The New York TimesCats, Andrew Lloyd Webber, 1981This musical's ad slogan, ''Now and forever,'' is not a gag, after all. If Puccini has survived for a century, why shouldn't Andrew Lloyd Webber, who dumbed down Puccini for the easy-listening audiences of our own time? Once its Broadway and West End runs end, ''Cats'' will be adopted by every amateur theatrical troupe in the world
 here's a show that requires only junk for a set and can be performed by casts of any size, age, shape, sex, ethnicity or ability.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Air-Crash Pay: Limits Reviewed

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
MUCH of the fine print on the back of an air ticket concerns the Warsaw Convention, a 1929 agreement that governs many aspects of international flights, particularly liability in the event of a fatal accident.
In 1966, the top liability limit was set at $75,000, but with time and inflation, the figure has become unrealistically low. Efforts to raise it by amending the Warsaw Convention have failed in Congress, which could not agree to ratify changes. 
 But award limits may be removed by another means, as early as Nov. 1, if the Department of Transportation approves plans submitted to it by a group of world airlines.
As it exists now, the $75,000 limit does not apply if the airline can be proved grossly negligent, a provision that is the source of tortuous trials. Some relatives of passengers lost in the downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 when it strayed into Russian air space and was shot down in 1983 still have cases in court. Others received $75,000. This history means the limit is acutely in mind as the investigation of the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 on July 17 goes forward.
If effective Nov. 1, the new policy would not be retroactive, meaning that the T.W.A. liability limit would remain at $75,000 a passenger. But experts say T.W.A. might find it easier to waive that limit than to explain how three months could make such a difference in the bereaved families' financial well-being. John M. McDonald, a spokesman for T.W.A., said that the line could not comment on this possibility so long as the cause of the crash remained under investigation.
Virtually all relatives of air-crash victims file lawsuits, according to Gerard R. Lear of Speiser, Krause, Madole & Lear in Washington and Lee S. Kreindler of Kreindler & Kreindler in New York, two lawyers expert in the area. Sometimes, Mr. Lear said, the airline's insurance company will offer a settlement of $75,000 or more even before a legal filing, but Mr. Lear said that a plaintiff still needed a lawsuit to guard against expiration of the two-year statute of limitations after which no suit can be filed.
As many as 30 percent of the cases actually go to trial to prove damages, usually based on income lost to the families, if airline offers are considered too low.
 
 
 
A Move Toward Change
 With efforts to amend the Warsaw Convention foundering, about two years ago, most of the world's airlines took steps toward ending the ceiling and letting passengers' families collect any damages they could prove they were entitled to in court, which can be as high as several million dollars. The awards might come through court trials, or through settlements as trials approached, but in either case, this would avert protracted proceedings over gross negligence, technically called "willful misconduct." The Department of Transportation, in deploring such lengthy trials, said that they created "particular hardship for those most in need of prompt compensatory awards."
Mr. Kreindler said that the airlines began to see that such protracted disputes were damaging their reputations and creating ill will. The long suits are also costly to the airlines in dollars. Indeed, Hans Ephraimson-Abt of Ridgewood, N.J., whose daughter died in the downing of K.A.L. 007, said he believed that the Korean airline's legal costs now exceeded the amount it would have paid in settlements of all sorts. Mr. Ephraimson-Abt, who has not yet received any money in the case, which is still pending in New York, frequently acts as a spokesman for victims' families.
Discussions have been held by the airlines, the aerospace industry, the Government, the American Trial Lawyers Association, the airlines' underwriters and the families of victims, with the United States Department of Transportation granting the airlines exemption from antitrust prosecution for the purpose.
Late last year, the airlines agreed upon the goal of removing limits at a meeting of the International Air Transport Association in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. At the end of July, the statements prepared by this organization were submitted to the Department of Transportation for approval. At this writing, 56 world airlines have signed the declaration of intention.
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said the agreements would be reviewed carefully to be sure they met the goal of "reforming a system that has taken far too long to fix."
 
 
 
Removing the Ceiling
 The nub of the agreements removes all ceilings from awards made by courts, or settlements approved by courts, on the basis of damages proved by the plaintiffs: loss of a wage earner's support, for example. A ceiling of $146,000 is established in cases where the airline demonstrates that it is wholly blameless.
Four organizations have commented on the plan. The Aerospace Industries Association, which opposed Congressional amendment of the Warsaw Convention, supports this, as does the International Chamber of Commerce. The Association of Trial Lawyers of America would prefer that the United States withdraw from the Warsaw Convention, but supports approval of the plan as a step forward. The Victims Families' Associations considers the new proposals inadequate. It finds the $146,000 ceiling too low, and most of all, it wants American citizens and residents always to be able to take their cases against foreign airlines to American courts, and this is not embodied in the new proposals.
The Warsaw Convention lists four jurisdictions where airlines may be sued: the domicile or the main place of business of the carrier -- usually the same -- the place where the ticket was sold, or the destination of the trip. Since most international tickets are for round trips, the families association says, the destination of the trip is likely to be the place where the ticket was bought.
American companies can always be sued in American courts, the families association points out, but this is not true of foreign carriers, which resist responding in American courts, and do not need to under the Warsaw Convention if the ticket was bought in another country for a round trip to a foreign city. The trial lawyers' wish to abandon the Warsaw Convention arises from their eagerness for a new "fifth jurisdiction," the residence of the passenger.
Mr. Ephraimson-Abt outlines several situations where an American family could not sue in the United States. In one, a college student studying in Europe is seized with homesickness at Christmas and buys a round-trip ticket on a foreign airline to fly home for the holidays and is killed en route. The Warsaw Convention would not require this case to go to an American court.
A spokesman for the Department of Transportation would not comment on whether it was going to approve the agreement or what it would do about airlines that do not accept it. In the past airlines that have not signed international airline agreements have been told that they may not land in the United States, or that if they do land, they will be treated as if they had signed the agreements anyway.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
Rolling Through Amish Country

BYLINE: By SARAH FERRELL; SARAH FERRELL is the associate editor of The Sophisticated Traveler, a part 2 of The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
WHAT better way to end the summer than with a little trip to someplace green and bountiful? Rural Pennsylvania, around and beyond the city of Lancaster, sounded good to my husband, Tom, and me. In high season, though, it was going to be difficult to do on the cheap: we were too late to book an inexpensive farm stay (and I'm not sure I'd be crazy about a place that invited me to help with the chores) and the less expensive motels were mostly on U.S. 30, a garish strip of factory outlets and fast-food restaurants that we had been warned to avoid at all cost. In near desperation I called a discount hotel broker, Accommodations Express, of Atlantic City, which lists the Pennsylvania Dutch country among its specialties.
After lengthy consultation, the helpful young woman at Accommodations Express suggested the Historic Strasburg Inn, a few miles east of Lancaster. The price she quoted, $90 a night for three midweek nights, seemed stiff, but was well in line with the rates for standard motels and inns in the area. Since the place sounded good, we decided to economize in other ways. 
 Our major economy was bypassing name car rental companies in favor of Better Buggy of Brooklyn. For $49.95 a day, with 100 free daily miles, we were issued a dented Mitsubishi with more than 80,000 miles on the odometer. In any parking lot, it would be the last car to be stolen.
The Historic Strasburg Inn turns out to be charming, a series of one- and two-story brick or wood buildings containing 101 rooms, set among cornfields on 58 acres. As we get out of the car, the silence is broken by the cooing of mourning doves and a far-off train whistle. Our room, No. 107, has a king-sized bed, reproduction Colonial furniture and hand-crocheted runners on the dresser and bedside tables; the small bathroom has a combination tub and shower. It is cozy, at the price we are paying; it would be cramped at the $145 rate posted on the door.
We check out the recreational facilities, among them a horseshoe pitch, free bicycles (one a tandem) and a meadow just right for playing with the Frisbee that we have brought with us, then inspect the dining possibilities. The a la carte listings at the inn's Washington House Restaurant are fairly steep, but the adjoining By George Tavern has a reasonably priced menu of "lite fare." At the small bar, we order a couple of Yuengling's Black and Tan beers (a fragrant brew made in Pottsville, Pa., $2.50 on draft) and chat with some enthusiastic Australians who are completing a long tour of Canada and the United States. Above our dinner table, next to the door, hangs a portrait and autograph of King George I, one of 11 such pictures and documents that give the tavern its name. We both order the lump crabcake, which is large and delicious and, at $11.95, one of the most expensive options. We have a glass of wine apiece, and the bill, which comes to about $33, persuades us that we can afford to dine here regularly.
After the generous "Continental-plus" breakfast of cereals, breads, fruit and juices that is included in the price of the room, we set off on a drive on the back roads of the Amish country, passing fields of corn and tobacco. Immaculately white barns and silos rise above a morning mist, and we pass a one-room Amish school letting out for recess. We slow down for smart gray buggies, drawn by shiny, high-stepping horses, and are able to identify Amish farmhouses by their green roller blinds, the only window covering, we have read, permitted by stricter orders. Every so often we pass a farm stand, apparently run on the honor system, since there is no one in attendance.
Our destination is the town of Intercourse and the People's Place, a complex aligned with, but not owned or sponsored by, the Mennonite Church. The $3.50 audio-visual presentation is called "Who Are the Amish?" The short answer is that they are an Anabaptist group, stricter in observance than their Mennonite and Brethren cousins, who emigrated from Switzerland at the end of the 17th century in the face of religious persecution. They are thriving; their population in Lancaster County has doubled in the last two decades, to about 18,000, and there is now such a shortage of farms that young men have had to turn to other ways of making a living, especially woodworking (yielding an abundance of roadside displays of whirligigs and gazebos).
The People's Place Quilt Museum is across the street, upstairs from the Old Country Store. A $4 fee admits us to an exhibit of 24 late-19th- and early 20th-century Mennonite quilts, family pieces, with documentation about their makers and recipients. All of them are stunners, as are the several fashionable high Victorian wedding dresses on display -- young women did not usually join the church and take on plain ways until after they were married. One of my favorite quilts, a Tulip Rooster pattern (so called because the principal motif can be read as either), is also the most poignant, since it was made by a dying young mother as a keepsake for her daughter. Downstairs, in the back of the store, plainly dressed women are shopping for quilt fabrics.
I have a specific mission in Kitchen Kettle Village, a complex of food and craft shops. My grandmother, who grew up in this part of the world, used to make pickled watermelon rind, and I am in search of some. The Jam and Relish Kitchen, which makes more than 60 sweets and condiments, seems like a good bet. A savory scent comes from the actual kitchen, where young Amish women are cooking up a batch of barbecue sauce. There are old-fashioned staples like rhubarb jam, and such newer ones as jalapeno jelly. Watermelon pickle is $4.99 for 19 ounces. The young woman who rings up my purchase wears a prayer cap and a simple, solid-colored dress, closed with straight pins -- buttons and hooks-and-eyes are too fancy for the Amish.
Time for a late lunch. We have heard that Stoltzfus Farm Restaurant, just down the road, is particularly authentic and, at $12.95 a person, well within budget. There is no menu -- you just sit down at the table and, before you've finished reading the grace printed on the paper place mats, they start bringing you food, all of it homemade and in unlimited quantities: whole wheat bread and tender white potato bread, applesauce, apple butter, pepper cabbage (somewhere between cole slaw and sauerkraut), a terrific chow-chow, sausage, crisp fried chicken and smoky ham loaf, with buttered noodles, string beans, corn and candied sweet potatoes. This is the food that Tom and I both grew up on and have avoided for years. Silly us -- it is delicious. We limit ourselves to one dessert apiece, shoo-fly pie. Without ice cream.
WE finish our touring day at the Strasburg Railroad, one of several attractions that make the town a mecca for anyone who has even the slightest interest in trains. There, we board a bright yellow open observation car for the 45-minute, nine-mile round trip to the junction at Paradise. Our tickets are $8.50 each, $1 more than for the standard coach, and it is worth it for the cool breeze and the views of pristine farmland. We are drawn by engine No. 90, a behemoth of a former freight locomotive that chuffs and steams most satisfactorily. Three little Amish boys wave to us, and every so often, a cloud of white fritillaries takes to the air beside the track. Back at the depot, we spend another 50 cents to visit the Paradise, a private car built in 1916 and fitted out with wood marquetry, that was used by Harry S. Truman in his 1948 whistle stop campaign.
The following day brings more trains, at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania. The $6 fee admits us to the enormous Hall of Rolling Stock, with some 50 pieces of equipment that range from the sort-of-cute (a replica of the early steam locomotive John Bull) to the downright awe-inspiring (the 220-ton Berkshire from 1943). We are in time for a free tour of the outside yard, where about 35 other engines and cars are in various stages of restoration, at the end of which we are astonished to discover that we have been here for three hours.
Moving from the large and serious to the small and frivolous, we drive on to Choo Choo Barn and Traintown, U.S.A., which is a 1,700-square-foot display of miniature trains and trams and cars and ski lifts and Heaven only knows what all, that run through a miniature Lancaster County. There are 17 trains, and many dioramas, some of them animated, with parades, a baseball game, a Boy Scout camp, a circus and an Amish barn-raising, to name just a few. There is also a car crash, a fire and a funeral (non-animated). It costs $4, but you get a lot to look at.
We lunch at Isaac's Deli, part of a Pennsylvania chain with a neon-and-flamingo Miami decor. Since this is Traintown, however, this particular Isaac's also has a room done up as a dining car. Most of the sandwiches are, for some reason, named for birds. Tom orders a hoopoe -- tuna, cheese, bacon and tomato -- while I settle for a sampler of salads. With many refills of iced tea, the bill comes to $14.
Then it's off to Lititz, an old Moravian town about a half-hour's drive away. Lititz is home to the Julius Sturgis Pretzel House, perhaps the oldest pretzel factory in the nation. The tour costs $1.50, and we are each handed a large pretzel as our ticket of admission. At the beginning of our visit, our guide gives us hunks of dough and instructs us in pretzel-twisting. We slowly produce reasonable looking specimens. Then, after a tour of the hellishly hot hard pretzel bakery, we watch a professional pretzel twister forming soft pretzels, with what looks like a single motion, faster than the eye can follow. We're glad we made our faltering efforts first.
We follow the scent of chocolate to the Wilbur Chocolate Company's Candy Americana Museum (free), where we watch grandmotherly women hand-dip chocolates and inspect the old molds and implements and, best of all, a whole wall of antique chocolate pots from all over the world. The attached shop is itself something of a museum with, in addition to chocolates, penny candies of all description, including many (licorice pipes!) that I haven't seen since childhood.
At the General Sutter Inn on Main Street, named for the California pioneer who died here and is buried in the Moravian cemetery, we pick up a free walking tour map published by the Lititz Historical Society. Brochure in hand, we stroll along Main Street, which is lined with 18th-century stone houses. We make a short stop to see Sutter's grave (we are former Californians), then find that we are back where we started, at the pretzel bakery, largely unchanged since 1784.
Back in Strasburg, the bar is teeming with people from Buffalo, who have come for a couple of days in the Amish country and to attend a performance of a biblical epic called "Noah," with 300 animals, 100 live and 200 animated. We had considered the show, but $31 a ticket was too much -- although it works out to little more than 10 cents an animal. On a farewell stroll around the grounds, we notice the faintly shimmering lights of Route 30 in the far distance.
Confusion awaits us on check-out. We are billed for $99 a night, then $89 after I produce my voucher from Accommodations Express and a few phone calls are made. So how much does this room really cost? The answer is multitiered: $109 on a weeknight, $119 on a weekend and $149 for a holiday weekend. We have profited from Accommodations Express's apparent error and have gotten a bargain after all.
We have one final errand as we head home. We are under strict injunction from a friend to stop in Lebanon, to sample the opera fudge at Wertz Candies. Wertz is a third-generation family operation, and by now no one knows why this confection is so named. It bears no resemblance to fudge; rather it is a cream filling, lightly touched with vanilla, coated with pure chocolate liquor (from Wilbur's, as it happens). The impact of black-bitter and silky-sweet is tremendous, and at $8.50 a pound the candy represents the best buy of our trip. At the Farmer's Market we buy a dollar's worth of Lebanon bologna, which, smoky, peppery and vinegary, is to bologna what opera fudge is to fudge.
Lebanon is a good place to end the trip. With its boarded-up downtown movie theater, it is a needed corrective to where we've been, a way station between Vacationland and real life.
 
The bottom line in Lancaster County
 
Logistics
Our chief expenses were lodging, at $89 a night plus tax, and the rental car, which worked out to $327.80 for four days and 112 extra miles, at 25 cents a mile. Gas was $18 more. Admissions and tickets were $28 each. Food ranged from about $22 to $30 a person a day; pretzels, fudge and beer added about $25 to the total.

Raising a Voice for the Victims of Crime

BYLINE: By GITTA MORRIS 

 BODY:
THE victims' rights movement in Connecticut is at a critical point in its evolution says Mario T. Gaboury, director of the Center for the Study of Crime Victims' Rights, Remedies and Resources at the University of New Haven where he is also an associate professor criminal justice.
The center was established in 1994 to provide training in victim services administration as well as to work for victims' rights. The center also recently held a conference in North Haven for professionals who help crime victims. 
 Mr. Gaboury explained that the victims' rights movement found its roots in the political and social turmoil of the 1960's. He said the following decade saw an alliance between diverse political and social groups that focused on victims' rights because victims were being left out of the system. Next came a period of rapid enactment of thousands of statutes that had little provision for enforcement.
In his office recently Mr. Gaboury discussed the third phase of the victims' movement, the enactment of a state constitutional amendment that would strengthen the laws and provide enforcement mechanism. Following are excerpts from the conversation.
Q. Who are the proponents for victims' rights?
A. Historically the victims' movement has been nonpartisan or bipartisan and brought together in its earliest days people from the law and order movements and people who had very liberal views from the women's movement and civil rights movement. The first Federal victims' rights statute, the Federal Witness Protection Act of 1982, was co-sponsored by Strom Thurmond and Ted Kennedy. You now have Bill Clinton and Bob Dole both supporting a Federal Constitutional amendment for victims. The same thing occurred here in Connecticut where both Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives said, this is an issue we can agree upon.
Q. Both the House and Senate of the General Assembly have passed a victims' rights amendment to the state constitution, and it will be a referendum question on the November ballot. Why is it needed?
A. Defendants have a very well developed constitutionally-based set of rights. If the victim tries to assert his or her rights to attend court proceedings and to participate in the system, the defendant says, that would unduly influence the jury and create a prejudicial attitude against me, and my rights are superior because they are constitutionally based. So the problem is one of equity. The only way to put victims on equal footing is to put them into state and Federal constitutions. The constitutional amendment first puts victims on par with defendants. Around 21 states have passed such amendments.
Q. What kind of enforcement will there be?
A. This amendment lays the groundwork to provide an enforcement mechanism so if victims don't get their rights they will have some recourse. We're going to have to decide which agencies monitor what goes on. I advocate the establishment of a victims' ombudsperson's office -- several states have them -- to police the judicial, the prosecutor, the law enforcement, the corrections agencies that are responsible for according victims' rights.
Q. Isn't the language of this amendment still too vague to have real clout?
A. It is exactly the kind of language you find in the constitutional-based defendant's rights: A defendant shall not be subject to unreasonable search and seizure. A warrant shall not be issued except upon probable cause. You establish a principle. How these words come to have meaning is through court decisions that take particular cases or controversies that have facts behind them. It's an evolutionary process. You don't just pass a constitutional amendment and boom, everything is better for victims.
Q. Aside from the need to put the victim on par with the accused, what other considerations are there?
A. The second area is to provide more resources to victims. Victims and victim advocate organizations shouldn't have to be scraping and begging to make their budgets each year. We have millions and millions of dollars focused on the criminal justice system that's entirely meant to accommodate the accused in some way.
We should be putting somewhat equitable resources into victims; for example, enough shelters for domestic violence victims. The economic devastation that occurs when victims of domestic violence leave and the fear they have that they and their children are going to continue to be harassed, are the reasons they don't leave.
So why don't we have programs and resources that are even close to the resources that are put into housing, eating, clothing, medical accommodations, educational opportunities for the convicted in prison?
Q. Why do we need to hear from victims concerning the sentencing of the accused? Do many crime victims ask for leniency for the accused?
A. That's an interesting point. The fact is, many times in domestic situations of violence, even when the prosecutor is not happy with it, the victim prefers not to have the abuser receive the stiffest penalty.
Also, you have homicide survivors who have become ardent death penalty opponents. They didn't want the killing of their loved one to occur, and they now don't want the state in turn to kill.
Q. What about the victims' rights advocates?
A. There are only 10 or 12 victim advocates, who work for the Office of Victim Services within the judicial branch of our state government. We are advocating doubling the number. Almost all states have their victim services programs run primarily out of the executive branch. Only Connecticut has a judicial-based victim advocacy program where victim assistance and victim compensation are actually run out of our judicial branch.
Q. What do they do?
A. We try to counsel and educate the victims, but the decision has to be theirs. No victim advocate should tell the victim what he or she should or should not do.
Q. How many victims' rights agencies or grass-roots groups are there?
A. It depends in some degree on how you define it. The more formal ones that have programs, staff and budgets, like the Connecticut Sexual Assault Crisis Centers, the YW program and the Coalition Against Domestic Violence have a dozen offices around the state. Then you have groups like Mothers Against Drunk Drivers and Homicide Survivors that are less formalized, and are more volunteer efforts. They have thousands of members.
Q. Wouldn't it be more effective to concentrate on prevention of crime?
A. You do have many instances where victims' groups are focusing more on prevention and where victims are trying to work with those who are related to the offenders to bring peace to crime-ridden neighborhoods. In a recent case in another state, a juvenile offender, 14 years old or so, killed a peer. The fathers of the offender and the victim have joined forces to develop a program to bring peace in the neighborhood, and they're working together in both crime prevention and trying to get victim and offender mediation. So I don't think the victims' movement is really as monolithic and single-minded as some believe.
Q. How can you explain that the survivors of crime may win a civil suit against the accused, regardless of whether he's been found guilty or not guilty?
A. The basis for this is the two different outcomes. In the criminal trial you're taking someone's liberty away. In America, the foundation of our system is that we guard the individual liberties, and our system is designed to let guilty people go rather than that one innocent person in jail.
On the civil side, we're talking about taking someone's money away in an attempt to have restitution or some kind of damages, paid. We're much easier taking someone's money away.

HEADLINE: Preserving a Shaker Heritage Where a Prison Now Stands

BYLINE: By ALBERTA EISEMAN 

 BODY:
LITTLE is left of the once-thriving Shaker community in Enfield and what remains is difficult to detect. Some of the plain, dignified 19th-century buildings are enclosed within a state prison; a few that are privately owned stand in the shadow of the giant complex of Lego Systems, the toy manufacturers.
Every so often an incident reminds the public of the communal village that lasted from 1790 to 1914. Two years ago, for example, Lego wanted to widen a road that runs by the last remaining Shaker dwelling house, circa 1850, and more recently, preservationists objected to the removal of century-old window frames from buildings on prison grounds. 
 Most of the time, however, the busy residents of the northernmost section of the state drive past the 22 remaining buildings -- the dwelling house, meeting house, mills, barns, shops, all listed on the national register of historic places -- without a thought of the strong-minded, pious men and women who called themselves the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearance.
Known as Shakers because of the ecstatic dances they performed in the meeting house, they were pledged to hard work, celibacy, common property and physical separation from "the world," their term for non-believers.
They built their communities by hand, with men and women assigned to different tasks and living separately as brothers and sisters in communal dwelling houses. They raised their own food, made their own identical clothing, produced their medicines and developed extensive trades like chair manufacturing and seed production -- a specialty for which the Enfield group was renowned.
The principles that governed Shaker life had their roots in England and were brought to the American Colonies in 1774 by a small group led by Mother Ann Lee, the spiritual leader. In the new world the Shakers founded 26 communities and at their zenith numbered 20,000.
The Enfield settlement, 260 strong and one of the most prosperous, was composed of five "families," the name given to the religious and economic units that ordered Shaker lives. The records list 118 buildings -- "remarkably neat and convenient" wrote John Warner Barber in his 1838 "Connecticut Historical Collections," adding that the inhabitants were "simple and plain in their manners; sober and industrious."
Eventually, the population shrank and the land was sold off gradually. In 1914 the bulk of the remaining 1,650 acres was bought by a tobacco farmer, who in turn sold it to the state for a prison in 1931.
Much has been written about the Correction Department's misuse of the buildings and the dispersion of its now-valued contents -- tales of a meeting house stripped of its trademark cabinets and used as a workshop, of prisoners complaining of the hardness of Shaker beds, of artifacts now worth thousands of dollars burned on a pyre. During the 1930's historic preservation was an idea whose time had not yet come, but things do change.
"They are extremely helpful," said an archeologist, William F. Keegan, of the prison authorities. "They do their best. Their intent is to preserve the Shaker buildings."
Few people know more about the state's one enduring Shaker settlement than Mr. Keegan, whose interest was sparked three years ago while studying at the University of Connecticut with Dr. Nicholas F. Bellantoni, the state archeologist.
"Lego was planning an extension," Dr. Bellantoni recalled, "and the Office of the State Archeologist was called in to conduct test excavations to see if anything pertaining to the Shakers would be disturbed. A dozen students and volunteers assisted in the field work throughout the summer of 1993. What Bill did," he continued, "was to extend the project, with historical research, archival work, mapping, statistics. Over the last three years he has put a lot of time and energy into this project -- he's probably become the main expert on Connecticut's Shakers."
"We think of this as a long-term project," Dr. Bellantoni said. "Certainly it's important enough and there is a fascination on the part of the public about the Shakers. Unfortunately we don't have the funding to keep people on it full-time -- we're much too small a department for that."
The uncertainty doesn't seem to faze Mr. Keegan, who received his bachelor's degree last May and held a variety of jobs before starting his college career.
"Shaker societies are infinitely interesting for things other than furniture," he said, despite the craze for Shaker artifacts.
What intrigues him is the society itself: how it was organized, how it became industrialized, how separate was it from the world since it depended on outside markets for its products.
He admires the Shakers' innovative ways, the irrigation and drainage systems they devised, the medicines they created, their financial prowess, the fact that each village had its own doctor, dentist and infirmary.
"When you join a Shaker society, your life improved far more than that of your neighbors," he explained.
During an interview held in the crowded kitchen of his apartment in Storrs, Mr. Keegan showed a visitor some of the artifacts found during various digs: ceramic fragments, painted in shades of blue and red; nails, bricks, bones, a rusty gear from one of the many mills, a forge fan probably used in making horseshoes. Once the objects are identified, analyzed, catalogued and mapped out, he said, they are stored at the University of Connecticut, forming the second-largest collection of Connecticut artifacts.
"The Shakers gave me a gift," he said of the ongoing commitment that he plans to pursue in graduate school, and whenever he can spare time from other archeological work. Meanwhile, he is completing a preservation plan for prison authorities, so they will not unwittingly destroy important landmarks.
Recently, a new discovery came his way: a six-foot by four-foot hand-drawn map of the entire Shaker village in Enfield during the 1890's, found by a resident who was clearing out his parents' home. It shows a quarry, a garbage dump and "several places where I hadn't thought to look for buildings," Mr. Keegan reported. "Things are always surfacing that tell us more and more about the site."

HEADLINE: The Brave New Face Of Art From The East

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
"CONTEMPORARY ART IN INDIA? THERE IS NO contemporary art in India." So an academic friend tartly reminded me a few years ago. How could an avant-garde art exist anywhere in the "timeless" cultures of what we monolithically call Asia? If it did, it couldn't be any good. Too Western. Or too Asian. Or too little of one or the other.
Her assertion was understandable. But it proved wrong. In New Delhi and Baroda, Calcutta and Madras, new art in nontraditional forms, pitched to an international mainstream market, is being produced as you read these words; art schools are flourishing; a network of art galleries is growing. 
 The same is true across much of Asia. The West has long been alert to the excitements of contemporary Japanese art. But now new art is percolating through China (both the People's Republic and Taiwan) and Korea to the vast archipelago of Indonesia, though little finds its way to the art capitals of Europe and the United States.
As it happens, Asian art of all kinds commands the spotlight in the United States this season. Dallas is offering a one-stop-only autumn show of 17th-century Japanese Momoyama period work. Boston and Brooklyn are giving their Chinese holdings star treatment with new installations. "Splendors of Imperial China: Treasures From the National Palace Museum, Taipei," last season's blockbuster at the Metropolitan Museum, is wending its processional way to San Francisco and Washington. And the extravagantly titled "China: 5,000 Years" bows at the Guggenheim in May.
With such historical riches jostling on the horizon, it would be easy to overlook another phenomenon: the wave of contemporary Asian art -- less than a tidal wave but far more than a ripple -- headed this way, whether in the form of sprawling multimedia installations or traditional images given a distinctly 20th-century spin.
The Guggenheim show will include new work from China. But more immediate news breaks on Friday, when the show titled "Contemporary Art in Asia: Traditions/Tensions" opens in New York at three locations: the Asia Society, the Queens Museum of Art and the Grey Art Gallery of New York University. (The shows remain on view at the first two locations through Jan. 5 and at Grey Gallery through Dec. 23.)
Organized by the Asia Society, the show is the largest gathering of its kind yet seen in the city, though with some 70 works by 28 artists it is still a modest affair and makes no pretense of being comprehensive. It taps just five countries: Indonesia, India, the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand. And it focuses on only one of the many varieties of art produced in each today: politically oriented, with a bias toward installation.
Whatever the show shapes up to be, just by taking place it sets important precedents. It not only ushers in little seen Asian art but lets Asians themselves make the introductions. The curator, Apinan Poshyananda, is an American-trained professor of art in Bangkok. The catalogue is almost entirely by Asian critics and scholars. And the show's ambitious itinerary will take it to Canada and to four stops in Asia itself.
One would like, of course, to attribute its arrival to a flash of esthetic enlightenment on all sides. But money is probably the bottom line. Powerful international trade winds have been blowing from an Easterly direction for some time now (Southeast Asia in particular is booming), and all things Asian are hot property to Western cultural institutions, ever alert to private and corporate financing.
And with its integration into a global market economy, Asia has undergone daunting changes. Vast new wealth, accelerated urbanization, a growing middle class, an unprecedented deluge of Western forms and values have together resulted in an increasingly fragmented and destabilized self-image.
WITH THAT SELF-IMAGE AS ITS theme, "Traditions/Tensions" has dramatic material to work with, though the show arrives in New York with a few built-in liabilities.
One is timing. Art based on "identity" has been a growth industry in the United States for almost a decade. "Diversity" is a concept so overworked and emptied of meaning that Bill Clinton felt comfortable using it in his recent speech accepting his renomination for President. And installation is yesterday's cold potatoes to the mainstream art world.
The fact that installation art is pegged as a Western form also raises difficulties. Generally speaking, to Western viewers, West means modern, non-West means traditional. And while the West seldom has qualms about borrowing extensively from cultures outside its sphere, it is known to get impatient if the exchange goes the other way.
Eclecticism and variety, in other words, are the prerogatives of one kind of art; predictable purity the requirement of the other. Thus, superficially considered, the new Asian art risks being dismissed either as wannabe Western or inauthentically Asian. It may, in fact, not be seen as Asian at all.
Which brings up the flip side of the visibility problem: unfamiliarity. Viewers who come to the show without at least some grounding in the social attitudes, religious beliefs and modern histories of the five distinctive countries embraced here are already seriously behind the curve, for much of this art comes straight from specific cultural experience.
Consider the case of Korea. An ancient culture long dominated by China and colonized by Japan, it was suddenly harnessed to a Western-style capitalist economy half a century ago, with explosive results. The population of Seoul, the Korean capital, jumped from 600,000 to more than 10 million between 1968 and 1988. International corporations like Samsung and Hyundai have become household names, and wealth has contributed an avalanche of new art. (At the beginning of the 1990's it was estimated that Seoul had more than 300 galleries and 60,000 artists.) 
There is no question that prosperity opened doors for Korean artists, giving them first-time contact with the cutting-edge art of Europe and the United States, as well as a potential market. But it also altered the fabric of their daily lives.
Old esthetic traditions were threatened by commercialization. (How can brush-and-ink landscape painting compete with Disney?) Western-style individuality went against the grain of a "we" society. And the idea of innovation as an end in itself left the valued notion of cultural continuity in the dust.
Such ambivalence marks the work of Korean artists in the show. Installations by Cho Duck Hyun offer dramatically lighted archival images -- drawings and photographs -- of an older Korea in what the artist considers a gesture of cultural healing. (He invited a Korean shaman to preside over his 1994 installation for the Sao Paulo Bienal.)
And the overtly political paintings of Kim Ho-Suk, like those in the series titled "The History of Korea's Resistance Against Japanese Colonialism," addressed the country's painful interaction with the outside world. Mr. Kim, whose grandfather was a resistance fighter during the Japanese occupation, depicts 20th-century Korean historical figures but in a delicate 18th-century style.
Some of Korea's historical realities -- colonialism, national partition, economic disparities, the sense of a spiritual life on the rocks and a cultural identity growing ever more fragile in a global environment -- are shared by much of the rest of Asia. A highly conflicted national "self," for example, is the subject of a painting by a Thai artist, Chatchai Puipia, titled "Siamese Smile." Its ferociously grinning male head (a self-portrait, in fact), teeth clenched, eyes bulging, is an unhinged version of a classical Thai Buddha, whose placid demeanor has long been the emblem of a country with an unsettling inner life.
Elements of that life are suggested in an installation by Kamol Phaosavasdi, "Mode of Moral Being," in which a replica of a food vendor's cart common in the streets of Bangkok is fitted out with a video screen showing interviews with call girls, pimps and other denizens of the sex trade. The reference is to the city's international reputation as an Asian center of prostitution for a foreign clientele.
A feminist statement is implicit in this multilayered image of consumption, though other artists deal with the theme of gender more directly. A room-size installation titled "Filipina: DH" by Imelda Cajipe Endaya, for example, with its battered suitcases, black-painted brooms and popular religious prints refers to the exploited labor of Philippine maidservants working abroad.
Another Philippine sculptor, Agnes Arellano, takes a different approach to the status of women in an Asian society. She elevates body casts of women, old and young, onto pedestals to suggest a pantheon of goddesses. Ravinder G. Reddy of India works in a similar vein. He gives a fiberglass sculpture of a woman the dark blue skin of the male god Krishna, and he scales up a gold-painted, confidently smiling woman's head to monumental size.
The recurrent references to religion in "Traditions/ Tensions," though in fact rarely devotional in intention, raise problems in a Western context. Comparable images in mainstream contemporary art in New York tend to inspire condescension or discomfort. In Asian art, if the references are understood at all, they may reinforce the cliche of the East as a font of spiritual wisdom and, by implication, little else.
Yet many artists in the show come from cultures in which religion is a serious matter, both as a refuge and as a burden. (The prevalent choice of installation as a format may be explained in part by the presence of altars as central fixtures of everyday Asian life.)
In the polyglot cultures of Indonesia, for example, animism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and Christianity are, for better and for worse, all active forces. Something of their ambivalent energy comes across in an altarlike installation by Dadang Christanto titled "Kekerasan" ("Violence"), a pyramid of terra-cotta heads, their mouths agape in what could be either communal prayer or a collective howl.
WHATEVER THE ATTITUDE TOWARD religion behind such work -- critical in Mr. Christanto's case, but by no means universally so among Indonesian artists in general -- can the subject itself possibly have any relevance to the highly secularized West? It can and it does, for reasons both negative and positive.
Some of the most divisive ethical and political issues in the United States at present -- abortion, gay marriage -- are being fought along lines of religious ideology. At the same time, the growing Asian immigrant presence in America is having an invigorating, transformative effect on the country's spiritual demographics: the Buddhist, Muslim and Hindu presence in cities is flourishing. Chicago alone has 50 mosques; New York has a huge Hindu population; San Francisco is home to Thai, Korean, Vietnamese, Tibetan, Sri Lankan and Cambodian Buddhist populations.
But if Asia is exporting such cultural riches to us, what is it getting in return? In art, at least, many things, including a fresh range of expressive forms and a new theoretical language. The results can be exasperating (much of the show's catalogue is hopelessly mired in a pretentious Esperanto of Western academic theory-speak that makes even the subtlest work sound overdetermined). But they are just as often exhilarating.
And they offer ideas that non-Asian cultures would do well to consider. The paradigm for a vanguard art in Europe and America is based on a perpetual rupture with the past. Contemporary Asian art, by contrast, is as often as protective of history as it is skeptical. Such conservatism is played down in "Traditions/Tensions." But it is evident in other Asian art forms -- from religious painting to modernist abstraction to traditional work -- unrepresented here.
Could any exhibition encompass such complexity? The answer, of course, is no, though at least some sense of the breadth and vibrancy of contemporary Asian art will be on view in "Traditions/Tensions."
Like any trial balloon, it carries the heavy responsibility of bringing unfamiliar work to a new audience. And Asian contemporary art has not yet had the benefit, in the West at least, of the month-by-month, show-by-show weeding process of its New York counterparts, with the accompanying privilege of making mistakes in public, being forgiven and being invited to try again.
One thing is certain, though: the world is changing fast. Asia is a crucial part of that change. And its new art will be a provocative part of our future.

An Old Romance That Refuses to Rekindle

BYLINE: By Vincent Canby 

 BODY:
Michael Gambon is big not only in size, substance and voice, but also in his singular kind of destabilizing stage presence. There's an element of risk, and therefore of suspense, in everything he does. In this way he well serves David Hare's "Skylight," now at the Royale Theater, where the Irish-born London stage icon is at long last making his Broadway debut. Mr. Gambon and Lia Williams, his co-star, are recreating the roles they originated in London last year in the Royal National Theater production, staged then as now by Richard Eyre, the National's director.
Mr. Gambon has been in movies ("The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover," among others) and played Inspector Maigret in the British television series based on the Georges Simenon novels. Earlier this year I had the opportunity to see him at the National, sharing the stage with Simon Russell Beale and rediscovering the dark, dangerous heart that still beats in Ben Jonson's "Volpone." Yet most Americans know Mr. Gambon best for his great howling performance in Dennis Potter's television classic "The Singing Detective," as a man who slips into fantastical daymares to escape his psoriatic arthritis and the hospital ward that imprisons him. 
 Now "Skylight" gives New Yorkers a chance to appreciate the actor in all of his insidious charm and bulky, middle-aged flesh on the stage, which is where he belongs.
Mr. Gambon's performance illuminates, gives focus to and sometimes appears to ride blithely roughshod over "Skylight," a three-character piece in which the playwright's neo-1960's polemics are never disguised as a love story with complete satisfaction. Like so many of Mr. Hare's works, "Skylight" is about a love that cannot be. This time it's about Tom Sergeant (Mr. Gambon), who exemplifies the England created by Margaret Thatcher, and Kyra Hollis (Ms. Williams), his former mistress, who has the sort of activist conscience once associated with the Labor Party when it was far more vital than it has been in recent decades. A bewildered, well-meaning witness to the events is Tom's 18-year-old son, Edward (Christian Camargo), who may represent a better tomorrow.
After a separation of more than three years, Tom, a successful London restaurateur, turns up at Kyra's chilly, threadbare northwest London flat saying, quite nonchalantly, that it's time they saw each other again. It's a snowy winter evening, and if Tom and Kyra have a lot to catch up on, they have even more to thrash out. Since Kyra abandoned him (he says) without explanation, his wife, Alice, has died of cancer and his chain of restaurants, reaching from London to America and the Far East, has gone public. He's exhausted with all of the concomitant bother of dealing with management consultants and shareholders and a son he doesn't understand. He's also lonely, or, as he puts it, "I need a woman to worship."
Though it's clear that the thirtyish Kyra has missed him, she no longer misses the life of limousines and other perks she enjoyed when she worked for the free-spending Tom. She's now finding fulfillment as a teacher in one of the rougher areas of London's depressed East End. As the evening turns into night, it's revealed that Kyra virtually lived with Tom and Alice, who had become her best friend, as a member of a menage a trois Alice was unaware of. Kyra didn't hesitate to make love to Tom as long as Alice didn't know. She left him only when, not quite accidentally, he allowed his wife to learn the truth.
Kyra accuses him of betraying her trust in him, without saying anything about the trust Alice may have had in her. She remembers those days with Tom and Alice as halcyon. She liked being a part of their secure family. Kyra obviously is a suitable case for treatment. She has some profound problems that the play never adequately addresses, but even with her neuroses she's the same prototypical do-good Hare heroine we've seen in "Plenty," "The Secret Rapture," "Racing Demon" and "Strapless," the film he wrote and directed. She's romantic, numbingly articulate and as emotionally needy as she is desperate for independence.
In the person of Ms. Williams, Kyra, like Kate Nelligan's Susan Traherne in "Plenty," is also great looking. With her lithe figure and fine bone structure, she can appear chic in a flannel nightdress and baggy cardigan. That's important in "Skylight," which, for all its earnestness in behalf of social activism, is a very upper-class, though liberal, kind of play.
Because the author has a way of dealing with political issues through the opposing mind-sets of characters who aren't themselves in economic need, his plays have a way of seeming abstract without revealing larger truths. There's a touch of condescension in the way Tom and Kyra attack each other. The glib analyses that they trade are self-consciously peppered with four-letter words, as if these will convince us of the honesty of their talk and the passion of their feelings. A lot of their accusations are accurate: Tom really does see the world revolving around him; he's selfish, and he has bought into the new conservatism and its jargon in which business is referred to as "the creation of wealth."
IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT KYRA can more easily commit herself to people than to a single person. Yet as they go at each other, it always sounds like stage talk. There's no sense of the spontaneous, brainy, serious fun displayed by any pair of battling lovers in a George Bernard Shaw play. Tom and Kyra have wit but not much humor. They're mismatched from the start. Though there are occasional funny lines and moments of genuine pathos, Mr. Hare writes with the kind of ponderous sincerity that allows for few surprises.
This is where Mr. Eyre's production and, in particular, his actors take over. Ms. Williams is a delight in a role that might have been played by the young, not yet take-charge Glenda Jackson. She has bite, beauty and life as she tries to convince Mr. Gambon's Tom that as much as she adores sleeping with him, she has no intention of again becoming a woman worshiped. She may not be quite as convincing when she talks about the secret glory of her mission to teach the underprivileged, but that's because of Mr. Hare's flat-footed text.
As Tom's baffled son, Edward, who both rails against his father and tries to help him, Mr. Camargo is skilled and thoroughly convincing. His friskiness sometimes suggests a fellow even younger than 18, but then all three cast members work nonstop to give this play a pulse you can feel.
No one more so than Mr. Gambon. Though you can assume that his performance has long been fixed, and that it doesn't vary from one night to the next, you can never be sure what, exactly, Tom Sergeant will do next. It could be a dainty, quite weird little pirouette of postcoital satisfaction, a sweeping, decoratorlike appraisal of Kyra's ugly flat, or a sudden, tearful breakdown, embarrassing in its intimacy, in the middle of a speech of self-serving bravado. He stands on chairs before sitting in them. Sometimes he seems to tune out entirely. Like Laurence Olivier when in fine fettle, Mr. Gambon keeps you deliciously off guard.
While Tom seduces Kyra, the actor seduces the audience. This is a risky business, something that can lead to chaos and tear a production apart. Yet Mr. Gambon plays beautifully with Ms. Williams as they alternately move from moments of tenderness to scenes in which cutlery is flung in frustration, or books are thrown as weapons intended to wound.
Mr. Gambon's immense control as an actor seeps into the character to such an extent that Tom comes to control the play as well, which is actually more about Kyra than it is about Tom.
Any objections to Mr. Gambon's work in "Skylight" must be academic. As you respond to the dervish performance, you're also aware of the mysterious talent of the actor within it. The effect is not to destroy the performance but to double the pleasure, a phenomenon as rare and spectacular in the theater as the green flash is on the high seas. Mr. Gambon thus transforms a bluntly satiric text into an evening of grand, unapologetic theatrics.

HEADLINE: Explorers Offer the World to the Classroom

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
THE Help Wanted advertisement read "Three explorers to travel from Venice to Hong Kong fall 1996. Must speak Russian, Chinese or Turkish, enjoy working with children and computers. Will travel five months with GlobaLearn team, a New Haven educational nonprofit organization."
The trans-Asia trip will be GlobaLearn's third expedition. As teams of explorers venture out into new cultures they share their adventures with thousands of American schoolchildren through the Internet. Schools throughout Connecticut are on line with the GlobaLearn explorers. 
 GlobaLearn was born in the imagination of Marat A. Armbruster, a 27-year-old New Haven resident. After college he spent five months in the Aleutian Islands working at a salmon cannery. As he journeyed from New Haven through Chicago to Seattle and on to Alaska, two young New Haven friends, ages 6 and 7, pushed pins into a large map of the United States to follow his route. He sent them postcards with geographic questions and they were delighted. "Their mother said they had been eager to go to the library to find out more about the places I had been to. It really got me thinking. They never would have been interested in Alaska without that personal connection."
At the University of Michigan he tutored juvenile offenders, ages 8 to 17, in American history. "I quickly realized that my task was not to teach them the text but to engage them in something, anything, because their attention span was so short. What shocked me was how little sense of geography they had. How could history make any sense to them?" His students could not put Detroit, New York, Washington on the map. He decided to try to reproduce his own educational experiences in a modest way.
After high school he wandered through Asia and Europe for two years. His travels motivated him to work hard and explore such subjects as the history of Buddhism at the University of Michigan. Without the earlier experiences he believes he would not have succeeded at the university. He wondered if he could somehow transmit to his students a similar experience of learning through travel. He designed a Dungeons and Dragons style of game. He asked them to choose places to visit. It was an effective strategy. At the end of the class they were able to exactly trace their routes on a map.
These two experiences combined to inspire the creation of GlobaLearn. "I really felt to be able to bring the world to kids in the way I had had the opportunity to do would be valuable," Mr. Armbruster said. "I decided that would be my mission."
He consulted with a friend he calls The Technologist. He had already conceived the notion of expeditions but transmitting the information back was a hurtle. His friend suggested using satellite to beam it back, with computers for distribution. This was before the creation of the World Wide Web. "Now the Web is the perfect medium of delivery for us," he explained.
In 1995 GlobaLearn ran a pilot expedition they called the G-7 Turkey Expedition. Over 270 children in the United States, Canada and Belgium participated. Mr. Armbruster and Raymond Smart, of Wilton, chairman of the GlobaLearn board, went to Brussels to represent the United States at the European Union's ministerial conference on the information society. Four Globalearn explorers in Turkey transmitted their daily journals and conversations with Turkish children via their World Wide Web site.
Visitors to the conference could stop by and question the Turkish children. A Greek student from an international school paused and was invited to participate. "Why would I talk to them? They are my enemy," he said. He was lured into playing with the computer. By the end of the conference he had made friends with Nunu, a Turkish girl. When he was asked why he would talk to her when she was Turkish, he replied, "I don't care, she's my friend."
At St. Thomas Day School in New Haven students closely followed the expedition. When a bombing incident occurred between Kurds and Turks after the expedition had ended worried students called GlobaLearn to make sure their new friends were okay.
The St. Thomas teacher moved the computer into the math class during that period of unrest to reassure the youngsters. The students were working on challenging word problems. To bring greater clarity to the problems they were changed, and GlobaLearn fuel consumption rates replaced the original wording. Mr. Armbruster snapped his fingers and exclaimed, "Like that, the kids grasped it because it was real life to them."
Mr. Armbruster said that parents and teachers saw immediate results because the children were so eager to go on the expedition, to meet other children and to interact with the explorers. Some teachers reported using GlobaLearn as a reward. When students finished more mundane class tasks they were able to go on line.
The second expedition was an eight-week journey that began in March and went around the Black Sea, through coastal communities in Turkey, Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria. Mr. Armbruster, whose father is Turkish, has many friends and government contacts in Turkey.
This time they had 5,000 fourth, fifth and sixth graders participate during a three-month trek. Six Americans including four explorers, a security/logistics person and a videographer traveled 3,500 miles.
Mr. Armbruster explained that though many tourists have traveled through this region, what set the explorers apart was their goal. "No one had circumnavigated the Black Sea, put together a portrait of this geographical entity and defined it through its children. We used the children to investigate the relationships among industry, the economy, the environment, history and traditions."
One Connecticut site was Beecher Road Elementary School in Woodbridge. Upon their return, Celeste Cordani, a computer teacher at the school, invited the explorers to come to class. The children were excited to meet them and they had a party including food from the Black Sea nations prepared by class mothers. The children asked questions and presented their own reports on the expedition. Questions included, "Did you ever fight with each other? How do you stay occupied when you have nothing to do? How do you get to be an explorer?"
One group of children designed a computer scavenger hunt and asked their classmates, "What is the new name for Constantinople? What is Attaturk?"
Ms. Cordani observed that the project was "a powerful example of how positive Internet involvement can be for kids."
"Some kids really blossomed with this assignment," she said, "kids who had shown no motivation before."
In September GlobaLearn set out for its most ambitious expedition. For six months, 50,000 fourth, fifth and six graders will follow the six-person team on their journey. It will retrace Marco Polo's trade routes through 14 countries and the territory of Hong Kong, 8,000 miles from Italy to Hong Kong.
As with the other expeditions the team will stay with host families and children will be able to communicate with each other. "We are hosted by children 9 to -13. We wake up with them, eat breakfast with them, go to school with them," explained Mr. Armbruster.
Raymond Smart, president of the Smart Family Foundation in Wilton, was impressed with GlobaLearn's grant request. "When I saw their proposal I thought this was a reason to have computers. A computer is merely a delivery system for the software. For the first time here was a software package that was non-biased in its approach, that was comprehensive in its coverage of the curriculum and really easy to use. Most important it looked like something kids could get engaged in."
Getting kids engaged matters a great deal to Mr. Smart. "You can't force kids to learn, which is one of the presumptions that persists." He was taken with the content that GlobaLearn offered. "You have to have material that is seductive. A lot of the stuff I see is not. It covers the curriculum O.K. but the kids are bored out of their minds."
Mr. Smart became so enamored by the GlobaLearn proposal that he agreed to serve on their board and then to become chairman. He accompanied Mr. Armbruster to Brussels to demonstrate GlobaLearn's capacity to link children nation to nation. He now makes it a practice to meet the explorers for an end of expedition party. And he is negotiating to link up the Los Angeles public school system, which would mean the trans-Asia trip could reach more than 300,000 children.
For more information about GlobaLearn their Web site can be visited (http://www.globalearn.org.). GlobaLearn prefers that users register. There is no fee but they are still conducting research and need information from participants.

HEADLINE: County Budgets Feature Tax-Reduction Plans

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
REFLECTING a fair year for the regional economy, the Nassau and Suffolk County Executives are proposing budgets that leave further behind an era of fiscal crisis and express tempered optimism for 1997.
In Suffolk, Robert J. Gaffney's $1.7 billion plan would raise property taxes 3.3 percent, or $21.35 for an average taxpayer. 
 Mr. Gaffney said the county would end the year with a $24 million surplus despite a 0.25 percent reduction in the 8.5 percent sales tax.
In Nassau, Thomas S. Gulotta's $2.2 billion proposal combines a $17 million tax cut with higher spending. Higher sales-tax revenues, an indicator of stronger retail sales, partly explains the contradiction.
Suffolk Democrats complained that Mr. Gaffney, who was elected to a second four-year term in November, sought to raise taxes less out of necessity than to dispense patronage by creating new jobs and hiring consultants.
The minority leader in the County Legislature, Maxine S. Postal, Democrat of Amityville, said the proposed increase would be forgotten in three years, when Mr. Gaffney might seek a third term.
"For the next two years he's home free," said Ms. Postal.
The projected surplus, which would be used to finance the budget, shows a vastly changed picture compared to five years ago, when a record deficit of $99.2 million created a crisis and led to sales-tax increases.
Mr. Gaffney said one troubling sign was an $11 million increase in delinquent tax payments. He asked the County Planning Department to investigate that.
But he said other signs were favorable, adding, "This year we have seen growth in our local economy and an expansion of our economic base and assessed value."
The two counties also escaped major cuts in Federal and state revenues. Most major reductions proposed by Congressional Republicans two years ago were not enacted. In Albany, compromises between Gov. George E. Pataki and Democrats in the Assembly averted other cuts.
Uncertainty remains over costs for social services after Washington made major changes in welfare.
"Everyone thinks it was a great thing," Ms. Postal said. "But it may end up costing Suffolk County more money."
Long Island government officials and economists said they expected stability and slow growth would continue. "The regional economy is clearly improving," said Mr. Gulotta.
He attributed his proposed tax cut to gains in the economy and cuts in county government. County taxes are one-fifth of the total tax bills for Nassau residents.
Mr. Gulotta said county employees declined, from 16,885 in 1977 to 10,180, a 40 percent drop. The proposed budget, he added, would cut an additional 92 positions.
Mr. Gulotta, who is expected to run for re-election, said he had no plans to emulate Mr. Gaffney and proposed to reduce the county sales tax. The 8.5 percent tax is the highest in the state.
"Our emphasis has been to reduce wherever possible the property tax," Mr. Gulotta said. "Our residents pay dollar for dollar on property taxes. The sales tax is subsidized by people who do not live in Nassau County."
According to Mr. Gulotta, nonresidents paid one-third of the sales taxes, or more than $200 million a year.
Thomas Conoscenti, a regional economist who advises governments and businesses, predicted that moderate growth in 1996 would slow slightly. He said he expected retail sales to increase 5.2 percent in final figures for 1996. But the slower economy would mean a 4.1 percent increase in retail sales next year, he predicted.
Mr. Conoscenti predicted that Long Island employment would show an increase of 16,000 jobs this year, a 1.5 percent rise. He said 10,500 jobs would be created in 1997, an increase of 1 percent.
Unemployment of 5.2 percent in Suffolk and 4 percent in Nassau in the first half of this year would decline next year, he added.
Bruce Nyman, the Democratic minority leader in the Nassau Legislature, said the county's economy was in crisis. "We may have bottomed out but I still do not see an upturn," Mr. Nyman said. "Maybe people are shopping more, but I don't see improvements for our small businesses and downtown areas. Anyone who thinks we are not in crisis here on Long Island is a misguided cheerleader or has his head in the sand."
Mr. Nyman said Mr. Gulotta's tax proposal would have little impact, and he questioned how Mr. Gulotta could raise spending and cut taxes simultaneously.
Mr. Gulotta's budget plan will be scrutinized by the budget review office of the new County Legislature. Mr. Gulotta, who had proposed establishing the office, said he welcomed its review. The Legislature also held three budget hearings last week.
The director of the office, Timothy P. Sullivan, said he planned to issue an analysis before Oct. 30, the deadline for adopting a final budget. The earlier date ends years in which the final budget was not voted on until after Election Day.
Mr. Sullivan, former chief fiscal officer of the New York City Council, said he was hired after having responded to an advertisement in The Wall Street Journal. He said he had no ties to Nassau Republicans and Democrats and was not yet even a resident of the county.
Mr. Sullivan's staff of three analysts and a secretary is less than one-fourth of the Suffolk counterpart.
That budget review office has a reputation for independence and for often challenging figures in the Executive's proposed budget. Its analysis has often been the basis for legislators' budget amendments.
The budget deadline in Suffolk is Nov. 7, two days after Election Day.
Last year, in a final vote after Election Day, the Republican majority in the Legislature agreed to extend 0.75 percent in the sales tax that had been scheduled to expire at the end of 1995.
They also transferred a $25 million surplus from a water-protection program to the general fund to avoid what they said would be a deficit caused by lower than budgeted sales-tax receipts.
Mr. Gaffney disagreed but did not veto the move.
The $25 million nearly matched the $24 million surplus that Mr. Gaffney has projected for 1996.

HEADLINE: Berkeley Hopes $120 Million Plant Erases an Image

BYLINE: By JOHN McCLOUD 

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif.

 BODY:
SEEKING to overcome what it concedes is a well-earned reputation for being antidevelopment, this city has a new $120 million multipurpose biotechnology plant to show off as a demonstration that such a reputation is outdated.
Built by Bayer Biotechnology Corporation, a division of the German pharmaceutical giant Bayer Group, the 120,000-square-foot plant was completed this spring, the first major offshoot of an innovative 30-year development agreement the company reached with the city in 1992. Bayer has also built or expanded six other buildings with a total of about 70,000 square feet on its campus. 
 "This agreement was groundbreaking in terms of our political history," said the city's planning director, Gil Kelley. "Berkeley's had a reputation for being slow-growth and antibusiness, but we've known for some time that despite the impression of the rest of the world we have some pretty unusual assets. This was a step in Berkeley's history that announced we are not anti-business. It sent shock waves throughout the Bay Area."
Dennis Cohen, a former Berkeley Chamber of Commerce president who developed a high-technology business incubator project in West Berkeley, said that there was no longer a sense that the city was an adversary to business.
"They've been willing to contribute to business programs and make the kind of public investment that would encourage business development," he said.
As a sign of the new approach, the city opened a one-stop permit center that frees people from having to go to multiple departments to process building applications. Regulations have also been streamlined, Mr. Kelley said.
In addition, the city now actively recruits new businesses, especially those that offer blue-collar jobs and entry-level positions for the approximately 20,000 residents out of a population of 103,000 classified both as low- or moderate-income and not students at the University of California.
"Everyone thinks of us in terms of the university, but we also have a large low-income population," Mr. Kelley noted.
The effort may be working. Federal figures indicate that the city had a 14 percent increase in manufacturing jobs between 1987 and 1992, reversing a 15-year decline. Although some industrial companies have left since 1992, more than two dozen others have apart from Bayer have located or expanded in West Berkeley, the city's traditional industrial zone. They have accounted for about 400,000 square feet and a net increase of about 120 new jobs. Mr. Kelley estimated that industrial companies provide about one quarter of the city's total of 68,860 jobs.
Bayer's agreement with the city gives the company the right to develop up to 1.17 million square feet of new construction and retain up to 163,000 square feet of existing space on a 30-acre site it owns in West Berkeley. The company expects to spend $300 million on capital improvements and add 350 jobs during the first 10 years of the agreement.
While the agreement grants Bayer several exemptions from current zoning regulations, including allowing buildings up to 10 stories rather than the four normally permitted by statutes, its most important feature is the assurance that city requirements and regulations for the site will not change with political winds.
According to Bayer Biotechnology's president, Dr. George Scangos, that assurance was crucial to the company's decision to remain and expand in Berkeley. It looked at options in Connecticut, where Bayer's pharmaceutical division has its headquarters, and North Carolina as well as Germany before making a commitment.
"Berkeley's reputation was a significant concern," Dr. Scangos said. "Any company contemplating a several-hundred-million-dollar capital investment would be wary. The concerns were how to be able to plan rationally for a site we knew would be expanding, in Berkeley, which has a very diverse constituency."
Dr. Scangos said Bayer initially considered closing the plant, which has been in operation since 1903 and which Bayer acquired in 1978. Instead, the company decided to make it the center of its worldwide biotechnology division to take advantage of the San Francisco area's growing importance in the world of biotechnology.
Bayer's concern with the city's reputation as antidevelopment proved somewhat justified. Neighborhood and environmental activists forced the company to participate in more than 100 community meetings and spend more than two years addressing local objections before reaching an accord.
To win approval for its plans, Bayer committed itself to spending $12 million on environmental and community projects, including cleanup of past contamination in an adjacent park, creation of a water reclamation program and donation of $1.4 million to help train disadvantaged high school and junior college students for employment in biotechnology.
Although the demands might appear burdensome, Mr. Kelley reported that Bayer has spent and done more than required. "They've been a wonderful corporate citizen," he said.
Some project opponents also appear to have had a change of heart. Laurie Bright, a West Berkeley resident who owns an auto-repair shop a few blocks from the Bayer site, recalled that he expected the international corporation to try to ride roughshod over nearby residents and businesses. Now he supports the project. "I think that Bayer has been very good about keeping their word on all the community mitigations they said they would provide," Mr. Bright remarked.
To the owners of businesses that recently relocated to Berkeley, the city's level of support has come as a pleasant surprise. "We've actually found them to be very accommodating," said Fred DaMert, president of DaMert Company, a specialty-toy maker that relocated from San Leandro, Calif., to West Berkeley earlier this year. "We haven't experienced any of the nightmares we heard about."
But it is also true that most of the new companies are in businesses that produce little or no undesirable environmental impact. Old-style industries that produce noxious fumes, plumes and effluents have been increasingly replaced by companies less likely to arouse the ire of neighbors. DaMert, for example, designs, assembles, packages and distributes its toys from Berkeley but has them manufactured overseas.
ON the other hand, Mr. DaMert pointed out, he employs more people per square foot than the preceding tenant of his space, a maker of airplane paint.
"I have more than 30 employees in a space that used to employ half a dozen," he said.
Other new companies in West Berkeley include Kali Sportsnatural, a nutritional supplement producer; Powis Parker, a maker of document binding machines, and Used Rubber U.S.A., which recycles used inner tubes into handbags and other personal accessories.
Golden Pacific Brewing Company is building a small commercial brewery and, thanks to the city's help in securing state industrial bonds, Pyramid Brewing Company is building an $8 million, 100,000-square-foot brewery that will employ 70 people.
Mr. Kelley said the biggest task now was to get several vacant industrial sites back into operation. The largest is a 10-acre former Colgate-Palmolive plant that has sat unused for more than a decade.
"It's got a lot of hulking concrete buildings that were built to suit a type of industry that doesn't exist anymore. It's difficult to get developers interested, but we've had a couple of bites recently," he said.
If anyone shows interest, he added, the city will be there to help.
"I don't think we have to kick industry out to the suburbs to have a livable city. I think having a broad job base helps make this a livable city. It's taken time for Berkeley to learn this, but I think we finally have," he said.

HIS HOLINESS
John Paul II and the Hidden History of Our Time.
By Carl Bernstein and Marco Politi.
Illustrated. 582 pp. New York:
Doubleday. $27.50.
In a century of commanding figures, there have been few more fascinating -- and central -- personalities than Pope John Paul II. He became the spiritual leader of the world's 900 million Roman Catholics at the moment when Communism was beginning to crumble from within. His historic 1979 visit to Poland, when millions of Poles rejoiced in the streets at the unlikely triumph of a Polish pontiff, demonstrated for the first time the possibilities of "people power" behind the Iron Curtain and inspired the birth of the Solidarity movement. Today, his unyielding views on abortion and the ordination of women define a view of the church that puts him at odds with many of his flock. 
 In "His Holiness," two veteran reporters, Carl Bernstein and Marco Politi, one based in Washington and the other in Rome, apply the venerable techniques of Washington reporting to unearth the Pope's secret role in bringing about the end of Communism -- what they portentously term "the hidden history of our time." They interview the Pope's aides, some of whom cooperate only on condition that they not be identified. They speak with President Ronald Reagan; Lech Walesa, the former leader of Solidarity; and senior American intelligence officials. In the United States, they use the Freedom of Information Act to get access to formerly secret American diplomatic cables. In Russia, they obtain copies of Politburo minutes that have been kept secret until now. They expose new details about American covert operations to aid Solidarity.
The results are nonetheless not entirely enlightening. Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Politi, who has covered the papacy for 19 years, amass an impressive array of facts about the inner workings of the Vatican, the Pope's early life and dealings between the Pontiff and President Reagan's emissaries. But their principal assertion -- that the Pope and President Reagan combined in a covert alliance to bring about the end of Communism -- is largely unsupported by the evidence in their book. And their view of the Solidarity movement as an extension of the Catholic Church in Poland misses the more complicated and subtle relationship between the two most potent anti-Communist forces in that nation. Hidden history isn't necessarily significant history.
As recounted in "His Holiness," the secret alliance boils down to a series of meetings between the Pope and Vernon Walters, the Reagan Administration's Ambassador at Large, and William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence. Mr. Walters is said to have shown the Pope satellite photos of Soviet troop movements and to have told him, obliquely, about American efforts to keep Solidarity alive, if necessary as an underground movement, after the Polish Communists imposed martial law in December 1981 and arrested many of its key leaders. Classified cables obtained by the authors show that Mr. Walters shared with the Pope such pearls of American intelligence analysis as the 1982 assessment of the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev ("We think he's a little gaga," he is quoted as telling the Pontiff). The authors make vast, implausible claims for the Pope's influence on President Reagan, writing that other Presidents "had waited anxiously at their desks for bombers to return from their missions: Reagan waited for reports from the Pope."
Mr. Bernstein first made the case for a secret alliance between the Pope and President Reagan in a 1992 cover story in Time magazine that was derisively received by senior Solidarity leaders in Poland. The Pope and President Reagan, he wrote then, agreed at a meeting in June 1982 to undertake a "clandestine campaign to hasten the dissolution of the Communist empire." Richard Allen, the Reagan Administration's first national security adviser, was quoted in Time as calling the collaboration "one of the great secret alliances of all time." In the book Mr. Allen is quoted slightly differently, saying it was "one of the greatest secret alliances of all time."
Four years later, in "His Holiness," Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Politi offer a considerably more nuanced explanation of Mr. Allen's words: "Hyperbole aside," they write, "the description contained essential elements of accuracy as both powers pursued their individual goals along parallel tracks: keeping each other informed, always taking each other's sensibilities into account, consulting, searching for common moral and political ground, plugging regularly into each other's enormous intelligence capabilities, but never formally undertaking clandestine activities together." It seems to have been more a confluence of views of two profoundly anti-Communist leaders than an alliance.
There is no doubt that Solidarity flourished as an underground movement, with help from the Central Intelligence Agency, the American labor movement and the Catholic Church, after the imposition of martial law in 1981. But it was by no means a smooth collaboration. Although the Reagan Administration, informed by a well-placed Polish spy, knew in the fall of 1981 of the Polish Government's increasingly serious preparations to impose martial law and arrest the leaders of Solidarity, it did not tip off the anti-Communist movement or warn the Polish Communist leadership against taking such action. (Senior American officials said later they did not want to encourage Solidarity to start a futile uprising; Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski took the American silence as tacit approval of his intentions, particularly because he knew by November that his plans for martial law had been passed to the Americans by the spy within his ranks.)
The declaration of martial law on Dec. 12 indeed caught Solidarity flat-footed, and nearly all of its key leaders were easily rounded up. Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Politi add a potentially significant chapter to this story. They report that just days before martial law was imposed, Mr. Walters traveled to Rome and gave the Pope detailed intelligence suggesting a crackdown was imminent. According to the book, Mr. Walters showed the Pope photographs of Warsaw Pact troops moving toward the Polish border, and of heavy equipment being assembled -- "military vehicles, personnel carriers and tanks, for use by Polish forces." All of this raises a question not addressed by the book: Did the Pope fail to pass the word to Solidarity or church leaders in Poland? Martial law seemed to take the Polish episcopate totally by surprise, and on Dec. 13 Jozef Cardinal Glemp, the Polish primate, urged Poles not to resist. Later, the Pope would issue a much sterner statement, saying that the church stood "in solidarity with the Polish nation."
The covert assistance from the United States enabled Solidarity to publish and distribute a host of anti-Communist periodicals. They stirred up trouble and raised Poles' spirits through some drab, depressing years. In the end, however, the 1988 decision by the Polish leader, General Jaruzelski, to begin the church-sponsored "Round Table" talks with Solidarity and other anti-Communists did not result from the pressures of a secret operation -- either the church's or the C.I.A.'s. The Rube Goldberg device that was Communist economics had finally reached a point of irrevocable crisis. Inflation was spinning wildly out of control. Production was dropping. Food was hardly available. Painful reforms were needed, and only the anti-Communist opposition had the popular standing and legitimacy needed to ask that the people make the requisite sacrifices. General Jaruzelski eventually agreed to allow Solidarity to run candidates in a Parlimentary election. Months later, the Berlin wall was coming down. The Pope, as quoted in "His Holiness," offers a balanced summation of these events and his role, saying: "The tree was already rotten. I just gave it a good shake and the rotten apples fell."
For a book so focused on Poland and Solidarity, "His Holiness" does little to explain the complex relationship between Poles and their church. Under the Communists, every Mass, every religious gesture, every saint's day, was celebrated as a gesture against "Oni" -- "Them." As became emphatically clear after the fall of Communism, these outward signs of devotion did not mean that Poles universally shared the Pope's views on abortion, divorce or sex education. When the church began pushing its social agenda in the early 1990's, particularly a legislated ban on abortion, its standing quickly plummeted. The politicians with which it was most closely identified fared poorly in subsequent elections. Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Politi explain this startling change by writing that "Poland had changed." That is one possibility. But it seems more likely that the assumptions about Poles' religious allegiance were misguided in the first place, and that senior officials at the C.I.A., the Vatican and the Politburo, and perhaps the Pope himself, did not understand the Poles' view of their church as well as they thought they did.

The Schools We Need And Why We Don't Have Them.

Horace's Hope What Works for the American High School.

Has anyone noticed that the culture wars have ended? In 1987, when E. D. Hirsch's "Cultural Literacy" appeared, the book was widely regarded as another right-wing grenade lobbed in the direction of multiculturalists, who were attacking the literary canon and, by extension, all of Western civilization. Mr. Hirsch's book may be best remembered for its appendix, a compendium of some "5,000 essential names, phrases, dates and concepts" that "literate Americans know"; it caused him to be lumped with conservatives like Allan Bloom and Dinesh D'Souza, who bemoaned the "closing of the American mind" and the rise of political correctness on college campuses. 
 Some old-fashioned liberals, among them Arthur Schlesinger Jr., were sympathetic to Mr. Hirsch's arguments. Troubled by multiculturalism's ethnocentric offshoots, they fretted over the "disuniting" of American culture. But most progressive educators accused him of dimwittedly promoting the rote memorization of isolated facts; Theodore R. Sizer, an advocate of project-based learning, is their representative. Left-leaning radicals denounced Mr. Hirsch's list as culturally imperialistic: an attempt to impose Eurocentric values on an increasingly diverse population that had little interest in dead white males or their putatively "great" books.
 But no one talks about dead white males anymore; the phrase sounds like the kind of shorthand found in the personal ads: "DWM seeks SWF to share necrophiliac fantasies, classics and fun." Conservatives no longer seem particularly concerned with what children learn; school "choice" has replaced the culture wars on the conservatives' agenda. Exactly what's meant by "choice" isn't always clear. When Republicans talk about it, they're generally referring to "vouchers," or government stipends that all parents, ideally, could use to send their kids to private or even parochial schools. When Democrats talk about it, they're generally referring to "public school choice" or "charter" programs that allow parents to pick which public school their child will attend instead of being assigned to one by geographic zone.
 Just how dramatically this new debate has altered the political landscape is evident in Daniel McGroarty's "Break These Chains: The Battle for School Choice" (Forum/Prima Publishing, $23.95). At one point Mr. McGroarty, a former speechwriter for President George Bush and an occasional contributor to National Review, praises the "Afrocentric focus" of two private, voucher schools in Milwaukee and notes that its "elevating effect . . . on students constitutes an overwhelmingly positive part of the school culture." A conservative touting the ameliorative effects of ethnocentric curriculums on students' self-esteem? Who'd have thunk it? Such a conclusion would have been inconceivable among Republicans just a decade ago. "For some conservative supporters of school choice," Mr. McGroarty concedes, "the Kwanzaa celebrations will come as a shock." But he notes: "Defenders of choice in theory must have the courage of their convictions to accept choice in practice" -- even if it means packing kids off to ethnocentric schools.
 By the terms of this new debate, Mr. Hirsch is a dyed-in-the-wool liberal. In "The Schools We Need: And Why We Don't Have Them" he argues against vouchers and for a national standardized curriculum. The idea won't win him many friends among liberals or conservatives. Most progressive educators believe that schools should be free to develop their own curriculums without having to worry about pressing students to pass exams. Although conservatives often cite the performance of schools in other countries to demonstrate how poorly our own schools prepare American students, Mr. Hirsch suggests that international comparisons actually argue against vouchers. "The Dutch instituted publicly financed school choice many years ago, and today the Netherlands exhibits the least consistent school quality in northern continental Europe," he writes. "Today, some 16 percent of Dutch schools perform below par, compared with 1 to 5 percent of below-par schools in the nonchoice systems of Sweden, Denmark, Japan and South Korea." What these nations do share is a national curriculum. Mr. Hirsch believes that establishing a common curriculum will do far more to make our schools better and more equitable than school choice will alone.
Progressive educators like Mr. Sizer contend that "national standards" will simply lead to more standardized testing. Mr. Hirsch recognizes the limitations of many standarized tests, and offers suggestions for making them both more nuanced and more comprehensive. And he cautions against state governments' using such tests as a "blunt legislative instrument" to impose reform; they must also provide the resources necessary to make meeting such standards possible. But Mr. Hirsch maintains that such tests are far fairer than more subjective means of assessing student performance, such as "portfolios" -- compilations of students' creative work -- which are currently in vogue. And he points to countries like France, where even recent immigrants perform well on national tests that are based on a common curriculum. In short, there's something here for everyone to hate -- partly because Mr. Hirsch is so refreshingly unpolemical. His book presents a sophisticated, scholarly and often compelling argument and it deserves serious consideration, whatever one's political predilections. 
 Mr. Hirsch begins by challenging "the false polarity" between different methods of teaching -- "traditional versus modern," "boring versus interesting," "fragmented versus integrated" -- and by sensibly noting that a good teacher can make almost any subject interesting. "The presumption that the affairs of one's neighborhood are more interesting than those of faraway times and places," he writes, "is contradicted in every classroom that studies dinosaurs and fairy tales." He points out that even such simple issues as desk placement have taken on epic importance. "Placing the desks in semicircles or helter-skelter symbolized the triumph of good, free, modern education over inhumane, artificial, constraining traditional education."
 Many of these ideas derive directly from Rousseau and the Romantics, who thought that children should develop naturally, uncorrupted by civilization and book learning. But as Mr. Hirsch shows, the maxim "teach the child, not the subject" has been prevalent in the better education schools since at least the 1930's. (Mr. Hirsch's own academic field is not education: a professor of English at the University of Virginia, he is also the author of books on Blake and Wordsworth.) As Emerson complained, "We are shut up in schools . . . for 10 or 15 years & come out at last with a bellyfull of words & do not know a thing." It's perhaps poetic justice that Emerson's books are no longer read, partly because his anti-intellectual attitude has flourished. Mr. Hirsch describes Huck Finn as the "archetypal American antibook figure," who decides to "light out for the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me and sivilize me, and I can't stand it." But this was easy for Twain to say; he already had book learning -- as has anyone who reads about Huck's adventures. It's this hypocritical attitude of the scholarly Twain toward his unsophisticated subject that many well-meaning educators, according to Mr. Hirsch, also display toward their disadvantaged students.
 Mr. Hirsch argues that our schools, in general, do little to improve the economic chances of poor children, and he blames progressive theories of education, which emphasize how children learn rather than what they learn, for this failure. And he suggests that interest in the Internet and other technology has only served to reinforce this inequity by convincing educators that the ability to "access" information, rather than knowledge of particular subjects, will be of primary importance in the 21st century. But research in cognitive psychology completely contradicts such assumptions. You can't learn only how to learn about, say, the Civil War. To learn about any subject, you have to build on previous knowledge -- what cognitive psychologists call "domain specific" information -- which in turn makes more learning possible.
 This is what we mean when we talk about the "learning curve" of a new subject being steep. The more books one reads about the Civil War, the easier they are to read because the main characters in the story become increasingly familiar. But the ability to read about American history doesn't necessarily translate into the ability to read, say, about physics or Shakespeare. To the novice, these subjects have their own daunting and unfamiliar vocabularies.
 When Mr. Hirsch talks about "cultural literacy," what he's talking about is the full set of information, both fragmentary and complete, that a person possesses about not only culture but economics, history, science and math. Without such "intellectual capital," just reading a newspaper, with its references like "supply and demand," "Machiavellian tactics," "black holes" or "The Picture of Dorian Gray," can be overwhelming. The point
 isn't to memorize a list of phrases or words, but to have a working knowledge of enough subject areas to be able to decipher new information in a variety of disciplines as it comes along. Mr. Hirsch adduces Alfred North Whitehead's remark that the point of learning isn't to "cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing," as many educators claim, but to extend "the number of operations which we can perform without thinking about them." A child who must think about the meaning of every word in a story reads with great difficulty; it's only once reading becomes automatic that he or she can move on to "higher thinking" skills, such as understanding the motivations of a character or the causes of the Civil War.
 "The home, by default, and not the school . . . supplies most of the intellectual capital which enables children to acquire more," Mr. Hirsch argues, and it's this "discrepancy between students who are lucky enough to have gained the needed background knowledge at home and those who have to depend mainly on what they get sporadically in school" that results in the failure of many public schools to improve the economic fortunes of poorer children. "The learning of luckier students snowballs upon their initial advantage, while that of the less fortunate ones, dependent on what the incoherent American school offers, never even begins to gather momentum."
 For this reason, Mr. Hirsch sees the creation of a national curriculum, assessed by improved, content-based standardized exams, as the necessary precondition of greater equity and excellence in American education. Furthermore, for a population as mobile as America's, a national curriculum is the only way to assure that students who move frequently can pick up in their new schools where they left off in their old ones. He cites staggering statistics: one-fifth of all Americans relocate every year. A sixth of all third graders attend at least three different schools between the first and third grades. "In a typical inner-city school, only about half the students who start in September are still there in May."
 In "Horace's Hope: What Works for the American High School," Theodore R. Sizer offers an unconvincing rebuttal to Mr. Hirsch's arguments. Mr. Sizer is the chairman of the Coalition of Essential Schools, a nationwide association of very successful public schools. (Interestingly, he proves their success by citing the scores on standardized tests that he elsewhere criticizes.) All share Mr. Sizer's pedagogical philosophy, which advocates a kind of "less is more" and "integrated" approach to teaching; students might explore a single subject for several months and then present an "exhibition" of their work to demonstrate what they've learned. Mr. Sizer insists that his schools provide an intellectually rigorous environment, and I'm sure that they do, but he's too doctrinaire that his way is the only way. Mr. Hirsch, by contrast, applauds project-based learning, as long as it covers the necessary material.
 The bigger problem with the progressive movement has less to do with its methods per se than with the great difficulty of replicating its successes on a larger scale. As Mr. Hirsch points out, several generations of teachers have gone to education schools, received the gospel according to John Dewey, taught for many years and even retired. Still, progressive educators continue to insist that their ideas have not been "properly tried." Perhaps they haven't been. As Mr. Sizer himself acknowledges, creating a truly progressive school is not easy. But there's something ultimately impractical about a reform program that is so difficult to implement.
 Even Horace, Mr. Sizer's fictional composite character, introduced in 1984 in "Horace's Compromise," his landmark study of the American high school, has been at his reforms for quite a while. Mr. Sizer created Horace to express the collective frustrations of many high school teachers in "factory model" schools, and at first Horace seemed like an inspired device. In "Horace's School" (1992), he reappeared to help establish a reform program at his fictional school, Franklin High, and Mr. Sizer's imagined battles with parents, fellow teachers and administrators were entertaining and instructive. But in "Horace's Hope," the last installment in the trilogy, Horace seems a little worn out. Isn't it time that he collected his pension and retired?
 There is a case to be made for Horace's brand of reform, but Mr. Sizer fails to make it in this book. Horace's observations mostly seem like afterthoughts to Mr. Sizer's arguments. His writing is uncharacteristically uneven. He is at his best when describing the structural obstacles to good teaching: enormous schools and classes that prevent individual contact between teachers and students, no matter what the manner of instruction. But to judge by his own criteria -- that is, as an "exhibition" of higher thinking -- "Horace's Hope" is disappointing. Mr. Hirsch's book is far more substantial.

HEADLINE: The 'Black' for '02 Open: Bow to Public Courses

BYLINE: By DAVID WINZELBERG 

 BODY:
SINCE it opened 60 years ago, the Black course at Bethpage State Park has been the course that Long Island golfers love to hate. From its strangling rough to its myriad of sand traps, its layout has frustrated even the best of players.
"Golfers like the challenge to try and defeat the Black," said Larry Schwartz of Huntington, who estimated that he has played the course in Farmingdale 100 times. "It's a masochistic sport." 
 "There is a certain challenge, a certain mystique," said Patrick Rossetti of Massapequa, who has been battling the Black for nine years. "It's a really great public course. There aren't that many, and this is one of them."
Triple bogeys notwithstanding, golfers have always pointed to the Black with pride as the crown jewel of public golf. Now the course, one of the most challenging in the Northeast, will be the site of the U.S. Open in 2002, confirming what Long Island golfers already knew.
"We've always known the course is a gem," Jim Evans, director of golf for Long Island state parks and a former Bethpage supervisor, said. "A guy with $20 can say, 'This is my home course, and the U.S. Open is going to be played here.' "
The U.S.Golf Association will use 3,500 volunteers to help manage the crowds of 25,000 to 30,000 people a day expected at Bethpage for the U.S. Open. Three days of practice rounds will precede the four-day tournament, in which a field of 156 players will compete for more than $2.5 million in prize money, and the prestige that comes with winning one of the four most coveted titles in the golfing world.
On a bench near the starter's booth on a recent Sunday afternoon, Paul Martingale of Lynbrook said that it would be "pretty slick" to be the host course. "I'll be able to see the shots that they're taking," Martingale said. "I'll know every hole that they're playing."
"This is the first time a government-owned golf course will have ever hosted the U.S. Open, and it's because Bethpage Black is such a great public course," said Bernadette Castro, State Commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.
Except for the Pebble Beach Golf Links in California, where greens fees and a cart can cost $295, the Open has never been played at a true public course.
"It has been categorized as a private sport for the rich," the executive director of the Metropolitan Golf Association, Jay Mottola, said. "But that's not the orientation of the game today. This reinforces that. It's good for golf."
"Most of the outstanding golf courses are private, but most golf played is public," said David Fay, executive director of the United States Golf Association, "Bethpage is the quintessential public facility."
According to state parks officials, Bethpage is the largest public golf complex in the country. Once dubbed the "people's country club," golfers played more than 300,000 rounds on the five courses there last last year, generating $4.8 million in revenue.
A sixth course may be added, said Edward Wankel, deputy commissioner of operations. That course would be built through a public-private partnership on 175 mostly unused acres in the northwestern corner of the park, behind the picnic area. The new course could open by 1999.
The original complex is built around the former Lenox Hills Country Club, which the state purchased in 1929, and became what is now the Green course. That was followed by the Blue, the Red and the Black in the 1930's. The Yellow course was added in the 50's.
The Black was designed by Albert W. Tillinghast, who also designed the Red and the Blue. Many major championships, including U.S. Opens, have been played on other Tillinghast courses, which include Baltusrol in Springfield, N.J., and Winged Foot in Mamaroneck in Westchester County.
"Golf courses have pedigrees," Mr. Fay said. "And the Black has a very prominent pedigree. Tillinghast was one of the finest golf course architects of all time."
"You are talking about Rembrandt in terms of golf," said Chuck Workman, the head pro for 14 years."The course has kept up with modern technology. The ball has improved. The clubs have improved. But the integrity of the golf course is still there."
Some of Mr. Tillinghast's innovations, like elevated greens, structured bunkers and false fronts, are used on the Black, but according to Mr. Workman, it was his use of the natural terrain, including the prevailing winds, that makes the course so good.
"Tillinghast was a genius," an assistant supervisor, Mickey Walsh, said. "You can play another golf course and maybe remember two or three holes. After you play the Black, you remember something about every hole."
Mr. Walsh began as a maintenance worker at Bethpage in 1964, when the greens were cut by hand. Today a crew of five maintains the Black, less than half the industry standard, according to Mr. Walsh.
"I wouldn't match it to a country club," the manager, Jim Larsen, said.
Mr. Larsen added that some private clubs employed up to 15 or 16 workers for each course.
The Black is also open seven days and is closed once every two weeks, making maintenance difficult. At the height of the season play begins at first light, as early as 5 A.M. Around 9 P.M. the last golfers may be just coming off the course.
Because of its heavy use, the Black has been tamed somewhat in recent years. "We've made some changes to speed up play and make it more enjoyable for the weekend golfer," Mr. Larsen said. "We've tried to eliminate some of the hazard."
But despite those efforts, the course continues to feature its four-inch rough and 76 sand traps. "There are traps out there bigger than your backyard," said Mr. Walsh.
The par 71 Black plays to 7,065 yards from the blue championship tees, but the layout has a rating of 75.4 from the Metropolitan Golf Association, one of the highest in the New York metropolitan region.
To prepare for the Open, the Black will be tougher, with new tee boxes, deeper rough and, yes, even more sand. "There are traps out there that haven't even been used," Mr. Larsen said. "There are grass bunkers now. But they will be filled in with sand."
According to Mr. Fay, the U.S.G.A. will spend $1.5 million to $2 million to improve the course, with the major work on expanding some greens and the 18th hole. "There's not much you need to do," he added. "Just a shower, shave and a change of clothes."
The makeover is to begin in July, and the course could be closed as long as nine months during the work.
"They will improve it even further," Mr. Rossetti said. "There's no downside to having the U.S. Open."
Officials estimate that the tournament will inject $25 million into the economy. "There is a tremendous amount of benefit in having the Open," Ms. Castro said. "It's good for golf. It's good for the economy. It's a real lift for Long Island."
In addition to fees and admission revenue, the Long Island economy can expect to benefit through restaurants, hotels, car rental agencies, television crews and print press and various suppliers and supporters.
Long Island is no stranger to championship golf. In the 1920's and 30's legends like Walter Hagen, Bobby Jones and Gene Sarazen won major championships on Long Island courses, playing at the Inwood Country Club in Far Rockaway and the Fresh Meadow Country Club in Great Neck.
Besides the Northville Classic, which brings the Senior Professional Golf Association Tour to the Meadow Brook Club in Jericho each year, the last major events on the Island were the U. S. Opens in 1986 and 1995, at Shinnecock Hills in Southampton.
The Black is no stranger to tournaments. It has been host to the Metropolitan Open and the New York State Open.
Although the U.S. Open is six years away, speculation has begun over how the world's top players will fare.
"They'll have some good rounds," an assistant pro at Bethpage, Hiram Ruiz, said. "But they'll have some big ones, too."
"The course won't be eaten up," said Mr. Larsen.
"I think it's going to be an exceptional challenge," said Mr. Fay, whose job will be to determine how tightly to set up the course.
In the meantime, the Black will be around to confound seekers of par, who will still be greeted by the sign that reads, "Warning -- the Black course is an extremely difficult course which we recommend only for highly skilled golfers."
Then again, there is always the Yellow.
 
Notable Holes on the Black Course
5th Hole, par 4, 446 yards.
The elevated tee affords a scenic view of one of the toughest chances for par on the Island. Only a tee shot of more than 225 yards will clear unforgiving rough and reach the large bunkered fairway. The approach narrows to an elevated green that slopes away and is nearly surrounded by sand.
12th Hole, par 4, 480 yards.
Another big drive, about 230 yards, over bunkers and rough to reach the fairway on this sharp dogleg left, still leaving well more than 200 yards against the prevailing winds to the pin. The two-tier green is protected by traps on the left and one on the right.
15th Hole, par 4, 438 yards.
The fairway of this long par 4 slopes to the right, toward a huge bunker and knee-high rough. Thick woods line the left side. A dead-on approach is needed to hit the small two-tiered green with sand in front and to the left. Miss right and wind up 25 feet below the hole. Too far and land in trees.
17th Hole, par 3, 200 yards.
A tricky and shallow two-tiered green is the reward for clearing all the sand -- nearly 4,000 cubic yards -- that surrounds it. Bring a beach chair if you miss. DAVID WINZELBERG

HEADLINE: Desperation or Simple Greed?

BYLINE: By BILL SLOCUM 

 BODY:
ACCORDING to the state's Uniform Crime Report, which charts all arrests made in Connecticut, there were 30 percent fewer murders last year and burglary complaints declined 13 percent. Even car thefts were down.
But one category is notable for the way it keeps on rising: As with every year since 1992, 1995 was a bully year for embezzlement. Arrests in that category have more than doubled over the last four years, according to the report, to 111 last year, from 47 in 1992. 
 Law enforcement officials say that figure may well continue to rise in 1996. "We are getting more referrals from a variety of state agencies," said the Supervisory Assistant State's Attorney, Julia D. Dewey. "We are seeing all kinds of embezzlement, and the workload for cases is rising dramatically."
Mrs. Dewey heads the statewide prosecution bureau, an arm of the Chief State's Attorney's Office in Rocky Hill, which oversees investigations of white-collar crimes. Even though embezzlement remains statistically a minuscule element of the Connecticut crime scene, Mrs. Dewey said her office has become so inundated with such cases lately that "we could be doing this full-time."
There are many reasons given for the rise in embezzlement arrests, but one gets frequent mention.
"You have to look at the economy," said a spokesman for the State Police, Sgt. Dale Hourigan. "It hasn't been that well. A lot of people are desperate."
Although Connecticut is over the recession of the early 1990's, the recovery has been tepid in comparison to the rest of the country, with only a third of jobs lost returning since 1993, according to the Connecticut Business and Industry Association. Could the continuing popularity of downsizing among many large-scale employers be adding to a morale crunch among Connecticut's workers, enticing more of them to turn to crime?
"I suspect there is some correlation between the economic opportunities available to people and the measures they will take for economic security," said Robert Noonan, a management counselor with the Business and Industry Association. "Some will take illegal measures."
Mr. Noonan noted other possible causes for the rise, including drug use. He said his office gets queries about how to deal with suspicious employees every two weeks or so. "Often it is just petty theft, but occasionally it is more serious," he said.
Mrs. Dewey has a simpler, one-word explanation for the rash of embezzlement cases: Greed.
"Indirectly, money is not as readily available as it was during the 1980's," she said. "Investments have gone up, the real estate market is no longer booming, and life styles are harder to maintain. Conspicuous consumption is still up, if our cases are any indication. That's why we're having the embezzlements, because they are still spending."
Embezzled funds may be used to pay for everything from a child's education to jewelry and cars, Mrs. Dewey said. One woman was arrested after siphoning funds from the charity she worked for to pay for a series of plastic surgery operations.
One reason for the increase in arrests may be that victims, whether businesses or charities, are now more likely to report cases to authorities, rather than settle them privately or in civil court. "Before, businesses didn't want the public to know how easy it was," Mrs. Dewey said.
These days, Mr. Noonan added, "Among our members, I see very little tolerance for an employee shown to be involved in embezzlement."
Chief Inspector Paul J. Healy, who heads Mrs. Dewey's investigative team, cited better enforcement as a likely reason for the arrests. Utilizing the skills of accountants and former police officers, the statewide prosecution bureau looks into suspected cases by establishing a "fact pattern" in which audits and computer charts all play key parts.
In Mr. Healy's area of operations culprits are seldom violent, and often, when plagued by guilt, welcome the opportunity to come clean. "Ninety-five percent of the arrests we make are by appointment," he explained.
Embezzlement can take many forms, from not registering a sale and then pocketing the proceeds to stealing from a company cash register or from a corporate account. Some of the more enterprising schemes take the form of check-kiting or "lapping," in which an employee responsible for recording payments to a company pockets a payment and covers the imbalance by applying part of a larger payment to the incriminating invoice. A well-done lapping scheme can go undetected for years.
Particularly vulnerable to embezzlement are trust funds and estates where a single individual has sole authority.
"A common thread we see is a lack of basic accounting procedures, and a trust where the owner or complainant does not intrude," said Robert A. Brousseau, a fraud examiner with the statewide prosecution bureau.
Indeed, recently a former Evangelical Lutheran Church treasurer from Cheshire was arrested on charges he embezzled $800,000 from the New England Synod of the church. The Chief State's Attorney, John Bailey, noted that the treasurer, a certified public accountant, was able to delay an independent audit by convincing the synod that an independent review was unnecessary and expensive.
One case currently being handled by the State Police in central Connecticut involves Department of Transportation employees who allegedly used computer software-design equipment leased by the state to assist them in performing privately contracted, off-duty jobs. Lieut. John Mannion, head of the State Police central district's major crimes unit, says thousands of dollars in rental fees were unknowingly being paid by the state for the freelance assignments.
The computer is both friend and foe in embezzlement investigations. Mr. Healy called it "a better ally for us than for the perpetrator," since it is harder to conceal incriminating records in a central computer system. But he added those cases in which the computer is used to conceal fraud are "the toughest to solve."
"Ironically, one would assume those with jobs that supposedly require a higher intelligence would perpetuate more complex crimes," he said. "Yet we've found cases where highly educated lawyers do incredibly stupid things, like writing checks to themselves, while less-educated employees funnel embezzled checks through a computer."
One of the most sophisticated instances of embezzlement Mr. Healy recalled took place in an auto-parts store in northeastern Connecticut. The estimated loss was thought to exceed $200,000, but the suspected perpetrator was charged with only a a small fraction of that amount. "This guy was the manager who did the physical inventory, and he was able to delete all the records from the computer," Mr. Healy said.
Mr. Healy said his office routinely and increasingly assists the State Police and local police departments. And the embezzlements are being taken seriously indeed.
"I would compare an embezzler to an armed robber," said Lieut. Timothy Barry, head of the State Police's western district investigative unit. "A robber uses a gun, while the embezzler uses a pencil, but the results are the same."
 
Five Steps for Employers
ROBERT D. NOONAN of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association says business owners who suspect they are being victimized by embezzlers should follow a five-step plan:
1. Consider signs of a potential problem, like an inability to reconcile cash receivable. "It can be worse when an individual has multi-function responsibilities and can fix their trail," he said.
2. If suspicion arises, verify the loss. "It's a fundamental step, but it can be overlooked."
3. If a loss is discovered, draw up an investigation plan. Do so quietly. "It's necessary to identify the source of the losses without bringing attention to the fact the losses have been discovered."
4. Begin a process to establish or refute the conclusion that one or more employees are involved in wrongdoing. "This may involve an internal group of managers working in conjunction with a corporate counsel, law enforcement and auditors."
5. Once you identify someone as being involved in an improper activity, the management team should guide the company's handling of the suspect or suspects. Mr. Noonan recommends caution, noting that charging an employee with embezzlement without adequate cause can invite a lawsuit.
Finally, the company must decide whether to lodge criminal charges or pursue. the matter through civil means. "You may have an employee exercising poor judgment who may not think he or she is breaking the law," Mr. Noonan explained. "In other cases, it's more clear they are involved in an illegal activity."

HEADLINE: Hospital Care In the Face Of More Mergers

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
UNAWARE that changes at hospitals have left administrators wringing their hands, Simona Harrison hobbled out of the White Plains Hospital Center here on a recent afternoon blissfully unconcerned. At that moment, she was only happy that recent advances in medical care had allowed her to be going home after just a few short hours.
"It seemed like I was in and out of there in almost no time," said Mrs. Harrison, an Ossining resident who underwent orthoscopic surgery in the morning for a torn cartilage on her right knee. "All I know is that for me, everything was great." 
 Mrs. Harrison's speedy recovery from surgery can be attributed in part to state-of-the-art procedures and new drug therapies. In fact, about 60 percent of all surgery performed in recent years is ambulatory, allowing patients to arrive in the morning and return home by evening without having to stay in the hospital even overnight.
Technology, however, is only one reason that Mrs. Harrison's visit was so brief. Managed-care companies are dictating shorter hospital stays, and many doctors and hospital administrators are reporting that patients must be very sick indeed to be admitted -- which comes as good news for most people.
"Who would want to stay overnight when you can be home with your family?" said Richard H. Gabel, a White Plains psychiatrist who had surgery for a ruptured tendon in his ankle. "They treated me royally, told me to ice my foot and keep it elevated -- and sent me home."
For hospitals, though, the emphasis on ambulatory surgery and other forms of outpatient care means more unused beds and less revenue from traditional sources.
Institutions' incomes have been further limited by fee schedules set by managed-care insurers, which tightly control how much hospitals can charge for services.
"Increasingly, there's the pressure to cut costs in what has become a highly competitive market," said Arthur E. Weintraub, president of the Northern Metropolitan Hospital Association, which represents health care institutions in seven counties.
It is within the context of an industry shakeout that Northern Westchester Hospital Center in Mount Kisco and White Plains Hospital Center here announced an agreement on Sept. 17 to affiliate -- the latest in a hurried round of alliances, mergers and other agreements among many hospitals in Westchester.
"It's like everything is on fast forward: we're moving ahead at breakneck speed," Mr. Weintraub said, likening some of the affiliations to shotgun marriages. "The alternative of going solo is not very viable anymore." He said hospitals in New York City and the state hope that by forming larger and more powerful bargaining units, they will be able to meet the insurance companies head on and negotiate better deals.
Other recent affiliation agreements in Westchester have included the merger in June of St. Agnes Hospital in White Plains with Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center in the Bronx under the Our Lady of Mercy Healthcare System.
In Manhattan, two of the oldest and most prestigious hospitals -- New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital Center -- announced in July that they would form one of the largest nonprofit health care systems in the country. That announcement followed news in mid-June that Mount Sinai and New York University Medical Centers would merge. Less than two weeks later, Beth Israel and Long Island Jewish Medical Centers made a similar announcement.
Analysts have said that the mergers signify that New York is finally catching up with the rest of the country. While managed-care providers have not been bound by state-set rates, private indemnity insurers have. That will change on Jan. 1, when New York's new Health Care Reform Act, which many observers are describing as landmark legislation, takes effect.
The new law will open the door to even tougher contract negotiations between all insurers and hospitals, and it is expected that some hospitals may not survive the new pressures. In the meantime, few are waiting for the law to take effect, and most have already formed alliances. These merger vows -- or as some are calling them, marriages of convenience -- have taken many forms, including corporate affiliations, joint ventures and outright mergers.
The arrangement between Northern Westchester Hospital Center and White Plains Hospital Center represents a first in the county between two virtually equal institutions. They have formed a parent corporation, Health Star Network, but the hospitals say there are no plans to consolidate medical services, although they expect to achieve some economies by sharing information systems.
The board of Health Star will have 10 members with equal representation. Walton E. Burdick, chairman of the new corporation, said that the only layoffs expected were through attrition and each hospital would continue its own mission.
Other arrangements have involved a stronger institution assisting a weaker one, as is the case with St. John's Riverside Hospital in Yonkers and Yonkers General Hospital, which is classified by the state as a financially distressed institution.
A similar arrangement has been struck between New Rochelle Hospital Medical Center and Mount Vernon Hospital, which is also classified as financially distressed.
"Especially a hospital like ours cannot afford to stand alone," said Richard L. Petrillo, the chief executive officer at the Mount Vernon institution.
The two hospitals formed a holding company to gain leverage in contract negotiations with insurers by representing more people and covering a broader area, said John R. Spicer, the chief executive officer at New Rochelle Hospital Medical Center.
The hospitals will share services like housekeeping, information management and human resources. In addition, Mount Vernon, which has sent very sick babies to New York City hospitals, will now send them to New Rochelle's high-risk nursery, and New Rochelle will refer its mental-health patients to the Mount Vernon institution, which specializes in such services.
At United Hospital Medical Center in Port Chester, Kevin W. Dahill, president and chief executive officer, said his hospital, like the others, had anticipated the changes several years ago and formed a relationship with New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, which became the parent company.
But the hospital also plans to slash its $72 million budget by $8.4 million over the next 18 months, and it has cut about 30 staff positions out of 930 and plans another 30 cuts in the coming months.
"For the first time, we in the hospital business are having to play by the same rules as most businesses in the private sector," he said.
"It's certainly a volatile environment now," he added, "but it's also a great opportunity for those of us who have some vision."
And while most administrators agreed with that sentiment, they also criticized the managed-care groups for what Jon B. Schandler, the president and chief executive office at White Plains Hospital, called "putting the squeeze on us."
At New Rochelle Hospital, Mr. Spicer also complained that the managed-care groups were "calling the shots."
Doctors, too, view the managed-care companies as the enemy. Mark L. Fox, a Scarsdale ear, nose and throat specialist and past president of the Westchester County Medical Society, a professional organization, said his colleagues were angry at the insurers for dictating how care is delivered.
"In the good old days, which was just a couple of years ago, a patient could see any physician in a traditional fee-for-service arrangement," he said.
"But now they come to a specialist only after a primary-care referral," he said, "and as a result, we end up seeing patients that are a lot sicker by they time they follow all the steps the insurers demand."
The managed-care companies, however, see things from a different perspective. "The changes are not unlike any other open-market system," said Leslie S. Moran, a spokeswoman for the Health Maintenance Organization Council of New York in Albany, which insures close to five million people.
She denied that managed-care groups set procedures and rates that jeopardize patient safety, adding: "Whenever an industry reaches a certain penetration in a market, you shift the paradigm and challenge the way things have been done. That makes people nervous."

HEADLINE: Where Machinists Can Get Training

 BODY:
Regarding the lead article ("The New World of (Skilled) Factory Jobs," Sept. 15), I would like your readership to know that Macdac Engineering is pro-actively addressing the shortage of skilled machinists by offering, free of charge, training in off-line Computer Numerical Control (CNC) programming.
This free training is available to unemployed machinists, manufacturers with apprenticeship programs and any shop and vocational school teacher throughout New England. 
 Classes are taught using Mastercam, a widely used manufacturing software system for creating machining programs for milling, lathe and wire EDM CNC machine tools.
As a reseller of Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Manufacturing products and services, we readily recognized the machinist shortage problem several years ago.
Small and mid-sized manufacturers often complained of a lack of skilled workers for hiring.
We felt it was our corporate responsibility to offer training to help reseed the local economy with skilled machinists, educated in the latest technology and enabling New England manufacturers to stay competitive.
As continuing evidence of this shortage, we find that machinists who successfully complete our program are immediately snatched up for jobs by local employers with whom we have a relationship.
We recently expanded our offer to teachers -- who have limited access to CNC programming training and frequently pay for it themselves. By training the area's teachers for free in the industry's No. 1 machining software, we saw it as a way to bring real economic opportunity closer to students interested in the profession.
Macdac believes that apprenticeship programs are the key to revitalizing the region's manufacturing climate because they provide basic skills for a well-rounded machinist. Our training program is also hands-on, teaching apprentices how to program using the actual types of parts their company manufactures -- molds, or tool and die, for example.
To qualify for our training, people need some hands-on machining experience and the ability to read a blueprint. Familiarity with computers is also helpful.
Individuals can get more information or register for the training classes, by contacting us at Macdac, telephone 860-870-8182 or E-mail: info@macdac.com. We offer two convenient New England training sites. Classes are held every other Wednesday at our corporate offices in Ellington and every other Friday at our Northboro, Mass., offices.

HEADLINE: What to Wear to School?

BYLINE: By ROBERT E. TOMASSON 

 BODY:
AS he climbed on the back of his mother's chair while waiting to get a new jacket and pants at the Rogers Magnet School in Stamford, 5-year-old Sam Kesler may not have been especially aware that he was about to adopt one of education's oldest and now newest trademarks: school uniforms.
As old as the nation's parochial and other private schools, school uniforms are being increasingly looked at by public school officials and by parents as a positive tool to instill school pride and discipline while reducing the social and economic competitiveness of children trying to outdress each other. 
 "We wanted to look at reducing the whole issue of 'What am I going to wear to school?' and 'Do I look stylish and in line with someone else?' " said the Rogers School principal, Mary Jennings. The point was to create "more of a sense of belonging to a larger organization that has a meaningful purpose, and that purpose is getting an education."
For Sam's mother, Maureen Kesler, the navy blue jackets and white shirts, as well as the tartan skirts and white blouses for girls, are a positive addition to her son's school.
She was well familiar with uniforms, having spent her childhood in parochial schools. But her son will have an option she did not have: One day a week, Sam will get to wear whatever he wants to school, said Mrs. Kesler, to satisfy whatever sartorial independence he might develop.
For two days this month, scores of parents lined up to make their selections from racks of jackets and skirts and crates of navy socks and clip-on ties along with T-shirts and sweatshirts emblazoned with the school name. Anticipating the voluntary dress code that takes effect Tuesday at Rogers, several children were already wearing the new outfits.
While the State Department of Education does not track the number of public schools that have school uniform programs, queries to uniform companies and local boards indicate that the number is in the range of 40.
In addition to that at Rogers, a voluntary dress code went into effect this month at the Toquam School, another of Stamford's four elementary magnet schools (the city has 12 elementary schools).
In addition to Stamford, the Neil Roberts School Uniform Store is responding to dress programs this fall in Waterbury and New Britain. Bridgeport and New Haven also have dress code programs.
By and large, the adoption of uniforms in public schools seems to be increasing along with the growth of magnet schools with their distinctive curriculums meant to attract students from outside immediate neighborhood school districts.
In its fourth year as a magnet school, Rogers seems to have accomplished much of the turnaround it sought, with the uniforms adding a finishing touch.
The school, situated off Route 1 in a working class area of Stamford, had been a tired, largely segregated institution. Today about half of the 720 students receive free lunches and 64 percent are minority students. About a quarter of the students are selected by lottery from a pool of those seeking to attend one of the four elementary magnet schools.
To a recent visitor who spent two days there, the school presented an exuberant atmosphere with a relaxed discipline. Every classroom in the school -- one of eight nationally that is a demonstration school of the Yale Bush Center for Child Development and Social Policy -- has four computers.
Maureen Tobin, a parent of two children at Rogers, grew up in England where school uniforms are standard. She said she's an enthusiastic supporter of the Rogers program and described the school's academics as "very comparable" to those of Spence, a Manhattan private school her older daughter attended.
But attitudes and implementation of dress codes are by no means standardized. The Toquam Magnet School also adopted a dress code this month that relied on what Evelyn Panos, the assistant principal, termed "attitude orientations."
Instead of inviting a uniform company to the school, the school has started a campaign aimed at establishing "a very positive dress code" that pointedly excludes T-shirts and droopy pants. Samples of appropriate clothing are displayed and parents are told of stores where they may be bought.
Elsewhere, two other schools are illustrative not only of different dress codes but also of the extremes of public education in Connecticut.
One of the first public schools in the state to adopt uniforms was the Helene Grant School in New Haven where the experience over past last eight years was described as fantastic by the principal, Jeffie Frazier. "It has given the children self-esteem, promoted creativity," said Mrs. Frazier, and created greater classroom participation by children previously inhibited because of what they felt was their inadequate appearance.
The dress program at Helene Grant is atypical -- mandatory, albeit tacitly. "Parents who send their children here know we have a dress code," Mrs. Frazier explained.
Eric G. Norfeldt: A Classical Education is the name of a new magnet school that opened this fall in West Hartford. The principal, Penny Jojin, described a regimen of heavy homework, French in kindergarten and Latin in the fifth grade. Mrs. Jojin had been in favor of establishing a dress code, perhaps embellished by a school emblem similar to those of private schools.
After extensive discussion with parents, three options were offered: school uniforms or a dress code to include rules such as tucked-in shirts and mandatory belts or keeping the status quo where students and their parents made individual choices on dress. The overwhelming response, the principal said, was for the status quo.
Mrs. Jojin said that the school is in a largely white, affluent area, and that while students from outside the district have boosted the minority enrollment to about 12 percent, many of the traditional arguments used in favor of school uniforms (the need to suppress gang colors, for example) did not apply.
There seems little chance that school uniforms will progress beyond elementary schools.
In New Britain, where two magnet schools have had successful uniform programs, parents and students were asked their opinions. The assistant superintendent of schools, Dr. James Rhinesmith, said that parents of high school students showed little interest in uniforms, and that while the parents of middle school students liked the idea, their children did not.
In the elementary schools, he said, parents and students alike supported the regimented program.

BYLINE: By AARON LATHAM; AARON LATHAM's contribution to Hollywood rides was the mechanical bull in "Urban Cowboy," for which he wrote the screenplay.

 BODY:
"HOW wet do you want to get?" asked the guide. "Very," said my 19-year-old daughter. "Then sit in the front row." The big wooden doors -- proclaiming JURASSIC PARK -- swung slowly open like jaws, and we floated inside.
Riding up front in an inflatable rubber raft, my daughter, Taylor, and I entered a spacious, peaceful lagoon. The theme music from the movie welcomed us to a tranquil, lost world. The big California sky poured down sunshine and illuminated the pale green foliage. This place was wonderful, but I wasn't fooled. I had been warned: The bottom was going to fall out. 
 Our 25-passenger raft drifted down a creek that got narrower and narrower. The plants grew thicker and closer, seeming to advance on us. The leaves got darker now, blocking out much of the light. Gently rippling waterfalls gave way to geysers. A 50-foot ultrasaurus ate a tree.
On the left bank, two small "compy" dinosaurs fought over a Jurassic Park popcorn box. The disembodied voice of the actor Richard Kiley, our host on the tour, explained that great pains had been taken to make sure that the dinosaurs ate a properly balanced diet. We all smiled, but I still kept wondering: When was the bottom going to fall out?
Fog rolled in. A stegosaurus mother, protecting her child, swung her plated tail at us. The water ran faster and darker. Something was wrong. The electrical fences were shorting out. A wrecked Jeep dangled from a guard rail directly over our heads. An empty raft drifted by carrying a turkey-sized "spitter" dinosaur: It reared up and spat at us!
But we were still all right. When was the bottom going to fall out?
Alarms clanged, pipes broke, a catwalk collapsed. Then we saw the gap in the fence that was supposed to protect us from the predators. Our raft veered into the bedlam of a pumping station coming apart at the seams.
Then the bottom fell out!
Our raft plunged straight down in total darkness.
Jurassic Park -- The Ride opened as part ofUniversal Studios Hollywood this summer and has been setting records ever since. The area's attendance is up an amazing 40 percent over last year. On July 5, it set a one-day record of 43,000 visitors. (At about $30 a ticket, that works out to almost $1.3 million for one day.) The ride is so big that it has even been credited with helping to fuel a new tourist boom in California, which had struggled after years of earthquakes, riots, and recession. Tourism is expected to be up about 6 percent statewide this year.
Actually a visit to Universal Studios isn't a tour in the way, say, a tour of Venice is a tour. A guide doesn't point out this building on the right and that other one on the left. There aren't any churches or museums or many other landmarks. Nor is there a behind-the-scenes look at Hollywood at work, which would really be quite boring since movie making is the slowest business on earth next to fossil manufacture.
What Universal Studios Hollywood really is is a trip into what it feels like to be in a movie. It's not about what it's like to be an actor in a film, but rather what it's like to be a character in a Hollywood adventure story. It isn't about what Laura Dern experiences, but rather what "Dr. Ellie Sattler" goes through.
"We try to create situations that allow you to be a participant, not a passive observer," says Phil Hettema, who was the lead designer on the Jurassic Park ride. "We want you to be the hero of the story."
This approach applies not only to Jurassic Park, but also to most of the other rides in the park.
When I came face to face with King Kong inside an innocent-looking sound stage, I wasn't worried about what he was going to do to Fay Wray: I was concerned about what he was about to do to me. I felt like a Nathan's hot dog looking into hungry eyes.
Later, as we rode a Bay Area subway, I felt the earth begin to shake. Water mains broke. Wires broke and crackled. A police car slammed into the side of our subway car and knocked us off the rails. I had an experience entirely different from anything felt by Charlton Heston or Ava Gardner. They did their quake scenes in hundreds of boring pieces, but the tour puts the pieces together and plays them at full speed. I grabbed my daughter and held on tight. She laughed at me. Then a 60,000-gallon flood slammed the car.
Having somehow survived the Big One, No. 7 on the Richter scale, we made our way Back to the Future -- or at any rate to a ride by that name. We climbed aboard Doc Brown's time machine, a converted DeLorean. I naturally hit my head on one of the silver winglike doors. We strapped ourselves in and took off through time chasing a villain who was a threat to the time-space continuum. The time machine rose, flew, dodged this way and that and then headed right at the clock tower in the old town square. Look out!
Now we were more in a movie than ever, for we weren't hurtling at a real tower but rather one projected on a screen that was eight stories high. But it certainly felt as if we were about to hit bricks and mortar. Ouch! We crashed right through the clock -- our DeLorean shuddered -- and we found ourselves flying over the crackly, smoky volcanic crust of the new and cooling Earth. Our DeLorean flew right down the throat of an erupting volcano. Then we were in the age of the dinosaurs. A big rex gave us a toothy smile and we flew down his throat, too.
Coming off the ride, I not only felt carsick but didn't know any more about filming special effects than I did when I went in. But the object wasn't to impart information but to provide a feeling. Back to the Future -- The Ride is an extension of the film maker's art rather than just another stop on a tour. It mixes actual movement, effects like real smoke, overwhelming sound and a wrap-around visual world. The Back to the Future ride suggests a possible road to the movies' future.
And now forward to the past: In 1915, a movie pioneer named Carl Laemmle bought the 230-acre Taylor chicken ranch on the north side of the Hollywood Hills. He set up a motion picture studio on the ranch, but he kept the chickens. Laemmle figured movies might go out of fashion, but eggs wouldn't.
To help defray the cost of movie making, he decided to sell tickets to people who wanted to see his movies being made. He charged them 25 cents, which included a box lunch with chicken and egg salad sandwiches. The spectators watched from bleachers where they were encouraged to cheer the heros and boo the villains. The directors told the crowds that the actors usually did a better job if they were given noisy encouragement. Of course, the movies being made were silent. As the spectators were leaving the studio, they were offered a good deal on eggs and many bought.
When sound came along in 1927, the Universal tour was shut down because the spectators made too much noise. The studio also had to get rid of its zoo -- 30 lions, 10 leopards, elephants and lots of monkeys -- because the animals were noisy too.
After a lapse of almost four decades, Universal came up with a concept for reviving the tour, and again it involved lunch. In 1964, when the studio noticed that its commissary wasn't doing much business, it decided to allow tour buses to stop for lunch at Universal.
This business was so successful that it soon expanded to include a visit to the commissary basement where visitors were treated to a makeup demonstration by a movie professional. They also got a close-up look at some of Edith Head's Oscar-winning costumes. And a couple of stunt men showed up to put on a phony fight.
So was born the Universal Studios Tour sequel. The staff consisted of a ticket seller ($2.50 for adults and $1.50 for children), two guides and two bus drivers. That first year the tour recorded 39,000 tickets sold -- considerably less than its new single-day record. Now over five million people visit each year.
Lots of the early visitors came hoping to see stars and many were disappointed, but not all. John Wayne used to drop in at tour headquarters to eat hot dogs at lunch. Telly (Kojak) Savalas often handed out lollipops to visitors. John Travolta once plowed his car into a tour bus and stayed to chat.
But one of the most fascinating stories involves not somebody running into the tour but someone running away from it. When he was just 18, Steven Spielberg took the Universal Studios Tour. He went AWOL, simply wandering away from the tour to explore on his own. He soon picked out a likely looking bungalow, sneaked inside, found an empty office, and set up shop. The next day, he entered the studio, carrying an empty briefcase (except for lunch), walked knowingly past the studio guard, and reported to "his" office. This time he brought along some plastic letters so he could add his name to the bungalow's directory. So Steven Spielberg went to "work" at Universal. His foot in the door, however insecurely, he met studio executives, impressed them . . . and shortly went on to make "Jaws," "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," "E.T.," and "Jurassic Park," all for Universal, his original Hollywood "home." That Universal tour keeps paying dividends of one kind and another.
Of course, now Mr. Spielberg helps design the tour that originally brought him to the studio. His involvement began in earnest with the transformation of his movie "E.T." into a ride. He wanted to put visitors in the bicycle seat and let them ride over the city that appears in perfect miniature below. Then he added a development not seen in the movie: We go "home" with E.T. to his planet. The E.T. Adventure opened in 1991.
Having enjoyed that ride, Spielberg then threw himself into the amusement park version of his "Jurassic Park." Universal spent $110 million on the ride, which is about what a high-tech adventure movie usually costs.
We hit the bottom of the black hole. I was shaken but thankful to be alive and to have the big one behind me. Our raft started to struggle up out of the dark abyss. My breathing was slowly returning to normal. I smiled benignly on my daughter. I liked this ride. I was feeling just what the ride designers wanted me to feel.
Then I saw the most frightening monster that ever shook the earth with its heavy steps. A Tyrannosaurus rex four stories tall stood astride our poor creek. He came at us out of the shadows of nightmare. I stared up at a toothy head that was as big and heartless as a cement truck.
Then the bottom really did drop out! While I and everybody else were staring up at the king of tyrants, the earth simply fell away. This ride had quite deliberately outmaneuvered us . . . convinced us the worst was over . . . waited for us to relax our guard . . . then fired its biggest gun. The fear of falling is one of mankind's oldest, most primal fears. Falling and dragons! We had both. Our raft pointed almost straight down. I told myself to hang on because it would be over soon. But it just wouldn't end. We fell and fell and fell . . . 84 feet, the longest man-made water drop in the world.
Then we hit the lagoon below and a tidal wave engulfed us. I have never been wetter, not even scuba diving. Every freckle was wet. Every hair was drenched. Every piece of paper in my wallet was soaking and turning back into wood pulp. Maybe that's what killed the dinosaurs: they all drowned.
While I tried to catch my breath, Taylor pointed out a shaving cream can lying on the bank of the lagoon. It looked like the red-white-and-blue can in which the greedy movie villain tried to steal some dinosaur embryos from Jurassic Park. But what were these embryos doing here? And what would happen if the can somehow floated out to sea? What disasters would occur if the dinosaurs escaped from the island? Our ride was ending, but there was clearly going to be more trouble ahead.
How long would it be before this ride, like the movie, had a sequel? We would be back.
Several years ago, my Hollywood agent told me that one good way to sell a movie idea was to come up with the ride first. I laughed. I thought she was kidding.

HEADLINE: Getting Ahead;
America Remains No. 1

BYLINE: By Ronald Steel; Ronald Steel is Shapiro Visiting Professor of International Affairs at George Washington University.

 BODY:
We imagine the past and create the future in its image. People in 1896 got much of the coming century wrong; we are unlikely to do much better. Here is how some of the operating myths of 1996 might collapse:

The Information Age Is Knitting the World Together. Russians gobble Big Macs. Children in Bangladesh wear Chicago Bulls T-shirts. CNN beams America around the globe, creating a community of news junkies that leaps cultural walls and defies censors. English is the universal language and the Internet the tribune of the people. Now we will all be one. Right?
Wrong. The notion of a global village is a product of our self-congratulation and worship of technology. We assume that if everyone sees the same programs they will espouse similar values. And since we provide much of the world's pop culture, won't everyone adopt our values?
Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. When we see our products and images abroad we think of it as Americanization. For others, it is just modernization. Eating pizza and playing soccer doesn't make us Italian, any more than drinking Coke or playing baseball turns the Japanese into Americans. Sometimes the more people know about one another, the more they find to dislike. Take a feuding family. Or a civil war, as in Bosnia or Rwanda, to use a couple of current examples. The telephone doesn't make us love one another. Why should the Internet?

Capitalism Will Always Rule the World. Today, capitalism is riding high, and Socialism (along with its utopian apotheosis, Communism) has been confined to what Leon Trotsky called the "dustbin of history." Memories are short. Only 50 years ago, socialism was the wave of the future. Britain and France were nationalizing their industries, while backward places like China and India hailed the Soviet Union as a model of fast growth.
All that seems bizarre now. Everyone wants to be a capitalist, even former commissars. Capitalism distributes resources efficiently and produces a pile of money, but it always has, along with big booms and bad busts.
It was because capitalism destroyed even as
it created that Socialist parties were formed in Europe and America a century ago. Capitalism survived because its own excesses were tamed through government intervention: pensions and health insurance for workers, welfare to buy off the poor. Left to its own devices, it periodically spins out of control. Then it goes into the dustbin for a while.

The Refugee Problem Is Manageable. Everyone knows that the world's population is growing too fast -- 6 billion today versus 1.5 billion 100 years ago -- but hardly anyone wants to deal with it. Thanks to advances in agriculture and medicine, more poor people survive in the impoverished countries where population growth is fastest. But unable to find jobs or live off the depleted land, they swarm into megacities like Sao Paulo, Lagos and Calcutta. And they spill across borders into richer places like Texas and California, France and Germany. We like to assume that tough immigration laws will stem the tide. They won't. The great migration from the world's slums is only just beginning.

Democracy Will Triumph. Democracy is infectious and inevitable, or so we believe. It has already come to most of Eastern Europe and Russia, as well as Latin America. Even the Chinese are getting restless. But democracy can mean many things -- for some, the liberty to do whatever they please, for others the ability to express opinions freely and to choose their governors. For the 30 million Russians who voted Communist in the recent Presidential elections, it means high living for a few and misery for just about everyone else. And in the fast-growing economic "tigers" of Asia, in societies that put a high premium on order, security and tradition, it suggests anarchy.
For democracies to work, they must deliver the goods. Where they fail, the people will turn against them -- as the Germans did in 1933 when they voted Hitler into power. Democracy is not easily transplanted; some societies find it disruptive and a threat to traditional values. Its virtue is that the public's voice is heard powerfully. Its weakness is that it can degenerate into demagoguery and anarchy. The whole world does not have to be democratic for us to make our way in it. And it won't be.

China Will Be the Next Superpower. Of course China will dominate the next century. It's big, industrious and growing fast. What's to stop it? Maybe the Chinese themselves.
For centuries China has been the great emerging power and the bogy man of the West. Napoleon warned that when it awoke the world would be sorry. Our own strategists today have found in China a replacement for the Soviet Bear.
But this scenario tells us more about ourselves than about China. There will be 300 million to 400 million more Chinese over the next 20 years, yet there is little more arable land. Millions of hungry peasants are fleeing to the cities. Conflicts have broken out between the capital and the provinces, between industrial and agricultural regions and between powerful economic and military factions. The Soviet state disintegrated to the astonishment of virtually every expert. So may China.

The Wretched Will Always Accept Their Lot. Nobody says this openly, but it is what most governments think. Although we have always had the rich and the poor, the gap between them has been growing. This is particularly true of the United States, where the distribution of wealth is now in a class with Guatemala. Not only people, but whole countries are growing poorer. Wealth has become so concentrated that 358 billionaires worldwide control assets greater than the combined national incomes of countries with 45 percent of the world's population.
The haves assume that nothing much needs to be done about this. They figure that with enough cops, prisons and gated enclaves, the situation will be manageable -- Watts won't march on Beverly Hills, or Central Americans on gringoland, or Africans on manicured Europe. Maybe. That's what the rich have always assumed. Sometimes they were right, and sometimes they were sorry.

The Nation-State Is Withering Away. What is the function of the state today? It feeds atavistic passions, sends its citizens off to wars and interferes with the global market. Surely it will fade in the 21st century, when everyone is joined together by a common language, English, and worships the same god, commerce.
Don't bet on it. Nations may merge their economies, but people resist giving up their national identities. The European Union has run into a brick wall of member states that don't want to disappear into a Brussels bureaucracy. The Soviet Union disintegrated, and Yugoslavia splintered into warring ethnic states. People like to belong to a clan. The nation-state, in one form or another, will survive.

The United States Will Decline. The hardest thing about being on top is staying there. History is a chronicle of great empires that have disappeared in a trail of decaying monuments. Will the United States go the same way?
Not soon. Who is to challenge us? Japan is dependent on imported resources and foreign markets. China is a demographic disaster ripe for a return to warlordism. India verges on explosion and anarchy. Brazil has forever been the country of tomorrow. Europe will never be more than a big, and contentious, shopping mall. Russia has always been a phantom giant.
What's more, it is asked, why would anyone want to challenge us? The United States is a "benevolent hegemon." We covet no one else's territory, demand no monetary tribute. Rather than exploiting our allies, we are exploited by them: providing security from enemies, insuring access to cheap oil and running up huge trade deficits buying their goods. We are the friendly cop on the beat, and it is in everyone's interest to keep us there.
At least so we say, and so we mean. But there are two problems with this picture. First is the predicament of the overextended superpower that puts so much of its wealth into feeding its military and protecting its allies that it fails to keep up economically. Second is the fact that rising nations don't like to take orders, even from the best-intentioned protector. Adolescents want to be, and will be, adults.
The United States will remain No. 1 in the foreseeable future. But 2096 is a long time away.
Nothing Will Happen to Knock All Predictions Into a Hat. In 1896, Americans and Europeans basked in a golden age of prosperity and perpetual progress. They were rich, self-confident and optimistic. Then came 1914 and the war that defied all reason, the war that tore Europe apart, undermined the values of the Victorian age, spawned the Russian Revolution, opened the doors to Fascism and Communism, sowed the seeds of World War II and degenerated into the Holocaust. The world has not been the same since. When the unimaginable happens, and it can, all bets are off.

HEADLINE: Church and State;
Fraternity Reigns

BYLINE: By Richard Rorty; Richard Rorty is University Professor of the Humanities at the University of Virginia and the author of numerous books of philosophy, among them Contingency, Irony and Solidarity.

 BODY:
Our long, hesitant, painful recovery, over the last five decades, from the breakdown of democratic institutions during the Dark Years (2014-2044) has changed our political vocabulary, as well as our sense of the relation between the moral order and the economic order. Just as 20th-century Americans had trouble imagining how their pre-Civil War ancestors could have stomached slavery, so we at the end of the 21st century have trouble imagining how our great-grandparents could have legally permitted a C.E.O. to get 20 times more than her lowest-paid employees. We cannot understand how Americans a hundred years ago could have tolerated the horrific contrast between a childhood spent in the suburbs and one spent in the ghettos. Such inequalities seem to us evident moral abominations, but the vast majority of our ancestors took them to be regrettable necessities.
As long as their political discourse was dominated by the notion of "rights" -- whether "individual" or "civil" -- it was hard for Americans to think of the results of unequal distribution of wealth and income as immoral. Such rights talk, common among late-20th-century liberals, gave conservative opponents of redistributionist policies a tremendous advantage: "the right to a job" (or "to a decent wage") had none of the resonance of "the right to sit in the front of the bus" or "the right to vote" or even "the right to equal pay for equal work." Rights in the liberal tradition were, after all, powers and privileges to be wrested from the state, not from the economy.
Of course socialists had, since the mid-19th century, urged that the economy and the state be merged to guarantee economic rights. But it had become clear by the middle of the 20th century that such merging was disastrous. The history of the pre-1989 "socialist" countries -- bloody dictatorships that paid only lip service to the fraternity for which the socialist revolutionaries had yearned -- made it plausible for conservatives to argue that extending the notion of rights to the economic order would be a step down the road to serfdom. By the end of the 20th century, even left-leaning American intellectuals agreed that "socialism, no wave of the future, now looks (at best) like a temporary historical stage through which various nations passed before reaching the great transition to capitalist democracy."1
The realization by those on the left that a viable economy required free markets did not stop them from insisting that capitalism would be compatible with American ideals of human brotherhood only if the state were able to redistribute wealth. Yet this view was still being criticized as "un-American" and "socialist" at the beginning of the present century, even as, under the pressures of a globalized world economy, the gap between most Americans' incomes and those of the lucky one-third at the top widened. Looking back, we think how easy it would have been for our great-grandfathers to have forestalled the social collapse that resulted from these economic pressures. They could have insisted that all classes had to confront the new global economy together. In the name of our common citizenship, they could have asked everybody, not just the bottom two-thirds, to tighten their belts and make do with less. They might have brought the country together by bringing back its old pride in fraternal ideals.
But as it happened, decades of despair and horror were required to impress Americans with lessons that now seem blindingly obvious.
T he apparent incompatibility of capitalism and democracy is, of course, an old theme in American political and intellectual life. It began to be sounded more than two centuries ago. Historians divide our history into the 100 years before the coming of industrial capitalism and the more than 200 years since. During the first period, the open frontier made it possible for Americans to live in ways that became impossible for their descendants. If you were white in 19th-century America, you always had a second chance: something was always opening up out West.
So the first fault line in American politics was not between the rich and the poor. Instead, it was between those who saw chattel slavery as incompatible with American fraternity and those who did not. (Abolitionist posters showed a kneeling slave asking, "Am I not a man, and a brother?") But only 40 years after the Civil War, reformers were already saying that the problem of chattel slavery had been replaced by that of wage slavery.
The urgency of that problem dominates Herbert Croly's progressivist manifesto of 1909, "The Promise of American Life." Croly argued that the Constitution, and a tradition of tolerant individualism, had kept America hopeful and filled with what he called "genuine good-fellowship" during its first hundred years. But beginning with the first wave of industrialization in the 1870's and 1880's, things began to change. Wage slavery -- a life of misery and toil, without a sense of participation in the national life, and without any trace of the frontiersman's proud independence -- became the fate of more and more Americans. Alexis de Tocqueville had rejoiced that an opulent merchant and his shoemaker, when they met on the streets of Philadelphia in 1840, would exchange political opinions. "These two citizens," he wrote, "are concerned with affairs of state, and they do not part without shaking hands." Croly feared that this kind of unforced fraternity was becoming impossible.
From Croly to John Kenneth Galbraith and Arthur Schlesinger in the 1960's, reformers urged that we needed some form of redistribution to bring back Tocquevillian comity. They battled with conservatives who claimed that redistributive measures would kill economic prosperity. The reformers insisted that what Theodore Roosevelt had called "the money power" and Dwight Eisenhower "the military-industrial complex" was the true enemy of American ideals. The conservatives rejoined that the only enemy of democracy was the state and that the economy must be shielded from do-gooders.
This debate simmered through the first two decades following the Second World War. During that relatively halcyon period, most Americans could get fairly secure, fairly well-paying jobs and could count on their children having a better life than theirs. White America seemed to be making slow but steady progress toward a classless society. Only the growth of the increasingly miserable black underclass reminded white Americans that the promise of American life was still far from being fulfilled.
The sense that this promise was still alive was made possible, in part, by what the first edition of the "Companion" called the "rights revolution." Most of the moral progress that took place in the second half of the 20th century was brought about by the Supreme Court's invocation of constitutional rights, in such decisions as Brown v. Board of Education (1954) and Romer v. Evans (1996), the first Supreme Court decision favorable to homosexuals. But this progress was confined almost entirely to improvements in the situation of groups identified by race, ethnicity or sexuality. The situation of women and of homosexuals changed radically in this period. Indeed, it is now clear that those changes, which spread from America around the world, were the most lasting and significant moral achievements of the 20th century.
But though such groups could use the rhetoric of rights to good effect, the trade unions, the unemployed and those employed at the ludicrously low minimum wage ($174 an hour, in 2095 dollars, compared with the present minimum of $400) could not. Perhaps no difference between pres-
ent-day American political discourse and that of 100 years ago is greater than our assumption that the first duty of the state is to prevent gross economic and social inequality, as opposed to our ancestors' assumption that the government's only moral duty was to insure equal protection of the laws laws that, in their majestic impartiality, allowed the rich and the poor to receive the same hospital bills.
The Supreme Court, invoking this idea of equal protection, began the great moral revival we know as the Civil Rights Movement. The Brown decision initiated both an explosion of violence and an upsurge of fraternal feeling. Some white Americans burned crosses and black churches. Many more had their eyes opened to the humiliations being inflicted on their fellow citizens: if they did not join civil rights marches, they at least felt relieved of guilt when the Court threw out miscegenation laws and when Congress began to protect black voting rights. For a decade or so there was an uplifting sense of moral improvement. For the first time, white and black Americans started to think of each other as fellow citizens.
By the beginning of the 1980's, however, this sense of fraternity was only a faint memory. A burst of selfishness had produced tax revolts in the 70's, stopping in its tracks the fairly steady progress toward a full-fledged welfare state that had been under way since the New Deal. The focus of racial hate was transferred from the rural South to the big cities, where a criminal culture of unemployed (and, in the second generation, virtually unemployable) black youths grew up --
a culture of near constant violence, made possible by the then-famous American "right to bear arms." All the old racial prejudices were revived by white suburbanites' claims that their tax money was being used to coddle criminals. Politicians gained votes by promising to spend what little money could be squeezed from their constituents on prisons rather than on day care.
Tensions between the comfortable middle-class suburbs and the rest of the country grew steadily in the closing decades of the 20th century, as the gap between the educated and well paid and the uneducated and ill paid steadily widened. Class division came into existence between those who made "professional" salaries and those whose hourly wage kept sinking toward the minimum. But the politicians pretended to be unaware of this steady breakdown of fraternity.
Our nation's leaders, in the last decade of the old century and the first of the new, seemed never to have thought that it might be dangerous to make automatic weapons freely and cheaply available to desperate men and women -- people without hope -- living next to the centers of transportation and communication. Those weapons burst into the streets in 2014, in the revolution that, leaving the cities in ruins and dislocating American economic life, plunged the country into the Second Great Depression.
The insurgency in the ghettos, coming at a time when all but the wealthiest Americans felt desperately insecure, led to the collapse of trust in government. The collapse of the economy produced a war of all against all, as gasoline and food became harder and harder to buy, and as even the suburbanites began to brandish guns at their neighbors. As the generals never stopped saying throughout the Dark Years, only the military saved the country from utter chaos.
H ere, in the late 21st century, as talk of fraternity and unselfishness has replaced talk of rights, American political discourse has come to be dominated by quotations from Scripture and literature, rather than from political theorists or social scientists. Fraternity, like friendship, was not a concept that either philosophers or lawyers knew how to handle. They could formulate principles of justice, equality and liberty, and invoke these principles when weighing hard moral or legal issues. But how to formulate a "principle of fraternity"? Fraternity is an inclination of the heart, one that produces a sense of shame at having much when others have little. It is not the sort of thing that anybody can have a theory about or that people can be argued into having.
Perhaps the most vivid description of the American concept of fraternity is found in a passage from John Steinbeck's 1939 novel, "The Grapes of Wrath." Steinbeck describes a desperately impoverished family, dispossessed tenant farmers from Oklahoma, camped out at the edge of Highway 66, sharing their food with an even more desperate migrant family. Steinbeck writes: " 'I have a little food' plus 'I have none.' If from this problem the sum is 'We have a little food,' the movement has direction." As long as people in trouble can sacrifice to help people who are in still worse trouble, Steinbeck insisted, there is fraternity, and therefore social hope.
The movement Steinbeck had in mind was the revolutionary socialism that he, like many other leftists of the 1930's, thought would be required to bring the First Great Depression to an end. "The quality of owning," he wrote, "freezes you forever into the 'I,' and cuts you off forever from the 'we."' Late-20th-century liberals no longer believed in getting rid of private ownership, but they agreed that the promise of American life could be redeemed only as long as Americans were willing to sacrifice for the sake of fellow Americans -- only as long as they could see the government not as stealing their tax money but as needing it to prevent unnecessary suffering.
The Democratic Vistas Party, the coalition of trade unions and churches that toppled the military dictatorship in 2044, has retained control of Congress by successfully convincing the voters that its opponents constitute "the parties of selfishness." The traditional use of "brother" and "sister" in union locals and religious congregations is the principal reason why "fraternity" (or, among purists, "siblinghood") is now the name of our most cherished ideal.
In the first two centuries of American history Jefferson's use of rights had set the tone for political discourse, but now political argument is not about who has the right to what but about what can best prevent the re-emergence of hereditary castes -- either racial or economic. The old union slogan "An injury to one is an injury to all" is now the catch phrase of American politics. "Solidarity Forever" and "This Land Is Your Land" are sung at least as often as "The Star-Spangled Banner."
Until the last 50 years, moral instruction in America had inculcated personal responsibility, and most sermons had focused on individual salvation. Today morality is thought of neither as a matter of applying the moral law nor as the acquisition of virtues but as fellow feeling, the ability to sympathize with the plight of others.
In the churches, the "social gospel" theology of the early 20th century has been rediscovered. Walter Rauschenbusch's "Prayer against the servants of Mammon" ("Behold the servants of Mammon, who defy thee and drain their fellow-men for gain . . . who have made us ashamed of our dear country by their defilements and have turned our holy freedom into a hollow name. . . . ") is familiar to most churchgoers. In the schools, students learn about our country's history from social novels describing our past failures to hang together when we needed to, the novels of Steinbeck, Upton Sinclair, Theodore Dreiser, Richard Wright and, of course, Russell Banks's samizdat novel, "Trampling the Vineyards" (2021).
H istorians unite in calling the 20th the "American" century. Certainly it was in the 20th century that the United States was richest, most powerful, most influential and most self-confident. Our ancestors 100 years ago still thought of the country as destined to police, inform and inspire the world. Compared with the Americans of 100 years ago, we are citizens of an isolationist, unambitious, middle-grade nation.
Our products are only now becoming competitive again in international markets, and Democratic Vistas politicians continue to urge that our consistently low productivity is a small price to pay for union control of the workplace and worker ownership of the majority of firms. We continue to lag behind the European Community, which was able to withstand the pressures of a globalized labor market by having a full-fledged welfare state already in place, and which (except for Austria and Great Britain) was able to resist the temptation to impoverish the most vulnerable in order to keep its suburbanites affluent. Spared the equivalent of our own Dark Years, Europe still, despite all that China can do, holds the position we lost in 2014: it still dominates both the world's economy and its culture.
For two centuries Americans believed that they were as far ahead of Europe, in both virtue and promise, as Europe was ahead of the rest of the world. But American exceptionalism did not survive the Dark Years: we no longer think of ourselves as singled out by divine favor. We are now, once again, a constitutional democracy, but we have proved as vulnerable as Germany, Russia and India to dictatorial takeovers. We have a sense of fragility, of susceptibility to the vicissitudes of time and chance, which Walt Whitman and John Dewey may never have known.
Perhaps no American writer will ever again begin a book, as Croly did, by saying, "The faith of Americans in their own country is religious, if not in its intensity, at any rate in its almost absolute and universal authority." But our chastened mood, our lately learned humility, may have made us better able to realize that everything depends on keeping our fragile sense of American fraternity intact.

HEADLINE: Race I Over

BYLINE: By Stanley Crouch; Stanley Crouch is the author most recently of "The All-American Skin Game: Or, The Decoy of Race."

 BODY:
Even though error, chance and ambition are at the nub of the human future, I am fairly sure that race, as we currently obsess over it, will cease to mean as much 100 years from today. The reasons are basic -- some technological, others cultural. We all know that electronic media have broken down many barriers, that they were even central to the fall of the Soviet Union because satellite dishes made it impossible for the Government to control images and ideas about life outside the country. People there began to realize how far behind they were from the rest of the modern world. The international flow of images and information will continue to make for a greater and greater swirl of influences. It will increasingly change life on the globe and also change our American sense of race.
In our present love of the mutually exclusive, and our pretense that we are something less than a culturally miscegenated people, we forget our tendency to seek out the exotic until it becomes a basic cultural taste, the way pizza or sushi or tacos have become ordinary fare. This approach guarantees that those who live on this soil a century from now will see and accept many, many manifestations of cultural mixings and additions. 
 In that future, definition by racial, ethnic and sexual groups will most probably have ceased to be the foundation of special-interest power. Ten decades up the road, few people will take seriously, accept or submit to any forms of segregation that are marching under the intellectually ragged flag of "diversity." The idea that your background will determine your occupation, taste, romantic preference or any other thing will dissolve in favor of your perceived identity as defined by your class, livelihood and cultural preferences. Americans of the future will find themselves surrounded in every direction by people who are part Asian, part Latin, part African, part European, part American Indian. What such people will look like is beyond my imagination, but the sweep of body types, combinations of facial features, hair textures, eye colors and what are now unexpected skin tones will be far more common, primarily because the current paranoia over mixed marriages should by then be largely a superstition of the past.
In his essay "The Little Man at Chehaw Station," Ralph Ellison described a young "light-skinned, blue-eyed, Afro-American-featured individual who could have been taken for anything from a sun-tinged white Anglo-Saxon, an Egyptian, or a mixed-breed American Indian. . . . " He used the young man as an example of our central problem -- "the challenge of arriving at an adequate definition of American cultural identity. . . . " While the youth's feet and legs were covered by riding boots and breeches, he wore a multicolored dashiki and "a black homburg hat tilted at a jaunty angle." For Ellison, "his clashing of styles nevertheless sounded an integrative, vernacular tone, an American compulsion to improvise upon the given."
The vernacular tone Ellison wrote of is what makes us improvise upon whatever we actually like about one another, no matter how we might pretend we feel about people who are superficially different. Furthermore, the social movements of minorities and women have greatly aided our getting beyond the always culturally inaccurate idea that the United States is "a white man's country."
We sometimes forget how much the Pilgrims learned from the American Indians, or look at those lessons in only the dullest terms of exploitation, not as a fundamental aspect of our American identity. We forget that by the time James Fenimore Cooper was inventing his backwoodsmen, there were white men who had lived so closely to the land and to the American Indian that the white man was, often quite proudly, a cultural mulatto. We forget that we could not have had the cowboy without the Mexican vaquero. We don't know that our most original art-music, jazz, is a combination of African, European and Latin elements. Few people are aware that when the Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung came to this country he observed that white people walked, talked and laughed like Negroes. He also reported that the two dominant figures in the dreams of his white American patients were the Negro and the American Indian.
Are we destined to become one bland nation of interchangeables? I do not think so. What will fall away over the coming decades, I believe, is our present tendency to mistake something borrowed for something ethnically "authentic." Regions will remain regions and within them we will find what we always find: variations on the overall style and pulsation. As the density of cross-influences progresses, we will get far beyond the troubles the Census Bureau now has with racial categories, which are growing because we are so hung up on the barbed wire of tribalism and because we fear absorption, or "assimilation." We look at so-called "assimilation" as some form of oppression, some loss of identity, even a way of "selling out." In certain cases and at certain times, that may have been more than somewhat true. If you didn't speak with a particular command of the language -- or at a subdued volume -- you might have been dismissed as crude. If you hadn't been educated in what were considered the "right places," you were seen as some sort of a peasant.
But anyone who has observed the dressing, speaking and dancing styles of Americans since 1960 can easily recognize the sometimes startling influences that run from the top to the bottom, the bottom to the top. Educated people of whatever ethnic group use slang and terms scooped out from the disciplines of psychology, economics and art criticism. In fact, one of the few interesting things about the rap idiom is that some rappers pull together a much richer vocabulary than has ever existed in black pop music, while peppering it to extremes with repulsive vulgarity.
One hundred years from today, Americans are likely to look back on the ethnic difficulties of our time as quizzically as we look at earlier periods of human history, when misapprehension defined the reality. There will still be squabbling, and those who supposedly speak in the interest of one group or another will hector the gullible into some kind of self-obsession that will influence the local and national dialogues. But those squabbles are basic to upward mobility and competition. It is the very nature of upward mobility and competition to ease away superficial distinctions in the interest of getting the job done. We already see this in the integration of the workplace, in the rise of women and in the increase of corporations that grant spousal-equivalent benefits to homosexuals because they want to keep their best workers, no matter what they do privately as consenting adults. In the march of the world economy, the imbalances that result from hysterical xenophobia will largely melt away because Americans will be far too busy standing up to the challenges of getting as many international customers for their wares as they can. That is, if they're lucky.

Bulletin From the Future

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
Emergency supplies of pencils are being distributed at all computer clinics by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency warns that the epidemic is spreading on all continents, clogging channels of communication, including live links to human nervous systems.
The tedious but easily learned technol-ogy of pencil writing is recommended for all transactions that may be needed for future reference. If properly sorted in handmade files or boxes, penciled records will be scannable into memories, mechanical or human, once the virus has been isolated and destroyed. 
 Officials are unable to predict how soon the epidemic can be contained. They still urge logging off all networks, wired or wireless, and restoring to working order old radio and television receivers, telephones, faxes and photocopiers in private hands to facilitate the distribution of further advisories.
 
The Viral Effects
The menacing virus, an unfamiliar strain, appears to have incapacitated key links in the Universal Network and destroyed financial records across the earth. It has confounded or frozen personal compufones. It has also
infected the brain cells of individuals who have implanted chips for freehand surfing. Their illness does not appear to be life-threatening but leaves them temporarily unable to interact with other people and telepathic devices.
The most severe damage is predicted for the most advanced societies, exceeding the injury suffered in past centuries during great floods, earthquakes and urban fires. Although magnacomputers can normally detect and destroy most viruses, they failed to recognize the new strain and allowed it to routinely infect backup systems.
The United States stands to lose nearly a century's records. For the foreseeable future, Americans will certainly lack any capacity to receive and deliver banking and financial services, including salaries and pensions, educational texts and tests, medical records and all other transmissions dependent on recorded history. Some essential data may take decades to find or recreate.
After organizing relief efforts, officials promise a worldwide search for the origin of the virus. Epidemiologists have not ruled out a "natural" infection of the kind that caused the Market Panic of '29 and the calamitous two-month delay in tallying America's home-cast votes for President during the Glitch of '76. They vow to punish the saboteurs if, as many suspect, the virus turns out to be a human creation.
Some suspicion has fallen on the compuliterate elites of the Asian subcontinent, whose communities complain that they have failed to benefit from membership in UniNet and that their most gifted hackers are being exploited as file drones by American, Japanese and European megacorps. Leading American politicians have also revived demands for better controls over "netbacks," the growing number of illegal migrants onto the UniNet who have not been certified for information labor.
The virulence of the new virus, however, also suggests the possibility of state-sponsored terrorism. Any number of disaffected political movements are deemed capable of viral sabotage. The most frequently mentioned suspects are the "neutralists" who refused to honor the disclosure rules of the UniWorld Banking Act and were finally expelled three years ago from the Universal Economic Union. Even if they are ultimately cleared of suspicion, the present crisis seems certain to revive demands to make UniNet truly universal,
by force or sanctions if necessary.
 
Severity of the Crisis
The current crisis is viewed as being vastly more serious than the Language Rebellion of '48, which only damaged machines and caused relatively minor economic dislocations. The French-led rebellion was put down in just 10 days, when even French-speaking Africans refused to endorse a computer boycott and joined in rejecting demands for bilingual construction of UniNet programs.
It was the treaty ending the language crisis that gave UniNet its almost global dimension. The treaty was ratified by Unipoll, the first worldwide opinion canvas and prototype of the referendums now used routinely to confirm or veto government decisions. As predicted at the time, nearly all computer-literate people became fluent in Unispeak within two dec-ades and have felt no disadvantage in business dealings with formerly English-speaking people.
 
Strategies for Coping
Until further notice, mo-demized communication should be avoided altogether. Wherever possible, business affairs, personal messages and shopping orders should be conveyed over preNet wires and cables. Even face-to-face deal-ings with mentally logged individuals could be hazardous, since they cannot deprogram themselves without professional help. Until cleared, they are required to wear quarantine scarves.
Because warehouses can rapidly recreate inventories on virgin computers, they will soon begin to fill shopping orders delivered by substitute technologies. For the duration of the crisis, handwritten requests will not be subject to the normal surcharges, nor will penalties be imposed on transactions financed by personal checks or plastic, paper and metal money.
Rocket Express, which lost three cargo orbiters in the first hours of the viral collapse, has suspended operations, as has Drone Air. But weather permitting, piloted aircraft will run on limited schedules.
Home systems that can disconnect from UniNet may use customized local programs to manage temperature, security, illumination and recycling systems.
Personal netmobiles that can generate their own power may continue to
operate unlinked, employing manual controls to adjust speeds to road and traffic conditions. Linkway guidance beams, roadlocks and automaps have been deactivated. The USA Times-Journal is arranging to print and distribute one-state maps.
The USA Times-Journal will also publish limited paper bulletins containing Government advisories and other crisis news, but without its customary interactive features, games and advertisements. The company is reopening printing plants that were finally mothballed a decade ago when the last subscribers switched to compufones that receive customized Selectoprint editions of the former newspaper. Paper stocks are believed adequate for a month.
The New York Public Conservatory of Books, although disconnected from UniNet, has offered to copy and, where possible, fax excerpts from original volumes. It will honor high priority requests from Government agencies and courts engaged in legal research, from schools and universities improvising emergency texts and from technicians needing manuals to activate obsolete equipment and communications.
The Centers for Disease Control is working urgently to develop an effective vaccine that will repel the guilty virus and permit at least limited resumption of computer management and an early restoration of public services. Officials warn, however, that the loss of trust in the current epidemic is likely to leave governments dissatisfied with scientific remedies.
Some nations may now secede from UniNet, causing additional confusion and dislocation. Some may revive proposals for SafetiNets, the oft-rejected idea of creating separate national networks maintained under national surveillance to screen and cleanse all traffic in and out of UniNet. Still others contend that the inevitable delays and traffic jams of SafetiNets would negate the benefits of virtually cost-free global communication. They prefer government archives for the storage of periodically delinked memory capsules.
Pencil stocks will be exhausted in about a week. Officials are negotiating to subsidize manual production with the heirs of the Qin Corporation in Xian, the Eberhard Fabers in Seattle, Caran d'Ache of Zurich and Karandash of Kiev. Their brands dominate the emergency stores created a decade ago, after environmentalists succeeded in outlawing pens and other ink-based technologies. The preferred crisis pencil is black, No. 2.

HEADLINE: The Capitalist;
Future Stock

BYLINE: By Michael Lewis 

 BODY:
I assume that the year 2096 will look nothing as it does in the movies; the planet will not be a desert teeming with ugly men with warts on their faces who chase after Mel Gibson in go-carts. I assume also that both capitalism and democracy will spread, and that investments will return profits and losses to capitalists in much the same way as they do today. I assume, finally, that the reader knows that I know how deeply dislikable people are who go around telling other people what is going to happen in the stock market 100 years from now, mainly because there is no loss in being wrong and no gain in being right. If 100 years ago some Wall Street stock jobber had picked up the Dow Jones industrial average (which first appeared on May 26, 1896) and insisted that the Dow's biggest sector -- farming -- would, in 1996, give way to aerospace, retail and oil and chemicals companies, he would have been thought an idle speculator. In the markets, as in life, the very long term is irrelevant.
There will be two important differences from today in the typical portfolio of 2096, as I see it. The first is that it will be much quieter: flipping manically in and out of stocks, as millions of Americans habitually do now, will be widely regarded as an act of lunacy. For the past 20 years, studies have been showing that it does not pay an investor to take financial advice either directly from brokers or indirectly from mutual-fund managers -- that once he has made the broad decision of what percentage of his assets to invest in the stock market, he is better off putting the money in a stock-market index. Brokerage houses and mutual funds are the railroads of the future; Merrill Lynch and Fidelity will go the way of the Reading and Penn Central. 
 The second big difference will be the currency in which the indexed portfolio is held. Since the collapse of the Bretton Woods agreement, which enforced the gold standard from the end of World War II to the Nixon era, the world has lived on the dollar standard. The dollar standard depends on foreigners' willingness to hold ever-larger amounts of dollars. (As of Sept. 1, for instance, the Bank of Japan had a bit more than $214 billion in reserve.) Confidence in the dollar remains at an all-time high. But if there is one rule of monetary systems, it is that they eventually perish, especially when they make no sense.
The natural replacement of the dollar is a single world currency administered by a global investment bank. This is merely an extension of trends under way: developed countries already coordinate their money supplies. Soon, enough European countries will give up power over their own currencies and adopt the Euro. From the Euro, it is but a small step to the Globo.
 
So far, so clear. There is but one question remaining: What will constitute the index in which investors sink their Globos? Since the stock market is merely a reflection of the society's profit-seeking behavior, it is impossible to predict what the market will look like without also predicting what the world will look like. Over the next 100 years, market forces will work their inexorable magic, which is to say that those who have money to spend will get whatever they want. Thus the big question is: What will people want? A few guesses:
 
Home Entertainment. The growing hunger for diversion at home is a consequence of the declining appeal of places outside
of the home. Travel, for instance, will have lost all of its allure. All the things that make travel unpleasant today will, a hundred years from now, conspire to make it unbearable. The fantastic crowds, for a start. (Ten billion people on the planet, and you think you're going to get even a glimpse of the Mona Lisa?) Much of the novelty will be drained of foreign places, as the world becomes fully homogenized -- or rather that part of the world in which you will
be able to travel without risking your life. Everyone will speak English, which sounds pleasant until it happens. The late 19th and early 20th centuries will be looked back upon as the golden age of travel, as impossible to recreate as the belief in God. There will be widespread nostalgia for the time when it was humiliating for an American to order a drink in Paris.
The market will respond by producing ever-more-sophisticated ways for people to divert themselves without leaving home. The world's largest corporation will be Walt Disney Industries. People will no longer visit foreign places; foreign places will visit people, in the form of Disney's Multisensory Package Tours. These tours will enable
you to visit not merely other places but also other times. Disney's most popular product will enable the
consumer to star in his own fictions -- movies, music videos, novels, etc. All the most popular fictions will be set in the distant past. The future will have lost all its glamour, as it will be impossible to imagine it as anything but more of the present. "The Kugelmass Episode" -- Woody Allen's short story about a Brooklyn man who, seeking to slake his midlife crisis, is thrust into the text of "Madame Bovary" -- will have become reality.

Home Furnishings. With even the very rich confined to private living spaces, the market will give birth to many ingenious ideas about how to inhabit that space. The human craving for invidious distinction will be satisfied neither by foreign travel nor by proximity to celebrity but by various domestic gewgaws and trinkets of which we cannot even begin to conceive. Interior design will acquire the prestige of monumental sculpture in 16th-century Rome or movie making
in 20th-century America. The late-1980's phenomenon of the big-shot investment banker with his "interior decorator" wife will give way to the late-2080's phenomenon of the big-shot interior decorator with her "investment banker" husband.

Personal Security. Following a brief bubble in prison stocks in the mid-2020's, there will come into existence a new technology that enables society to guard criminals without building walls around them. Sensors implanted in various parts of a man's body will react to chemicals in his brain and deliver unpleasant shocks when he approaches others with criminal intent. One big political issue of the 2090's will be government expenditures on punitive implants. Since the government is buying, the companies doing the business will make out big time.

Water Companies. Economics courses on utility theory often begin with
the famous water-diamond paradox: if water is essential and diamonds are not, why do diamonds cost more than water? But the paradox looks to be resolving itself, albeit slowly. My favorite Wall Street newsletter, Grant's Interest Rate Observer, recently pointed out that in the United States a gallon of bottled water costs more than a gallon of gasoline. Look for this trend to continue.
 
Pharmaceuticals. Population growth means a growth in diseases that prey on people. By 2096, viruses will be the biggest health risk. (Epidemiology will be the most lucrative branch of medicine.) The market will respond to the boom in viruses with a corresponding boom in cures. The tension and drama of 100 simultaneous races for cures will lend spurious meaning to human life. Survivors of strange diseases will be the most interesting people on the planet. A poetry of the invisible will come into being: man who conquered all things large is succumbing to all things small -- that sort of thing.
The pharmaceutical companies will use their swelling profits to overrun markets that in the mid-21st century still belonged to cosmetic companies. People in Los Angeles will continue to purchase their sex appeal. But it will require a prescription.

The biggest challenge for the market will be to meet the demand for meaning in life. Darwinism will spread; God will vanish. Entertainment technology will debase celebrity -- fame, like everything else, will have been democratized -- so that people will no longer be able to live through their idols. The possibility of being struck down by a virus will bring a good deal of happiness to those who survive. But even the spread of disease will prove insufficient to make life worth living. Man will increasingly be thrown back on his self to justify his existence.
From a distance of 100 years, therapy stocks are looking pretty cheap.

A New Incentive for Upstairs Housing Downtown

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
A $10-MILLION state program could help bring back housing over downtown stores, space that over the last four decades or so has been replaced by warehouse or office uses.
In the process, the program's supporters say, it could rejuvenate central business districts that in recent years have struggled against a sputtering economy and competition from regional malls. 
 There is a national trend to restore downtowns to their roots as "centers of commerce, government and housing," said Richard K. Bradley, president of the International Downtown Association, a nonprofit group in Washington that promotes the recovery of business districts. Incentive programs like New Jersey's help reclaim those uses, he said.
Under the state's program, borrowers can obtain below-market-rate loans to renovate buildings they are buying or refinancing. In turn, they must create or improve residences on the upper floors. There are no income or purchase price limits, but there are renovation requirements and maximum mortgage amounts.
Upstairs Downtown, as the program is called, was started eight months ago as a demonstration project by the New Jersey Mortgage Housing and Finance Agency. It is also part of the state's $700 million housing plan initiated in 1995 to increase the production of low- and moderate-income housing.
The state agency, using money from its administrative fund, offers the mortgages, which are guaranteed by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development's Mortgage Insurance Program. The focus of that program is to renovate residential properties.
But New Jersey secured a waiver to apply the Federal loan guarantee to mixed-use buildings, said Timothy J. Touhey, executive director of the quasipublic state mortgage agency. He said the waiver was the first in the nation.
Borrowers can obtain through nine participating lenders 30-year fixed-rate loans for up to $292,800 at the identical rate of the 10-year Treasury note, now at 6.9 percent. They must agree to make improvements equal to at least 15 percent of the estimated value of the property after renovations.
A 30-year loan at 2.5 percentage points above the 10-year Treasury note is also available if a property owner needs more money than the maximum mortgage amount permitted for that location. This option includes an interest-free second mortgage of 10 percent of the total cost, which is forgiven after 145 payments. "Total cost" is described as purchase price plus rehabilitation costs less the down payment.
For a property owner to secure a loan, a one-story building must ultimately have no more than 25 percent of commercial space; a two-story building, 49 percent, and a three-story building, 33 percent and there must be one to four apartments.
What Upstairs Downtown does, said Mr. Touhey, is provide a construction and permanent loan rolled into one. He noted that such financing was not readily available by the private sector to such borrowers, who now must obtain separate loans.
"This is a program to produce more housing," he added. "But it also creates an economic development tool for downtowns."
That intent is sound because "the future of downtowns lies in having a mix of uses," said Donald R. Smartt, president of The Community Advocate, a Verona-based consulting firm that helps communities improve their downtowns. But, he said, to achieve that mix and take full advantage of the program there "has to be a rethinking of the zoning for downtowns," which often restricts housing.
While most bankers and downtown and housing advocates say the program provides needed funds, they discern some warts. One, they say, is that it has limited applicability due to the mortgage cap and a complicated processing procedure, the latter an issue the state hopes to streamline.
"Yes, it is a difficult program, but with cooperation among borrowers, sellers, realtors and lenders it can work," said H. Eugene Brown, president of Pioneer Mortgage in Haddon Heights, a lender in the program. For borrowers there are some substantial savings, he said.
So far $4 million in loans have been committed to owners of 30 buildings and seven loans have closed. Mr. Touhey said 125 loans were expected to be made, with up to 190 residences created. "We are also looking to expand the program, at least doubling it," he said.
AMONG the borrowers are Linda and Lawrence Carnuccio, who refinanced their three-story building on Asbury Avenue, a main commercial street in the resort community of Ocean City. The building has two apartments over a store, which until recently had been vacant.
"We thought about refinancing for three years, but held off because interest rates were high and loans were not readily available for commercial properties, especially one with an empty store," said Mrs. Carnuccio. "The low rate and long term offered under this program prompted us to do it now."
She said the $150,000 loan was used to, among other things, refurbish the facade and retail space, now leased to a coffeehouse. The apartments, which are rented, are being upgraded.
"We now have a successful business downstairs and the ability to keep our residential tenants above," she said.
Ocean City has welcomed the program as another tool in its efforts to keep the downtown strong year-round. "Our downtown still has a viable residential component and the state program allows landlords to improve their properties and help retain tenants," said Dennis R. Campbell, the city's economic development coordinator. He is also executive director of Business And Neighborhood Development, a group of business owners working to promote the downtown.
Other communities also saye the program helps their downtown renewal efforts. In recent years, most of the vacancies in the 351 stores in Red Bank's 15-block downtown have been filled. But the borough is looking forward to using the Upstairs Downtown program to help fill the many vacancies that still exist on the upper floors.
"We are looking to attract residences and make the downtown more livable" said Marta Person, the Borough Administrator. To that end Red Bank recently revised its master plan to permit housing over stores, she said.
Several property owners have applied or hope to apply for state loans. Among them is Anthony P. Busch, a principal of the local Precise Construction, which is converting its 130,000-square-foot garage on West Front Street into an antique gallery with three second-floor apartments. Mr. Busch said he hoped to fit the project to the program because it would "lower our debt and make the apartments more marketable."
Rahway, which has a 10-block downtown with 170 shops, is also revising its master plan to allow housing over stores. "It will help provide that 24-hour presence of people living, working and shopping in the downtown," said Frank Regan, the city's director of Building, Planning and Economic Development.
There are now 260 residences downtown. But by converting floors above the stores and adding levels to buildings 150 more apartments can be created, said Mr. Regan, noting that several property owners were interested in doing just that. In the past, he said, financing such mixed-use projects was a problem. Now, he said, the state program can help.
The maximum mortgage amounts offered through the program vary, depending on where the property is situated and the number of housing units it contains. For buildings with one residence it ranges from $99,250 to $152,362; for those with four units, it ranges from $156,700 to $292,800.
This is the way a loan would work for the hypothetical borrower. If the estimated value of the property after improvements is $100,000, the property owner would have to make at least $15,000 in improvements. Thus the original value would have had to have been $85,000. The money to make the improvements would be rolled into the mortgage.
Down payment can be as low as 3 percent for an owner who lives on the property; it is 15 percent for investors.
"The program is attractive," said Mr. Brown, of Pioneer Mortgage, "because under normal circumstances these improvements would not happen."
William Miller, who received a $103,000 state loan to buy and renovate a three-story building in Penns Grove, agreed. The building has a deli with three apartments above and Mr. Miller plans to add a fourth. "Without this program," he said, "I couldn't afford to buy and fix up this property."

HEADLINE: Living With A Radium Nightmare

BYLINE: By DEBBIE GALANT 

DATELINE: GLEN RIDGE

 BODY:
WHEN Eldon and Betty Allin decided to move into a four-bedroom Colonial on Carteret Street in 1961, her father warned against it. "Don't buy it," he told them. "It's built on a dump." He knew because he worked at Public Service Electric and Gas, and had installed all the original gas meters on the block. The Allins bought the house anyway.
They didn't discover how right he was until 22 years later. Then one evening, on vacation in Florida, they saw their street on television. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency had just announced that an extensive area of radium contamination had been found in Essex County. The Allins, and their neighbors, were living atop radium waste discarded more than half a century earlier from a nearby watch-dial factory. The dirt in their yard was radioactive, with a half-life of 1,600 years. 
 The discovery changed their lives. In time, they would be moved out of their house until their lawn could be torn up, excavated and replaced. They would have to collect and send in regular air samples from their basement. They would get used to the men in anti-contamination gear, the hazardous material warnings, the regular letters from E.P.A. And they would learn more than anybody really wants to know about Superfund, the Federal program for cleaning up toxic waste disasters.
They never moved from Carteret Street, nor were they ever quite convinced that the soil posed any real danger. "I asked: Prove to me, show me the records, show me that people have become ill from this," Mr. Allin said.
But recently Mrs. Allin has been collecting names of people in the neighborhood who have died of lung cancer, the main health risk linked to such contamination. So far she has found four, but she wonders about neighbors who moved away. She has developed lymphoma herself, and she wonders if there is a connection. (A 1988 epidemiological survey by the state did find increased lung cancer rates in the area but noted that the sample size was small.)
And there are small things about living on a Superfund site that you never get used to. All day long, huge trucks filled with 20 tons of radioactive dirt from Carteret Park rumble by, rattling Mrs. Allin's china and making cracks in her walls. "There's constantly dirt," she said. "Worse than the digging is the backwards beep."
When the story of Love Canal broke in the late 1970's, Americans discovered a dark side of having the world's most successful industrial economy. Congress responded to the proliferation of abandoned toxic dumps by passing the Superfund law in 1980; it requires those responsible for toxic wastes to clean them up and, where the polluter can't be found or made to pay, cleans up those sites using fees collected from certain heavy industries. "Superfund is a program that is dealing with the sins of the past," said John Frisco of the E.P.A., who has been responsible for the agency's toxic cleanup effort in New Jersey for the past seven years.
As far as past sins go, few states have more to atone for than New Jersey. There are 116 Superfund sites here, more than any other state. "Industry started here," Mr. Frisco explained. "Wastes were handled improperly by today's standards." Industrial horrors in New Jersey include thorium contamination from the manufacture of gas lamps in Maywood, an asbestos dump in Millington and mercury contamination from the manufacture of vapor lamps in Hoboken.
A Superfund site is seldom hard to recognize: go to a place where hazardous materials were carelessly produced or stored or dumped, and there you are. But in Glen Ridge, you could spend all day walking around the 90-acre site -- this utterly typical neighborhood of 1930's houses on shady streets, of flower gardens and jungle gyms and dogs -- and never guess the source of the contamination.
Half a mile away, in Orange, is the abandoned factory where the U.S. Radium Corporation made luminous watch dials from 1915 to 1926. At the time, nobody knew radium was dangerous; it was only after women who worked at the factory began getting sick and dying of cancer that the Essex County medical examiner, Dr. Harrison A. Martland, spotted the connection.
By that time, soil tainted with radioactive tailings from the factory had been used to fill in low-lying areas of Essex County -- a total of 210 acres in Glen Ridge, Montclair and West Orange. It was not until 1981 that the E.P.A. -- as part of a national initiative -- conducted an aerial survey of the 12 square miles around the U.S. Radium plant. Ground surveys over the next two years confirmed the presence of dangerous gamma radiation, and the problem was first revealed publicly at the end of 1983.
A byproduct of decaying radium is radon, a gas that is not dangerous in the open but can lead to lung cancer if it is concentrated inside a house. When the problem was first detected, radon levels in some houses were 100 times the safe level. Within days of announcing the problem, the E.P.A. began installing lead shields and ventilation systems in the most contaminated homes.
After 13 years and the expenditure of $120 million, 300 houses in the three towns have been fully cleaned of radium, and 80,000 cubic yards of tainted soil -- 5,000 large truckloads -- have been sent to a disposal site in Utah. In the second major phase of the cleanup project, the Government is now removing 65,000 cubic yards of dirt from Carteret Park, which normally has two ball fields and a small playground. In the third and final phase, the Government will remove radium contamination under the streets. It expects to be finished by 2000.
WHEN the Allins saw their street on TV in 1983, it was big news. But the news cameras move on to fresh disasters. The Superfund site in Glen Ridge hasn't generated much in the way of newspaper headlines for a number of years, but the effects of gamma rays on a town go on and on.
Steve and Anne Sutton live with their 18-month-old triplets in a small but unusually cheerful house on Midland Avenue, around the corner from Carteret Park. The place looks a little like Pee Wee's Playhouse, with a giant alphabet puzzle serving as the living room rug, a sofa upholstered in denim, lavender trim on the porch.
When the Suttons decided to buy a house in Glen Ridge in 1993 -- 10 years after the radium problem was first publicly identified -- it was a buyer's market. The house on Midland was just one of many that would have done. Because it was a handyman's special, they bid $17,000 under the asking price. But when the seller immediately accepted their bid, they were vaguely troubled. Perhaps they might have got the house for even less.
Even though they had been living in Montclair, the Suttons had no idea that Glen Ridge was involved too; at the time, no houses nearby were being cleaned up. They were worried about radiators that didn't work. A radioactive lawn was the furthest thing from their minds.
An hour after the closing, looking around their new house, the Suttons discovered a box of warranties and tax bills the seller had left them. And there, in the box, was a letter from the E.P.A. Suddenly they understood why they got such a great price on the house. They tried to see if they could stop the deal, but it was too late. The lawyers were all gone and the seller was driving to Arizona. "With our check," Mrs. Sutton added. "Needless to say, we did not crack open that bottle of Champagne."
The Suttons were hardly the only unwitting buyers in Glen Ridge. The same thing happened to Carl Bergmanson and his wife, Ruby Siegel, who was seven months pregnant when they moved to Lorraine Street in 1988. They found out about the radium the following spring.
"We got a notice in the mail from the E.P.A. about a meeting," said Mr. Bergmanson. "It said something like, 'As you know, you are part of a Superfund site radium cleanup . . . .' And we were like, 'What the heck is this?' "
Getting unexpected news about living on toxic waste has a way of making people feel foolish, of making all the little precautions one takes in the course of life seem ultimately futile. For Mr. Bergmanson, the discovery made a mockery of all the effort his wife had put into having a safe pregnancy.
"She didn't dye her hair. She didn't drink. She was very good about it," he said. "And to find out that she spent the last two months of her pregnancy in a radium-contaminated backyard was like ha-ha-ha."
It turned out the contamination was in Mr. Bergmanson's backyard. He got a map from the E.P.A., measured his property carefully and built a fence to prevent his son, Andrew, or anybody else from wandering into the toxic area. There was one three-foot stretch left, just enough to put in a sandbox. That was all of the back yard the Bergmansons got to use for the next five and a half years.
Asked whether he sued the seller or the realtor who sold him his house on Lorraine Street, Mr. Bergmanson chooses his words carefully. "The matter has been resolved," he says. "That's all I've been permitted to say."
The Superfund site generated a great deal of litigation. In 1991, after a seven-year legal battle that went all the way to the State Supreme Court, 237 residents of Glen Ridge, Montclair and West Orange collected $4.2 million, an average of $18,000 per house, from the remnants of the U.S. Radium Corporation. The terms of the settlement were kept confidential.
Mr. Bergmanson, who is now president of the Town Council in Glen Ridge, is a friendly, community-spirited fellow, the kind of guy who shovels his elderly neighbor's walk when it snows. But on this issue he allows himself real rancor.
"I felt betrayed by any system that would allow people to purchase a home that was contaminated with radium," he said. "Categorically and undeniably, we would never in a million years have bought this house, even if it was half the price."
OF course, one man's poison is another man's bargain. Nobody knows this better than Lynne Oliver, a real estate agent with Prudential Zinn Associates, who lives about half a mile from Carteret Street and who sells about 10 of the 100 or so houses that turn over in Glen Ridge each year. Selling houses on a Superfund site is, admittedly, a challenge. But then, real estate is full of location challenges.
Mrs. Oliver believes that one part of her job is to making sure there's appropriate disclosure, and another part is putting this information in perspective. "People say: 'Oh, my God. It's a radon cleanup site.' I say: 'Hold on. It's not Love Canal.' "
True, living in a Superfund site does bring down the value of your property. And yet, for some buyers, it's just that discount that allows them to buy the house, or the town, they want. Mrs. Oliver is proud of a thank-you note from a couple who bought a house in the nearby Montclair site, after they were assured that a Government-installed ventilation system would protect them. "Our American dream could not come true without your help," they wrote her.
The first phase of the Superfund project in Glen Ridge is just about over. Nearly all the radium under and around houses is gone. But the second phase has just begun. For two more years, Carteret Park will be filled with the roaring and grinding of backhoes. A huge pile of dirt waiting to be bagged can be seen from the front porches on Carteret Street. Forty trucks a day will be hauling bags of dirt out of the park. Completing the scene is a small throng of picketers that shows up daily, protesting the contractor's use of nonunion labor.
And then, of course, there's the huge Superfund sign that the contractor recently put up at the entrance of the construction site. As if realtors didn't have enough challenges. "We all laughed," said Mrs. Oliver. "It wasn't bad enough that it was ugly. Now there's a huge sign that says Superfund."
"For the time being, it's going to depress values," she admitted. But real estate is a long-term proposition, and you don't get very far in this business unless you're an optimist. "Once it's over," she said confidently, "it will be nicer than ever."
KIT SCHACKNER seems an unlikely choice to lead an environmental crusade. As she sits in her living room discussing Superfund, she lights one cigarette after another. She tells the story of how she moved, knowingly, into a house with radium contamination -- having been assured that the Government planned to clean it up -- and waited patiently for the cleanup to begin.
That was in 1987. But for a year and a half, nothing happened. No communications from the E.P.A., no bulldozers, nothing. And strangely, no one else seemed concerned. When Ms. Schackner tried to get information from neighbors, she discovered that she had stumbled into a powerful taboo. "It was like asking, Do you have cancer? Is your son gay?" she said. She started attending Town Council meetings. The subject of radium never came up.
Finally, in the spring of 1989, the E.P.A. held a public meeting to announce its plan. Kit Schackner went. So did Carl Bergmanson, with his baby son, Andrew.
A 27-page report listed all the alternatives the E.P.A. had considered. One plan was to take all the contaminated soil from the district, pile it in Carteret Park, seal it off and create a permanent hazardous-waste zone. Another alternative was to do nothing.
Then the agency revealed its actual plan. The houses with the most contamination would be fully cleaned up. But for homes where the radium contamination was not as severe, or where hot spots were outside the house, there would only be a partial cleanup. "Engineering controls" would be erected as a barrier between radium and people. "Institutional controls" -- possibly in the form of deed restrictions on the property -- would be used to make sure those barriers stayed in place.
Ms. Schackner was not reassured. "I felt like a giant bureaucratic steamroller was coming down," she said, "and we were going to be buried in radium."
Mrs. Schackner had never met Mr. Bergmanson before, but when he spoke up at the meeting, she took down his name. The next night, she rode her bike over to his house on Lorraine Street. Within a month, the Lorraine Street Committee for a Radium-Free Glen Ridge was born.
The committee got the E.P.A. to extend its deadline for commenting on the plan. Mrs. Schackner's husband, Kelly Conklin, began making calls to Washington, developing political allies like the future Governor James J. Florio -- then a Congressman and Superfund's prime sponsor -- and Senator Frank R. Lautenberg. The committee organized a townwide mailing, urging neighbors to write to Congress. Mr. Lautenberg arranged a pivotal meeting between the activists and the head of Superfund in Washington.
In the end, the E.P.A. agreed to a complete cleanup -- "remediation," in the bureaucratic jargon. All the radium would go. "In terms of public outcry, it was one of the most dramatic that I've experienced in my career," Mr. Frisco said.
THERE are those who wonder whether the money was worth it. Even people like Mrs. Sutton, the mother of triplets. "Certain people in the neighborhood have said that they wish they'd never found it and just left it alone," she said. "To be honest with you, I'm not sure there is a big deal."
Certainly, reasonable people can disagree about whether the presence of an invisible contaminant really constitutes a peril. When the radium was discovered, the Allins decided to live with it. Stanley Jackson, who lived down the block with his wife and two young daughters, sold his home as fast as he could. "It took us a year," Mr. Jackson said. "We felt trapped. Every time one of those kids coughed -- to this day -- we still worry."
Charles Powers, professor of environmental and community medicine at the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute in Piscataway, points out that the nation has 300,000 to 400,000 sites where there may be major hazardous-waste contamination. Of those, only 1,200 have made the Superfund priority list. And only a few have benefited from the kind of full-scale cleanup that Glen Ridge got.
"We're not going to be able to move every single molecule of everything we're worried about," Dr. Powers said.
Even Mr. Conklin, who spent so much time taking his community's case to Washington, sometimes worries that the program favors those who know how to use the political system to their advantage. "It's one of the troubling facts of Superfund when communities like ours get cleaned up and poor ones don't," he said.
But then it is hard to imagine what might have happened here without a Superfund, without grass-roots activism, without some help from friends in high places. It is hard to imagine what would have happened if the Federal Government had decided not to clean up all the houses surrounding Carteret Park, but condemned the property instead.
"The other option was simply tear the houses down and put fences in the area and create 100 little radon parks," said Edward M. Callahan Jr., who was Mayor of Glen Ridge while all the decisions were being made. "That would have been an outrage. That would have contaminated the entire community."
 
A Costly, Painful Loss of Innocence
Radium was discovered by Marie Curie in 1898, and for nearly three decades nobody knew it was dangerous. Here are some key dates in the history of that ignorance and its consequences in Essex County.
 
1915-26 U.S. Radium Corporation makes luminous watch dials at its factory in Orange.
 
1920's Women from U.S. Radium begin developing mysterious and often fatal illnesses. In 1925 the county medical examiner links the ailments to the radium paint in which they dipped their brushes.
 
1920's AND 30's Waste from U.S. Radium is used as landfill in low-lying areas of Glen Ridge, Montclair and West Orange. Houses are built on top of the fill.
 
1980 Congress passes the Superfund law.
 
1981 A Federal aerial survey spots excess gamma radiation in the three towns.
 
1983 E.P.A. confirms the presence of radioactive soil with ground surveys. Within days, it begins installing temporary ventilation systems and lead shields in homes with the greatest contamination.
 
1985 The Essex County radium-contamination site is added to the Superfund priority list. A pilot program by the State Department of Environmental Protection to clean up 12 residential properties is stopped when Nevada refuses to accept radium waste.
 
1989 E.P.A. proposes partial cleanup of the Superfund site for $53 million. The Lorraine Street Committee for a Radium-Free Glen Ridge begins a grass-roots campaign.
 
1990 E.P.A. agrees to remove all radium.
 
1991 Cleanup begins.
 
1996 Radium has been removed from 300 properties.
 
1998 Cleanup of Carteret Park in Glen Ridge is scheduled to end; excavation of streets is to begin.
 
2000 Entire project is expected to be finished. Total cost: $150 million.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Jamaica;
Plans Advance for Office Complex in Jamaica

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
MAYBE this time it will actually happen. Twice before, developers have been selected for a two-acre city-owned site in central Jamaica, Queens, and twice the project, which has its roots in the Lindsay administration, has failed to go forward.
Now the Mattone Group, itself based in Queens, has been conditionally selected as the developer of an $80 million office-retail-entertainment complex on a long-vacant site on top of the Parsons/Archer Avenue subway station in the old downtown shopping area in the southeast part of the borough. 
 Significantly, anchor tenants for the project have been identified, with Sony Theaters prepared to put in a Magic Johnson 11- or 12-screen first-run movie house in an area that has been without a movie house for many years.
In addition, the Catholic Medical Center, which operates five hospitals in the city, has agreed to take space in the office tower that would rise over two floors of retail stores and the third floor, where the film screens would be situated.
The project would be the first major, mostly private, investment in this part of Queens in over two decades. Joseph M. Mattone Sr., the president of the Mattone Group, said the recognition that there is an underserved middle-class market in this part of the city is what may make the current effort successful.
"This is an urban renewal project that goes back at least 25 years," he said. "The problem in the past was a lack of tenant response to developers' efforts."
But, he said, there are 350,000 people living in the area, who now drive to other areas of the city -- or, more commonly, to the suburbs -- to shop and for entertainment. "And it is a middle-class community," he said, "with family incomes of $45,000 to $60,000 a year."
The deal could still fall apart. Mr. Mattone said it would be essential to lure national-brand retailers, like the Gap, the Limited, and Old Navy to the project to recapture shoppers who now go to regional malls like Roosevelt Field and Green Acres in Nassau County.
The developer has to reach an agreement to lease or purchase the site from the city. And the amount of subsidized parking remains unresolved.
Nevertheless the Jamaica project appears to reflect the Giuliani Administration's interest in economic development and determination to push long-stalled projects to completion. "With the financial backing of Sony, we have a high level of confidence that this will get done," said Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
He said the city is putting pressure on developers and their financial backers to start moving ahead or risk losing their designations. "We are saying to developers that it is time to put up or shut up," he added. "We want to create incentives to get these things finished." He cited the case of the Renaissance Plaza office-hotel project in Brooklyn that is now being excavated after 13 years of delays.
Mr. Millard also noted that many investors had avoided areas with a heavy minority population, like southeast Queens, in the past despite data on rising income levels.
THE Queens project is described as "a huge victory" by F. Carlisle Towery, who helped designate downtown Jamaica as a focus for development as an architect-planner with the Regional Plan Association in the early 1960's and has been trying to make it happen as president of the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation since 1967.
Many of the intervening years have been difficult. The downtown shopping area once had three department stores, Macy's, Mays and the locally owned Gertz. "Macy's left in 1978 and Gertz closed in 1981," Mr. Towery said. "Mays held out for a few years longer and then it was gone too."
Banks moved their headquarters elsewhere and lawyers, real estate brokers and insurance agents, whose livelihood is based on commercial transactions, followed. The seven movie theaters that once operated in the area went dark as well and the local newspaper, The Long Island Press, folded.
"Jamaica took some huge hits over a 10-year period that would have killed some downtowns," Mr. Towery said. But it did not die. The old Gertz store was successfully converted into an office building and fast food franchises moved into empty retail spaces.
It is not that the area is a remote backwater. Within walking distance is a major terminal of the Long Island Rail Road. A new subway stop opened in 1989 directly below the site at Jamaica and Parsons Avenues, which was cleared for development in the early 1970's.
Nor has there been a lack of public investment. York College, a four-year school that is the newest member of the City University system, has grown on a 50-acre campus just to the south of the downtown area at a cost approaching $300 million. A million-square-foot building to house offices of the Social Security Administration was built on an adjacent block, and another for the Food and Drug Administration is scheduled to rise nearby.
"The essential strategy was for the public sector to be the pioneers in the area to create a setting for the private sector," Mr. Towery said.
But private investors proved highly resistant to such blandishments for a long time. In 1985 the Mack Company of Rochelle Park, N.J., was chosen as the developer amid high hopes. But there were delays in finishing the subway extension and other difficulties and the company was dropped in 1987.
The city tried again in 1994, but the proposed developer, Rosenshein Associates of Rochelle Park, lost its designation last year after failing to come up with a suitable plan.
One of the problems in developing the area, Mr. Towery said, is that there is no nightlife. Although there are plenty of people about during the day, when work is over they go home, leaving the streets all but deserted.
That is the reason for the focus on the Sony/Magic Johnson theater part of the project. "The activity will be at night and on weekends," said Paul A. Travis of Washington Square Partners and a consultant to Mr. Mattone. "And that is going to help the retail," he added. "It is very difficult to have successful retail operations without nights and weekends."
He said the development group hopes to complete its deal with the city, which would involve purchasing rather than leasing the site, by the end of the year. The plan is to start excavation by next summer with completion scheduled for the fall of 1998, in time for the Christmas shopping season.
One of the remaining issues is parking under the building. Mr. Travis said studies have found that residents of Queens tend to use automotive transportation for just about everything other than commuting to work. That means the more parking that can be provided, the more likely people are to see a movie and shop.
THE current plan calls for one level of parking with 225 spaces, but Mr. Towery and others say what is really needed is two levels, with 400 spaces. But charging market rates would discourage the overriding goal of filling the offices during the day and the movie theater and shops during nonbusiness hours.
"We probably won't be able to charge more than $5 a day or $75 a month, compared to $250 to $300 a month elsewhere," Mr. Mattone said. "And it will probably be only $1 for someone who goes to a movie."
So the developers are looking to public agencies for financial help in building the garage. "This is a commercial project that stands on its own from the ground up," said Mr. Mattone.
"Parking is always a difficult and expensive issue in New York," said Mr. Millard. "E.D.C. understands that the state plans to subsidize the cost of parking."

HEADLINE: ATLANTIC CITY;
The Talk of the Town

BYLINE: By BILL KENT 

 BODY:
CAN Seymour (Pinky) Kravitz save Atlantic City?
Never mind that, on paper at least, the city may not seem to need saving, with record levels of new investment, gambling, new construction and infrastructure improvements. Mr. Kravitz, an Atlantic City public school teacher and radio personality for most of his 69 years, thinks otherwise. 
 "What was once a solid, functioning community where you could make a home for yourself has basically shattered," he said in an interview before beginning his daily radio show, Mondays through Fridays from 4 to 6 P.M. on WOND-AM.
"There's been hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes spent, but the people who live here haven't benefited all that much because they're divided racially, economically, ethnically and politically into so many factions and interest groups that they're almost paralyzed with rage. Unless something's done right now to bring people together and get everything out in the open, we're going to lose whatever shot we have at taking control of our destiny."
Mr. Kravitz has been broadcasting for 39 years. Unlike others who have used talk radio as a bully pulpit, he is generally viewed as an impartial advocate for the improvement of Atlantic City as a whole.
"I think that Pinky is a very beautiful person," said Dorothy Dorrington, a former teacher and school board president. "I've known him ever since I came into the school system in the 1950's, and he pours his heart out to the community so that when things happen that need attention, they get attention. He truly loves Atlantic City."
The fact that he has been broadcasting from improvised studios in casino hotels since 1979 -- currently from a lounge at the Trump Plaza -- is not, he said, the reason he refuses to blame the casino industry for the city's growing pains.
"There were a few chilly years at the beginning, but since then, the casinos have bent over backwards for Atlantic City," he said. "They pay two-thirds of the local taxes. They support hundreds of charities. They donate hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment and services to schools and local organizations."
Last month, on his radio show, he called for a town meeting in Convention Hall for residents to sound off about themselves, elected and appointed officials, and, of course, the casino industry. Within weeks, he came up with a commitment from Convention Hall, and a date, Oct. 10 at 7 P.M. He has arranged to have the meeting broadcast locally on radio and cable television.
"Everybody gets three minutes to say what they want, without interruption," he said. "And everybody will have to listen, without interruption. Any issue is up for grabs."
If anyone else had suggested this meeting, it would not have gone beyond the planning stages. Known for his schmoozy interviewing style, close connections in local politics and unabashed boosterism, Mr. Kravitz has managed to keep his 6-foot, 4-inch frame above the fray.
Having interviewed out-of-towners from Eleanor Roosevelt to Sammy Davis Jr., former locals like Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, and almost every Atlantic City politician in nearly 40 years. Mr. Kravitz has become an expert at what he calls "playing fair with people."
"Tall guys have to learn early on to be especially fair with people, or they'll think you're picking on them, even if you're not," he said. "I always leave anything that's said open to debate and interpretation."
Only once did an interview go sour, Mr. Kravitz said. After appearing on his show, former Mayor Jay Bradway tried to have him dismissed from the schools. "He didn't like the questions I was asking," recalled Mr. Kravitz, who has since retired. "You win some, you lose some."
He is confident that his town meeting will change the way the city's residents think about their future.
"I keep reminding people that this isn't the first time Atlantic City has had a town meeting," he said. "We had one back in 1975, when the state voted against statewide casino development. Everybody was worried and angry and complaining and divided. I went to the town meeting, and I stood up and said: 'I don't think we should give up on the casino issue. I think we should try one more time to get it passed in Atlantic City.'
"And look what happened."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Insurance for Funds: Safety for Whom?

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
INVESTORS might be attracted by Fidelity Investments' plan to insure money market funds because it would increase the safety of their investments. But money fund insurance represents a much bigger opportunity for the fund companies, analysts say: it promises to limit their liability.
From an investor's point of view, "I think that money market insurance is really unnecessary," said Peter G. Crane, editor of the Rated Money Fund Report, a trade publication of IBC/Financial Data in Ashland, Mass. 
 Burton J. Greenwald, a mutual fund consultant in Philadelphia, called the insurance plan "a marketing gimmick" with no "substantive value" to the investor.
Investors as a group have not shied away from uninsured funds. This year, they have poured more than $100 billion into money market funds through August, outpacing last year's big gain of $144 billion. Total assets in money funds, which many people use interchangeably with bank savings and checking accounts, reached $856.7 billion at the end of August, according to IBC, surpassing for the first time the $806.4 billion that the Investment Company Institute, the Washington trade group, counted in bond/income funds.
Money market funds are usually the most stable type of mutual funds, investing mainly in short-term notes issued by corporations or the Federal Government. Money market accounts opened at banks make similar investments, but these accounts carry Federal deposit insurance.
Like most mutual funds, money market funds are not insured. So investors could lose some or all of their investment, although that has rarely happened.
Fidelity is proposing to form an insurance company that would be owned by the mutual funds it insures. Those funds are owned by their shareholders, not Fidelity. The insurance would cover only $100 million of the $80 billion that Fidelity investors keep in its 23 money funds. Because the insurance premiums are deducted by the funds as an operating expense, Fidelity estimates that the premiums will cost shareholders 0.005 percent to 0.01 percent a year (or one-half to one basis point).
The insurance, awaiting approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, would cover only losses that occur when the issuer of a portfolio security defaults on its obligation. It would not compensate for losses from interest-rate shifts, called market risk, or from any possible fraud by Fidelity or its employees, or similar operational risks.
Among other big fund companies, the Vanguard Group, Merrill Lynch and Franklin Templeton are looking into insuring their money funds, but Capital Research and Management, which offers the American Funds group, has no such plan.
A unit of the Marsh & McLennan Companies, the insurance broker in New York and owner of Putnam Investments, said it had received "a tremendous amount of interest" in the last four weeks in an insurance plan it was selling to fund companies. "We've been talking to about 20 complexes -- seven or eight quotes are out now -- and I expect those folks to be going to their trustees for approval," said Michael C. Nicolai, senior vice president of Marsh & McLennan Inc., who declined to name the companies.
Given the small amount of coverage Fidelity is offering, "for safety, a Treasury fund would be a lot safer than an insured money market" under the proposal, Mr. Crane said.
Moreover, the investor's option of owning money market funds that hold strictly United States Treasuries, or Government money funds that own Treasuries along with short-term issues of Government agencies, limits what Fidelity or any other fund company can pay for credit insurance and still be competitive.
After comparing yields the last two years, Mr. Crane found that taxable money funds, which include Government funds, had an average yield advantage of only 0.06 percent over just Government money funds. That, he said, appeared to leave little room for the cost of credit insurance.
United States Treasury money funds are the safest available. Their yields have been 0.3 percent lower, on average, than those of taxable money funds the last two years.
It makes sense, therefore, to consider that amount as the ceiling for the cost of insurance. Bear in mind that Treasury dividends are exempt from state taxes, which lowers the ceiling to 0.25 percent or less, depending on where the investor lives.
So "insurance," in the form of Government-guaranteed securities, already costs investors from 0.3 percent for pure Treasury funds to 0.06 percent for Government funds.
"There definitely will be talk of types of insurance going forward," Mr. Crane said. "But it's tough to see how it could be cost-effective, given that the spread between Government and regular taxable money funds is so narrow."
WHEN Vanguard offered an insured money market fund during the 1980's, it paid substantially more, roughly 0.25 percent, for the coverage it bought from St. Paul Insurance, said Ian A. MacKinnon, senior vice president and head of fixed-income funds for Vanguard. In 1989, Vanguard rolled the $154 million fund into its United States Treasury money market fund.
"It was a prohibitively expensive deal for shareholders, given the minute risk of loss," Mr. MacKinnon said. "The investing public did not beat a path to our door."
The Vanguard insurance applied to an entire portfolio, but Fidelity proposes to cover only a little more than 1 percent of money fund assets.
To put that $100 million in perspective, however, it is more than the losses incurred in recent years by several money funds that lost money by investing in the complex financial instruments called derivatives. Virtually all of those losses were covered anyway by the fund management companies, several of which made cash infusions to prevent "breaking a buck," or letting the fund's net asset value fall below the $1 share price that money market funds aim to maintain.
That has happened only once. In September 1994, Community Asset Management liquidated a money fund because it could not reimburse the fund for $2 million of losses.
Fidelity's policy does not cover derivatives losses, but they are less likely to occur nowadays because restrictions have been tightened on the types of investments that money funds can own. And, clearly, Fidelity has safeguards in place protecting customers against employee fraud.
Why does Fidelity want to offer coverage that is so limited? Over time, the premiums should accumulate because the risk of credit default is so small, a spokeswoman said. That would create a reserve against future loss, or perhaps lower premium payments, she said.
Analysts suggest other benefits. Before, investors understood implicitly that Fidelity would guarantee their money funds' $1-a-share price even though the company never said it would, said John Rekenthaler, publisher of Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago. That is because other fund companies have almost always made good on such losses.
An insurance program implies that reimbursements would be limited to the coverage, he said. And limiting liability is likely to spread like wildfire in the industry, he contended: "If someone sets a precedent by not supporting a dollar share price and gets away with it, the other fund companies will follow suit."
Moreover, the loss would be borne by fund shareholders instead of coming out of the company's profits. "Why not pass the cost on to the customers?" Mr. Rekenthaler said. "That's only good business practice."

Music to Whose Ears? Arts Center and Neighbors Try to Work Things Out

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
The Scottish Festival scheduled today ends the first season of private management at the PNC Bank Arts Center, formerly known as the Garden State Arts Center. But that's not what nearby residents are likely to remember.
Instead, what will stand out are memories of the alternative-rock ENIT Festival on Aug. 17. The music went on all night and more than 100 people, primarily from Holmdel, filed complaints with the police about the noise. Twenty-five people were arrested for drugs or under-age drinking. 
 Lewis B. Thurston 3d, executive director of the New Jersey Highway Authority, which owns the arts center, later assured residents that there would be no more all-night concerts. But that has not stopped the growing chorus of concern, manifested in meetings, local newspapers and letters to public officials, that ENIT symbolizes bigger troubles down the road.
What they fear is a $12 million expansion of the arts center to 17,500 seats, from 11,300, that is being worked out by the state and the private operator, GSAC Partners, as part of a 20-year lease agreement starting with the 1997 season.
Supporters say the expansion is crucial for economic survival. "The whole idea of expanding the arts center is that we'll be able to pull bigger acts, and get more people to come," said Deborah Darrell, a spokeswoman for GSAC Partners, which includes Sony Music Entertainment, Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation, Pace Entertainment Corporation and Delsener/Slater Enterprises.
Detractors say the expanded project would produce too much traffic and noise for a township of only 12,000. "The mindset of the operating people is that only money matters," said Lois Bastian, who has lived in Holmdel for 30 years. "I've heard more and more people say the arts center used to be a nice place, but no more."
For most of its history, the tax-exempt arts center, which opened in 1968 with a concert featuring Van Cliburn and the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy, has co-existed peacefully with its neighbors.
The arts center hasn't been losing money; over the last seven years, it has averaged a net profit of $1.7 million. But classical music is not where profits are made, and so, Mr. Thurston said, the center has had to cater to other crowds. In 1995, for example, there were 14 sold-out shows -- mostly rock performers such as Hootie and the Blowfish, the Cranberries and Live.
To stay competitive, the arts center must be big enough to attract acts like Neil Diamond, Billy Joel, Bon Jovi or Elton John, said Mitch Slater, president of Delsener/ Slater Enterprises, who has booked acts at the arts center for the last 13 years.
The hope is that private management will accomplish that. First, the center's name was sold to PNC Bank for $9.2 million over the next 10 years. Then, the management group signed an interim lease agreement for 1996. Now, negotiations are continuing for the additional 20-year lease that would guarantee the highway authority a minimum of $1.65 million annually and give the state $30 million in sales taxes over 20 years, Mr. Thurston said.
But some people who live near the arts center are leery of what private management means.
 For example, in 1996, for the first time, beer and wine were sold at the arts center, prompting concerns about the increased risk of drunken driving -- especially since the arts center is accessible only by car off the Garden State Parkway and there are no public buses, said Michael Santos, a Holmdel resident and critic of the center.
Then there all the complaints about the ENIT festival, which featured acts such as Porno for Pyros and Black Grape.
Such concerns have not gone unnoticed. "We're very sensitive to the concerns of Holmdel, and we want to insure that we have good programming that's not unduly disruptive to the community," Mr. Thurston said.
However, maintaining order at outdoor concerts has become increasingly difficult everywhere. From 1994 to 1995, litigation related to rock concert injuries skyrocketed more than 500 percent, and insurance rates for promoters 75 percent, said Paul Wertheimer, founder of Crowd Management Strategies in Chicago, a consulting firm specializing in rock concerts and safety issues.
Meanwhile, more than 70 citizens' groups have formed in recent years to fight amphitheater noise and 10 lawsuits have been filed, said Jim Lewis, executive director of the National Clearinghouse on Amphitheater Noise, in Palo Alto, Calif.
Neighbors of the PNC Bank Arts Center are not at that point yet.
"We're not looking to reinvent the wheel here," said Mayor Robert Giannone. "We're looking to maintain the peace and tranquility that we had."

HEADLINE: IN BRIEF;
A Partnership to Rebuild Downtown Englewood

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
A generation ago, Armory Street was a solid, middle-class neighborhood just a few steps away from downtown Englewood. Over time, the street deteriorated until it was considered one of the worst streets not just in Englewood, but in all of Bergen County, because of its dreary auto repair shops and drug dens.
Two weeks ago, the city and Propitious Inc., a minority-owned development company, agreed to rehabilitate most of the one- and two-family houses on the block for eventual sale to owner-occupants. The plan is part of a broader redevelopment effort to bring businesses, and residents, back to downtown Englewood. 
 In April, the city initiated a $150,000 effort to make over the traffic circle at West Palisade Avenue and Tenafly Road, site of the historic Liberty Pole. Now, the Department of Community Affairs is providing grants to repair roofs, paint exteriors, replace heating and electrical systems, and complete other tasks to bring the buildings on Armory Street up to code. The Bergen County Community Development Program is providing money for new streets and sidewalks, new lighting and better drainage. And on Oct. 26, the Volunteer Center of Bergen County will spearhead an effort to plant a flower garden and beautify the street. DAVID W. CHEN

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Inflation Bonds May Prove Hard To Sell

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Inflation bonds are coming. Now the question is whether they will sell.
One viewpoint on that comes from a couple of fixed-income strategists at J. P. Morgan, Nanette Abuhoff and Hussein Malik, who forecast big demand: "Considering that the inflation rate is historically low, and the economy is running at or through full employment, it is reasonable to think that inflation risk is currently biased to the upside," they write in a well-researched analysis. "In such an environment, we expect demand for those bonds to increase." 
 It sounds logical, and the implicit recommendation for investors to buy is probably a good one. The 10-year bonds announced by the Treasury last week, and to be auctioned in January, will pay a fixed interest rate -- the real rate. But the principal will rise with inflation, so each interest payment is likely to be larger than the previous one. And when the bond matures, investors will get back dollars that can buy as much as the money they invested. The bonds will prove to be a good buy if inflation rises, but not if inflation continues to decline.
And that is why they are likely to be a difficult item to sell in 1997. Investors all too often keep their eyes firmly fixed on recent performance in deciding what to buy, and inflation has not been a threat recently.
In early 1982, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had a dividend yield of 6 percent and was trading at less than eight times earnings. Anyone who looked at historical norms would have concluded the market was cheap. But that was widely deemed irrelevant. What counted was that the stock market was lower then than it had been 15 years before. Stocks were proven poor investments, and few wanted them.
Now, almost 15 years later, stocks are expensive, and popular. After all, they have risen rapidly, and those who got in years ago have made lots of money. The dividend yield on the S.& P. 500 is 2.2 percent, while stocks go for about 15 times earnings.
The history of inflation bonds in Britain, which pioneered them in 1981 when inflation was rampant and people were scared, is that the biggest demand came at the beginning. So popular were they that investors accepted a real yield of just 2.5 percent, and that figure soon declined as people passed up double-digit yields on normal bonds to buy protection from inflation. Since then, as inflation scares have eased, higher real yields have been needed to attract buyers.
Inflation is not dead, and these bonds make a lot of sense for many investors, particularly individuals worried about retirement and pension funds whose liabilities will grow sharply if inflation does return. But those investors can, if they wish, buy inferior inflation protection now, in the form of investments like natural resources stocks. They can, if they want, even buy gold. None of those investments are doing well these days, however, because investors are just not concerned about inflation.
Attitudes could change by January, of course, and the Treasury may seek to hold down the amount of inflation bonds being sold, so that supply does not exceed demand. But it is likely that the bonds will have to be sold with a real rate higher than the optimistic figures of 3.25 percent or less that some expect.
If the real yield does come in at a relatively high figure, these bonds are likely to be good investments. But they still will be hard to sell. Investors all too often buy with their eyes firmly fixed on the rear-view mirror. And from that vantage point, inflation is no concern at all.

Dialing for Dollars, With Competing Flat-Rate Plans

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT 

 BODY:
AT&T introduced a flat-rate calling plan last week amid much fanfare. Under the program, customers can make a long-distance call anywhere in the country, at any time of the day, for 15 cents a minute.
Flat-rate plans are not new. MCI Communications, Sprint and a host of smaller long-distance providers have had similar plans for years. And MCI, whose flat rate is nearly identical to AT&T's, responded quickly, filing a request with the Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday to lower its rate to 14.5 cents a minute this week. 
 "We are not interested in starting a price war," an MCI spokesman, Michael Tierney, said. "We are trying to preserve our position as costing less than AT&T."
Flat-rate plans sound tempting, and they certainly offer a bit of freedom. You don't have to check the time before making a call under most of the plans or worry about the cost of calling across the country. But consumer groups say the plans are a good deal only for a certain type of person: someone who makes most of his calls during the day, when regular rates are often the highest.
"AT&T's flat rate targets small business and heavy daytime callers," said Sam Simon, general counsel of the Telecommunications Research and Action Center, a nonprofit group in Washington that evaluates phone plans.
He said there were better plans for people who make many short-distance, nighttime and weekend calls.
AT&T acknowledges that its new plan may not be the least-expensive available for residential consumers, who typically make most of their calls in the evenings and weekends. "If you are on a savings plan, on average, for all kinds of calling, the cost is 14.5 cents a minute," said Mark Siegel, an AT&T spokesman.
But the flat-rate plans are still popular. J. D. Power & Associates, the market research company, measured consumer satisfaction with long-distance services. Sprint scored first because of its flat-rate Sprint Sense plan, which charges 10 cents a minute during off-peak hours and a daytime rate of 25 cents a minute.
"There is a very strong perception that Sprint Sense is a good value because of flat pricing and because the bills are so easy to understand," said Zaiba Nanji, the director of telecommunications services at Power. Some consumers may even be willing to pay slightly more because the plans are so simple, Ms. Nanji said.
"For two years it has been our most successful product, bar none, because of the simplicity," said Robin Pence, a spokeswoman for Sprint.
If you want to save money, you'll have to do your homework.
Mr. Simon said that one way to get the lowest rate from your current long-distance company was to ask it to look at your bill and suggest its best plan for you. Or ask for comparisons from other carriers.
Getting the plans in writing helps you see surcharges or penalties that might not be in the sales pitch. If you don't want to do all this comparison shopping, the Telecommunications Research and Action Center sells a chart that compares most of the calling plans (800 344-8722, $5).
Even if you don't choose a flat-rate plan, under no circumstances should you use a basic program, said Bradley Stillman, the telecommunications policy director for the Consumer Federation of America. "Enroll in a plan," he warned, "or you will pay a rate that is way too high."

Inflation Is Coming! Inflation Isn't Coming! Bond Shoppers Can Decide

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
ECONOMISTS are excited about them, tax accountants may make a fortune from them, and Government officials say they are good -- and good for you, Average American Investors. But are the new "inflation-protection bonds" Washington announced last week really a great new development, or the investment version of the Susan B. Anthony dollar?
No one will know for sure until the Treasury tries to sell some, which will not occur until January. But many investors may be intrigued. "The appeal of these securities, while it is not universal, is pretty broad," said Ian A. MacKinnon, senior vice president for fixed-income investments at the Vanguard Group. 
 Here are the answers to some basic questions about the bonds.
Q. What's the point of these new bonds, anyway?
 A. Savers and investors will get a Government guarantee that the purchasing power of their money will keep pace with inflation -- and they will make some money, to boot.
 Q. How much money?
 A. That depends on what rate investors demand when the Treasury tries to sell the bonds, which in turn will depend on the public's appetite for these securities and where interest rates are when the sale occurs. Bond-market seers suggest the rate will be 3 percent to 4 percent.
 Q. Would that be a good deal?
 A. Probably. Over the last 70 years, the real rate of return on bonds, meaning the return adjusted for inflation, has been 1.8 percent, according to Ibbotson Associates.
 Q. So I should sell all my stocks and use the money to buy these new bonds?
 A. Well, no. If you are a tad nervous about the current state of the stock market, these bonds may be attractive. But over the very long haul, stocks of large companies have returned 7.2 percent (on top of inflation), which suggests that people with long-term goals will probably still do better by keeping much of their money in stocks.
"The downside of these bonds is that they could be horribly misused by people who think they can have their cake and eat it too," said Harold Evensky, a financial adviser in Coral Gables, Fla. He suggests that people who already own bonds or bond funds might redirect as much as 20 percent of the total portfolio to the new securities.
 Q. What does the Government get in the deal?
 A. In return for inflation protection, the Treasury expects to pay investors a little less interest than it pays on regular bonds.
 Q. How exactly will the new bonds work?
 A. As with regular bonds, an investor lends the Government money, say $1,000, and the Government promises to pay interest on the loan of, say, 3.25 percent. The Government also promises to repay the borrowed money on a certain date; to begin, all the new bonds will mature in 10 years.
The unusual feature of the new securities, which you can buy directly from the Fed or from a broker, is that the Government will adjust the size of the loan (the bond) to keep pace with inflation. So if inflation continues at 3 percent a year, the $1,000 loan will, over 10 years, become a $1,347 loan. The interest rate will remain fixed, but because the principal amount of the loan or bond is growing, the interest payments will be bigger.
 Q. Basically, you get the same-sized wedge of pie, but make more money because the pie is getting bigger?
 A. Exactly.
 Q. Who measures the inflation?
 A. The Government calculates it based on the Consumer Price Index for urban areas.
 Q. Hasn't there been talk that the C.P.I. overstates inflation?
 A. Yes. That may be a benefit for investors, though obviously there is some temptation for the Government to monkey around with the index. Treasury promises only that changes in the index will not be retroactive.
 Q. Do these bonds have risks?
 A. If you have to sell them before they mature, the amount you will get will depend on how much someone else is willing to pay -- and that could be less than you paid for the bonds in the first place. It is unclear how liquid the bonds will be, especially in the relatively small amounts that amateur investors typically buy and sell.
 Q. Are there any other drawbacks?
 A. Taxes. Not only do you have to pay Federal taxes on the income you receive, you have to pay taxes on any increase in the principal amount of the bonds -- even though you cannot realize that increase until the bond matures or you sell it. In some cases when inflation is high, you could owe more in taxes in a given year than you receive in income.
 Q. So I should try to buy these bonds in an account, like an I.R.A. or 401(k), that I don't have to pay taxes on?
 A. Good idea, although it may be some time before your retirement plan includes these bonds as an option. Relatively few 401(k) plans let participants buy individual securities, and it may be several years before mutual funds are available.

Swallowing Bitter Pills for Pay: The Trials of Guinea Pigs

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

 BODY:
LAST November, Adam Schumacher, a junior at the University of Connecticut at Storrs, stumbled into the campus infirmary with a sore throat and found himself with a job offer. If he would use a new gargle on his throat for just an hour, the company sponsoring the test would not only cover his medical bills, but also pay him $50 for his trouble.
"It was the easiest $50 I ever made," Mr. Schumacher said. "I'd definitely do this again, if I can find a test that I like." 
 Mr. Schumacher has plenty of company. Attribute it to the economy or to a dearth of attractive jobs for the unskilled. But this year, tens of thousands of people will take part in some 3,000 new clinical trials nationwide, testing everything from AIDS vaccines to remedies for cat allergies. And increasingly, these human guinea pigs are paid -- and sometimes paid well -- as researchers compete to recruit healthy, motivated subjects.
Walter Reed, the renowned Army bacteriologist, was one of the first to pay volunteers, offering people at the turn of the century $100 in gold to participate in yellow-fever experiments, and to give their estates $100 more if they died.
The Depression speeded the trend, with unemployed men paid $2 apiece to swallow tiny glass test tubes in experiments. Historically, subjects have also included prisoners and researchers themselves. But it has only been in the last 20 years that scientists have come to rely on paid subjects who were not desperate or coerced.
While payments for subjects remain a small expense in the $15.8 billion that the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America say is spent each year on drug research, it adds up to several million a year, leading a small but growing number of people to earn meager livings as guinea pigs by staying enrolled in several trials at once.
And while the trials pay, they are far from free of risk, or of trouble. Even though the tests are monitored by institutional review boards and the Food and Drug Administration, volunteers sometimes become sick or die. (In many drug trials, the test ends only when the subject finally suffers a reaction.) Participants may also misunderstand the time involved. And many of the tests can be grueling, if not painful.
"Doing these studies isn't for the squeamish or weak," said John Sanchez, 30, an unemployed Brooklyn musician who hopes to pocket $5,000 from medical trials over the next several months. A familiar face at every research institution in the New York City area, he takes a breather from the trials only when his arms are too bruised from needle pricks.
In Mr. Sanchez's first trial, he was paid $1,200 to take a mood-altering drug and then submit to blood and urine tests for two weeks. Shortly thereafter, he signed up for a trial that paid $250 -- and required a spinal tap. A day after the procedure, his head hurt so much that he returned to the hospital and was treated without charge.
"It was easy money during the first trial, but that spinal tap really hurt," Mr. Sanchez said. "You feel like you're doing something important for science, but the fact is that this is a job. You want to find the ones that pay well but don't demand too much of you."
So if you need a few extra dollars this month, medical science has a deal for you. Forget about donating your blood or giving away one of your kidneys. These doctors want to rent your whole body.
Consider these ads published recently in Washington area newspapers:
 
* "Women, if you want to have fun learning, enjoy good food, get $$ paid$$, and have a chance to help important research that can help you stay safer from H.I.V.," one ad says, it is time to apply. "Confidentiality maintained."
* "Healthy overweight children and normal weight children with two overweight parents needed," says an appeal for a National Institutes of Health research study.
* "If you currently use heroin or cocaine," another says, "and are interested in participating in a paid inpatient drug research study at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, please call the recruiting department."
INDEED, who knew that being allergic to bee stings, having genital herpes or being an addict could be so lucrative? Years ago, clinical trials like these would have paid almost nothing, but not any longer. To recruit their subjects, medical schools and independent laboratories are raising the stipends to compensate them for their time, inconvenience and risk. The median stipend at clinical trials nationwide is now about $950, 27 percent more than it was three years ago, according to Dataedge, a medical research firm in Fort Washington, Pa., but in some cases hourly rates may be only slightly above minimum wage because of the time involved.
"Some of the drugs that are being tested today simply require more time and effort than some of those that were developed in the past," said Steve Millikin, research director at Pharmaceutical Product Development, a clinical research company in Morrisville, N.C. "Since volunteers are spending more time at the clinic, of course, they should receive more money."
The rise in pay is gradually changing the recruiting strategies. Doctors once recruited volunteers for clinical trials by praising participation as a service to society. As subjects are paid more, researchers call them what they are, part-time workers, and recruit them with cash.
Researchers say the higher stipends enable them to hire more responsible subjects. While college students usually have no qualms about donating blood or urine samples, they sometimes balk at making daily diary entries about their reactions to a drug. Researchers say they think older subjects do not mind these menial chores, and may perhaps provide even more detail.
"A great many of the people who volunteer here are altruistic," said Karen Charron, coordinator of immunization research at the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health in Baltimore. "They're blood-donor types. They're interested in the good of the community."
The change has also given hundreds of thousands of people a growing source of income, though one with distinct drawbacks. Of the 3,000 clinical trials that will begin this year, many will pay $100 to $200 for each day. A select few pay as much as $1,500 for a few weeks of work.
Researchers say they don't have a profile of the people who volunteer for these jobs. The subjects range from civic-minded citizens who donate blood regularly, to people who suffer from the disease being studied. Others may be relatives or friends of someone who died from the disease. There is also a concern, though, that the pay is attracting people for whom passive activity is more appealing than an entry-level job at McDonald's.
Medical researchers say trial stipends are not high enough to coerce poor people into risking their health for a fast buck, but the evidence is not entirely convincing. Discomfort is a part of the business, and many volunteers quickly learn to accept it as an occupational hazard.
At the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, subjects receive $1,500 for participating in vaccine studies in which their hands are placed over a container of malaria-carrying mosquitoes until they are bitten at least five times.
Even minor aches and pains can pay: Come down with the flu, and doctors at the Camino Medical Group in Sunnyvale, Calif., will pay $100 for an overnight observation.
Try such experiments on some bunnies and animal-rights groups might storm the place. Humans are on their own. Eleonora Florance, a nurse in Annandale, Va., earned $450 last year testing a drug for seasonal mood disorder. Not only did Mrs. Florance have to give a blood sample every half-hour, she spent the night with a heat-sensitive probe in her rectum.
"The probe was uncomfortable, but these procedures don't surprise me since I'm a nurse," she said. "My kids said, 'Ooh, Mom, how could you stand it?' But learning about research is good for my profession. And I'm sort of a volunteer junkie. I sign up for almost everything."
 While trials may be painful, they can also be embarrassing. Sharon Donnelly, 42, a social worker in Maryland who counsels delinquent teen-agers, signed up for a three-year AIDS vaccine trial last year at Johns Hopkins and was shocked when a male nurse delved into the intimate details of her sex life.
"I was a little taken aback that they wanted to know every sexual practice and who did what to whom," said Ms. Donnelly, who receives $20 for each monthly visit. "Not only are you violating your privacy, you're violating your partner's as well."
Still, so many people are agreeing to submit to these procedures that qualifying for a trial can be difficult. Researchers determined to recruit the best subjects often reject more people than they accept.
"There is definitely no shortage of healthy volunteers for trials," said Dr. Leslie Norins, publisher of Clinical Trials Advisor, a national trade newsletter. "Some may come in for the money, but the truth is these trials are hard work. They can take a lot of time. You really have to want to be there."
Rookies often associate pain with a big paycheck -- a big mistake. The drug companies that sponsor the studies say they pay subjects for their time and inconvenience, not for exposing themselves to hazards.
"Clinical trials aren't about buying bodies for research," said Gary Steinman, president of GLS & Associates, a pharmaceutical consulting firm in New Preston, Conn. "The drug companies don't want volunteers to take chances for the money. They pay for the time involved, along with such inconveniences as blood and urine samples that may also be required."
Rates differ by trial, but most companies, including giants like Merck, pay subjects $100 to $200 for each testing day. A trial that required someone to come to a laboratory once a week for a month, for example, would pay $400 to $800. Multiple blood samples or extensive paperwork would bring more.
Experienced guinea pigs learn how to play a "feed and bleed" study, medical lingo for a clinical trial. The best tests are those that do not require much blood but are spread out over several weeks to raise the stipend. Other boons are trials that can be completed in a few days.
Jim Bauer, a retail banking strategist at Chase Manhattan, pocketed $250 this spring by taking a drug intended to relieve jet lag. During a business trip to Britain and Ireland, Mr. Bauer needed only to take one pill a day for four days.
"The drug really worked well because I felt great," he said. "The money was nice, but it wasn't as easy as it sounds. I had to go to the hospital where the study was conducted three different times. I had some time wrapped up in the trial, but it definitely paid dividends."
Most guinea pigs work only occasionally. But some make it at least a temporary career, seeking trials that pay top dollar and always staying enrolled in one test or another. Some do as many as five a month.
As part of an internship, Kim Conkle, a junior at Ohio State University, is participating in a vitamin C study at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. Ms. Conkle will live in a hospital room for six months, take daily vitamin C supplements and undergo a regimen of tests for a mere $15 a day.
"They pay for our room and board, so it's more than the money," Ms. Conkle said. "I plan to go into medicine, so this is just wonderful experience for that."
Trials are easy to find; every large medical school conducts research, and most actively recruit volunteers.
Many trials are also listed on the Internet. Two of the most popular sites are Centerwatch Clinical Trials Listing Service (http://www.center watch.com) and Clinical Trial Posting (http://www.clinicaltrials.com). Both sites list trials by diseases and by geographic research centers in the United States and abroad.
BUT volunteers may be surprised by the requirements -- not to mention what the researchers plan to do to them. For many studies, volunteers have to be healthy nonsmokers who shun drugs and alcohol and say they have had no more than four sexual partners in the last 12 months. But trials that examine sexually transmitted diseases may recruit subjects who have had many sexual partners, and studies of drug users seek out addicts.
On top of that, doctors want volunteers who are responsible and altruistic, not hustlers out for a fast buck. The most sought-after subjects are healthy people in their 30's and 40's who don't mind being stuck by a needle on occasion. In many cases, the ideal recruits are men, since many drug companies are concerned that they may test a woman who is pregnant but does not know it.
Taxes and insurance may also be nuisances. Some insurance policies won't cover illnesses or injuries contracted during clinical trials, leaving the guinea pig to foot the bill. Typically, subjects have to sign a consent form that entitles them to nothing more than free treatment for any conditions caused by the trial. And while trial stipends can be lucrative, clinics are required to report stipends of more than $599 to the Internal Revenue Service.
But that is far from a guinea pig's biggest risk. Despite precautions, the trials can be dangerous and even deadly. Three years ago, Marc Kusinitz, assistant director of science communicatons at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, signed up for a malaria vaccine trial to make $600 for his child-support payments. Mr. Kusinitz was told in advance that as part of a control group he would contract the disease. Days after laying his hand on a can of malaria-infected mosquitoes, he woke up tired and achy.
"I felt like hell," he said. But it was ready cash, and as a Ph.D. in biology he also had a professional interest in science. "One thing about being in the study," he said, "is that doctors are close by. And I was treated very quickly."
Malaria is curable, and Mr. Kusinitz recovered. Subjects are not exposed to incurable diseases like AIDS, because trial procedures are monitored by institutional review boards that are supposed to guarantee the safety of participants.
Some guinea pigs aren't so lucky. Hoi Yan (Nicole) Wan, a 19-year-old University of Rochester sophomore from New York City, died after suffering a heart attack in April after taking part in a research project in Rochester on smoking and air pollution, her family contends. As part of the test, which paid $150, Ms. Wan underwent a bronchoscopy, a procedure in which a flexible tube is inserted down the throat and lungs to retrieve cells. Before the study, Ms. Wan signed a consent firm acknowledging that the procedure could cause shortness of breath, wheezing and irregular heartbeat. The hospital also agreed to treat her for conditions sustained from the procedure if she should become ill.
MS. WAN was observed for about an hour after the procedure. Later that day, she collapsed at a friend's house and was treated at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester for cardiac arrest. In a lawsuit filed in State Supreme Court in Queens, Ms. Wan's family contended that the University of Rochester, the university's medical center, Strong Memorial and the two doctors who conducted the bronchoscopy had been negligent.
"What happened is that the doctors sprayed a lethal dose of Lidocaine down Hoi Yan's throat," said Salvatore Aspromonte, a lawyer with Dansker & Aspromonte Associates in New York City, which represents the Wan family. (Lidocaine is a local anesthetic.) "Clinical trials aren't trials when the doctors are reckless. Then, they're dangerous."
A spokesman for the University of Rochester Medical Center, Robert Loeb, said: "The lawsuit is in litigation. We plan to defend ourselves. The doctors who were involved in the study are still on staff and seeing patients." He said the doctors would not take phone calls about the suit.
On Thursday, the New York State Health Department reported after a four-month investigation that the medical center had violated its own trial guidelines by increasing the dose of the anesthetic on Ms. Wan. "A case like this points out the potential difficulties that can arise if the researchers don't pay enough attention to human subjects," Health Commissioner Barbara A. DeBuono said. "All these trials have review boards that oversee their procedures. The doctors can't change these procedures without checking with the review board first. That's not good practice or good medicine."
Dr. Jay H. Stein, vice provost for health affairs at the medical center, said in a statement that the Health Department report also concluded that the researchers involved "did follow standards that are consistent with established practices." The statement continued, "In light of this tragedy, we have established new guidelines on the use of Lidocaine during bronchoscopy."
It is unlikely that the hazards will keep human guinea pigs from drug testing. Some are hooked on the money, but others like the idea of helping science. Medical researchers are the first to say that without human guinea pigs, vaccines for polio, diphtheria and other diseases could not have been developed. The next goal is an AIDS vaccine.
"It was a tough decision for me to do this AIDS trial," said Ms. Donnelly, whose decision several years earlier not to have a baby was sealed when she enrolled in a trial that was capable of causing birth defects.
"Giving up hope of ever having a baby is hard," she said. "But it's good to know that I'm helping someone with this study, so in a way, I'm giving birth to something anyway. The money is just a bonus."

HEADLINE: When a Magazine Is Too Brash for the Bottom Line

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
AS Kurt Andersen remembers it, he was having fruit and cereal last February in the private dining room of the 42d-floor office where Henry R. Kravis runs his leveraged-buyout firm. Mr. Andersen, who was then editor in chief of New York magazine, says Mr. Kravis's breakfast message was clear: Consider killing a story about the rivalry between Felix G. Rohatyn and Steven Rattner, two of Wall Street's most powerful investment bankers.
Mr. Kravis is a partner at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, which controls New York's parent, the K-III Communications Corporation, so his opinion mattered. Although Mr. Kravis declined to be interviewed for this article, Mr. Andersen described their conversation this way: "He didn't want the piece to run. He said K-III and K.K.R. need relations with the investment banking community to be untroubled and robust." 
 It wasn't a suggestion that Mr. Andersen could dismiss lightly. Nevertheless, he dismissed it. Later that day, he briefed Harry A. McQuillen, the executive vice president of K-III and president of the media group, and told Mr. McQuillen he planned to run the story anyway. "He said, 'Absolutely do what you have to do,' " Mr. Andersen said. (Mr. McQuillen said he did not recall the conversation.)
The story was published in the March 11 issue, and while Mr. Kravis never mentioned it to him again, Mr. Andersen believes the financier did not forget it. In the months that followed, Mr. Kravis made his displeasure known to Mr. Andersen about other articles in New York, which K-III bought from Rupert Murdoch in 1991. And in late August, the New York editor was dismissed. While the official word was dissatisfaction with circulation numbers, Mr. Andersen and many of his colleagues said that Mr. Kravis was the not-so-invisible hand wielding the hatchet.
"The firing of Kurt Andersen is the kind of thing that sends a chill throughout magazine journalism," said David Denby, New York magazine's longtime film critic.
New York City's publishing and journalism circles seem to be learning the hard way what Wall Street has known all along: for Mr. Kravis, master of the deal, New York magazine is no big deal. He may like having it as the brightest media star in the K-III constellation of mass-market consumer magazines, which includes Seventeen and Soap Opera Digest, but he is not going to bend his investment principles or abandon his friends just to indulge its celebrity editor.
No matter that New York magazine's national political columnist, Jacob Weisberg, and its news editor, Larry Doyle, have quit in protest or that the business columnist, James J. Cramer, says he will join the mini-mutiny when his contract is up. And let the media community engage in all the collective hand-wringing that it wants. With K-III's stock languishing at around $10 a share since it went public a year ago, Mr. Kravis will do whatever it takes to get the price up and get out with some juicy profits.
Indeed, he is enforcing the same dictum for New York and its sister publications that increasing numbers of once-independent newspapers, magazines, television news shows and publishing houses are hearing from the giant corporations that have swallowed them up: make your numbers or else.
MR. KRAVIS'S main objective is to make money, lots of it -- and he has a pretty good track record so far. That is why he put part of Kohlberg Kravis's treasure chest behind K-III (Mr. Kravis's firm owns 73 percent of the company), which seeks to buy solid properties on the cheap, improve their performance and then sell them at a profit.
In the two and a half years since Mr. Andersen joined New York, the magazine, for all its success in winning over younger readers with its edgy tone and provocative subject matter, apparently fell short of K-III's goals. The company had hoped to reach an average weekly circulation of 435,000 to 440,000, Mr. McQuillen said; instead, Mr. Andersen had brought it up to just 425,000 from 415,000.
"Basically, we felt that at this point, the book could use a change in editorial direction," said Mr. McQuillen, who oversees K-III's magazines. "Kurt had done some good things with the magazine, but when all is said and done we didn't get as big a lift as we would have liked."
For all the attention New York brings to K-III, it is, in the financial scheme of things, almost inconsequential, representing less than 2 percent of the company's operating profit and trailing in circulation the company's lower-profile publications that have broader national appeal, like New Woman.
"It's too small to affect what I do," said Phelps B. Hoyt, a fixed-income analyst with KDP Investment Advisors who follows K-III's public bonds. "This falls way below my radar screen."
K-III officials say the company makes slightly better profit margins on some of its less sexy trade publications -- like National Hog Farmer and Adhesives Age -- as well as on some of its holdings in other areas, like Channel One, the school satellite network, and Pacific Shipper, a directory of shipping schedules for freighters.
"Out here in Montana, I wouldn't know what's going on with New York magazine," said Chuck Hunter, an investment research manager with the Montana Board of Investments, the state pension fund, which is an investor in the Kohlberg Kravis funds that own K-III. "Our ignorance is almost complete."
GIVEN New York magazine's modest financial stature relative to K-III's entire portfolio, and its disproportionate potential for upsetting Mr. Kravis's friends, some people may wonder why K-III holds on to the property. Indeed, when asked if he ever thought about simply dumping New York, William F. Reilly, K-III's chairman and chief executive, replied, "I've been tempted from time to time."
In reality, Mr. Reilly understands the value of having a high-profile magazine like New York in K-III's stable: it gives the company added clout among advertisers, credibility on Wall Street and cachet in the media community. "It's a door opener," Mr. Reilly said.
But if the magazine is essentially window dressing for one of Kohlberg Kravis's most visible properties, Mr. Kravis is clearly the one who decides how the goods are displayed.
And while Mr. Kravis can be expected to care little about stories in K-III magazines like Modern Bride or Fleet Owner, what New York magazine publishes matters deeply to him. "These are his friends," said a former K-III employee who insisted on anonymity. "This is what he cares about, this is where he lives."
Aside from the piece on Mr. Rohatyn and Mr. Rattner, the articles in New York that Mr. Kravis is said to have found objectionable include one last January on money laundering by the Russian mob that raised questions about the role of Republic National Bank, which is controlled by Edmund J. Safra, the former American Express executive. Another was a feature in March about "walkers" who escort New York's wealthy women around town; one of the walkers was Mr. Kravis's friend Oscar de la Renta, who helped the financier's ex-wife Carolyne Roehm get her start as a fashion designer. Mr. Andersen said Mr. Kravis himself called to relay the displeasure of Mr. de la Renta's wife, Annette, in response to the piece.
Some suspect the final straw was last month's lead story on Bob Dole, which depicted the Presidential candidate with his eyes closed on the cover next to the headline, "Bob Dole, Wake Up!" and identified Mr. Kravis as one of Mr. Dole's wealthiest New York contributors.
THIS is not the first New York magazine regime to feel the heat from Mr. Kravis. According to writers at New York and one K-III executive, all of whom insisted on anonymity, Mr. Kravis once phoned Edward Kosner, Mr. Andersen's predecessor, and asked him to yank an article on Leon Black, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert executive.
Mr. Kosner, now editor in chief of Esquire magazine, said that he did not recall a call from Mr. Kravis but that the story had stalled because both Mr. Kravis and Mr. Black refused to discuss a deal they were negotiating.
The author of the article on Mr. Black, Craig Horowitz -- who is still a contributing editor at New York -- said the piece was killed because of pressure from Mr. Kravis, but declined to discuss the circumstances.
According to a high-ranking K-III employee, Mr. Reilly was disappointed by what he viewed as Mr. Kosner's cave-in to Mr. Kravis. Indeed, Mr. Reilly, by all accounts, does his best to play middleman and mollify both sides. While he shares Mr. Kravis's attention to the bottom line, he has also repeatedly sought to protect Mr. Andersen from Mr. Kravis's opinions.
While Mr. Reilly declined to discuss his role as a buffer, Mr. Andersen said that Mr. Reilly and Mr. McQuillen frequently ran interference between him and Mr. Kravis, though not always successfully. "Henry Kravis was always on them, always unhappy," Mr. Andersen said. "They filtered as much of that as they could to prevent him from calling me. Harry would say, 'You've got to do what's right journalistically. We'll take care of Henry.' "
BUT in the end, Mr. Reilly and Mr. McQuillen said, they did not dismiss Mr. Andersen at Mr. Kravis's direction. "He never asked me to fire Kurt and he never asked me to pull a story," Mr. Reilly said.
Rather, K-III executives maintain, Mr. Andersen simply failed to meet K-III's financial expectations -- an exacting standard of which other K-III editors are well aware. "You're not working for executives who are former editors or publishers," said Caroline Miller, the editor in chief of Seventeen magazine who -- along with New York's executive editor, Michael Hirschorn -- is a leading candidate to succeed Mr. Andersen. "They are not people who have done your job before or would like to be doing it or who want to tell you how to do it.
"That gives me a tremendous amount of freedom. But it's completely understood that if the magazine doesn't perform well, changes will be made."
(Richard Babcock, the editor of K-III's Chicago magazine, has been serving as acting editor in chief.)
Mr. Andersen said his magazine was performing well, that he had done exactly what the company originally asked him to do, and been given nothing but positive feedback from his bosses.
He said his mandate was to reduce the median age of readers and "give the magazine some edge," a talent Mr. Andersen had honed as an editor of Spy magazine.
"There was never any discussion with me or the publisher of, 'We've invested this money and we expect a return on it to this extent,' " Mr. Andersen said.
Indeed, staffers at New York magazine say K-III's party line seems wholly unconvincing. "None of the reasons that they've given make any sense," said Mr. Doyle, the former news editor. "They knew we were going to have to shake off older readers to get younger ones -- if they didn't know that, they are morons. The same people who watch 'Murder She Wrote' don't watch MTV."
By most industry standards, New York was doing well enough. For the six months that ended in June, its total average paid circulation was 433,832, up four-tenths of 1 percent from that period the year before.
In addition, the number of ad pages had increased slightly to 1,176 for the six months that ended in June, up from 1,152 for the period in 1995, and ad revenue increased 4 percent in that period, to $23.3 million, according to the Publishers Information Bureau.
The magazine also had a cash operating profit of about $6 million on revenues of about $30 million under Mr. Andersen, said someone close to the publication's operations. Moreover, Mr. Andersen points out that during his first year at the magazine, in 1994, newsstand sales were up about 20 percent over all, and that the circulation of subscription-driven magazines like New York tends to move less sharply than those driven by newsstand sales.
Given those numbers, Mr. Andersen said he could not help but feel blind-sided by K-III's decision to oust him before his $500,000 annual contract -- including a $110,000 bonus -- was up in February.
Even some advertisers are scratching their heads. "I guess what I don't understand is that things seemed to be going well," said Roberta Garfinkle, the director of print media at the advertising agency McCann-Erickson. "The circulation was up a little bit, ad pages were up a bit. In this economy, that would appear to be a good sign."
Not good enough for K-III. The company contends that it sounded the alarm bells loud and clear early on, but Mr. Andersen didn't seem to hear them. "Over the last six to nine months, all key barometers took a negative turn," Mr. McQuillen said. "Newsstand was off 8 percent; the insert cards in newsstand copies and subscription copies were off 10 percent; renewals were off by 9 percent."
Although New York had seen a jump in readership among 17- to 25-year-olds, the core readership among 40- to 50-year-olds had begun to defect, he noted. "Readers were leaving the book," Mr. McQuillen said. "The core readership was diminishing, even though we were getting a group of younger readers. Our hope was for the book to do both."
In addition, two K-III focus groups last April, of about a dozen people each, indicated that some readers were disillusioned with the magazine. They wanted more stories about New York, more service-oriented pieces and a less nasty tone in the magazine. And New York's spring direct-mail campaign -- a solicitation of new readers through junk mail -- was disappointing.
TO be sure, the K-III empire has not exactly been a runaway success. The company is highly leveraged, and its stock performance -- shares closed at $10.375 on Friday, up barely from its initial price of $10 on Nov. 1, 1995 -- makes some people wonder whether Mr. Kravis showed his usual savvy in putting about $600 million into K-III. It is hard to imagine Kohlberg Kravis making the same kind of return it reaped this month on the sale of Duracell International Inc. to the Gillette Company: more than $3 billion in profits from a $350 million investment.
"What the New York magazine thing says is that K-III has yet to be a particularly successful investment for KKR," said one investment banker who follows the company closely and spoke on the condition of anonymity. "KKR has not made a significant amount of money on this investment yet and it is a very large one for them. Therefore, there is a high state of nervousness and agitation around K-III."
Investors who participated in leveraged buyout funds put together by Kohlberg Kravis in 1987 and 1993 bought stakes in K-III before it went public and paid about $6 a share. With the stock at $10, they have a slim paper profit, far below what investors typically expect from such high-risk investments. What's more, if Mr. Kravis's investor group, as the majority owner of K-III, tried to take profits by reducing its stake, it would never realize that modest gain because the public investors would feel abandoned and bid down the stock.
But others think Mr. Kravis is on the mark. Media conglomerates are hot these days, precisely because so many investors see huge profit potential in the supposedly synergistic interplay among entertainment, information and cyberspace.
Despite the stock's recent sluggishness, K-III has been generating impressive cash flow since Mr. Reilly and two fellow executives left the Macmillan Inc. publishing house in 1989 to start K-III with Kohlberg Kravis's financial backing.
K-III's free cash flow -- a measure of profitability calculated by taking net earnings and adding back interest, taxes and noncash charges like depreciation and amortization -- has grown more than 30 percent a year since then, to $216.1 million last year. Sales surpassed $1 billion in 1995, up from $845 million in 1993; Mr. Reilly projects they will triple to nearly $3 billion by the end of the century.
"This is a good management team," said John A. Canning, Jr., the president of Madison Dearborn Partners, a private equity investment company in Chicago, another Kohlberg Kravis backer. "K.K.R. knows what they're doing on this one."
Even K-III's patchwork of properties seems to make Wall Street happy. In a seven-year acquisition binge, it has amassed more than 400 product lines across 15 different businesses, including 125 magazines. Recent purchases have included 14 Cahners consumer magazine titles, including American Baby and Sail, for an estimated $180 million, and Westcott Communications, the nation's largest producer of national training courses broadcast by satellite, for $422 million.
"Over all, I like the prospects because they have so many things that are unique niches," said Mr. Hoyt of KDP Investment Advisors. "The more diversification, the less chance of a surprise negative."
That sort of analysis does not hold much water with some investors and media types. They worry that K-III's hodgepodge of holdings reflects a lack of purpose. "They have not entirely figured out the thrust of their company -- whether they want to own a series of trophy properties or a bunch of lesser-known, cash-cow-type things," said someone at another publication who is familiar with K-III and insisted on anonymity.
Not surprisingly, New York magazine staff members cringe at the owners' bottom-line imperatives, calling them misguided and potentially counterproductive. "One of the most revealing comments that's ever come out of there -- I forget if McQuillen or Reilly said it -- was, 'There is no magic in this,' " said one New York magazine writer who insisted on anonymity. "There are those of us in this business who like to think there is some magic in it. It's not like producing airplane parts or cigarettes or some mass-market food. It is different."
OR is it? In discussing Wall Street's perception of K-III, Mr. Reilly likens one of his magazines to other consumer products. "Seventeen is as much a brand as Ivory soap," he said. "If you have a brand position, you're more stabilized. Nobody is knocking Campbell's soup off the counter -- or Seventeen."
This commodity-minded culture, Mr. Andersen said, does not bode well for his yet-to-be-named successor, or for the future editorial independence of New York magazine. "Anybody who has an ambition to do tough, important journalism should give serious thought to whether they're going to be able to do that happily at New York," Mr. Andersen said, "and not perpetually be looking over their shoulders to a degree that is paralyzing."

INTEREST RATES
Who's Afraid of the Fed?
There's always a lot of nail-biting about what the Federal Reserve is going to do to interest rates. But does it really matter? Or is the economy such a mighty machine that it will find its own course, take it or leave it. For investors, of course, it's all the same; since some people believe that a Fed rate rise will hurt stocks, everyone has to act as if that is true. So in the weeks leading up to last week's Fed meeting, practically every rise or fall in the market was pinned on the latest twist in the great Fed guessing game. When the Fed finally met, it left rates alone; there were suggestions that Alan Greenspan didn't want to rattle things right before the election. Naturally, stocks, which logically should have risen, fell instead; maybe investors were simply exhausted by the waiting game, or maybe they could stand only so much good news.
 
THE ECONOMY
The Poverty Rate Falls
The good news, as reported by the Census Bureau last week: household income -- yes, adjusted for inflation -- is up for the first time since 1989, the poverty rate fell to 13.8 percent in 1995 from 14.5 percent the year before, poverty among the elderly is down, and the poverty rate for blacks dipped below 30 percent for the first time. So whether the glass is half full or not, it definitely has a bit more water in it. The bad news, of course, is that in a nation as ridiculously wealthy as this one, nearly 30 percent of any group should be living in poverty.
 
BOB DOLE
Wrong Station, Perhaps?
With so many economic numbers looking good -- unemployment low, inflation in check, stocks soaring -- President Clinton would just love to point at the charts and crow, "I did that!" That would clearly be an exaggeration, though -- probably a big one. But the fact remains: those numbers do look good. So one can only marvel when Bob Dole, defiantly sporting his "15 percent" button to remind any inattentive souls of his promised tax cut, argues that the economy is "not on the right track." Yet that's what he said last week in an address to the Economic Club of Detroit, lambasting Mr. Clinton as an "old-style, dyed-in-the-wool, big-spending liberal."
 
AT&T STOCK
Sorry, Widows and Orphans
Now this doesn't quite make sense. They say the economy's a pillar of strength, yet a traditional pillar of that economy -- the pillar that the proverbial widows and orphans lean against -- is wobbling. Last week AT&T said it wasn't doing too well this quarter, and its stock tumbled nearly 10 percent in a day. One analyst was puzzled by how AT&T could do so badly in "an industry that is growing very rapidly." But others hinted that AT&T could be the next tottering giant, following in the oversized footsteps of I.B.M. and General Motors. The rapid growth of long-distance service, with its hot competition, could be the problem. And speaking of that competition, AT&T also made its latest move last week, offering a 15-cent flat rate for domestic calls. But that couldn't breathe life into its shares.
 
FAREWELL, CASH?
(Pretty) Smart Cards
Some people can't leave anything alone. Now you'd think that cash was a perfectly good way of paying for many things, and that the ritual of passing bills and making change represented a modest social interaction in a society fixated on computerizing itself into immaculate anonymity. But no: "smart cards" are on their way, with computer-chip "cash" neatly imbedded in them. Last week, though, Bell Communications Research raised a red flag, saying it had found a possible flaw that might make it possible to counterfeit the cards. The sabotage it envisioned, though, was surprisingly low-tech: one variant had something to do with first putting the cards in the oven. That, it seems, sends the cards haywire, providing an opening for the computer thief to creep in and tinker. It all makes dollar bills look awfully sensible.
 
AIRLINES
Pan Am, Infrequently
It's sad, really sad, what befalls our defenseless language. You'd think that if someone said "Pan Am," the topic would be the legendary airline. No, it's just some people who bought the name and started a few flights last week. Or take "frequent flier." Those words are already so far removed from the idea of flying frequently -- "Brother, can you spare a few miles," the New Age panhandler will say -- that a whole generation is surely coming of age with no memory of the original meaning. And now that reborn Pan Am is muddying the water -- or muddying the air -- even further, offering one and a quarter frequent-flier miles for each mile flown. And you can get a free ticket with 20,000 miles, not the usual 25,000. Here's the question, though: How frequently can you fly on an airline that goes only from New York to Miami and Los Angeles?
It was clearly a week of new beginnings in the airline industry, as the Transportation Department also gave Valujet permission to start flying again.
 
COLLEGE COSTS
That Tuition Monster
It's a number guaranteed to give parents an instant anxiety attack: $20,000 a year for tuition (plus room and board, of course). Multiply by 4 (or 8, or 12) and you're not just talking serious money -- you're talking, for most people, impossible money. But when the College Board released its annual tally of college costs last week, it said that fewer than 5 percent of students actually pay that $20,000. More than half, in fact, pay less than $4,000. And while tuition again rose faster than inflation -- 6 percent at public schools, 5 percent at private -- "college is still accessible" for most Americans, the head of the College Board said. One big shift is that while there is plenty of aid available -- $50 billion last year -- loans are taking a bigger chunk than grants.
 
DEATHLY BATTLES
Funeral Giants at War
You'd never go to the equivalent of a Wal-Mart or a McDonald's to arrange a funeral -- you'd naturally go to that homey, familiar place in the oversized Victorian down the street. This business, dependent on civility and soothing tones, would never tolerate a voracious corporate giant -- or would it? Actually, it would, and two of them are in a battle royal, with the Loewen Group digging in its heels last week against a $3.1 billion takeover offer from Service Corporation International. The illuminating thing about all this bursting into the open, of course, is the staggering size of these giants -- and that, appearances aside, one of them just might own that mom-and-pop funeral parlor on the corner. Big Mac with a side order of gladioluses, anyone?
 
IMAGINED FORTUNES
Talk About Thin Air
They can't be serious. Even in this age of Wall Street hotshots stretching the truth or bending the rules a bit to amass some obscenely large fortune, it's just too outlandish. But when Federal prosecutors last week charged Christopher Bagdasarian with fraud, conspiracy and a raft of other misdeeds, this is the tale they told: that Mr. Bagdasarian got $24 million in bank loans solely on the basis of letters from an accomplice at Deloitte & Touche saying, falsely, that he was worth millions, and that he spent the money on a California mansion and private jet. Not satisfied with that, prosecutors say, he formed a company called Normandy America and tried to take it public -- even though any company assets were pure fiction. No investors were hurt, for Normandy's moment in the sun lasted all of one day -- Aug. 15, 1995 -- before trading was halted. No money changed hands. Prosecutors weren't joking around: the charges could mean up to 165 years in prison.

One Man's October Surprise . . .

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FROM a historical perspective, the biggest October surprise in this Presidential campaign could well be if there actually is one.
The bogyman of front-runners and the fantasy of laggards and antsy journalists, an October surprise -- a bolt of news upending the race -- could include anything this year from an economic jolt to a disaster in Bosnia to an indictment of a Clinton Administration official, or even of a Clinton. At least so speculate the bored journalists, the Clinton aides who are nervous or superstitious and, most fervent of all, the Dole campaign officials. 
 But Alan Brinkley, a professor of American history at Columbia University, had to cast back to the last century for an example of such a surprise. "Lincoln's re-election seemed in real doubt in the spring," he said, "and the changing course of Union fortunes in battle insured his victory."
Still, even that turnabout failed to qualify as a genuine October surprise, he said; those changed fortunes were cemented by the fall of Atlanta -- on Sept. 2, 1864.
Professor Brinkley sounded rather unsurprised that a journalist was inquiring about surprises. "I've never seen such a desultory campaign, and journalists themselves seem so desperate for something to write about," he said. "No offense."
One Clinton aide pointed out that a surprise could benefit the President, who has already, Dole officials grumble, had his share of political breaks, including more good economic news last week. Some surprises that have cropped up late in campaigns have merely confirmed the course of the election.
In October 1972, for example, Henry A. Kissinger declared that "peace is at hand" in Vietnam. But President Nixon was not exactly in dire need of a boost in the polls against George McGovern, who lost by a landslide.
The term "October surprise" dates from the 1980 election, when Ronald Reagan and his aides worried that Jimmy Carter would pull off a coup by springing the hostages in Iran before the election. He didn't, of course, and some analysts have tried to prove, so far inconclusively, that the Reagan campaign had a hand in thwarting him.
Indeed, while history offers few actual October surprises, it does present some tantalizing might-have-beens. In 1940, Wendell Willkie warned that Franklin D. Roosevelt had a secret deal with the British to enter the war. But he never presented any evidence, said Michael R. Beschloss, a historian of the Presidency.
"One could say that if the full extent of Roosevelt's dealings with the British, and particularly with Churchill, had been been revealed, it would have changed the course of the election, and Willkie would have won," Mr. Beschloss said.

HEADLINE: Promising Trade-Off for the Needy

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Sept. 24

 BODY:
After 40 years of combating poverty in the obscurity of inner-city St. Louis, George Eberle Jr. now finds welfare experts from around the country knocking on his door.
They have come to look at the method Mr. Eberle devised that lets people who are short of cash get a baby sitter, simple car repairs or rides to the doctor's office. 
 People obtain these services through a type of barter system, using make-believe money called "time dollars." To earn the dollars, which can also be exchanged for donated goods like household staples, they do other services, like reading to the blind or cleaning a neighbor's home.
All these chores add up to real work. And with the enactment of the nation's new welfare law, with its emphasis on moving people from dependency to jobs, Mr. Eberle's system has caught the eye of foundations, research organizations and public officials. While they acknowledge it has limitations, they say it can be a tool both to create a sense of community through a novel form of commerce, and to meet the new law's work requirements.
"This is the place you would go look" for a model of a welfare-work system, said Michael E. Hartmann, director of research at the Wisconsin Policy Institute in Madison, which is urging communities in that state to develop work-bartering systems like this one. Richard P. Nathan, director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany, said, "We ought to be trying to replicate that and expand it."
Gary J. Stangler, director of the Missouri Department of Social Services, said the system should help the state meet some tough provisions of the new welfare law, like one requiring that 25 percent of a state's welfare recipients be working at least 20 hours a week in the coming fiscal year and 50 percent be working at least 30 hours a week by 2002.
Mr. Stangler said the system should help the state meet the terms of the law for another reason -- it helps provide child care. Child care is scarce in the inner city, yet vital for young mothers who are being required to work under the new law. The time-dollar system has allowed for widespread use of child care, along with close supervision and training of the providers.
Mr. Stangler credits Mr. Eberle's organization for insuring the quality of the program's supervision and organization.
Mr. Eberle, 68, is president of Grace Hill, a nonprofit, private agency in Murphy Blair, a neighborhood on the city's Near North Side. Established as a settlement house by the Episcopal Church in 1903, Grace Hill is now a social services conglomerate, running a job-training center, five health-care centers and other programs, in addition to the time-dollar system. It has an annual budget of $15.6 million and a staff of 400, drawn largely from the neighborhood.
The time-dollar system started slowly, but with the help of a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation nine years ago and then with computerization, transactions have soared. In 1992, people earned 9,552 time dollars. By last year, their earnings had quintupled, to 45,026 dollars, and through August this year they had reached 41,014. About 3,000 people participate, some occasionally, a few more than 20 hours a week.
"They're doing an extraordinary job," said Edgar S. Cahn, a founder of the Legal Services Corporation during the Johnson Administration and now president of the Time Dollar Institute, formed in Washington a year ago to promote barter systems.
Mr. Cahn, who, like Mr. Eberle, was an early apostle of cash-free commerce, helped organize a similar barter network in Miami that reaches 4,000 people. But, he said, that program has yet to achieve Grace Hill's level of technological sophistication. Much smaller networks have been started in many other communities, including Washington, Brooklyn, Chicago, Cleveland, Portland, Me., Grand Junction, Colo., and Norfolk, Va.
Mr. Eberle, who has a degree in social work from Washington University here, went to work at Grace Hill at age 26 and became president six years later, in 1960.
He developed the time-dollar system here as a way to breathe life and community spirit into places that stores, factories and most other private sources of employment and commerce had fled.
"How do you increase the capacity of a community to respond to its needs?" he asked. "How do you take a neighborhood and capture the sparks that are there?"
He said that most people have talents and needs, that most will respond to one another's needs and that in responding they can create social capital -- a community's wealth as measured in skills, services, interdependence and good will.
But to fuel the engine of social capital-building in a community where the rent can consume most of a welfare check, Mr. Eberle needed something other than money. So he developed the time-dollar system. Two sisters, Leopra Drummond, 59, and Mary Toles, 53, both unemployed residents of Murphy Blair with chronic health problems, explained how the system works.
"If we do something for a neighbor, we're paid for it in time dollars," Ms. Toles said. "We have to make out a slip."
"We go to someone's home," Ms. Drummond said. "Clean their house, wash their dishes, wash their clothes."
"Go to the store for them," Ms. Toles said. "Read to them if they're blind. I'm having trouble with my sight. Certain times, a neighbor will come and write for me, write recipes. I pay them with time dollars."
The transactions are recorded in a computer, with 30 terminals reaching nine neighborhoods, that also serves as a yellow pages of time-dollar services. The time dollars can also be exchanged for goods at two simple stores run by Grace Hill and stocked through donations.
"We can use them to go purchase household items," Ms. Drummond said. "Toilet paper, tissues, perms for the ladies' hair, the shampoo, the conditioner."
"Pampers and diaper wipes," Ms. Toles added. "Bug spray, rat poison. Just regular household goods."
In addition to the Johnson foundation, another leading philanthropy, the Rockefeller Family Fund, is sponsoring bartering projects. During the summer, officials of another, the Annie P. Casey Foundation, toured Grace Hill. For public-assistance officials and philanthropies like these, barter systems offer a means of helping the nation's poorest communities adjust to the welfare law.
Officials say they are impressed by how the system can generate work and work experience as it helps foster commerce and community cohesion.
The most widely used services include child care, house cleaning, tutoring, making phone calls for people who cannot, delivering meals to the homebound and giving people rides to stores and appointments.
Work paid for in chits rather than real dollars may be unconventional, but it appears to suit the law's definition of work.
The law says work can include time looking for a job, some vocational training, and community service for public and nonprofit employers for which workers continue receiving welfare checks in lieu of regular pay.
The system also opens a road to the world of real work. It helps groom communities' least-educated, least-employable residents by teaching them workplace disciplines like making appointments and showing up on time.
Quran Boykins, 27, a single mother who left school in the 11th grade and has children aged 10 and 7, is in the throes of that transition.
As a time-dollar worker, she said, "I go to my mother and wash for her for two hours, and that's two time dollars. I go to another person and do four hours of cleaning, and that's four time dollars."
Meanwhile, she was working toward a high school equivalency diploma at Grace Hill's job-training center. Then, a few days ago, she climbed another rung. She took a job in a hospital kitchen that pays $4.70 an hour.
The system has limits. Some of its services, like relatives doing chores for relatives, probably would not be considered work under the welfare law, Mr. Stangler said.
And while it supplements the resources of families that qualify for welfare checks, it is of little use to single, working-age adults who are largely ineligible and need real money for rent before they need help cleaning the house.
Still, inner-city residents seem to value the time-dollar system, and for more than the work it provides. "This is basically a way of having some self-esteem, of having good feelings," said Charles Bradford, 58, whose diabetes forced him to retire on a small pension from a good job as a machinist.
Mr. Bradford earns time dollars helping to manage the system and doing odd jobs for people like moving furniture.
"It takes away the pain of not having a real job," he said. "I feel good about myself at the end of the day."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DRUG ISSUE;
What Price Victory? Study Feeds Contention

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

 BODY:
At first glance, a dispute about economic correlations of price and consumption might seem an arcane quibble. But in this election year, some Republicans on Capitol Hill have accused the White House of skulduggery by suppressing a study that maintains it is more cost effective to reduce the cocaine supply by interdicting it in Latin America than to reduce demand by treating addicts in the United States.
The study, "An Empirical Examination of Counterdrug Interdiction Program Effectiveness," was submitted to the White House's Office of National Drug Policy this year by the Institute for Defense Analyses, a research group that usually works on contract for the Pentagon, though never before on a study of the price of illegal drugs. 
 Its authors criticized a study by analysts from the Rand Corporation who determined that cutting American consumption of cocaine by 1 percent through interdiction at the source would cost $783 million a year but only $34 million by treating addicts. The study by the Institute for Defense Analyses concluded that reducing demand by 1 percent by interdiction at the source would cost $8 million a year.
Specialists in drug policy who have read the new study have dismissed it as flawed and naive.
"I think a huge yawn is the appropriate reaction," said Mark A. R. Kleiman, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. "It's pretty clear that they started out with an answer and fitted the question to the answer."
The report has been construed as supporting Bob Dole's contention that President Clinton failed to stop drugs from coming into the country by diverting resources to treatment.
The Subcommittee on National Security, International Affairs and Criminal Justice in the the Republican-controlled House plans to hold a hearing on Tuesday into why the study was not released by the new White House director of drug policy, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey. His office circulated copies of the report to drug experts for comment, which has been overwhelmingly negative.
A member of the subcommittee, John L. Mica, Republican of Florida, said he believed that the report was suppressed because it was highly critical of the White House policy.
"If what I've heard is borne out by the facts, we're going to be calling for some resignations," Mr. Mica said in a telephone interview. "To have the report not only ignored, but also buried, is going to raise a furor."
Though he stopped short of asking General McCaffrey to step down as the White House's director of national drug policy, Mr. Mica added: "The first action of the new drug czar was to make it known that none of this was to get out. I'm completely dumbfounded by his action."
Before he took his new post, General McCaffrey commanded the United States Army Southern Command in Panama, where he ran the drug interdiction in Latin America that the new study cites so favorably. While he wished he could take the credit, the general said in a telephone interview, "it seems whimsical to suggest that our contributions drove up the price and drove down the use of cocaine."
The Administration is allocating two-thirds of its $15.3 billion drug-control budget to the supply side of the drug war and one-third to the demand side. "We are absolutely supportive of rigorous source-country strategy, and continued interdiction," General McCaffrey said. "But at the end of the day, the war will be won around the kitchen table, with parents talking to children."
The study includes a chart that shows that since 1985, increases in the price of cocaine in American cities have coincided with interdictions in Peru, Bolivia and Colombia.
But Peter Reuter, a drug-policy expert at the University of Maryland, said, "This implies, for example, that the hundreds of thousands of domestic arrests and imprisonments, the 70 or so tons that the D.E.A. seizes domestically and all other aspects of domestic enforcement have no impact on price, or at least that their impact is constant."
He and others also questioned the study's description of the illegal drug market as free and unrestricted. Drug syndicates sometimes maintain substantial inventories to minimize disruptions and hold back cocaine to manipulate the price.
Critics have said the study inaccurately calculated the rise in drug prices. To determine the cost of drugs on the street, the study used the prices for drug shipments as large as 22 pounds. But street sales, reckoned in fractions of an ounce, are inflated by markups by local dealers. The study cited prices of $50 to $85 a gram in 1992 and 1993. One expert said the prices were actually $120 to $168 a gram.

HEADLINE: In France, Leaders Brace For the Worst From Unions

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 28

 BODY:
President Jacques Chirac and his unpopular conservative Government hunkered down this week to face a second autumn of unrest over spending cuts that they insist are necessary even with unemployment at its highest level in nearly 50 years.
Some subway and bus workers in Paris went on strike Friday for a pay raise and an end to job cuts, but they did not bring service to a halt. Commuter traffic in the Mediterranean city of Marseilles, however, was severely disrupted. 
 Teachers have called a nationwide strike for Monday, and all the big railroad and civil service unions plan to stop work for 24 hours on Oct. 17. They are protesting the Government's plans to trim the public payroll as part of a spending freeze intended to cut the budget deficit.
Some union leaders have predicted a repetition of the two-week national transportation shutdown that brought most of the French economy to a standstill late last year, but Mr. Chirac and Prime Minister Alain Juppe insist that the painful austerity is needed to get France ready to adopt the common European currency planned for the end of the decade.
Mr. Juppe promised that the new European money system would bring "an economic big bang for Europe and for France," which needs one more than ever now that unemployment has risen to 12.6 percent of the labor force.
But a big bang in 1999 would be too late to save Mr. Juppe's Government from the possibility of defeat in national elections in 1998. With public opinion polls showing support for his policies now below 30 percent, there have been mutterings of revolt from the ranks of his party, the Rally for the Republic, and its partners in the Government coalition.
Mr. Chirac sharply reminded party conference participants in Le Havre this week that he and Mr. Juppe expected their loyalty, and the Prime Minister has asked the conservative-dominated Parliament for a vote of confidence on Wednesday.
His plans include a budget freeze to keep the Government deficit next year to $56.7 billion, the 3 percent-of-gross-national-product limit imposed by the monetary clauses of the Treaty on European Union in 1992. The Government has also called for an increase in alcohol and cigarette taxes to bring down the health insurance and retirement system deficit to $9.4 billion by 1997.
The United States Government budget deficit, by comparison, is less than 2 percent of the American gross national product, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
"We have been living for decades with the idea that we could do whatever we wanted, and pass on the deficit to future generations," the Finance Minister, Jean Arthuis, said. "We have been paying Government functionaries' salaries partly by borrowing. We have to end such irresponsible forms of behavior."
But the budget freeze -- and plans to reorganize deficit-ridden national transportation systems -- will mean that tens of thousands more jobs will be lost to attrition, labor unions predict, and prominent Government supporters like former Prime Minister Edouard Balladur have pleaded recently for a letup in the austerity.
With one national poll by the French Public Opinion Institute showing 83 percent of the voters in favor of a change in economic policy, Marc Blondel, whose Workers' Force union led the national rail shutdown last year, tested the militancy of his supporters at a demonstration on the Place de la Bastille a week ago. He predicted that as many as 100,000 people might show up, but despite sunny skies, only about 10,000 did.
"I keep hearing that things are going to explode this autumn," said a rival union leader, Louis Viannet of the Communist-led General Confederation of Labor. "I really don't know, but we are in a situation which could very rapidly trigger a reflex of revolt."

HEADLINE: Even Allies Astonished At Spending On Museum

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: HARRISBURG, Pa.

 BODY:
As controller of this modest-size city, Jim McCarthy is expected to review public expenditures with a sharp eye, which is why he became alarmed when aides told him last year that the Mayor had bought a $35,000 cannon.
"I said, 'A cannon?' " Mr. McCarthy recalled. " 'What are we doing with a cannon?' " 
 While the city council has agreed to spend $7.8 million in a controversial effort to create a first-rate Civil War museum to stoke the local economy, Mayor Stephen R. Reed has been stockpiling historical objects at a far greater rate than many had expected.
In a city with an operating budget of $81 million this year, Mr. Reed has been shifting the proceeds of bond issues to allocate about $13.7 million over the past two years just on items for the museum, which has yet to be built.
He bought Abraham Lincoln's hat box, minus the hat, for $40,000; Ulysses S. Grant's harness and tack box, for $65,000, and Stonewall Jackson's gauntlet, for $68,000.
To those treasures he added hundreds of more mundane items like a mess kit for $5,500; a tin shaving cup, $100, and a bale of cotton, also $100.
The artifacts are scattered, stored in the public safety building, the city government center and even a maintenance garage.
The breadth and cost of the collection have stunned critics. In an editorial titled "Reed's Folly?" The Patriot-News said the purchases ranked as "one of the more bizarre municipal expenditures in the state, if not the country."
The plan for the museum, which Mr. Reed envisions will draw tourists from the nearby Gettysburg National Military Park, is particularly questionable to those who see far greater needs in this city of 54,238.
"You look around and you see houses that are in desperate need of help," said Wendi Taylor, 48, who lives in the Uptown neighborhood. "You see roads that need to be improved. You see trees that need to be cut back and sidewalks that need to be repaired. It seems to me, for the good of our community, a Civil War museum shouldn't be on the top of the list."
But with the Mayor, the city council and most other city officials, including Mr. McCarthy, all Democrats, Mr. Reed has faced few obstacles, but some raised eyebrows. Councilwoman Peggy Grove, as well as Mr. McCarthy, support the project, but said they were astonished by the level of spending.
Mr. Reed, who is in his fourth four-year term, dismissed suggestions that he was ignoring higher priorities like street repair and housing to focus on the museum. "We've spent much larger sums than $13 million on virtually all of those things," he said.
Besides, he added, to be a success, the museum has to have an expansive and impressive collection. "It can't be a run-of-the-mill small museum that has the usual customary musket, cartridge box, belt buckle," Mr. Reed said. "It's got to be one of a kind."
The proposed name reflects such ambitions: the National Civil War Museum at Harrisburg.
Mr. Reed said the collection would cover from 1850 to 1895 and include exhibitions on slavery and the westward expansion. Officials expect construction of the museum to begin late next year, with the opening in 1998.
A history buff, Mr. Reed is counting on Harrisburg's proximity to Gettysburg, 38 miles south, to attract Civil War enthusiasts. He estimated that 10 percent of the 1.7 million visitors a year in Gettysburg would also visit Harrisburg, the state capital.
Though home to Camp Curtin, a large training ground for Union troops, Harrisburg saw no action in the war, and it has no battlefield.
"One of our intents in our exhibits is to try to pique people's interests," said Katie Lawhon, a public affairs specialist at Gettysburg. "We want to encourage them not only to leave the museum and get on the Gettysburg battlefield, but to visit other sites related to the Civil War. Harrisburg is definitely a part of that."
Mr. Reed helped revitalize the city when it was on the brink of financial collapse at the start of his administration in 1981.
When a downtown hotel went bankrupt, the city bought it. When the prized minor league baseball team, the Senators, threatened to move to Massachusetts, Mr. Reed had the city buy it, too.
"Yes, he's popular," the president of the Council, O. Frank DeGarcia, said. "Why? Because he gets things done."
Occasionally, Mr. Reed and his staff conduct economic development seminars for officials of other small cities, encouraging them to diversify.
"The museum suddenly didn't emerge as 'This is Harrisburg's answer to building the tax base,' " Mr. Reed said. "That would be absurd. It is part of a much bigger picture that includes many different types of endeavors."

Dole, in Choosing Kemp, Buried A Bitter Past Rooted in Doctrine

SERIES: A POLITICAL LIFE: Overcoming Differences

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Even in an age of politics by autobiography, Bob Dole is to an unusual extent running for President on the strength of his own history -- his Dust Bowl upbringing, his sacrifices in World War II, his memories, as he said in his acceptance speech, of "an America only the unknowing call myth."
But when Mr. Dole embraced Jack Kemp as his running mate last month, he put a long stretch of his personal history aside. 
 As the two men have traveled across the country together, beaming and bantering with each other, it has not seemed to matter that they had spent nearly 15 years arguing and exchanging insults. Nor did it seem to matter that Mr. Kemp had secretly helped engineer one of Mr. Dole's most costly and humiliating defeats as a legislative leader.
Nor did it even seem to matter that just five months before Mr. Dole picked him as a running mate, Mr. Kemp had dealt Mr. Dole the ultimate political affront, endorsing his opponent in the Republican primaries, Steve Forbes, well after it was clear that Mr. Forbes had no chance of winning the nomination.
Although private animosities are often put aside for national campaigns, the history of conflict between Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp is, in fact, much more than that. A look at their shared past shows that the two men clashed not merely because they were rivals for political power -- though this was doubtless part of it -- but because they saw themselves as representing alternative futures for the Republican Party.
Until last month, Mr. Dole could have been called the essential Midwestern conservative, a deficit hawk who advocated that the Government not spend more than it took in.
As a young Representative, he was, for example, one of the few Congressmen to vote against the historic tax cut proposed by President John F. Kennedy.
Mr. Kemp, by contrast, made his mark in Republican politics as one of the early champions of supply-side economics. He has advocated sweeping tax cuts as a way to solve many, if not most, of the nation's problems, and has pointed to the Kennedy tax cuts as an inspiration. He has long maintained that deficits don't really matter and that the fears they generate are a mere "bugaboo."
No less significantly, Mr. Kemp has often chastised advocates of austerity for holding back the Republican Party. The debate between the two factions, in his terms, has a world historical cast. On his side of the divide are the "New Testament Republicans," on Mr. Dole's side the "Old Testament Republicans."
At the time of its announcement, many compared Mr. Dole's selection of his former antagonist to his earlier decision to step down from the Senate. Again, Mr. Dole had surprised the political establishment with an imaginative and risky move: in picking Mr. Kemp, he was forgoing the obvious advantage of a running mate from a battleground state.
But the deeper ties between the two decisions may lie in the way they both elide history. Like Mr. Dole's choice to give up the Senate and campaign as "just a man," his running with Mr. Kemp again demonstrates his willingness to ignore the past even as he campaigns on its basis.
 
The Early 80's
 
Opposing Views On Economic Policy
The antagonism between Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp dates from the early years of the Reagan Administration, when both were at the center of a series of bruising political battles over supply-side economics.
More than anyone else, perhaps, Mr. Kemp moved the supply-side agenda from obscurity to the center of the national debate. In early 1980, he signed on an important supporter for the agenda: then-candidate Ronald Reagan. (David Stockman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget during Mr. Reagan's first term, has recalled that Mr. Kemp returned from a trip to California early that year and announced that Mr. Reagan had been successfully "converted.") Mr. Reagan subsequently made Mr. Kemp's proposal for a 30 percent across-the-board tax cut one of the central features of his Presidential campaign.
Once Mr. Reagan was elected, his Kemp-inspired plan became one of Mr. Dole's chief concerns. It fell to him, as the new chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to push the tax plan out of committee and through the Senate.
In years since, Mr. Dole has claimed credit for the tax bill's passage, and many of his allies today argue that it could not have happened without him. At the same time, his position was ambiguous enough for Mr. Kemp to later claim, with some justice, that Mr. Dole was actually a foot-dragger who resisted the tax cut "every step of the way."
Certainly, Mr. Dole made no secret about his reservations about the plan. Much to the annoyance of the supply-siders, Mr. Dole mused out loud about the dangers of a large tax cut even as the tax bill was wending its way through committee, worrying in front of reporters that it could spur inflation.
But the real break with Mr. Kemp and his allies occurred after the Reagan tax plan was already approved.
Within months of the bill's passage in the summer of 1981, Mr. Dole began to push for a package of tax increases -- or "reforms," as he preferred to call them -- to bring the growing deficit down. This, in turn, Mr. Dole argued, would lower interest rates, which many at the time argued were hampering an economic recovery.
In response, Mr. Kemp went public with his opposition to any sort of tax increase. In an Op-Ed piece in The New York Times, Mr. Kemp criticized those like Mr. Dole who, he argued, were "being lured by the siren song of Wall Street." He blamed high interest rates not on the Government's fiscal policies but on its monetary policies and argued, as he often did, that the answer to the problem was a return to the gold standard. He called the ballooning deficit the "new bugaboo."
The Op-Ed piece was typical of Mr. Kemp. During his tenure in the House from 1971 to 1989, he did not serve on any tax-writing committees, nor did he devote himself, like Mr. Dole, to the nitty-gritty of legislative compromise. Instead, he often aired his views directly through the press. "Kemp had a lot to say on taxes," said an aide who worked for Mr. Dole in the early 1980's, "but basically he had little to do except make pronouncements."
Mr. Kemp's headline-grabbing strategy enraged many of his colleagues, including, it seems, Mr. Dole. "Bob was sometimes apoplectic about the attention Jack got by virtue of his clarion calls," said former Congressman Barber Conable, who at the time was the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee.
Mr. Dole's tax package, which included a host of revenue-raising measures from higher excise taxes on cigarettes to increased airport fees, was known as the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, or Tefra. Though Mr. Reagan reluctantly agreed to support Tefra, Mr. Kemp still tried to get the measure killed as it went to conference.
Working outside the Republican Congressional leadership, he sent telegrams to his allies summoning them to a series of private stop-Tefra meetings on Capitol Hill. In a letter he circulated among them, he warned ominously that "quietly, without debate, the Republican Party is in danger of making a U-turn back to its familiar role of tax collector for Democratic spending programs." Participants in these closed-door meetings said that about three dozen legislators and Administration officials attended, including Representative Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott, then a Representative.
Many in the Republican leadership were sharply critical of Mr. Kemp for holding the meetings, and Mr. Dole publicly chastised the participants. "I am somewhat distressed to see Republicans leading the charge to undermine the President," he said, and he went on to compare the opposition to the tax package organized by Mr. Kemp to the Democrats' opposition to President Johnson over the Vietnam War.
Eventually, Mr. Dole won the battle over Tefra. The measure passed the House in August 1982, though Mr. Kemp voted against it, arguing, in a formulation favored by supply-siders, that it was a similar sort of tax increase that had led to the Depression.
Afterward, Mr. Dole enjoyed a burst of positive press for his achievement. During one of the many interviews he gave at the time, Mr. Dole told The Washington Post, "I never really understood all that supply-side business."
 
The Mid-80's
 
The Differences Grow More Bitter
The next few times he clashed with Mr. Kemp, Mr. Dole would not be so lucky.
In the summer of 1984, Republicans gathered in Dallas to write the party's platform for the fall election. Along with allies like Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Lott, Mr. Kemp was advocating an unequivocal plank on tax increases that would, effectively, put President Reagan on record as ruling them out. Mr. Gingrich explicitly referred to such a plank as "Dole-proof."
Not surprisingly, Mr. Dole opposed such a plank.
"Let's not trap the President," he argued at platform committee hearings in August. When the plank backed by Mr. Kemp and his allies was adopted, Mr. Dole dubbed the group, often called the Young Turks, "the Young Hypocrites."
"They think they can peddle the idea that they've taken over the party," he said. "Well, they aren't the Republican Party, and they aren't going to be."
Many saw the fight over the platform as the opening round in the battle for the 1988 Presidential nomination, and to a certain extent it was. But Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp faced off in a far more consequential battle just one year later.
In 1985, Mr. Dole, ever more concerned about the Government red ink -- and about holding onto the Senate's Republican majority -- decided to face the issue in classic deficit-hawk fashion. By now the Senate majority leader, he pressed his colleagues to adopt an austere budget that would have eliminated 13 domestic programs and, even more significantly, reduced cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security recipients.
In May, the Senate adopted Mr. Dole's proposed budget after a drama of rare suspense: Pete Wilson, then a Senator, recovering from an emergency appendectomy, cast the crucial "yea" vote from a hospital gurney, while Vice President George Bush cut short a Western swing and broke the resulting tie.
As with Tefra, Mr. Kemp once again went to work behind the scenes in opposition to Mr. Dole. The Senate budget plan, he argued, was a mistake, and he called Donald T. Regan, the new White House chief of staff, to press this argument. "I think we can get this budget back on track," Mr. Kemp later said he had told Mr. Regan.
Along with some other House Republicans, Mr. Kemp met with Mr. Regan in a series of negotiating sessions from which Mr. Dole was deliberately excluded. The meetings, at least from Mr. Kemp's perspective, had the desired effect: a few weeks after Senate Republicans had gone on record favoring Social Security cutbacks, President Reagan made a deal with the Democratic-controlled House and announced that there would be no cutbacks, after all. Aides to Mr. Dole complained that the Senator had been "blind-sided."
Associates say Mr. Kemp opposed the proposed Social Security cuts both on ideological grounds and on the more obvious grounds of practical politics. "Kemp had a strong commitment to Social Security as one of the last remaining Federal programs that's family-centered," said Jeffrey Bell, an economic consultant who has advised Mr. Kemp. At the same time, Mr. Bell said, he saw Mr. Dole's budget as "political dynamite."
In political terms, the Senate Republicans' budget vote had been enormously costly -- the Republicans lost the Senate the next year -- and the proposal's unraveling represents one of the most bitter defeats of Mr. Dole's legislative career. Mr. Dole made no secret of his outrage or of whom he blamed for his defeat. When he accused Democrats and "a few noisy Republicans" of "playing politics" with the budget, the allusion to Mr. Kemp was clear.
For the rest of that summer, Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp continued to spar in private and in public, eventually producing what still ranks as the most memorable exchange of their long rivalry.
At a meeting of young Republicans in July, Mr. Dole remarked with barbed humor that "Kemp wants a business deduction for hair spray." Speaking to the same group, Mr. Kemp came back with the retort: "In a recent fire, Bob Dole's library burned down. Both books were lost. And he hadn't even finished coloring one of them."
 
The '88 Campaign
 
The Deficit Hawk Vs. Mr. Growth
A few months ago, a longtime adviser to Mr. Dole, trying to explain how the former Senator thinks, singled out Mr. Kemp as a politician he found particularly irksome.
"He can't figure out how you can get to be Jack Kemp," the adviser said. In Mr. Dole's view, he said, Mr. Kemp is "non-deserving."
Over the years, Mr. Dole has often suggested that Mr. Kemp's political success was a function of his ability to side-step difficult choices. While Mr. Kemp preached painless supply-side solutions, he once said, "some of us do all the dirty work." At another point, referring obliquely to Mr. Kemp and his allies, he said: "They never made a hard choice in their lives."
For his part, Mr. Kemp often was publicly disdainful of what he called Mr. Dole's "root canal" approach to economics. And he openly blamed Mr. Dole and his fellow deficit hawks for keeping Republicans in the minority.
"The Republican Party lost this country with an almost obsessive concern with a balanced budget," he said during the heat of the 1985 budget debate.
In 1988, when the two men both ran for the Republican Presidential nomination, their mutual antagonism became one of the running themes of the campaign.
Although Mr. Dole largely tried to ignore Mr. Kemp, who was running far behind both him and Vice President Bush, he continued to stress that the time had come to make tough choices, and that Mr. Kemp was trying to duck them.
At one candidates' debate, for example, Mr. Dole declared: "We've got to deal with the deficit. We're not going to grow out of it as Jack used to say, just cut taxes and don't worry about it." At another debate, when Mr. Kemp spoke about "morning in America," Mr. Dole responded tartly that it was actually "high noon."
"That's the time to get ready and do something," Mr. Dole later elaborated. "It takes a while to get up in the morning. We need to deal with the deficit now."
Mr. Kemp, meanwhile, explicitly tried to focus the contest on his and Mr. Dole's competing economic programs and their implications for the party. In broad, even sweeping terms, he portrayed the race as a fight over two views of the nation's future -- one (Mr. Dole's) dark and gloomy, the other (his) sunny and glad.
The race, he said at one point, would come down to "a pain, sacrifice and bitter medicine Bob Dole campaign versus a growth, hope, opportunity progressive, populist, conservative Jack Kemp campaign."
Mr. Kemp's campaign press secretary, John Buckley, now Mr. Dole's communications director, expanded on that message, at one point declaring the contest between the two men a "struggle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party."
"The fault line in the Republican Party now is between the high-tax, deficit-mania wing that Bob Dole is the living embodiment of and the high-growth, low-tax wing that Kemp personifies," Mr. Buckley said.
With Mr. Bush's 1988 victory, the antagonism between the Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp became, for several years at least, largely irrelevant. Mr. Kemp left Congress, and Mr. Bush subsequently appointed him to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Dole, meanwhile, continued on as Senate minority leader. The two had relatively little to do with each other until the beginning of this year, when the Presidential campaign once again brought them into conflict.
 
The '96 Campaign
 
A Snub by Kemp, Then a Partnership
At the start of the 1996 election cycle, many in the so-called "growth" wing of the Republican Party were pinning their hopes on Mr. Kemp. After he announced he would not run, in January 1995, one of Mr. Kemp's friends and supporters, Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate, decided to join the race himself. Mr. Forbes ran almost entirely on the basis of his tax plan: the graduated income tax, he proposed, should be replaced with a flat tax that would represent an almost universal tax cut.
The economic prescriptions that Mr. Forbes was pushing were Mr. Kemp's prescriptions, as well; Mr. Kemp had, in fact, headed a Congressional advisory panel that, just as the primaries were about to start, had recommended a flat tax. This made Mr. Kemp's endorsement, always a prize, seem that much more valuable.
All winter, Mr. Dole's aides pressed Mr. Kemp to declare his support. "Scott Reed was calling on an hourly basis," David Smick, a former aide to Mr. Kemp, said, referring to Mr. Dole's campaign manager. At one point, the Dole campaign, according to Bob Woodward's campaign book, "The Choice," even went so far as to charter a plane to take Mr. Kemp from Washington to New Hampshire to make the endorsement. Mr. Kemp, however, repeatedly demurred.
"Last time we're dealing with the quarterback," Mr. Woodward quotes Mr. Dole as saying after Mr. Kemp passed up the chartered plane.
By the eve of the New York primary in early March, Mr. Dole's organizational strength had proved so overwhelming that Mr. Forbes's candidacy was effectively over. Nevertheless, it was at this moment that Mr. Kemp decided to endorse him.
For weeks, the Dole campaign had been hammering away at Mr. Forbes's flat-tax plan, arguing that it would increase the deficit and, by eliminating the mortgage interest deduction, actually raise many Americans' taxes. Announcing his endorsement, Mr. Kemp said that he could not tolerate the attacks on Mr. Forbes's "radical but profound" proposal.
The Dole campaign, and most of the Republican establishment, reacted to the inopportunely timed endorsement with a predictable mixture of fury and derision. Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Kemp's longtime ally, was reportedly so angry that he told Mr. Kemp he was finished politically.
A few days after the endorsement, Mr. Kemp told reporters, "I'm in my wilderness years."
Mr. Kemp's endorsement of Mr. Forbes was particularly astonishing because Mr. Dole's campaign manager, Mr. Reed, was one of his own former aides.
Mr. Reed had worked both on Mr. Kemp's 1988 Presidential race and as his chief of staff at H.U.D; at the time he went to work on the Dole campaign, he was executive director of the Republican National Committee. Mr. Reed later recruited Mr. Buckley, Mr. Kemp's 1988 press secretary, to run the Dole campaign's communications office, and also signed on another former Kemp aide, Kevin Stach, as a policy aide.
When the time came for Mr. Dole to pick a running mate, people familiar with the discussions say, Mr. Reed and Mr. Buckley both strongly advocated Mr. Kemp. Still, given the history of their relationship and Mr. Kemp's ill-timed endorsement, his selection seemed, even to many of his allies, almost ludicrously unlikely.
Mr. Dole alluded to the widespread surprise that greeted his selection in the address-cum-pep talk he delivered to Republican members of Congress a few weeks ago. "A lot of people said it would never happen," he said. "In fact, Jack said it would never happen."
Mr. Dole explained his choice of Mr. Kemp as complementing his decision to propose a 15 percent tax cut as the centerpiece of his campaign.
"It was a difficult choice," he said, "but it seemed to me with the economy being on the front burner and having an economic package, there is no better salesman in America than Jack Kemp. He's been out there doing it year after year after year."
Advisers to Mr. Dole maintain that his economic plan in no way represents a repudiation of his record on fighting the deficit. "Dole has not changed his spots," said Roderick DeArment, Mr. Dole's former chief of staff, who is now an adviser to his campaign. Mr. Dole, Mr. DeArment said, firmly believes that he can balance the budget while delivering a dramatic tax cut.
"He is convinced he will do it and can do it," Mr. DeArment said.
Many others, however, argue that it is difficult, if not impossible, to square Mr. Dole's history as a deficit hawk with his current proposal.
"I think he basically decided he had to do this to jump-start his campaign," Norman Ornstein, a Congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said of Mr. Dole's tax-cut plan. "Certainly it goes against the grain of much of his world view for a long time."
By this account, Mr. Dole's embrace of Mr. Kemp is less a change of heart than a change of tactics. Mr. Dole has not reconciled his deeply rooted differences with Mr. Kemp; he has simply set them aside. As Jack Pitney, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College and an expert on recent Republican politics, put it: "Dole realizes he can't always be Dole. Sometimes he has to be Kemp."
 
A Political Life
 The first article in this series about Bob Dole's life appeared on May 19. It reported on how his early years in Kansas shaped his politics. The second article, on June 21, was about his relationship with Richard M. Nixon, who was both a mirror and a mentor. The third article, on July 8, focuses on abortion and how the issue first affected Mr. Dole's political campaigns in 1974 and continues to do so in 1996. The fourth article, on Aug. 9, was about his legislative years. The fifth article, on Sept. 15, examined Mr. Dole's management style. These articles are available to computer users on The New York Times on the Web, at http://www.nytimes.com/library/politics/dole.html.

HEADLINE: City Plans to Auction Off A Bronx Group's Dream

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

 BODY:
Decades ago, the Bronx Borough Courthouse stood gleaming and grandiose, gazing down over boisterous stickball games and lawyers' social dens as the Third Avenue El rumbled by. Then fire and decay devoured the neighborhood bit by bit, and the lavish courthouse tumbled along with it, losing first its purpose and later its windows, roof and doors. For nearly 20 years, it was forgotten.
But for the community advocates who are slowly rebuilding this beaten-down area of the South Bronx, the courthouse, awash in graffiti swirls and caked with soot, has a redeeming trait: potential. They are convinced that the 1914 Beaux-Arts building at East 161st Street and Third Avenue can serve as a catalyst for neighborhood renewal, and in the last four years they have raised nearly $1 million to transform the building into a town center for the poorest Congressional district in America. All along, they thought city officials wanted the same thing. 
 Now the city, eager to divest itself of an empty courthouse that would cost $43 million to repair, is putting the building up for auction on Wednesday. Opening bid: $10,000.
"It's happening once again, I thought," said Yolanda Garcia, a founder of Nos Quedamos (We Stay), the group behind Melrose Commons, the $500 million urban renewal plan under way in the area. "I wasn't surprised. There was just anger, because they've known all of the time and effort that had gone into this building."
Petr Stand, an architect who works with Nos Quedamos, echoed a common belief among Bronx residents that the borough is considered the "armpit of New York." "If this were Manhattan," he said, "it would be very different."
While Nos Quedamos sees nothing but promise in the building, the city sees a financial drain. In the last 10 years, it has spent $400,000 to replace the roof, seal the windows and put up a fence, said Paula Young, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of General Services.
"It happens to be a beautiful, extraordinary building in our portfolio that we have no use for," she said. "The building has been allowed to fall into massive disrepair. The city doesn't have the money to commit to it."
The community advocates hope to turn the building into a headquarters for their redevelopment plan, a place where residents could stop in for information about housing and social services. They also envision it as a spot for social gatherings. They see it as a critical component of the renewal plan for Melrose, a community once so hard hit by arson, crime and indifference that more than half its population fled.
The plan, which involves building 1,700 housing units in the 35-square-block area east of Yankee Stadium, was approved by the City Council two years ago.
The courthouse, Ms. Garcia said, would "create a downtown in a place that never had one."
Ron Shiffman, who sat on the City Planning Commission for six years and reviewed the project's paperwork, said the courthouse seemed to offer an important remedy for the ailing neighborhood.
"I thought the planners and the community that worked on it really were putting their hands on a very significant aspect that has been lost in a lot of the revitalization efforts," Mr. Shiffman said. "We need not only new housing, but also to build that abstract, harder-to-feel thing called community."
In a sense, controversy befits the once-majestic courthouse, which was built in anticipation of the Bronx becoming a separate county. Even before the first block of granite was laid in 1905, the building had sparked a feud and a lawsuit between two architects, both of whom claimed credit for the design. The architect Michael Garvin won; his name adorns a small plaque on the facade.
Standing on a five-sided lot, the 86,000-square-foot building was already out of fashion the day it was completed in 1914. While skyscrapers taunted the clouds above Manhattan, the Bronx structure stubbornly clung to classical notions. Inside, sweeping marble staircases, terrazzo floors and leaded glass windows reflected an era of prosperity in the borough.
"The attempt was not only at esthetic beauty, but also an idea of solidity, of an imposing nature that said this is the majesty of government," Mr. Ultan said. Never mind that tucked high in a niche over the courthouse entrance, positioned to catch the eyes of Third Avenue El riders, Lady Justice sits comfortably without her usual blindfold.
As the Bronx's population boomed, a larger courthouse was built a few blocks away on the Grand Concourse. The older building, with only a single vast courtroom, was relegated to relic status. In 1978, the city stopped using the building.
Community advocates stepped in 15 years later, after time and indifference had battered the courthouse, to propose a plan. Initial meetings with the city over the courthouse's future began with the Urban Assembly, a nonprofit urban redevelopment organization, in 1993.
Richard Kahan, the group's president, pitched the concept: the groups would raise enough money to renovate and lease 3,000 square feet of the courthouse, pay many of the utility costs, seal off the rest of the interior and, little by little, fix it up. "Guerrilla landmarking," they called it.
The city seemed amenable, so the groups got busy. They raised $900,000 through public and private grants, corralled architects and stone cleaners into working for nothing and began discussions with possible tenants. The groups stressed to the city that they could not afford to rent or buy the entire space all at once and still pay for heating, renovation and insurance costs.
At one point, a draft copy of a lease circulated and appeared near approval by the city, Ms. Garcia said.
Last year, the city decided the proposal wouldn't work: $1 million was $42 million too little to cover expenses for a building deemed unsafe by the Buildings Department, Ms. Young said.
"We examined many different ideas and none were realistic in the long term," she said. "It will cost the city too much money to improve the building. And to lease a building on the short term, I don't think it's responsible and it's a piecemeal approach."
If Nos Quedamos wants to preserve the courthouse as a town center, it should attend the auction, Ms. Young said. "Nos Quedamos has informed everyone they have $1 million," she said. "They should bid on the building and use the one million as seed money."
Even if the group does not buy it, she added, "whoever buys that building will have to improve it. Nos Quedamos can negotiate with them. It will still be an anchor. Any improvement is an improvement, and everyone will benefit."
Because the building is landmarked, a buyer could not simply tear it down to build something else on the site.
Sitting in her office in a neighborhood once threatened by bulldozers, Ms. Garcia disagrees with the city's approach.
"The city built this public building with public funds for the public, and now they want the public to buy its own building back so it can be kept public," Ms. Garcia said. "That's not democracy as we know it."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE STRATEGY -- STATE BY STATE: Florida;
Florida Victory No Sure Thing For the G.O.P.

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 27

 BODY:
It was one of the more spirited strategic arguments within Bob Dole's campaign: Should he spend serious time and money fighting for Florida, where Republican nominees have prevailed in every Presidential election since 1980 but where he has been running behind, or should he husband his resources for the big Midwestern swing states and hope for the best here?
"You go all-out in Florida, and so maybe you win it," said one of those who argued against a major effort in this state, the nation's fourth-largest. "But you still lose if you can't compete in Illinois, Ohio and Michigan." 
 In the end, Mr. Dole decided that he could not afford to neglect Florida, which is a measure of the bind he finds himself in: states that ought to constitute his base, like this one, have still not been nailed down with less than six weeks to go until Election Day. In Florida, according to several polls, the Republican nominee trails President Clinton by 5 to 11 percentage points.
The most reliably Republican of the megastates, with 25 electoral votes, finds itself up for grabs.
Now the question is how large a commitment Mr. Clinton will make here. In 1988, the Democratic nominee, Michael S. Dukakis, closed his Florida headquarters in early September, writing the state off. In 1992, Mr. Clinton did something similar, spending less than $50,000 on television advertising and still losing to George Bush by only 100,000 votes.
"Carrying it this time is a matter of will for the President," said Geoffrey Garin, a Washington consultant with close ties to Florida Democrats. "If he wants to put the resources into the state -- which, of course, means diverting them from other places -- then he will win Florida."
So far, Mr. Clinton seems determined to do so. He has visited the state five times in this year alone, and his campaign recently opened 14 joint regional offices with local candidates. The Democratic National Committee has spent $3.2 million, at last count, on Florida TV commercials. But the test will come in the final couple of weeks, when the competition for dollars gets fierce.
Several local issues appear to be helping Mr. Clinton here, even though the Democrats' once-huge registration lead has dropped steadily with the state's explosive growth, at a rate of 5,000 people a week. Mangrove swamps have become retirement communities, orange groves around Orlando have given way to one of the world's largest resort communities, and the Democrats, who 20 years ago had a 4-to-1 registration edge, now outnumber Republicans only 46 percent to 41.
But many newcomers are retirees -- the state's median age is 38.3, the highest in the nation -- and many are ill-disposed toward Mr. Dole.
"The elderly are afraid," said Richard Sher, a political scientist at the University of Florida. "Their worries about what a Republican administration might do to Social Security and Medicare are real, however bogus the Democrats' charges may be. Clinton has pushed Dole around on that issue, and there has been absolutely no escaping the 'Republicans Slash Medicare' TV ads."
Senator Bob Graham, a Democrat, sees changes in the state's big Hispanic community, concentrated in the south, that could help Mr. Clinton.
"The Hispanics are no longer all from Cuba," he said, "and the ones from Cuba are no longer all Republicans. There has been a significant influx of people from Nicaragua, Colombia, Venezuela and elsewhere in the last few years, many of whom vote Democratic. And the President, by standing up to Fidel Castro lately, has helped blunt the charge that Democrats are soft on Communism."
Republican proposals to tighten immigration, declare English the official language of the United States and withhold certain benefits from legal immigrants have not won Mr. Dole any points among Hispanics, either. Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Republican from the Miami area, not long ago denounced these points on his party's agenda.
A third boost for the President has come from the national Republicans' somewhat ambiguous stand on the environment. A healthy environment, of course, is money in the bank for Florida; it is one of the things that brings tourists and settlers to the state. Local Republicans have taken the lead in defending the Everglades, the Keys and other areas from overdevelopment and pollution.
Nathaniel Reed of Hobe Sound, one of Florida's leading conservationists, epitomizes Republican disarray on the environment. Assistant Secretary of the Interior in the Nixon Administration, he broke with his party in the 1994 race for governor and again this year, and others in his party may follow.
But Mr. Dole's big problems here are his big problems everywhere.
One is the economy. Four years ago, times were tough along the I-4 corridor, named for the Interstate highway linking Tampa to Orlando and Daytona Beach. Defense cutbacks were starting to bite in the high-tech plants spawned by the Kennedy Space Center, retirees in St. Petersburg fretted because their money market funds were paying less interest, and real estate prices were flat.
But as Mr. Dole returned to Florida on Thursday, the state's seemingly inexhaustible boom had resumed in the politically pivotal I-4 corridor and most other places. He complained that the recovery was much too slow, but his words were all but drowned out by word from the Census Bureau that for the first time in six years, family incomes nationwide had risen last year.
A second, even more intractable problem is female voters, which is why Mr. Dole concentrated on meeting them this week in West Palm Beach and Miami.
Robert Joffee of Mason/Dixon Research said his polls showed an enormous gender gap that accounts for Mr. Clinton's entire lead. The President, he said, is trailing Mr. Dole among men, among white non-Hispanic men and even among white non-Hispanic men who describe themselves as independents. But Mr. Dole runs 20 points weaker among women than among men, 31 points weaker among white women than among white men and 47 points weaker among independent white women than among independent white men, Mr. Joffee said.
"For years in this state, we've had white Democratic men -- good ol' boys -- crossing over to vote for Republicans," the pollster added. "That's still happening. But this time, you have just as many if not more Republican women crossing over to the Democrats, joining a lot of independent women."
Four years ago, exit polls showed that the Republican nominee for Governor, Jeb Bush, a son of the former President, lost to Lawton Chiles, the Democratic incumbent, because he could not hold the votes of Republican women. Like Mr. Bush Mr. Dole opposes abortion. And there are strong indications that Republican women here, particularly in suburbs and prosperous retirement communities, continue to resent their party's stand on that issue.
In a swing through the state for a series of articles published last week, Tom Fiedler, the Miami Herald's political editor, found women particularly resistant to Mr. Dole's stand in the Republican-dominated communities along the Gulf Coast from Sarasota to Naples.
Two years ago, many Republican women in that region skipped the governor's race, Mr. Fiedler said.
Tom Slade, the Republican state chairman, said he thought Mr. Dole's message was finally beginning to take hold in the state, and he predicted that as the nominee's advertising campaign got going in earnest, "traction will improve."
But he conceded that abortion was a bugbear, not least because women preoccupied with that issue paid the Republicans no heed on others.
"We need to get them past that," Mr. Slade said. "The reality is that the Supreme Court has settled abortion, and no one can do anything about it as long as we're a nation of laws. We're not going to pass a constitutional amendment banning abortion in 900 years. Pretending otherwise just hurts us."

Speaking yesterday to the nation by radio:
 "He won't tell you that wages for men and women have been stagnant, and that has forced more spouses into the work force just to make ends meet. And he won't tell you that bankruptcies last year were higher than ever before, and so was consumer debt as people struggle to pay their bills. 
 "He also won't tell you that America is experiencing the slowest economic recovery in a century, in large part because of Bill Clinton's tax increase. Nor will he tell you that our trade deficit just jumped 43 percent in one month, reaching a four-year high, and that taxes now account for nearly 40 percent of the average family's household expenses. . . .
"He won't talk about the fact that he cut staffing for the drug czar's office by 83 percent. Or the fact that he cut funds for stopping drugs at our border. Or the fact that he appointed a Surgeon General who suggested legalizing drugs. Or the fact that teen-age drug use has increased by 104 percent during his Administration."

HEADLINE: Rich Nations May Forgive Debt of Poor Nations

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
The world's major industrial powers agreed today to forgive up to 80 percent of the debt owed to them by the poorest nations, primarily in Africa, if those countries agree to extraordinary economic reforms.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said the agreement, reached by the finance ministers of seven large industrial nations, opened the door to the formal endorsement of the plan by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which have issued most of the loans. 
 A senior Administration official said the first beneficiaries would likely be Uganda and Mozambique. But 10 to 15 other countries may ultimately benefit, the official said.
The reforms that will be required include lower trade barriers, privatization of state industries and more openness toward foreign investment.
Italy, Germany and Japan had initially opposed the program, complaining that the cost -- roughly $6 billion -- was too high at a time of tight budgets. But they relented under pressure from the United States and several European nations.
For decades, the world's largest countries have insisted that poor nations repay almost all of their loans. A forgiveness program, they feared, would discourage poor countries from making difficult decisions to reform their economies.
But that policy has made it virtually impossible to convince private companies to invest in poor countries because virtually all the foreign exchange entering those countries was used to pay debts. Clinton Administration officials say they hope the new program will bring at least some private investment, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia.
Oxfam International, a leading private advocate of debt relief, has calculated that the new plan could save Uganda up to $80 million a year over the next three years, enough to pay for health care for 2 million people, teaching materials for 2 million primary school children and immunization for a million children.
At a news conference this evening, Mr. Rubin said the ministers felt that the world economic outlook had improved since the spring and that "conditions appear in place for a strengthening and broadening of the expansion of the world economy into 1997."
He also said the ministers had welcomed the strengthening of the dollar. Last year the Administration was criticized for the dollar's slump.

A Warm Economic Wind

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve decided that the economy was purring along so well -- not too hot, not too cold -- that it would pass up its last chance to raise interest rates before the election.
Later in the week, the Census Bureau reported that the number of poor people in America dropped by more than 1.6 million. Household income rose 2.7 percent, or $898, to $34,074. 
 Mr. Dole noted the dark cloud in the report: People aren't making more, they are just working more jobs. DAVID E. SANGER

HEADLINE: Whose Money? And Whose Problems?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
At a time when the average American family pays more in taxes than it spends on food, shelter and clothing, I find it difficult to believe that anyone would suggest that Americans aren't warranted a real effort at tax reform ("A Reckless Tax Cut," editorial, Sept. 25). Rejecting Bob Dole's plan, you offer no solution to the excessive taxes borne by American families, but conclude with the insipid contention that President Clinton's plan "would do no harm." 
 Moreover, I don't accept your claim that "the economy is now operating at full bore." According to the Commerce Department, the yearly rate of economic growth since Mr. Clinton took office is only 2.5 percent, compared with 3.2 percent the decade before and 4.4 percent in the past five expansions.
Just days before your editorial appeared, the Federal Reserve reported that manufacturing is dropping, along with productivity. The Fed's decision not to raise interest rates is proof that it doesn't see the economy "operating at full bore."
Tax cuts create economic growth. Economic growth creates jobs. Mr. Dole's plan encourages savings, investment and job creation, and it will strengthen America's ability to remain strong in the international economy.

HEADLINE: MINDING YOUR BUSINESS;
59 1/2 Questions About I.R.A. Withdrawals

BYLINE: By BRUCE FELTON 

 BODY:

Q. I'd like to begin withdrawing money from my individual retirement account, but I'm worried about making a mistake and incurring a stiff penalty. Any suggestions?
 
A. Rated for clarity and readability, the rules for I.R.A. distributions rank somewhere between "Finnegans Wake" and a computer repair manual written in Apache. "Even financial advisers who deal with distribution rules day in and day out sometimes have trouble making sense out of them," said Raymond Rogers, head of Distribution Strategies, an I.R.A. consulting firm in Riverside, Conn. 
 But mistakes can be costly. Take out your money even a day too early or too late, or miscalculate the allowable withdrawals, and you could face stinging financial penalties along with unnecessarily high tax bills. In 1993, the most recent year for which figures are available, owners of I.R.A.'s and other tax-privileged retirement plans paid nearly $1.4 billion in such penalties, according to the Internal Revenue Service.
One source of information is I.R.S. Publication 590, which offers a detailed explanation of I.R.A. regulations, including those pertaining to distributions. Free copies are available by calling the agency at (800) 829-3676.
Under I.R.A. tax rules, which vary somewhat from those for other retirement plans, the earliest you can begin tapping your I.R.A. is at age 59 1/2. But that doesn't mean you must or even should withdraw money. "A lot of people wrongly assume they've got to start drawing down their I.R.A. as soon as they become eligible," said Martin Levanthal, head of a New York accounting firm bearing his name. If you're still earning an income at 59 1/2, the best tactic may be to leave your I.R.A. alone and let it continue growing. "Otherwise," he said, "you wind up paying higher taxes on your distributions."
Withdrawing I.R.A. money too early is another problem. Doing so before age 59 1/2 means you will generally have to pay a Federal penalty of 10 percent of the amount withdrawn, on top of income taxes for any money not taxed already. (Some states add a penalty of their own. In California, for example, it is 2.5 percent.) The I.R.S. penalty is waived, however, if the money is needed because of death or disability. Beginning on Jan. 1, it is also waived if you apply the money toward the portion of medical expenses that exceeds 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income, or if you have been collecting unemployment compensation for more than 12 weeks and use the funds to buy medical insurance.
But resist dipping into your I.R.A. for any other reason. "When workers are downsized out of a job, they sometimes feel they have to invade their I.R.A.'s just to meet living expenses," said Joel Isaacson, the head of an accounting and financial planning firm bearing his name in New York. "But there are almost always better alternatives, such as selling off bonds or money market funds, or even borrowing from relatives."
After age 59 1/2, you enter into a sort of I.R.A. utopia, where you are free to withdraw as little or as much as you'd like without penalty, although the payouts, of course, are subject to income taxes. However, once you turn 70 1/2, you have until April 1 of the next year to take your first distribution. If you miss the deadline, or withdraw less than the minimum, you'll face a penalty of 50 percent of the amount you should have withdrawn but didn't.
Nor is delaying that first distribution until the last possible nanosecond necessarily a good idea. Suppose you become 70 1/2 in May and wait till the next year to take your first distribution. Because you must also take a second distribution sometime that same year, you may pay more income tax than if you had made the first withdrawal earlier. You may also squander a key tax benefit with such doubling-up: Most states allow I.R.A. owners a substantial yearly deduction on distributions; in New York, the amount is $20,000. But such deductions are on a per-year -- not per-withdrawal -- basis.
Investors do not have to worry about which of their I.R.A.'s to use. They can take the money from any account, or any combination of them. Thanks to Congress, for the next three years they do not have to worry about the so-called excess distributions rule, either. This summer, Congress temporarily shelved that provision, which imposes a 15 percent tax on withdrawals of more than $155,000 a year.
But I.R.A. owners must still choose between the two ways of computing the minimum annual distribution. Both methods involve dividing the I.R.A. assets by life expectancy, but in one the expectancy is fixed from the outset and in the other it is revised every year.
For example, according to I.R.S. actuarial tables, a person aged 70 1/2 can expect to live another 16 years. Under the "fixed" method, the person would divide the I.R.A. balance by 16 the first year, 15 the second year and so on to figure the minimum withdrawal. With the "recalculation" approach, the same person would have a 16-year life expectancy the first year but a 15.3-year life expectancy the second year.
Because the expected lifespan increases with age, the recalculation method means investors can take out smaller required payouts and stretch them out over a longer period than they can under the fixed approach. If you are concerned about outliving your income, can get by with less money or just want more of your I.R.A. assets to keep growing tax-deferred, recalculation may be right for you.
The fixed method, however, has a tax advantage. If the person using it dies before the I.R.A. is depleted, the beneficiary can continue to receive the payouts according to the original life expectancy. But under the recalculation approach, the whole I.R.A. balance must be paid to the beneficiary in the year after the person's death. That means high taxes.
I.R.A. withdrawals have plenty of other wrinkles; in figuring life expectancy, for instance, you can use just your own remaining years or the joint expectancy of yourself and your beneficiary, with restrictions. But, despite all the twists, negotiate them carefully: Some choices, like the life-expectancy calculation, cannot be changed, even if you pick a new beneficiary -- or a new spouse.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 13, 1996, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, the Minding Your Business column on Sept. 29, about withdrawals from individual retirement accounts, misstated the rules for using the recalculation method of figuring I.R.A. payouts. After an account holder's death, the balance of the account may have to be paid to the beneficiary by the end of the next calendar year, but only under certain conditions: The account holder's age must have been the sole factor in figuring the payout schedule, and the beneficiary must not be the spouse of the account holder.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
The Nanny Track: A Once-Simple World Grown Complicated

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
THE word "nanny" sounds simple -- two little syllables, pronounceable, more or less, by the average 2-year-old. But it comes loaded with complicated associations of class, history, money and love. It conjures up Mary Poppins and the English upper crust and sunny sylvan childhoods. To guilt-burdened modern parents, "day care" sounds institutional, "baby sitter" sounds young and "care giver" dry and emotionless. Nanny sounds warm and comforting, like a big hug.
And semantics is just the beginning. In the 1990's, the nanny business is on a collision course with complication: As the number of working parents has grown, millions of Americans who grew up in middle-class homes without nannies have become employers for the first time, often with no clue to what that means. And as their ranks grow, nannies have begun asserting themselves, demanding to be treated as, well, employees. Office politics can seem like an afternoon of Lego blocks by comparison. 
 What can happen?
* One New York couple was told by their nanny just before a family vacation that she wanted her salary doubled or she would quit. They refused, but then realized that a vacation plane ticket was in the nanny's name and could not be transferred. Off they all went, happily or not.
* One mother who jogged early in the morning instructed her live-in nanny to listen for sounds from the nursery beginning at 6, even though the nanny's formal work day did not begin until 7. The nanny complained to her agency, which agreed that mommy's jog time indeed lengthened the work day. The schedule was adjusted.
* Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his wife, Sara, learned the power of the modern nanny -- not to mention the power of the press -- when their children's sitter, dismissed for burning the soup, painted an unflattering picture of Mrs. Netanyahu. That event has brought waves of anxiety about what is private and what is not in a home with an employee.
The problem of this emerging workplace, nannies, employers and agency owners say, is that there is little agreement on what kind of place it is. In this world, the workers become managers of the house and children after the parents' daily departure and often work under few rules. Parents, reluctant to assert authority as employers but wanting to protect their children, often do not want to admit the change that an employee in the house can bring.
"Millions of professional couples have become employers and 99 percent of them have no idea how to do it," said Lewis Maltby, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's workplace rights office and the employer of a nanny for his two children, ages 4 and 8, at home in Princeton, N.J.
Mary Clurman, co-owner of Apple Pie U.S.A., a nanny agency in Princeton, says both parties in the work relationship keep raising the stakes. Parents insist on older nannies with credentials, then resent the formalization they helped create. Nannies want respect, but mourn the loss of warmth.
"What makes it such an awful business is keeping up with the escalation of expectation -- I feel the follicles of my hair fry several times a day," Ms. Clurman said.
Even without nostalgia, the American nanny business was simpler not so long ago. Compared with that of Britain, where nannies were invented and where formal training has been available for decades, it was smaller, less structured and limited to the most affluent families. Nannies were more likely to be young women looking for a new experience far from home. It was barely a business and hardly a career.
TWO forces have pushed it toward a new place over the last decade. The first, concentrated mainly in the late 1980's, was a growth in demand as birth rates soared for baby boomer couples. Ten years ago, there were about 25 nanny placement agencies in the country, according to Wendy Sachs, president of the International Nanny Association, a group formed in 1986. Now there are more than 500. Estimates of full-time nannies in the United States range from one million to three million.
The second force -- the nanny story of the 1990's -- is the crystallization of that growth into the beginning of an industry. Nannies formed groups. Nanny agencies, paid by employers to find proper nannies, insisted on contracts to protect all parties. Questions arose: When does a nanny's day, and pay, start? Is it possible to protect a family's privacy if a nanny talks to the neighbors or a reporter about embarrassing doings? Can you make a career of nannying?
The new forces have piqued the interest of lawyers and entrepreneurs:
* Auxiliary businesses have sprung up, like the Nanny News, a magazine created four years ago by a New Jersey woman, Vanessa Sandom, who found her own nanny search to be so confused and frustrating that she decided to share what she learned.
* A school in Colorado, the Starkey International Institute for Household Management, is offering a course this fall that may best be called a nanny upgrade. It promises to turn a $300-a-week nanny into a $600-a-week nanny by teaching poise and etiquette. "Some nannies are asking $800 to $1,000 a week, and some are able to get it," said Rita Kirschner, president of the Fox Agency in New York. "Some of our families are willing to pay whatever it takes -- they want a Mary Poppins."
* New legal issues have emerged. The highly publicized nanny troubles of people like Zoe Baird, whose nomination to be Attorney General was withdrawn for failure to pay home employment taxes, have spurred more families to seek advice about legal liabilities and protections. More employers are asking nannies to sign agreements barring them from discussing the doings of the house -- even though, according to Mr. Maltby at the A.C.L.U., such binders are almost certainly unenforceable.
* New technologies have appeared. Companies like Babywatch and In-Home Nanny Surveillance Inc. rent tiny cameras concealed in everything from VCR's to teddy bears. At the Quark Spy Center in New York, 30 to 40 percent of the business comes from renting miniature video cameras to parents who check on life with the baby when they are gone, said Melinda Meals, the vice president of operations and marketing.
Emotions are the undercurrent of all these forces. Nannies who are drawn to the work by the love of children say the anxiety and mistrust they feel from many employers -- especially over the video camera issue -- are creating new walls between them. Parents, easy targets for guilt, say that managing to hire and retain the perfect nanny can, in the end, feel like a defeat.
Carol Chory found such a nanny in Karin Brown. Miss Brown, born and raised in Oklahoma, has a degree in early-childhood development and until recently taught swimming at the local pool in her spare time. She is 33 and has been a stabilizing influence on the sometimes chaotic two-income Chory household in central New Jersey for nearly eight years.
Perfection has its price, though. Mrs. Chory's moment to pay up came two years ago when, arriving home from work, she was approached by her 10-year-old daughter, Cristy, who was eager to read to her a school-assigned essay titled "My Hero." Many of Cristy's classmates were writing about their parents, or big-name athletes. Cristy's hero was Miss Brown. The essays were to be read aloud in school, with the heros and/or parents invited to bask in the glow. Mommy could be there for the proud moment, couldn't she?
"I had to wrestle with it for a while," Mrs. Chory said. But after the initial "moment of shock," she said the essay made her realize how lucky she and the children were. "I wound up feeling very proud," she said.
Donna Palermo of Massapequa, L.I., rented a video camera to check on her nanny earlier this year. What she saw was the nanny ignoring her then 8-month-old daughter, Alexandra, and a friend's child, for almost the whole day without even speaking to them. Ms. Palermo dismissed the nanny and bought the camera for $5,000. She now rents it out herself.
But making sure the nanny cares and does her job well is only the beginning of a sound and secure relationship. Legal experts say that while the tax issues in hiring a domestic employee have drawn the most attention, the rule of thumb is that any nanny employment relationship, whether a contract is signed or not, makes the employer subject to all the rules and entanglements of a small business. If the nanny falls and breaks a leg on the job, she is covered by workers' compensation laws. All medical bills, and salary through recuperation, are the responsibility of the employer.
Though most nannies still work without them, written agreements are probably not a bad idea. Even if they're simple and not drafted by a lawyer, they set boundaries and responsibilities that can prevent conflicts, nannies and parents say.
Federal minimum wage and overtime laws do not apply, but in most states, a wage statute requires a certain minimal pay. Sexual-harassment protection can apply, too. California, for instance, requires a workplace of only one employee for full protection. New York State covers only places of business with at least five employees, though domestic workers in New York City are protected by city statutes, giving them the right to sue for sexual harassment. The Internal Revenue Service recently changed rules for reporting child-care payments, making it easier to catch people in the cash-only part of the economy.
Videotaping without the knowledge of the nanny is generally legal, depending on where the camera is placed and what kind of camera it is. Anywhere in a bathroom or in the nanny's private quarters could invite a sexual-harassment suit. Any camera with a microphone could invite the attention of the F.B.I. because audio recording without consent is a violation of Federal wiretapping laws.
BUT the changes go beyond liability, to definitions of living spaces. If a home becomes a small business when you pay someone to be in it, the lines get blurred. "Now that you have staff walking around your home, is it a private home any more?" said Judith Abranovich, a nanny and co-president of the National Association of Nannies. "It's our office, and I'd like to be treated like any other worker in America."
Some nanny defenders say they believe their children are getting a far better childhood than they would with just a mom around. Ms. Sandon, who founded the Nanny News (recently taken over by Ms. Clurman, the nanny agency owner), said her children were spared her bad moods.
"They get me in a good mood at night, and they get the nanny in a good mood during the day," she said. "If they had to live with me on a full-time basis, they'd die."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 13, 1996, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 29 about the growth of the nanny business misstated the application of minimum-wage laws to nannies' pay. Under the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, live-in nannies are entitled to the minimum wage for their time spent working; they are not covered by the law's overtime provisions, although some states do require overtime pay. Most nannies who do not live in their employers' households are covered by the Federal minimum wage and by the overtime provisions.
The article also misstated the minimum number of employees that a place of business must have before it is covered by New York State and New York City statutes on sexual harassment. It is four, not five.

A Desperate Passion
An Autobiography.
By Helen Broinowski Caldicott.
Illustrated. 366 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $27.50.
 In her most prominent years of anti-nuclear activism, during the 1970's and 80's, Helen Caldicott seemed to some nothing less than a force of nature, a ferocious warrior engaged in a desperate battle to save an endangered planet from the poison of nuclear energy and the world-ending cataclysm of nuclear war. 
 In those same years, Helen Caldicott seemed to others hopelessly naive about geopolitical realities, driven as much by her need for attention and adulation as by her concern for humanity, an unguided missile of misbegotten assumptions and mistaken facts that set back the cause of peace far more than it advanced it. Readers' reactions to her autobiography, "A Desperate Passion," will be shaped, inevitably, by their prior attitudes toward her goals.
 Those who saw Dr. Caldicott, the first president of Physicians for Social Responsibility, as a leader for the good will read her book as the memoirs of a fighter for life and peace who blessed the world through her desperate efforts to save the children she loved as a pediatrician from the ravages of nuclear catastrophe. Those who saw her as a whirling dervish of simplistic anti-nuclear rhetoric unwilling to accept any arguments other than her own will read her book as a confirmation of their worst judgments of her tireless crusade.
 For her own part, Dr. Caldicott, though she may have doubts about the choices she made in life -- choices that she acknowledges resulted in the shortchanging of her own children and her marriage -- expresses few doubts about the virtue of her cause and the consequences of her struggle. She concludes that in the end, "a miracle occurred. The work of the international peace movement helped to pave the way for a Russian, Mikhail Gorbachev, to perform the final act. He sanctioned the collapse of the Berlin wall, and the ever-present tension between the nuclear superpowers dissolved with the disintegration of the Soviet Union. This, I believe, was the single most important event of the 20th century. When the cold war ended, so did my desperation."
 On this point, and on many others, her critics would interpret history quite differently. The enemies she battled for so long -- especially officials in the Reagan Administration who focused American military policy on building what they saw as a necessary shield against a Soviet nuclear threat -- would insist now that it was precisely their strategy, including the Star Wars program against which Dr. Caldicott railed with particular energy, that brought the Soviet Union to economic collapse. They would insist that it was this policy that made Mr. Gorbachev understand that the ideological system used by the Soviet Union to control its population and threaten the world couldn't cope with the challenges imposed on it by a vibrant democracy and economic powerhouse -- one that, despite the efforts of the nuclear freeze movement, succeeded in mounting a military buildup that brought the Soviets to their knees, forcing them, through Mr. Gorbachev, to sue for peace and dismantle their state.
 Though "A Desperate Passion" may inspire Dr. Caldicott's supporters, it won't convert her detractors. More interesting than the defense of her political views, and the description of her efforts on behalf of the anti-nuclear movement, is the account of her journey to that movement's public pinnacle and the struggles, both private and organizational, that she experienced along the way. It was a journey that brought her from Australia to America, from medical work to political activism, from a life as mother and wife to a life as an actor on a very visible international stage, and, more than once, from personal despair to intense exhilaration. Having trained in pediatrics, and having traveled to Harvard Medical School, she was increasingly drawn to the challenge of speaking out against nuclear dangers. When she was 19, she had experienced a presentiment of her anti-nuclear calling in her reaction to "On the Beach," by the Australian novelist Nevil Shute, in which she read of a world doomed by the radiation of a nuclear war. She ultimately helped found Physicians for Social Responsibility and Women's Action for Nuclear Disarmament.
 Dr. Caldicott's life in the anti-nuclear movement wasn't free of disputes. Repeatedly she refers to betrayals by her rivals in Physicians for Social Responsibility and International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (the latter group eventually won a Nobel Peace Prize). Her distress at having been deposed from the presidency of the first group by those rivals, and her sense of them as dishonest and underhanded in their striving for power and recognition, punctuate the book with bitter regularity.
 After the Nobel ceremony, Dr. Caldicott writes, "I felt as if I had been kicked in the guts." Had she given the acceptance speech in 1985 rather than a rival, she writes, she would have used the occasion more effectively. "Looking back through the retrospectoscope," she writes, "I can see that I learned many lessons from these traumatic events. . . . I learned that, to a degree, I had become arrogant, that I needed to encompass humility within the equation of my life -- a difficult lesson to learn at any time, particularly for a physician. I learned that living life as a damaged victim is self-destructive." After subsequent crises and depressions, she felt freed and strengthened.
 One of the criticisms leveled against Dr. Caldicott was that she displayed an excess of passion in her public presentations, which made her message seem, to some, to be based less on facts and reason than on emotion. In her book, she attempts to explain the origins of the passion, and especially the despair, that she frequently felt. But her explanations often seem too simple, too pat, too elusive. Those supporters who have found her to be a force of nature no doubt have a point. But it's a force the full explanation for which a biographer other than herself will some day have to provide.
 Though the danger of nuclear war has not disappeared since Dr. Caldicott worked to diminish it, its nature is quite different. It is now small states, rogue states and terrorist organizations that are most likely to cause nuclear catastrophes, and it will take means other than the organizing passions of Helen Caldicott to protect the planet from their growing threat.

Men and Jobs

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The two big issues in poor black communities are jobs and men. Not enough jobs to go around and not enough men taking enough responsibility for the well-being of their children. The combined effect on the children is hideous. They are sent into the competitive cauldron of the real world grotesquely unprepared. Many do not survive.
I spoke about both issues last week with Geoffrey Canada, president of the Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families, which runs several successful social development programs in New York City. One is the Countee Cullen Community Center in Harlem, which offers year-round counseling, education and recreation as an alternative to the streets for poor youngsters and their parents. 
 "The jobs issue is paramount for communities like central Harlem," said Mr. Canada. "But so many of the jobs, the kind you can get without an awful lot of skills, are gone. So we have young people who start off really excited about work. They're 14, 15, 16 years old and they're out with their working papers knocking on doors, and they find that there are no jobs. They become 17, 18, 19 -- the same thing. No jobs. And after a while the resilient kind of behavior that you need to continue looking can be lost."
Mr. Canada's programs stress the need to improve the academic and other skills of the youngsters, preparing them for college and jobs beyond the entry level. The Harvard sociologist William Julius Wilson, in his new book, "When Work Disappears," writes: "In the new global economy, highly educated and thoroughly trained men and women are in demand. This may be seen most dramatically in the sharp differences in employment experiences among men. Unlike men with lower education, college-educated men are working more, not less."
Said Mr. Canada: "Too many of our children don't have the skills to compete for the better jobs available. They look around for alternatives but there aren't many. People think they end up selling drugs but most do not. Often they just give up. They think, 'There's no way I'm going to make it. I'll go out and try to sell a few tapes on the corner.' They become very marginal in terms of even thinking they can compete in the job market."
The consequences have been dire, but the drastic shortage of employment in the ghettos neither explains nor excuses the mass abandonment of black children by their fathers.
The reluctance in many places to discuss this is understandable. The shame attached to this phenomenon is profound.
"This is increasingly a problem across the country," Mr. Canada said, "but it is an absolutely critical problem in our community."
He quickly went through some of the reasons. "We have an awful lot of young men in jail and lot of them have families. They are locked up at a time when they ought to be bonding with their children. We have a lot of men involved in the underground economy -- sometimes legally, sometimes not -- and they are not spending regular hours in households with their young people. And we have a lot of men, quite honestly, who have never been taught how to be fathers. Many of them never had a father themselves, and no one ever sat down with them and explained to them that these are the things that fathers do -- that you are supposed to be the one who holds your kid's hand and takes your child to school and says I love you and reads the kid a story. Many of our young men never had that and weren't taught that."
Mr. Canada and others like him are trying to undo the damage of many lost years. They are trying to change attitudes and draw as many men as possible back into the family fold.
"Agencies like Rheedlen cannot save children by themselves," he said. "The primary educator of the child, the primary influence on the child, really has to be the parent."
One of the striking things at Countee Cullen is the variety of ways in which young black men are involved in the care of the children in the program. Perhaps it shouldn't be striking, but it is.
"We are trying to bring more men into our children's lives," said Mr. Canada. "We want the kids to have that experience, to know that they can count on men -- not only to be strong, not only for protection, but also to give them a hug, to hold their hand."

Finding What Was Said Back Then and What Now

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

 BODY:
Bill Clinton foresaw the pocketbook election of 1996 during the second Presidential debate of 1992. "You have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit," he said. "You'll have a shot at me in four years, and you can vote me right out if you think I've done a lousy job, and I would welcome you to do that."
In the next debate, he set an even higher bar: "I'd like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan." 
 Those snippets turned up during a simple search for "Clinton and taxes" in a cache of debate transcripts posted on the World Wide Web this month in preparation for the Presidential debates that begin Sunday in Hartford.
The search tool can pluck one answer at a time from 20 Presidential and Vice Presidential debates, going back to John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon in 1960. The Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonpartisan group sponsoring this fall's series, hired Net.capitol Inc., a six-month-old company in Alexandria, Va., to post the 400 to 500 pages on the commission's Web site.
"The debates since 1960 are not as rhetorically rich or powerful or well-crafted," said Mark Kuhn, the commission's Internet communications coordinator. "You also get a sense of the misstatements and repetition when candidates speak without a prompter."
The archives include a clipped, halting Bob Dole, the running mate of President Gerald R. Ford in 1976, sparring with Walter F. Mondale. "So I say, take a look and you'll vote for Ford," Mr. Dole said. His answers are littered with "uh" and "(cough)" notations.
But Mr. Dole's answers also indicate that this fall's debate will not be devoid of humor even if, as seems possible, Ross Perot is absent. Mr. Dole said, of his 50 percent rating from that debate's hosts, the League of Women Voters, "Either I was wrong half the time or they were wrong half of the time."
Mr. Perot, the Reform Party nominee, stole the show during the 1992 debates, but, barring a court's intervention, won't be there this year. Those who miss him can find consolation by tapping into the Perot '96 site and reading unabridged versions of Mr. Perot's protests, including a 14-page lawsuit filed in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, and a 10-page complaint to the Federal Communications Commission.
The site operated by the Commission on Presidential Debates includes a seven-point guide, "How to get the most out of a debate," which encourages viewers to consider the candidates' strategies while watching and warns about reaction shots that distract from the candidates' words.
The inquisitive also can find the commission's guidelines for selecting debate locations. Each participating city was required to pay $500,000 to the commission. The halls were to have a minimum ceiling height of 35 feet, air-conditioning maintained at 70 degrees, and "comfortable, fully padded seats with unobstructed views of the stage."
A companion site is Debate Watch '96, based at the University of Kansas, the debate commission's citizen-involvement program. After each debate, the program will sponsor discussions in living rooms, schools and libraries and the results are to be posted on the Web. The site includes instructions for on-line discussions.
Sites in each of the three host cities have opened debate sections. The Current, the electronic edition of The Hartford Courant, plans to broadcast sound from Sunday's debate over the Web as well as commentary from three "cyberpundits."

HEADLINE: Costa Rica Chafes at New Austerity

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Costa Rica

 BODY:
For nearly half a century, Costa Rica has had a reputation as "the Switzerland of Central America." With no army and a stable, democratic political system, the 3.5 million people of this mountainous country have grown accustomed to a standard of living that has made them the envy of Latin America, with benefits that include free education and health care.
But now that European-style welfare state is being dismantled by the son of the man who created it. Faced with huge deficits and a creaky Government bureaucracy that at its peak accounted for one of every six jobs, President Jose Maria Figueres is slashing away at the traditional system of cradle-to-grave protections and warning his people of continued austerity ahead. 
 "The people of Costa Rica must understand that, in the words of the only Milton Friedman phrase I ever use, there is no free lunch," said Leonardo Garnier, the Minister of Planning and Economic Policy. "If I don't pay now, I have to pay later."
Since taking office two years ago, Mr. Figueres, a 41-year-old graduate of West Point, has trimmed the Government payroll, undone the state's banking monopoly and shut down a Government railroad. He has agreed to sell some state enterprises and to allow private investment in others. At the same time, his Government has raised taxes, lowered tariffs and reformed a pension system once renowned for its generosity.
"It's not the same country anymore," said Victor Perez Mora, 54. A printer who worked for the National Lottery for 22 years until accepting a buyout offer in 1995, he now says he has to scrimp because the Government has fallen behind on payment of his retirement benefits. "Costa Rica always had a certain mystique, but now that is gone," he said.
It began in 1948, when Jose Figueres, known as Don Pepe, led a brief rebellion that resulted in the abolition of the military and installation of democratic rule. Once in power, Mr. Figueres and the National Liberation Party established state monopolies in areas like banking and utilities and set out to win the loyalty of voters by providing a network of social services with almost no fees.
The origins of the current crisis can be traced back to the 1970's, when Costa Rica borrowed heavily abroad to support the social safety net, building up a foreign debt that has soared in this decade to more than $4 billion. The day of reckoning was postponed throughout the 1980's by more than $1 billion in aid from the United States, which was alarmed by the emergence of left-wing, anti-American Governments in neighboring Nicaragua and Panama.
With the cold war's end, though, Costa Rica was largely left to fend for itself, and turned so heavily to borrowing on local markets that interest payments now swallow 30 percent of the budget. Two months ago, Washington closed its aid mission here, saying Costa Rica has "achieved a wholly sustainable economy" and should no longer be considered a developing country.
Compared with the rest of Latin America, living standards here are still at an enviable level, with an average life expectancy of 76 years, a literacy rate of 94 percent and a per capita income double that of the regional average. The United Nations' most recent Human Development Index puts Costa Rica ahead of Asian "tigers" like Singapore and even above some Western European countries, like Portugal.
But the current retrenchment has made Mr. Figueres Costa Rica's most unpopular President of modern times and led to accusations that he is betraying the principles of his father and their party, which is a member of the Socialist International.
According to a recent poll, only 12 percent of those surveyed think he is doing a "good or very good" job. Some 54 percent considered his performance to be "poor or very poor."
"I voted for him because I thought that being the son of Don Pepe, he would do good things," said Grace Castillo, who is trying to make a living running a small bakery after being laid off from her secretarial job. "But I am completely disgusted. He never tells the truth and cares nothing about us down below."
In late August, violence erupted in the Caribbean port of Limon after the Government announced a plan, likely to lead to layoffs and lost benefits, to allow private investment in the country's ports, airports and railroads. Three people were reported killed in the disturbances, unusual here, 78 people hurt and stores, warehouses and restaurants looted.
Government workers, who have had to bear the brunt of the belt-tightening, have been especially vociferous in their complaints about Mr. Figueres. But it is the perceived weakening of the education and health systems that seems to alarm Costa Ricans most.
"When I was a child, there was abundance," Ms. Castillo, 37, said. "At school, they gave us free milk, vaccinations, vitamins, even dental service. But now the idea of a truly free education has passed into history, and we parents pay not just for books, but even for the chalk."
At hospitals, the situation is much the same, with patients increasingly being told they must wait months to see a specialist. Many people tell stories of having to go on their own to pharmacies to buy medicines and supplies that the hospitals treating them no longer have.
The Government acknowledges that the social safety net is deteriorating. But officials say the decline is not a result of their policies but of years of lavish spending and they are acting now to prevent further erosion and to protect what is left.
"This Government is not so skilled as to be able to destroy all this so rapidly," Francisco de Paula Gutierrez, an American-trained economist who became Minister of Finance in July said, mocking an argument that is heard frequently here. "This is not something that happened overnight, but a process of accumulation over 15 or 20 years."
The international aid agencies and foreign economic analysts agree and say the retrenchment was long overdue. "They were living beyond their means," said one such expert. "Figueres should be given credit for making a lot of long-term decisions that are going to have good effects."
There are indications that the situation will get worse before it gets better. The 1997 budget, which is now being considered by the Legislative Assembly, calls for cuts of up to 28 percent in spending by ministries like those that deal with housing, health, culture and the environment.
"We don't think this plague is going to end any time soon," said Rigoberto Ulloa of the National Association of Public Employees, a union of Government workers. "The Government calls it the modernization of public services, but we consider it a way to fire workers and weaken public institutions."
Increasingly, those with money are turning to doctors in private practice, sending their children to private schools, and hiring private security guards for protection.
"The mechanisms of social integration are deteriorating, and the possibilities of social segregation are growing," said Carlos Sojo, a researcher at the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences. "More and more, we have one system for those who can afford to pay, and another for those who cannot."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE GRASS ROOTS;
In Ohio, the Campaign Is Just Now Gearing Up

SERIES: AN AMERICAN PLACE: Up Close and Political

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 29

 BODY:
To read the major newspapers and watch television, the race for President is over, with Bill Clinton easily being re-elected in the polls. Even the Doonesbury comic strip's Presidential character, the White House waffle, has started looking ahead to what it is going to be like as a second-term lame duck.
Yet here in middle America, where the citizenry still goes through the formality of voting in November, the real political push has not even begun and will not for a couple of weeks. 
 "The heavy lifting is the last three weeks," said Don Singer, head of the local Job Training Partnership agency, who is running the Clinton campaign in Stark County. "This is a place with a lot of independent voters who make up their minds right at the end." Mr. Singer does not expect to receive his computer printout of 150 swing precincts from state Democratic headquarters in Columbus until mid-October.
The Stark Republican chairman, Charles Brown, still has not made up his mind where to put the campaign's get-out-the-vote telephone bank. "Somewhere where we'll be able to call all over the county with the fewest long-distance calls," he said.
As for the Perot organization, the other day a reporter called Al Coppock, a supporter, to find out who was directing the Perot effort in this county of 370,000 residents. "It's really just a group of us who call ourselves volunteers," he said. "I'll get back to you."
He called back three hours later to say, "The group has decided that, I guess, I should be the spokesperson." The Perot campaign will not have a headquarters here ("just an answering machine in someone's house," Mr. Coppock said). Nor did it in 1992, holding meetings at the public library. Nor was that a serious handicap.
In 1992, Mr. Perot got 25 percent of the vote in Stark County. He collected 21 percent of the state vote without making a single campaign appearance in Ohio.
To watch a Presidential election take shape in a place like Stark, the seventh most populous county among 88 counties in this crucial swing state, is to be reminded that the vast amount of information and politicking descends upon the citizenry from faraway places.
The Democrats' and Republicans' Presidential commercials and the Perot infomercials are all nationally generated and are watched by Cantonians on cable television tuned to Cleveland stations. (There is no commercial television in Canton). National political television news comes from the networks, CNN, C-Span. (The local television news from Cleveland is basically crime, the weather, The TRIBE! and the winning Pick 4 state lottery number).
Canton's newspaper, The Repository, relies primarily on The Associated Press for national political coverage. Commentary on WHBC, the local radio station, comes from conservative syndicated programs, including three hours of Rush Limbaugh daily and reports by Paul Harvey, who recently used a large portion of his newscast to say that even with Alzheimer's, Ronald Reagan would be a better President than Bill Clinton.

Still a Brawl In the County
The Clinton campaign leaders here like Mr. Singer know the national and state poll numbers and are confident they are ahead. The latest statewide poll, released today by the University of Akron, has the President ahead by 13 points. But the Stark Democrats also feel the pressure because they are the ones who have to deliver, because they realize the problem for Democrats is always getting their voters out, and they are aware how few voters can make a difference in a county like Stark and a state like Ohio.
Mr. Clinton carried Stark County by 40-to-35 percent over George Bush in 1992, almost exactly his national spread. But in Stark, with Mr. Perot getting so many votes, that five-point spread was only an 8,021-vote difference, less than half the people who attend the annual McKinley versus Massillon high school football game here.
Stark Republicans realize they are behind, but they believe they have a chance, and Alfred Tuchfarber for one, who oversees the Ohio Poll for the University of Cincinnati, thinks the party could still do it. Last spring, Mr. Clinton led in Stark and statewide polls by high double digits; the Ohio Poll, taken in mid-September, shows him leading by nine points.
Four years ago at this time, Mr. Clinton was ahead of Mr. Bush in the Ohio Poll by eight points, and in the end, Mr. Clinton barely carried Ohio, winning by less than two percentage points. Ohio is both a strong bellwether -- missing only twice for President in 100 years -- and Ohio is hard on Democrats. The last Democrat before Mr. Clinton to carry Ohio for President was the last previous Democratic President, Jimmy Carter, who won by just 11,000 out of 4.1 million votes cast in 1976.
As the Republicans have pulled back resources in states they feel Mr. Dole cannot win, like California, they have upped the ante in places like Ohio that he must win. Mr. Dole has made eight campaign stops in the state, three in the last six weeks, and he is to return to Ohio on Tuesday. Last week the Dole campaign spent $350,000 on television advertising in Ohio, well above what Democrats had expected.
Those commercials have mainly been attacks on Mr. Clinton's drug-enforcement policy, hitting the President where he is most vulnerable, on character issues. They seem to resonate here a lot more than the earlier Republican commercials, which focused on Mr. Dole's pledge to cut Federal taxes by 15 percent.
Even many Republicans here question the wisdom of Mr. Dole's tax proposal, when the latest unemployment rate for Stark is 4.4 percent, half of what it was four years ago, and when the biggest employer, the Timken Company, is posting record profits, opening new operations in China, increasing its research budget by 15 percent and announcing it will spend $55 million to renovate its Harrison steel plant here.
On the other hand, one of the big local news stories the last few months has been the growing presence of gangs and drug use in county schools. Two weeks ago, more than 100 Stark community leaders met in the courthouse downtown for a Gang Summit to discuss the problem. And while there were people from the cities and suburbs, blacks and whites, it was primarily white Republican suburban leaders running the show, including Common Pleas Judge Lee Sinclair of Louisville, Ohio, and the president of the county commission, John P. Dougherty of Jackson, Ohio, men from the very places where Mr. Dole must win big if he is to carry Stark.
"In Ohio," Mr. Tuchfarber said. "I see anything from a 3-to-4 point Dole win to an 8-point Clinton win."

From Big Business, Big G.O.P. Money
Throughout the year, the Stark Democrats and Republicans have held old-fashioned picnics, Swiss steak dinners, chili cook-offs, hamburger helpers, golf outings, candidates' nights -- in short, modest-sized affairs that cost $10 to $25 a ticket and give the local candidates and the parties some exposure. Mr. Brown, the Republican chairman, likens the local political activity to a parade that is off in the distance for most people but is just noisy enough so the citizenry has a vague sense that when the time comes, the appropriate entourage will march by.
The time comes in mid-October, with phone banks to pinpoint support, literature drops to signal the arriving moment and squads of drivers to deliver the vote.
It is striking, too, that with all that has been written nationally about the changing face of party politics, in Canton, the financial and volunteer backbone of the two major parties continues to look like a Herblock political cartoon: Republicans in their top hats versus Democrats in their hard hats, with "Business" and "Labor" stenciled across their chests.
Executives of the Timken steel and roller-bearing company and Timken family members continue to be the largest local contributors to Republicans, as they have for most of this century. In the last year, 43 Canton residents who identified themselves as Timken employees on campaign forms made $189,325 in political contributions -- every penny of it to Republicans, according to a computer search of Federal election records by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research organization.
Setting the tone for Timken executives is W. R. (Tim) Timken Jr., 57, the chairman of the Timken Company, and a Dole supporter who says he has never knowingly voted for a Democrat. Mr. Timken and his immediate family gave $100,000 to the Republican National Committee this year, as has been their custom in recent Presidential elections.
Mr. Brown, the Stark Republican chairman, complains that the state Democratic Party pays for the Clinton headquarters here, while the county Republicans have to raise their money locally. That is less of a problem than it sounds, thanks to the Timken Company. In the last year, 30 Timken executives (none of them Timken family members) contributed a total of $50,750 to the Stark Republican Party.
Longtime Timken executives say that in the same sense that it is part of the Timken corporate culture to be involved in community volunteer efforts like the United Way and Football Hall of Fame Week, there is an expectation that top corporate managers will take an active interest in the Republican Party.
Mr. Timken's grandfather, H. H. Timken, was a $5,000 contributor to the Republican National Committee in 1918 and the fourth generation Timken to run the company is not one who believes in ticket splitting. "You have to look at the two parties and ask, 'Which am I?' " Mr. Timken said in an interview earlier this year. "If you agree with 80 percent of what the Republicans say, then you vote Republican. I don't agree with the people who say, 'I vote for the person.' A Democrat here, a Republican here, they cancel themselves out."
People here refer to Timken, which employs 6,000 people in Canton and 17,000 worldwide, as a Republican company. There are Timken executives as well as executives working for companies doing business with Timken who say privately they are voting for Mr. Clinton this time, but would not let their names be used. Last month, a Timken manager approached a reporter at the county fair and was eager to be interviewed until he realized some of the questions being asked were political. "If you used my name and said I was for Clinton, it could affect my future," he said.
Mr. Timken says that would not happen. "You don't have to be a Republican to work here," he said. "We have Democrats who work here." But he also said: "You have to look at which of the parties has the philosophy to benefit the economy and enterprise. It's no wonder that so many people, not only at the Timken Company, but business in general, believe in the philosophy of the Republican Party."

Labor's Donations Go to Democrats
On the Democrat side, local union contributions are harder to pinpoint because the money is distributed by labor leadership on the state level, but the link is unmistakable. In 1994, labor unions contributed a total of $2.8 million to candidates in Ohio's statewide and legislative races, with $2.6 million of it going to Democrats, according to a study by the Citizens Policy Center and the Kiplinger Reporting Program at Ohio State. In Ohio, the four biggest organizational contributors to state races in 1994 were all unions, representing teachers, automobile workers, government workers, as well as the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
The Clinton re-election headquarters in Stark, which opened Sept. 14, shares a building with two other major tenants, the steelworkers' union and teachers' union. The person who will put together much of the plan to deploy volunteers for the Democrats in Stark's 150 swing precincts is John Mroczkowski, regional director of the United Steelworkers' union here.
The Democrats say they will need 170 volunteers out in the precincts doing mail drops. "We count on the unions heavily for volunteers," said John Ferrero, the Democratic Party county chairman.
Mr. Dole has repeatedly ridiculed the teachers' unions as enemies of education reform, and the local chapter presidents are out in force reminding members that the Ohio Education Association, their union, has endorsed Mr. Clinton.
Mark Mathieu, a union president in a suburban district known as Canton Local, is holding weekly after-school meetings with teachers at each of the district's five buildings. "I tell them, 'Your future is at stake on a lot of these issues,' " said Mr. Mathieu, a Republican who is voting for Mr. Clinton this time.
The labor rank-and-file vote is not the monolithic Democratic vote it once was and Democrats acknowledge a surprisingly large number of union members here voted for Mr. Perot in 1992. In a poll taken in Stark in May by The New York Times with Ohio State University and the Northwestern University's Survey Laboratory, 52 percent of the union members interviewed indicated they voted for Mr. Clinton in 1992, 20 percent said they voted for Mr. Bush and 26 percent said they voted for Mr. Perot.
With Perot's appeal diminished this year, the Democrats are pushing hard to recapture that union vote. Jim Repace, president of the 2,000-member electrical workers' local at the Hoover Company, voted for Mr. Perot in 1992, but is behind Mr. Clinton this time, he says. His support for the Democratic President has grown as his local union's relationship with Hoover management has gone from amicable to miserable in recent months. Last summer, the company decided to move its new line of upright vacuums to El Paso, Tex., where nonunion workers will earn $7.50 an hour, half the hourly wage here.
Mr. Repace has been inviting political speakers to the monthly union meetings with hopes that the battle with Hoover management would motivate the membership to action, but he is not so sure. "I'm telling you, I'm not getting the response I'd like to have," he said. "We're getting the normal amount to the meetings."
At the opening of Clinton headquarters here, Harold Roach, the former Stark County Treasurer, whose son Mark is the current County Treasurer, delivered in 15 seconds that age-old message the Democrats will be pushing to win over voters in all the nation's Cantons these next few weeks.
"I saw in the paper Timken roller bearing is spending $55 million on remodeling," he said, "We know how strong Timmy Timken is a Republican. We got to remind people he made that money on a Democratic economy."
 
An American Place
Living midway between Democratic Cleveland and Republican Columbus, the citizens of Canton, Ohio, and surrounding Stark County have a history of voting for the winning Presidential candidate. This is the 27th article in a yearlong series that explores the forces shaping the political debate at the grass roots.

On Workfare, Fig Leaves And Silence

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
"Nothing in this subsection shall preempt or supersede any provision of state or local law that provides greater protection for employees from displacement."
Section 407(f)(3) of the new Federal welfare legislation, which deals with workfare. 
 DOES anybody read these days?
Because anyone who actually has read the new welfare law might make a surprising discovery: the same section that sanctions the replacement of unionized workers with unsalaried welfare recipients also gives local governments the means to limit that same practice.
But Stanley Hill, leader of New York City's largest municipal union, has not called on New York to pass a protective law; he wants the Federal law amended. And anyway, "politicians can mess around with laws," he said over the weekend. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has not proposed that the city or state pass its own law either, though he says he objects to hiring replacement workers and is furious with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority because it plans to replace 500 cleaners who leave through attrition with welfare recipients. The City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said yesterday that he asked his staff to look into the matter of a local law just last week and nobody in Albany has said a public word about it.
It is always possible that, the law being the size of the Manhattan telephone book, few have gotten as far as Section 407. More likely, the silence is deliberate because there is little support for a stricter local law. It would constrain unions and government, and they need all the flexibility they can get.
THE reality is that barring a resurgent economy, there simply are not enough low-skilled jobs around for both union workers and welfare recipients. So labor leaders are protecting their members -- and therefore their standing in their unions -- by extracting no-layoff pledges from City Hall, as Mr. Hill did for his union, District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. And by agreeing not to lay off any union workers, Mr. Giuliani and other politicians keep the cooperation of labor leaders -- who control many a vote -- even if workfare spawns a cheap work force.
Some contend it already has and that under the welfare law, that phenomenon will grow. City officials predict that in a few years, 100,000 welfare recipients will have to go into the city's workfare program, which now numbers 35,000. How many will get real jobs? A hint came last week, after Mr. Hill staged his quicksilver rebellion and demanded a moratorium on workfare; the Mayor promised to find permanent city jobs for those in workfare -- but only about 1,000. The city has 204,000 employees.
The point is, with the new law mandating ever more workers from the welfare ranks, workers with little skill and experience will be scrambling for the same jobs. What looms is an unpleasant, no-win competition between the poor on welfare and the poor not on welfare.
The Mayor says the city's workfare workers are doing only "supplementary" work -- in former union jobs abandoned because of budget cuts. But definitions are loose. For instance, how long does a task have to be neglected before it becomes "supplementary?" A year? Two years? Five?
From the beginning, the debate about workfare in New York City has centered on its value to recipients and to the city, not its effect on unions. Because from the beginning there was an unspoken understanding that welfare workers could become unofficial replacement workers, despite curbs on workfare in the state social services law.
NOW the new Federal welfare act expressly states that governments "may fill a vacant employment position" with a welfare worker as long as there were no layoffs. City Hall started its program long before the President signed the bill, getting around some constraints on workfare by labeling the work supplementary, and now that is no longer necessary.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's tentative agreement with its union -- subject to approval by rank-and-file members and Mayor Giuliani -- removes the fig leaf, as one critic put it. The agency would drop 500 jobs through attrition (no layoffs), welfare recipients working for their benefits would fill those jobs, and then an unspecified number might be hired as permanent, salaried employees.
"The reality is, the fig leaf was going to disappear anyway," said Marc V. Shaw, executive director of the authority. "This is the next step, the new and improved workfare program because people doing it will have a shot at jobs. That issue is out there, and this is the answer."
The city or the state could make his deal impossible by enacting a new law. But if prevented from using welfare workers, government might again have to expand its labor force, something it contends it cannot afford.
So Section 407(f)(3) gets the silent treatment, which in one way is a shame: invoking it would at least generate a debate, force union leaders and politicians to level with the public about laws, fig leaves -- and reality.

HEADLINE: Patents;
A dispute over prepaid college tuition programs turns into a full-blown constitutional debate.

BYLINE: By Teresa Riordan 

 BODY:
IT'S rare that a patent dispute raises constitutional issues. But an infringement dispute over prepaid tuition programs has just erupted into a full-blown battle over how heavily a state can tread on the commercial rights of an individual.
Since the late 1980's, many parents have been funneling their savings into prepaid tuition programs, which index their returns to college inflation rates. Peter A. Roberts, who is the chairman of College Savings Bank of Princeton, N.J., and was granted a pioneering patent covering a computerized version of the concept in 1988, contends that some states, chief among them Florida, have stolen his idea and are infringing on his patent as they run similar businesses. 
 Earlier this month the Justice Department intervened, filing briefs on behalf of the College Savings Bank in its lawsuit in Federal District Court in Trenton against the Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board. Oral arguments on a motion to dismiss the suit are scheduled for Nov. 4.
"The question here is whether states, as they move more and more into competition with private business, ought to be treated like other people or whether they are to be completely unaccountable," said Herman Schwartz, a professor of constitutional law at American University in Washington.
A prepaid tuition program does not offer astounding returns. "The key feature is that it guarantees to meet the future cost of college," Mr. Roberts said. "Because it is backed by the F.D.I.C., it eliminates the risk that money market accounts or bonds would have."
College Savings Bank has about 12,000 accounts and $95 million in deposits, while the Florida program, the largest in the nation, has more than $1 billion.
Kevin J. Culligan, Mr. Roberts's lawyer and a partner at the New York firm of Fish & Neave, said Florida relied on Mr. Roberts's input while putting together its own program. "First they picked his brains, then they picked his pockets," Mr. Culligan said.
Because of the 11th Amendment to the Constitution, which largely indemnifies states from being sued by individuals in Federal court, Mr. Roberts traditionally would have had no recourse against Florida or any other state that he believed had infringed his patent. But in 1992, Congress revised the patent and trademark laws to allow individuals to sue states for trespassing on their intellectual property.
For its part, Florida denies that it is infringing Mr. Roberts's patent. In a brief filed in April, Florida contended that "Congress lacks the power to abrogate the state's 11th Amendment immunity to such claims." And then in a brief filed last week Florida argued that a recent Supreme Court ruling, Seminole Tribe v. Florida, negated the Congressional act of 1992. Robert G. Shepherd, one of the lawyers Florida has hired in New Jersey and a partner with Mathews, Woodbridge & Collins in Princeton, said he could not comment on the case.
Professor Schwartz, who is not involved in the College Savings litigation, disagreed with Florida's interpretation of the Seminole decision, calling the decision "dreadful" and saying it was "unclear" on the question of the 11th Amendment.
Meanwhile, Mr. Roberts has other worries. In August Congress passed a new law, originally introduced by Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, that exempts state-sponsored tuition plans from tax and also defers taxation of earnings for investors.
"I expect an explosion in the growth of these programs run by states," Mr. Roberts said. "That tax break is a tremendously unfair advantage for them."
The patent under dispute is 4,722,055.

A New Method Of Gene Sequencing
Mutations in the gene known as p53 have been linked with all manner of cancers, including those of the colon, lung and breast. Since such mutations have been associated with particularly aggressive forms of these cancers, a patient's course of treatment can depend on whether such an aberration is found.
Testing can be expensive, though, costing $500 to $1,000. Because the gene might be mutated in hundreds of different ways, inexpensive genetic probes, which search and find bits of DNA identical to themselves, are ineffective. Instead, the gene must be sequenced -- transcribed, essentially, into DNA building-block letters -- so that it can be proofread for errors.
Visible Genetics Inc. of Toronto this month patented what it says can be a speedier and significantly less expensive method for sequencing p53.
Instead of sequencing the entire gene or a big chunk of it, Visible Genetics first screens it using an existing crude test like fragment analysis.
"By using the crude test we narrow the mutation down to a specific part of the gene," said John K. Stevens, chairman of Visible Genetics. "Then we can sequence just that area."
But because the preliminary test is so imprecise, a complete sequencing must be done when it fails to find a possible area of mutation.
"We're not necessarily more accurate than anyone else," Mr. Stevens said. "But because we have to do less sequencing, we end up with a much less expensive test."
Mr. Roberts said that because the process combined existing techniques, "most people when they read this patent shake their head and say, 'No way you could get a patent on this'; but nobody had ever thought to put these two things together for a diagnostic test."
Visible Genetics received patent 5,545,527.
 
Have Business Card, Will Tee Off
Robert J. Veylupek and George Wallace Jr. of Las Vegas, Nev., have patented a "combination business card golf tee."
The golf tee is formed when a perforated tab is locked into an opening at one end of the card. "The tee comprises the card in an arched form, with the ends of the card acting as legs for the tee, and the absence of the body portion of the tab forming a saddle elevated above the ground into which the ball may be placed," the patent states.
Mr. Veylupek and Mr. Wallace received patent 5,503,396.
Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. and World Bank Clear Debt Relief

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
With the world economy apparently in position to grow steadily and low inflation predicted for the next four years, finance ministers from rich and poor countries today formally endorsed a new plan to lighten the debt burden of the poorest nations.
Under this plan, which the Group of Seven industrial powers agreed to on Saturday and formally approved today, creditor nations stand ready to forgive these countries about 25 percent of their debts, once they have started to develop free-market economies favorable to private enterprise and foreign investment. 
 The calculations assume that up to 80 percent of eligible debts will be forgiven. For creditor governments and banks, only the debt incurred before the mid-1980's will be eligible for this relief in most cases.
But all debt owed to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank -- agencies that started lending to poor countries 15 years ago, after a wide debt crisis cut off the flow of government and private loans -- will be eligible for relief under the plan.
The agreement represents a breakthrough in dealing with deeply indebted nations, most of them in Africa, because it raises the level of forgiveness that creditors will offer to well above the 67 percent ceiling now, and for the first time wipes out debts owed to international aid agencies. It comes at a time the economic outlook for industrial nations is relatively hopeful, giving them both the incentive and the opportunity to turn their attention to the poorer countries.
The I.M.F. predicts that worldwide growth will pick up to an average annual rate of 4.5 percent between 1998 and 2001 -- significantly above the 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth averaged over the last 25 years.
At the same time, the currency markets have been tamer, leading the American Secretary of the Treasury, Robert E. Rubin, to remark that this year's Group of Seven foreign-exchange review "was not of the kind we had a year ago," when the Clinton Administration was under fire over a sharp slump in the dollar's value.
Heavy debt burdens, and their associated costs, can stifle growth in the poorest developing countries, leaving them unattractive to foreign investors, I.M.F. officials stress. The aim of the relief plan is to help these countries achieve a sustainable debt burden -- 200 percent to 250 percent of their annual export earnings.
Oxfam, an international-development charity that advocates debt relief, calculates that this could save Uganda -- likely to be among the first countries to receive help -- as much as $80 million annually over the next three years. The East African nation's export earnings last year were about $600 million; its total debt is $3.4 billion.
That saving would provide enough money for basic health services for as many as two million people, immunize a million children and buy teaching material for two million primary-school pupils.
Some 20 countries are considered to have unsustainable or possibly unsustainable debt burdens -- including Zaire, Zambia, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Madagascar and Tanzania.
These countries' total debts, both those eligible and ineligible under the new relief plan, are estimated at $97 billion. Of this, 58 percent is owed to creditor governments, 22 percent to international institutions and 14 percent to foreign banks.
Governments would simply write off their loss. The World Bank's president, James D. Wolfensohn, said he would allocate $2 billion from future profit for debt relief, and the I.M.F. is asking its members for contributions, but is ready to sell some of its gold supply if these steps prove insufficient.
While the debt-relief plan represents the only tangible achievement of this year's World Bank and I.M.F. meetings, Secretary Rubin has presented it as part of a broader attempt to preserve growth and world financial stability by guarding against new Mexican-style crises.
He described the debt plan as one of a series of measures decided on in principle by the Group of Seven at their heads of government meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia. These included instructing the I.M.F. to tighten surveillance of member nations' economies to spot crises in the making; encouraging nations to provide more information about their financial health; strengthening regulation of international markets, and new plans to increase the amount of money the I.M.F. can offer countries in distress.
Other potentially troublesome aspects of the world economy were discussed in the weekend conference. Of these, Mr. Rubin has said he now expects Japan to maintain the recovery in domestic demand that seems to be under way, providing an expanding market for foreign goods.
Another worry is whether Europe's plan to start its single-currency plan in 1999, and the attendant race to cut national budget deficits, means that growth forecasts for the Continent may be too optimistic.

National Security Experts Plan for Wars Whose Targets and Weapons Are All Digital

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
It was the OPEC meeting in May 2000 that started the crisis. The oil-price hawks, led by Iran, demanded a sharp cutback in production to drive prices up to "at least $60 a barrel."
The stormy gathering of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ended on May 4, with a shouting match between the Iranian and Saudi Arabian oil ministers. Over the next two weeks, Iran and its allies mobilized troops and fired on Saudi warships. But they also unleashed an arsenal of high-technology weapons to try to destabilize the Saudi Government and prevent the United States from intervening. 
 A huge refinery near Dhahran was destroyed by an explosion and fire because of a mysterious malfunction in its computerized controls. A software "logic bomb" caused a "new Metro-Superliner" to slam into a misrouted freight train near Laurel, Md., killing 60 people and critically injuring another 120. The Bank of England found "sniffer" programs running amok in its electronic funds transfer system. And a "computer worm" started corrupting files in the Pentagon's top-secret force-deployment data base.
The opening scenes from a Hollywood script or a new Tom Clancy novel? No, these are excerpts from a role-playing game conducted last year at the Government's National Defense University in Washington. The goal was to generate some serious thinking about "information warfare."
Today, there are a lot of people thinking seriously about information warfare, not only at the Pentagon and the C.I.A. but also in the executive offices of banks, securities firms and other companies. Once dismissed as the stuff of science fiction, high-tech information warfare is fast becoming a reality.
Military and intelligence officials believe that enemy nations, terrorists and criminal groups either already have the capability to mount information warfare strikes or soon will. Criminals are quickly progressing beyond the vandalism and petty theft associated with teen-aged hackers and into robbery and extortion schemes ranging up to millions of dollars, corporate executives and private investigators say.
In the future, they fear, information warfare assaults could be made against commercial networks like the banking system or utilities in several states.
Yet there is a heated debate among experts in this emerging field about whether the kinds of catastrophic incidents cited in the National Defense University war game are imminent threats or worst-case nightmares.
"A couple of years ago, no one took information warfare seriously," said Howard Frank, director of the information technology office at the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, or Darpa. "But the more you learn about it, the more concerned you become."
Others reply that the worst threats mentioned are mostly speculation. "Information warfare is a risk to our nation's economy and defense," said Martin Libicki, a senior fellow at the National Defense University. "But I believe we will find ways to cope with these attacks, adjust and shake them off, just as we do to natural disasters like hurricanes."
Experts on both sides of the debate do agree that the growing reliance on computer networks and telecommunications is making the nation increasingly vulnerable to "cyberattacks" on military war rooms, power plants, telephone networks, air traffic control centers and banks.
John M. Deutch, the Director of Central Intelligence, told Congress in June that such assaults "could not only disrupt our daily lives, but also seriously jeopardize our national and economic security."
"The electron, in my view," Mr. Deutch warned, "is the ultimate precision-guided weapon."
President Clinton created a Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in July to craft a coordinated policy to deal with the threat. Within the Government, information warfare tactics and intelligence are highly classified issues. But the C.I.A. has recently created an Information Warfare Center. And the National Security Agency intends to set up an information warfare unit staffed by as many as 1,000 people, with both offensive and defensive expertise, as well as a 24-hour response team, according to a staff report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The report was initiated by Senator Sam Nunn.
Information warfare is a catch-all term. The military, for example, often refers to information warfare broadly to include time-tested techniques and tools like disinformation, cryptography, radio jamming and bombing communications centers.
But it is high-tech information warfare that has been getting most of the attention and funds lately. This budding warfare industry is an eclectic field indeed, ranging from computer scientists whose work is financed by the Government to "hackers for hire" who specialize in theft, extortion and sabotage. In his Senate testimony, Mr. Deutch said the C.I.A. had determined that cyberattacks were now "likely to be within the capabilities of a number of terrorist groups," including the Hezbollah in the Middle East.
The weapons of information warfare are mostly computer software, like destructive logic bombs and eavesdropping sniffers, or advanced electronic hardware, like a high-energy radio frequency device, known as a HERF gun. In theory, at least, these weapons could cripple the computer systems that control everything from the electronic funds transfer systems of banks to electric utilities to battlefield tanks.
For the military, information warfare raises the prospect of a new deal for America's adversaries. Cyberwar units could sidestep or cripple conventional weaponry, undermining the advantage the United States holds.
"Even a third-tier country has access to first-class programmers, to state-of-the-art computer hardware and expertise in this area," said Barry Horton, principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, who oversees the Pentagon's information warfare operations. "There is a certain leveling of the playing field."
Cyberspace also plays havoc with traditional definitions: what is a military and what is a commercial target, if 95 percent of military communications are over commercial networks; what is within United States jurisdiction and what is an international issue, when cyberspace has no geographic borders? "We have to redefine national security for the information age," Mr. Horton said.
There is, to be sure, an aspect of self-interest in the information warfare alarms raised by military and intelligence agencies. Those bureaucracies are sizable and costly, and in the post-cold-war era, they are in need of new enemies.
"The people who are concerned about information warfare tend to magnify its significance," said Mr. Libicki of the National Defense University.
The Electronic Industries Association estimates that over the next decade, the Government's information warfare procurement, mainly for specialized software and services, will grow sevenfold, to more than $1 billion annually.
Yet the projected spending on information warfare amounts to pocket change, compared with next year's military budget of $257 billion. "The point of information warfare is that you don't need fighter planes and billions of dollars to launch an attack on the United States anymore," said Winn Schwartau, an author and president of Interpact Inc., a security consulting firm.
The Government's computer systems are clearly susceptible to intruders. In 1988, a Cornell student sent a worm program over the Internet that penetrated military and intelligence systems, shutting down 6,000 computers. In 1994, a 16-year-old British hacker broke into the computer system at an Air Force laboratory in Rome, N.Y. And in "red team" exercises, the military's experts have been able to break into 65 percent of the Defense Department systems they tried to penetrate, using hacking tools available over the Internet.
But nearly all these intrusions have been into some of the two million computers in military networks that handle unclassified information -- that information can, however, be useful to enemies, military officials concede. The classified information is on the other 10 percent of the military's computer networks, which do not have open links to the outside.
Private companies and banks typically do not have the luxury of making their networks off-limits to outsiders. "We invite our customers into our computer networks," said Colin Crook, the senior technology officer of Citibank. "I think our problem is more challenging than the Government's."
Citibank got an alarming brush with the problem two years ago, when a Russian computer hacker tapped into the bank's funds-transfer system, taking more than $10 million. Citibank will not discuss the case, but investigators say the bank recovered all but $400,000.
In the business world, the reported hacker activity to date is mostly stealing credit card numbers, vandalizing software or harassing Internet service companies. "At the moment, we're dealing with penny ante stuff," said Peter Neumann, a computer scientist at SRI International, a research firm in Menlo Park, Calif. "But the risk of much greater damage is there."
Mr. Frank of Darpa speaks of a "frightening vulnerability" of utilities systems, of the private data networks of the international financial system and of the digital switches at the core of modern phone systems.
Major breakdowns caused by computer intruders have not yet occurred. But there is evidence that more sophisticated hackers are now at work. The Science Applications International Corporation, a military contractor and technology security firm, surveyed more than 40 major corporations, which confidentially reported that they lost an estimated $800 million because of computer break-ins last year, both in lost intellectual property and money.
Private investigators and bankers say they are aware of four banks, three in Europe and one in New York, that have made recent payments of roughly $100,000 each to hacker extortionists. The bankers and investigators would not identify the banks, but the weapon used to blackmail the banks was a logic bomb -- a software program that, when detonated, could cripple a bank's internal computer system. In each case, the sources said, the banks paid the money, and then took new security measures.
Frequently, experts say, the tighter security measures are nothing fancy. One problem is modems on employees' computers. They are open connections to the outside world, potentially giving hackers access to an internal network.
"You can't eliminate risk of information attacks, but you can minimize it," said William J. Marlow, a senior vice president of Science Applications International. "Many of the steps are not all that high-tech or expensive."
Since it was stung in the Russia episode, Citibank has taken a series of measures, from instructing employees to never assume a computer network is secure to aggressively pursuing hackers. "You mess with us and we're going after you," Mr. Crook said. "This is a big deal for us now."

HEADLINE: Bosnia Election Results Certified by West Despite Fraud Charges

BYLINE: By MIKE O'CONNOR 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Bosnia's election, which was intended to foster unity but was stained by accusations of intimidation and fraud, was certified today by the Western officials who ran it.
The certification, by the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, was viewed by many as a landmark in the country's move toward stability. It allows for the installation of a new national government and legislature as well as legislatures in the country's two political entities. The results confirm that the three-member presidency will be led by a Muslim and that most legislative seats went to members of the three dominant nationalist parties. 
 After validating the results, Robert H. Frowick, the retired American diplomat who leads the European group's mission in Bosnia, conceded that the elections were neither free nor democratic in the tradition of Western democracies, but he said they were acceptable considering that the country was emerging from a war.
"The elections provided the mechanism to help overcome the centrifugal forces unleashed by the war," he said.
European nations and the United States, which control the European group, are putting to the test their theory that it is better to have a government begin operating, even if it comes to power through flawed elections, than to wait until fairer elections can be held.
After today's certification, the first step toward creating a functioning Government will be a meeting, expected as early as Monday, of the three-member national executive body called the presidency. The presidency is to consist of one representative of Bosnian Croats, one Serb and one Muslim, each of whom won office in the election on Sept. 14.
With the election results now official, economic sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia and on the Bosnian Serbs, suspended earlier, can be lifted by the United Nations.
Diplomats and others who opposed going forward with the election say it has only legitimized rule by the three nationalist forces that brought the country to war in the first place.
Those who opposed holding the elections in September fear that the new government will be deadlocked by conflict among the three dominant nationalist parties. Opposition parties won very few seats in the legislatures, where moderate voices could have an influence.
Some Bosnian Serb leaders have contended that the victory, by about 40,000 votes, of Alija Izetbegovic, a Muslim, over Momcilo Krajisnik, a Serb, for chairmanship of the presidency, resulted from election fraud.
Some Western officials and opposition politicians had been critical of the election preparations almost from the time the first international supervisors arrived in January.
They complained about confusion and ineptness and about the failure to protect opposition members from intimidation and attacks by thugs supporting the nationalist parties in Muslim, Serb and Croat-controlled areas. But these complaints paled when compared with criticisms of how the voting and ballot counting were handled.
A private monitoring group, the International Crisis Group, charged that the number of ballots counted was several hundred thousand higher than the number of possible voters. It contended that the only logical explanation was that ballot boxes had been stuffed by election officials, almost all of whom had been named by the governing parties.
A judicial panel of the Organization for Security and Cooperation agreed that the number of ballots was suspicious, and on Friday it recommended that ballots be recounted.
But a recount was rejected by the commission of the European group that has overall responsibility for the election. The commission is dominated by senior members of the organization and representatives of the three Bosnian governing parties.
Mr. Frowick said that it was not known with certainty how many people were eligible to vote or how many had decided not to vote and that therefore there was no reason to suspect the number of ballots cast.
He also said his view that the election was acceptable, even if flawed, was based in part on the reports of international monitors who observed the voting for the European group.
The reports are favorable. But monitors visited polling places only periodically, going from one to another, leaving local election officials unsupervised most of the time.
"These local officials were sitting there with blank ballots and the ballot boxes," said an official with the monitoring group, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "That's a big temptation."
Some leaders of opposition parties insist there was fraud, but while they predict it will lead to cynicism about the new Government, they take it as something they must accept.
Zivko Radisic, the leader of a moderate Bosnian Serb coalition, said: "We know the amount of manipulation was large, but we accept the results because we have no choice. There is no appeal if the West tells us to agree."
Haris Silajdzic, who had resigned as Prime Minister of the former Bosnian Government and who lost his bid for the Muslim seat in the presidency, said: "The power is with the ruling parties and the international community. We can say nothing."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE SOUTH;
Tennesseans Unmoved as Candidates Come to Town, Again.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Two years after Tennessee voters gave Republicans one of their best showings in the country with victories for governor, both Senate seats and two House seats, the state has become one of the premier battlegrounds of the 1996 election.
President Clinton has visited here twice since the Democratic convention in August. With nine campaign stops this weekend in Nashville, Chattanooga, Memphis and Spring Hill, Vice President Al Gore, a native son, has come home 10 times this year and 3 times since the convention. Bob Dole, the Republican challenger for President, and his running mate, Jack Kemp, have been here five times since the Republican convention. And both parties have poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into television advertising in the state's four major markets. 
 "Tennessee usually doesn't get this much attention," said Richard A. Pride, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.
But for all the barnstorming, recent polls and interviews with voters around the state suggest that neither party is likely to make major gains this year, an indication that Tennessee voters have had their fill of change for the time being. Mr. Clinton, who won Tennessee by five percentage points over President Bush in 1992, is leading Mr. Dole for the state's 11 electoral votes, and none of the state's House and Senate seats, now held by 7 Republicans and 4 Democrats, is expected to turn over.
Still, the battle continues, fueled by the Republicans' resounding gains of 1994 and the Democrats' efforts to make certain they do not make further headway.
Almost every major Republican who ran won: Don Sundquist, a former Representative from Memphis, defeated the Mayor of Nashville, Philip N. Bredesen, for governor. Bill Frist, a heart surgeon with no political experience, stunned Senator Jim Sasser, who had won 94 of 95 counties in winning a third consecutive term in 1988. In a special election for the final two years of the Senate seat that Mr. Gore won in 1990, Fred Thompson, a former actor, defeated Jim Cooper, a six-term Democratic member of the House.
And victories by Zach Wamp in the Third Congressional district and Van Hilleary in the Fourth gave Republicans a majority in the state's Congressional delegation for the first time since 1972, 5-4.
Worse yet for the Democrats, the trend also reached down to the state level. Shortly after the elections, two members of the state Senate switched parties to give Republicans control of the chamber for the first time since Reconstruction.
"The Democrats grew too out of touch with Tennessee," said Dave Deming, 36, a lawyer and a Republican from Nashville, explaining what happened two years ago.
Despite President Clinton's enduring popularity in the state, for many Tennessee Democrats, the Republican surge was a stinging rebuke that left them dismayed and demoralized. While many blamed the overall anti-incumbency spirit that was sweeping the country, they also cited their own complacency and an inability to combat the Republicans' success in drawing in national social issues, like abortion rights and gay personnel in the military into local races.
S. A. (Shep) Wilbun Jr., a Shelby County Commissioner, said that the lack of interest was particularly damaging in his county, which includes Memphis, the state's largest city and the area with the largest concentration of black voters. He said that after three black candidates ran in the primary for Shelby County mayor, splitting the vote, most black voters ignored the general election, and a Republican won.
The low turnout among blacks, about 31 percent, also played a large role in helping Mr. Sundquist defeat Mr. Bredesen, Mr. Wilbun said.
Houston Gordon, a lawyer from Clarksburg who is challenging Mr. Thompson for the Senate, said another reason for the Democrats' failures was the effectiveness with which Republicans across the state played "hot-button cultural issues" to the large bloc of independent voters, about a third of all those registered.
He said their support of Republican candidates, combined with the low turnout among blacks and others who tend to vote Democratic not only helped Republicans at the top of the ticket but also many who ran in local elections.
Mr. Gore's appearances in Tennessee alone would suggest that party leaders at all levels are vitally interested in reversing the Republican gains, not to mention helping Mr. Clinton win a second term and raising Mr. Gore's Presidential aspirations for 2000. Mr. Gore told reporters last week: "I believe that the pendulum will swing in the Democratic direction this year," adding that he and Mr. Clinton intended to match the Republicans in Tennessee "visit for visit and commercial for commercial" through the election.
For change to occur, however, Democrats said that party leaders have to revitalize their supporters all across the state. "We've got to convince people who usually vote Democrat and didn't the last time that the economy is good, things are working and they have to stay with Democrats to get the job finished," said Evelyn Stell, a retired teacher active in politics in the Memphis area.
Tennessee is enjoying boom times in many areas, particularly around Nashville, the capital, where construction companies cannot hire workers fast enough for new projects. Last week, the state announced that unemployment had reached a low of 4.4 percent, well below the national average of about 5.5 percent.
But Democrats say it would take more than a robust economy to hold off additional Republican gains. "A lot of people didn't realize last time how important it was to vote, " said Dedrick Boddie, a black 27-year-old catering service worker in Memphis. Mr. Boddie, a Democrat who sat out the 1994 elections, said, "But I think people have woken up to the things going on, and the turnout this year is going to be tremendous."

HEADLINE: New York May Lose More House Seats, Analysts Report

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
If New York State's population growth continues to lag behind that of other states, it will lose one and possibly two seats in the House of Representatives after the next United States Census, and it will face diminished clout in Congress, government and private analysts say.
A reapportionment of Congressional seats today would leave New York State with just 30 of the 435 House seats, a humbling drop from the 41 it held in 1970 and fewer than California's 52 and Texas's anticipated 31 seats, said David C. Huckabee, an analyst for the Congressional Research Service, which studies population trends and reapportionment for Congress. 
 Projections of recent population trends to the year 2000, when the next census will be taken, indicate New York would lose two seats, he said.
While a state's political influence hinges on such variables as House committee chairmanships, the sheer size of a delegation is important in putting votes behind bills that members are likely to treat in a bipartisan manner. A change in size could affect everything from New York's share of Medicaid and welfare money to military industry contracts to the purchase of such private lands as Sterling Forest in Orange County. [Page B5.]
"Every seat you lose diminishes your power," said Nita M. Lowey, a Congresswoman who represents parts of Westchester, Queens and the Bronx.
Connecticut is on course to lose one of its six Congressional seats, but New Jersey appears likely to retain its 13 seats.
The loss of a seat in Connecticut could weaken a delegation whose three Democrats and three Republicans have usually united on such issues as submarine contracts for Electric Boat of Groton and jet engine contracts for Pratt & Whitney of East Hartford.
For the nation as a whole, the predicted changes in the House's political balance would be relatively modest compared with those in previous census years, where swings of four seats in a single state occurred and the balance of power shifted to the Sun Belt from the industrialized Northeast and Midwest.
If Congressional seats were reapportioned based on today's population, Arizona, Georgia, Montana, Nevada and Texas would each gain one seat while Connecticut, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania would lose one each.
In both New York and Connecticut, a major redrawing of Congressional district boundaries is likely to cost an incumbent Congressman a seat. "Somebody will have to walk the plank," said Daniel Chill, the reapportionment consultant to Speaker Sheldon Silver of the New York Assembly.
Retirements, deaths, criminal indictments, judicial appointments and campaigns for higher office may create the flexibility to keep the remaining New York delegation happy, said Mr. Chill, who will play a major role in the part Byzantine, part high-tech art of redrawing district lines.
But if the census mathematics require that an incumbent be sacrificed, the choice will be determined mainly by which regions of the state have lost the most population and by less tangible factors like political grudges and the legal pressures to maintain a strong presence of black and Hispanic legislators.
In New York State, much of the population loss since 1990 has come in western and central parts of the state like Broome County, which includes Binghamton, and Oneida County, which includes Utica and Rome, said Robert Scardamalia, chief demographer for the state's Economic Development Corporation. If the next reapportionment process were politically neutral, which is not likely, those counties would be ripe for the loss of a Congressional seat. The Congressional district lines are redrawn by state lawmakers after the census figures come out.
While the United States Census Bureau tries once every decade to count every single American, it also periodically prepares less exact tallies. Every year, it estimates the nation's population by calculating births, deaths and indicators of migration like Internal Revenue Service records of shifts in jobs. It last did so in July 1995, and those figures were released earlier this year.
At least twice a decade, the Census Bureau also makes projections based on population trends since the start of the decade. The yearly estimates are regarded as more precise than the projections, but they do not try to foretell where a state's population is heading the way the projections do.
Still, projections are confounded by events. The latest census projections, made in 1994, did not predict the recession in California, which stalled its population growth and for now has dampened the state's hopes of gaining three more seats in 2002.
New York State, with 18.1 million people on July 1, 1995, has actually gained population since the 1990 Census, but not as fast as states like Texas and Georgia. Between 1990 and 1995, it gained only 146,000 people, or 0.8 percent, while the nation as a whole was growing by roughly 5.6 percent. Connecticut, with 3.3 million people, has actually lost 12,454 residents, the estimates show.
The reasons so many natives and longtime residents of New York and Connecticut keep leaving for other states, offsetting the gains of births and immigration, are elusive, but many experts blame the Northeast's tepid rates of job growth. In 1958, the Northeast had 35.6 percent of the nation's factories, said Carl Haub, a demographer for the Population Reference Bureau in Washington, which studies population trends. By 1992, the percentage had shrunk to 21.7.
A study of New York City in March shows that about 300,000 more people left the city than moved in from 1990 to 1995, leaving the city with a slight overall loss.
Connecticut has proved less inviting because its military industries have shrunk and there have been some clouds over its insurance industry as well, said G. Donald Ferree Jr., associate director of the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research.
New York's political landscape will also be affected by other trends, like the aging of its baby boomers and the growth in the number of Hispanic, black and Asian residents.

HEADLINE: U.S. USING SWAPS TO PROTECT LAND

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is expanding a program that is significantly reshaping the Government's land holdings, trading surplus public acreage to take environmentally sensitive sites out of private hands.
In recent years, millions of acres worth hundreds of millions of dollars have changed hands this way, in deals that have added prime wildlife habitats and filled other gaps in Federal holdings. In return, land of equal dollar value has been released to developers. 
 The Administration's willingness to negotiate such deals carries a subtle double-edged political message: that President Clinton is committed to conservation but that he does not want to ride roughshod over property owners who have fought many of his programs.
Indeed, the swap approach has pleased powerful business interests and created a new field of entrepreneurial intermediaries, some in nonprofit land trusts and others who are real-estate speculators. They act as brokers or even promoters of the swaps, and they deal in cash so the Government can avoid paying cash for land, which would require the approval of Congress.
The decades-old practice has achieved new prominence in the last few months through three highly publicized efforts to arrange unusually big swaps that would save especially notable resources in the West from logging and mining. The sites involve a proposed gold mine near Yellowstone National Park, California redwood groves and Utah's red-rock wilderness.
On Saturday, Federal and state negotiators announced an agreement in principle in the California case, in which they are trying to arrange property swaps and cash payments to avert logging by the Maxxam Corporation in the redwood groves it owns in the northwest corner of the state. Although the company has agreed to transfer thousands of acres of its land for $380 million, the payment could take the form of cash, property or both. The next step is to identify property suitable for an exchange and to determine its fair value, which always proves difficult in these arrangements.
The case has an especially high profile because of its cost and because public opposition to the logging has led to protests and hundreds of arrests at the site.
Among conservationists, some like the trend toward land swaps, but others are troubled.
"I see no other likely source of revenue on the horizon that is going to enable us to protect these sensitive areas as quickly as we have to," said David Wilcove of the Environmental Defense Fund. He said half of all endangered species were found only on land not controlled by the Government, which makes protecting the animals much more difficult.
"Land swaps are in vogue right now," said Phil Hocker of the Mineral Policy Center, an environmental group here that concentrates on mining. "And they are in vogue in ways that I think are potentially dangerous. Frankly, what this whole trend toward exchanges is doing is creating a loophole for important public-lands management decisions to be made with relatively little examination."
Robert H. Nelson, a public-lands expert who is a senior fellow at the pro-business Competitive Enterprise Institute, gave the exchanges grudging support. "They are a second-best solution," Mr. Nelson said. "There are public attitudes that prevent you from doing it in cash. So you have to do it in barter. A barter economy is inferior to a cash economy. But given the constraints and the alternative of doing nothing, this is better."
The Administration did not originate the program, which also thrived in the Reagan years. But it has enthusiastically embraced the approach, turning to land swaps to prevent development.
The most powerful force driving the Government toward such swaps is its own budget rules, under which Congress has to approve every expenditure, and every penny raised from property sales has to go into the Treasury Department's general funds.
But unlike straightforward Federal sales and purchases of land for cash, the carefully arranged land swaps never show up in the Federal budget. If the swaps are within a single state's borders, they often require no approval whatsoever by Congress.
That is especially important because the Congress has not been keen in recent years to acquire land for conservation and the amount appropriated for that purpose has been steadily declining. Although a fund intended for conservation purchases has a surplus of more than $10 billion, most of it from offshore oil-drilling royalties, the money is being used to balance the Federal budget instead. Spending from the fund has dwindled to $140 million this year, less than half the amount spent a few years ago.
Partly because of the budget pressures, Federal land managers in some states, especially in the West, have been eagerly turning to exchanges in which they acquire property that they want for conservation and turn over other land to developers.
In Arizona, the Government is negotiating with three copper companies with the idea of giving them land for expanding mines in exchange for tracts more suitable for conservation. Thousands of acres are to change hands, said William J. Ruddick of the Bureau of Land Management, the leader of the land-exchange team.
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who helped pioneer exchanges when he was Governor of Arizona in the 1980's, said in an interview that their use was likely to expand.
"The word kind of gets out," Mr. Babbitt said, referring to the attention generated by deals like the Yellowstone proposal.
In that proposal, the Government has agreed to offer a gold mining company $65 million worth of land or leases in Montana so it will abandon claims to the New World Mine, which is on public land near the national park.
But experts involved in the process said it was extraordinarily complicated, especially when assessing the value of the lands to be exchanged. They have to be equal.
Selecting the lands for the Yellowstone swap, which Mr. Clinton announced last month, might take many months, officials estimated.
Conservationists, public-land managers and developers seem to agree that by trading surplus land for tracts that are more valuable ecologically, the Government can move with greater speed and effectiveness to protect important habitats, watersheds and wildernesses.
For years, the Bureau of Land Management, which controls 270 million acres and manages the mineral rights for even more land, has been steadily swapping one parcel for another, usually as a way to get small holdings of private land that lie in national parks, forests, wildlife refuges and the like.
"Over the last 5 or 10 years, we have completed 60 or 70 exchanges a year," said Ray Brady, the chief of the lands division. He said the agency typically acquired 150,000 acres a year, worth $60 million.
The creation of a vast wilderness preserve in the Mojave Desert is driving land managers in California toward more land exchanges, officials said. So is the expansion of cities like Las Vegas, Nev., that creep outward through Federal holdings that can be swapped for more environmentally important lands.
Land exchanges have many advocates in Congress, which passed a law in 1988 intended to make them easier to carry out. Their most prominent advocate may be Speaker Newt Gingrich. On Saturday, the House passed a mammoth parks and public lands bill that authorizes many such arrangements.
In some instances, lawmakers are just as interested in fostering development on one of the parcels being traded as they are in conserving the other ones. That seemed to be the case in one provision of the public lands bill that the House just approved, which would trade tracts in Utah so a ski developer could build a site for the 2002 Winter Olympics.
The transactions raise many complicated questions. How are priorities for land acquisition and disposal being set? To what extent should private speculators and nonprofit conservation groups join in the dealings? Which corporations should be compensated when their development activities are limited? And, to the extent that the program merits expansion, how should exchanges be simplified, and how much should they be controlled in Washington?
People involved in the process often say that they wish it could be made more simple but that they do not expect that to happen.
But Mr. Babbitt said: "It should be complicated. There are serious issues here."

HEADLINE: Immigrants' New Road Leads to Suburbia;
Away From the Big City, Seeking a Better Life but Facing New Tensions

BYLINE: By MIRTA OJITO 

DATELINE: HAVERSTRAW, N.Y.

 BODY:
One balmy winter night long ago, Jose de la Cruz, a poor man from the Dominican Republic, met and fell in love with a pretty young woman from New York who was vacationing in his hometown.
She was from the village of Haverstraw, a place that he had never heard of but that sounded promising if hard to pronounce and even harder to envision. And so Mr. de la Cruz, then 20, packed his bags and followed Maria Henriquez to this tiny old village by the Hudson. 
 And so did the rest of his family. And most of his family's families, setting in motion an immigration chain that has yet to reach its last link. In the 26 years since love struck Mr. de la Cruz and Miss Henriquez (Mr. de la Cruz calls it love at first sight), nearly 50 de la Cruz or de la Cruz-related family members have settled here or in surrounding towns.
They own a grocery store and a restaurant. They work as welders or therapists. One hopes to work for NASA. Another is a pilot. Several do not know what they want yet; they are still in high school or in diapers.
And thus, experts say, is the history of American suburbs written these days.
The suburbs, long the refuge of fleeing city dwellers, are quietly becoming a magnet to newly arrived immigrants, who, lured by relatives and the promise of a better life, are bypassing the city and driving to the proverbial American dream straight from the nation's biggest international airports.
The trend, entrenched everywhere there is a significant immigrant population, is transforming the character of many suburbs, sociologists and demographers say. It is making suburbia more heterogeneous and interesting. But, like never before, it is also pressing onto unprepared suburban towns the travails and turmoil of the cities.
The recent phenomenon is possible, in part, because of some changes that had already begun in suburbia.
No longer exclusively white and affluent, suburbia has changed over time, especially since the 1970's, and is now also black and Hispanic, poor and crowded, besieged by unemployment and drugs, dotted by housing projects or rundown apartment buildings. In short, affordable and therefore attractive to poor immigrants looking for a place to live and work, where English is not a must and where they are likely to find people like themselves.
A place, in many ways, like Haverstraw.
"I bet Haverstraw is better known in the islands than in New York City," said Francis (Bud) Wassmer, Mayor of Haverstraw, referring to the Caribbean.
According to the 1990 Census, 51 percent of the village's people are Hispanic, and town officials and civic advocates said the number is closer to 70 percent now because of growth since 1990 and undercounting in that census.
Just 30 miles north of Manhattan, this 2.5-square-mile village first became home to a significant Hispanic population in the 1940's, when businessmen in the area sought workers in Puerto Rico for their factories and beet fields, a common practice in those days. To entice them to move, they took pictures and films of Haverstraw to Puerto Rico's decimated countryside and later offered bonuses to employees who procured more workers from the island.

Word of Haverstraw Goes Island to Island
Puerto Ricans settled in the downtown area, where inexpensive housing was available, and blended in. Their children went to school, got jobs and left. Eventually, the parents left, too. But word of Haverstraw hopped from one Caribbean island to another, and soon Dominicans took over the jobs and houses that Puerto Ricans had abandoned.
Slowly, this formerly Italian-Irish-German village -- the world's brick-making capital, as the old-timers like to boast -- became so Dominican that former neighbors in some of the island's hidden little towns have encountered each other here, on the streets of Haverstraw.
Now the library, which is almost 100 years old, stocks an extensive selection of bilingual books and the local middle school has five bilingual teachers. Old businesses -- a candy store and one of the country's oldest family-owned bakeries -- have closed down, while 18 bodegas have opened. Stores like the Village Shoppe, owned by Henry Aaron for more than 40 years, no longer sell men's suits; instead, they sell children's outfits and sturdy work boots.
The quaint Village Coffee Shop sells rice and beans, each dish served by Margarita Acevedo, who 11 years ago was a homemaker in Santo Domingo. A few blocks from her place, abandoned quasi-Victorian mansions for sale dot a riverfront so pretty and unspoiled that in many other places buyers would be snatching them up for $500,000 each. Here, they sell for $200,000, sometimes less.
The strains of merengue spill from the dilapidated pink windows of a Victorian mansion. Children yell in Spanish in the streets and men kick a soccer ball in their front yards. A girl braids the hair of her sister on the freshly painted steps of a stately house with white pillars.
It is precisely this Latin character that makes the village so attractive to newcomers. It is also, some say, the reason why many other non-Hispanic people stay away.
"People around here have marked Haverstraw as an evil town, a ghost town," said the Rev. Antonio R. Welty, the Colombia-born pastor of the village's Central Presbyterian Church. "They can't see anything good coming out of this village. 'How good can it be if it's full of Latinos?' they ask themselves. So they stay away and don't invest here, which is a shame."
The Mayor is trying to change that. He wants people to realize the village's potential. He wants a ferry and a passenger train, which the town had but lost years ago, as well as a developed waterfront and shopping centers.

Hispanic Population: The Mayor's View
Yet he also perceives the Hispanic population mostly as a problem.
"Garbage," Mr. Wassmer said when asked the biggest challenge immigrants posed to the village. "They produce a lot of heavy garbage. I mean, rice and beans are heavy, you know."
Mr. Wassmer also said Hispanic immigrants crowded the streets. That is a problem, he said, because police officers, who he said make an average of $70,000 a year here, must spend considerable time and effort to "keep them off the streets as much as it's legally possible."
The Mayor, Hispanic leaders here said, just does not understand.
Mr. Wassmer, who will turn 50 in two months and was born and raised in the village, wants the town of his childhood back. During a leisurely walk around the village, he wistfully pointed to all the places he remembered from earlier years that are no longer there. Bodegas and other businesses have taken their place.
At the same time, Hispanic leaders, who grew up here, work to make sure that old times never come back. They want affordable housing for poor people; they want not just bilingual but bicultural police officers who understand that people hang out in the streets not necessarily because they want to but because their apartments are crowded and hot. They want programs to keep idle adolescents occupied during the hot summer months. And, more than anything else, they want recognition.
"It's almost as if we don't exist," said Ronaldo L. Figueroa, 42, a Rockland County drug-abuse specialist who heads the local Hispanic Coalition, an advocacy group. "We are here, we are the majority, but they don't see us."
Their invisibility is partly a function of their lack of political power and, more important, of interest in the political process. Haverstraw has never had a Hispanic mayor. The first who tried, Angelo Cintron, a businessman, lost by 140 votes of the almost 4,000 cast last year. Hispanic voters, who represent half of the total, did not vote for him heavily.
"We don't take ownership of where we live," said Edna I. Rivera, who runs Housing Opportunities for Growth, Advancement and Rehabilitation, or Hogar, a community economic development agency that finds jobs and builds affordable housing. "We have this mentality that one day we are just going to click our heels and go home."
That is beginning to change. Mr. Cintron, a village trustee since 1992, said he will run for mayor again. He plans to rent a voting machine to teach new Hispanic voters how to vote. Another Hispanic trustee was elected last year. And Ms. Rivera was a national delegate to the Democratic Convention last month.
There are two Spanish-language newspapers in the village, and Hispanic leaders frequently organize voter registration drives, especially now that new anti-immigration laws force local governments to deny benefits to noncitizens.
The incipient political awareness of Haverstraw's Hispanic population is a sign of how suburbs will be politically shaped by new immigrants, said John R. Logan, who along with Richard D. Alba, both sociology professors at the State University of New York at Albany, is researching how members of minority groups live in the suburbs of New York, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
So far, the professors have found, all five regions follow the same pattern: new immigrants tend to move to suburbs that are a little rundown, less affluent than average and already have a smaller proportion of non-Hispanic whites than in the richer suburbs.
"If the suburbs come not to mean the land of Republicans and instead become places where the same Congressman represents a rich white American and a poor immigrant from, say, Haverstraw, it would force politicians to take a more practical approach in recognizing problems and mobilizing to act," said Professor Logan, who this year is a visiting scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation in Manhattan.
Meanwhile, he said, there are more pressing issues for current leaders.
"The question is, how are they going to meet the needs of these new immigrants in a suburban environment?" Professor Logan said. "This is very new for suburbia and it poses a challenge to public institutions."

Bumpy Transition To Life in America
New immigrants, unlike immigrants who have lived in the country for a while, have special needs. They are likely not to speak English. They need jobs, help in finding affordable homes, guidance to enroll their children in schools and information on how to establish credit and even open a checking account. They may also need public assistance to make ends meet until they find jobs. And they need it all in their own language.
Cities, where immigrants traditionally settled, have the services and the expertise to help new immigrants make a smoother transition to life in America. Places like the village of Haverstraw are not always fully equipped to deal with the needs of new immigrants. "We have social problems just like urban communities," Mr. Figueroa said, "but we don't have the resources to address them in the same way, so they tend to accelerate at a greater pace than we can keep up with."
In the village, immigrants are aided by a loose network of hometown leaders, people like Mr. Figueroa, Ms. Rivera and Mr. Cintron, who speak their language and have the cultural sensibility to understand their needs. They also receive guidance and counseling from a Rockland County social service office that is based in the village and employs five bilingual employees.
There is a health clinic that offers free medical care, and transportation is available for a mental health clinic in Pomona a few miles away. Drug and alcohol counseling is available in a village-operated but state-financed office that is run out of a Village Hall office and employs no bilingual, bicultural counselors.
Hispanic leaders think it is not enough. "It's a Band-Aid approach," Ms. Rivera said.
Schools are also having a difficult time. Seventy percent of the children in the local elementary school are from Latin America. Each year, there are too many new children who do not speak English and sometimes come from places where there are no schools and so their level of comprehension is much lower than it should be for their ages.
The village's main problem, though, is housing. Almost all new immigrants are working class. Many are poor. They are living in apartments carved out of 19th-century mansions that were meant for four people and now house 30.
More than 60 percent of the available housing is more than 70 years old and in need of repair. Absentee landlords are rampant.
"By my standards, they are having a terrible time," said Mr. Cintron, a Puerto Rican raised in the Bronx who has lived here for more than two decades. "By theirs, they are probably doing pretty good, considering how poor they are and the kinds of places they come from."
Mr. Wassmer said new immigrants were a "tremendous burden" on the village's already stretched services, such as police, fire and garbage collection. "People at poverty level or below require more services than others, and we just don't have the means or the organization to do it all," Mr. Wassmer said.
Despite the sometimes harsh living conditions, Haverstraw remains a place where new dreams are forged every day.
Carmen Luisa Collado, 19, is the most recent addition to the de la Cruz extended family. Her grandfather is the uncle of Jose Guzman, who is married to Mercedes, who is one of Jose de la Cruz's 16 siblings.
Ms. Collado, who was an accounting student in the Dominican Republic, arrived two months ago and lives in a small apartment in Main Street with her parents and a younger sister. She works wrapping packages for a mailing service and already has big plans for the future.
She wants to study English. In January, she will enroll at a local college to finish her degree and get a better job. Soon after that, she wants to return home to marry her boyfriend of two years. Then, she intends to help him get a visa.
And the two, she hopes, will settle in the village of Haverstraw.

GRAPHIC: Photos: The Latin character of Haverstraw, visible on the streets and fields, lower left, of the tiny old village by the Hudson River, has long been an attraction for newcomers. It is also, some say, the reason why many other non-Hispanic people stay away; Carmen Luisa Collado, from the Dominican Republic, said she hopes to join relatives in making the village her home. Mayor Francis (Bud) Wassmer, below, who was born and raised in the village, wants the town of his childhood back. (Photographs by Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times) (pg. B1)

New Shade in the Political Debate Palette: Mellow

SERIES: CAPITOL SKETCHBOOK

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
The introductory fife and drum music hardly heralded rounds of debating musketry tonight in the four-way television confrontation of the Congressional leaders. Rather, a mood of unusual mellowness followed, as if the leaders were more at the business of a legislative string quartet than tooth-and-claw partisan politics with majority control of Congress at stake.
"I would love to work with you," Speaker Newt Gingrich was soon telling the two Democratic leaders sitting across from him, his gentle tone the very antithesis of the "extreme" label the Democrats have pinned on him in making Mr. Gingrich the villainous poster boy of their multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for 1996. 
 Soft imagery and low decibel level seemed to be the premium in the approach of all four debaters. Within the group's blend of discourse and soft-edged disagreement, pianissimo was the word for Mr. Gingrich as he worked against the Democrats' type casting, smiling easily, talking gently in the historic confines of the House of Burgesses in colonial Williamsburg.
Viewers were treated more to an idealized civics lesson than a bout of tag-team politicking.
"Tom and I have worked together on that," chimed in the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, at one point, in tribute to his Democratic minority counterpart, Senator Thomas A. Daschle.
Habitues of this political city who bothered to tear themselves away from the Washington Redskins football game on a neighboring channel were offered a moment's peace, in effect, before the final legislative work days that will lead to home district electioneering in earnest.
Most noteworthy, perhaps, were the things left unsaid.
The antiquated daily ice deliveries that go to Congressional offices received far more mention in the debate than did the Contract with America, that vaunted instrument with which the Republicans marched to majority power in 1994.
"I carry an ice bucket around this fall as a campaign prop," noted Mr. Gingrich, implying the ice deliveries were a wasteful throwback to Democratic leadership "eighty-two years after the invention of the refrigerator."
Senator Lott quickly corrected his fellow Republican.
"On the House side, not in the Senate," he said, wanting no part of any looming ice issue.
Senator Daschle was fast with an ice riposte in accusing the Republican majority of killing the issue of campaign reform: "It's been iced for another Congress."
The Senator, in fact, took the unofficial honors for the evening in introducing easily remembered buzz phrases to the viewers watching on PBS, dismissing the Republicans' promise of a 15-percent tax cut as "deja-voodoo economics."
His fellow Democratic minority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, seemed intent on keeping issues tangible for the TV audience, noting that if Republican calls for cutting public television had been enacted, viewers "wouldn't have had Big Bird to watch." But the leaders made sure that the public broadcast evening offered no shortage in fresh lessons in good manners.
In fact, Senator Daschle had some of educational television's tone of high-minded mentoring as he looked upon the two Republicans with a benign smile and gently asked, "Will you agree never to shut the Government down again?"
With a touch of the combatant's sharp glint more familiar in the Capitol, Mr. Gingrich responded that he had read somewhere that shutting the Government down was actually another stealth strategem by Dick Morris, the disgraced and dismissed political counselor of President Clinton.
As if sensing that the production was low in red-meat conflict, Senator Lott invoked a fail-safe line of debates past, declaring to Jim Lehrer, the moderator (who was repeatedly praised by all four lawmakers for moderating the evening so moderately), "You know, Jim, they just don't get it."
But he could not really budge the mood of determined civility.
"Interesting format," said Speaker Gingrich. "The four of us can chat in a positive way," he declared, and no one followed up with the obvious question of, well, how then might any of them ever get re-elected amid all that harmony.
The strongest bit of controversy involved an exchange in which Mr. Gingrich denounced the Democrats' use of "coerced" union money in their campaigns, and Mr. Daschle accused the Republicans of inviting "the 200 biggest polluters" to help write anti-environmental legislation.
But even there, the leaders' smiles stayed permanent and their voices were kept low across the pastoral green baize of the debating table.
"People like the noise of democracy," Senator Daschle declared, referring to other voices, other rooms. "But I think they'd like to see the decibel level come down. Tonight was a good example," he contended as the debate wound down to fifes and fadeout.

HEADLINE: Mexican Workers Pay the Price of U.S. Bailout

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (column, Sept. 25) has got it wrong on Mexico. The issue has never been whether Mexico could repay the $12.5 billion United States loan to which he refers. With higher oil prices, a burgeoning $15 billion trade surplus with the United States, reflecting a depressed domestic economy, and multinational corporate investments oriented toward exporting goods to the United States market, the resources have been assured for repayment of the loan (financed by new borrowing in the international financial markets). 
 The issue was, and remains today, who bears the burden of the Mexican economic program. That program is weighted disproportionately in the interests of capital and against workers, both within Mexico and the United States.
Specifically, a million Mexican workers have lost their jobs since the start of the program demanded by the United States Treasury as the price of the bailout.
Nearly 30,000 small and medium enterprises have gone under. Mexican wages have not recovered to 1982 levels.
The net value of Mexican auto-parts exports to the United States in the same period increased to $11 billion from $3.4 billion, representing a significant diversion of potential United States investment and jobs at home.
At the same time, wealthy United States and Mexican investors received 100 cents on the dollar on their Mexican Government investments, which was the real bailout. This is in striking contrast with what occurred in 1982 when Mexico defaulted on its international payments.
Then, the International Monetary Fund, as a condition for its participation in the financial rescue operation, required Mexico's creditor banks to make a contribution to the resolution of the crisis.
The issue is equity: who pays the price for the Mexican economic fiasco? In 1995 and thereafter, the burden has been placed exclusively upon the Mexican and United States worker. The comforting assurances to Mr. Friedman by a high executive of a Mexican conglomerate that the pain was absorbed by Mexican working-class families is hardly reassuring.

HEADLINE: Mexican Workers Pay the Price of U.S. Bailout;
Social Powder Kegs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It's no wonder that after talking to those in Mexico whose political and personal fortunes have been temporarily salvaged by the United States bailout, Thomas L. Friedman would call that bailout a success (column, Sept. 25). The reality is different. 
 Mexico's productive capacity has been ravaged, and virtually all of Mexico's foreign reserves today -- and the Government's ability to repay the United States -- are the product of extensive international borrowing in private markets at exorbitant interest rates. Mexicans will have to bear this burden well into the future, making an economic recovery all the more unlikely.
Furthermore, the Mexican peso is becoming overvalued again, and the current-account deficit is growing. Mexico is falling into the same economic circumstances that spurred the December 1994 peso devaluation and the collapse of its economy.
In the 12 years leading to the devaluation, the adjustment policies promoted by the United States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank generated a concentration of wealth and and expansion of poverty without real economic growth. The intensified application of these policies since the bailout has produced social powder kegs from Chiapas to the United States border.

HEADLINE: 104th Congress Falls Short of Revolution

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Republicans took charge of the 104th Congress with one paramount goal: a balanced budget. They failed. But in the process they succeeded in establishing this Congress as perhaps the most parsimonious ever, making deep cuts in programs that they found useless, wasteful or out of step with their political ideology.
Over the years, efforts to cut spending have generally resulted only in reductions in the rate of spending growth. Vows to eliminate programs have done little but prove how hard it is to make a Federal entity actually go away. 
 But with the $443 billion spending plan for 1997 that the House of Representatives passed on Saturday night and the Senate is expected to approve on Monday, the 104th Congress will have reduced nonmilitary spending by $53 billion over its two-year life span and eliminated more than 300 minor programs, projects and grants. It will secure the Republicans who ran the 104th Congress a place in history as one of the most frugal majorities ever to rule Capitol Hill, but leave them well short of the goal they set when they marched into Washington behind Speaker Newt Gingrich and his revolution.
Despite its cost-cutting zeal, the 104th Congress could not even dent the greatest redoubts of Federal spending -- the huge entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security. And while the Republicans killed scores of spending programs, for the most part they tended to be little known and politically safe targets -- among them the Japan-United States Friendship Commission with its $1.2 million budget and Washington contributions to the African Development Bank, which were terminated in the 1996 budget but for which President Clinton had requested $66 million in 1997.
The Republican-controlled 104th Congress leaves town with two of its most despised bureaucracies still robustly alive: the Department of Education and the Department of Commerce.
"Appropriations is a perfect example of what happened in this Congress," said Thomas E. Mann, the director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution. "There were grand ambitions with a distinct ideological edge and revolutionary rhetoric, ultimately producing something well short of the goal but nonetheless having an impact on policy."
On paper, there have been busier sessions of Congress. As Democrats have pointed out, the 103d Congress passed 465 bills into law, more than twice as many as the 104th Congress. The 80th Congress of 1947-48 was dubbed the "do-nothing Congress," but still produced a record 906 bills that became law.
But never has a Congress attacked spending with the zeal of the 104th. Nor has any previous Congress given such scope to the appropriations committees of the two houses. The committees, by tradition and practice, are known more for their largess than their frugality, but they were given the assignment of striking the first fiscal blow in the Republican revolution.
The Senate and House Appropriations Committees and their 13 subcommittees are responsible for setting spending limits on myriad military, social, education, labor, environment, housing and other programs. Spending on so-called entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security, and payments on the national debt, fall outside the committees' control.
Through the appropriation subcommittees, the Republican majority cut $23 billion in discretionary spending in the current 1996 budget and pinpointed $30 billion more in cuts for the 1997 fiscal year that begins at 12:01 A.M. Tuesday. In the process, the two committees eliminated about 320 Federal programs, many of them with the support of the Clinton Administration. Except for the military, virtually no program, from Head Start to veterans services, was spared from spending cuts.
When the Republicans first took over, to emphasize their intent to cut spending, the new chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, showed up at the first meeting with a machete, a bowie knife and for good measure, a scalpel-sharp alligator-skinning knife.
Few doubted that the Republicans would try to make good on their promises. And although the Republicans ultimately yielded political ground to the White House, they did force Mr. Clinton and Democrats to adopt the mantra of spending cuts.
"I don't object to all the spending cuts they made," said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, "but I do object to their priorities."
The Republicans went well beyond the historical boundaries of the appropriations committees, using the panels' control of the Federal purse strings to try to force major policy changes, especially on reproductive health issues.
The House and Senate voted to prohibit or limit the use of Federal money for dozens of reproductive health programs, from research on human embryos to the Legal Services Corporation taking on abortion-related cases. Congress also voted to ban access to privately financed abortions at United States military hospitals overseas and to reduce by 85 percent the nation's contribution to international family planning programs. The Republican majority tried and failed to eliminate Title X, the 25-year-old family planning program, and to reverse the requirement that states provide Medicaid money for abortions for victims of rape and incest.
"This has been the most anti-choice Congress since Roe v. Wade," said Jo Blum, vice president for government relations for the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. "There have been 53 votes during this Congress on reproductive health issues and we have lost all but five of those votes."
One of the earliest targets of the appropriations committees was the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which came under sustained attack from conservative Republicans for having a purported liberal bent.
The Republicans proposed eliminating all Federal money for the broadcasting group. But in the end, the appropriation committees wound up cutting about $200 million over four years, rolling financing back to the late 1980's levels of $250 million.
But the Republicans ran into a buzz saw of political opposition from the White House and the Democrats over proposed cuts in education, health, jobs and environment programs. In recent months in particular, as President Clinton's commanding lead in the polls has raised Republican anxiety, Congressional budget negotiators have given way to White House demands to shift money back to some of President Clinton's pet projects: the national service program known as Americorps; Goals 2000, the White House plan to improve the quality of education; and COPS, a program to add police officers throughout the country.
The political fight over spending priorities led to two partial shutdowns of the Federal Government and seven months of living with stopgap spending measures before the 1996 budget was settled. The public largely blamed the Republicans for the impasse, and the Administration and Democrats succeeded in painting party leaders as extremists.
"If you were judging this Congress by what other Congresses have done, it would have a measurable impact," Mr. Mann said. "You'd say they've really made a mark. But if you judge it by their aspirations you'll say they have been chastised by the public and the political system. They started out screaming revolution and they ended up restoring funds to the President's favorite accounts."

Behind the Scenes, D'Amato Wields Vast Power in Albany

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO and JANE FRITSCH 

 BODY:
When New York City police officers wanted legislation in Albany to help increase their pay, they turned to Washington, where Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato was eager to be of service.
When New York hospitals needed some political muscle to head off state cuts in money to train doctors, they enlisted Senator D'Amato to lobby state officials on their behalf. 
 And when Republicans in the State Senate wanted to oust their majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, they had Senator D'Amato orchestrate the coup.
From matters of policy to politics to personnel, Mr. D'Amato has emerged as one of the most powerful forces in Albany. So effective is his ability to call in the favors he has meticulously conferred during three decades of political life that he is often able to overwhelm the bosses of the State Legislature and to twist the arm of the Governor himself.
It is an unusual role for any United States Senator, and it is a particularly incongruous position for Mr. D'Amato, who is accustomed to occupying center stage. But he must work the levers of state government from behind the scenes to avoid publicly humiliating his protege, Gov. George E. Pataki.
"Al D'Amato is the single most important Republican, one of national stature, in New York State," said State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Republican of Westchester. "He's a skilled technician. He's got his influence in every portion of the state. I'm not surprised when people reach out to him."
In a recent interview, Mr. D'Amato sought to play down his influence on Mr. Pataki. "He's the captain of the ship and I'm the cheerleader," Mr. D'Amato said. But after a pause, he went on. "They call me continually," he said, referring to state officials who consult him about legislation and policy. "But I was constantly called by other administrations, too," he added.
Mr. D'Amato said that he and Mr. Pataki were "a team working for the state of New York" and that New York was "fighting for survival."
"I particularly want him to be successful and I will do everything and anything I can," Mr. D'Amato said.
"I think that in this state, Senator D'Amato plays a role in most things that happen," said Lawrence Elovitch, a well-known lawyer who is a friend of Mr. D'Amato and who lobbies on trial lawyer issues in Albany. "He certainly is titular head of the party. He certainly has a close relationship with all members of the administration. He has his hand on most things that happen in this state."
No other United States Senator in recent New York history has wielded as much power over state government as Mr. D'Amato. Even such popular and respected Senators as Jacob K. Javits and Daniel Patrick Moynihan have never dominated Albany the way Mr. D'Amato does.
"New York Senators tend to be more, how should I say, Olympian in style, big-picture in nature," said Gerald Benjamin, a political scholar and assistant dean at the State University of New York at New Paltz, who is considered an expert on modern New York State political history. "Javits and Moynihan were famous for focusing on foreign policy, welfare. D'Amato is much more interested in state politics."

Hospitals
Big Cuts Avoided In Doctor Training
When the Greater New York Hospital Association looked for someone on whom to bestow its annual award last spring, the choice was obvious: Senator D'Amato. He was honored at a dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria, a reward for his strenuous efforts to save New York's hospitals from ruinous Federal -- and especially state -- budget cuts.
Mr. D'Amato, a highly public advocate of hospital interests in Washington, had been working behind the scenes to fend off deep cuts proposed by Mr. Pataki in money to train new doctors.
As part of a broader plan to cut hospital costs, Mr. Pataki had proposed to reduce by more than half the $1.9 billion spent by the state each year for graduate medical education. The cuts would help trim a health care system bloated with extra doctors, Pataki aides said.
But such cuts would go to the heart of New York City's public hospitals, which rely heavily on trainee doctors to serve the poor, and would also hit hard at the private teaching hospitals in the city. So hospital administrators immediately asked Mr. D'Amato for help. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. D'Amato was deeply involved with hospital-financing issues and had been fighting proposed Federal cuts in graduate medical education.
"I personally talked to Senator D'Amato about the proposal," said Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the hospital association. "He's extremely knowledgeable about it."
Mr. D'Amato was concerned that the efforts he was making in Washington for New York hospitals were being undermined at home, Mr. Raske said, so the Senator began contacting officials in the Pataki administration.
"He talked with members of the executive branch" Mr. Raske said. "The Senator is a man of great passion and commitment, and he can be extremely influential on any issue. He's an awfully impressive ally."
Mr. D'Amato said he intervened because hospital financing was an issue of great importance to New York. "I just called it to the attention of the budget people and others that the reductions that were called for initially would not save the state real money," Mr. D'Amato said.
In the end, Mr. Pataki backed down and restored most of the money.

Governor Pataki
Marching in Step With Benefactor
Mr. D'Amato solidified his place as the state's pre-eminent political leader two years ago when he engineered and arranged the financing for the election of Mr. Pataki, the first-term State Senator whom he had plucked from obscurity.
More than any other recent political figure, Mr. D'Amato has transformed New York politics, resurrecting a debilitated Republican Party and at the same time methodically installing a network of politicians loyal to him in counties throughout the state. Like Mr. Pataki, those politicians are beholden to Mr. D'Amato for using his formidable fund-raising powers to shore up their campaigns.
Thus it is hardly surprising that Mr. Pataki so often seems to march closely behind Mr. D'Amato.
Last year, for instance, the state Republican Party, and Mr. D'Amato in particular, were sharply criticized for using New York's Byzantine election laws to keep challengers to Bob Dole off the primary ballot. At the time, both Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Pataki defended the system.
But just after the primary, Mr. D'Amato reversed himself and said he thought the laws should be changed to make it easier for challengers to get on the ballot. Mr. Pataki quickly agreed and successfully proposed a law to do just that.
During the primary season, Mr. D'Amato, worried about the national party's drift to the right, complained that the House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, was "scaring Americans," and called Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, a "philosophical ayatollah." Mr. Pataki followed suit, although in muted terms, accusing both men of preaching intolerance.
And when Mr. D'Amato criticized Mr. Dole's campaign earlier this year, Mr. Pataki soon did the same.
To be sure, Mr. Pataki does not bend to all of Mr. D'Amato's demands. But the sheer breadth of Mr. D'Amato's contacts within the Pataki administration, his undisputed closeness to the Governor and his iron control over the state party raise questions about Mr. Pataki's independence.
Mr. Pataki said he considered Mr. D'Amato "a friend and very important asset in Washington" who does not dictate how state government should be run. "He is the Federal representative," Mr. Pataki said. "I run the state."

Police Bill
P.B.A. Turns Tide Through D'Amato
In many ways, Mr. D'Amato's role in Albany is that of a super-lobbyist, someone who has so much influence with so many officials that it has become only natural for people to reach out to him when they want something from state government.
That fact was spotlighted earlier this year when New York City's powerful police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, began a serious push for passage of legislation that would have changed the way the city arbitrated labor disputes with police officers. The change would have made it easier for the union to win such fights, leading, city officials believed, to a steady increase in police salaries.
The Legislature passed the measure with hardly a dissenting vote. But Mr. Pataki vetoed it, agreeing with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's vociferous objections that it would add $200 million to the city's labor costs.
For most governors in this century, the veto would have ended the issue. But the P.B.A. turned to Mr. D'Amato for help. Many P.B.A. members live on Long Island, and the union has had a long and close relationship with the Senator. James J. Lysaght, a lawyer for the P.B.A., gave $10,000 to Mr. D'Amato's legal defense fund in 1993, when the Senate Ethics Committee was investigating allegations that his brother, Armand, was improperly using Mr. D'Amato's office to lobby for a client, the Unisys Corporation, a military contractor.
The Senator "said he would speak to Republican legislators," said Lou Matarazzo, the P.B.A. president, adding, "It must have been helpful."
In the end, Republicans said Mr. D'Amato's support for the overriding of the veto made it easier for them to cast a historic vote against the Governor.
Indeed, both the Democratic-controlled Assembly and Republican-controlled State Senate easily overturned Mr. Pataki's veto. And Mr. Pataki did not work strenuously to fend off the vote to override. Perhaps, legislators said, Mr. Pataki was deferring to Mr. D'Amato's strong support for the bill. At the time, Mr. Pataki said that was not true.
Senator D'Amato said recently that he had long supported efforts to get better pay for police officers. "New York City is losing some of their brightest, finest, youngest, most talented police officers because of pay inequity," he said. "I made my view known."

Personnel
7 Commissioners Linked to D'Amato
Mr. D'Amato's ability to influence state government rests on his strong personal ties to many of the state's top policy makers. Seven of the 16 commissioners appointed by Mr. Pataki to run departments in Albany have close personal relationships with Mr. D'Amato or owe their jobs to his sponsorship.
Several are old friends of the Senator. Some are expected to play important roles in his 1998 re-election campaign. And all have the power to decide issues of great interest not only to Mr. D'Amato but also to many of his major contributors.
"He doesn't need to call the Governor," said one Republican state senator, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "He has so many surrogates who will do things for him. They know what he wants, what he dislikes. They are people who have been close to him. They will do things the way they sense he wants it done."
One is Neil D. Levin, the State Superintendent of Banks. Mr. Levin went to work for Mr. D'Amato on the Senate Banking Committee shortly after graduating from law school. They remained friends after Mr. Levin left to work for Goldman, Sachs & Company, the investment firm. Mr. D'Amato and his former girlfriend, Claudia Cohen, even introduced Mr. Levin to his future wife. When Mr. Levin applied for the state banking job, he sent his resume first to Mr. D'Amato with a note that read, "As always, I really appreciate your help."
Mr. D'Amato has close relationships with many other Pataki administration officials. Charles A. Gargano, the Commissioner for Economic Development, has long been Mr. D'Amato's chief fund-raiser, and at Mr. D'Amato's request, he played that role for Mr. Pataki. One of Mr. Gargano's top deputies, Edward Martin, was Mr. D'Amato's press secretary in the 1980's.
Michael H. Urbach, Commissioner of Taxation and Finance, has been a regular in the Senator's Albany poker game. John F. O'Mara, chairman of the State Public Service Commission, which regulates public utilities, is one of Mr. D'Amato's most trusted advisers.
And Zenia Mucha, the Governor's spokeswoman, ran Mr. D'Amato's press operation for nearly a decade. She remains the Senator's close and loyal friend, speaking to him several times a week by phone.
The Senator's ties to Pataki appointees have given him the kinds of access and influence in state agencies that are normally available only to the Governor or his most senior aides. Earlier this year, for example, Nassau County residents complained to Mr. D'Amato that insurance companies refused to write homeowners' policies on Long Island's South Shore. Mr. D'Amato swiftly called the State Insurance Superintendent, Edward J. Muhl.
Before he joined the Pataki administration, Mr. Muhl had worked for Reliance Insurance Group, whose chief executive, Saul P. Steinberg, has been a major contributor to Mr. D'Amato's campaigns. Within days, Mr. Muhl had promised to investigate possible redlining. And he pledged to open a Long Island field office and amend state policies to make it easier for brokers to issue coverage for coastal homeowners.
Even Democrats who had complained about coastal insurance problems for months expressed grudging respect for Mr. D'Amato's ability to get things done.
"D'Amato is to George Pataki and Ed Muhl what Jim Henson was to Kermit and Grover," said Assemblyman Alexander P. Grannis, a Democrat of Manhattan. "Moynihan doesn't get involved in these local issues; D'Amato will. And that is the bread and butter of a successful politician."
Mr. D'Amato's influence extends to Mr. Pataki's political operations. Kieran Mahoney, who helped manage Mr. Pataki's 1994 campaign and remains one of his top political advisers, had worked on Mr. D'Amato's staff and ran his 1992 campaign. Arthur J. Finkelstein, who is Mr. Pataki's chief pollster, has been the Senator's main political strategist since 1980. And William D. Powers, the chairman of the state Republican Party, is a former D'Amato aide who was picked by the Senator to run the party machinery.
Mr. D'Amato's involvement with the day-to-day workings of Albany runs so deep that he sometimes intervenes in internal personnel matters. In the spring of 1995, for example, a dispute erupted between the Budget Director, Patricia A. Woodworth, and some of Mr. Pataki's closest advisers over how to handle the budget fight.
Ms. Woodworth pushed for deep cuts while Michael C. Finnegan, the Governor's counsel, advised moderation.
With Ms. Woodworth on the verge of quitting, Mr. D'Amato demanded that the administration find a way to assuage her. Her exit would have been a huge embarrassment to the first-year Governor. Ms. Woodworth was persuaded to stay, and later Mr. D'Amato appeared at a news conference in Albany with Ms. Woodworth at his side, in a clear public show of support.
It was a paternal role that Mr. D'Amato has become accustomed to playing. "It's like managing the kids," said John E. Sweeney, the State Labor Commissioner, who is former executive director of the state Republican Party.
He said he frequently consulted Mr. D'Amato on matters large and small. "He calls you right back," Mr. Sweeney said. "I think he appreciates the respect. And he's earned it. He's more experienced; he's the dean. His perspective is probably more valuable than anyone else's could be. He's been through the wars."

Majority Leader
Marino Is Out And Bruno In
Mr. D'Amato holds significant sway over the Republican-controlled State Senate, not only because he is the party's undisputed leader but also because he played a pivotal role in installing its most powerful member, the majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, Republican of Rensselaer County.
Shortly after he was elected, Mr. Pataki demanded the ouster of Ralph J. Marino as majority leader because of a longstanding feud. But the Governor-elect's allies turned to Mr. D'Amato to get the job done. And he did, orchestrating the Thanksgiving Day coup in 1994 that unseated Mr. Marino and transformed Mr. Bruno overnight into one of Albany's most powerful figures.
For nearly a week, Mr. D'Amato had conspired secretly with a handful of senators to build support for Mr. Bruno, dispatching trusted aides to lobby senators and making calls to pressure the fence-sitters into dumping Mr. Marino. In the end, the Marino forces were routed; it was one of the few times that a sitting majority leader had been deposed.
"D'Amato knew how to count," said one Republican official who was involved in the revolt. "He knew what people to call and how to build the coalition. He knew how to do it in a way so that people knew the train was leaving the station. That's not George Pataki's style or one of his strong points. Pataki sent the signal and then went to Florida. D'Amato did the rest."
With that masterly political stroke, Mr. D'Amato had both installed the majority leader and made Mr. Bruno a political debtor whose note would inevitably be called in.
And Mr. D'Amato called in the favor earlier this year during the long fight over the state budget. Mr. Bruno, usually Mr. Pataki's strongest ally in the Legislature, had been increasingly aligning himself with the Democratic Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver. Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver even considered drawing up their own budget to replace Mr. Pataki's.
Mr. D'Amato viewed such a move as a bad precedent that would isolate Mr. Pataki. So he called Mr. Bruno and chided him for disloyalty. Mr. Bruno retreated.
Mr. D'Amato also pulled the reins on Mr. Bruno last spring over a bill to increase the minimum insurance required of automobile owners. The bill was being pushed by trial lawyers, some of Mr. D'Amato's most important allies and financial backers. Mr. Bruno, siding with the insurance industry, opposed it. Buttonholing Mr. Bruno at a fund-raising event in Albany, Mr. D'Amato pressed him to support the legislation. Mr. Bruno grudgingly agreed, according to lobbyists who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The bill passed easily and was signed into law.
"Al was very active," said State Senator Dale M. Volker, a Republican from western New York. "His influence was very, very strong."

The Relationship
A Pragmatist And a Hard-Liner
Friends of both men say Mr. Pataki and Mr. D'Amato genuinely like and respect each other, though they are not particularly close and do not frequently socialize together. But it is not a relationship of equals, the friends say. When the two men appear at public events together, Mr. D'Amato is generally the host or master of ceremonies. And it is Mr. Pataki who routinely consults with Mr. D'Amato, and defers to him, on political questions, not vice versa.
As close as they are, Mr. Pataki and Mr. D'Amato differ in significant ways. Mr. D'Amato is ever the pragmatist, often abandoning ideology in search of a deal. Mr. Pataki is more the ardent fiscal conservative willing to anger special interest groups, including some, like police unions and trial lawyers, that are close to Mr. D'Amato.
Earlier this year, Mr. Pataki won a telling political battle with Mr. D'Amato over legislation to prevent certain workers' compensation lawsuits. Mr. Pataki, siding with business interests, wanted to outlaw the lawsuits.
New York trial lawyers, who opposed the measure and are big financial backers of Mr. D'Amato, asked the Senator to intercede. Having lost in nearly every legislative battle this year, Mr. Pataki refused to budge on the measure, making it a major issue that delayed passage of the state budget.
At least twice, people involved in the negotiations said, Mr. D'Amato intervened with Mr. Pataki to try to broker a compromise, but Mr. Pataki would not budge.
Then in early July, the trial lawyers devised a new compromise and again turned to Mr. D'Amato, who was on a fishing trip in Colorado. He spoke repeatedly by cellular phone to the trial lawyers, who faxed him a copy of their proposal. Mr. D'Amato then relayed the proposal to Mr. Pataki, recommending that he accept it. Mr. Pataki stood his ground. The Governor's version of the bill passed.
Mr. D'Amato said in a recent interview that Mr. Pataki had been right about the issue. "I told people he was serious and he was," Mr. D'Amato said. "I think it was a great victory for him, without trying to be mean-spirited to the litigators."
Mr. Pataki said workers' compensation was just one of several cases where the two men disagreed. "I have a pretty clear sense of what I think the state ought to be doing," he said. "And he has a pretty clear sense of what he ought to be doing, in Washington."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE CONGRESS;
Congress's Leaders Debate Issues With a Seldomly Seen Decorum

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Congress's four top leaders argued over Medicare, tax cuts, education and poison gas tonight, giving the uncertain Congressional elections unique national visibility and displaying a calm civility rarely seen on the floor of either House or Senate as this session ends.
"We have delivered for the American people," said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, answering the opening question -- why Republicans should be returned to power -- with a litany of recent legislative accomplishments, including welfare, immigration and health insurance. 
 But Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, contended that Republicans had sought to cut school lunches, Head Start and student loans and had forfeited their right to power. "We have got to deal with people's practical, everyday problems," he said.
The first-of-its-kind national debate was televised on hundreds of public-television stations from the colonial-era House of Burgesses in Williamsburg, Va., and was followed or preceded by dozens of comparable exchanges between Senate and House candidates around the country. Tonight's debate, five weeks before the election, preceded by one week the first of three debates between Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates.
If none of the exchanges compared even faintly to the pre-Revolutionary oratory heard in this same hall from Patrick Henry and others, the impression of thoughtfulness conveyed was far different from the shouting, insults and booing that typify much of the House debate seen on C-Span these days.
Apparently sensing the potential of the gentler approach, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, used the debate's last moments not for partisan claims but to say, "The people want the decibel level to come down." He said, "What we need is working together, reaching across the aisle."
But the civility did not overwhelm their mission of scoring on the issues each side thought would play best with voters watching on the relatively staid PBS. Speaker Newt Gingrich, opening the discussion on foreign policy, said the first priority was to "defeat drugs," an issue he returned to several times.
And the first time Mr. Gephardt got the microphone he issued a familiar attack, saying, "The Republicans tried to cut Medicare to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans."
But Mr. Gingrich, who often uses the word "lie" to dispute that contention, reacted only by repeatedly explaining that spending for Medicare would have increased under the Republican budget plan, though not as quickly as without it. "It's a cut if you can't buy the same amount of health care," snapped Mr. Daschle. "It's a cut if your premiums go up."
The argument over tax cuts recurred and was practically the only occasion when the issues of the Presidential campaign directly intruded into the Congressional debate. The two Republicans praised and the two Democrats attacked the plan by Bob Dole, the Republican Presidential candidate, for a 15-percent tax cut.
Mr. Gingrich said it would provide $105 more per month for a family of four earning $30,000. Mr. Lott said it was part of the Republican concept of quality of life: "the opportunity to keep more of your own money."
But Mr. Daschle said sweeping tax cuts of that sort would increase the deficit, as they had in the 1980's, and he called the plan "deja-voodoo economics." Mr. Gephardt said the Republicans' tax cuts would mainly help the rich, saying, "We believe tax cuts should be focused on middle-income Americans, and people trying to get into the middle class."
Mr. Gephardt complained about cuts in spending for education, in which he included the Public Broadcasting System's own "Sesame Street." Mr. Lott replied that the $443 billion catchall spending bill the Senate is expected to approve on Monday actually provides increases in education money. "That's an election-year conversion," Mr. Daschle said.
Mr. Gingrich argued that money for education was not as much of a problem as how it was spent. "We spend far too much money on bureaucracy and not enough on teachers," he said. In his approach he repeatedly praised teachers, perhaps seeking to distance himself from attacks on them at the Republican National Convention.
Ridiculing Washington's own school system, he said it spent $9,000 a year per pupil but had too many bureaucrats to teach them well or even to attend to maintenance like repairing boilers and roofs. Congress sought to fix that this weekend with an extra $12 million, but specified that it could not be managed by regular school administration officials but instead by the financial control board that Congress set up last year to try to straighten out the city's messy finances.
Where Mr. Gingrich had cited drugs as a first priority in foreign policy, Mr. Daschle said Congress's duty was to consent to ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which would prohibit manufacture, sale and use of poison gas. Mr. Lott complained that compliance with the pact could not be verified, and Mr. Gingrich said, "In foreign policy, words aren't enough, you've got to have deeds."
The two sides squabbled over campaign finance legislation. Mr. Gephardt challenged the Republicans to support limits on money raised and spent, playing on Mr. Gingrich's argument last year that the system needed more money, not less. Mr. Gingrich hit back by denouncing money spent by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to work against Republican freshmen, saying the Supreme Court would prohibit limits on that sort of campaign spending.
"This money is dues money that is coerced," Mr. Gingrich said.
"That's not true," said Mr. Gephardt.
Mr. Gingrich was correct. The bulk of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s spending this year comes from a special assessment added to regular union dues, and approved at a special convention of the labor federation last winter.
Aside from taxes, the only direct reference to the Presidential campaign came when Jim Lehrer of PBS, the moderator, asked what the relationship between the Presidential and Congressional races was. Mr. Lott pointed to the measures President Clinton had vetoed, and said "We need a President who will work with us to get this job done." But he never mentioned Mr. Dole's name in that context.
Mr. Daschle breezed by the Clinton connection, saying "This President is going to be re-elected." Then he made his appeal for civility.
After the debate, Mr. Gingrich told reporters that these productions by PBS were significant because "they bring a lot more attention to Congressional races."
"It is, after all," he said, "the first branch of Government mentioned in the Constitution. We got the politics away from the 30-second attack commercial into at least a relatively reasonable dialogue."
Republicans had argued to have the participants seated, and Mr. Lott told reporters that that may have contributed to the tenor of the session. "When you put people behind podiums, and you put them in spear-throwing posture, they're more inclined to do that," he said. "It calmed the format down and brought it more into a dialogue, rather than sound bites."
But the Democrats also said they thought they had gained in their effort to nationalize this year's elections, as Republicans successfully did in 1994. "It's not just 435 local elections," he said. "There's a national set of issues that should be discussed. I'm optimistic that a counter-wave is going to happen in 1996."
