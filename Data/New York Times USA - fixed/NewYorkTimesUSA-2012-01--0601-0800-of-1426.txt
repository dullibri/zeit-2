HEADLINE: Financial Advice for Those With Small Nest Eggs

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
When Merrill Lynch recently discouraged its thundering herd of brokers from taking on new clients with under $250,000 in assets available for investing, it wasn't a big surprise.
Brokerage firms have been making these sorts of moves for years, and Merrill is notorious for a leaked memo in the late 1990s that discouraged ''charity work'' for clients with less than $100,000 in assets -- ''poor people,'' as the memo put it.
That patrician view is probably a minority one: if the people who run Merrill Lynch felt that way, they wouldn't be doing what they're doing now, which is trying like mad to figure out a way to service those smaller accounts profitably.
But Merrill's decision to tell its brokers that they might not get paid if they persisted in working with such people reflects one of the sorriest truths of the financial services industry: Nobody has figured out a way to consistently give large numbers of people reasonably priced financial advice across all areas of their life and to do so in an ethical manner. 
The case of Merrill -- and its effective opposite, a start-up called LearnVest -- is instructive in part because it reflects how the world of managing money has changed since Merrill Lynch first started hanging shingles on Main Streets all over the United States.
Charles E. Merrill & Company opened for business nearly 100 years ago, and the company (along with Merrill's current owner Bank of America, interestingly enough), resolved to serve Main Street, not Wall Street. Charlie Merrill put it this way, according to the 1994 book by my colleague Joe Nocera, ''A Piece of the Action.'' In it, he quotes Mr. Merrill as writing the following: ''A new guild has sprung up in the [investment] banking profession which does not despise the modest sums of the thrifty.''
Many brokerage firms have backed away from that sort of stance in recent years. An old saw in the industry notes that the little old lady with the diminishing balance who hounds you when her dividend checks arrive late takes up five times as much time as a 50-year-old millionaire.
Besides, you make more money serving richer people. So the big firms (and thousands of smaller operations and individuals) fight hard over the 1 percent and then siphon off a small cut of their assets each year through fees and other revenue mechanisms.
Everyone else ends up at Charles Schwab or Fidelity and pays roughly $1,500 to $3,000 if they want a full financial plan with advice on insurance and mortgages and other things beyond investments.
A few years ago, Citi took a bold step with its myFi service that aimed to provide just that sort of holistic guidance from bank branches. But it introduced the service at one of the worst economic moments since World War II, and the bank shuttered myFi when it did not succeed quickly enough for its tastes.
Nowadays, a thrifty Merrill customer with modest sums is told to use a service called Merrill Edge. And Merrill is taking its best shot at attracting and keeping them (and eventually) upgrading them to a real broker), given that it believes that there are 28 million households with $50,000 to $250,000 in assets.
The people who service them are called Financial Solutions Advisors. There are more than 500 of them in bank branches and the company will hire 500 more in 2012. There are currently about 800 F.S.A.'s working in call centers as well.
The company (to my great surprise) could not say how many of them were certified financial planners, the sort of people trained to look at a client's whole life before making investment recommendations.
If Merrill isn't tracking this, it's tempting to conclude that the company doesn't make the credential (and holistic advice) a priority and that all it wants to do is push investments. Still, Merrill does the right thing and encourages people to earn the certification by covering classes for F.S.A.'s who want to become certified financial planners.
Dean Athanasia, the executive who oversees Merrill Edge, said that any good investment advice had to be holistic by its very nature. ''If you have a mortgage and debt, then you need to factor that into the consideration of your planning for the future,'' he said. ''You can't just look at assets.''
The Merrill Edge investment account costs a flat $125 each year if you are working with an F.S.A., though the company will also manage a portfolio for you for 1 percent of your assets annually. As for the underlying mutual fund fees, the firm collects ''the appropriate fees based on our agreement with the firm and the prospectus.''
Anyone working this way needs to ask their adviser for a plain-English explanation of how much money, if any, Merrill stands to collect in any way, shape or form now or in the future, based on the mutual funds it selects for you. And if any of you have asked an F.S.A. for a collection of low-cost Vanguard or similar funds, I'd be curious to hear what the reaction was.
On compensation, Merrill appears to be doing the right thing, meanwhile; advisers earn a salary plus incentives based on the amount of assets they gather and manage, whether it's in bank savings accounts or in mutual funds or other investments.
The most curious thing about my conversation with Mr. Athanasia is that he didn't once mention personal budgeting.
Contrast that with LearnVest, which opened for business in late 2009 with a focus on helping younger women. The company patterns itself in part after Weight Watchers and offers content, tools and a financial dashboard that pulls information from all your various accounts. It also conducts what it calls ''boot camps'' for people looking to make financial changes; 280,000 people have signed up for at least one so far.
LearnVest's most intriguing offering, however, is something it introduced earlier this month: three tiers of access to financial plans of varying detail. Customers also get e-mail or phone access to live certified financial planners who can help put the plans to work. Prices range from $69 to $349 for varying levels of phone and e-mail access.
''We don't think financial planning should be a luxury to anyone,'' said Alexa von Tobel, the 28-year-old founder and chief executive, who is quick to point how warped our world is when you need a plan to build wealth but need wealth to hire someone to build you a plan, given that the advice can cost well into the four figures.
But you get what you pay for, and the biggest thing you do not get from LearnVest is investment advice. It's not a registered investment adviser, so it can't tell you what mutual funds to pick. Yet the company persists in calling its plans ''core'' and ''complete'' and mentions retirement planning when promoting one of them.
Sheryl Garrett, who runs a network of financial planners who charge by the hour and says she admires what Ms. von Tobel is doing, worries that LearnVest customers may feel misled in this regard. ''Those terms are really, really dangerous,'' Ms. Garrett said. ''I would fully anticipate that some kind of investment advice would be given when looking at these plans.''
''We are confident that the language used in our marketing, terms and conditions, and disclosures clearly define what is and is not included in each plan package,'' the company said in a written statement. ''We have received great demand in the last week from members across the country and have not encountered any confusion.''
And Ms. von Tobel, who practically bursts with ambition in person, seems set on offering investment advice one way or the other, pretty soon. Until then, the company's disclosure efforts sure seem as if it's trying to wash its hands of any regulatory or other responsibility for the advice it offers up. ''LearnVest is not a financial adviser, planner, broker or tax adviser,'' it reads. ''The services are intended only to assist you in your household and financial organization.''
Meanwhile, her fees are cause for suspicion; can she really pay her seven full- and part-time planners a good wage and turn out a good plan while charging such low fees? She said that she was confident enough in the profit margins she had built into the service that she was willing to take the same no-new-fee pledge (for 24 months in this case) that my friend Suze Orman agreed to in my column last week about her new prepaid debit card.
That said, Ms. von Tobel reserves the right to charge more for extra services beyond what her three plans include today. LearnVest might also build additional packages that might cost more than the current $349 top rate.
As for those planners, Stephany Kirkpatrick, trains all of them. And her newest hire, who is not working with customers quite yet as she's sitting for the certified financial planner exam in two months, is Mina Black, who is 32 years old.
LearnVest hired her from Merrill Edge, of all places, where she worked in the Bank of America branch closest to the Occupy Wall Street protests. ''I have a lot of friends within this market,'' Ms. Black said. ''When they came to me as a Merrill Lynch adviser, there was only so much I could do with them.''
In recent days, according to Ms. von Tobel, the company has seen keen interest from customers. But there have also been a lot of Web site visitors from other financial services companies, including Merrill itself, that might have cause to worry about their younger customers being poached.
''The way we think about this is that we would love to have those clients,'' she said. ''Everyone is looking. We're one big fishbowl.''
Online Correction: January 13, 2012, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this column incorrectly referred to the customer service employees of Merrill Edge as Financial Service Advisors.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit and Consumer Sentiment Rise

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit widened in November to its largest point in five months, prompting some economists to slightly rein in growth expectations for the fourth quarter.
A separate survey released on Friday showed that consumer sentiment hit an eight-month high in early January as Americans grew more optimistic about job prospects.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary January reading on its overall index of consumer sentiment rose to 74 from 69.9 in December for the fifth month of gains and the highest level since May 2011. 
The report topped expectations of 71.5 and contrasted with December's weaker-than-expected retail sales reported on Thursday.
''This shows even though the retail sales number this week was disappointing, there could be a little more underlying strength,'' said Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT Forex in Jersey City. ''I'd be wary of looking at this as a shift in long-term confidence, but I'd look at this as good news today.''
Commerce Department data showed that the trade gap was $47.8 billion in November, exceeding analysts' forecast of a $45 billion deficit.
''The trade balance deteriorated pretty significantly, and it could shave a few tenths of a percent off our expectation for fourth quarter,'' said Russell Price, senior economist at Ameriprise Financial.
JPMorgan Chase said gross domestic product growth for the fourth quarter was now tracking closer to 3 percent than the company's forecast of 3.5 percent.
A wider deficit shows that more goods and services bought by American businesses and consumers were produced outside the country, subtracting from gross domestic product.
''The external outlook does not bode well for U.S. exports, as a deceleration in global growth will coincide with a stronger U.S. dollar due to lingering financial concerns regarding Europe's sovereign debt turbulences,'' wrote Martin Schwerdtfeger, a senior economist at the TD Bank Group, in a note.
A dip in import prices showed that inflation pressures were still muted, giving the Federal Reserve wiggle room as it holds benchmark interest rates at ultralow levels.
Import prices were down 0.1 percent in December after a 0.8 percent gain in November as oil prices fell, in line with economists' expectations.
Economic growth in the final quarter of 2011 is likely to have accelerated from the third quarter's 1.8 percent rate, with many economists expecting an annualized rise of around 3 percent.
Consumer spending, once a crucial pillar of the economy, remains lackluster and sensitive to shocks.
Although some Federal Reserve officials have said further steps may be needed to stimulate the economy, no action is expected at the next Fed policy meeting at the end of the month.
Thirty-four percent of consumers polled in the confidence survey said they had heard of recent job gains, a record high in the survey's history and well above the 21 percent recorded in December.
''The data suggest a stronger consumer spending outlook, rising to about a 2.1 percent gain in 2012,'' Richard Curtin, the survey director, said in a statement.
But consumers still lacked confidence in government economic policies, with the majority rating them unfavorably for the sixth consecutive month.
Americans also remained dour on their personal finances, with just 24 percent expecting their finances to improve in January, compared with 25 percent last month.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions rose to the highest level since February at 82.6, from 79.6, while its gauge of consumer expectations rose to 68.4 from 63.6.

HEADLINE: For a Lover of Traveling and Languages, Only One Place Can Be Called Home

BYLINE: By MATHEW R. WARREN

 BODY:
When Alayne O'Reilly looks out the window of her 17th-floor apartment in Greenwich Village and watches the planes go by, she wonders where they are heading. She imagines she knows their destinations, excited by the thought of going to other countries and hearing the different languages.
''I love languages,'' Dr. O'Reilly, 75, said in her home of nearly 40 years, surrounded by two black-and-white cats, Tiger and Nuala, and books on all sides. ''Every language has its own music.''
Dr. O'Reilly says she has studied French, Spanish, German, Italian, Greek, Latin, Chinese and Russian. After graduating from Barnard College in 1956 with a major in economics, she spent a year and a half working and traveling through Europe. When she returned, she took a job as a recruiter for Barnard and sat in on Russian classes. 
The Russian language captivated her. She decided to pursue a master's degree in Slavic studies and Russian language and literature at Barnard. Then it was on to a Ph.D. at New York University. She received a fellowship through the National Defense Education Act and was determined to become a professor.
''I loved the feeling that I now had a goal I was going to go for,'' Dr. O'Reilly said.
By the time she finished her doctorate, in 1969, she had published her thesis on contemporary Soviet literature and had married a surgeon she met while in school. Everything would go according to plan from then on -- or so she thought.
''You've got a path and it looks very clear, and suddenly, when you get to the other side, you're stumbling on a rock you didn't see,'' Dr. O'Reilly said, her zebra-print pants matching the coats of her cats. ''I've given up planning because little seems to turn out the way I thought it would.''
Dr. O'Reilly was working as an adjunct professor, teaching a class on Dostoyevsky, at Fordham University in 1971 when she became pregnant. She expected to return to teaching soon after she gave birth. But 13 days after her daughter was born, doctors discovered the infant had a congenital heart defect. Her daughter had emergency heart surgery and remained on life support for six weeks.
''Being a mother became my priority,'' Dr. O'Reilly said. ''I loved her more than anything in the world, and I was not about to give up on her.''
Her daughter had a second heart surgery at age 2 and another when she was 10. In 1973, Dr. O'Reilly had a second daughter, and continued to be a full-time mother until her children grew up and left home. By then, she and her husband had divorced, and she was on her own.
Dr. O'Reilly took a job as a secretary at a publishing house, and to help cover the rent for her two-bedroom apartment in the Village, she began taking in roommates, renting exclusively to N.Y.U. graduate students.
''They're more reliable, and they're serious,'' she said. ''Their priority is their education, not partying and having a good time.''
She added: ''At my age, I'm not going to go to Craigslist and bring someone in who I don't know what they're doing. I think I'm sort of helping the younger students go on their way.''
But in 2008, she lost her job when the publisher downsized. The only work she could find was a temporary job with the Census Bureau. By summer 2010, her unemployment benefits had run out. It was terrible timing: She also found herself without a roommate.
Dr. O'Reilly's rent-stabilized apartment is $2,061 a month; a roommate usually pays $1,250. She receives $701 a month in Social Security benefits. During the month she was without a roommate, she could not make up the difference in rent, and fell behind. She said she could not afford to move. ''For what I pay,'' she said, ''I would be in a closet in Jersey City.''
Dr. O'Reilly said her daughters, who live on the West Coast, could not help her. One works in a bookstore, and the other is a dance instructor.
Afraid of becoming homeless, Dr. O'Reilly sought help at the Caring Community senior center where she had been attending language classes. A social worker there referred her to the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. With a grant of $1,283 from the fund, she was able to cover her arrears.
Dr. O'Reilly, who has found a new roommate, now receives $200 a month in food stamps and a monthly stipend of $752 from a nonprofit organization that provides financial support to the elderly. She said she took great comfort in knowing that she could remain in her home.
''I don't know what I would have done had all that good stuff not happened,'' Dr. O'Reilly said, staring out the window as her cats competed for her affection. ''I have angels that work overtime.''
''I've become more relaxed in my old age. As my grandmother used to say,'' she added, affecting an Irish accent, '' 'Tis a great life if you don't weaken.' ''

HEADLINE: Japan's Prime Minister Shuffles Cabinet in a Bid for Tax Support

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- As part of a reshuffling aimed at winning support for a tax increase to trim the nation's soaring debt, Japan's prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, removed his gaffe-prone defense minister on Friday and replaced 5 of the 17 ministers in his cabinet. 
One was the former defense minister, Yasuo Ichikawa, who had been censured by the opposition after boasting that he knew little about the 1995 rape of a schoolgirl by three American servicemen on Okinawa, a crime that caused a backlash against American bases on the island.
Other crucial posts, like the ministers of finance and foreign affairs, were left unchanged in the new cabinet, which was formally installed with a ceremony on Friday night presided over by Emperor Akihito.
Such reshufflings are common in Japan when a leader wants to mark a big policy push or change in direction. Mr. Noda hopes to give new political momentum to his efforts to rein in Japan's debt, one of the largest among developed nations. He has also pledged to shore up the underfinanced pension system to pay for this rapidly graying nation's growing legions of retirees.
Mr. Noda wants to pay for all this by raising Japan's national sales tax to 8 percent in 2013, from its current 5 percent, and then to 10 percent in 2014. In one crucial addition to his new cabinet, Mr. Noda appointed Katsuya Okada, a party veteran and former foreign minister, as deputy prime minister to lead the tax effort.
However, Mr. Noda's tax plans have run into stiff resistance from opposition parties, which control the upper house of Parliament, as well as from members of his own governing Democratic Party. The ouster of the defense minister appeared to be a conciliatory gesture aimed at the main opposition Liberal Democrats, who had vowed to reject any tax increases until Mr. Ichikawa was removed.
Mr. Ichikawa's comment had also incited renewed anger on Okinawa, complicating Mr. Noda's efforts to move a Marine air base to a new location on the island. Delays in relocating the Futenma base have become a sore point in Washington's relations with Tokyo, its most important Asian ally.
It remained unclear whether Friday's cabinet changes would be enough to smooth passage of the tax increase. Mr. Noda must still win over dissenting members of his own party, who include a former party powerbroker, Ichiro Ozawa.
These Democrats have questioned the wisdom of raising taxes at a time when Japan's already lackluster economy must weather a drop in exports because of the European debt crisis and the cost of rebuilding the tsunami-ravaged northeast. Several lawmakers have already left the governing party in recent weeks, citing opposition to the tax increase as one reason.
Mr. Noda has also seen his approval ratings slide to below 40 percent from their previous level near 50 percent in what some analysts have interpreted as a show of public displeasure with the planned tax increase.

HEADLINE: Council Speaker Unveils Compromise on Wage Bill

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
After months of heated debate over whether New York City should mandate a so-called living wage for workers in city-subsidized projects, the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, unveiled a proposal on Friday that would raise wages for some workers in such projects.
The compromise proposal would exclude employees of commercial tenants in subsidized developments, like retail workers, who had in many ways been the main focus of the bill's advocates. 
In a news conference at City Hall, Ms. Quinn said she would introduce legislation next month that would mandate a living wage -- $10 an hour with benefits, or $11.50 an hour without benefits -- for employees of businesses that directly receive city subsidies, as well as for employees of on-site contractors and subcontractors in city-subsidized developments.
For example, employees of companies that provide cafeteria or mailroom services in subsidized developments would benefit because many of those workers are currently paid the state's $7.25 hourly minimum wage.
Manufacturers, businesses with less than $5 million in annual revenue and businesses receiving less than $1 million in subsidies would not be affected by the legislation.
In addition, Ms. Quinn said the Council would create a fund in its capital budget, of $3 million to $10 million, to sweeten incentives for developers who agreed to apply the living-wage requirement to tenants.
''This is a policy that is fair, one that will help workers, will not deter job growth and is one that I am honored to support,'' she said.
Ms. Quinn estimated that the new bill would affect 400 to 500 workers in new developments each year, while the broader version of the legislation would have affected 600 to 700 a year. She said projects in the pipeline, including a deal being negotiated to lure the online grocer Fresh Direct to the Bronx, would be excluded from the living-wage requirement. Critics of Fresh Direct have said it pays low wages and obstructs its workers' efforts to organize.
Ms. Quinn's handling of the living-wage issue has been closely watched. A likely candidate for mayor in 2013, she entered public service after years as a liberal activist but recently has also courted support from the business community.
Some business leaders, as well as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, have criticized living-wage legislation as a deterrent to economic development and job creation, while labor and liberal organizations have supported it as a way of improving the economic situation of low-wage workers.
Ms. Quinn, speaking alongside labor and business leaders and a dozen Council members, said Friday that she had concluded that she could not support the legislation already pending, which would have raised wages for all workers in subsidized developments, including employees of commercial tenants in those developments. Real estate officials had said that such a requirement would make affected developments impossible to lease.
At the news conference, Ms. Quinn was praised by advocates of the original bill -- including Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, and Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president -- as well as Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a network of business leaders.
It was unclear, however, whether Mr. Bloomberg, who said this week that he would support raising the state's minimum wage, would support the more limited living-wage bill.
Julie Wood, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said, ''While we appreciate the positive changes Speaker Quinn has made to this legislation, we continue to have serious concerns about the impact it could have on reducing the number of jobs in New York City.''
The living-wage compromise was the second time in a week that advocates for low-wage workers had decided to bow to political necessity.
Earlier, Mr. Diaz and Mr. Bloomberg agreed to revive efforts to redevelop the long-vacant Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx, two years after a previous development deal collapsed in the face of opposition from Mr. Diaz and the retail workers' union. The opponents had demanded that workers at the development be paid a living wage.
The new request for proposals for the armory, like the earlier one, includes a preference for developments that create living-wage jobs, but not a requirement.

HEADLINE: Israel Says Sanctions Hurt Iran

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER; William J. Broad and Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said in an interview published Saturday that new economic sanctions aimed at stopping Iran's contentious nuclear program appeared to be having an effect and, if combined with a threat of military action led by the United States, could succeed.
''For the first time, I see Iran wobble,'' he told the newspaper The Australian in Jerusalem, particularly citing sanctions on the central bank. He said if ''coupled with a clear statement from the international community led by the U.S. to act militarily to stop Iran if the sanctions fail, Iran may consider not going through the pain. There's no point in gritting your teeth if you're going to be stopped anyway. 
''In any case, the Iranian economy is showing signs of strain.''
Israel has been pressing for tough sanctions against Iran's oil and banking industry, saying they were the only diplomatic measures that could force it to stop its nuclear program, which Israel and the West suspect is a cover for developing a nuclear weapon despite Iran's denials.
Concerns have been expressed that Israel might use force to stop the Iranian program. Those concerns have grown recently, as Iran has begun to move some uranium enrichment to a more secure location.
At the same time, a covert war is being waged against Iranian nuclear scientists -- one was killed this week -- and it is widely thought to be led by Israel. Officials here are not commenting.
Iran has vowed to retaliate. It also has accused the United States of complicity and called upon the United Nations to denounce the killing. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, in his first response to Iran's outrage, said Friday that ''any terrorist action or assassination of any people, whether scientist or civilian, is to be strongly condemned.''
One question that has troubled American-Israeli relations in recent months is whether the two countries agree on the threat of the Iranian program and on the steps needed to stop it. Mr. Netanyahu's comments are the most explicit to date to suggest that little division exists between the two governments on diplomatic and economic sanctions. Israeli officials e-mailed the Netanyahu interview to news correspondents. President Obama recently signed legislation imposing sanctions against Iran's central bank intended to impede Iranian oil sales. The European Union has moved toward an oil embargo.
The Iranian rial has been steadily weakening in recent weeks as sanctions have led to concerns over economic isolation. The Iranians have labeled the sanctions and threats as ''economic war.'' They have also threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz.
The Iranians have said they are open to further talks on the nuclear issue. They have also suggested willingness to allow a visit by a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which accused Iran in a November report of behaviors that suggested it was working toward acquiring the ability to make a nuclear weapon. Diplomats in Vienna, where the agency is based, said Friday that the agency was negotiating with Iran to have senior officials visit and discuss the accusations.
Iran has ridiculed those accusations. But diplomats say that it has never engaged in substantive discussions of the evidence. The target date for the visit, said a diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity, is toward the end of the month.
''What would be unusual is if they actually discuss the substance of the military allegations,'' the diplomat said. ''In effect, they are already discussing this by arranging the meeting.''

HEADLINE: For Many Latinos, Racial Identity Is More Culture Than Color

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Every decade, the Census Bureau spends billions of dollars and deploys hundreds of thousands of workers to get an accurate portrait of the American population. Among the questions on the census form is one about race, with 15 choices, including ''some other race.''
More than 18 million Latinos checked this ''other'' box in the 2010 census, up from 14.9 million in 2000. It was an indicator of the sharp disconnect between how Latinos view themselves and how the government wants to count them. Many Latinos argue that the country's race categories -- indeed, the government's very conception of identity -- do not fit them.
The main reason for the split is that the census categorizes people by race, which typically refers to a set of common physical traits. But Latinos, as a group in this country, tend to identify themselves more by their ethnicity, meaning a shared set of cultural traits, like language or customs. 
So when they encounter the census, they see one question that asks them whether they identify themselves as having Hispanic ethnic origins and many answer it as their main identifier. But then there is another question, asking them about their race, because, as the census guide notes, ''people of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin may be of any race,'' and more than a third of Latinos check ''other.''
This argument over identity has gained momentum with the growth of the Latino population, which in 2010 stood at more than 50 million. Census Bureau officials have acknowledged that the questionnaire has a problem, and say they are wrestling with how to get more Latinos to pick a race. In 2010, they tested different wording in questions and last year they held focus groups, with a report on the research scheduled to be released by this summer.
Some experts say officials are right to go back to the drawing table. ''Whenever you have people who can't find themselves in the question, it's a bad question,'' said Mary C. Waters, a sociology professor at Harvard who specializes in the challenges of measuring race and ethnicity.
The problem is more than academic -- the census data on race serves many purposes, including determining the makeup of voting districts, and monitoring discriminatory practices in hiring and racial disparities in education and health. When respondents do not choose a race, the Census Bureau assigns them one, based on factors like the racial makeup of their neighborhood, inevitably leading to a less accurate count.
Latinos, who make up close to 20 percent of the American population, generally hold a fundamentally different view of race. Many Latinos say they are too racially mixed to settle on one of the government-sanctioned standard races -- white, black, American Indian, Alaska native, native Hawaiian, and a collection of Asian and Pacific Island backgrounds.
Some regard white or black as separate demographic groups from Latino. Still others say Latinos are already the equivalent of another race in this country, defined by a shared set of challenges.
''The issues within the Latino community -- language, immigration status -- do not take into account race,'' said Peter L. Cedeno, 43, a lawyer and native New Yorker born to Dominican immigrants. ''We share the same hurdles.''
At a time when many multiracial Americans are proudly asserting their mixed-race identity, many Latinos, an overwhelmingly blended population with Indian, European, African and other roots, are sidestepping or ignoring questions of race.
Erica Lubliner, who has fair skin and green eyes -- legacies of her Jewish father and her Mexican mother -- said she was so ''conflicted'' about the race question on the census form that she left it blank.
Ms. Lubliner, a recent graduate of the medical school at the University of California, Los Angeles, in her mid-30s, was only 9 when her father died, and she grew up steeped in the language and culture of her mother. She said she has never identified with ''the dominant culture of white.'' She believes her mother is a mix of white and Indian. ''Believe me, I am not a confused person,'' she said. ''I know who I am, but I don't necessarily fit the categories well.''
Alejandro Farias, 23, from Brownsville, Tex., a supervisor for a freight company, sees himself simply as Latino. His ancestors came from the United States, Mexico and Portugal. When pressed, he checked ''some other race.''
''Race to me gets very confusing because we have so many people from so many races that make up our genealogical tree,'' he said.
Yet race matters. How Latinos identify themselves -- and how the census counts them -- affects the political clout of Latinos and other minority groups. Some studies have found that African-Latinos tend to be significantly more supportive of government-sponsored health care and much less supportive of the death penalty than Latinos who identify as white, a rift that is also found in the broader white and black populations.
This racial effect ''weakens the political effectiveness of Latinos as a group,'' said Gary M. Segura, a political science professor at Stanford who has conducted some of the research.
A majority of Latinos identify themselves as white. Among them is Fiordaliza A. Rodriguez, 40, a New York lawyer who says she considers herself white because ''I am light-skinned'' and that is how she is viewed in her native Dominican Republic.
But she says there is no question that she is seen as different from the white majority in this country. Ms. Rodriguez recalled an occasion in a courtroom when a white lawyer assumed she was the court interpreter. She surmised the confusion had to do with ethnic stereotyping, ''no matter how well you're dressed.''
Some of the latest research, however, shows that many Latinos -- like Irish and Italian immigrants before them -- drop the Latino label to call themselves simply ''white.'' A study published last year in the Journal of Labor Economics found that the parents of more than a quarter of third-generation children with Mexican ancestry do not identify their children as Latino on census forms.
Most of this ethnic attrition occurs among the offspring of parents or grandparents married to non-Mexicans, usually non-Hispanic whites. These Latinos tend to have high education, high earnings and high levels of English fluency. That means that many successful Latinos are no longer present in statistics tracking Latino economic and social progress across generations, hence many studies showing little or no progress for third-generation Mexican immigrants, said Stephen J. Trejo, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin and co-author of the study.
And a more recent study by University of Southern California researchers found that more than two million people, or 6 percent of those who claimed any type of Latin American ancestry on census surveys, did not ultimately identify as Latino or Hispanic. The trend was more prevalent among those of mixed parentage, who spoke only English and who identified as white, black or Asian when asked their race.
James Paine, whose father is half Mexican-American, said it never occurred to him to claim a Latino identity. Mr. Paine, 25, the owner of a real estate investment management company in La Jolla, Calif., spent summers with his Mexican-American aunt and attends his father's big family reunions every year (his mother is white of Irish and French descent). But he says he does not speak Spanish or live in a Latino neighborhood.
''If the question is 'What's your heritage?' I'd say Irish-Mexican,'' he said. ''But the question is 'What are you?' and the answer is I'm white.''
On the other side of the spectrum are black Latinos, who say they feel the sting of racism much the same as other blacks. A sense of racial pride has been emerging among many black Latinos who are now coming together in conferences and organizations.
Miriam Jimenez Roman, 60, a scholar on race and ethnicity in New York, says that issues like racial profiling of indigenous-looking and dark-skinned Latinos led her to appear in a 30-second public service announcement before the 2010 census encouraging Latinos of African descent to ''check both: Latino and black.'' ''When you sit on the subway, you just see a black person, and that's really what determines the treatment,'' she said. The 2010 census showed 1.2 million Latinos who identified as black, or 2.5 percent of the Hispanic population.
Over the decades, the Census Bureau has repeatedly altered how it asks the race question, and on the 2010 form, it added a sentence spelling out that ''Hispanic origins are not races.'' The change helped steer 5 percent more Latinos away from ''some other race,'' with the vast majority of those choosing the white category.
Still, critics of the census questionnaire say the government must move on from racial distinctions based on 18th-century binary thinking and adapt to Americans' sense of self.
But Latino political leaders say the risk in changing the questions could create confusion and lead some Latinos not to mark their ethnicity, shrinking the overall Hispanic numbers.
Ultimately, said Angelo Falcon, president of the National Institute for Latino Policy and chairman of the Census Advisory Committee on the Hispanic Population, this is not just a tussle over identity, it is a political battle, too.
''It comes down to what yields the largest numbers for which group,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Japan's Problems

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Myth of Japan's Failure,'' by Eamonn Fingleton (Sunday Review, Jan. 8): 
Japan is now a shrinking, more insular and less relevant nation. Its birthrate dwindles because women don't want to raise children in a society where husbands are forced by corporate loyalties to be absentee parents. Its suicide rate, at nearly 25 per 100,000, is among the world's highest. Thousands of its rural towns are dens of lonely elderly without the youthful infrastructure to sustain their longevity.
Its political system has been shorn of credibility. Its fiscal deficit is far larger than our own, more than twice its gross domestic product. Japan's old-boy system of corporate cronyism and top-down control continues to flourish, as the current Olympus scandal demonstrates.
The Fukushima disaster proved again the nation's inability to properly manage a foreseeable crisis. Dodging responsibility, not demanding accountability, remains the ''Japanese way.''
Japan's unique culture of conformity, insularity, sacrifice and order was superbly suited for a 20th-century paradigm of mass production and hardware, but has great difficulty adapting to a 21st century dominated by personalization, individuality and software.
America's new fragility does not somehow make Japan stronger. Ask those thousands of young Japanese men and women who now choose to live in Brooklyn or San Francisco. They are seeking the personal empowerment that Japan systematically rejects.

HEADLINE: Middle East Trip Suggests Change in Policy by China

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Premier Wen Jiabao heads on Saturday to the oil-producing nations of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, a six-day tour of Iran's Persian Gulf neighbors that is the first Saudi trip by a Chinese premier in two decades, and the first ever to the other two states.
But some experts find the trip notable for a different reason: It comes as China's strategic alliance with Iran is less certain than before. 
No one outside China's leadership knows what Mr. Wen will discuss with leaders of the three oil-rich states he is visiting, but relations with Iran -- deeply feared and resented by the Saudis, somewhat less so by the others -- are certain to come up.
For decades, Iran has offered China a generous supply of oil and a foothold in an American-dominated Middle East. In return it received a lucrative trade relationship and a powerful defender in the United Nations and other diplomatic circles. The latest Iranian crisis puts that comfortable arrangement under new strains, some analysts say.
Foremost is the United States' request that China slash its purchases of Iranian oil or, under legislation just signed by President Obama, potentially face the exclusion of many of its financial institutions from the American financial system. Although the White House has wide leeway in choosing targets for enforcement, the law is by far the toughest measure aimed at pressuring Iran over its nuclear program in recent times.
The willingness of the European Union and others to consider aggressively cutting oil purchases puts the Chinese in the awkward position of bucking most of the West's largest economies -- to preserve its ties to Iran. And the history of the last year -- in which seemingly secure Arab allies like Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, another important supplier of oil, were swept out of power -- throws a new element of uncertainty into China's commitment.
Chinese leaders who pored over the Soviet Union's demise for clues to preserving their own hold on power are unlikely to ignore the lessons of the Arab Spring. The Chinese government may also be more cautious about the side it chooses, considering the embarrassment caused when the biggest state-owned arms company was found to have offered to sell weapons to Colonel Qaddafi to put down the uprising.
''Their political influence has gone down a lot in the last year. Libya, Yemen, Syria -- those are all states which had either good or very good relations with China,'' said Francois Godement, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Paris. ''In that mood, it's quite possible that the Chinese would decide to hedge.''
Joseph S. Nye Jr., a Harvard professor who held security and intelligence posts in the Carter and Clinton administrations, said he agreed. ''The more this Iranian crutch looks weak, or weakening, the less they're going to stick with it.''
China already has reduced the oil it buys from Iran, a move that may be aimed at trying to negotiate more favorable financing terms, or perhaps to also satisfy American demands.
There are powerful counterarguments: Iran is China's third-biggest source of oil imports, supplying more than 5 percent of total needs. Beijing would normally balk at crimping such an important oil source in a year when its economy already shows signs of slowing. China is also Iran's largest oil purchaser and trading partner, and a vocal expatriate community there argues vigorously against policy changes, experts say.
Beijing normally would be especially reluctant to change a significant foreign-policy strategy this year, when a pending transfer of power from Mr. Wen and President Hu Jintao has all but frozen boat-rocking initiatives.
And its network of government research organizations --whose policy papers often reflect the analyses being given government leaders -- often depict Iran as a rising power displacing a declining United States that is struggling to keep its grip on the Middle East's oil. Their frequent conclusion is that time is on Iran's, and thus on China's, side.
Seemingly without equivocation, China's official statements last week rejected joining an American sanctions regime and called for more talks over the scope of Iran's nuclear program. Yet the Obama administration appears to believe it can get the Chinese to press Iran, both by cutting its oil purchases and by other means, before enforcement of the new sanctions legislation begins in June.
Whether that is right is in doubt. Many experts say China's interest lies in straddling the divide between Tehran and Washington.
''To maintain positive relations with the United States is essential -- indeed, a key for China's macro long-term development drive. And that drive is essential to the regime's survival and to social stability,'' said John Garver, a expert on Chinese-Iranian issues at Georgia Tech's Sam Nunn School of International Affairs.
''If it was a question of Chinese firms being excluded from American markets, of China becoming an issue in the American presidential election and a souring of American public opinion on China, then they would have to consider their options,'' he said.
The slowing global economy could give China some leeway to accommodate American demands. Beijing's thirst for oil is likely to slacken this year, leaving it some room to purchase less from Iran without openly endorsing efforts to ostracize Tehran.
In the end, however, foreign policy in China, as elsewhere, rests on a clear-eyed calculation of the government's best interests. And that depends on Beijing's judgment of the viability of the current Iranian government, several analysts said.
''I think the Chinese are extremely sensitive to getting caught in a situation they cannot get out of,'' Mr. Godement said. ''In Iran, the quantity of Chinese investment is huge. You handle that by being slow, and reluctant to move.
''But you don't want to be the last to move.''

HEADLINE: Debt Ratings Cut For 9 Countries Amid Euro Woes

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN and RACHEL DONADIO; David Jolly and Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Paris, Landon Thomas Jr. from London and Gaia Pianigiani from Rome.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Standard & Poor's downgraded the credit ratings of France, Italy and seven other European countries on Friday, a move that may have more symbolic than fundamental financial impact but served as a reminder that Europe's economic woes were far from over.
Another memory jog came Friday from Greece, the original source of Europe's debt troubles. Talks hit a snag between the new Greek government and the banks and other private investors that Athens hopes will agree to take losses on their debt so that Greece can avoid a default.
Together, those developments underscore that even as Europe's debt turmoil enters its third year, no clear solutions are yet in sight -- despite recent signs that a new lending program by the European Central Bank might be easing financial market pressures.
S.& P. warned in December that it might downgrade many of the 17 nations that share the euro, largely because it said European politicians were moving too slowly to strengthen the monetary union and because the euro zone's problems were propelling Europe toward its second recession in three years. 
European politicians, in turn, criticized S.& P.'s downgrade plans as providing no meaningful new information to investors but simply stoking a sense of crisis.
To some extent, the prospect of rating downgrades has already been priced into recent bond auctions by Italy, Spain and other countries. Italy, in fact, completed another fairly successful bond auction on Friday, even as rumors of the downgrades had begun to swirl.
But the downgrades may now add to the borrowing costs of the nations affected. Some commercial banks that are required to hold only the highest-rated government securities will have to replace French bonds with other assets, like bonds of Germany.
And the downgrades cannot help but add to the gloom pervading Europe's economic climate.
''Today's rating actions are primarily driven by our assessment that the policy initiatives that have been taken by European policy makers in recent weeks may be insufficient to fully address ongoing systemic stresses in the euro zone,'' S.&. P said.
Finance Minister Francois Baroin of France said Friday that the loss of his country's pristine AAA rating, cut a notch to AA+, was ''not good news'' but was ''not a catastrophe.'' He insisted that the country was headed in the right direction and that no ratings agency would dictate the policies of France, which has Europe's second-biggest economy, behind Germany's.
But the downgrades pose fresh challenges for Europe's political leaders, particularly President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who is expected to run for re-election this spring and had long cited his country's AAA credit rating as a badge of honor.
In August, when S.& P. cut the United States a notch from its top-rank AAA rating, markets briefly plunged. But bond investors have continued to flock to the debt of the United States, which as the world's largest economy has retained the perception of a financial safe haven. That has kept the United States government's interest rates at very low levels. But none of the countries downgraded on Friday can necessarily count on such a reaction.
After Friday, the only euro zone nations retaining their top AAA ratings are Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Luxembourg.
Italy and Spain, which are considered the two big euro-zone economies most vulnerable to an escalation of debt problems, both were downgraded two notches, Italy to BBB+ and Spain to A.
''It will make it harder to erect firewalls around struggling euro zone economies and convince investors that things are more sustainable,'' said Simon Tilford, the chief economist for the Center for European Reform in London.
Stocks were down broadly if not deeply in Europe and the United States on Friday, as rumors of the downgrades preceded S.& P.'s announcement, which came after the close of trading on Wall Street. And the euro fell to a 16-month low against the dollar.
Just as significant as the ratings downgrades may be the suspension on Friday of the creditor talks in Greece -- whose debt S.& P. long ago gave junk status.
In October, the European Union pledged to write off 100 billion euros ($127.8 billion) of Greece's debt if bondholders would agree to voluntarily accept 50 percent losses on their Greek holdings. Such an arrangement, known as private-sector involvement, or P.S.I., has been pushed by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany as a way of forcing banks, not only European taxpayers, to foot the bill for bailing out Greece.
But talks broke down on Friday between Greece and the commercial banks.
''Discussions with Greece and the official sector are paused for reflection on the benefits of a voluntary approach,'' the Institute of International Finance, which negotiates on behalf of the banks, said in a statement on Friday, after its leader, Charles Dallara, left Athens.
''Unfortunately, despite the efforts of Greece's leadership, the proposal put forward,'' the statement added, ''has not produced a constructive consolidated response by all parties.''
The reference to a ''voluntary approach'' might be a not-so-subtle message that if Europe pushed too hard on this point, then the creditors could no longer accept the agreement as a voluntary one. That is crucial, because an involuntary debt revamping would be seen by creditors as a default -- a step Greece and Europe are trying hard to avoid.
If Greece defaults, it could set off the activation of credit default swaps -- a type of financial insurance. If the issuers of that insurance have to start paying up, many analysts fear the same sort of falling dominoes of i.o.u.'s that cascaded through the financial industry after the subprime mortgage market collapsed in the United States in 2007 and 2008.
Talks are expected to resume next week. If Greece fails to persuade enough bondholders to take voluntary losses, it may pass a law activating clauses in the bonds that would force creditors to take losses.
''We should be ready, if we don't have 100 percent participation and if Europe doesn't want to give us more money,'' Christos Staikouras, a member of the Greek Parliament from the center-right New Democracy opposition party and its economic spokesman, said in an interview.
The tense negotiations over Greece's debt come as the Greek government struggles to find a consensus to pass the budget reforms demanded by its so-called troika of lenders -- the European Central Bank, European Union and International Monetary Fund -- in exchange for releasing the next installment of bailout money, a 30 billion euro ($38.3 billion) payout scheduled to be released in March.
The Greek uncertainties only add to the regional doubt that helped set off the S.& P. downgrades. Europe's economy, having barely clawed its way out of a recession three years ago, is again tipping into a new one. France, Spain, Greece and Portugal are already in recessions, and Italy is expected to head into one as a result of belt-tightening measures being pushed by its new prime minister, Mario Monti.
Austria, the other country whose AAA rating was cut a notch on Friday, could be in for trouble if the political turmoil in neighboring Hungary affects Austrian banks, S.& P. said.
Even mighty Germany, with most of its neighbors in a downturn, is also expected to slip into a shallow recession this year. On Friday, S.& P. kept Germany's ratings untouched, citing its continued competitiveness and financial rigor. But it said it could lower Germany's rating if its debt, now 80 percent of gross domestic product, reached 100 percent.

HEADLINE: After 4 Days of Gains, Shares Slip Backward

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks snapped a four-day winning streak on Friday after news reports that Standard & Poor's would downgrade credit ratings on several euro zone countries.
''This is going to destabilize a lot of those funding packages because they are all based on the AAA rating, and now you are going to have AA+ for France and Austria, and maybe down two notches for Italy,'' said Alan Valdes, director of floor operations for DME Securities in New York.
The slide on Friday came as investors' focus shifted back to the euro zone's debt crisis. 
After the markets closed in the United States, S.& P. followed through with downgrades of France and Austria as well as seven other members of the 17-nation euro zone.
In recent days, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had reached five-month highs on the back of solid economic data in the United States. The tight relationship between American stocks and the euro has broken down in recent weeks, a sign investors have placed less emphasis on the euro zone's woes.
The Friday sell-off shows Europe's debt problems can still make American investors skittish, though indexes finished well higher than the day's lows.
Banks led the decline, as the impending downgrades and lackluster earnings from JPMorgan Chase drove those shares lower. The S.& P. financial index fell 0.8 percent, making it the worst performer of the 10 major sectors.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 48.96 points, or 0.39 percent, to close at 12,422.06. The S.& P. 500 lost 6.41 points, or 0.49 percent, to 1,289.09. The Nasdaq composite index fell 14.03 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,710.67.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.5 percent, while the S.& P. 500 advanced 0.9 percent, and the Nasdaq gained 1.4 percent.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 16/32, to 100 5/32. The yield fell to 1.87 percent, from 1.93 percent late Thursday.
Investors will look to earnings next week for insight on how the euro zone's debt woes may affect profits.
''If you get a weak recession or deep recession in Europe, it is going to hurt our companies and bring our market right back down,'' Mr. Valdes said.
JPMorgan Chase slid 2.5 percent, to $35.92 after the bank said that its fourth-quarter profit fell as the European debt crisis weighed on trading and corporate deal-making. Jamie Dimon, its chief executive, expressed renewed concerns about the euro zone debt crisis.
The KBW index of bank stocks slipped 0.4 percent, after a streak of gains. The index was still up more than 10 percent for the year.
Bank of America shares fell 2.7 percent, to $6.61. Goldman Sachs lost 2.2 percent, to $98.96.
Volume was light with about 6.39 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, N.Y.S.E. Amex and Nasdaq, below the average of 6.68 billion.
The euro fell to a 17-month low on worries of the ratings cuts in the euro zone countries. The downgrade concerns overshadowed a successful sale of Italian debt.
''Things have not been improving in Europe. The timing is not perfect. It is sort of like kicking someone when they are down,'' said William Larkin, fixed income portfolio manager at Cabot Money Management in Salem, Mass.
World stocks as measured by the MSCI World Equity Index slipped 0.6 percent after earlier falling more than 1 percent.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares fell 0.1 percent, to close at 1,017.84 points.
Underpinned by a flood of European Central Bank three-year loans to banks, Italy's three-year debt costs fell below 5 percent for the first time since September in an auction, spurring hopes it would make it through a stretch of looming refinancing.
Gold fell as the dollar surged against the euro.
Spot gold was down 1 percent, to $1,630.40 an ounce.
''The dollar seems to be the main go-to safe-haven play at the moment,'' said David Meger, director of metals trading at futures brokerage Vision Financial Markets.
Oil prices also fell. Oil futures for March delivery dropped 43 cents, to $98.88 in New York.

HEADLINE: Lending Helps JPMorgan, But 4th Quarter Was Soft

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and PETER EAVIS. 
Floyd Norris, whose Off the Charts column normally appears on this page, is away.

 BODY:
Wall Street, more than three years after the financial crisis, has loosened its lending tap. Consumers, however, have yet to reap the benefits.
Results announced on Friday by the nation's strongest and biggest bank by assets, JPMorgan Chase, point to a divided economy where big businesses are gaining ground while consumers still cannot find their footing.
JPMorgan reported a weak fourth quarter, with earnings down 23 percent compared with the period a year earlier. The bank was hurt by a fourth-quarter slump in investment banking and other Wall Street businesses, which suffered amid the sluggish economic recovery and worries that the European debt crisis will spread. 
One significant bright spot was the bank's growth in corporate loans. The commercial banking unit's profits rose to $643 million, a 21 percent increase from the previous year, as lending to corporations grew for the sixth consecutive quarter.
The strong results helped JPMorgan turn a $19 billion profit for 2011, up 9 percent from a year earlier.
The bank's chairman and chief executive, Jamie Dimon, emphasized the uptick in lending. ''I believe that you are seeing real loan growth,'' Mr. Dimon said on a conference call with journalists. ''And I think that will continue.''
The credit surge rippled through corporate America and the nonprofit world, too, as the bank lent to entities as varied as major corporations, hospitals, universities and local governments. Last year, JPMorgan lent $58 million to a cancer research center in Washington State. The bank also lent $17 billion to small businesses in the United States, a 52 percent leap.
''All types of corporations'' are taking out loans, Mr. Dimon said, ''large, small, medium, all types.''
But the figures highlight the differences between the corporate and consumer economies.
The bank's student loans dipped more than 7 percent last year. Auto loans dropped nearly 2 percent. JPMorgan's credit card lending fell 2.5 percent, to $132.2 billion at the end of 2011, though such loans rose 5 percent in the second half of the year.
''The consumer is still deleveraging,'' said Jason Goldberg, a senior analyst with Barclays. ''It's not a lack of supply; it's a lack of demand.''
While consumers are reluctant to take on extra debt when the economic outlook is uncertain, banks like JPMorgan also remain wary of increasing their exposure to individual borrowers, particularly potential homeowners.
JPMorgan made 765,000 mortgages in 2011, but, like other banks, it sells most of them to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled housing finance companies. Banks must hold layers of capital against mortgages they keep on their balance sheets, so selling to Fannie and Freddie can be an attractive alternative to holding them.
Nearly 90 percent of all mortgages made in the first nine months of 2011 wound up at a government agency, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry trade magazine.
The reluctance of banks to keep control of mortgages underscores how distant a recovery is in the home loan market. JPMorgan's holdings of mortgages to people with stronger credit rose by just 2 percent in 2011, to $76.2 billion, while its home equity loans fell 12 percent.
''We're getting killed in mortgages, in case you hadn't noticed,'' Mr. Dimon said on Friday.
Banks also face a reckoning for their lax lending standards during the mortgage bubble. A wave of lawsuits, filed by Fannie, Freddie and private mortgage investors alike, has loomed large on the business since the dark days of the financial crisis. JPMorgan last quarter recorded a $528 million expense for restocking its mortgage litigation reserves.
''There's going to be a long tail to this real estate cycle,'' Mr. Goldberg said. ''This could go on for years.''
Still, JPMorgan on Friday highlighted some encouraging signs for its consumer divisions. The bank set aside $730 million in fewer reserves for loan losses, as its credit card portfolio showed signs of life. That decision also increased earnings for Chase retail financial services, the bank's consumer banking arm that offers services like mortgages and checking accounts. The unit earned $533 million in the fourth quarter, up from $459 million a year earlier.
JPMorgan, for all its lingering mortgage issues, has emerged from the financial crisis as one of Wall Street's most dominant banks. In 2011, JPMorgan stripped Bank of America of its title as the nation's biggest bank by assets.
Bank of America is struggling more than any other big bank to shed the legacy of the subprime mortgage mess.
''JPMorgan is in the best position for no other reason than they don't have the troubles that Bank of America has,'' said Jim Sinegal, an analyst with the research firm Morningstar.
But the JPMorgan profit engine stalled in the fourth quarter amid the weak economic conditions and as new federal rules reined in fees tied to overdrafts and debit cards, onetime revenue drivers. Revenue last year fell about 5 percent, to $99.77 billion, from $104.84 billion a year earlier.
Mr. Dimon, perhaps Wall Street's most vocal opponent of the recent regulatory crackdown, called the debit card restrictions ''a gross miscarriage of justice.''
JPMorgan also disclosed that a $567 million accounting loss weighed down revenue. The investment bank booked the loss in the fourth quarter tied to the perceived riskiness of JPMorgan's own debt, reversing a one-time gain from last quarter that propped up earnings across Wall Street. In all, the investment bank's revenue sank 30 percent in the fourth quarter.
Shares of JPMorgan closed down 2.5 percent, or 93 cents, at $35.92.
The revenue struggles are not unique to JPMorgan, a diversified bank seen as a gauge for the performance of Wall Street. When the nation's other big banks - Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Bank of America - report earnings next week, most are expected to detail similar slowdowns in revenue.
''It's hard to think of a bright spot on the revenue side,'' Mr. Sinegal said. ''That issue is going to linger.''
But Mr. Dimon on Friday offered hints of optimism for his bank - and the broader state of Wall Street and the economy.
''We have a mild recovery that might actually be strengthening,'' he said. And the comeback appears to be ''broad.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. Faces New Challenge Of Fewer Troops in Europe

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and STEVEN ERLANGER; Thom Shanker reported from Washington, and Steven Erlanger from Paris.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With word that the Pentagon will bring two combat brigades home from Germany, the Obama administration faces a challenge to convince Atlantic allies that the military's new orders to refocus on the Asia-Pacific region, while sustaining its role in the Middle East, will not mean abandoning Europe to fit shrinking budgets.
But numbers tell a story. During the height of the cold war, when America's heavily armored and nuclear-tipped force in Europe comforted allies and deterred the Soviet Union, the Army reached a peak of 277,342 troops on the Continent. 
Now, under plans unveiled by Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta on Thursday, the withdrawal of two heavy armor brigades will reduce the Army presence by 10,000 to just 30,000 troops, with a cavalry brigade still based in Germany and an airborne brigade in Italy.
The reductions come as some European leaders and analysts make their case for a sustained American presence on the Continent to deal with uncertainties, including a rambunctious Russia -- even as these same NATO allies are unable or unwilling to increase spending for their own defense. (And Germany will have to absorb the pain of lost local revenue as some American bases close there.)
American officials acknowledge that the global economic crisis, pushing down defense budgets across the alliance, presents a test.
''I think the budget cuts that we're seeing on the other side of the Atlantic and the budget cuts that we will be facing here when it comes to defense will put added pressure on all of us,'' said Julianne Smith, the Pentagon's deputy assistant secretary for European and NATO policy. She said the task now facing the United States and NATO was ''to come up with some innovative ideas under the rubric of 'smart defense,' where we'll have to look at pooling, sharing, multinational procurement, and come up with some innovative approaches on doing more with less in some ways.''
Mr. Panetta and military officials met at the Pentagon over recent days with counterparts from Britain, the Netherlands, Norway and Lithuania to walk those allies through the changes. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will be in Europe next week for private discussions with a range of NATO commanders on the reshaped force posture.
Philip H. Gordon, the State Department's assistant secretary for European affairs, already was visiting capitals on the Continent, reassuring an audience in Berlin this week that ''the United States remains committed to a strong Europe, the collective defense of our NATO allies, and to building and maintaining the capacity and partnerships that allow us to work together on a global scale.''
The Bush administration had also once planned to withdraw the two brigades, but the Obama administration delayed the move as forces based in Europe were needed for the NATO mission in Afghanistan and in Iraq.
Senior officials say the smaller Army presence will focus on sustaining ties with allies through an enhanced series of training rotations and war-game exercises, mostly based in the region of Grafenwohr, Germany.
''We are optimistic about increasing those opportunities for forces to train and exercise with our allies,'' said Lt. Gen. Mark P. Hertling, commander of United States Army forces in Europe. ''Preparing for global employment in unified land operations, strengthening alliances and building partner capacity are consistent with our mission.''
Even senior European officials acknowledge that it is in the best interests of both the United States and the European allies for Washington to reshape its approach to their territory and adapt NATO to the new realities of the 21st century.
The Obama decision on reducing ground forces in Europe ''was not a surprise,'' said one senior French official. ''If some American troops leave Europe, it won't create any political problems,'' he added. ''We don't need a massive presence of U.S. troops. After all, we don't see Russia anymore as an enemy or an adversary, but even as a partner, if a difficult one.''
A second senior French official expressed skepticism that European nations would be prompted to spend more in their own defense, as they should do, he said, because ''no one feels a threat from inside Europe.'' But he also cautioned that only two other NATO nations -- France and Britain -- had the ability to project substantial military power in defense of alliance interests. ''Together we are 70 percent of the projection capacity of Europe,'' the official said, ''and we're both cutting back.''
The Obama administration will make the case that the American military can position itself in ways that enhance security across the Continent, where threats may come as much from terrorism and cyberwarfare as from military attack.
Thus, while the Army withdraws two brigades from Germany, the Navy will add four Aegis-class warships to Rota, Spain, as part of a Europewide system to defend against potential missile attack from Iran. In other new deployments for that European missile-defense system, which is a part of NATO's strategic planning, the United States will build a radar system in Turkey and plant missile interceptors in Romania and Poland.
The two combat brigades remaining in Europe are on standby for security challenges on the Continent, which is viewed as a low risk, but are closer to the Middle East and Africa and could be deployed there. The logistical and support troops remaining also could help Special Operations forces passing through Europe en route to secret missions on that side of the globe.
Members of Congress already are doing their own lobbying, hoping that the brigades returning from Germany will be garrisoned at bases in their home districts in the United States. But it is most likely that as shrinking budgets force the Army to drop from 570,000 to 490,000 personnel over the next decade, that the brigades from Germany will vanish off the roster.

HEADLINE: Bitter Politics of Envy?

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
You're just jealous. At least that's how Mitt Romney sees it. The millionaire who posed for a picture with the boys at Bain Capital with the long green clinched between their teeth and poking out of their collars and jackets now says that people who question what he did there, and what rich people do now, are just green with envy.
In his New Hampshire victory speech on Tuesday, Romney lambasted his Republican opponents (who have raised real issues about his role at the private equity firm Bain Capital) for following the lead of President Obama, whom he described as a leader who divides us ''with the bitter politics of envy.'' 
The next day on ''Today'' on NBC, Romney defended the statement, rejecting the notion that there were questions about Wall Street behavior, saying the whole discussion was about class warfare. He even went so far as to suggest that such talk shouldn't even be openly entertained. When the interviewer asked, ''Are there no fair questions about the distribution of wealth without it being seen as envy, though?'' Romney responded, ''I think it's fine to talk about those things in quiet rooms and discussions about tax policy and the like.''
In quiet rooms? That's the problem. Too many have been too quiet for too long. And, on this point, we must applaud the efforts of the Occupy Wall Street movement. It took income inequality and corporate responsibility out of the shadows and into the streets.
A report released on Wednesday by the Pew Research Center found that about two-thirds of Americans now perceive a strong conflict between the rich and poor in this country. That was up 19 percentage points from 2009.
As The New York Times pointed out in regard to the report, ''conflict between rich and poor now eclipses racial strain and friction between immigrants and the native-born as the greatest source of tension in American society.''
And this has nothing to do with envy and everything to do with fairness.
Elizabeth Warren, who is now running for the Senate seat that Romney ran for in 1994 and didn't get, probably rebuts this myth of class warfare best by reframing the discussion in terms of a ''social contract'' between the rich and the rest of society. At one of her campaign events, she explained:
''There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody. You built a factory out there, good for you. But, I want to be clear: you moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate. You were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn't have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory and hire someone to protect against this because of the work the rest of us did. Now look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific or a great idea. God bless. Keep a big hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.''
That is the corporate Contract With America: societal symbiosis. We create a society in which smart, hard-working people can be safe and prosper, and they in turn reinvest a fair share of that prosperity back into society for posterity.
Everyone benefits.
But somewhere along the way this got lost. Greed got good. The rich wanted all of the societal benefits and none of the societal responsibilities. They got addicted to seeing profits go up and taxes go down, by any means necessary, no matter the damage to the individual or the collective. Those Maseratis weren't going to pay for themselves.
And the resulting income inequality helped to stall economic mobility.
As The New York Times reported last week, ''many researchers have reached a conclusion that turns conventional wisdom on its head: Americans enjoy less economic mobility than their peers in Canada and much of Western Europe.'' The Times report speculated that: ''One reason for the mobility gap may be the depth of American poverty, which leaves poor children starting especially far behind. Another may be the unusually large premiums that American employers pay for college degrees. Since children generally follow their parents' educational trajectory, that premium increases the importance of family background and stymies people with less schooling.''
Indeed, a November report by the Pew Charitable Trusts' Economic Mobility Project pointed out, ''In the United States, there is a stronger link between parental education and children's economic, educational, and socio-emotional outcomes than in any other country investigated.''
Pew has found that most children raised at the top of the income spectrum stay there and most raised at the bottom stay at the bottom.
An equal opportunity to success is central to this country's optimistic ethos, but income inequality and corporate greed are making a lie of that most basic American truism. The rich and their handmaidens on the political right have consolidated America's wealth on the ever-narrowing peak of a steep hill and greased the slope. And they want to cast everyone at the bottom as lazy or jealous, without acknowledging the accident of birth and collusion of policies that helped grant them their perch.
Income inequality is a threat to this country and the middle class that made her great. If Romney wants to be president, he needs to understand that.
As Alan Krueger, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said on Thursday, ''I think it is clear that we can't go back to the type of policies that exacerbated the rise in inequality and threatened economic mobility in the first place if we want an economy that builds the middle class.''
Not envy Mr. Romney. Opportunity.

HEADLINE: Town, Cast as Romney's Victim, Says, 'Huh?'

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
GAFFNEY, S.C. -- This small Southern town that once boomed with peaches and cotton mills has found itself the unexpected star of the latest bruising fight in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.
It was here in a corner of the state not far from the North Carolina border that Bain Capital, the private equity firm led by Mitt Romney, closed a factory that produced photo scrapbooks. The decision put 150 people out of work. Mr. Romney's company profited.
In a new barrage of political advertisements and speeches here, three of Mr. Romney's opponents in South Carolina's primary on Jan. 21 have used Gaffney and Bain's business practices in other communities across the country as a kind of battering ram to portray him as a job-destroying robber baron.
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas picked up the theme this week, calling Mr. Romney a ''vulture capitalist'' and pointing to Gaffney as an example of the depths to which Mr. Romney will stoop to make a profit. 
There is a problem, though. Here in Gaffney, where deeply held Christian beliefs often matter more than jobs, few remember the Holson Burnes photo album plant, let alone the devastation its closing is alleged to have caused back in 1992.
''I have been here all my life,'' said Ed Elliott, who sells insurance. ''I'm 59 years old, and I've never heard of the plant.''
That Bain's actions carry little resonance in a community whose woes have been seized on by presidential candidates testifies to the impact of the campaigns' opposition research and their willingness to exploit a convenient storyline. Here in Gaffney, the focus is a little embarrassing for residents who do not know what all the fuss is about.
At The Gaffney Ledger, a newspaper established in 1894 that seems to cover everything from stolen mopeds to the Y.M.C.A. basketball league, the publisher, Cody Sossamon, looked through old microfilm to refresh his memory. He could not find one drop of ink that was spent on the factory closing.
''Nobody here really cares about that. It wasn't a big deal,'' Mr. Sossamon said. ''We're looking for a new school superintendent. That and the economy are what people really care about right now.''
Others are similarly mystified.
''I have to be honest with you, and I feel bad saying this, but I had to go look it up when all this started to come out,'' said Kayla Robbs, the executive director of the Cherokee County Chamber of Commerce, which hosted an after-hours business mixer on Thursday.
''Most people around town were a little surprised because it happened so long ago,'' Ms. Robbs said.
That is not to say the loss of any job does not matter here. This city of 12,000 people has been brought to its knees first by the loss of the agricultural sector and then by the slow collapse of the textile industry. Cherokee County, where Gaffney is located, is struggling with a 12 percent unemployment rate.
But there is work to be had. The photo album plant that was abandoned by Bain soon became home to a Bic pen factory that employs 80 people.
Nestle has a large factory here, where a thousand workers make frozen dinners and other packaged food. The Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation, with 500 employees, fashions chassis for school buses and mobile homes. About 700 people work at Timken producing steel roller bearings.
''We're not Appalachia here,'' Mr. Elliott said. ''We're not in poverty.''
Although many mills have closed since the late 1990s, some still churn out fabric. Hamrick Mills turns raw cotton and polyester fiber into pants pockets and blackout curtains. And the company has jobs that can be hard to fill.
Kim Phillips, human resources director, said it sometimes takes 100 interviews to find 10 workers to hire. People either are not qualified or cannot pass drug tests. It is not always marijuana or other street drugs, but drugs that are used without a valid prescription, he said.
Here in a slice of the South so deeply religious that a copy of the Ten Commandments hangs in the local McDonald's, the discussion about the presidential race is as much about preserving a certain culture based on ''family Christian values'' as it is about jobs, Mr. Phillips said.
And that could hurt Mr. Romney more than his opponents' attempts to portray him as a job-killing corporate raider.
''It's the Mormon thing, that and the Northern thing along with the wealth issue,'' said Steve Moss, a retired banker who three years ago became the state representative for the region. Newt Gingrich does not fare much better with many, he said.
Mr. Moss introduced Rick Santorum at a fast-food restaurant in Gaffney on Friday afternoon. Later that evening, Mr. Santorum joined Mr. Gingrich in nearby Duncan for a Republican forum. Mr. Santorum planned to host a town meeting titled ''Faith, Family and Freedom'' on Saturday in Greenville.
Like Ron Paul, Mr. Santorum is not jumping on the Romney-as-corporate raider theme. Other Republicans in South Carolina are pushing back against the attacks, especially after this week's release of several ads based on a 28-minute documentary-style Web video produced by Winning Our Future, a ''super PAC'' that supports Mr. Gingrich.
Called ''Bain: When Romney Came to Town,'' the video laces tearful interviews with workers who lost jobs with images of a smiling Mr. Romney discussing profits and holding dollar bills.
''More ruthless than Wall Street,'' a narrator says.
The attacks could ultimately hurt whichever nominee makes it to the general election, Mr. Moss said.
''The Democrats are just sitting back grinning,'' he said.
In Gaffney, Tom Higgins, 70, who operates a lawn service company with five employees, finds all of it a distraction.
''There's too many other things that concern us,'' he said, noting the loss of jobs to Mexico and Asia.
For years, he was a manager at the Gaffney Manufacturing Company, the biggest fabric mill in town. It moved its operations to Mexico in the late 1990s, leaving him and hundreds of other employees with worthless stock and no jobs.
Before that, his father made a living with peach orchards. Despite the huge Gaffney peach that serves as a water tower tank and is the one of most remarkable landmarks in South Carolina, only one tomato farmer in the county really has a viable agricultural operation left in these gentle hills.
''We've sort of been in a standstill for years, especially since Obama took over,'' Mr. Higgins said.
He said most of the people he knows -- and he seems to know most everyone in town -- had been behind Mr. Perry. But now that support is waning. ''It'll probably be Newt or Mitt,'' he said.
Still, that Gaffney could somehow become a player in a national race strikes him, as it does others here, as surprising. Nobody usually pays much attention to Gaffney, which sits between Spartanburg and Charlotte, N.C.
The last big thing that put Gaffney on the national map was when the Food Network came to town in 2007 and the celebrity chef Guy Fieri ate chili burgers at the Harold's Restaurant downtown.
''I don't think we are special or any different from any other small community in the South and particularly South Carolina,'' said Mayor Henry L. Jolly, one of the few Democrats who holds office here.
The economy is a concern, of course, but so is divisiveness in government and politics, as evidenced by the storm that has seemed to settle this week on his small city.
''This just shows you how badly people can behave,'' Mayor Jolly said.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Vacant businesses in downtown Gaffney, S.C., attest to the decline in textile and agricultural sectors, but the closing of a scrapbook plant in 1992 by Mitt Romney's firm caused scarcely a ripple.
To Tom Higgins, all the political fuss distracts from issues like job losses to other countries.
Mayor Henry L. Jolly said, ''I don't think we are special.''

HEADLINE: Tough Fight Ahead for White Blue-Collar Votes

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Both are Harvard-educated millionaires. Both have been criticized as elitist and technocratic. Both have struggled to handle the populist anger coursing through politics.
In an election climate largely defined by the anxieties of the middle class, working people are now more likely than not to face a choice in November between two candidates who sometimes seem to have trouble relating to them.
One is President Obama, who once characterized them as ''bitter'' people who ''cling to guns or religion.'' The other is Mitt Romney, currently defending himself against accusations from within his own party that he is a ''vulture'' capitalist and who in the past week has suggested that he takes pleasure in firing those who fail to provide good service and that politics might best be practiced by those who have paid off their mortgages. 
This may be a grass-roots year, but neither one of these candidates is mowing his own lawn. And neither one, analysts say, is likely to have an easy time winning the allegiance of a group that is critical to his electoral prospects: white working-class voters.
There is more to the candidacies and backgrounds of the two men, of course, than the shorthand descriptions of their wealth and personalities. Mr. Obama grew up as the son of a single mother and worked as a community organizer in Chicago. Mr. Romney's emphasis on getting tough with China is winning him attention from workers, and former workers, in industries turned upside down by global competition.
But they face substantial challenges based on the perception that they are out of touch with the values and the needs of the kinds of voters who have been most affected by economic and cultural upheaval.
In recent elections, blue-collar white voters have been overwhelmingly in the Republican column. Mr. Obama did much better among them in 2008 than the previous two Democratic presidential candidates had done. But in the 2010 midterm elections, they flocked back to the Republicans.
This time around, they may be swing voters of a sort. This is not because Mr. Obama has a great chance at this point of winning them over again -- polling suggests no big shift so far from 2010 -- but because it will be essential to him to hold down the Republican margin of victory within the group. Equally, it would be vital to Mr. Romney, if he became the nominee, to run up the score.
A study released in November by Ruy Teixeira and John Halpin of the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group, took a comprehensive look at the demographics and geography of the 2012 race. It concluded that Mr. Obama has to repeat his strong 2008 performance among white college graduates if he is to survive a drop in his share of white working-class voters this year to the level the Democratic Party won in 2010.
''Conversely, if Republicans can cut significantly into Obama's white college-graduate support and then replicate the landslide margins they achieved among white working-class voters in 2010,'' the study said, ''then they are likely to emerge victorious.''
If white working-class voters are defined as those of all ages with incomes of $30,000 to $75,000 with no college education, Senator John McCain won 52 percent of them in his 2008 presidential bid, while Mr. Obama won 46 percent, according to national exit polls. It was one of the few groups with which he did well against Mr. Obama, but the result was nonetheless a steep falloff for Republicans from 2004, when President George W. Bush took 67 percent of the same group, and his Democratic rival 32 percent.
But in the Tea Party-fueled backlash election of 2010, white working-class voters went Republican by roughly a 30-point margin.
Even before Mr. Romney emerged as the favorite to win the Republican nomination, a debate was under way over whether Mr. Obama should focus his electoral strategy on friendlier and faster-growing demographic groups, like Hispanics and professionals with high levels of education, and chart an electoral course through states like Colorado and Virginia with large proportions of those types of voters rather than through Rust Belt states heavy with less educated, working-class voters.
But the political landscape seems unusually fluid at the moment, with some evidence that non-college-educated white voters support the goals of the Occupy Wall Street movement, an indication that populist anger over the economy is more free-floating than ideologically fixed.
Now the effort by some of his fellow Republicans to portray Mr. Romney as a job killer during his time at Bain Capital has opened new opportunities for the Obama team among working-class voters, some strategists say.
It is too soon to know how much the development might help Mr. Obama, said Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center, which does extensive public opinion surveys.
''But it at least gives them something to talk about and a place to start,'' Mr. Kohut said, referring to the Obama campaign's opportunity to raise Mr. Romney's record with working-class voters.
The fight for the white working class will revolve around constraints imposed on both sides, said David Saunders, known as Mudcat, a veteran operative who counsels Democrats on appealing to rural and working-class voters.
Mr. Obama will suffer from a steep loss of enthusiasm for him among these voters since the 2008 election, he said. Mr. Romney, a Mormon from a liberal state and with a history of shifting positions, would have trouble invoking the cultural issues that Republicans have always relied on to rally voters, he said.
''The old wedges of God, guns and gays aren't going to work this time around, and that plays obviously to the benefit of Barack Obama,'' Mr. Saunders said.
''There's only one way that Obama can regain momentum among white working-class people, and only one way Mitt Romney can do it, and that's using economic populism,'' he said.
Mr. Saunders said Mr. Romney's call for tougher sanctions on China was particularly resonant among working-class people who have seen jobs devoured by foreign competitors. ''China is the wedge issue that Republicans can use,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Images and Praise Shine a Flattering Light on Romney's Business Past

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
On Friday, Mitt Romney's campaign released a television ad in South Carolina to combat growing attacks on his career as a corporate buyout specialist at Bain Capital. The 30-second spot, titled ''Bright Future,'' is the first Romney campaign ad to address directly his record in the private sector. 
THE SCRIPT ''This is a business Mitt Romney helped start,'' a female narrator says, as the name of the office supply giant Staples flashes on the screen in red letters. ''And this one. And this steel mill,'' the narrator continues, as ''Sports Authority'' and ''Steel Dynamics'' appear, again in red letters. ''Mitt Romney helped create and ran a company that invested in struggling businesses, grew new ones and rebuilt old ones, creating thousands of jobs. Those are the facts.'' It ends with the narrator saying, ''We expected the Obama administration to put free markets on trial, but as The Wall Street Journal said, 'Mr. Romney's G.O.P. opponents are embarrassing themselves by taking the Obama line.' ''
ON THE SCREEN At the beginning of the ad, the names of some companies that Mr. Romney helped start at Bain Capital flash across the gray screen in red letters: Staples, Sports Authority and Steel Dynamics. The ad segues into video of Mr. Romney touring factories. It quotes editorials from two newspapers, The Washington Examiner and The Wall Street Journal, and includes phrases from both: ''Long years of experience creating thousands of jobs,'' reads the quotation from The Examiner, and ''Mr. Romney's G.O.P. opponents ... are embarrassing themselves by taking the Obama line,'' reads the quotation from The Journal. The ad also features video of President Obama, as the words ''Obama: Free markets on trial'' appear over a video of the president speaking.
ACCURACY The ad, which is largely accurate, focuses on a small group of companies that Mr. Romney was successful in starting or turning around. As Mr. Romney himself has said previously, some of the companies Bain Capital took over were not successful, and others did cut jobs first in order to grow. But on the whole, the companies under Mr. Romney and Bain Capital's supervision have created thousands of jobs, including the companies that the ad cites specifically. (It is also worth noting, however, that on the stump, Mr. Romney has recently been claiming that he created over 100,000 jobs, an assertion the ad does not mention and whose overall validity has been questioned.)
SCORECARD In responding to attacks on Mr. Romney's record at Bain Capital, he is focusing only on the positive aspects of corporate restructurings. His advisers have also considered spotlighting the experiences of average workers who benefited from Bain Capital's intervention. While the campaign is responding to an attack, this conversation about Mr. Romney's record as a businessman is one the campaign is willing to have; especially in a socially conservative state like South Carolina, they probably much prefer discussing his record at Bain Capital to defending against attacks on his conservative credentials.

HEADLINE: As Crisis Festers, Pakistani Government Plans Confidence Vote

BYLINE: By DECLAN WALSH; Salman Masood reported from Islamabad, Pakistan, and Alan Cowell from London.

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Threatened with prosecution by a hostile judiciary and fearing an intervention by powerful generals, Pakistan's embattled government turned Friday to its last bastion of strength, the national Parliament, in a bid to stall the momentum of a crisis that threatens to engulf the governing party.
Addressing Parliament, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani announced that he would ask for a vote Monday on a resolution seeking ''full confidence and trust'' in his coalition government. It was his latest gambit in a complex power struggle set off by the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May.
Pakistan's fractious politicians must choose between ''democracy and dictatorship,'' Mr. Gilani said, speaking hours after President Asif Ali Zardari returned from a brief trip to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, that reignited rumors of an impending military coup. 
Pakistani analysts and Western diplomats believe that the prospects of a coup are receding, for now. But the situation remains volatile as the country's most powerful figures -- senior judges, generals and politicians -- engage in a bare-knuckle and unusually public bout of power games in which the United States finds itself sidelined.
At heart, the governing Pakistan Peoples Party and the military, led by Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, are struggling for control of national security policy, including the right to direct the strained relationship with the United States. A strident judiciary and the possibility of elections as early as this summer add complicating factors.
The beginning of the struggle came in the fall, when an American businessman of Pakistani origin, Mansoor Ijaz, made a startling claim: that in the acrid aftermath of the Bin Laden raid on May 2, he had been asked to take a secret letter to the Americans seeking protection for Mr. Zardari's government from a possible military coup. In exchange, it offered to dismantle part of the country's powerful spy agency.
Pakistan's military angrily demanded an investigation into the unsigned memo and embraced Mr. Ijaz's assertion that it had been dictated by Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's ambassador to Washington. Mr. Haqqani, since recalled to Pakistan, has denied that account.
However, the military ignored a later statement by Mr. Ijaz that Lt. Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha, the head of the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, or ISI, visited the Persian Gulf region during the same period to seek support for a coup.
A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court is investigating what the Pakistani news outlets call ''Memogate'' and is scheduled to make its finding by month's end. Meanwhile Mr. Haqqani, who could face treason charges, has confined himself to Mr. Gilani's house in Islamabad, telling reporters that he fears for his life.
The true target of the inquiry may be Mr. Haqqani's boss: Mr. Zardari, leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party. The P.P.P. and the military have a deep mutual mistrust going back three decades. Many generals barely disguise their loathing for the president, who came to power in 2008, in elections after the assassination of his wife, Benazir Bhutto, and who has struggled to shake off a reputation of irredeemable corruption.
For most of 2011, his government sought to ease the tension by defending the embattled generals, particularly against withering domestic criticism after the Bin Laden raid from a public distrustful of the United States and fiercely protective of their nation's sovereignty. But the rising emotions over the Memogate crisis swept any unity away.
In December, Mr. Gilani said he would not tolerate a ''state within a state''; this week he fired the senior bureaucrat in the Defense Ministry, a retired three-star general. That day, the military issued a warning that the government's statements could have ''very serious ramifications with potentially grievous consequences for the country.''
One analyst saw two rationales for the military's furious stance over the memo. First, it could be using the Supreme Court to ''get Zardari out,'' said Najam Sethi, editor of The Friday Times and a senior analyst with Geo, the country's largest television news network. Second, he said, ''Kayani and Pasha have both been considerably weakened by the actions of the Americans.''
''They are having to act extra tough to appease their own ranks,'' Mr. Sethi said.
The conflict shows that the military ''is rigid and uncompromising and not prepared to concede an inch of its turf,'' he added. ''It wants to run foreign policy, it wants to be able to do whatever it wants, and doesn't want any accountability at all.''
In the past, the military has ended frustrations with civilian governments with coups, in 1958, 1969, 1977 and 1999.
This time, analysts say, the military has little incentive for such a move. The economy is in a parlous state, a homegrown Taliban insurgency bubbles in the northwest, and the generals are still smarting from the damage to their reputation from the unpopular nine-year-rule of Pervez Musharraf, which began in the most recent coup and ended in 2008.
In addition, there is unprecedented, real-time scrutiny from a vociferous electronic news media. And the generals can no longer count on the Supreme Court to rubber-stamp a takeover -- although the judiciary led by Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry appears to have its own antipathy for Mr. Zardari and the P.P.P.
As the scandal raged, the court upped the stakes by renewing its order that the government cooperate with a Swiss corruption investigation against Mr. Zardari. The court accused Mr. Gilani of ''willful disobedience'' for not doing so, and gave the government until Monday to comply. Failure could lead to Mr. Gilani's losing his office, it has warned, offering the prospect of a disastrous clash of institutions.
Whether Mr. Chaudhry would risk such a standoff is unclear.
The likelihood of early elections is far greater. As power drains from Mr. Zardari's government, few believe it will last until the Parliament's term ends in February 2013. The question is when the vote would take place, and on whose terms.
The government's objective is to survive until Senate elections, which are to be held before March. Senators are elected by the national and provincial assemblies, and the election will probably give the P.P.P. a majority of seats and control of the upper house for six years.
But a major opposition leader, Nawaz Sharif, favors early general elections -- to avert such a Senate outcome and to stem the threat from a new rival, the former cricket star turned politician Imran Khan. Mr. Khan is a wild card, drawing huge crowds at recent rallies in Lahore and Karachi and threatening Mr. Sharif's base in Punjab Province. Critics accuse him of enjoying the tacit support of the ISI.
''I don't think the army will mount a coup because they don't need one when they have Imran Khan,'' said C. Christine Fair, an assistant professor at Georgetown University.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Renew Myanmar Ties, Citing Reforms

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and SETH MYDANS; Steven Lee Myers reported from Washington and Seth Mydans from Bangkok.

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
WASHINGTON -- The United States moved to restore full diplomatic relations with Myanmar on Friday, rewarding the sweeping political and economic changes that the country's new civilian government has made, including a cease-fire with ethnic rebels and, only hours before, the release of hundreds of political prisoners.
Freeing the prisoners, which President Obama praised as a ''substantial step forward for democratic reform,'' was one of the most significant gestures yet by Myanmar's new civilian government to address international concerns about the country's repressive history, which led to decades of diplomatic and economic isolation.
Among 651 prisoners given amnesty on Friday were leaders of the brutally repressed student protests in 1988; a former prime minister, Khin Nyunt, ousted in an internal purge in 2004; and monks and others involved in antigovernment protests in 2007 that were known as the ''saffron revolution.'' A senior State Department official in Washington described Myanmar's move on Friday as the largest single release of political prisoners in Asia's history. 
The administration's reciprocal announcement is the latest in a series of cautious moves that have significantly eased tensions between the United States and Myanmar, also known as Burma. The diplomatic engagement -- which one senior administration official said would have seemed unthinkable a year ago -- now appears to be accelerating, though he and other officials stopped short of calling it irreversible.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who visited the country for the first time only six weeks ago, said in Washington: ''This is a momentous day for the diverse people of Burma. And we will continue to support them and their efforts and to encourage their government to take bold steps.''
A renewed relationship between the two countries has the potential to remake American diplomacy in Asia, where the Obama administration says it hopes to refocus its foreign policy at a time when China's influence is expanding. The closer ties could enhance trade and help integrate Myanmar into regional alliances sympathetic to the West.
Since taking office last March, the country's president, U Thein Sein, has overseen a raft of changes that appear to indicate a new willingness to end military rule for the first time since a coup in 1962.
He has sought to reform the economy, allow political competition and end the country's economic and diplomatic dependence on China, its huge neighbor to the north. In a move that presages a far broader shift in policies, his government halted work in September on a $3.6 billion dam under construction on the Irrawaddy River by a Chinese state company.
The United States never fully severed relations with Myanmar, as it did over the years with Iran, Cuba and North Korea, but it downgraded relations and withdrew its ambassador after elections in 1990. Those elections were won by the party of the main opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, though never recognized by the military government, which instead cracked down and put her under house arrest. Subsequent administrations have since toughened sanctions on most trade with Myanmar.
The Obama administration is not yet considering lifting sanctions, but Mrs. Clinton announced that it would soon nominate an ambassador and invite Myanmar to send one to Washington. She pledged other actions in response to continued reforms, though she did not spell them out.
Mrs. Clinton, who met with Mr. Thein Sein in the country's newly built capital, Naypyidaw, pressed him to follow through with the nascent reforms, which he appears to be doing. Since her visit, the government scheduled special elections on April 1 to fill 48 vacant parliamentary seats. For the first time since 1990, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and her party will be allowed to seek elected office.
The prisoner release was another critical benchmark that administration officials had tracked closely before announcing Friday's step. Only two months ago, Mr. Thein Sein denied the existence of political prisoners in his country, even though there have been several smaller releases since he took office. Privately, however, he indicated a willingness to release more, though only after a deliberate legal and political process, the officials said.
Even so, the scope of Friday's releases appeared to catch many by surprise. Televised reports from Myanmar showed inmates emerging from the gates of a prison into jubilant crowds of relatives and supporters.
The releases -- described in official reports as an amnesty -- occurred around the country and included political activists, journalists, leaders of ethnic minority groups and relatives of the dictator who led the coup in 1962, Gen. Ne Win.
The exact number of political prisoners in Myanmar remains a matter of dispute, but by some accounts Mr. Thein Sein's government has now released as many as half of 1,000 to 2,000 in custody.
The former prime minister, Mr. Khin Nyunt, had been under house since 2004. Once a senior member of the military junta that overturned the 1990 elections and a head of its dreaded intelligence services, he fell afoul of the government in 2004 after proposing a ''road map to democracy'' and was purged.
''The democratic process is on the right track,'' he said Friday outside his home.
Representative Joseph Crowley, a Democrat from New York City, traveled this week to Myanmar and met with families of political prisoners -- including some released on Friday -- but said there was no advance knowledge of their release.
In a telephone interview from India, he called the exchange of ambassadors ''a measured response'' to what appeared to be genuine changes inside the country. ''If things deteriorate, we have the ability to pull back,'' he said.
He added, though, ''I want to believe this is real.''
The thaw with Myanmar is in some ways a belated success of the Obama administration's early policy to engage with the United States' enemies. The effort has failed with Syria, Iran and North Korea, and for at least for the first two years, Myanmar was no different. That has left many administration officials -- and members of Congress -- wary of moving too quickly.
Mr. Crowley's visit is the first of a flurry of Congressional delegations that have been coordinated with the administration to reinforce the American message -- and maintain support for the diplomatic opening. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and other government opponents in Myanmar have broad, bipartisan support on Capitol Hill.
Myanmar, isolated for so long, is suddenly a diplomatic destination of choice. The British foreign secretary, William Hague, visited last week. France announced that its foreign minister, Alain Juppe, would travel there this weekend.
The Senate's Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, departed for Myanmar on Friday, soon to be followed by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. Mr. McConnell, who annually sponsors legislation sanctioning Myanmar, said in a statement that Mr. Thein Sein's government needed to do more to ensure free elections and disclose its military ties with North Korea.
Even so, he went on, ''It appears entirely appropriate that the United States would consider restoration of more formal diplomatic ties.''
Correction: February 1, 2012, Wednesday
An article on Jan. 14 about American moves to restore full diplomatic relations with Myanmar misstated the circumstances surrounding the departure of the last American ambassador there after the military government refused to recognize an opposition party's victory in the May 1990 election. The ambassador, Burton Levin, retired in September 1990 and was not replaced; he was not withdrawn. The error also appeared in an article on Dec. 3, 2011, about American efforts to promote democracy in Myanmar.

HEADLINE: Things We're Supposed To Be Quiet About

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Of growth and family incomes. 

 BODY:
Apologists for rising inequality often argue that since most Americans' income has risen despite rising inequality, there's no reason to complain about inequality other than envy. So it's worth remembering that we used to expect economic growth to deliver large increases in real income, not just a bit of a rise that's accomplished in large part through longer working hours; and that a major reason so many have seen such small gains is that a large part of growth has been siphoned off to the very high end.
Lane Kenworthy had a nice chart illustrating both points, comparing median family income with real GDP per family (for those worried about the fine points, it was nominal GDP divided by the CPI, avoiding some technical issues):
You see the contrast: a doubling of family incomes in the post war generation compared with maybe 20 percent since, and family incomes growing in line with GDP before, lagging far behind since, with the difference basically being the rising share of the 1 percent.
This is real stuff, not some trivial envy-driven concern. But we must be very, very quiet about it, right?

HEADLINE: It's Still the 'Age of Anxiety.' Or Is It?

BYLINE: DANIEL SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Medieval Europe had barbarian hordes, famine and plague. We have millions of people on Xanax. 

 BODY:
It's hard to believe that anyone but scholars of modern literature or paid critics have read W.H. Auden's dramatic poem "The Age of Anxiety" all the way through, even though it won a Pulitzer Prize in 1948, the year after it was published. It is a difficult work - allusive, allegorical, at times surreal. But more to the point, it's boring. The characters meet, drink, talk and walk around; then they drink, talk and walk around some more. They do this for 138 pages; then they go home.
Auden's title, though: people know. From the moment it appeared, the phrase has been used to characterize the consciousness of our era, the awareness of everything perilous about the modern world: the degradation of the environment, nuclear energy, religious fundamentalism, threats to privacy and the family, drugs, pornography, violence, terrorism. Since 1990, it has appeared in the title or subtitle of at least two dozen books on subjects ranging from science to politics to parenting to sex ("Mindblowing Sex in the Real World: Hot Tips for Doing It in the Age of Anxiety"). As a sticker on the bumper of the Western world, "the age of anxiety" has been ubiquitous for more than six decades now.

But is it accurate? As someone who has struggled with chronic anxiety for many years, I have my doubts. For one thing, when you've endured anxiety's insults for long enough - the gnawed fingernails and sweat-drenched underarms, the hyperventilating and crippling panic attacks - calling the 20th century "The Age of Anxiety" starts to sound like calling the 17th century "The Age of the Throbbing Migraine": so metaphorical as to be meaningless. 
From a sufferer's perspective, anxiety is always and absolutely personal. It is an experience: a coloration in the way one thinks, feels and acts. It is a petty monster able to work such humdrum tricks as paralyzing you over your salad, convincing you that a choice between blue cheese and vinaigrette is as dire as that between life and death. When you are on intimate terms with something so monumentally subjective, it is hard to think in terms of epochs.
And yet it is undeniable that ours is an age in which an enormous and growing number of people suffer from anxiety. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety disorders now affect 18 percent of the adult population of the United States, or about 40 million people. By comparison, mood disorders - depression and bipolar illness, primarily - affect 9.5 percent. That makes anxiety the most common psychiatric complaint by a wide margin, and one for which we are increasingly well-medicated. Last spring, the drug research firm IMS Health released its annual report on pharmaceutical use in the United States. The anti-anxiety drug alprazolam - better known by its brand name, Xanax - was the top psychiatric drug on the list, clocking in at 46.3 million prescriptions in 2010.
Just because our anxiety is heavily diagnosed and medicated, however, doesn't mean that we are more anxious than our forebears. It might simply mean that we are better treated - that we are, as individuals and a culture, more cognizant of the mind's tendency to spin out of control. 
Earlier eras might have been even more jittery than ours. Fourteenth-century Europe, for example, experienced devastating famines, waves of pillaging mercenaries, peasant revolts, religious turmoil and a plague that wiped out as much as half the population in four years. The evidence suggests that all this resulted in mass convulsions of anxiety, a period of psychic torment in which, as one historian has put it, "the more one knew, the less sense the world made." Nor did the monolithic presence of the Church necessarily help; it might even have made things worse. A firm belief in God and heaven was near-universal, but so was a firm belief in their opposites: the Devil and hell. And you could never be certain in which direction you were headed. 
It's hard to imagine that we have it even close to as bad as that. Yet there is an aspect of anxiety that we clearly have more of than ever before: self-awareness. The inhabitants of earlier eras might have been wracked by nerves, but none fixated like we do on the condition. Indeed, none even considered anxiety a condition. Anxiety didn't emerge as a cohesive psychiatric concept until the early 20th century, when Freud highlighted it as "the nodal point at which the most various and important questions converge, a riddle whose solution would be bound to throw a flood of light upon our whole mental existence." 
After that, the number of thinkers and artists who sought to solve this riddle increased exponentially. By 1977, the psychoanalyst Rollo May was noting an explosion in papers, books and studies on the subject. "Anxiety," he wrote, "has certainly come out of the dimness of the professional office into the bright light of the marketplace."
None of this is to say that ours is a serene age. Obviously it isn't. It to say, however, that we shouldn't be possessive about our uncertainties, particularly as one of the dominant features of anxiety is its recursiveness. Anxiety begins with a single worry, and the more you concentrate on that worry, the more powerful it gets, and the more you worry. One of the best things you can do is learn to let go: to disempower the worry altogether. If you start to believe that anxiety is a foregone conclusion - if you start to believe the hype about the times we live in - then you risk surrendering the battle before it's begun.

An opinion essay on Jan. 15 about the prevalence of anxiety disorders erroneously attributed a distinction to the anti-anxiety drug alprazolam, or Xanax. It was the only psychiatric medication among the top 15 - not the top 25 - prescription drugs in the United States in 2010. A summary accompanying the article also referred incorrectly to Xanax. It was prescribed 46.3 million times in the United States in 2010, as the article correctly noted - not to 46 million people.

HEADLINE: Backing of Evangelicals Could Resuscitate Santorum in South Carolina

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: A statement of support from evangelicals could get voters to take another look at Rick Santorum at the expense of other conservatives. 

 BODY:
Polling in the early stages of the nomination race can be extremely fluid, but ordinarily a candidate who is in fourth place with a week to go would have little chance of winning a state primary. This is why the FiveThirtyEight forecast model is skeptical about Rick Santorum's chances of winning South Carolina, where his numbers have slumped since his near-victory in Iowa on Jan 3.
The forecasts, however, are intended to form a benchmark based solely on top-line polling numbers and do not consider other dynamics that may be pertinent.
In the case of South Carolina, those dynamics could be favorable to Mr. Santorum after he received the backing of a significant group of evangelical leaders on Saturday. (According to exit polls, 60 percent of voters in the South Carolina Republican primary identified themselves as born again or evangelical in 2008.) Meanwhile, each of the candidates who is ahead of Mr. Santorum in the polls has vulnerabilities.
Mitt Romney has led all recent South Carolina polls and is the favorite to win there. But, for the first time, he is facing sustained negative attacks from his rivals, who seem to have realized that another win for him would all but cinch the Republican nomination. It is not clear whether the attacks will work -- they could even backfire -- but this introduces a wild card into the race that was not present in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Nor will Mr. Romney necessarily have the benefit of the strong ground game and grass-roots support that helped ensure his victory in New Hampshire. Although he has received the endorsement of South Carolina's governor, Nikki Haley, Ms. Haley's popularity is middling in the state, and Mr. Romney has very few endorsements from rank-and-file Republicans in South Carolina, like those in the state House and Senate.
Through Sept. 30, meanwhile, Mr. Romney had raised only $75,000 in contributions from South Carolina -- barely a third of his fund-raising haul in New Hampshire, even though South Carolina has almost four times as many residents.
The candidate in second place in the South Carolina polls, Newt Gingrich, closed poorly in both Iowa and New Hampshire -- the result of his being especially susceptible to negative attacks, and having a weak field operation that had trouble turning out his vote.
While Mr. Gingrich's campaign has adopted a more aggressive posture in South Carolina, he may continue to be viewed as an attractive target by the other campaigns. The second-place choices of Mr. Gingrich's supporters are about evenly divided between several different candidates, which means that they might each have an incentive to go after him.
Particularly if the dominant storyline in South Carolina is a series of attacks between Mr. Romney, Mr. Gingrich and the "super PACs" that support them, there might be an opportunity for a candidate to rise with a more affirmative message.
Ron Paul, who has the clearest momentum from New Hampshire and who has moved ahead of Mr. Santorum in our South Carolina forecasts, might be one such candidate. So far, Mr. Paul has resisted piling on to Mr. Romney for his tenure at Bain Capital, instead reminding Republican voters of the party's longstanding commitment to free-market ideals.
However, the South has not traditionally been receptive to libertarian politics. Instead, voters in the region are strong social conservatives, and are relatively hawkish in their foreign policy views, while sometimes having ambivalent feelings about economic policy and supporting some elements of the welfare state.
Mr. Paul's message is more flexible than you might think: it has taken on populist undertones at times, as when he has critiqued what he calls "'crony capitalism." Nevertheless, the recent Public Policy Polling survey of South Carolina found that his favorability rating was just 38 percent there, and he would need to win the large majority of those voters to win the state.
That leaves Mr. Santorum. His favorability rating, 53 percent, was considerably better than Mr. Paul's in the Public Policy Polling survey, and his 30 percent unfavorable rating was the lowest of any Republican candidate in the state. Like Mr. Paul, Mr. Santorum has avoided attacking Mr. Romney about Bain Capital, trying to maintain his positive image.
As The Atlantic's Molly Ball notes, there is a parallel between the endorsement Mr. Santorum received on Saturday and the backing he received from influential conservatives like Bob Vander Plaats in the days leading up to Iowa. Those endorsements helped to break a logjam between Mr. Santorum and other conservative candidates as voters behaved tactically and jumped on his bandwagon.
The extent to which there is a consensus of voters who want to defeat Mr. Romney in South Carolina is unclear. In the Public Policy Polling survey, 58 percent of voters said they would prefer another candidate to Mr. Romney. Nevertheless, Mr. Romney led hypothetical one-on-one matchups against several Republican opponents in the poll, including against Mr. Santorum, and Mr. Romney's favorability ratings were reasonably strong.
The scenario in which Mr. Santorum would actually win South Carolina, therefore, probably requires two things. First, Saturday's statement would have to get voters to take another look at him at the expense of other conservatives like Mr. Gingrich or Mr. Perry. And second, the negative attacks by Mr. Gingrich would have to succeed in softening up Mr. Romney's support, but not play to Mr. Gingrich's direct benefit either, allowing Mr. Santorum to leapfrog both and win with perhaps 25 percent of the vote.

HEADLINE: What's Race Got to Do With It?

BYLINE: LEE SIEGEL


HIGHLIGHT: There has yet to be any discussion over the one quality that has subtly driven Mitt Romney's candidacy: his race. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney may not have officially clinched the Republican nomination, but his victory has never really been in doubt. Nor has his viability in November: the most fanatical Tea Partiers are not about to withhold their votes and risk allowing President Obama to be re-elected.
Pundits have already begun the endless debate over whether Mr. Romney's wealth and religion are hindrances or assets. But there has yet to be any discussion over the one quality that has subtly fueled his candidacy thus far and could well put him over the top in the fall: his race. The simple, impolitely stated fact is that Mitt Romney is the whitest white man to run for president in recent memory.
Of course, I'm not talking about a strict count of melanin density. I'm referring to the countless subtle and not-so-subtle ways he telegraphs to a certain type of voter that he is the cultural alternative to America's first black president. It is a whiteness grounded in a retro vision of the country, one of white picket fences and stay-at-home moms and fathers unashamed of working hard for corporate America.
In this way, Mr. Romney's Mormonism may end up being a critical advantage. Evangelicals might wring their hands over the prospect of a Mormon president, but there is no stronger bastion of pre-civil-rights-America whiteness than the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Yes, since 1978 the church has allowed blacks to become priests. But Mormonism is still imagined by its adherents as a religion founded by whites, for whites, rooted in a millenarian vision of an America destined to fulfill a white God's plans for earth.
It's true that Mr. Romney's opponents are all white as well. But each is tainted in his own way. Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich appear soft on Hispanic immigration, and Mr. Gingrich is hardly the standard-bearer for the invincible nuclear family.
Rick Santorum is an Italian-American Catholic, while Jon Huntsman, though a Mormon himself, wears his cosmopolitanism too brazenly. (Does he really think it's an asset, in the eyes of a Republican primary voter, to speak Mandarin?) And Ron Paul's isolationist conspiracy-mongering recalls, if anything, the radical-right fringe of the '50s and '60s, of the John Birchers and the followers of George Wallace, a manic moment even most evangelicals would rather forget.
Contrast that with Mr. Romney's meticulously cultivated whiteness. He is nearly always in immaculate white shirt sleeves. He is implacably polite, tossing off phrases like "oh gosh" with Stepford bonhomie. He has mastered Benjamin Franklin's honesty as the "best policy": a practiced insincerity, an instant sunniness that, though evidently inauthentic, provides a bland bass note that keeps everyone calm. This is the bygone world of Babbitt, of small-town Rotarians.
Mr. Romney does not merely use the past as an inspirational reference point, as the other candidates often do. He conjures it as a total social, cultural and political experience that must be resurrected and reinhabited. He speaks of the founding fathers and the Declaration of Independence as phases of national creativity that we are destined to live through again. He frequently accompanies his recitative with verses from "America the Beautiful."
And while Mr. Romney may, in some people's eyes, be a non-Christian, he is better than any of his opponents at synching his worldview with that of the evangelicals. He likes to present, with theological urgency, a stark choice between, in his words, President Obama's "entitlement society" and the true American freedom of an "opportunity society." By the time he intones the Puritans' alabaster ideal of America as a "shining city on a hill," you wonder if he is not also asking us to choose between two different types of mountaintops.
In this way, whether he means to or not, Mr. Romney connects with a central evangelic fantasy: that the Barack Obama years, far from being the way forward, are in fact a historical aberration, a tear in the white space-time continuum. And let's be clear: Mr. Obama's election was not destiny, but a fluke.
Despite a general revulsion against George W. Bush and his policies, despite John McCain's lack of ideas and his remoteness from contemporary American problems, the Republican ticket was ahead of Mr. Obama by several points in September 2008. Then came the fall: Lehman Brothers, the stock-market plunge and skyrocketing unemployment (not to mention Sarah Palin).
By the iron law of elections, the country threw the bums out and rejected anyone even remotely tied to them. The result? America's first black president.
And yet, as became immediately apparent in 2009, millions of Americans were unwilling to accept the basic democratic premise that Mr. Obama legally and morally deserved to sit in the White House - and that was before they confronted his "socialist" and "un-American" policy agenda.
Mitt Romney knows this. He knows that he offers to these people the white solution to the problem of a black president. I am sure that Mr. Romney is not a racist. But I am also sure that, for the many Americans who find the thought of a black president unbearable, he is an ideal candidate. For these sudden outsiders, Mitt Romney is the conventional man with the outsider faith - an apocalyptic pragmatist - who will wrest the country back from the unconventional man with the intolerable outsider color.

HEADLINE: In Defense of Europe

BYLINE: NICHOLAS KRISTOF


HIGHLIGHT: Readers comment on my Sunday column defending Europe from the Republican insinuations that it's a socialist failure. 

 BODY:
My Sunday column looks at the torrent of Republican accusations that President Obama is trying to the turn the U.S. into Europe. And basically I argue that that wouldn't be the worst fate.
Look, Europe has real problems. It's in an economic crisis, and it has long-term budget problems and an over-rigid labor market that raises unemployment rates. But it also has much greater vitality than most Americans realize, and the caricature that many Americans have in their minds is just that, a caricature. On some big issues, including education, health and climate change, Europe does better than America. That's my take, anyway. What's yours? And I'd particular welcome thoughts from people living in Europe.

HEADLINE: Among Small-Business Advocates, Reaction to President's Plan Is Mixed

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The proposed reorganization would bring cabinet-level status for the S.B.A. but also concerns that the agency's authority would be diluted. 

 BODY:
Advocates for small business - including those in Congress - had near uniformly mixed reactions to President Obama's proposal Friday to temporarily elevate the Small Business Administration to a cabinet agency but then fold the S.B.A. into a super trade and commerce department. Uniformly mixed in that most people The Agenda contacted praised the decision to make the S.B.A. part of the cabinet but expressed caution about the consolidation proposal.
The president called for merging the S.B.A. with the Commerce Department and four trade-related agencies into, as the president put it in a speech on Friday, "one department, with one Web site, one phone number, one mission: helping American businesses succeed." In a conference call with reporters, Jeff Zients, deputy director for management at the Office of Management and Budget, said the prospective new department would comprise four broad "pillars." Small business and economic development would be one of those pillars, and the S.B.A would be combined with economic development programs at other agencies into one of those mission areas. (The other pillars would be trade, technology and innovation, and statistics.) 
As for concerns that the new agency might dilute the S.B.A.'s authority to speak for small business inside the government, Mr. Zients seemed to suggest that all American businesses might have to ally in a global economy. "This integrated department will be about serving America's businesses - small, medium and large - as they compete in the global marketplace," he said.
Once the agencies are merged, Mr. Zients added, the S.B.A. would lose its seat at the president's table. "Once we have consolidation authority, once this specific proposal passes," he said, "we will have one integrated department that is led by a secretary who will be on top of all of the important assets and services that serve businesses." The United States trade representative, whose office would be merged into the new department, would retain a separate cabinet position.
Leaders of the small-business committees in Congress said in separate statements that while they supported streamlining government, they would review the president's plans carefully. "The details will be critical," said Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, the top Republican on the Senate Small Business Committee. "Of particular concern will be ensuring that entrepreneurs do not face new hurdles in obtaining assistance in starting, operating or expanding their small businesses - whether accessing capital, pursuing exporting opportunities, or contracting with the federal government."
Outside Congress, most small-business advocates treaded with similar care. "On the one hand, reorganizing federal agencies to create a 'one-stop-shop' for America's small businesses could streamline processes and make accessing information and assistance much easier," Todd McCracken, chief executive of the National Small Business Association, said in a statement. "On the other hand, such a reorganization could minimize the emphasis placed on small business by the federal government and lead to an even greater imbalance toward promoting the interests of large businesses over those of small business."
John Arensmeyer, chief executive of the Small Business Majority, a group initially formed to back the administration's health care reform, said: "Right now small business has an independent agency that reflects its needs. The obvious concern is that by bringing this into larger agency there's a risk that some of that voice gets lost. We know that government is held in very low esteem by small business, but the S.B.A. is an exception to that right now."
There were some stronger views. For example, the American Small Business League, which protests the diversion of federal contracts for small business to large corporations, sided firmly with the other hand. "This is not a move to save money," said the league's president, Lloyd Chapman, in a statement. "This is a move to eliminate federal small-business contracting programs."
But the head of one trade association for S.B.A.-backed lenders was optimistic. "The lending policies and centralized loan operations of S.B.A. are among the more sophisticated in the federal government," said Chris Crawford, president of the National Association of Development Companies, which represents lenders in the S.B.A.'s 504 loan program. In a reorganization, "they become the model for the collapse of the far-flung bureaucracies into one unit called small-business lending - worldwide. If anything, even in a larger reconstituted Commerce Department, access to credit for small businesses becomes a primary mission goal with much higher visibility."
But opposition from the small-business constituency and its Congressional representatives, should it materialize, is only one obstacle for the administration to overcome - many interests, and Congressional fiefdoms, are at stake. Just a few hours after the president spoke, Sen. Max Baucus, the Democratic chair of the Finance Committee, and Dave Camp, the Republican chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, jointly rejected any effort to relocate the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, an agency under their purview: "Making it just another corner of a new bureaucratic behemoth would hurt American exports and hinder American job creation."
And if the consolidation were to fail, those small-business advocates just might get the best of both worlds: an independent S.B.A. but with cabinet-level status.

HEADLINE: Israeli Women Core of Debate On Orthodoxy

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER and ISABEL KERSHNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- In the three months since the Israeli Health Ministry awarded a prize to a pediatrics professor for her book on hereditary diseases common to Jews, her experience at the awards ceremony has become a rallying cry.
The professor, Channa Maayan, knew that the acting health minister, who is ultra-Orthodox, and other religious people would be in attendance. So she wore a long-sleeve top and a long skirt. But that was hardly enough.
Not only did Dr. Maayan and her husband have to sit separately, as men and women were segregated at the event, but she was instructed that a male colleague would have to accept the award for her because women were not permitted on stage.
Though shocked that this was happening at a government ceremony, Dr. Maayan bit her tongue. But others have not, and her story is entering the pantheon of secular anger building as a battle rages in Israel for control of the public space between the strictly religious and everyone else. 
At a time when there is no progress on the Palestinian dispute, Israelis are turning inward and discovering that an issue they had neglected -- the place of the ultra-Orthodox Jews -- has erupted into a crisis.
And it is centered on women.
''Just as secular nationalism and socialism posed challenges to the religious establishment a century ago, today the issue is feminism,'' said Moshe Halbertal, a professor of Jewish philosophy at Hebrew University. ''This is an immense ideological and moral challenge that touches at the core of life, and just as it is affecting the Islamic world, it is the main issue that the rabbis are losing sleep over.''
The list of controversies grows weekly: Organizers of a conference last week on women's health and Jewish law barred women from speaking from the podium, leading at least eight speakers to cancel; ultra-Orthodox men spit on an 8-year-old girl whom they deemed immodestly dressed; the chief rabbi of the air force resigned his post because the army declined to excuse ultra-Orthodox soldiers from attending events where female singers perform; protesters depicted the Jerusalem police commander as Hitler on posters because he instructed public bus lines with mixed-sex seating to drive through ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods; vandals blacked out women's faces on Jerusalem billboards.
Public discourse in Israel is suddenly dominated by a new, high-toned Hebrew phrase, ''hadarat nashim,'' or the exclusion of women. The term is everywhere in recent weeks, rather like the way the phrase ''male chauvinism'' emerged decades ago in the United States.
All of this seems anomalous to most people in a country where five young women just graduated from the air force's prestigious pilots course and a woman presides over the Supreme Court.
But each side in this dispute is waging a vigorous public campaign.
The New Israel Fund, which advocates for equality and democracy, organized singalongs and concerts featuring women in Jerusalem and put up posters of women's faces under the slogan, ''Women should be seen and heard.'' The Israel Medical Association asserted last week that its members should boycott events that exclude women from speaking on stages.
Religious authorities said liberal groups were waging a war of hatred against a pious sector that wanted only to be left in peace.
That sector, the black-clad ultra-Orthodox, is known in Israel as Haredim, meaning those who tremble before God. It comprises many groups with distinct approaches to liturgy as well as to coat length, hat style, beard and side locks and different hair coverings for women. Among them are the Hasidim of European origin as well as those from Middle Eastern countries who are represented by the political party Shas.
As a group, the ultra-Orthodox are, at best, ambivalent about the Israeli state, which they consider insufficiently religious and premature in its founding because the Messiah has not yet arrived. Over the decades the Haredim angrily demonstrated against state practices like allowing buses to run on the Sabbath, and most believed the state would not survive.
The feeling was mutual. The original Haredi communities in Europe were decimated in the Holocaust, and when Israel's founding prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, offered subsidies and army exemptions to the few in Israel then, he thought he was providing the group with a dignified funeral.
''Most Israelis at the time assumed the Haredim would die off in one generation,'' said Jonathan Rosenblum, a Haredi writer.
Instead, they have multiplied, joined government coalitions and won subsidies and exemptions for children, housing and Torah study. They now number a million, a mostly poor community in an otherwise fairly well-off country of 7.8 million.
They have generally stayed out of the normal Israeli politics of war and peace, often staying neutral on the Palestinian question and focusing their deal-making on the material and spiritual needs of their constituents. Politically they have edged rightward in recent years.
In other words, while rejecting the state, the ultra-Orthodox have survived by making deals with it. And while dismissing the group, successive governments -- whether run by the left or the right -- have survived by trading subsidies for its votes. Now each has to live with the other, and the resulting friction is hard to contain.
''The coexistence between the two is breaking down,'' said Arye Carmon, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem research organization. ''It is an extreme danger.''
Mr. Carmon compared the strictly religious Jews of Israel to the Islamists in the Arab world, saying that there was a similar dynamic at play in Egypt, with tensions growing between the secular forces that led the revolution and the Islamic parties now rising to prominence.
''Today there is not a city without a Haredi community,'' said Rabbi Abraham Israel Gellis, a 10th-generation Jerusalem Haredi rabbi, as he sat in his home, an enormous yeshiva on a hill outside his window. ''I have 38 grandchildren and they live all over the country.''
But while the community has gained increased economic might -- there is a growing market catering to its needs -- what is lacking is economic productivity. The community places Torah study above all other values and has worked assiduously to make it possible for its men to do that rather than work. While the women often work, there is a 60 percent unemployment rate among the men, who also generally do not serve in the army.
It is this combination -- accepting government subsidies, refusing military service and declining to work, all while having six to eight children per family -- that is unsettling for many Israelis, especially when citizens feel economically insecure and mistreated by the government.
''The Haredi issue is a force flowing underground, like lava, and it could explode,'' Shelly Yacimovich, a member of the Israeli Parliament, and leader of the Labor Party, said in an interview. ''That's why it must be dealt with wisely, helping them to join modern society through work.''
While change has begun -- thousands of Haredi men are learning professions, more are getting jobs and a small number have joined the Israeli Army -- the community is in crisis. Many ultra-Orthodox leaders feel threatened by the integration into the broader society by some of their followers, and they are desperately holding on to their power.
''We have to earn a living,'' said Rabbi Shmuel Pappenheim, a reformist Haredi leader from the town of Beit Shemesh. ''We are a million people with a million problems. The rabbis can shout a thousand times against it but it won't help them. And so we have the extremism -- on both sides.''
Dan Ben-David, executive director of the Taub Center for Social Policy Studies in Israel, said fertility rates in the Haredi community made the issue especially acute; the very religious Jews are the only group in Israel having more children today than 30 years ago.
''They make up more than 20 percent of all kids in primary schools,'' he said. ''In 20 years, there is a risk we will have a third-world population here which can't sustain a first-world economy and army.''
And, Mr. Ben-David added, what children learn in the ultra-Orthodox school system -- largely unregulated by the state as a result of political deals -- is unsuited for the 21st century, so even those who wish to work are finding it hard to find jobs.
''Their schools do not give them the skills to work in a modern economy and no training in civil or human rights or democracy,'' Mr. Ben-David said. ''They don't even know what we are talking about -- what we want from them -- when we talk about discrimination against women.''
The Haredi community thinks this is a wild misunderstanding of its views.
Rabbi Dror Moshe Cassouto, a 33-year-old Hasid, lives with his wife and four sons in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Mea Shearim, one of the centers of Haredi life in Israel. He never looks directly at a woman, other than his wife, and he believes that men and women have roles in nature that in modern society have been reversed, ''because we live in darkness.''
His goal is to spread the light. ''God watches over the Jewish nation as long as it studies Torah,'' he said.
Still, the spitting and Nazi talk horrify him. He says hard-liners have caused harm to the Haredim.
Asked about the recent troubles, Rabbi Cassouto shook his head and said, ''A fool throws a stone into a well and 1,000 sages can't remove it.''

HEADLINE: What Happened to Baby Annie?

BYLINE: By JEFFREY E. SINGER and COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
THE lives of Li Hangbin and Li Ying were intertwined nearly from the start.
Although unrelated by blood, they shared a common Chinese surname, and as third-grade classmates, they shared the same double desk in their hometown, Changle, in the Fujian province of China.
After the two left school, in 2004, each of their families paid Chinese ''snakehead'' immigrant smugglers upward of $60,000 to sneak them into the United States through separate but similarly arduous and circuitous journeys, they said.
Once in New York, they both took low-paying jobs, became a couple and moved into a boarding house in Flushing, Queens. In August 2007, they became parents of a baby girl they called Annie.
For almost four years, they have both been inmates on Rikers Island, charged with the shaken baby death of 70-day-old Annie, for which they will be tried -- together -- in a Queens courtroom, most likely this spring. 
According to the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, the father, Li Hangbin, 27, inflicted horrific injuries on Annie on Oct. 22, 2007, and then, along with Ms. Li, 26, neglected to call 911 until after midnight, which might have cost the baby her life.
Five days after Annie was taken to the emergency room, she died. After investigating for nearly five months, the police arrested the couple, who at the time spoke almost no English, and charged them with second-degree manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a child. Mr. Li also faces second-degree murder, and if convicted, could serve 25 years to life. Ms. Li's charges carry a maximum sentence of 15 years.
Despite the disturbing charges, a group of supporters has sprung up over the past year in the Chinese community in Flushing, arguing that the Lis, far from being the monsters portrayed by the district attorney's office, are themselves victims, whose poverty, lack of connections and unfamiliarity with the American justice system made them vulnerable targets for prosecutors.
They cite the fact that the couple have no criminal records, and no history of domestic problems.
''The couple has been swallowed up by the system,'' said Michael Chu, a Flushing travel agent and local advocate who had never heard of the Lis until a client mentioned the case two years ago.
Mr. Chu's third-floor travel office, just off Main Street in a neighborhood that teems with Chinese immigrants, has become headquarters for what a banner on the wall proclaims in Chinese as the ''Li Ying, Li Hangbin Rescue Committee.''
On the walls, listings of resort bargains and flight deals have been replaced by petitions and clippings from Chinese-language newspapers about the Li case. There is even an elaborate diagram of a family tree that outlines both parents' family history -- including births, deaths and medical records -- going back four generations. Mr. Chu said he had gathered ''substantial evidence to suggest that there are genetic defects that run in the family line'' that might have led to the early deaths of six direct relatives, including three newborns who died at roughly 2 months old.
The family tree was suggested by Mr. Chu's wife. A local practitioner of Chinese medicine was buying a plane ticket in Mr. Chu's office last year when he noticed that the diagram suggested that a condition called osteogenesis imperfecta, which can cause weak bones, might run in the family and could have contributed to Annie's death. Mr. Chu has recruited other clients to help him research medical and legal defense strategies, not to mention raise money to pay for the couple's defense.
The portraits of the Lis drawn by the two opposing sides could not be more different. Legal authorities say they are abusive parents who callously let their daughter languished near death for hours rather than call 911. Supporters say the Lis are struggling immigrants who loved their child and have gotten caught up in legal machinery that they don't understand and are ill prepared to confront.
The stark disagreement extends even to what happened to Annie's body after her death. The Lis say the police at the 109th Precinct station ignored their repeated requests to retake custody of the body. Officials from the Queens district attorney's office say Annie was never claimed by the Lis from the morgue, despite repeated notices from the authorities. Whichever is true, Annie's body lingered in the morgue for six months before she was buried, without a funeral, in a small pine box in a mass grave on Hart Island.
RIKERS ISLAND, with its 11,000 inmates, is primarily intended for short stays, housing defendants awaiting trial or those sentenced to a year or less in a city jail. Jail officials say the average stay for an inmate awaiting trial is 54.6 days, and for a city-sentenced inmate, approximately 36 days.
A murder case often takes a year or two to go to trial, but rarely longer.
On a recent weekday, Ms. Li sat in a Rikers visiting room, speaking softly in Mandarin. She and Mr. Li have been there since shortly after their arrests, separated from the guards and other inmates by language and culture, and unable to make the $250,000 bail set for each. On this and other visits, she and Mr. Li told their story in separate interviews.
After arriving in the United States in 2004, Ms. Li applied for, and received, a green card. Mr. Li started the process to get a green card, and both worked to pay off their immigration debts, holding several low-paying restaurant jobs.
In March 2007, they arrived at the three-story apartment building on Union Street in Flushing that serves as a boarding house for Chinese immigrants. Ms. Li was pregnant with Annie, and they moved into a two-bedroom apartment with Zhou Meizhen, 59, a mother of three, who ran the house.
In August, Annie was born at a hospital. The couple paid for the birth out of pocket because they did not have health insurance, they said. The Lis relied on their ''Aunt'' Zhou for parenting advice, and she was, in fact, home with the couple on the night of the baby's collapse. In interviews, Ms. Zhou said the Lis were devoted and careful parents.
''They never even had a fight,'' she said. ''They were good people. They were happy and always smiling.'' She said she heard no crying or commotion in the days and hours leading up to Annie's collapse.
Around midnight on the evening of Oct. 22, Mr. Li said, he was bottle-feeding Annie when she suddenly began spitting up. Then she lost consciousness. Mr. Li said he tried to revive her with chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Ms. Li woke up Ms. Zhou, who called 911 immediately, Mr. Li said. The baby was taken by ambulance to Flushing Hospital Medical Center, where she was revived and put on life support, but with severe brain damage. Mr. Li said he first sensed that there was a legal problem when a hospital staff member told him that donating Annie's organs could reduce the charges.
''What charges?'' Mr. Li said he remembered thinking.
''I would never do anything to cause her harm,'' he said in an interview at Rikers.
While Annie remained brain dead and on life support, the police repeatedly brought the Lis in for questioning. Interpreters were used during the interrogation, but the couple did not have lawyers. Both parents resolutely denied harming the child. They said detectives kept them hungry and held them in cold cells, often for hours, before interrogating them for many more. The detectives used a line of questioning that presumed their guilt, the Lis said, and promised them they could return to their dying child if they admitted complicity in the baby's injury.
They did not admit wrongdoing. But investigators said Mr. Li described accidentally bumping Annie's head against a small night table just before the 911 call, a seemingly slight accident that, according to the criminal complaint, ''is inconsistent with the nature and severity of the complainant's injuries.''
Mr. Li said that detectives were pressing him to come up with a reason for the baby's head injuries, and that he finally offered that it was possible that, in all the chaos, her head might have hit the night stand. The admission contributed to his being charged with more serious crimes than his wife.
He declared his innocence, saying, ''I would never allow any harm to come to my baby.''
Annie died on Oct. 28, five days after she arrived at the emergency room.
After the couple's arrest, the lawyers assigned to them requested a suicide watch for the couple, and Ms. Li was put in Elmhurst Hospital Center's psychiatric unit, where she spent several days in restraints, she said, before being taken to Rikers. She was pregnant at the time with the couple's second child.
For the birth, on Oct. 30, 2008, she was taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center shackled at the hands and feet throughout most of her stay, she said. She gave birth to a daughter, Nianni, whose name means ''Remember Annie'' in Chinese.
THE Lis' trial delays are largely the result of language differences, their changing representation and extensive court hearings, including 18 months of intermittent hearings on whether they had been correctly apprised of their rights and completely understood what was going on during their interrogations. A judge ultimately ruled that the interrogations had been conducted properly.
According to the charges, Annie's injuries included a massive skull fracture from two ''non-accidental'' blows that caused brain damage, hemorrhaging and eye injuries, as well as two broken legs and a fractured rib that had not fully healed. The death was described in the criminal complaint as ''homicide by shaking and blunt impact of the head.''
The complaint goes on to state that Annie's injuries were ''consistent with the non-accidental inflicted trauma of shaken-baby syndrome, which occurs when a baby is repeatedly and violently shaken, causing brain damage.''
The complaint also says the Lis may have cost Annie her life by allowing her to languish for hours with injuries while they sought advice, calling their parents in China instead of immediately calling 911. The Lis say they did call their parents earlier in the evening, hours before they recognized any problems with their child. According to the complaint, a friend told investigators he arrived at the Lis' home around 8 p.m. and remained until the ambulance came later that night. He said that Annie was not crying and did not show any signs of injury, but that she did seem sick, especially after midnight, and was making gurgling sounds and ''sweating and not moving her legs.'' The man has since disappeared.
Kevin Ryan, a spokesman for the Queens district attorney's office, would not comment on the case. A law enforcement source familiar with the case who was not authorized to speak and, thus, would comment only anonymously, said the Lis had taken Annie to Flushing Hospital Medical Center as a ''horrifically battered baby.''
''Even the most vociferous critics of shaken-baby syndrome would look at this case and say, 'This is a battered child,' '' the source added. ''The skull was basically broken in half, and in such a small baby, it was just horrific.''
At a training conference in September on shaken-baby syndrome for medical and legal professionals, Mr. Brown, the Queens district attorney, cited a then-pending article in Pediatrics magazine about a study indicating that the incidence of abusive head trauma to American children under age 5 had increased drastically over the past few years of the recession, ''suggesting that economic woes may have led parents to lash out against their kids.''
For the Lis' supporters, the case is not nearly so clear-cut. Mr. Chu points to the other possible causes of Annie's death, though he's no expert. In an unforeseen consequence, the long delay in bringing the Lis to trial has provided him with time to raise money and awareness of their cause in New York's Chinese immigrant community. One man serving a prison sentence upstate sent a $30 check.
At a demonstration last month on Main Street, passers-by put more than $500 into a donation box, next to which Nianni, who is in the care of Ms. Zhou, stood holding a sign that read in Chinese, ''Save my mother and father!''
''They say that the U.S. is a country of human rights,'' Ms. Zhou said in an interview on another afternoon. ''Is this fair? Is this just? How many years of their lives do they have left to waste?''
Mr. Chu said he hoped that lawyers could cast doubt on the prosecutors' claim that the severe fractures were caused by shaking or flinging, since the autopsy showed no fractures to Annie's spinal cord and neck. He and other supporters say that if the Lis did delay calling 911, it was not because of any disregard for the baby's condition, but because they, like many new Chinese immigrants, feared government officials and the authorities in general, even in emergencies. Immediately after the Lis' arrest, nearly all the tenants in their apartment building in Flushing moved out, fearing repercussions from immigration authorities, Ms. Zhou said.
Last year, Mr. Chu hired Cedric Ashley, a private lawyer, to replace the public defender who had been representing Mr. Li. Mr. Ashley, who has defended others accused in shaken-baby cases, hopes to exploit the growing criticism of the whole idea of shaken-baby syndrome, which has come under re-examination in legal and medical circles as convictions have been overturned and appealed.
Mr. Ashley and Murray Singer, Ms. Li's court-appointed lawyer, said prosecutors, lacking strong witnesses and a direct confession, would most likely make their case in court by calling on medical experts to interpret Annie's grisly autopsy. Mr. Ashley said the autopsy ''will be very helpful to the Lis,'' because it shows the baby's neck was undamaged, an issue in shaken-baby cases. The defense will call its own experts as rebuttal witnesses, making for a trial that Mr. Ashley thinks will be ''a battle of experts.''
In the past year, prosecutors have several times offered Ms. Li a chance to go free, provided that she plead guilty in open court. She has refused, she said in an interview, because ''I did not do anything wrong.'' A false admission of guilt, she said, would send the wrong message to her surviving daughter and dishonor the memory of her dead daughter.
ON a recent Saturday, as she does several times a month, Ms. Zhou took Nianni to visit her mother on Rikers Island.
It is a half-day routine that the girl goes through almost automatically: riding the city bus over the narrow bridge onto the island, standing in the long lines for repeated security checks and searches. As soon as the heavy automatic door to the visiting room slid open, Nianni dashed in past a guard and spied her mother across a room filled with dozens of inmates and visitors.
Ms. Li was the only Asian inmate there. She sat in a plastic chair, at a square table, looking small in her jail-issued jumpsuit. When she spotted Nianni, she smiled, and Nianni ran into her open arms.
Nianni explored coloring books and puzzles in the play area and returned frequently to hug her mother, who seemed subdued, her hands in her lap, her fine black hair pulled back into a ponytail. Ms. Li punctuated her comments with frequent sobs, which she tried to hide from Nianni.
At one point, Nianni walked over and said in Mandarin, ''You're crying.'' She hugged her mother.
Ms. Li held her daughter and fought back tears.
''Now, for my second daughter,'' she said, ''I try to control my crying.''

HEADLINE: Shopping for the Best Rates

BYLINE: By VICKIE ELMER

 BODY:
THE lowest interest rates in decades sound enticing enough, but they are often out of borrowers' reach.
Mortgage lenders adjust their rates based on perceptions of risk, so unless you can show you're a low-risk borrower, you are unlikely to qualify for a rate that matches those seen in all the advertisements or headlines.
The rates quoted by Freddie Mac and others are averages drawn from a variety of financial institutions, and lenders use varied approaches to set them. As its base line, for instance, the Brooklyn Cooperative Federal Credit Union uses rates posted on the Credit Union National Association Web site for New York, according to Daniel Alejandro Gonzalez, the credit union's director of lending. Others, like Chase Mortgage, use markers like Treasury yields and agency mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae. 
Consumers who want to try for the lowest rates available need to consider these basic factors.
CREDIT SCORE The ideal borrower has a FICO score of 740 or higher, said Thasunda Brown Duckett, the senior vice president of Chase Mortgage's East Region. ''That puts you in the best place for pricing,'' said Ms. Duckett, whose office is based in Manhattan. According to MyFICO.com, borrowers in New York with scores of 760 to 850 could qualify for an annual percentage rate of 3.95 percent on a $500,000 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, while those with scores of 620 to 639 qualify for 5.53 percent.
POINTS The lowest rates usually are decreased by paying a fee called a point, or 1 percent of the loan amount. ''You need to buy points in order to get the best rates at many banks,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. In Freddie Mac's weekly survey on mortgage rates, points have averaged 0.7 percent on loans in the last year. Points might make sense depending on your financial situation and how long you expect to stay in a home. So ask for a zero point quote, too, and compare.
PROPERTY TYPES If you're buying a duplex or a four-unit building, your rate will almost certainly be higher. Condominiums may also have a rate premium, especially if they are newer or your down payment is below 25 percent. Lenders charge more if you are not planning to live in the home. Commercial properties like apartment buildings have the highest rates, as they are considered riskier, Mr. Gonzalez said.
DOWN PAYMENT Ms. Duckett says that borrowers who put down at least 25 percent are more likely to obtain ''attractive pricing'' at Chase. Lenders offer different breaks on rates if equity is higher, so you should ask what is available.
LOAN LENGTH A lot depends on how long you plan to live in a home. If you're likely to move in a few years, an adjustable-rate loan with a low interest rate fixed for, say, three to five years, and adjusted afterward, might work best. Also, rates on 15-year fixed-rate loans are lower than those on the 30-year -- 0.77 percentage points, on average, last year, according to Freddie Mac. ''Some people may not need a 30-year mortgage,'' said Jed Kolko, the chief economist of Trulia, the real estate information Web site.
Borrowers may also be able to reduce their mortgage rate when they enter into a ''lock-in'' agreement with a lender.
''Lenders typically offer a lower rate for a shorter lock period,'' Mr. Kolko said.
Lenders typically agree not to change an offered interest rate for 60 days, but borrowers confident of a quick closing may be willing to accept a 45-day rate guarantee, or even a 30-day lock, in exchange for a small discount, because the transaction's speed helps the lender reduce its risk.
Borrowers must make sure, too, that they consider the entire cost of a home, looking carefully at monthly payment calculations. According to Mr. Kolko, about a third of homeownership costs are in addition to the mortgage -- among them property taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs.

HEADLINE: Big Ticket: $22,375,000

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
A town house on Central Park West that comes with its own 60-foot lap pool and that sold for $22.375 million was the biggest sale of the week, according to city public records. 
Although it is not unusual for town houses on the East Side to sell for $20 million or more, the sale of 247 Central Park West was a record price for a single-family town house on the Upper West Side. It is one of just a handful of single-family homes that face the park. The previous record was $19.39 million in 2010 for 26 West 76th Street, according to Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist at Terra Holdings.
''We made a record, so hopefully we're catching up to the East Side,'' said Mara Flash Blum, a broker at Sotheby's International Realty who represented the seller, Keith D. Monda.
Mr. Monda, a former president of the luxury goods company Coach, now spends most of his time at his home in Florida. He bought the six-story West Side town house in 2006 for $15.5 million, also a record at the time. The seller at the time was Abigail E. Disney, a grandniece of Walt Disney, who had gut-renovated the house.
Mr. Monda used the home to display his vast collection of modern art. ''There was gallery wall after gallery wall,'' Ms. Blum said. ''So even though there is an elevator, if you chose to use the stairs, it was like walking up the floors of the Guggenheim or the Whitney.'' Because the interior has a very contemporary aesthetic, she said, ''we needed a buyer who wanted modernity inside a house from the 1880s.''
The house was first listed in spring 2010 at $32 million. The price was reduced to $29 million in March 2011, and to $25 million last May.
In addition to a pool, the house has a fitness/massage area; a large media room; five bedrooms, including a master suite that takes up an entire floor; two terraces; and a landscaped garden.
The new owner is Igor Iankovsky, a foreign buyer who bought the house through a limited liability company, Top Estate (NY), according to city records. The buyer was represented by Matthew Lesser, a broker for Leslie J. Garfield and Company, who said only that the house was to be used as a private home but might first be leased for a period of time.
Big Ticket includes closed deals from the previous week, ending Wednesday.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: One Percent, Many Variations

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN and ROBERT GEBELOFF

 BODY:
KINGS POINT, N.Y. -- Adam Katz is happy to talk to reporters when he is promoting his business, a charter flight company based on Long Island called Talon Air.
But when the subject was his position as one of America's top earners, he balked. Seated at a desk fashioned from a jet fuel cell, wearing a button-down shirt with the company logo, he considered the public relations benefits and found them lacking: ''It's not very popular to be in the 1 percent these days, is it?''
A few months ago, Mr. Katz was just a successful businessman with five children, an $8 million home, a family real estate company in Manhattan and his passion, 10-year-old Talon Air.
Now, the colossal gap between the very rich and everyone else -- the 1 percent versus the 99 percent -- has become a rallying point in this election season. As President Obama positions himself as a defender of the middle class, and Mitt Romney, the wealthiest of the Republican presidential candidates, decries such talk as ''the bitter politics of envy,'' Mr. Katz has found himself on the wrong end of a new paradigm. 
As a member of the 1 percent, he is part of a club whose name conjures images of Wall Street bosses who are chauffeured from manse to Manhattan and fat cats who have armies of lobbyists at the ready.
But in reality it is a far larger and more varied group, one that includes podiatrists and actuaries, executives and entrepreneurs, the self-made and the silver spoon set. They are clustered not just in New York and Los Angeles, but also in Denver and Dallas. The range of wealth in the 1 percent is vast -- from households that bring in $380,000 a year, according to census data, up to billionaires like Warren E. Buffett and Bill Gates.
The top 1 percent of earners in a given year receives just under a fifth of the country's pretax income, about double their share 30 years ago. They pay just over a fourth of all federal taxes, according to the Tax Policy Center. In 2007, they accounted for about 30 percent of philanthropic giving, according to Federal Reserve data. They received 22 percent of their income from capital gains, compared with 2 percent for everybody else.
Still, they are not necessarily the idle rich. Mr. Katz, who sometimes commutes by amphibious plane and sometimes carries luggage for Talon Air passengers, likes to say he works ''26/9.''
Most 1 percenters were born with socioeconomic advantages, which helps explain why the 1 percent is more likely than other Americans to have jobs, according to census data. They work longer hours, being three times more likely than the 99 percent to work more than 50 hours a week, and are more likely to be self-employed. Married 1 percenters are just as likely as other couples to have two incomes, but men are the big breadwinners, earning 75 percent of the money, compared with 64 percent of the income in other households.
Though many of the wealthy lean toward the Republican Party, in interviews, 1 percenters expressed a broad range of views on how to fix the economy. They think that President Obama is ruining it, or that Republicans in Congress have gone off the deep end. They favor a flat tax, or they believe the rich should pay a higher marginal rate. Some cheered on Occupy Wall Street, saying it was about time, while others wished the protesters would just get a job or take a bath. Still others were philosophical -- perhaps because they could afford to be -- viewing the recession as something that would pass, like so many previous ups and downs.
Of the 1 percenters interviewed for this article, almost all -- conservatives and liberals alike -- said the wealthy could and should shoulder more of the country's financial burden, and almost all said they viewed the current system as unfair. But they may prefer facing cuts to their own benefits like Social Security than paying more taxes. In one survey of wealthy Chicago families, almost twice as many respondents said they would cut government spending as those who said they would cut spending and raise revenue.
Even those who said the deck was stacked in their favor did not appreciate anti-rich rhetoric.
''I don't mind paying a little bit more in taxes. I don't mind putting money to programs that help the poor,'' said Anthony J. Bonomo of Manhasset, N.Y., who runs a medical malpractice insurance company and is a Republican. But, he said, he did mind taking a hit for the country's woes. ''If those people could camp out in that park all day, why aren't they out looking for a job? Why are they blaming others?''
To many, 99 vs. 1 was an artificial distinction that overlooked hard work and moral character. ''It shouldn't be relevant,'' said Mr. Katz , who said he both creates job and contributes to charitable causes. ''I'm not hurting anyone. I'm helping a lot of people.''
The Enclave
The placid sliver of Long Island that F. Scott Fitzgerald immortalized in ''The Great Gatsby'' as West Egg and East Egg seems almost to have shrugged off the recession.
A stretch of northwest Nassau County that includes Great Neck, Manhasset and Port Washington, this area has the country's highest concentration of 1 percenters, and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the state. Houses in Port Washington are worth only 10 percent less than they were at their peak, according to the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Index, a far smaller decline than in the rest of the country. Yearly sales at the Americana Manhasset, the upscale granite and glass shopping center, have already exceeded their prerecession high. Even in down times, the 1 percent has staying power, being far more likely than any other group to stay where they are rather than slip to lower rungs of the economic ladder.
''I definitely see it around me,'' said Anu Chandok, 36, an oncologist in Lake Success, referring to the country's economic pain. ''It just personally hasn't affected me yet.''
The area's residents include Anthony Scaramucci, the investor who was ridiculed for asking why President Obama was treating Wall Street ''like a pinata,'' and Bruce R. Bent, the financier now charged with fraud stemming from the Lehman Brothers collapse. Bernard L. Madoff once lived here; many of the victims of his scam still do.
But there are also people whose fortunes had little to do with Wall Street, including the founders of family businesses like J&R, the electronics retailer, and Arizona Beverages. Susan Isaacs, the best-selling writer whose crime novels -- replete with cashmere bathrobes and murdered periodontists -- draw an arch portrait of suburban life, resides in Sands Point.
In interviews, 1 percenters in this area tended to characterize their success as a product of talent and hard work, and many did indeed rise from humble beginnings. But they also tended not to dwell on the advantages conveyed by factors like race or family background. Studies show that whites have more upward mobility than blacks and that parental education level is a strong predictor of success.
Only two racial groups make up a greater share of the 1 percent than of the population as a whole: whites, at 82 percent, and Asians, at 7 percent. This corner of Nassau is 77 percent white, 11 percent Asian and only 3 percent black. Those figures include a number of large ethnic enclaves, including families of Iranian, Russian and, more recently, Chinese and Korean, heritage.
Residents say they like the area's diversity. ''As a politician, I go to black Baptist churches, Orthodox synagogues, Catholic churches,'' said Jon Kaiman, the supervisor of the Town of North Hempstead, which encompasses the area. ''Some people live in $10 million houses and some people live in half-million-dollar houses, and their kids are playing basketball together.''
The 1 percent are family-oriented, nearly twice as likely to be married as everyone else. They have more children, but not more cars, than middle- and upper-middle-class families. For them, education is critical. A vast majority of 1 percenters graduated from college, and in a whopping 27 percent of couples, both partners have advanced degrees.
Voters in this area tend to lean further left than wealthy people as a whole. Nationally, a Gallup poll found, people who make at least $500,000 a year are more Republican-leaning than everyone else (57 percent for the high earners compared with 44 percent). The respondents were more likely than other people to identify as moderate.
This part of Nassau, on the other hand, has traditionally voted Democratic, except for pockets like Manhasset. But its status as a dependably liberal stronghold can no longer be taken for granted, said Robert Zimmerman of Great Neck, a top Democratic fund-raiser. ''There's a lot more tea in the vermouth now,'' Mr. Zimmerman said.
Some factors of political change may include the shock of the financial crisis, disappointment with Obama administration policies, and the steady influx of ethnic groups that tend toward the conservative.
Defining the Wealthy
Financial benchmarks in this area can differ radically from those in places where more people are struggling to put food on the table. Many of Nassau's affluent families think of themselves as practically middle class, saying that property values and taxes are so high that $380,000 does not go very far.
''On Long Island, it's barely a living,'' said Steven R. Schlesinger, a lawyer and professional poker player. ''In Plano, it's a living.''
There is something to that. Aspen's 1 percent is very different from Akron's. In some areas there are so many 1 percenters that the whole income hierarchy can shift. It may take $380,000 to be in the national 1 percent, but it takes $900,000 to be among the top 1 percent of earners in Stamford, Conn. Compared with that, the price of admission to the 1 percent in Clarksville, Tenn., is a bargain at $200,000. Of course, the cutoff is only one measure, and perhaps not the most telling one. The average income of the 1 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center, is $1.5 million, and the superrich -- the 120,000 tax filers that make up the top tenth of this group -- earned an estimated average of $6.8 million in 2011.
The gap between rich and poor also varies widely. The 1 percent in Manhattan makes $790,000 or more, or 12 times the borough's median income. In Macon, Ga., the 1 percent is far less lofty. The cutoff there is $270,000, roughly six times the median income.
Location also affects politics. The wealthy in poorer states are more likely to vote Republican than the wealthy in rich states.
The 1 percent also has a different makeup in different cities. Nationally, for example, doctors are more likely than any other profession to be in the 1 percent -- one in five is. But in Macon, your surgeon is far more likely to make the local cut than in Manhattan, where financial managers and bankers have crowded doctors off the dance floor.
Still, David Mejias, a divorce and personal injury lawyer who once served as a Democratic legislator for Nassau County, said that the system everywhere was skewed in favor of the self-employed and business owners who could deduct part of the cost of their cars, trips, dinners and even collectibles like art.
''Not only do we make more money, but if you do a lifestyle analysis, we make a lot more money,'' he said. ''Before we even get paid, most of our life has been paid for already.''
The cutoff for the 1 percent varies depending on how income is calculated. On the low end, an analysis of census data puts the cutoff at $380,000 for a household and provides a wealth of demographic characteristics that were used in this article. On the high end, the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, which uses a broader measure of income that includes capital gains, yielded a cutoff of $690,000 in 2007, the most recent year of data available. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group, makes projections based on Internal Revenue Service data and adjusts for people who do not file taxes. It puts the cutoff at $530,000 per tax return in 2011. Even by that gauge, though, $380,000 would still put a family well above the 95th percentile. There is little current data that would allow a measurement of the 1 percent by wealth.
A higher proportion of 1 percenters (two in five) than 99 percenters (one in five) has inherited money, according to the Federal Reserve survey. The top earners got 10 percent of the inherited wealth in the country. Still, a majority of those earners reported no inheritance.
Dr. Chandok, the Lake Success oncologist, said that her husband, also a doctor, was still paying off his student loans. The couple has a nanny, but Dr. Chandok's father-in-law does the shopping and cooking.
Dr. Chandok said she had never heard the Occupy Wall Street slogan ''We are the 99 percent.'' Two children and 11-hour workdays, she said, do not leave much time for politics.
But when the slogan was explained as a complaint against the wealthy's growing share of income, she shook her head. ''I spent four years in undergraduate school, four years in medical school, three years as a resident and three years as a fellow,'' she said. ''You have to look at the people who are complaining.''
An Uneasy Silence
By e-mail or telephone, via friends or via silence, dozens of 1 percenters declined to be interviewed for this article.
Some envisioned waking up to protesters on the lawn; others feared audits by the I.R.S. or other punitive government action. A managing director at a financial firm said he did not want to dignify the rhetoric of Occupy Wall Street by participating in an article on the 1 percent. An investor who had already been the target of protesters said he feared for his family's safety.
From one vantage point, these responses may seem extreme. But there is no doubt that the troubled economy has focused anger on the fact that the rich have grown richer and the middle class, over the last decade, has lost ground. Several 1 percenters mentioned the riots in Britain and Spain; one said he kept his plane fueled up. In a recent survey, the Pew Research Center found that Americans now ranked conflict between rich and poor as stronger than timeworn clashes between immigrants and the native-born, blacks and whites, or young and old.
Many wealthy people have decried what they call class warfare. But that does not mean they think the system is not unjustly rigged in their favor. The investor who declined to be identified because he feared for his family said it was not fair that he paid a lower rate on his investment income than he would on a salary and asked why he should receive Social Security or Medicare.
But, he said, singling out the rich was not the answer. ''If you pay $50 million in taxes, is that fair or unfair?'' he asked. ''When a tax is specifically designated for a tenth of a percent of the economy, it's hard not to feel targeted.''
Perhaps he might have taken comfort in a small placard that was on view one autumn day in Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan, the center of the Occupy Wall Street protests.
''We are,'' the sign said, ''the 100 percent.''

HEADLINE: A World Without Wall Street

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
Hating Wall Street is an American tradition that dates back even to the days when Thomas Jefferson cursed that money lover Alexander Hamilton. And for centuries, the complaints about it have largely stayed the same: It does nothing! It creates chaos! It's a parasite that sucks hardworking Americans dry! (Or something to that effect.) But these are distortions of a fundamentally beneficial business. The country's largest investment banks, commercial banks and a few big insurance companies (what we generally refer to as Wall Street) play the crucial role of intermediation -- matching borrowers with lenders. Most of the time, the industry does this extremely well (though in the case of matching homeowners' debt to the global financial system, too enthusiastically). Perhaps the best way to really appreciate what Wall Street does is to imagine life without it.
THE POOR WOULD STAY POOR 
In the U.S., we use credit cards, mortgages, credit scores, securitized loans and other Wall Street innovations to do the miraculous: to persuade some institution with a lot of money to hand it over to someone who doesn't have that much. This happens even though we have laws that allow borrowers to declare they can't pay the loans back.
Sure, we have too much household debt, but that's a better problem than what most nations face. Most people in the world don't have access to a modern financial system, and there is almost no way, other than through greedy loan sharks, for the surplus cash of the very rich to get in the hands of the poor.
THERE WOULD BE NO MIDDLE CLASS
Or at least it would look a whole lot different than it does today. One of the most striking facts of life in countries without a modern financial system is the near total absence of upward mobility. The financial-services industry, however, performs a kind of fiscal time travel by pooling the nation's collective savings and transforming it into all sorts of loans. This allows people to spend money now that they won't earn until later. When spent wisely, this money borrowed from the future actually makes the future quite a bit brighter.
There is a lot of appropriate anger about excessive student debt these days, but student loans have largely changed America for the better. Countless working-class kids were able to have educations they couldn't otherwise afford. Many were able to start businesses because of easier access to credit. They were also able to sell their wares to other people who had ascended to the middle class.
LOTS OF AWESOME THINGS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN
Just about anything that makes you happy -- whether it's a lifesaving drug or just the artisanal goat cheese at the shop around the corner -- was at one point a risky project. As you read this, your money is being pooled with that of millions of other people and institutions to finance risky projects (farmers, shopkeepers, tech developers) that would freak you out if you were asked to lend to them. Your 401(k) takes your spare cash and links it to thousands of companies, many of which are making bets that you might find ridiculous. But by pooling so much capital and spreading out the risk, Wall Street creates a safe space for failure, which is an essential part of capitalism.
HOW DOES WALL STREET DO THIS?
Wall Street's core function is to perform a sort of financial alchemy, an incredibly complicated method of giving a lot of people what they want. Investors with extra cash want constant access to their money with little chance of losing any. Borrowers want to hold on to the loans for a long time and, sometimes, take big risks. Stocks, bonds, savings accounts and money-market funds are all ways of making twitchy, conservative lenders and dreamy, semi-reckless borrowers happy at the same time about the same pile of dough.
Meanwhile, consult the chart for a breakdown of how Wall Street makes money to pay for these transactions.
IS IT STILL O.K. TO HATE WALL STREET?
Absolutely. Wall Street firms enforce the cold rules of capitalism: hostile takeovers, foreclosures, fee increases, defaults. But those rules clearly do not apply to the largest banks themselves. A variety of economists (including, notably, several at N.Y.U.'s Stern School of Business) have mounted strong evidence that, over the past decade or so, a significant part of Wall Street's business has shifted from serving the financial needs of the nation to profiting from ''regulatory arbitrage'' -- making money by playing with the rules of the game. Reporting by my colleagues at NPR's ''Planet Money'' shows that a dollar spent lobbying in Washington can have a return on investment of thousands of dollars.
Another reason: Wall Street's central function is to make our financial system more robust and less susceptible to unexpected risk, but it did precisely the opposite while, maddeningly, avoiding paying the price. On the other hand, many of Wall Street's toughest economist critics do not condemn the bailouts and generous policies of the Fed and Treasury Department. Most know that Ben Bernanke, Henry Paulson and Tim Geithner (like central bankers and treasury officials everywhere) were following the hallowed advice that Walter Bagehot, onetime editor of The Economist, set down in 1873: during a crisis, a country must do everything possible to preserve its banks. And while that has resulted in making the rich even richer, our economy would be much worse off if it hadn't happened.
One lesson of this crisis is that regulation -- no matter how well intended -- cannot be trusted to rein in Wall Street. In fact, the largest financial firms have shown repeatedly an ability to take even the toughest of regulations and turn them into profit centers. So perhaps the biggest reason to hate Wall Street is that it has made so many Americans hate such an indispensable system.
Deep Thoughts This Week:
1. Americans have hated Wall street for centuries.
2. Accusations that the industry does nothing good are silly.
3. Without it, most of the things you like wouldn't exist.
4. But it's still O.K. to hate Wall street.

HEADLINE: Not for Vampires Only

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE ROSENBLUM

 BODY:
IN this dense and congested city, nirvana usually translates into bright, light-flooded spaces and eye-catching vistas. The real estate ads promise it all: ''Brilliant light!'' ''Dazzling river view!'' ''Light and bright!''
But a few people didn't get the memo. Some New Yorkers seek dim, dark spaces that admit little sense of the throbbing city just outside their doors. Maybe they work nights and need darkness and quiet so they can sleep during the day. Maybe they're writers or composers or computer programmers and need to be able to concentrate. All these people seek some version of the cork-lined room in which Proust wrote so many of his greatest works.
Real estate brokers tactfully describe these cavelike places as ''light-challenged,'' and to be sure, some people occupy them because they can't afford anything better. But especially in an economy in which ever more work gets done at home in an ever more raucous city, a tranquil space, even if hemmed in by brick walls, is some people's idea of heaven. Here are a few people who have enthusiastically embraced the dark. 
Katherine Leiner, an author, has spent much of her life in California and Colorado, but she didn't always love the sounds of nature. ''In California,'' she admitted, ''I was sometimes even bothered by the crashing of the waves.''
When Ms. Leiner, 60, moved to New York and rented an apartment in Carnegie Hill, she didn't love the noise, either. ''Even though I was on the ninth floor,'' she said, ''it was extremely noisy. The bus would rumble by every 20 minutes. I could hear the lights change.''
So when she decided to buy and made a list of her priorities, ''on the top of the list was quiet and space,'' she said, ''because I worked at home.'' Being dog-friendly was important too, ''but light was at the bottom.''
Ms. Leiner finds this interesting because she suffers from seasonal affective disorder, and the seventh-floor Classic 6 on Park Avenue that she bought in 1999 for $625,000 was a rear apartment that offers little in the way of light or views. Fern Hammond, the Halstead broker who found the apartment for Ms. Leiner, describes it as her nest.
''You'd think light would have been No. 1 on my list,'' Ms. Leiner said. ''But I have lots of ambient light, and I'm not bothered by the darkness because I'm so happy working on my books.''
Ms. Leiner, who shares the apartment with her partner, Andrew Lipton, an environmental lawyer, describes the view from her living room as Hitchcockian -- think ''Rear Window'' -- and although her office faces a garden, no city views can be seen anywhere.
''But the apartment is extremely quiet, and I need peace and quiet in order to write,'' said Ms. Leiner, the author, most recently, of ''Growing Roots: The New Generation of Sustainable Farmers, Cooks and Food Activists.''
''I can't have any distractions. In fact, it's so quiet you don't know you're in New York. And it's magic what you can do in a dark apartment by means of lighting and fabric.''
Anthony Innarelli, who describes himself as a night owl, works the 4 p.m.-to-midnight shift as an editor at NBC television and sleeps well into the morning. In his old apartment, which faced West 85th Street, he was regularly awakened at the crack of dawn by traffic and other street noises. And so he is delighted with the rear second-floor apartment at West End Avenue and 96th Street that he bought eight years ago for $280,000.
''When I get home,'' Mr. Innarelli said, ''it's already been dark for hours, so it doesn't matter if the apartment is dark. But I do need quiet so I can sleep during the day, and this apartment is extremely quiet. Quiet was at the top of my list. I'd take quiet over light anytime.''
Mr. Innarelli, who is 43, admits that the rooms can be gloomy, especially in winter. But he doesn't care. ''The living room gets no light, which is fine,'' he said, ''because all I do is watch TV there.'' As for views, ''if you look through the trees, you can see a sliver of river, but you have to have someone point it out to you.''
Mr. Innarelli now shares the space with his girlfriend, Alison Orford, a fellow television editor at the sports channel SNY who works the same hours he does. With the one-bedroom bursting at the seams, the two are seeking something larger, although whatever they choose will have to be equally quiet to accommodate their sleeping schedules.
And dark needn't mean drab, as visitors who have admired the couple's glittering array of Emmy awards can attest. ''If it's a dump and dark, that's one thing,'' Mr. Innarelli said. ''But if it's a nice place, that makes up for the darkness.''
Jeff Marder never lacked for spectacular views.
''When I lived in Los Angeles,'' said Mr. Marder, a 42-year-old conductor, keyboardist, synthesizer programmer and composer who is currently associate conductor of the Broadway musical ''Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,'' ''I had views of the mountains, the opera house and Dodger Stadium. I had all that.'' But after moving to New York, ''I decided to adjust my priorities.''
The noisiness of a series of New York apartments had worn him down. He envied musician friends who lived in quiet and peaceful settings. ''Many of these places were dark,'' he said, ''but my friends said to me they didn't mind the dark one bit.''
Given the city's stock of prewar apartment houses with thick walls, he thought it would make more financial sense to find a place in such a building than to pay for soundproofing. So last June he bought a $339,000 one-bedroom apartment in the rear of a 1925 building on Riverside Drive at 77th Street.
From inside, a person would never know if it was morning or evening, sunny or overcast. Windows face a pair of courtyards and the wall of the building next door. ''The only thing I can see,'' Mr. Marder said, ''is the super taking out the trash.''
When he was viewing the apartment, the broker made a point of switching on all the lights. She needn't have bothered. Mr. Marder was adamant about his priorities. All he cared about was quiet.
Like many musicians, he works unpredictable hours, and the quiet afforded by the location of the apartment in the rear of the building is well suited for his schedule. ''And since I moved, I do more composing than ever,'' said Mr. Marder, whose apartment is outfitted with a grand piano, multiple synthesizers and computers, and other tools of his trade. ''The lack of noise is very important in allowing me to concentrate.''
Mr. Marder recently married, and his wife, Sarah Spool, a hospital administrator, has settled happily in his dark and tomblike space. ''After we married last January,'' Mr. Marder said, ''we redid the kitchen, because she is passionate about cooking. But she's O.K. with everything else. Having the lights on a lot is just fine with us.''
Martin O'Brien, who grew up in suburban New Jersey and lived for a time in California, moved to New York in October. When he and his roommate, Janelle Hefley, began apartment hunting, the main thing they wanted was plenty of room, and they settled on a three-bedroom in a small apartment house on 116th Street in East Harlem. All the windows faced brick walls, but the apartment, which they rent for $2,000 a month, was extremely quiet, and they are savoring the peacefulness.
''It's a dark space,'' admitted Mr. O'Brien, 26, who works as a visual merchandiser. ''And there's no light in my bedroom. I have lights on timers so it feels like morning when I wake up. Otherwise it would seem like night all the time.'' For the first time since he was a child, he also has a nightlight, to add a glow to the wee hours.
But Mr. O'Brien finds tranquillity in his denlike lair. ''It's very quiet and peaceful,'' he said. ''I wanted a New York City lifestyle, but I didn't want to be surrounded by the noise. I guess I'm more of a wannabe New Yorker than the real thing.''
Ms. Hefley, who is 31 and works as a retail store manager, shares these feelings. ''She grew up in New Mexico, so she's used to a relaxed lifestyle,'' Mr. O'Brien said. ''For her, this feels like a home away from home, and she finds this place very calming.''
So does their newest roommate, Kristen LeFevre, 29, an arts administrator who arrived from Paris a few weeks ago and enjoys reading works of art history in the pale end-of-the-day light.
After Jennifer and Ed O'Connor were married two years ago, she moved into his one-bedroom on 76th Street near York Avenue. But then they began thinking about starting a family, said Ms. O'Connor, who is 34 and works for a theatrical management company. ''And we realized that we needed a second bedroom.''
In October, she and her husband, who works as a senior vice president for finance of Armani Exchange, bought a two-bedroom unit on 86th Street near Park Avenue. The apartment was in the rear, and the second bedroom was just three feet from the building next door -- ''so close you could reach out and touch the wall,'' Ms. O'Connor said.
Although none of the rooms had a view, the second bedroom also had the least natural light. ''That room had zero views and light because it faced an air shaft,'' Ms. O'Connor said. But the current occupant, a lively 3-month-old with red hair and bright blue eyes named Kieran, isn't complaining.
''It will be the baby's room until he grows up,'' Ms. O'Connor said, ''and babies could care less about views.'' The couple installed an extra lamp, and the walls, decorated with underwater decals, were kept white to make the space seem brighter. ''We figure we're set for a while,'' Ms. O'Connor said. ''Even toddlers don't want to be stuck in their rooms.''
Brokers love to trade horror stories about the challenges of finding takers for midnight-dark spaces. Some brokers even apologize when showing these properties. But some of the stories have unexpectedly happy endings, like the one told by Debra Hoffman of Corcoran about a one-bedroom at Broadway and 110th Street. A first-floor apartment, it was in the rear of the building, and every window faced a different air shaft. There were bars on the windows, although the rooms were so dim, they were barely visible.
''It was dark, dark, dark,'' Ms. Hoffman said. ''Everyone on the West Side talked about this place.
''I finally showed the apartment to a couple in which the husband was a research professor and the wife was a professional dog trainer,'' she said. ''They wanted a first floor because they had a dog and wanted easy access when the dog got elderly or fell ill. The same thing applied to other special-need dogs she trained.
''The moment they walked in the front door, they said to each other, 'It's a keeper!' They said they didn't care about light since they worked long hours and were never home during the day. And on weekends they were away in their country home, so the light didn't matter then, either.
''It's a keeper,'' Ms. Hoffman repeated. ''I'll never forget that.''
Reasons To Embrace the Dark
YOU'RE A WRITER You do your best work when you're not diverted by the hubbub on the street. ''It's so quiet that you don't know you're in New York.''
YOU'RE A MUSICIAN AND COMPOSER When you bang away at your piano in a ground-floor apartment in the rear of your prewar building, the neighbors don't complain. ''The space lends itself to being creative.''
YOU'RE AN ART COLLECTOR The last thing you need are blasts of sunlight that might cause your artwork to fade.
YOU HAVE AN ELDERLY DOG Your German shepherd has trouble climbing stairs, so you need a ground-floor apartment, even if it's black as night during the day.
YOU'RE FROM OUT OF TOWN You never got used to the bright lights of the city, so living in the dusk suits you just fine.

HEADLINE: President of Taiwan Is Re-elected, a Result That Is Likely to Please China

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Kevin Drew contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
TAIPEI, Taiwan -- President Ma Ying-jeou was re-elected by a comfortable margin on Saturday, fending off a challenge from his main rival, Tsai Ing-wen, who criticized his handling of the economy but also sought to exploit fears among voters that Mr. Ma's conciliatory approach toward China was eroding the island's sovereignty.
Mr. Ma's victory was welcomed by Taiwanese business leaders, who feared his defeat could irritate China and set back the detente that has served them well during the past three and a half years. China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade territory, had warned that a win by Ms. Tsai, whose party has traditionally backed formal independence, could threaten the ''peaceful development of cross-strait ties.'' 
Recent polls had suggested the race would be very close, raising anxiety among those who prefer the status quo. That group included some American officials, who expressed unease in private that a win by Ms. Tsai could complicate the already difficult relations between China and the United States, a longtime ally of Taiwan.
Pursuing closer ties with China -- and the money that flowed to manufacturers, hotel owners and farmers with new trade and transportation deals -- helped solidify Mr. Ma's support despite withering attacks from Ms. Tsai. More than 200,000 of Taiwan's citizens who live and work across the Taiwan Strait in China flew home to vote, most of them taking the direct flights that Mr. Ma helped establish. Not surprisingly, many returnees were Ma supporters spurred by the polls that had showed him in a close race.
''What this election showed is that business interests in Taiwan now trump ideological ones,'' said Edward I-hsin Chen, a former legislator and a professor at Tamkang University.
Mr. Ma, 61, of the Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, won with 51.6 of the vote. Ms. Tsai, of the Democratic Progressive Party, drew 45.6 percent. A third candidate, James Soong of the People First Party, who had been expected to siphon off as much a tenth of the electorate from Mr. Ma, received 2.8 percent, according to the Central Election Commission. Turnout was more than 74 percent.
''The people gave their approval of our efforts to put aside disagreements and focus on peace on both sides of the straits, turning crisis into economic opportunity,'' Mr. Ma told his supporters.
Mr. Ma's party also retained a majority in the Legislature.
The Chinese agency that handles Taiwan affairs lauded Mr. Ma's victory, according to China's state-run Xinhua news service, saying it showed that improved cross-strait ties were the ''correct path and have the support of the Taiwanese compatriots.'' The Obama administration, meanwhile, issued a statement of congratulations to Mr. Ma, saying ''Cross-strait peace, stability and improved relations, in an environment free from intimidation, are of profound importance to the United States.''
Although Ms. Tsai had moderated her party's stance on independence, many voters recalled the presidency of Chen Shui-bian, whose antagonism worsened relations with China between 2000 and 2008 and stirred concerns in the United States.
Taiwan and China have been in a formal state of war since 1949, when the Nationalists lost the Chinese civil war and fled the mainland, moving their Republic of China government to Taipei. Since then, China has not budged on its overriding goal: to bring Taiwan back into the fold, even if it requires force.
Except for Mr. Chen's presidency, the Nationalists have governed the island, including during four decades of martial law. The vote was the fifth presidential contest since Taiwan emerged from single-party rule in 1996.
In recent years, China's senior leaders have expended a great deal of political and economic capital trying to woo Taiwan's skeptical citizenry. It was a marked shift from the bellicosity of the past, when China verbally menaced Taiwan. During the presidential election of 1996, it launched missiles into the 100-mile wide Taiwan Strait.
But the margin of victory this time -- down from the 17 point spread from his first election in 2008 -- highlights the deep divisions among an electorate still wary of China's intentions.
''The true message of this election is that people in Taiwan are anxious about the future, and Beijing would be wise to note this division,'' said Richard C. Bush, director of the Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution.
Mr. Ma may find dealing with China far more challenging in his second term, analysts say. With low-hanging fruit on trade and transportation matters already picked, both sides could be forced to tackle thornier concerns, including a peace treaty, measures to protect Taiwanese investment in China and the future of the roughly 1,500 Chinese missiles aimed at the island.
The economic benefits from Mr. Ma's first term have been pronounced. They include a landmark trade agreement between the two sides, which slashed tariffs on 800 items, helping to increase Taiwan's exports to China last year by 35 percent over 2009.
And spending by mainland tourists has pumped $3 billion into the local economy.
Despite such figures, many working class and middle-class Taiwanese say they have yet to feel any trickle-down effect. In her campaign, Ms. Tsai mined anxiety over the island's slide from the 1990s, when Taiwan experienced reliably double-digit growth. Growth this year is expected to be just over 4 percent.
But a plurality of voters appeared to side with Mr. Ma's contention that improved relations with China were the island's best hope for prosperity.
Chao Pei-nan, a homemaker, 55, said there was nothing to be gained by alienating China, although she, like most Taiwanese, has no interest in unification. ''Isolation will do us no good,'' Ms. Chao said, who returned here from New Zealand last week to vote. ''In fact, the closer we get to China, the more they will see the benefits of democracy and freedom and the better the chance we have to influence them.''

HEADLINE: Rural Rebound Still Elusive

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
FOR whatever reason, homes sales picked up in New Jersey in the latter part of 2011. A new statewide market report shows contract signings increased in six of the seven months from May through November, compared with 2010.
Also, the inventory of homes for sale shrank every month since May, according to Jeffrey G. Otteau, an analyst, whose Otteau Valuation Group in East Brunswick does monthly reports for the real estate industry; he called the latest news a concrete sign that the market was ''stabilizing.''
His December report was the first one in several years to sound a hopeful note. Until the state's huge foreclosure backlog comes back on the market -- and how fast that happens is important -- the market may improve sometime this year to the point that prices stop declining and perhaps even modestly start to rise. 
But that is the statewide picture. A great division in market fortunes between northern and southern Jersey -- and urbanized areas close to Manhattan and more rural regions -- became clear during the recent recession and remains stark in the fresh statistics. Mr. Otteau predicted that the gap would shape the timing and pattern of potential recovery, and several agents in the field agreed with him.
''Simply put,'' said Dawn Rapa, a Coldwell Banker Elite agent working in rural Salem County, ''the only people I've seen selling their houses recently are those who absolutely had to -- because they were in financial disarray, a job change, divorce or death.''
Salem County, rich in historic houses and farmland but short on well-paying jobs or a quick commute to an urban center, has the largest inventory of all 21 counties surveyed: 44.5 months' worth of houses, the preponderance of them priced under $400,000.
That compares with a statewide inventory of 13 months, both over all and in the under-$400,000 category.
Several other counties in southern New Jersey have inventories about twice the size of the state average -- 29 months' worth in Cumberland County, 26 in Cape May County, and 24 in Atlantic County.
In Cape May and Atlantic, the primary backlog is for more expensive homes, many of them built in the boom years to appeal to shoreline vacationers. Atlantic has just shy of six years' worth of inventory in the $600,000-to-$1 million range.
For homes priced from $1 million to $2.5 million, the Otteau report predicted, it will take more than four years to sell the inventory in Atlantic County and close to seven years in Ocean County.
In Cumberland County, which like Salem is part of the Delaware Valley area that extends eastward from Pennsylvania, the homes are mostly priced under $400,000. There are not enough homes priced higher to be statistically significant, according to the report. Ms. Rapa said she sold 37 houses in Salem County last year, but prices were down ''considerably.'' And multiple listing numbers indicate that although inventory dipped 10 percent, there were 14 percent fewer sales over all compared with the year before.
Two of the Coldwell Banker agent's listings that have sat on the market for many months despite price drops: a restored and modernized 1851 colonial in the historic hamlet of Alloway with three bedrooms and two baths, now offered at $186,000; and a four-bedroom two-bath house on a horse farm with a barn and 10 acres in Pilesgrove, now listed for $349,900.
''We just had an offer for $312,000 on the Pilesgrove house,'' first listed in February 2011, said Ms. Rapa, ''but the owners won't go there.''
The market misery is not all concentrated in the south, however. In the northernmost county, Sussex, the inventory is 20 months. In the $400,000-to-$599,999 bracket, five and a half years' supply is already on the market.
In the town of Vernon, which is home to several popular ski areas, and where construction was booming in the mid-2000s, the average sale price of a home was $250,000 in 2007, according to the real estate Web site Trulia. Now the site has it at $100,000.
A large house set on 1.3 acres there, with a view of ski slopes from the deck, was built and sold in 2004 for $392,000. The house, with three bedrooms and three and a half baths on Cherokee Trail, has been on the market since October, and the asking price is now $358,000.
Nearby in the somewhat more affluent town of Sparta, a number of large houses built about a decade ago on one-acre or larger lots are now being offered at reduced prices or as short sales.
''Houses are selling,'' said Catherine Kut, an agent at Weichert Realtors in Sparta, ''but they have to be in fabulous condition and still occupied, as a rule.
''I had a closing yesterday,'' she said earlier this month. ''The house was $438,000, and it sold in less than 90 days, but it was a cream puff. It had almost five acres of land, a finished walkout basement, brand-new granite counters -- everything.''
Another of her listings was in great shape when it went on the market for $525,000 last February after the owner lost his job. A four-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath house, it is set on 1.3 acres and has a pool, and it was attractively decorated.
But the seller had to relocate for new employment. Now the vacant house is on the market as a short sale, in which a lender agrees to accept less than the amount owed on the mortgage, and listed at $445,000.
An ice dam formed on the roof earlier this winter and caused exterior damage, so a credit is being offered on the sale price to cover the cost of repairs.

HEADLINE: Also a-Changin': Saving World With Songs

BYLINE: By DAVID PEISNER

 BODY:
IT was never supposed to be this big.
When Amnesty International enlisted Jeff Ayeroff and Julie Yannatta to oversee a benefit album celebrating the organization's 50th anniversary this year, the plan was for something on the scale of its 2007 benefit album, ''Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur.'' ''Instant Karma,'' which Mr. Ayeroff and Ms. Yannatta also produced, is a two-CD, 23-song collection of artists like U2, Green Day and R.E.M. performing John Lennon's songs. It raised more than $4 million. So how did the organization's latest project, ''Chimes of Freedom'' -- which features Bob Dylan songs played by a genre-busting, cross-generational cast -- become a sprawling 4-CD, 73-track (76 online) behemoth? 
''This was like a rent party,'' Ms. Yannatta said of making ''Chimes of Freedom,'' which is be released on Jan. 24. ''We said: 'Like other nonprofits in this economy Amnesty needs money. Would you help?' Just about everyone said yes. You send out invitations, and when everybody shows up -- and people start calling, saying, 'We'd like to do a track too' -- it grows.''
Even a partial list of contributors is jaw dropping: Sting, Adele, My Morning Jacket, Pete Townshend, Elvis Costello, Johnny Cash, Cage the Elephant, Kesha, Miley Cyrus. All the songs but one are previously unreleased, and some of the most interesting tracks -- Silversun Pickups' spacey, hopeful ''Not Dark Yet,'' an electro-pop-tinged ''I Want You'' by the Mexican singer-songwriter Ximena Sarinana -- display the kind of creative reinvention a project like this can inspire. But the expansive lineup created a challenge.
''It's hard to get people to buy one CD these days, let alone four,'' Ms. Yannatta said.
Amnesty deserves some credit for cementing the bond between popular music and social activism. It staged variety shows in the late 1970s and early '80s called the Secret Policeman's Balls, which Bono and Bob Geldof have cited as fundamental in awakening their social consciences. After the star-studded Ethiopian famine relief benefits, Band Aid, Live Aid and We Are the World, in the mid-'80s, Amnesty began tours in 1986 and 1988, featuring U2, Bruce Springsteen and others, which helped bring its cause into the pop-culture mainstream.
By the 1990s it seemed there was no issue that couldn't be addressed by gathering sympathetic artists for an album or concert. But as music sales have fallen nearly 50 percent in the last decade, and the industry works feverishly to develop new revenue sources, it's not clear that charities have kept their fingers on the pulse of the music business.
''A lot of people say, 'I want to do a benefit record for our school' or something,'' said Michael Franti, who covers ''Subterranean Homesick Blues'' on ''Chimes of Freedom.'' ''I always say: 'Do you understand the economics of selling CDs in our current climate?' ''
As Ms. Yannatta and Mr. Ayeroff looked for a record label to release ''Chimes of Freedom,'' they discovered how much the market had changed since ''Instant Karma.'' ''Warner Brothers put a significant budget behind 'Instant Karma' at a level we quickly learned, when we started shopping this around, we weren't going to achieve,'' Ms. Yannatta said. Fontana/Universal is distributing ''Chimes of Freedom,'' but Ms. Yannatta said she realized ''we were going to have to do more with less and be creative.''
The artists, producers and engineers donated their work, and Mr. Dylan donated his publishing royalties, enabling an appealing pricing scheme: The four-CD set retails for $24.99, or $19.99 digitally. Starbucks will sell a two-CD version for $14.95. Each song will also be available individually from iTunes and other digital retailers. But a larger question looms: As streaming services, piracy, iTunes and other innovations change the way music is consumed, are benefit albums still effective ways to raise money and awareness?
In 1995 the British charity War Child raised nearly $2 million with its first album, ''Help.'' Its 2009 benefit, ''Heroes,'' produced five Top 40 singles in Britain, but raised just over $300,000.
''The big income generator was traditionally getting 15 tracks together on a CD and selling them in multiples of tens of thousands,'' said Ben Knowles, War Child's music and fund-raising director. ''That just doesn't happen anymore. With these multiartist compilations, people go, 'I'll have those four tracks.' You're making the effort of putting a 15-track compilation together for people buying four tracks. For the resources, time and effort a charity puts into an album like that you're not getting the return on investment you would've eight years ago.''
Mr. Knowles hasn't forsaken the idea of compilations altogether but plans to focus any future benefits more tightly, so consumers might invest in the whole package rather than only a few songs.
This approach is the norm for the Red Hot Foundation, which has put together 20 albums, most geared to fans of specific genres, to benefit AIDS-related charities. Its first, in 1990, ''Red, Hot + Blue,'' a tribute to Cole Porter, sold more than a million copies. Its 2009 two-CD indie-rock compilation, ''Dark Was the Night,'' has sold much less but because of lower production and marketing costs still raised more than $1.2 million.
''Rather than trying to reach everyone the way pop music does, we've narrowcasted,'' said John Carlin, Red Hot's founder. '' 'Dark Was the Night' did well because it was an indie compilation you could market in the blogosphere without much record company support or marketing dollars.''
''Chimes of Freedom'' runs counter to this narrowcasting idea, but that was the point. ''We wanted diverse people,'' said Mr. Ayeroff, a music industry veteran and former co-chairman of Virgin Records America. ''The record is designed to be an iTunes box set. If you love all 76 songs, great. But if you only love 20, it's still a deal. If some kid only wants Kesha, Miley Cyrus and Darren Criss, they pay $1.29 for each track.'' While such cherry picking could cut into album sales, Mr. Ayeroff said most of those customers would otherwise have ignored the compilation altogether.
Selling single tracks is probably of limited value though. Someone who buys Maroon 5's version of ''I Shall Be Released'' from iTunes won't get liner notes or any real information on Amnesty, and Amnesty won't capture any data on that consumer. Erin Potts, executive director for Air Traffic Control, a nonprofit organization that consults on music-related philanthropy and activism, maintains that benefit albums can still work but only as part of larger fund-raising or communications plans.
''Benefit albums on their own are blunt objects,'' she wrote in an e-mail. ''It's important to make them sharper by creating an engagement strategy around them.'' This could include ''direct-to-fan marketing tools'' that offer ''special-edition packages for fans willing to spend more money, especially for a good cause'' and a chance to collect consumers' e-mail addresses and other information.
Music for Relief, a nonprofit formed by the band Linkin Park, did something like that when it started Download to Donate after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. One donation provided access to an expanding playlist of songs by various artists.
''Our concept was to make living, breathing albums that could change over time,'' said Mike Shinoda, the group's vocalist. ''We added tracks over the course of months. If you'd made a donation, once in a while you'd get an e-mail. You'd click on the link, and there could be 5 to 25 new songs. We felt that could keep people's focus on not only the album but the cause.''
Three Download to Donate compilations have raised more than $400,000, one-tenth of what Amnesty collected for ''Instant Karma.'' Expectations are more modest for ''Chimes of Freedom'': ''Somewhere between 'Instant Karma' and zero, closer to the middle, would be awesome,'' Ms. Yannatta said. But the natural constituency for a collection of Dylan covers skews toward older fans still in the habit of buying albums, which should help. But Ken Kragen, executive producer on ''We Are the World'' and now a consultant for nonprofits, argues this has a downside.
''Every charity is looking to bring young enthusiasts into the fold,'' he said. ''This probably isn't the project that does this for Amnesty. They've got a phenomenal lineup but an old-fashioned approach. With social media now you need to tap into the ways young people listen to, buy and share music and videos in some way that's relevant and becomes viral.''
Amnesty isn't ignoring this new paradigm. On Dec. 10 it streamed the entire album on its Facebook page for anyone who clicked to ''Like'' the page. The 24-hour initiative resulted in a 15 percent increase in the page's ''Likes.'' The tracks will also be available on the subscription service Spotify, and Amnesty is posting 15 behind-the-scenes videos to YouTube. Many of the 76 tracks were also already available on YouTube through unofficial sources three weeks before the album's release. How all this will affect sales remains to be seen, but it suggests the future of benefit albums mirrors that of all albums: adapt or die.
''These need to become multimedia projects,'' said Mr. Carlin of Red Hot. He suggested ''Chimes of Freedom'' should have been offered as a phone app with ''all the music, behind-the-scenes videos, information about Amnesty and updates about political issues.''
He added: ''That would've been an exciting way to turn that unbelievable talent wrangling into an event that fit the contemporary world.''
Danny Goldberg, a longtime political activist and former record company executive who now runs an artist management company (two of his clients, Steve Earle and Tom Morello, appear on ''Chimes of Freedom''), sees the project succeeding but cautions against others following Amnesty's example.
''People should recognize that 9 out of 10 of these things don't make any money,'' he said. ''Concerts are a much more reliable source of money because that business is healthier.''
Ms. Yannatta is hopeful that ''Chimes of Freedom'' will generate a sustainable interest in Amnesty's work. The goal, she said, is unlike that of a benefit concert responding to immediate, finite crises like in New Orleans or Haiti.
''One of the challenges with the cause is that the journey of human rights is the journey of humanity,'' she said. ''That maybe gives the cause more of a marathoner's legs than a sprinter's. It doesn't stop.''

HEADLINE: Industry's Green Shoots Blossom Into Optimism

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
DETROIT
AS the recession dragged on, the Detroit auto show began to feel like boot camp for automakers, dealers and even the press: something to be doggedly endured, not enjoyed.
But the industry that has emerged from that economic trial, including American companies that nearly washed out of the corps, is showing renewed fitness.
The relief and sense of accomplishment was palpable at this year's North American International Auto Show, which opened last week for two days of press previews, as automakers rolled out an impressive wave of spit-shined recruits for showrooms.
''Everyone is on their game now,'' said Jim O'Sullivan, a third-generation Detroiter who started at Ford in 1976 and is now the chief executive of Mazda North American Operations. ''There's just nothing weak at this show.'' 
The industry's momentum was apparent at Ford, whose handsomely redesigned Fusion sedan includes gasoline, hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions, the latter promising the electric equivalent of more than 100 m.p.g.
In fact, visitors to the show, which runs through Jan. 22 at Cobo Center, might trip over all the cords to the plug-ins on display, perhaps a disconnect from a market where buyers cooled to costly electric alternatives as gas prices ebbed.
More in tune with customers is the array of stylish, feature-laden small and midsize cars and crossovers, a striking departure from times when the Detroit show floor resembled a truck stop full of guzzlers. Instead of the Hummers it once promoted, General Motors offered the Buick Encore, which is actually smaller than many compact crossovers.
Cadillac introduced the ATS to compete with the BMW 3 Series, whose new generation also made its debut here. Dodge, which built macho pickups for decades, offered the Dart, a compact based on an Alfa Romeo platform from the Fiat garage. Audi brought back the Allroad wagon, now based on the A4.
The new-model eye candy included the latest Mercedes SL convertible, a concept version of the coming Acura NSX sports car and a design study for a 2-plus-2 coupe from Lexus, the LF-LC. An unexpected splash came from Lincoln, whose remade MKZ sedan, arguably the show's most overlooked design, signaled that Ford Motor is at last serious about reviving its luxury brand.
Here are some highlights among the roughly 40 new production and concept models in Detroit:
ACURA ILX Acura's perky little sedan effectively disguises its Honda Civic roots while keeping the base price well below $30,000. Due to go on sale in April, its option list will include Acura's first hybrid powertrain, a performance version of the Civic Hybrid's 1.5-liter gas engine with an electric assist.
ACURA NSX CONCEPT Enthusiasts who've dreamed of the return of the Japanese supercar fighter will get their wish in 2015. The show-stopping NSX is a midengine V-6 hybrid concept; Acura said a production version would be built in Marysville, Ohio.
BMW 3 SERIES Four cylinders in the 3 Series is the big story at BMW, with a standard 245-horsepower, 2-liter engine in the redesigned 328i. The upscale 335i version keeps its 300-horsepower turbo 6. Buyers will see this 3 Series sedan next month, joined by all-wheel-drive and ActiveHybrid versions in the fall.
BUICK ENCORE On the size-XL heels of the Enclave, this pint-size crossover arrives late in 2012. Powered by the 1.4-liter turbo 4 from the Chevy Cruze, it offers a choice of front- or all-wheel drive.
CADILLAC ATS Cadillac unveiled its compact sport sedan last week at the Center for Creative Studies in Detroit. Resembling a small-scale CTS, the ATS, bound for showrooms late this summer, is a modern BMW fighter with three available engines and a choice of rear or all-wheel drive.
CHEVROLET CODE 130R AND TRU 14OS This pair of youth-focused design studies included the Tru 140S, a slinky ''affordable exotic'' based on the Chevy Cruze. The compact Code 130R, looking like a BMW 1 Series crossed with a Motown muscle car, offered rear drive and a decidedly unmuscular 150-horsepower 4-cylinder.
DODGE DART Reviving a name from its past, Dodge will aim its Dart at the heart of the affordable compact market beginning in the second quarter of 2012. Based on the platform of the Alfa Romeo Giulietta, and starting at $15,995 excluding delivery, the sleek sedan will offer three engines, including a powerful 184-horse turbo 4.
FORD C-MAX HYBRID AND ENERGI Ford's first standalone hybrid nameplates, the C-Max Hybrid and C-Max Energi, are gas-electric and plug-in versions of a compact Focus-based people hauler. On sale this fall, the C-Max Hybrid will deliver about 45 m.p.g. in combined city and highway driving; Ford expects the plug-in Energi to drive more than 15 miles on battery power alone and beat the Chevy Volt's federally rated mileage equivalent of 93 m.p.g.e.
FORD FUSIONFord's redesigned family sedan addresses the blind spot of the current squarish model with sleek styling -- even if that meant shamelessly cribbing design cues from Ford's former Aston Martin and Jaguar brands. Gasoline and hybrid Fusions go on sale in summer, with the hybrid targeting a class-best 47/45 m.p.g. in city and on the highway. The Energi plug-in hybrid follows this fall.
HONDA ACCORD COUPE A concept in name only, the Accord is a virtual dead ringer for the showroom coupe that will arrive this fall, together with a new sedan. The Accord will introduce Honda's first direct-injection 4-cylinder engine, upgraded to 181 horsepower. An optional 3.5-liter V-6 will soldier on, and a plug-in hybrid version rounds out a lineup that Honda will pit against challengers like the Hyundai Sonata and Volkswagen Passat.
LEXUS LF-LC CONCEPT Lexus's 2-plus-2 sport coupe sparked teenage fantasies with its intergalactic styling, though the car has a real purpose, signaling the future of Lexus design. The front-engine, rear-drive hybrid could be toned down for production in coming years.
LINCOLN MKZ CONCEPT While it may keep its nondescript model name, the Ford Fusion-based MKZ will look to shake its anonymous personality with a more distinctive design and a luxurious cabin. Including an especially graceful rear three-quarter view, the concept model offers a strong hint of what the 2013 production model will look like.
MASERATI KUBANG Jeep Grand Cherokee platform wrapped in an Italian suit, the Kubang crossover goes into production next year in a Chrysler assembly plant in Detroit. It will get a Ferrari-designed V-8 engine and Maserati-engineered steering, brakes and suspension, but lose the clunky Kubang name, to be replaced by something Italian.
MERCEDES-BENZ SL550 Slimmed down by hundreds of pounds, the aluminum-intensive SL550 convertible takes flight this spring, in time for one-upmanship in the Hamptons. Starting at $105,875, the SL features a twin-turbo 4.6-liter V-8 with 429 horsepower and a monstrous 516 pound-feet of torque.
NISSAN PATHFINDERBulging and swooping like its deluxe Infiniti JX cousin, the seven-passenger Pathfinder S.U.V. returns to a car-based structure when a 2013 production model goes on sale this fall. An improved V-6 engine will lift economy by nearly 25 percent, Nissan claims.
SCION FR-S Call it Son of Celica: The FR-S is a welcome bit of mischief from Toyota, a spunky, affordable, rear-drive sport coupe with a 200-horsepower boxer 4. The Scion's near-identical sister car, the Subaru BRZ, will also reach dealers in the spring.
TOYOTA NS4 Setting its time machine to 2015, Toyota says the swoopy NS4 previews the company's new design direction in coming years. In other words, it looks nothing like the dishwater Corolla or Camry. The concept model highlights Toyota's new global midsize platform and a more-efficient plug-in hybrid system that is being developed.
VOLKSWAGEN E-BUGSTER A chopped-roof rival to the new Mini Coupe, VW's two-seat, all-electric Beetle features a 114-horsepower motor and a claimed range of more than 100 miles.
The number of new-models introduced at the 2012 Detroit auto show suggest a growing recovery from a downturn that felled some brands entirely and caused other automakers to scale back new-model development or delay production plans. As consumers return to showrooms in coming years -- many by necessity, with the median age of the American car near record highs -- they'll be tempted by an explosion of new models.
Subtracting models lost when brands like Pontiac were shuttered, the industry's net gain in new models was just four in 2010 and 13 in 2011, according to LMC Automotive, a research firm. Looking ahead, LMC projects a turnaround in which consumers will see net gains of 47 new or redesigned models in 2012, 66 in 2013 and 47 more in 2014.

HEADLINE: Spend, Spend, Spend. It's the American Way.

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale.

 BODY:
GRIDLOCK in Congress implies that there won't be any collective decision to spend more as a nation to get out of our slump. Increases in deficit spending seem unlikely, and so does the balanced-budget stimulus I've been advocating in this column. For now, we must pin our hopes for a robust recovery on the willingness of millions of consumers to spend substantially more.
But what really drives consumer spending? Economists are reasonably good at divining how consumers tend to react to changes in government policy, but in the absence of such policy, and when the economy is in the doldrums, they aren't very good at predicting spending shifts. 
A new book, ''Beyond Our Means: Why America Spends While the World Saves'' (Princeton University Press), offers some insights. It was written by Sheldon Garon, a Princeton professor who is not an economist but rather a historian with a sociological bent.
Professor Garon says that our willingness to spend is driven most prominently by our reaction to major events in our collective memory, including wars and depressions, and that it also depends on national character, which differs across countries and through time. Spending, of course, is shaped by deliberate government policies. Notably, during wartime, governments all over the world often start huge public-information campaigns to promote saving.
The United States, however, is something of an exception. More than any other country, Professor Garon argues, it elevates consumer spending to a virtue, sometimes minimizing saving. There is even an idea here that it is patriotic to spend, rather than to save.
For example, in a speech two weeks after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush urged Americans not to be cowed: ''Get down to Disney World in Florida,'' he declared. ''Take your families and enjoy life, the way we want it to be enjoyed.'' Personal consumption expenditures increased sharply in October 2001, and the recession that had begun in March of that year came to an abrupt end by November.
In more recent times, many parallels have been drawn to the Great Depression. Presidents and prime ministers worldwide justified their stimulus packages in 2008 and 2009, for example, by saying that if these plans weren't put in place, we might repeat the economic nightmare of the 1930s. That kind of talk might have been necessary to assure support for stimulus, but it certainly hurt confidence.
And there was another problem. The truth is that stimulus packages never entirely lifted the economy out of the Great Depression. In the United States, unemployment didn't drop below 12 percent until World War II changed the picture.
In recent months, news that Christmas shopping appeared strong, at least soon after Thanksgiving, was invested with great significance. Holiday cheer, it was argued, might provide the needed stimulus. But this is an old story. In every Christmas season of the decade-long Great Depression, newspapers described a strong, even frenzied, Christmas shopping season.
Perhaps this offers a lesson in bias. It seems that during such bad times even the most respectable newspapers somehow needed to write an upbeat story for the holidays. Confidence-building is part of our culture, and it helps to explain confidence swings.
During the Depression, George Gallup began to compute confidence indexes. But sharp improvements in confidence, as reported in 1938 by Gallup's American Institute of Public Opinion, did not spell the Depression's end. Eventually, consumer demand did come roaring back-- after World War II, contrary to economists' widespread fears that the Depression would resume after the war.
Professor Garon details an attitude that Americans, more than people in any other country, have usually had about spending: we tend to think it's O.K. for people to go into debt to buy gadgets or take vacations. According to this view, such activity will stimulate everyone's imaginations, and ensure a vibrant economy with plenty of fresh enterprises and innovations. Americans even tend to think that debt burdens may not be so bad -- that people in debt work harder to pay it off, again keeping the economic engine humming. We are relatively forgiving of personal bankruptcies, too: they provide a fresh start to allow spending all over again.
IN much of the rest of the world, Professor Garon documents, this approach has traditionally seemed morally repugnant -- though until the current crisis, many people worldwide were slowly coming around to the American view.
Governments around the globe have long promoted pro-saving -- that is, anti-spending -- campaigns. Professor Garon notes that many of these campaigns flourished during wars, when frugality was a necessity to conserve resources. In World War I and World War II, government campaigns left a lasting impression that overspending was immoral and unpatriotic, and for most countries the campaigns did not stop when the wars ended.
The United States had such savings-promotion campaigns during those wars, too, but it gradually ended them afterward. By 1966, the United States had suspended its postal savings system -- which encouraged savings by allowing people to buy certificates of deposit at post offices for as little as a dollar. Many countries still have such systems, as part of efforts to make saving seem convenient and patriotic.
Low consumer confidence during the Depression could have been caused partly by fear of war, many commentators said at the time. But it is hard to measure the validity of such claims.
In any case, fear of war doesn't seem the main problem today, despite some unease about possible crises in places like Iran and North Korea. In the United States, there is concern about the economic stability of Europe, but barring a major collapse there, it is likely to remain a distant worry.
Patriotism may turn out to be a stronger force here. The killing of Osama bin Laden last year will probably be recounted over and over in this year's election campaign, which, like many campaigns before it, is certain to be filled with patriotic rhetoric. But would a patriotic surge change the mood enough for consumers to take personal risks to get on with the American Dream?
While these kinds of mental and moral factors are very hard for economists to evaluate, they may be all-important for the current outlook.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Mobility and Inequality in Today's America

 BODY:
Readers discuss how to reinvigorate the American promise that anyone can rise to success.
The Letter
To the Editor:
Re ''Harder for Americans to Rise From Economy's Lower Rungs'' (front page, Jan. 5):
America's stalled mobility is not only disheartening -- it also challenges our sense of national identity and is a threat to economic prosperity. The Horatio Alger ideal that someone born poor can, through hard work, become rich is the quintessential American promise. But for the most part it is a pipe dream.
The same Pew study cited in the article shows that in the last generation, only about 6 out of 100 poor children actually struck it big.
''Movin' on up'' is especially hard for children born poor and black, or poor and female. Black children of poor parents are half as likely as their white counterparts to become rich. They also face a much greater risk of slipping down the economic ladder: 45 percent of black children of solidly middle-income parents ended up poor, compared with 16 percent of white children. 
And despite the enormous strides women have made in the world of work, daughters of poor families were more likely to remain poor than sons (47 and 35 percent, respectively).
Education and the neighborhood where a child grows up play a huge role in determining economic success, as does family background.
What can be done? We must strengthen community colleges, where most poor children who get an education beyond high school do so; encourage partnerships between employers and community colleges; and improve economic opportunities in poor neighborhoods.
To improve mobility we must get the American jobs machine working again, creating the middle-class jobs that are the foundation of our nation's greatness.

With corporations seeking ever greater profits and work force cuts assisting that greed, gone is the progressive, enlightened notion that captains of industry must help build an upwardly mobile society.
There is little sense of a corporate responsibility to invest in America by investing in people. Ironically, these people are the would-be consumers who could add to the sacred bottom line.
Until there is a return to such responsibility, not only will the middle class continue to shrink, but also the poor far down the ladder will not even get to the first rung.
ARTHUR HENRY GUNTHER III Blauvelt, N.Y., Jan. 12, 2012
I applaud the sentiments expressed in Ms. Blackwell's letter, but I am afraid that her solution is far from adequate. As Paul Krugman has pointed out, the incomes of non-wealthy college graduates have also stagnated. If you want to increase upward mobility and reduce inequality, you have to look at what policies have been responsible for the giant rise in economic inequality in the United States.
Here are some of the policies you could change:
Reverse the war on unions, which were responsible for creating and maintaining the middle class in America. Strengthen the National Labor Relations Board and enforce the laws.
Return to more progressive tax rates and higher real corporate taxes. This will encourage the rich to leave their profits in their companies and the companies to spend on hiring more workers and paying them better.
Create a universal government-run health care system such as all other developed nations enjoy. This would eliminate the reason that so many people have moved down the ladder -- health care expenses.
LEONARD S. CHARLAP Princeton, N.J., Jan. 11, 2012
Those who make the claim that mobility is limited in this country live in a different America than I and my immigrant family have experienced. Sure, things are tough now for everyone, but our story is common enough to keep us confident about the real opportunities that exist in the United States.
My father's parents came here through Ellis Island -- with nothing. They made their way by working with their hands (my grandfather was a carpenter). Their five children have all realized opportunities greater than their parents, and their many grandchildren, including a veterinarian and three with M.B.A. degrees, are living the American dream beyond the expectations of our humble grandparents.
Perhaps equating outcomes with opportunity is behind what is driving the notion that mobility is now more limited. We have always had unequal outcomes -- and under times of stress and change these tend to be magnified. But there is still no other country in the world where people would rather come to in the search for success than the United States.
FRANK SALVO New Canaan, Conn., Jan. 11, 2012
To address the economic and social inequity of Americans, particularly of black, Hispanic and female poor, Ms. Blackwell identifies strengthening community colleges as one solution. But by the time poor students are college age, their weak educational foundations compromise sound academic progress.
The fact that primary and secondary schooling is paid for in the United States largely by real estate taxes is the root cause of inequality in education, and hence opportunity. Poor neighborhoods with low tax revenue from low housing values cannot match the funding of schools in communities with strong tax bases. The United States needs to distribute the money equitably from one collective pot, as is the case in most European countries, where mobility is now greater than ours.
The inequality among our public schools is yet another example of the shredding of the principles upon which this country was founded.
LORN MacDOUGAL Austin, Tex., Jan. 11, 2012
Societies demonstrating more economic and social mobility than the United States -- for instance, the Scandinavian countries -- also demonstrate a strong commitment to reducing income inequality and to guaranteeing early childhood education and universal health care. So long as Americans refuse to learn from the successes of other societies, we will be complicit in continuing the social stagnation and limited life chances for millions of our fellow citizens.
ALAN POSNER East Lansing, Mich., Jan. 11, 2012
Ms. Blackwell's solutions -- upgrading community colleges and linking them to employers, opening up economic opportunities in poor neighborhoods, and developing good jobs -- are praiseworthy. The difficulty is not in deciding what to do, but determining how to do it, especially in a time of political gridlock.
BRAD BRADFORD Upper Arlington, Ohio, Jan. 12, 2012
Ms. Blackwell quite rightly notes that the Horatio Alger notion is a pipe dream. In 1973, Stephan Thernstrom published ''The Other Bostonians,'' in which he systematically exploded the ''rags to riches'' ideal to which, still, so many Americans cling.
Rather than striking it big, Americans experienced what social mobility they actually had by standing on the shoulders of their parents. Day laborers became skilled laborers or lower-level white-collar workers; marriage provided mobility for women; and blacks were America's permanent underclass, experiencing almost no mobility.
While there have been some gains made by women and blacks since Mr. Thernstrom wrote the study, the basic process of mobility, I suspect, has not changed much. Young men and women gain social mobility by standing on their parents' shoulders or they have little to no mobility; education plays a key role in determining which one.
JAMES C. WILLIAMS Deland, Fla., Jan. 11, 2012
The writer is professor emeritus in American history at De Anza College, a community college in California.
College is not the answer for poor children who want to escape poverty. The answer to leveling the playing field is to make college unnecessary for job readiness.
I am dismayed at the middle and high school curriculums my children study, which prepare them for little more than to be contestants on ''Jeopardy.'' Most of what they're memorizing are facts they can look up if they ever need them.
If high school students were learning marketable skills, such as proficiency in software programs like Word, Excel and PowerPoint, or learning to drive a truck or to be a medical assistant, they would qualify for well-paying jobs right out of high school.
AGNES ALLMAN Plymouth, Mich., Jan. 11, 2012
No question, the most economically fragile segments of our society have been hit the hardest by what seems to be the permanent loss of jobs across the economy. However bleak the prospects of the working poor, they are no longer alone in their pessimism. All but a few of us are struggling now with a sense of lowered expectations, and although ''trickle-down economics'' may have been discredited when it comes to sharing prosperity, it may very well hold true when it comes to sharing scarcity.
But what can be done to turn this economy around and have it work for those who make the effort?
Poverty in the minority community and among women is directly linked to single-parent households. Better and more comprehensive counseling of young men and women, starting among preteenagers, can help reduce the number of single mothers, and heightened enforcement of parental-support obligations can ease their financial struggles.
For all segments of the job market, regional employment opportunities must be identified and curriculums jointly planned by local employers and community colleges to train students to fill those positions.
Unless this nation promotes those industries that can serve our future needs and then encourages educational opportunities for young people to serve in those industries, the next generation will find itself in a race to the bottom.
JOHN R. ARMSTRONG Absecon, N.J., Jan. 11, 2012
I'd suggest reframing the debate. Why consider only financial capital while measuring upward (or downward) mobility? Sociologists have long identified at least two additional measures of capital: social and cultural.
Individual mobility should always be considered in relationship to the social and cultural milieus within which that person functions. It is likely that many people occupy different locations on each scale, and those locations change throughout one's lifetime.
JEFF FRIEDMAN Woodbridge, N.J., Jan. 11, 2012
The Writer Responds
The nation's mobility problem is linked to our broader economic crisis of slow growth, increased inequality and a withering middle class. To solve it, we need a bold policy agenda to build a more equitable economy: one that provides many more middle-class jobs and opportunities for everyone to reach his or her full potential -- particularly those who've been left furthest behind.
This is even more urgent as our country undergoes a rapid demographic transformation. By 2042, the majority of the population will be people of color. Without policy shifts, too few of today's immigrants will share Mr. Salvo's experience of making it in America.
Readers contributed many important elements of this agenda. Ensuring that workers get a fair return on their labor is critical. As Mr. Gunther reminds us, putting more income in the hands of workers means more consumers, a better bottom line and a stronger economy. Fairer tax policies and stronger organized labor are also important, per Mr. Charlap.
Investing in people is fundamental, which means improving education at all levels. Ms. MacDougal is right: the public education system stops working for poor black and Latino children way before college. Neighborhood-based ''cradle to career'' educational programs like the Harlem Children's Zone and the federal Promise Neighborhoods initiative inspired by it are helping children and their communities overcome tremendous odds. These programs need to be the rule rather than the exception.
America's growing diversity will be a valuable asset in the global economy if we take steps now to reduce disparities. Equity is no longer just a moral imperative -- it is also an economic one.

HEADLINE: Foreclosure Auctions in Phoenix Show a Raw Form of Capitalism

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- To the unknowing, the few dozen people milling around the picnic tables in front of the Maricopa County courthouse here every day could be jurors on break or scofflaws finally coming to pay a ticket. They tug on cigarettes, sip from big cups of coffee and fidget with their cellphones, often speaking in whispers.
But instead of waiting to meet a judge, they are preparing to bid on the hundreds of foreclosed properties auctioned each week in one of the country's more colorful public clearinghouses. During the housing boom, when mortgages were being given out with no money down and prices soared, the auctions were a sleepy sideshow. But in the years since, the auctions have grown into a scruffy economic circus where bargain hunters from around the world have scooped up houses often sold for less than half of the value of the mortgage.
The auctions look more like a low-end poker game than the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The bidders and auctioneers, most of them men in their 20s and 30s, are on a clubby first-name basis, and their banter can border on sophomoric. But their trading serves a critical if somewhat heartless function: to find new buyers for houses so they can be fixed up and sold to more stable owners. 
''This is capitalism at its rawest,'' said Brad Grannis, a bidder from AZ Property Advisors. ''There's an asset, and people assign a value to it.''
In recent months, the auctions have become more competitive because of an influx of outsiders who are eager for cut-rate houses that they can resell or rent out and because of a decrease in the number of houses available. There were 2,296 trustee sales in Maricopa County last month, 44 percent fewer than in December two years ago during the depths of the market crash, according to The Cromford Report, a real estate newsletter.
Many economists say that the housing market has a long way to go before it returns to health and that the decline in foreclosures is partly because lenders, often under political pressure, are trying to work with distressed borrowers.
But optimists in Phoenix point to the decline as a harbinger of an upturn, albeit a tentative one.
''We went lower than anywhere except Las Vegas, and we got through the foreclosure crisis faster,'' said Mike Orr, a researcher at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University and the editor of The Cromford Report. ''I don't know if this will be a significant recovery, but even going up a few points is still a recovery.''
The courthouse auctions have a bloodlessness that belies their impact on people's lives. Every day, in the rain, morning chill or scorching heat, a half-dozen auctioneers set up shop on the picnic tables in front of the courthouse. They flip open their laptops and read off the addresses of the properties for sale, the value of each mortgage, the taxes due and the opening bid, which the seller determines. Homeowners' names are never mentioned.
The bidders, many wearing jeans, hoodies and the occasional nose ring, work for investors who rarely attend the actual bidding. Increasingly, those investors come from Canada, China and other countries where Arizona property looks like a bargain. Local investors say these newcomers, as well as hedge funds, have driven up prices and made it harder to turn a profit.
The bidders register with each auctioneer and must produce a $10,000 certified check. They consult their spreadsheets on clipboards or iPads, which list the homes for sale. Many wear earpieces connected to cellphones so they can instantly relay the prices during the auction to their bosses, who know the limit of their clients.
''There's no emotion in the bidding,'' said Mary Nicholes, who runs the Home Ownership Center of Arizona, which bids on behalf of investors who want to rent out their homes. ''They all have their number.''
The bidding moves quickly, but there are no secret signals and bidders rarely make eye contact. The regulars help one another, and they will also cheer or encourage colleagues as if they were investing their own money. ''You got a hole in one!'' one bidder yelled to another who had just bought a house with virtually no bidding. Bidding companies are typically paid a flat fee of about $2,500 or 3 percent of the purchase price, with a share of that money going to the bidder.
No rules are posted, but the bidders obey a strict code, the cardinal rule of which is that those who fail to pay their bills can no longer bid. One former bidder earned the nickname Runaway Bride after she won an auction for the wrong house, panicked and fled the scene without paying her $10,000 deposit.
Individual bidders show up, too. Christopher St. John, a longtime broker in Phoenix, recently went to bid on a house that was near another one that he bought and resold last year, making a $16,000 profit. Bidding at the auction started at $119,700 and zoomed past Mr. St. John's limit of $125,000. The auctioneer, in chinos, a golf shirt and a Diamondbacks baseball cap, eventually sold the house for $158,000.
Mr. St. John thought the house was worth no more than $175,000, and because he would have to pay about $15,000 to fix it and cover any fees and taxes, bidding that high did not make sense to him. But to well-heeled investors, a smaller profit was acceptable, he said.
''It's amazing how different it is now and how many more people there are,'' he said. ''It's a battle to get properties.''
At times, the auctioneers and bidders are confronted with the reality of what they are trading. Some homeowners come to see their houses sold and vent their anger. A few bring video cameras to film the auction, trying to intimidate the bidders. Every so often a homeowner, having walked away from the mortgage, will bid on his own house. In recent weeks, protesters from the Occupy Phoenix movement camped in the park across the street have stopped by to appeal for an end to the auctions.
For some bidders, the intrusion is another reminder of the hardship that they themselves are enduring. This month, Kelly Galles started working as a bidder after a bout with cancer forced her to give up her job teaching preschool. Her husband, who worked in construction until the downturn, is one of the auctioneers. Lured to Arizona from California during good times, they bought a house that is now worth less than what they owe on it.
''It's a pretty exciting job,'' she said. ''The downside is these are people's homes. We're lucky not to be here ourselves.''

HEADLINE: Auto Industry May Want to Look at That Luxury-Car Plan Again

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren writes a column for The Chicago News Cooperative.
While shoveling out a Honda Civic on Friday morning, I was reminded of my utterly utilitarian perspective on cars. I want them to get from Point A to Point B efficiently. That's it.
My thinking is one reason Howard Tullman says he believes the American auto industry is deluded, despite its current euphoria over increased sales. 
''The thrust of Detroit's thinking is that they are still speaking to people who have a personal, emotional connection to the vehicle they operate. It's a complete miscalculation, certainly of any person under 35,'' said Mr. Tullman, who has deep ties to the industry.
When I noted that General Motors was heralding expensive new luxury models in its Buick and Cadillac divisions at the Detroit auto show and forthcoming Chicago auto show, the man who has often advised auto's hierarchy scoffed. ''Rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,'' he said.
Mr. Tullman, 66, is a lawyer turned serial entrepreneur, a driven, self-promoting and well-connected pragmatist. His Rolodex may match that of his chum Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who resided with Mr. Tullman during the election campaign while the candidate's family was in Washington.
He is president of Tribeca Flashpoint Media Arts Academy, a profit-making private Chicago college focusing on digital arts and entertainment technologies. He started it as Flashpoint in 2007 and is now partnered with Tribeca Enterprises, the New York company founded by, among others, Robert De Niro.
Mr. Tullman is a sharp observer of rapid technological and cultural change. At a private dinner on Tuesday, he gave the audience a succinct overview of social media -- and inadvertently piqued my curiosity about cars.
His presentation detailed four trends: hyperpersonalization, by which one can direct one-on-one messaging to millions of people; accountability in measurement, which allows advertisers to demand concrete metrics on their results; our being constantly tethered to other people and decision-making information, thus letting us walk through one store while pricing the same products at another on smartphones; and a significant lowering of barriers to starting a business.
''He has incredible value as a liaison between the digital generation and an older one,'' said Jane Hanna, 30, the social media strategist for the Field Museum, who attended the dinner. ''He's a powerful voice to connect the two.''
Those under 35, he declared, don't care much about privacy or accuracy as they give away personal information on Facebook and elsewhere.
Jack Fuller, an author and former president of the Tribune Publishing Company, was struck by ''the radical democratization of judgments about accuracy and importance'' that Mr. Tullman detailed, while the lawyer-author Scott Turow was not quite so sure people would surrender as much privacy once they realized what they were doing. But this was all after Mr. Tullman told me at dinner his views of Detroit, based on ample experience.
He founded CCC Information Services, which maintains databases on the value of used cars for insurers settling theft and total loss claims; was board chairman of Colbalt Group, which provides digital marketing and economic solutions to the industry; and founded Original Research II, which asked car buyers about sales and service satisfaction.
''When I see G.M. doubling up on luxury cars due to their profit model, I can't help but think they're missing the boat again,'' he said.
A younger generation wants fuel-efficient, utilitarian vehicles, he said, if they want them at all. The calculation will change somewhat when they become parents and need a child's car seat. But they will opt for smaller, safer and less expensive cars, he said.
Culturally, Mr. Tullman points to the disappearance of ''grease monkeys.'' We don't learn how to repair a car anymore because it takes ''a $250,000 computer diagnostic system to do it,'' he said. ''You don't learn how to fix a carburetor in vocational ed class.'' That's gone, he said, and with it the realms of car enthusiasts who craved swanky or mechanically souped-up vehicles.
''The few exceptions are Hispanics -- the last of the car cultures -- and crazy Californians who obsessively paint their cars,'' he said. A subgroup of remaining car fanatics is ''big-city gangbangers and rap stars with their Escalades.''
Finally, he says he continues to be struck by the absence of women in upper management. ''If you don't have a feminine, ecological, environmental side,'' he said, ''it will be very hard to address this new market.''

THE VIEW FROM LAZY POINT: A Natural Year in an Unnatural World, by Carl Safina. Illustrations by Trudy Nicholson. Maps by Jon Luoma (Picador/John Macrae, $18.) Safina, a marine ecologist, reflects on nature's connectedness in a series of field reports from his home on the shore of eastern Long Island and his travels to the Arctic, the Antarctic, the Caribbean and the Pacific Islands. 
PANORAMA, by H. G. Adler. Translated by Peter Filkins (Modern Library, $16.) A death-camp survivor and Holocaust studies pioneer, Adler (1910-88) wrote this novel, a thinly disguised autobiography, in 1948. Appearing in English only last year, it's a series of vignettes depicting scenes in the life of its protagonist: from World War I-era Bohemia to torturous years at a German boarding school to an extermination camp and, finally, exile abroad.
HOW WARS END: Why We Always Fight the Last Battle, by Gideon Rose (Simon & Schuster, $17.) This chilling history of American intervention, from World War I to Afghanistan, examines the challenges facing presidents and their advisers during the final stages of conflict. Rose, the editor of Foreign Affairs, says most leaders have ''stumbled across the finish line without a clear sense of what would come next or how to advance American interests amid all the chaos.''
THE BORDER LORDS, by T. Jefferson Parker (New American Library, $15.) An undercover A.T.F. agent goes rogue in the fourth novel in Parker's gritty series featuring the Los Angeles sheriff's deputy Charlie Hood and the rampant gun smuggling that powers the drug trade between Mexico and the United States.
THE CRISIS OF CAPITALIST DEMOCRACY,by Richard A. Posner(Harvard University, $18.95.) Following up on ''A Failure of Capitalism: The Crisis of '08 and the Descent Into Depression'' (2009), which took the financial regulatory system to task, Posner calls for economists to embrace some of John Maynard Keynes's original ideas and warns that Congress is rushing to devise remedies for a crisis we have not yet properly grasped.
SISTER, by Rosamund Lupton (Broadway, $14.) In Lupton's first novel, the death -- perhaps it was murder -- of a free-spirited woman named Tess forces her highly conventional sister, Beatrice, to examine their relationship. Had Beatrice been too wrapped up in her New York life to see that Tess, an artist in London, was in trouble? In a soul-searching letter to her dead sister, Beatrice retraces the chronology of her struggle to learn how and why Tess died.
THE NEW JIM CROW: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, by Michelle Alexander (New Press, $19.95.) Taking aim at the ''war on drugs'' and its impact on black men, Alexander, a legal scholar and civil rights lawyer, argues that the criminal justice system is being used to create ''a lower caste of individuals who are permanently barred by law and custom from mainstream society.''
WHILE MORTALS SLEEP: Unpublished Short Fiction, by Kurt Vonnegut (Dial, $16.) These posthumously published stories, written early in Vonnegut's career, capture the ethos of postwar America: tales of unremarkable lives and the ideals of fortune, fame and love that twist them in surprising ways.

HEADLINE: Dear Starbucks: A Penny for Your Thoughts

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
STRONG coffee gets me out of bed in the morning. I start gulping it at home, and after a train ride into Penn Station I usually stop at a Starbucks in Times Square for another jolt.
On Jan. 3, my first working day of the year, I got a jolt all right. So did hundreds of other Starbucks customers in Manhattan.
Until that morning, a ''tall'' cup of coffee -- 12 ounces of joe -- cost less than $2. In that blissful, prelapsarian time, you would hand over two $1 bills and get back coffee and some small change -- 9 cents, actually, but it seemed inconsequential. I usually dropped the coins into the tip jar, not so much out of generosity but selfishness. Why carry those annoying coins in my pocket?
That was so naive. 
Now Starbucks is making a certain class of New Yorkers count pennies. On Jan. 3, without warning, it set the net price of a tall cup of coffee in Manhattan at precisely $2.01, including tax.
Starbucks menu boards list the new price as $1.85. But when it's time to pay, and when local taxes are added to the bill, a tall cup of coffee comes to $2.01.
Libby Schmais, a novelist who works part-time as a researcher at JPMorgan Chase, confronted the new price at the cash register of a Starbucks on Park Avenue near 48th Street.
''I didn't have the penny,'' she said. The barista reached into the tip jar -- into which Ms. Schmais had intended to put her change -- took out a penny, and put it in the cash register. This also happened to me when I offered the barista an extra dollar in Times Square. She wouldn't take it, and dipped into her tip jar instead -- a practice that would cut the baristas' income, if it continued.
Ms. Schmais wasn't especially irked by the price increase, which comes to 10 cents for a tall cup. But that orphaned penny had her fuming.
''It's the stupidity of it,'' she said, ''It's what I'd call 'the annoyance factor.' It's ridiculous. Why the extra penny? Who has pennies? Didn't anyone think this through? Couldn't they round down or even up? Why leave it at a penny?''
When David Turnbull presented two $1 bills for coffee at the Starbucks on Astor Place, he met the same problem. He wasn't carrying any pennies. ''I can't believe it,'' he said. ''Now I need to walk around with pennies? Who could possibly think a price of $2.01 makes sense?''
Ari Melber, a Seattle native who writes for The Nation, was forced to fumble for change at a Starbucks on the Lower East Side -- and the new price tag also struck him as puzzling.
''Growing up in Seattle, I feel I know the company well,'' he said. ''This is a scientific company that studies everything it does very carefully. They tend to know what they're doing. So I wonder, how could this absurd price happen? Is it an oversight, or a really smart, invasive strategy to encourage people to carry change -- or maybe shift to plastic?''
I tried to find out.
In a cordial telephone conversation, Jim Olson, Starbucks' vice president for global corporate communications, said the company's prices vary from place to place, but for competitive reasons it chooses not to list them. He assured me that Starbucks ''thinks holistically about prices and about the total value it provides its customers,'' and said it certainly was aware that it was raising the tall coffee price in Manhattan to $2.01. ''It wasn't an accident,'' he said.
While he wouldn't provide numbers, he said that only a small proportion of customers buy just a tall coffee when they visit a Starbucks, and that an even smaller proportion pay in cash.
''If you bought a coffee and, say, a bagel, you might not notice the price so much,'' he said. People who pay with credit and debit cards, or with Starbucks prepaid cards or iPhone apps or reward cards are likewise insulated from the penny shock. And many popular items -- including larger coffees, as well as lattes and Frappuccinos -- haven't gone up in price, he said.
Moreover, prices didn't go up nationwide, only in Starbucks stores in the Northeast and much of the Sun Belt. And as it turns out, the $2.01 price for a cup of coffee may not exist anywhere but Manhattan. Mr. Olson wouldn't say.
Perhaps by design, the company's regional pricing resembles a patchwork quilt. Even in the New York metro area, where the price of a tall cup of coffee rose 10 cents, the actual price in stores depends on the town or borough in which you buy your coffee. With the help of family and friends, I conducted an informal survey. In Brooklyn, the home borough of Howard Schultz, the Starbucks founder, a tall cup in Park Slope cost $1.91, with tax. In Great Neck in Nassau County and in West Nyack in Rockland County, it cost $1.79, with tax.
In other words, if you leave Manhattan, you don't have to pay $2.01.
Still, Manhattan is the media capital of the world, and journalists tend to drink strong coffee. Even if the $2.01 price is a tempest in a teapot, the one-cent storm was sure to be noticed.
Reporters are expected to call experts for comment, so I did.
Andrew M. Barish, an equity analyst at Jefferies & Company in San Francisco, said that from the standpoint of corporate earnings, in a volatile environment for commodities like coffee and milk, a modest retail increase like this would most likely keep Starbucks right on track. Each day, the company's stock seems to be flirting with a new high. ''They're doing a lot of things right,'' he said. ''Maybe not setting this price at $2.01, but a lot of things.''
DAN ARIELY, the behavioral economist at Duke University, said that ''making people pay in pennies is obviously a very annoying thing,'' but that people make initial purchasing decisions based on the posted price, not the price at the cash register.
''If the experience at the cash register is annoying enough, it might cause people to make a change,'' he said. But that may be good for Starbucks if it induces people to buy more expensive items that haven't risen in price, or if penny shock switches people to using credit cards. ''We know that people using credit find it easier to buy more,'' he said.
Furthermore, Professor Ariely said, Starbucks may want to gradually move its prices even higher, ''so it may have been time for Starbucks to breach the $2 price barrier for a tall coffee and get people thinking differently.''
Peter E. Rossi, a marketing expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the unusual pricing touches on a national issue. It ''exposes the absurdity of our current currency system, the feeling among many people that we need to get rid of the penny,'' he said.
There are, in fact, continuing efforts in Congress to abolish the penny. Mike White, a spokesman for the United States Mint, said a penny cost 2.41 cents to produce last year. ''Basically,'' he said, ''it's cost more than a penny to make the penny since 2006.'' Research is under way into cheaper methods.
So is penny shock more important than the pleasure of sipping a strong cup of coffee?
Caffeine addiction is a powerful thing. I wrote most of this column while sipping Starbucks coffee, and I'm counting my pennies and saving extra change for the tip jar. For his part, Professor Ariely expected to be in Manhattan this weekend.
''I will be buying a tall coffee at Starbucks myself,'' he said. He'll go for the full experience and pay cash.

HEADLINE: Bargaining for a Child's Love

BYLINE: By HENDRIK HARTOG. 
A professor of history at Princeton and the author of ''Someday All This Will Be Yours: A History of Inheritance and Old Age.''

 BODY:
Princeton, N.J.
ECONOMIC malaise and political sloganeering have contributed to the increasingly loud conversation about the coming crisis of old-age care: the depletion of the Social Security trust fund, the ever rising cost of Medicare, the end of defined-benefit pensions, the stagnation of 401(k)'s. News accounts suggest that overstretched and insufficient public services are driving adult children ''back'' toward caring for dependent parents.
Such accounts often draw on a deeply sentimental view of the past. Once upon a time, the story line goes, family members cared for one another naturally within households, in an organic and unplanned process. But this portrait is too rosy. If we confront what old-age support once looked like -- what actually happened when care was almost fully privatized, when the old depended on their families, without the bureaucratic structures and the (under)paid caregivers we take for granted -- a different picture emerges.
For the past decade I have been researching cases of family conflict over old-age care in the decades before Social Security. I have found extraordinary testimony about the intimate management of family care: how the old negotiated with the young for what they called retirement, and the exertions of caregiving at a time when support by relatives was the only sustenance available for the old. 
In that world, older people could not rely on habit or culture or nature if they wanted their children to support them when they became frail. In an America strongly identified with economic and physical mobility, parents had to offer inducements. Usually, the bait they used was the promise of an inheritance: stay and take care of me and your mother, and someday you will get the house and the farm or the store or the bank account.
But of course what was at stake was never just an economic bargain between rational actors. Older people negotiated with the young to receive love, to be cared for with affection, not just self-interest.
The bargains that were negotiated were often unstable and easily undone. Life expectancies were considerably lower than they are now, but even so, old age could easily stretch for decades. Of course, disease, injury, disability, dementia, insanity, incontinence -- not to mention sudden death -- were commonplace, too. Wills would be left unwritten, deeds unconveyed, promises unfulfilled, because of the onset of dementia or the meddling of siblings. Or property was conveyed too early, and then the older person would be at the mercy of a child who no longer ''cared'' -- or who could not deal with the work of care.
Consider one story, drawn from a court case in New Jersey that ended in 1904. George H. Slack had been a carpenter and a contractor in Trenton, living in a house with his wife, their daughter, Ella Rees, and her husband and daughter.
According to witnesses, the father's syphilis had eroded his capacity to conduct business. He was not insane or incompetent, but he was increasingly deaf and uninterested in the world. According to one son, his father had become ''cranky and hard to get along with, and he would go into the stable and flog the horses until the neighbors would interfere.'' He was ''drowsy and sleepy all the time.'' He was gluttonous and depressed and didn't clean himself, the son remembered; the family ''had to force him to wash himself, he was so dirty.'' The other son recalled that Ella had difficulty ''getting him to change his underwear.''
Sometime in 1899 or 1900, Ella and her family moved to a house nearby. One brother claimed that their father had ordered her out of the home, but Ella insisted she had left because she could not take it any longer. ''My mother was insane,'' she later recalled, ''and I could not get along with her.''
What ''insane'' meant to her is impossible to reconstruct in modern diagnostic terms. But in November 1901, Ella's mother wandered away from the house. She began to walk north along the Delaware River. Eventually, she was found in the river's cold water by a trapper. She was taken to a farmhouse where her clothes were dried and she was given something warm to drink. And then she was taken back to Trenton.
Ella returned briefly to care for her mother, but on Christmas Eve, Ella's own daughter became ill, and, as she put it, ''I was called home'' -- that is, to her own house. When she left, her father told her that ''you will move back home with me again.'' But she replied, ''No, Father, the way Ma's mind is no one can get along with her here, she knows she's boss, and no one can get along with her, and I cannot come back here.''
At that point, Mr. Slack promised his daughter, ''If you will come home, I will deed my property to you.'' He said his Civil War pension would be enough to live on. But Ella was unswayed. ''I said I wanted them to live and enjoy all they had,'' she said.
Though she would not move back in with her parents, even with a promise of property, she did come back two or three times a week to clean house and provide care. But then, in spite of her resolve, her mother ''got so bad,'' Ella said later, that she had to move back. Finally, in the early summer of 1902, her mother was placed in the Trenton Asylum for the Insane, where she died on Aug. 10, 1902.
On the day of his wife's death, Mr. Slack left his home and moved in with Ella. Two days later, he collapsed in her bathroom. He rallied and called for doctors and for a lawyer to draft deeds that transferred his property to Ella. That done, in two days he was dead.
At her father's funeral, Ella's brothers asked if she knew about the property their father had left. She said that Pa had told her not to say anything until after the funeral. Her brothers pressed her, and she told them that the property had been left to her. One brother asked her if she ''thought that was right.'' She replied that it was -- because, as she later recounted, ''I had stayed home and sacrificed all my life for them.'' The brother told her ''then and there'' that he would fight her in court, she later testified.
SO much has changed since the early 20th century in the physical, economic and familial lives of older people, as well as in the work lives of their adult children, particularly women. We live in vastly different ways than Mr. Slack's family did. Our moral and relational expectations have changed as well. Everyone who studies old-age care concludes that family members still do a great deal. Yet the care they offer is typically enmeshed with and dependent on bureaucracies and on the labor of others: home health care attendants, hospital orderlies and hospice aides, many of whom are recent immigrants. To provide care as a middle- or upper-class family member is ordinarily to manage or help manage the care for a disabled or aging parent, not the work of cleaning bedsheets, helping a parent into a bathtub, changing a diaper.
Comparisons between the present and even the not-so-distant past are always awkward and incomplete. Still, stories like that of Ella Rees challenge an easy celebration of family care and household intimacy in an imagined past. When 19th- and early 20th-century family members negotiated with one another around needs and care, the outcomes were only occasionally happy. Their insular world was a very dark world for old-age care, because there was so little support beyond blood relations.
Dependency and disability still confront us as facts of life. There is little happiness in the inevitable but unpredictable decline that awaits all of us. And many younger people still experience themselves as trapped by a sense of duty to care for older relatives. Yet few of us are trapped as Ella Rees was. Our traps are different, often of our own making, and incorporate the work of others.
We may not love the bureaucracies and the institutions that shape our lives today. But would many of us really want to live in a world without them?

HEADLINE: Save the Date, But Watch the Movie First

BYLINE: By HEATHER SCHULTZ

 BODY:
AT first, it looked like any other e-mail. But when friends and relatives of Katharine Wentz and Christopher Mazza clicked on the Vimeo video link inside the message, they were treated to a ''save the date'' show.
Music began to play -- Mungo Jerry's ''In the Summertime'' -- and a video of Ms. Wentz, a fitness coordinator who lives in Holmdel, N.J., and Mr. Mazza, an insurance salesman who lives in Neptune, N.J., flashed across the screen. In the two and a half minutes that follow, the couple, both 29, do a bicycle and walking tour of their courtship on the Jersey Shore, holding up hand-painted signs at landmarks: where they met, their first kiss and where Mr. Mazza proposed. 
''We decided to e-mail so that we wouldn't have to waste paper and printing rather than sending in the mail,'' Ms. Wentz said, explaining that a video conformed to their theme of being environmentally conscious.
Though a relatively recent addition to the traditional wedding checklist, the save-the-date announcement -- sent out even before the actual invitation and often in the form of a postcard or a refrigerator magnet -- has been reinvented by do-it-yourself, tech-savvy couples who are using Web sites like Etsy for design ideas and Vimeo for video-sharing to create a new wave of announcements.
Not only are online videography and mobile technology convenient and easily personalized, but save-the-date videos can also go viral, encouraging even more couples to mount their own miniature productions.
''People like things that they know are exclusively theirs,'' said Joe Minnella of Red Bank, N.J., the videographer for Ms. Wentz and Mr. Mazza. ''No two videos will ever be exactly the same, and with video the possibilities are endless. Clients also get a chance to take part in the creative process and essentially be the stars of their own music video.''
Visual announcements can incorporate everything from digital collages to mock movie trailers and even touches of film noir.
FOR the majority of couples who still prefer to send something in the mail, they can now riff on the postcard or magnet with scratch-offs or announcements that take the form of a boarding pass or a bookmark.
''I think people realize that while communicating by e-mail is great for smaller parties,'' said Karen Bussen, an event planner in New York, ''a wedding is a truly special occasion that deserves to be marked with an actual piece of mail. After all, when the wedding is over, if you send an e-mail save-the-date, what will you put in your scrapbook?''
Graphic designers like Kari O'Brien, a designer and photo editor at CLB Photography in Red Bank, sees the same trend.
''I think it's becoming more of an artistic aspect of a wedding as opposed to a piece of stationery that's going to end up in the drawer,'' she said.
For the save-the-date announcement for her own wedding last March, Mrs. O'Brien, 31, created an album cover reminiscent of Michael Jackson's ''Bad'' on 5-by-5-inch cardstock. She included pictures from her rock 'n' roll-themed engagement photo session -- at a self-storage facility in Shrewsbury, N.J. Instead of songs, the back of the album listed significant dates: ''The Day We Met,'' ''We're Engaged'' and finally ''Save the Date.''
Seeking an alternative to a postcard or ordinary magnet, Shauntelle Brown and James Robinson, who now live in Canton, Ga., chose a puzzle magnet to announce their wedding, which took place last August. Mrs. Robinson, 30, is a housewife, and Mr. Robinson, 28, works as a finance specialist.
Using one of the pictures from their engagement photo session in downtown Philadelphia, Yvette Sencion, the owner of SDezigns of Toms River, N.J., created the nine-piece puzzle, fusing their wedding colors of purple and pewter. The couple outsourced the design to PromotionalBest.com, a company in China, to assemble the puzzle magnet.
Although more couples are resorting to out-of-the-box or off-the-refrigerator thinking with their save-the-date announcements, industry experts say that most still rely on traditional postcards and magnets.
''For brides with a budget, the traditional method is more economical,'' said Pam Kraus, the director of invitations and gifts for the David's Bridal chain. While $45 for 100 cards covers traditional save-the-dates in thermograph and raised print at David's Bridal, the price range for music videos directed by Mr. Minnella runs from $600 to $1,000.
Christina Gafford and Tony Murray of Chadds Ford, Pa., sent 70 bookmarks in June for their wedding this March.
Ms. Gafford, 29, a lawyer, and Mr. Murray, 30, a credit analyst, found, through Etsy, Margo Snyder, a graphic designer in Silver Lake, Ohio, who now owns Best Day Design, to create a bookmark that was loosely based on a sketch by Ms. Gafford.
The couple said they chose a bookmark partly because of its utility and partly in tribute to their book discussion club.
Over a month, the couple, with the help of Ms. Gafford's aunt Ann Mantegna, formed a small assembly line -- transferring the bookmark design and printing it on ivory linen paper, cutting out the bookmarks, punching holes, threading wine-colored tassels through them, and packaging the bookmarks in thin ivory linen paper and then into envelopes.
''I've been a lot into do-it-yourself projects for the wedding because I have a vision in my mind,'' Ms. Gafford said. ''It's hard to find exactly what I want. I find I'm the one who can execute my vision the best.''

HEADLINE: I.T. Guy To The Revolution

BYLINE: By ANDREW GOLDMAN

 BODY:
As a Dubai-based Google executive, you created a Facebook page that helped foment the Egyptian uprising. Your memoir, ''Revolution 2.0,'' recounts how you spent 11 days imprisoned during some of the most dramatic Tahrir Square protests. Major letdown, I imagine. It's not a matter of enjoying the process as much as looking forward to the result, which is actually why most of the people went down to the streets. When I was released on Feb. 7, I saw Egyptians had managed to stand up together. I felt like I had been jailed for 11 years, but I did not feel I really missed the whole thing.
As there was no clear alternative to Mubarak, was it unwise to encourage revolution? I'm fully aware of a lot of opinions that this was a very big downside of the revolution -- that it had no leadership to take over after Mubarak stepped down. Only history will judge. Regardless, a lot of Egyptians are now empowered. 
Americans applaud democracy, but we're also wary to see how parties like the Muslim Brotherhood benefit from the void. For over 30 years, the regime was oppressing us by basically telling the international community that if there is real democracy, the Muslim Brotherhood will come to power. I don't oppose anyone who's democratically elected. What matters is the economy: improving the life of over 40 percent of Egyptians who are living below $2 a day.
Economic issues were a big driver of the revolution. Considering that Egypt's crucial tourism business has nosedived, are things really better now? When Mubarak stepped down, there were high expectations that came from a very simple view: He and his people were the problem and, once you remove them, the problem is solved. Which is definitely not the way things have developed. The euphoria is over. The country was governed in such a way that 0.1 percent was making decisions for the rest of the people. So there is a lack of understanding about the size of the economic problems we're facing.
Much of your rhetoric about self-determination echoes what George Bush said about Iraq. The Iraq war was deeply unpopular in Egypt, but do you feel differently now that Iraq is free? Not at all. The war in Iraq killed so many innocent people, and it's not something that any civilized nation should be proud of. People who live in a country are the ones to decide their destiny because they are the ones who eventually pay the price for whatever choices they make.
What about Syria? President Assad's forces have killed more than 4,000 people for trying to do what you did in Egypt. I support the Syrian revolution. But the international community, not just the U.S., should have a role. And it must avoid any aggressive action that would put more people at risk.
Bush was very unpopular in Egypt. Does the country see Obama differently? A lot of people were optimistic when Obama came and addressed the Muslim nation in Egypt. But there was no significant change in foreign policy after that. It's hard to change perception with just talk.
According to the United Nations, the prevalence of female circumcision among married Egyptian women aged 15 to 49 is 91 percent. What do you think of this? I question the number. I'm not really aware enough of the topic to comment. I think there is a religious debate around it, but I haven't really read enough to make a judgment call.
Before the revolution, you worked at Google all day and on your Facebook page all night. You have an American wife and two young children. How did you get away with that schedule? We had our ups and downs, but overall she was very understanding. She really understands me and knows when issues are very serious.
You write that the reason you sought an American bride was that you'd had little luck with Egyptian women. Considering that you've become something of an Egyptian Che Guevara, I imagine you're now considered a heartthrob. Not really. The Western media like to put me up as the face of the revolution, but I don't feel that way. Some people appreciate what I have done, but the revolution was literally without a leader. Anyway, I'm happily married.

HEADLINE: It's Still the 'Age of Anxiety.' Or Is It?

BYLINE: By DANIEL SMITH. 
The author of the forthcoming ''Monkey Mind: A Memoir of Anxiety.'' He blogs at Monkey Mind Chronicles.

 BODY:
It's hard to believe that anyone but scholars of modern literature or paid critics have read W. H. Auden's dramatic poem ''The Age of Anxiety'' all the way through, even though it won a Pulitzer Prize in 1948, the year after it was published. It is a difficult work -- allusive, allegorical, at times surreal. But more to the point, it's boring. The characters meet, drink, talk and walk around; then they drink, talk and walk around some more. They do this for 138 pages; then they go home.
Auden's title, though: that people know. From the moment it appeared, the phrase has been used to characterize the consciousness of our era, the awareness of everything perilous about the modern world: the degradation of the environment, nuclear energy, religious fundamentalism, threats to privacy and the family, drugs, pornography, violence, terrorism. Since 1990, it has appeared in the title or subtitle of at least two dozen books on subjects ranging from science to politics to parenting to sex (''Mindblowing Sex in the Real World: Hot Tips for Doing It in the Age of Anxiety''). As a sticker on the bumper of the Western world, ''the age of anxiety'' has been ubiquitous for more than six decades now. 
But is it accurate? As someone who has struggled with chronic anxiety for many years, I have my doubts. For one thing, when you've endured anxiety's insults for long enough -- the gnawed fingernails and sweat-drenched underarms, the hyperventilating and crippling panic attacks -- calling the 20th century ''The Age of Anxiety'' starts to sound like calling the 17th ''The Age of the Throbbing Migraine'': so metaphorical as to be meaningless.
From a sufferer's perspective, anxiety is always and absolutely personal. It is an experience: a coloration in the way one thinks, feels and acts. It is a petty monster able to work such humdrum tricks as paralyzing you over your salad, convincing you that a choice between blue cheese and vinaigrette is as dire as that between life and death. When you are on intimate terms with something so monumentally subjective, it is hard to think in terms of epochs.
And yet it is undeniable that ours is an age in which an enormous and growing number of people suffer from anxiety. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety disorders now affect 18 percent of the adult population of the United States, or about 40 million people. By comparison, mood disorders -- depression and bipolar illness, primarily -- affect 9.5 percent. That makes anxiety the most common psychiatric complaint by a wide margin, and one for which we are increasingly well-medicated. Last spring, the drug research firm IMS Health released its annual report on pharmaceutical use in the United States. The anti-anxiety drug alprazolam -- better known by its brand name, Xanax -- clocked in at 46.3 million prescriptions in 2010. No other psychiatric drug even made it into the top 25.
Just because our anxiety is heavily diagnosed and medicated, however, doesn't mean that we are more anxious than our forebears. It might simply mean that we are better treated -- that we are, as individuals and a culture, more cognizant of the mind's tendency to spin out of control.
Earlier eras might have been even more jittery than ours. Fourteenth-century Europe, for example, experienced devastating famines, waves of pillaging mercenaries, peasant revolts, religious turmoil and a plague that wiped out as much as half the population in four years. The evidence suggests that all this resulted in mass convulsions of anxiety, a period of psychic torment in which, as one historian has put it, ''the more one knew, the less sense the world made.'' Nor did the monolithic presence of the Church necessarily help; it might even have made things worse. A firm belief in God and heaven was near-universal, but so was a firm belief in their opposites: the Devil and hell. And you could never be certain in which direction you were headed.
It's hard to imagine that we have it even close to as bad as that. Yet there is an aspect of anxiety that we clearly have more of than ever before: self-awareness. The inhabitants of earlier eras might have been wracked by nerves, but none fixated like we do on the condition. Indeed, none even considered anxiety a condition. Anxiety didn't emerge as a cohesive psychiatric concept until the early 20th century, when Freud highlighted it as ''the nodal point at which the most various and important questions converge, a riddle whose solution would be bound to throw a flood of light upon our whole mental existence.''
After that, the number of thinkers and artists who sought to solve this riddle increased exponentially. By 1977, the psychoanalyst Rollo May was noting an explosion in papers, books and studies on the subject. ''Anxiety,'' he wrote, ''has certainly come out of the dimness of the professional office into the bright light of the marketplace.''
None of this is to say that ours is a serene age. Obviously it isn't. It is to say, however, that we shouldn't be possessive about our uncertainties, particularly as one of the dominant features of anxiety is its recursiveness. Anxiety begins with a single worry, and the more you concentrate on that worry, the more powerful it gets, and the more you worry. One of the best things you can do is learn to let go: to disempower the worry altogether. If you start to believe that anxiety is a foregone conclusion -- if you start to believe the hype about the times we live in -- then you risk surrendering the battle before it's begun.
This is the first article in Anxiety, a new series at nytimes.com/opinionator.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 22, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An opinion essay on Jan. 15 about the prevalence of anxiety disorders erroneously attributed a distinction to the anti-anxiety drug alprazolam, or Xanax. It was the only psychiatric medication among the top 15 -- not the top 25 -- prescription drugs in the United States in 2010. A subheading accompanying the article also referred incorrectly to Xanax prescriptions. The medication was prescribed 46.3 million times in the United States in 2010, as the article correctly noted -- not to 46 million people.

HEADLINE: Big-Dollar Estimates at Scottsdale

BYLINE: By ROB SASS

 BODY:
FOR several years, the collector car market has had a split personality. Great blue-chip cars have found eager bidders paying record prices at auction, while cars a notch below have often gone wanting. The gulf in dollars separating the best and the rest has continued to widen.
Simultaneously, there is a gulf between the results of the two leading auction weeks, at Pebble Beach in California in August and around Scottsdale, Ariz., in January. They used to be roughly equivalent in dollar volume, with Scottsdale, on the strength of Barrett-Jackson in its $100 million heyday, sometimes even surpassing the more tony Pebble Beach. In the last several years, though, the rarest and most expensive merchandise has generally crossed the block in Pebble Beach. 
This doesn't mean, however, that Scottsdale -- where sales begin in earnest this week -- is where collectors go to dispose of their B-list cars. As the site of the first major events of a new year, the Arizona auctions are often the barometer of the market. And because the top of the market seems to need no barometer at the moment (the nearly $200 million in sales last August in Pebble Beach silenced the pessimists), most inquiring eyes will be on the midrange and entry-level cars where the vitality at the top of the market seems to be trickling down, as evidenced by the uniformly ambitious presale estimates in the Arizona auction catalogs.
RM Auctions, Gooding & Company and Bonhams publish catalogs with presale estimates. Russo & Steele, Barrett-Jackson and Silver do not. Here are a few entry and mid-level cars with particularly strong estimates:
1964 PORSCHE 356SC SUNROOF COUPE Porsche fans often cite the last of the 356 line in coupe form with a sunroof as one of the cars they'd like to own and drive on a regular basis. This one at Bonhams appears to be from California with the rare and desirable sunroof option and higher horsepower engine in the sought-after colors of red and black. Still, its estimate of $100,000-$120,000 seems stiff. This was Speedster money not that many years ago.
1965 SHELBY GT350 FASTBACK The 1965 Shelby GT350 is the purest and most performance-oriented of the Mustangs modified by Carroll Shelby. Not as one-dimensional as other 1960s pony cars, GT350s could brake and handle credibly as well as go fast in a straight line. Before the economic meltdown, these were bumping $300,000, but soon fell to about $150,000. The estimate of $225,000-$275,000 at RM is close to top of the market.
1967 CHEVROLET CORVETTE STING RAY ROADSTER Big-block Corvette Sting Rays that still have their original matching-numbers engines are rare, given the propensity of their original owners to blow them up on the drag strip. This particular car, offered by RM, was restored by a Long Island Corvette expert, Kevin Mackay, and looks to be authentic, as its many awards attest. At the height of the Corvette market in late 2007, great 427/435 convertibles were selling for nearly $200,000. The consigner is looking for the brass ring here with an estimate of $225,000-$300,000, which given the obvious quality, doesn't seem nutty.
1967 CADILLAC ELDORADO This was a ground-breaking front-wheel-drive car from General Motors, released a year after the equally stunning 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado. The Eldorado, which many market observers have considered undervalued for as long as anyone can remember, is a tour de force from the designer William Mitchell. This 18,000-mile example could well be the best one on the planet. If it is, its $40,000-$50,000 estimate from Gooding (easily double what '67 Eldos typically bring) might actually seem conservative.
1957 TRIUMPH TR3 The little, pop-eyed, bulldoglike TR3 was capable of dusting nearly any contemporary MG and could also give more expensive 6-cylinder Austin-Healeys a hard time. The Triumphs are rugged, charming and great fun, and they've always been solidly entry-level. This example, which Gooding says is largely unrestored, has a presale estimate of $45,000-$65,000, about double the usual selling prices.
The auctions start with Barrett-Jackson on Tuesday, Russo & Steele on Wednesday and Bonhams and RM on Thursday. The Gooding and Silver auctions start on Friday. Mecum is the only major company without an Arizona sale, but it will be busy getting ready for an auction of almost 2,000 cars the following week in Kissimmee, Fla.

HEADLINE: Unlocking the Secrets Behind Hydraulic Fracturing

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH. 
kgalbraith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Starting Feb. 1, drilling operators in Texas will have to report many of the chemicals used in the process known as hydraulic fracturing. Environmentalists and landowners are looking forward to learning what acids, hydroxides and other materials have gone into a given well. 
But a less-publicized part of the new regulation is what some experts are most interested in: the mandatory disclosure of the amount of water needed to ''frack'' each well. Experts call this an invaluable tool as they evaluate how fracking affects water supplies in the drought-prone state.
Hydraulic fracturing involves injecting water, sand and chemicals into underground shale formations at enormous pressure to extract oil and natural gas. Under the new rule, Texans will be able to check a Web site, fracfocus.org, to view the chemical and water disclosures.
''It's a huge step forward from where we were,'' Amy Hardberger, an Environmental Defense Fund lawyer, said of the rule.
Most fracked wells use 1 million to 5 million gallons of water over three to five days, said Justin Furnace, president of the Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association.
A June study prepared for the Texas Water Development Board suggested that less than 1 percent of the water used statewide went into fracking. Oil and natural gas groups say such numbers show their usage lags well behind that of cities.
But the data cited is a few years old, and drilling has since increased in places like the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. The amount of water used for fracking is ''expected to increase significantly through 2020,'' according to the state water plan published this month.
Dan Hardin, the water board's resource planning director, said water use for fracking was not expected to exceed 2 percent of the statewide total.
But drilling can send water use numbers much higher in rural areas, Dr. Hardin said. For example, he projects that in 2020, more than 40 percent of water demand in La Salle County, in the Eagle Ford Shale, will go toward ''mining,'' a technical term that in this case means almost entirely fracking. Until recently, no water went toward mining there.
Researchers say predicting future water usage for drilling is tough, citing economic and technological uncertainties. Meanwhile, they want more data.
Jean-Philippe Nicot, a research scientist with the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin and the main author of the water board's June study, noted that many drillers already reported water usage to the Texas Railroad Commission. (The commission's new rule will be the first time water disclosure is required.)
Dr. Nicot would like to see more information about whether the water comes from aquifers or reservoirs, or has been recycled from other fracking operations.
Texas also needs better information about what is in water that has been in the earth and comes up in a well in addition to oil or gas, said Mark A. Engle, a geologist with the United States Geological Survey's Eastern Energy Resources Science Center. That water can contain materials like grease and radioactive elements.
''Texas ranks pretty much dead last of any state I've worked with for keeping track of that sort of data,'' Dr. Engle said.

HEADLINE: Block by Block, The State of Things

 BODY:
Marijuana smoke and speeding traffic in Brownstone Brooklyn. The full restoration of a former crack house on Staten Island. A neighborhood-sustaining tamale vendor at a South Bronx subway stop. As a more granular supplement to the mayor's State of the City address, delivered on Thursday, The New York Times's City Room blog asked readers to share the state of their blocks.
Here are a few of more than 50 dispatches sent in from many corners of the city. For more, visit nytimes.com/cityroom. 
THE BLOCK Clifton Place, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn
THE STATE The block is magnificent, I have to say. My neighbor's five video cameras on the front of his 15-foot-wide building can attest to that. The streets are nicely paved, which makes it easy for cars to drive at maximum speed down the block trying to catch the light.
Since the weather has been warm, the old guys who hang out on the corner have stayed out there and appear to have multiplied!? The coffee shops are packed, as is the newish high-end bar-restaurant at the end of the block. New faces are moving onto the block every day, some with babies.
Fortunately, no one has tried to illegally gain access to our house from the back door this season. No more barking dogs; we gave ours back to the shelter. No more cats in our yard; those neighbors moved away. The wind still carries the (more than) occasional scent of cannabis down the block. All in all, I can't complain. PETE
THE BLOCK Austin Place between 144th and 147th Streets, Mott Haven, the Bronx
THE STATE Here on Austin Place we wake up to the sound of a rooster kept in a lot by a homeless alcoholic. There is surprisingly little crime but desolate at night. Graffiti artists tap their feet on the roofs, and in the morning one smells thick acrid fried chicken residue in the air.
There is the occasional illegal A.T.V. with teenage miscreant driving around. The police are available for parking tickets and not much else. The best food is from the Mexican woman by the subway who makes tamales. So far the city has not shut her down.
Still, our little block is an economic powerhouse with small businesses made from nothing employing folks and making things.
PATRICK ECK
THE BLOCK Beach 89th Street, Rockaway Beach, Queens
THE STATE Beach 89th Street is a mess of construction -- on the street, below the street and on the elevated tracks that abut the block. But the vibe is positive: residents are happy to see improvements to our infrastructure, and delighted that our newly refurbished A train station will be adorned with stunning stained-glass artwork. Feeling pretty positive about our evolving neighborhood. AKP
THE BLOCK Carlton and Flatbush Avenues, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn
THE STATE Rents are skyrocketing, crime is up, and the middle class is nonexistent. Store prices have nearly doubled in the last year, particularly for food. Most good stores closed, and chains took their place.
Ratner's stadium and luxury housing (don't believe any will end up ''affordable'') is causing $10 burger places to spring up, and his Atlantic mall is robbery central. Three people in my building lost their jobs. Weekly, cellphones snatched from hands by passing bikers. Bikers, emboldened, run red lights; bike holding coffee cups; bike with ear buds. Nice 2011, Bloomberg. Another few years of this and the BK will be unrecognizable.
BILL
THE BLOCK East 12th Street between First and Second Avenues, East Village
THE STATE Our block is full of thriving restaurants (old and new), a public school building, a bustling senior center (with a great view of the school's playground) and residences.
At the center of the block's south side, dividing the school's playground and a residential building, is an underused, fenced-off, triangular portion of the school's playground. Anonymous and illegal garbage is regularly dumped on the sidewalk exactly at this spot, validating the ongoing relevance of the broken-window theory. Not surprisingly, this same location was a hotbed of drug dealing in an earlier history of our block.
With hundreds of seniors visiting the center across the street daily, several local professional gardeners and two public schools housed in that building, this triangle is a perfect opportunity for N.Y.C. D.O.E., local businesses and residents to share in the stewardship and transformation of open space by creating and maintaining a garden for a public school that may not have PTA funding and support to do so.
DEBBY LEE COHEN
THE BLOCK Westervelt Avenue between Carroll Place and St. Marks Place, St. George, Staten Island
THE STATE Last year in this space, I wrote about a landmark 1872 French Second Empire crack house across the street from mine that had gone up in flames, only weeks before, as payback for a drug deal gone bad. The tenants, mostly addicts, scattered, and were never seen again.
This year, it's a whole different story. Because the fire-ravaged house is in the St. George Historic District, it couldn't be torn down; it couldn't be subjected to a cheapo rehab. The owner had to restore it, with guidance from the N.Y.C. Landmarks Preservation Commission. The restoration -- a gut rehab inside, a period restoration outside -- is now complete. They're just finishing up the landscaping this week. Passers-by who've not seen the house in a while do double-takes all the time.
Things on Westervelt Avenue are looking up.

HEADLINE: White House Takes Issue With 2 Antipiracy Bills

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT; Jenna Wortham contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration said Saturday that it strongly opposed central elements of two Congressional efforts to enforce copyrights on the Internet, all but killing the current versions of legislation that has divided both political parties and pitted Hollywood against Silicon Valley.
The comments by the administration's chief technology officials, posted on a White House blog Saturday, came as growing opposition to the legislation had already led sponsors of the bills to reconsider a measure that would force Internet service providers to block access to Web sites that offer or link to copyrighted material. 
''Let us be clear,'' the White House statement said, ''online piracy is a real problem that harms the American economy, threatens jobs for significant numbers of middle class workers and hurts some of our nation's most creative and innovative companies and entrepreneurs.''
However, it added, ''We will not support legislation that reduces freedom of expression, increases cybersecurity risk or undermines the dynamic, innovative global Internet.''
The bills currently under consideration in Congress were intended to combat the theft of copyrighted materials by preventing American search engines like Google and Yahoo from directing users to sites that allow for the distribution of stolen materials. They would cut off payment processors like PayPal that handle transactions.
The bills would also allow private citizens and companies to sue to stop what they believed to be theft of protected content. Those and other provisions set off fierce opposition among Internet companies, technology investors and free speech advocates, who said the bills would stifle online innovation, violate the First Amendment and even compromise national security by undermining the integrity of the Internet's naming system.
Though the Obama administration called for legislation this year that would give prosecutors and owners of intellectual property new abilities to deter overseas piracy, it also embraced the idea of ''voluntary measures and best practices'' to reduce piracy.
Whether Congress can produce a compromise is uncertain, particularly in the House of Representatives, where Republicans have fought bitterly over the antipiracy legislation and party leaders, who control the chamber, are loath to offer further opportunities for intraparty battles.
The Motion Picture Association of America, the Hollywood lobbying group that has been most visible in its support for the current bills, said in a statement on Saturday that it welcomed the administration's call for antipiracy legislation. But, the trade group added, ''meaningful legislation must include measured and reasonable remedies that include ad brokers, payment processors and search engines.''
Hollywood and the music industry have broad political support for their efforts, and the Chamber of Commerce and labor organizations have pushed for the legislation. But they often find themselves facing off against the libertarian views of leaders in the technology industry.
Opponents of the House bill, the Stop Online Piracy Act, and the Senate bill, the Protect IP Act, have focused most of their attention on the proposed blocking by Internet service providers of Web sites that offer access to pirated material.
In December, a group of influential technology figures, including founders of Twitter, Google and YouTube, published an open letter to lawmakers saying that the legislation would enable Internet regulation and censorship on par with the government regulation in China and Iran.
That argument struck a chord with the Obama administration, which through the State Department and other channels has been pushing other countries to loosen restrictions on Internet access.
In its statement Saturday, the White House said any proposed legislation ''must not tamper with the technical architecture of the Internet.'' Parts of the bills that provide for filtering or blocking through the Domain Name System -- the Internet's address book -- could drive users to unreliable routes through and around the blocked sites, the White House said. That would ''pose a real risk to cybersecurity and yet leave contraband goods and services accessible online.''
The statement did not threaten a presidential veto, but it made plain what types of piracy enforcement measures the White House would not accept.
The statement was attributed to Victoria Espinel, the intellectual property enforcement coordinator at the Office of Management and Budget; Aneesh Chopra, the administration's chief technology officer; and Howard Schmidt, a cybersecurity coordinator for the national security staff.

HEADLINE: Running From Millions

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
COLUMBIA, S.C.
FRESH from his triumph in New Hampshire, Mitt Romney bounded onto a stage here last week in a sport jacket, which was unusual for him, and an open collar and jeans, which are the norm. Casual dress is part of his financial camouflage. It doesn't scream $200 million man.
Voters aren't fooled. I checked with those assembled to hear his remarks, and even undecided ones who weren't fully familiar with him knew that he was rolling in it. They were also unsurprised by that.
''Isn't pretty much everybody who runs for president wealthy?'' said Wendy White, 49, a schoolteacher, making affluence in politics seem as foreordained as height in professional basketball -- which it almost is. ''In an ideal, utopian society, we'd like someone who knows what it's like to struggle as a teacher or a working mom. But Republican or Democrat, they always have money if they end up in the White House.'' 
And Republican or Democrat, they often go to laughable lengths to play that down. A recurring theme from just about every election cycle is the economic altitude of candidates who insist on playacting that they're less loftily removed from the so-called common man than they really are. Time and again we're treated to a comedy of manners with predictable pratfalls and a clear take-away: although there has long been a significant economic disparity between the rulers and the ruled, neither group can get entirely comfortable with it.
John McCain styled himself as a pomp-allergic enemy of big money in politics but hit a rough patch in 2008 when a reporter asked him how many homes he and his wife, Cindy, an heiress, owned. He had apparently lost count, because he couldn't come up with the answer: at least seven. According to some estimates, he was worth more than $36 million, not counting most of her fortune.
When John Kerry ran for president four years before that, he and Teresa Heinz Kerry, also an heiress, were worth about $750 million, according to numbers crunched by Forbes. He emphasized that it was her money, not his, and that he had lived modestly in the past. He wasn't living modestly any longer. He and his wife reportedly divided their time between five homes worth more than $30 million in aggregate, including retreats in Idaho for skiing and on Nantucket for sailing.
Romney, whose net worth is generally estimated to be $200 million, earned his money rather than marrying into it. But the precise way he earned it -- through Bain Capital, a corporate-takeover firm -- has come under fierce attack in advance of the Jan. 21 primary in South Carolina, where some of Bain's deals are said to have cost jobs, and unemployment is 9.9 percent.
To make matters more fraught, he's campaigning during a time of exaggerated income inequality and increasingly loud complaints about it. A survey released by the Pew Research Center last week showed that 66 percent of Americans consider the conflict between the haves and have-nots to be ''very strong'' or ''strong.'' In 2009, only 47 percent of respondents said that.
Romney's adjustment to that is a work in awkward progress. Last June, he told Florida voters that as a candidate, he, too, was essentially unemployed. He was kidding, but still.
He wasn't kidding last week when he told New Hampshire voters that he had begun his career ''at the entry level,'' as if the Harvard-educated son of a former governor and corporate chieftain grabs hold of the same first rung that others do. And he assured them that he had known the fear of ''a pink slip.'' They probably thought he was talking about lingerie.
He's almost uniquely clumsy with quips that draw inadvertent attention to his affluence. Bet you $10,000 you can't name someone clumsier.
That's a wager most of his current Republican rivals can afford. According to a breakdown by ABC News, Jon Huntsman Jr.'s net worth has been estimated to be about $50 million, while his father's is $900 million. Newt Gingrich's is close to $7 million, Rick Perry's about $3 million, Ron Paul's between $1.9 and $5.2 million and Rick Santorum's as much as $2 million, though in all cases it's hard to be sure or specific. Candidates file dollar ranges rather than exact figures to the Federal Election Commission, and only some elect to make their tax returns public.
The Republican field is no historic anomaly. Some of our richest presidents were our earliest ones. When The Atlantic two years ago researched presidents' wealth and adjusted their estimated net worth to 2010 dollars, it found that eight of the first 10 presidents were worth at least $20 million, and five of those men were worth more than $50 million, at least by the time they left office. George Washington led the pack, with $525 million, much of it courtesy of Martha, a widowed heiress.
In the second half of the 19th century, there was a stretch of presidents of humbler means, including Abraham Lincoln. But almost all 20th-century presidents were much richer than the average American.
Barack Obama didn't grow up well-off and remained relatively poor by presidential standards, but he and his wife reported a gross income of nearly $1 million in 2006 and had assets of between $2 million and $7.35 million by the end of 2007, when his presidential bid was under way. By then the Clintons were rich enough that Hillary, challenging Obama for the Democratic nomination, was able to lend her campaign $11 million of her own money.
The tens of millions it can take for a credible presidential primary campaign favors candidates with money, if only because they have the ability to abandon salaried jobs and stump. When Mike Huckabee begged off the 2012 presidential race, a lack of accrued wealth was one reason.
''If I run, I walk away from a pretty good income,'' he said, referring to his daily radio and weekly TV shows.
MORE important, candidates of means tend to have access to the sorts of rich people who can pump major money into super PACs. The principal one supporting Romney had already raised $12 million by last July.
Even many Congressional campaigns have grown drawn out and exorbitant. Is it any wonder, then, that Congress has become a wealthier club? As Eric Lichtblau reported in The Times recently, the median net worth of a member of Congress appeared to be $913,000 in 2010 and had grown 15 percent over six years. The median net worth for all Americans was about $100,000 and had declined 8 percent.
There's no simple relationship between privilege and policy. The Roosevelts and Kennedys, both spectacularly rich families, produced leaders known for their populism and protection of the less fortunate. Nancy Pelosi, a staunch defender of government aid, is thought to be worth as much as $196 million. John Boehner? Just $1.8 million, according to figures from 2010.
Wealth in politics makes a certain sense. The same drive, vanity, accomplishment and ingenuity that fuel a successful political career often fuel high earnings beforehand. And those earnings in some instances win voters' confidence.
Paul Friedman, 32, an undecided voter who showed up at Romney's event in Columbia, said, ''If we're talking about jobs, and his businesses are successful, then maybe he'd run the country in a way that brings jobs back.'' That's Romney's pitch.
But he walks a tightrope, wanting to broadcast his success without seeming out of touch. A wealthy candidate's aides guard against tone-deaf admissions of privilege while opponents itch to pounce, as the first President Bush's did in 1992, when he seemed unfamiliar with a grocery store's electronic price scanner.
I doubt many politicians at that stage of the game are spending much time in the checkout line or know the price of milk without seeing it on a briefing paper. But the charade persists. The second President Bush learned from his father's mistakes and seemed to develop an entire folksy persona in response. He spent vacations clearing brush, and though done on a vast Texas ranch purchased with his considerable wealth, it yielded optics preferable to those of John Kerry windsurfing.
Romney recalls the Naugahyde chair in an office past and tweets about breakfast at Subway and a flight on Southwest Airlines. But inevitably he muffs the script. During last Sunday's debate he said a man shouldn't run for office if he needed to win to pay the mortgage.
It wasn't a $10,000 flub. But it was rich.

HEADLINE: What They Don't Want to Talk About

 BODY:
Ever since Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry started criticizing Mitt Romney's actions at Bain Capital -- and talking about the thousands of people laid off as a result of Bain's investments -- party leaders have essentially told them to shut up. That response is a pretty good indication of how deeply party elders fear the issue of economic inequality in the campaign to come.
''What the hell are you doing, Newt?'' Rudolph Giuliani asked Thursday on Fox News. ''This is what Saul Alinsky taught Barack Obama, and what you're saying is part of the reason we're in so much trouble right now.'' 
Mr. Giuliani has one thing right: Republicans are indeed in growing trouble as more voters begin to realize how much the party's policies -- dismantling regulations, slashing taxes for the rich, weakening unions -- have contributed to inequality and the yawning distance between the middle class and the top end.
The more President Obama talks about narrowing that gap, the more his popularity ratings have risen while those of Congress plummet. Two-thirds of Americans now say there is a strong conflict between the rich and the poor, according to a Pew survey released last week, making it the greatest source of tension in American society.
That makes Mr. Romney and his party vulnerable, as he clearly knows. He said on Wednesday that issues of wealth distribution should be discussed only ''in quiet rooms.'' And he accused the president of using an ''envy-oriented, attack-oriented'' approach, ''entirely inconsistent with the concept of one nation under God.''
Mr. Romney's image of a country where workers have nothing but admiration for benevolent, job-creating capitalists (and no one is so impolite as to mention jobs destroyed) bears very little relationship to reality. But his suggestion that it is un-American to talk about rising populist resentment is self-serving and hypocritical. Republicans, in particular, have eagerly stoked such resentments against minorities and the poor.
That was the essence of the ''Southern strategy'' that Republicans, beginning with Richard Nixon, used to urge white voters to defect from a Democratic Party that supported civil rights. It continued for decades with attacks on busing, affirmative action, immigration and welfare, and was sounded most recently by Mr. Gingrich, with his attacks on Mr. Obama as ''the food stamp president.''
Fanning resentment of the poor -- and deflecting attention from the relentless Republican defense of the rich -- is also central to the party's current political strategy. That's why so many Republican candidates and lawmakers keep talking so angrily about poor people not paying federal income taxes. That's how the Tea Party got started in 2009, when Mr. Obama proposed lowering interest rates for homeowners who were behind on their mortgages and conservative activists saw an opportunity to pit the affluent against their struggling neighbors. And that's why Mr. Romney constantly accuses the president of trying to create ''an entitlement society,'' which is simply a variant on Ronald Reagan's welfare-queen anecdotes.
And yet if Democrats dare to point out that the income gains of the top 1 percent have dwarfed everyone else's in the last few decades, they are accused of whipping up class envy. Alan Krueger, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, noted in a speech on Thursday that the median income in the United States had actually declined since 1999, shrinking the middle class while the income of the top 1 percent soared. Such inequality is corrosive. And pointing it out has nothing to do with envy and everything to do with pressing for policies to help America's struggling middle class.
Anyone who criticizes Mr. Romney's business practices now faces the absurd charge of putting free-market capitalism on trial. No one is trying to end capitalism, but President Obama is calling for more effective regulation to protect consumers. While Republicans attack a supposed ''entitlement culture,'' Mr. Obama is calling for strengthening a desperately needed safety net. And he is calling for raising taxes on the wealthy, particularly for those on Wall Street and in private equity, to protect that safety net and reduce the deficit.
Mr. Romney has based his campaign on his business experience. Americans need to know how that experience was gained, and what values -- if any -- it represents. Class reality has nothing to do with class warfare.

HEADLINE: What's Race Got to Do With It?

BYLINE: By LEE SIEGEL. 
The author, most recently, of ''Harvard Is Burning.''

 BODY:
MITT ROMNEY may not have officially clinched the Republican nomination, but his victory has never really been in doubt. Nor has his viability in November: the most fanatical Tea Partiers are not about to withhold their votes and risk allowing President Obama to be re-elected.
Pundits have already begun the endless debate over whether Mr. Romney's wealth and religion are hindrances or assets. But there has yet to be any discussion over the one quality that has subtly fueled his candidacy thus far and could well put him over the top in the fall: his race. The simple, impolitely stated fact is that Mitt Romney is the whitest white man to run for president in recent memory. 
Of course, I'm not talking about a strict count of melanin density. I'm referring to the countless subtle and not-so-subtle ways he telegraphs to a certain type of voter that he is the cultural alternative to America's first black president. It is a whiteness grounded in a retro vision of the country, one of white picket fences and stay-at-home moms and fathers unashamed of working hard for corporate America.
In this way, Mr. Romney's Mormonism may end up being a critical advantage. Evangelicals might wring their hands over the prospect of a Mormon president, but there is no stronger bastion of pre-civil-rights-America whiteness than the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Yes, since 1978 the church has allowed blacks to become priests. But Mormonism is still imagined by its adherents as a religion founded by whites, for whites, rooted in a millenarian vision of an America destined to fulfill a white God's plans for earth.
It's true that Mr. Romney's opponents are all white as well. But each is tainted in his own way. Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich appear soft on Hispanic immigration, and Mr. Gingrich is hardly the standard-bearer for the invincible nuclear family.
Rick Santorum is an Italian-American Catholic, while Jon Huntsman, though a Mormon himself, wears his cosmopolitanism too brazenly. (Does he really think it's an asset, in the eyes of a Republican primary voter, to speak Mandarin?) And Ron Paul's isolationist conspiracy-mongering recalls, if anything, the radical-right fringe of the '50s and '60s, of the John Birchers and the followers of George Wallace, a manic moment even most evangelicals would rather forget.
Contrast that with Mr. Romney's meticulously cultivated whiteness. He is nearly always in immaculate white shirt sleeves. He is implacably polite, tossing off phrases like ''oh gosh'' with Stepford bonhomie. He has mastered Benjamin Franklin's honesty as the ''best policy'': a practiced insincerity, an instant sunniness that, though evidently inauthentic, provides a bland bass note that keeps everyone calm. This is the bygone world of Babbitt, of small-town Rotarians.
Mr. Romney does not merely use the past as an inspirational reference point, as the other candidates often do. He conjures it as a total social, cultural and political experience that must be resurrected and reinhabited. He speaks of the founding fathers and the Declaration of Independence as phases of national creativity that we are destined to live through again. He frequently accompanies his recitative with verses from ''America the Beautiful.''
And while Mr. Romney may, in some people's eyes, be a non-Christian, he is better than any of his opponents at synching his worldview with that of the evangelicals. He likes to present, with theological urgency, a stark choice between, in his words, President Obama's ''entitlement society'' and the true American freedom of an ''opportunity society.'' By the time he intones the Puritans' alabaster ideal of America as a ''shining city on a hill,'' you wonder if he is not also asking us to choose between two different types of mountaintops.
In this way, whether he means to or not, Mr. Romney connects with a central evangelic fantasy: that the Barack Obama years, far from being the way forward, are in fact a historical aberration, a tear in the white space-time continuum. And let's be clear: Mr. Obama's election was not destiny, but a fluke.
Despite a general revulsion against George W. Bush and his policies, despite John McCain's lack of ideas and his remoteness from contemporary American problems, the Republican ticket was ahead of Mr. Obama by several points in September 2008. Then came the fall: Lehman Brothers, the stock-market plunge and skyrocketing unemployment (not to mention Sarah Palin).
By the iron law of elections, the country threw the bums out and rejected anyone even remotely tied to them. The result? America's first black president.
And yet, as became immediately apparent in 2009, millions of Americans were unwilling to accept the basic democratic premise that Mr. Obama legally and morally deserved to sit in the White House -- and that was before they confronted his ''socialist'' and ''un-American'' policy agenda.
Mitt Romney knows this. He knows that he offers to these people the white solution to the problem of a black president. I am sure that Mr. Romney is not a racist. But I am also sure that, for the many Americans who find the thought of a black president unbearable, he is an ideal candidate. For these sudden outsiders, Mitt Romney is the conventional man with the outsider faith -- an apocalyptic pragmatist -- who will wrest the country back from the unconventional man with the intolerable outsider color.

HEADLINE: Why Is Europe a Dirty Word?

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
PARIS
QUELLE horreur! One of the uglier revelations about President Obama emerging from the Republican primaries is that he is trying to turn the United States into Europe.
''He wants us to turn into a European-style welfare state,'' warned Mitt Romney. Countless versions of that horrific vision creep into Romney's speeches, suggesting that it would ''poison the very spirit of America.''
Rick Santorum agrees, fretting that Obama is ''trying to impose some sort of European socialism on the United States.'' 
Who knew? Our president is plotting to turn us into Europeans. Imagine:
It's a languid morning in Peoria, as a husband and wife are having breakfast. ''You're sure you don't want eggs and bacon?'' the wife asks. ''Oh, no, I prefer these croissants,'' the husband replies. ''They have a lovely je ne sais quoi.''
He dips the croissant into his cafe au-lait and chews it with zest. ''What do you want to do this evening?'' he asks. ''Now that we're only working 35 hours a week, we have so much more time. You want to go to the new Bond film?''
''I'd rather go to a subtitled art film,'' she suggests. ''Or watch a pretentious intellectual television show.''
''I hear Kim Kardashian is launching a reality TV show where she discusses philosophy and global politics with Bernard-Henri Levy,'' he muses. ''Oh, cherie, that reminds me, let's take advantage of the new petanque channel and host a super-boules party.''
''Parfait! And we must work out our vacation, now that we can take all of August off. Instead of a weekend watching ultimate fighting in Vegas, let's go on a monthlong wine country tour.''
''How romantic!'' he exclaims. ''I used to worry about getting sick on the road. But now that we have universal health care, no problem!''
Look out: another term of Obama, and we'll all greet each other with double pecks on the cheek.
Yet there is something serious going on. The Republican candidates unleash these attacks on Obama because so many Americans have in mind a caricature of Europe as an effete, failed socialist system. As Romney puts it: ''Europe isn't working in Europe. It's not going to work here.''
(Monsieur Romney is getting his comeuppance. Newt Gingrich has released an attack ad, called ''The French Connection,'' showing clips of Romney speaking the language of Paris. The scandalized narrator warns: ''Just like John Kerry, he speaks French!'')
But the basic notion of Europe as a failure is a dangerous misconception. The reality is far more complicated.
What is true is that Europe is in an economic mess. Quite aside from the current economic crisis, labor laws are often too rigid, and the effect has been to make companies reluctant to hire in the first place. Unemployment rates therefore are stubbornly high, especially for the young. And Europe's welfare state has been too generous, creating long-term budget problems as baby boomers retire.
''The dirty little secret of European governments was that we lived in a way we couldn't afford,'' Sylvie Kauffmann, the editorial director of the newspaper Le Monde, told me. ''We lived beyond our means. We can't live this lie anymore.''
Yet Kauffmann also notes that Europeans aren't questioning the basic European model of safety nets, and are aghast that Americans tolerate the way bad luck sometimes leaves families homeless.
It's absurd to dismiss Europe. After all, Norway is richer per capita than the United States. Moreover, according to figures from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, per-capita G.N.P. in France was 64 percent of the American figure in 1960. That rose to 73 percent by 2010. Zut alors! The socialists gained on us!
Meanwhile, they did it without breaking a sweat. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that employed Americans averaged 1,741 hours at work in 2010. In France, the figure was 1,439 hours.
If Europe was as anticapitalist as Americans assume, its companies would be collapsing. But there are 172 European corporations among the Fortune Global 500, compared with just 133 from the United States.
Europe gets some important things right. It has addressed energy issues and climate change far more seriously than America has. It now has more economic mobility than the United States, partly because of strong public education systems. America used to have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world; now France and Britain are both ahead of us.
Back in 1960, French life expectancy was just a few months longer than in the United States, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. By 2009, the French were living almost three years longer than we were.
So it is worth acknowledging Europe's labor rigidities and its lethargy in resolving the current economic crisis. Its problems are real. But embracing a caricature of Europe as a failure reveals our own ignorance -- and chauvinism.

HEADLINE: Boehner Faces a Restive G.O.P. And New White House Attacks

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For Speaker John A. Boehner and House Republicans, returning to the Capitol this week could have the awkward feeling of a couple waking up after a night of fighting.
Mr. Boehner began 2011 with the heady wave of victory and ended the year in disarray when the Senate forced him and his members to accept a short-term extension of the payroll tax cut. Now, he begins the second session of the 112th Congress on defense, his leadership under scrutiny and his party facing an election-year attack from the White House.
His challenge is not only to rein in his restive conference but also to preserve his party's majority even as he fends off President Obama, who is making Congress his central opponent in his re-election bid. And rank-and-file Republicans are itching for accomplishments, like reducing regulations and changing the tax code, to sell in their districts.
''He needs to be clear in what our strategy is,'' said Representative Marlin Stutzman, a freshman Republican from Indiana. ''I got chewed out by folks who said, 'Why did you fold?' I got scolded back home, and I don't really like it. 
''Leadership has to make decisions sometimes,'' he added, ''but we could at least be on the same page.''
The tensions among Republican lawmakers reflect the central problem that Mr. Boehner faced through several rounds of negotiations over federal spending last year. In his attempts to strike the kinds of bipartisan deals that voters say they crave, the speaker often gets ahead of his conservative membership and is then forced to retreat when he finds support lacking.
Mr. Boehner's travails, which many Republicans and Democrats view as stemming from a fundamental misreading of what he can extract from his conference, have hurt his credibility both in his own ranks and with Congressional Democrats and the White House.
''I wish I could say it will be better in terms of more bipartisanship,'' said Representative Michael G. Grimm, Republican of New York. ''But I don't think it will.''
Mr. Boehner, however, said he was confident that he had full control over his members.
''You know, I grew up in a big family and had my share of frustration trying to come to decisions within the family,'' Mr. Boehner said in an interview in his Capitol Hill office. ''And, my goodness, there are 242 of us in this family. You're going to have divergent opinions.''
''Some people want to do more things, and they want to do them faster,'' he added. ''Others think we ought to take a more reasoned approach. My job is to listen to my members to make a decision about how we move forward, get everybody on the same page and go. It's not easy.''
Asked if he sometimes wanted to shake members who would not listen to his appeals, Mr. Boehner laughed as he blew a curl of smoke and said, ''Yes.''
Mr. Boehner's problems on the Hill reflect the divisions within the Republican Party, with the most right-leaning faction's quest for ideological purity chafing against a desire among some members, including Mr. Boehner, to compromise in the name of legislative accomplishment.
''With a 25-seat majority,'' said Representative Aaron Schock, Republican of Illinois, ''you need to be together in order to govern. With so many new members comes the challenge of getting everyone's expectations to be reasonable and having unified goals. I believe many members have more reasonable expectations now.''
The Republican presidential nominee, when he is selected, is certain to complicate matters further, adding another prominent voice to every policy battle.
In Mr. Boehner's favor this year is an absence of the kind of mandatory legislation, like a bill to finance the government or raise the debt ceiling, that caused so much chaos last year.
But still awaiting Congressional action are long-term extensions of the payroll tax holiday and unemployment benefits, which were abandoned in December over disagreements on how to pay for them, and a Federal Aviation Administration bill that got mired in a fight over labor unions. All of those debates raise the possibility of new clashes between the parties and within the Republican conference.
The bipartisan House and Senate conference committee assigned to deal with the payroll and unemployment benefit legislation could expedite and smooth the process, but Republican votes will be needed to pass any legislation it drafts.
''I am one of those conservatives who would have voted against the Senate bill and not voted to extend the payroll tax cuts at all,'' said Representative Dennis Ross of Florida, ''because that is the better policy.''
Republican leaders seem dedicated to a plan of letting members vent any lingering frustrations in the days before their party retreat in Baltimore this week, and then moving on to a new set of bills related to the economy.
In a memorandum to members, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the chairman of the House Republican Conference, said, ''We will devote our time in Baltimore to looking forward, discussing our goals for 2012, and designing a plan to achieve them.''
Republicans hope Mr. Obama's pronouncement that a full-year extension of the payroll tax cut was the last ''must-do'' piece of legislation for the White House will work in their favor, making them look as though they are trying to create jobs while Mr. Obama is busy campaigning.
''If I had the president's record,'' said Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, ''I'd be looking for a scapegoat, too. When he says Congress, I wonder if he is including the Senate, which is run by his own party.''
In the new session, Mr. Boehner said, ''we will have continued, relentless focus on getting our economy moving again and getting the American people back to work.'' High on the agenda is a bill to remove many regulations on American energy production, with projected new revenues from domestic production to be used to improve infrastructure.
Republicans will also continue to strongly support the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to Texas, which the White House is seeking to block.
''I want to wake up talking about Keystone pipeline and I want to go to bed at night talking about Keystone pipeline,'' said Representative Tim Griffin of Arkansas. ''Because it shows everything that is wrong with this administration and everything that is right about conservatives in Congress.''
In interviews, a dozen House Republicans said that although they remained angry about the way the last year ended, they were ready to support Mr. Boehner and move on. ''You will see a reinvigorated conference,'' said Representative Cory Gardner of Colorado. ''I don't think you win the American people by discussing the past.''
But it is clear that some members, many of whom have been steadfast in their opposition to Mr. Boehner's efforts for the politically possible, will continue to stir the pot. Representative Allen B. West of Florida told a radio host that the leadership had sold the party ''down the road.''
Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, who sits in a far more comfortable re-election position than many of his colleagues, took the fight to them, saying he was ''embarrassed by his fellow freshmen Republican lawmakers in D.C.,'' according to a report in Politico.
Mr. Mulvaney added, ''I would be embarrassed to tell you how many folks ran saying that they weren't going to spend a bunch of money, they weren't going to raise the debt ceiling, and then they went to Washington, D.C., and did exactly that.''
It is just that sort of infighting that many hope to avoid. ''There is an expectation that we work together,'' said Mr. Schock of Illinois. ''We will be struggling to find common ground.''

HEADLINE: Despite Uproar Over Clemency, Barbour Finds Lucrative Nest

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON; Eric Lichtblau contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
JACKSON, Miss. -- But who will pardon the governor?
Since former Gov. Haley Barbour granted clemency to 215 convicts in his last few days in office, among them more than two dozen who had been convicted of murder or manslaughter, he has found few unqualified supporters here in Mississippi.
The talk radio phone lines are full of disappointment, anger and mostly bewilderment. Democrats, who are usually in some form of retreat here, are demanding action. Republicans, who are in greater control of the state than at any other time since Reconstruction, have said the system is flawed. Only a hardy few are coming to the defense of Mr. Barbour, who is to Republican politics what fellow Mississippian Brett Favre was to football, down to the questionable endgame.
But on Wednesday, as the outcry was at its loudest, Mr. Barbour was in Miami already hard at work on his next professional act. He was giving a speech to an event organized by Barclays Bank, his first engagement of many as a star client of Leading Authorities, a prominent speakers' bureau. (''In his signature folksy and down-home style, Barbour addresses the 2012 political outlook and the upcoming election, Republican strategy, the economy, job creation and leadership,'' the company promises, listing him in the category of speakers costing between $30,000 and $50,000.) 
That same day, a prominent Jackson law firm, Butler Snow, announced that Mr. Barbour and his former chief of staff were joining the firm to work on government relations and business development, among other things.
That announcement was late compared with the one from the BGR Group, the Washington lobbying powerhouse that Mr. Barbour helped start in 1991. It publicized his return to the firm on Tuesday, the very day he left office.
Whatever is going on among the disconcerted Mississippi electorate, Mr. Barbour, 64, has been granted unconditional clemency by the world of high-powered lobbying, fund-raising and behind-the-scenes Republican strategy. It is a world that he mastered as White House political director and chairman of the Republican National Committee, that he traveled in part time as head of the Republican Governors Association, and that is now eagerly welcoming his political and policy savvy.
''Haley is so well respected in the party that he still remains a hugely powerful force,'' said Alex Castellanos, a prominent Republican strategist in Washington. ''He built the party that we have today from Reagan on, so there isn't a better fund-raiser, a better organizational leader in the Republican Party.''
Howard Marlowe, president of the American League of Lobbyists, an industry group in Washington, concurred. ''He's always been a person who carries a lot of weight in Republican politics, and that will continue,'' he said of Mr. Barbour. ''He'll be no more or less effective as a lobbyist than he was before, regardless of the pardon business.''
Less than a year ago, Mr. Barbour was on the presidential campaign trail, enlisting operatives in Florida and New Hampshire and having steak dinners with party activists in Iowa. With his connections, his fund-raising ability and his avowals of substantial weight loss -- avowals he made during past campaigns -- he appeared to be serious about a run for the White House.
But in April, after being battered by the news media about his comments on race relations in the 1960s, he suddenly dropped out. He was unconvinced, he said at the time, that he had the necessary ''fire in the belly'' to endure the relentlessness of the presidential politics.
''It was something that we talked about, it was real,'' said Jim Dyke, who was Mr. Barbour's communications adviser. ''He'd say, 'Jim, I've got to decide whether I'm really going to do this thing.' ''
That was his last overt flirtation with elected office. Mr. Barbour had already expressed his lack of interest in running for a Senate seat should Thad Cochran, Mississippi's senior senator, choose to retire in 2014; if he ran and won, Mr. Barbour would be entering the office at the age of 67, he pointed out.
In his exit interviews, Mr. Barbour repeatedly described his governorship as his last government job, and made sort-of jokes about wanting to make some real money after eight years in office. He is planning a book about his tenure during Hurricane Katrina and is envisioning a busy ride around the lecture circuit.
With ''2012 being a presidential election year, it's a very good year for political speakers,'' he said in a Jan. 4 interview on ''The Gallo Show,'' a conservative talk radio show in Mississippi.
Still, he is not finished with full-contact politics. Last year, Mr. Barbour joined American Crossroads, a ''super PAC'' formed by Karl Rove and other top Republican strategists to raise money for the 2012 election.
He has yet to commit to any candidate, which is partly a familial issue: one nephew works for the campaign of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, and another works for Mitt Romney's campaign.
Along with pop singers and professional athletes, politicians who talk of retirement from elected office are never completely taken seriously. Last week, however, Mr. Barbour seems to have not only shut the door to future electoral politics, but also painted over it.
''With the 200 pardons and 25-plus being for murder or manslaughter, that door's not open anymore,'' said Marty Wiseman, the director of the John C. Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State University.
Mr. Wiseman said he did not think the pardon controversy would undermine Mr. Barbour's legacy as governor -- a popular one for his aggressive courtship of industry to the state and his management of the Katrina aftermath. But in handing potential opposition researchers such an effortless task, Mr. Wiseman said, he ''emphatically drew a line under his career and said this is it as far as elected politics is concerned.''
Beginning with a short statement on Wednesday and continuing with interviews on Friday, Mr. Barbour has been openly defending the pardons, some of which have been temporarily blocked by a judge.
''Christianity teaches us forgiveness and second chances,'' Mr. Barbour said at a news conference here on Friday. ''I believe in second chances, and I try hard to be forgiving. The historic power of gubernatorial clemency by the governor to pardon felons is rooted in the Christian idea of giving second chances.''
He has repeatedly pointed out that 189 of the convicts were already out of prison and that half of the others were not getting full pardons but suspended sentences for medical reasons. It is too early to say whether this will change any minds; for now, even his supporters feel betrayed, or at least a bit let down.
''It's just going to take some time to get over this disappointment,'' said Paul Gallo, the host of ''The Gallo Show,'' who still thinks Mr. Barbour was a ''tremendous'' governor but doubts whether he could be elected after this. ''It's like beating up on an uncle that you like.''
From Washington, though, there is forgiveness and then some.
If anything, said Mr. Castellanos, the Republican strategist, the pardon controversy could help his image among Democrats if Mr. Barbour were to be nominated for a cabinet post in a Republican administration. Few Democrats would be likely to challenge a Barbour nomination, he said, on the grounds that the pardons showed him to be ''too humanitarian.''

HEADLINE: Advisers See an Upside in Criticism of Romney's Time at Bain Capital

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Ashley Parker contributed reporting from Hilton Head, S.C.

 BODY:
BEAUFORT, S.C. -- Mitt Romney has spent days defending himself against accusations that he was a job-killing vulture capitalist.
It is a line of attack that has delighted the White House, looking 10 months out to the general election.
But in the particular world of a South Carolina Republican primary, this criticism may turn out to be something of a gift for Mr. Romney. In a state that poses a crucial test of his ability to persuade religious, cultural and economic conservatives that he is truly one of them, he has so far been spared a piercing inquisition about his shifting positions over the years on abortion, gay rights and health care mandates -- somewhat to the frustration of his opponents. 
''I don't know why they continue to pound on it,'' said Rick Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, conceding in an interview here that he had grown frustrated with the focus on Mr. Romney's business dealings rather than his evolving views on social issues. ''We can't be distracted from finding a candidate who can draw a clear contrast on the big issues of the day.''
The debate over Mr. Romney's time buying and selling companies at Bain Capital, which touched off a fierce Republican defense of the merits of American capitalism, has rallied some influential conservative leaders to his side for the first time in the campaign.
The diversion has been a welcome distraction for Mr. Romney from other concerns that are still on the minds of some Republicans here in South Carolina ahead of its primary on Saturday.
At a crowded rally on Hilton Head Island, a woman rose to her feet on Friday evening and said: ''Do you believe in the divine saving grace of Jesus Christ?''
''Yes, I do,'' said Mr. Romney, a Mormon. ''I happen to believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God and my savior, but I know other people have differing views, and I respect those views and don't believe those qualify or disqualify people for leadership in our nation.''
The airwaves here have been dominated by criticism from Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker, who accused Mr. Romney of ''looting'' companies, and from Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who suggested that Mr. Romney engaged in ''vulture capitalism.'' His advisers believe that this criticism could help inoculate him against similar Democratic-led attacks if he becomes the Republican nominee, since the story of Bain Capital could be well-worn by then.
The South Carolina primary still poses an important test for Mr. Romney over the next seven days. He has sent mailers to voters across the state and placed radio ads reminding Republicans that he ''shares our values.''
Time is running short for Mr. Santorum, Mr. Gingrich and other rivals to slow his momentum. How Mr. Romney weathers the pressure will help determine the length of the party's nominating contest and which candidates move on to the next primary in Florida on Jan. 31.
''He has an enthusiasm gap, there's no question about that,'' said Chip Felkel, a Republican strategist who is not aligned with a candidate. ''But he's in South Carolina and not having to talk so much about cultural issues and abortion. Gingrich and Perry are paying the price for it.''
Conversations with nearly two dozen voters across the state revealed little interest among Republicans in the back-and-forth over Mr. Romney's financially rewarding days as a corporate executive. In several cases, people said they were drawn to Mr. Romney after hearing the pointed attacks from his rivals.
When Donald Hare, 69, a retiree on Hilton Head, was asked if he was a supporter of Mr. Romney, he declared, ''I am now.'' He added: ''What Newt did convinced me. He got into the gutter on Governor Romney.''
But while Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina introduced Mr. Romney at nearly every campaign stop last week as ''the only one that can beat President Obama this next election,'' his rivals argued otherwise. A variety of polls show that Mr. Romney has a lead in the race, but not a commanding one.
For his part, Mr. Santorum drew booming applause from crowds of several hundred people as he traveled across the Low Country region of the state last week. He implored those in his audiences to take a deeper look at the Republican field. He boiled down his argument against Mr. Romney to health care, Wall Street bailouts and support for climate change legislation.
''We have our leading candidate, who is downright wrong on all three of them,'' Mr. Santorum said. ''He creates a window for the Obama machine to make our candidate the issue in the race -- not the bad policies of this administration.''
Mr. Santorum notably did not join his Republican rivals in criticizing the business background of Mr. Romney. He focused squarely on his record as governor of Massachusetts, sending forth voters with this thought: ''We need contrasts, not just a paler shade of what we have.''
That line seemed to catch the attention of the audience here in Beaufort, where Mr. Santorum stood on the patio of the town's Yacht and Sailing Club taking questions for more than an hour. The unease over Mr. Romney's candidacy was clear from the tenor of the discussion.
Jack Schaaf, 85, who sold life insurance here after retiring from the Air Force, said he did not believe that Mr. Romney was sufficiently conservative on social or fiscal matters. He said he had seen most of the Republican presidential debates and intended to watch when candidates gather on Monday in Myrtle Beach and on Thursday in Charleston for two more debates.
Without being prompted, Mr. Schaaf volunteered the fact that he strongly sided with Mr. Romney regarding Bain Capital. He offered an explanation that echoed the campaign's defense.
''He was running an investment company that put money into distressed corporations and turned them around, reduced expenses or liquidated them. That's the business,'' Mr. Schaaf said. ''To be criticized for that is kind of a dirty dig.''
After pausing for a moment, Mr. Schaaf added: ''I'm not impressed with Romney. I don't think he is conservative enough, but he's certainly better than Obama.''

HEADLINE: The Benefits Of Bain Capitalism

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
THE debate over Mitt Romney's career at Bain Capital, in which several of his Republican rivals sound as if they're auditioning for a production of ''Les Miserables,'' is at heart a debate about the last 30 years of American capitalism.
In the decades after World War II, the United States economy was highly regulated, highly taxed and highly successful. War, tyranny and ideological mania had devastated our competitors, and while Asia stagnated and Europe struggled to rebuild, America grew and grew and grew. It was a golden age for the liberal model of political economy, with a powerful regulatory state presiding over labor-management cooperation and a steadily expanding middle class. 
But like all golden ages it passed. First in Europe and then in Asia, competitors emerged to challenge the United States' economic dominance. In this new landscape, the pillars of the postwar economic order began to look like liabilities. Our heavily unionized industries seemed sclerotic, our regulatory system stifling, our tax rates punitive. And so American policy makers, C.E.O.'s and investors responded by changing their priorities -- privileging growth over security, efficiency over equality, and embracing creative destruction on a scale that would have been unthinkable in the America of 1955.
In the private sector, this revolution was driven by men like Mitt Romney. As Ben Wallace-Wells put it in a New York magazine profile last October, Romney has spent his entire career seeking to ''perfect'' the American corporation, stripping ''its inefficiencies until it might function as a perfectly frictionless economic unit.''
This process didn't just involve pillaging companies and throwing their employees out onto the street, as Romney's more overheated critics charge. While Bain's record is hard to assess from the outside, one comprehensive studycited by Reihan Salam in The Daily suggests that private equity buyouts in general tend to have ''only a modest net impact on employment'' in the companies involved.
But neither was Romney the Henry Ford-esque job creator he's tried to play on the campaign trail. He served his investors, not his employees, and his goal was always to make an uncompetitive company competitive, even if that required cutting paychecks and shuttering plants along the way. What's more, Bain usually found a way to reap profits even when the overhaul failed and the company went belly-up.
In the broadest sense, though, the competitiveness revolution was good for the United States. In the 1970s, there were sound economic reasons to expect that other developed nations would gradually catch up to American living standards and per capita G.D.P. Instead, our rivals got rich, but we stayed richer. As Adam Davidson noted in last weekend's Times Magazine, ''even Europe's best-performing large country, Germany, is about 20 percent poorer than the U.S. on a per-person basis.''
But keeping America's edge came at a cost. Our economy became more efficient, but also more ruthless and Darwinian. Our G.D.P. kept rising, but the new wealth was less evenly distributed. The revolution delivered growth, but at the expense of stability and certainty. And for many Americans, even the ''modest net impact'' of private equity buyouts cost them a solid, good-paying job.
On the left, and now apparently in Newt Gingrich's campaign shop, there's a persistent suggestion that it could have been entirely otherwise -- that the midcentury model could have somehow been sustained, that the private equity ''vultures'' could have been held at bay, and that what worked for the United States when Europe was in ruins and half the world was Marxist-Leninist could have worked in the age of globalization as well.
This is a fantasy, unfortunately -- one that belongs to the world of Hollywood endings, where Gordon Gekko is defeated, Blue Star Airlines stays in business and Bud Fox's dad gets to retire with a solid pension. Indeed, it's such a fantasy that even Oliver Stone didn't quite believe in it: In ''Wall Street,'' Blue Star was saved from Gekko's clutches -- and presumably, from the real-life fate of an Eastern Airlines or a Pan Am -- not by a government subsidy or a benevolent Daddy Warbucks, but by a rival buyout specialist.
Still, just because the private equity revolution was necessary doesn't mean that it was an unmitigated good. And for Mitt Romney to frame criticisms of Bain as just ''the bitter politics of envy,'' as he did last week, displays a tone-deafness that could cost him the presidency. No one -- and certainly no politician -- who has profited so immensely from an age of insecurity should ever appear to be lecturing the people who've lost out.
Instead, Romney needs to prove to anxious voters that he and his party have more to offer them than just Bain capitalism alone. To win the White House, he'll need to promise not only competition that leads to growth, but growth that leads to broadly shared prosperity. To defend his revolution, he'll need to show that he's reckoned with its costs.

HEADLINE: History vs. the Tea Party

BYLINE: By SAM TANENHAUS. 
The editor of The New York Times Book Review.

 BODY:
FOR more than two years, conservatives have been riding a wave of Tea Party insurgency that has formed the most dynamic force in American politics, a protest movement that promised to slash taxes, close the federal deficit and remake Washington. And yet to judge from the results of the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, some of the most engaged Republican voters are inching closer to nominating Mitt Romney, the candidate they like least, a Harvard-educated technocrat who is in many ways a mirror image of the president the insurgents want to dislodge.
Even in South Carolina, a seat of conservative activism, the opposition to Mr. Romney appears to be fragmented and diffuse, as Matt Bai reports this weekend in The Times Magazine. Others have put the case more bluntly. ''Where's the Tea Party?'' a headline on Politico asked last week. 
This is all the more puzzling because the Tea Party movement did not lack for useful precedents or operating models. On the contrary, it is ''the latest in a cycle of insurgencies on the Republican right,'' as the historian Geoffrey Kabaservice writes in his new book, ''Rule and Ruin,'' a chronicle of half a century of internecine Republican warfare. ''Even the name of the movement was a throwback to the 'T Parties' of the early '60s, part of the right-wing, anti-tax crusade of that era.''
On its surface the Tea Party movement snugly fits this pattern. An organized grass-roots revolt, its influence was decisive in the 2010 elections, when an energized base propelled Republicans to enormous gains in the House, helped secure Senate victories for fresh faces like Rand Paul and Marco Rubio and captured as many as 700 seats in state legislatures. The movement drove the Republican agenda to the right, making stars of legislators like Senator Jim DeMint and Representative Paul Ryan, and did much to shift the political debate from the jobless recovery to the growing national debt.
But even in those early, heady days there were signs of trouble.
In February 2010, while a conservative mandarin like William Kristol, the publisher and editor of The Weekly Standard, exulted that the Tea Party protest was ''the best thing that has happened to the Republican Party in recent times,'' Sarah Palin, the figure who has come closest to tapping directly into the movement's animating passions, sent a very different message. Her keynote address to the Tea Party convention, held that month in Nashville, Tenn., and broadcast by both Fox News and MSNBC, was widely received (by, among others, David Broder, the consummate Beltway insider), as signaling a possible presidential run. But Ms. Palin's remarks were essentially those of a supporter of the new insurgency, rather than its leader. Indeed, she explicitly rejected a leading role. ''I caution against allowing this movement to be defined by any one leader or politician,'' she said. ''The Tea Party movement is not a top-down operation. It's a ground-up call to caution that is forcing both parties to change the way they're doing business, and that's beautiful.'' True to this sentiment, she chose to remain a media presence rather than a political one and eventually decided not to enter the presidential contest. Already there was a growing schism on the right, its fault lines precisely those Ms. Palin identified, between the elite -- including Mr. Kristol and other journalists who had been among her first champions -- and the base. This is a strikingly new development on the right.
It is hard to imagine a similar conflict happening during previous conservative insurgent cycles, mainly because they were centralized operations, often guided by insiders, in many cases Ivy League intellectuals who helped groom political figures for the national stage.
THE first successful insurgency, Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign in 1964, was the brainchild of seasoned insiders in Washington and New York. Its strategic headquarters were on the East Coast -- in fact a suite on Lexington Avenue, near Grand Central Terminal. Its organizational genius, F. Clifton White, a political scientist who had taught at Cornell, teamed up with William Rusher, the publisher of National Review. Together they sewed up slates of delegates even as Goldwater fared poorly in a series of contested primaries against moderates like Henry Cabot Lodge, Nelson Rockefeller and William Scranton. Some of the ground troops for the Goldwater campaign were members of the Young Americans for Freedom, an organization created on the family estate of National Review's editor, William F. Buckley Jr., in Sharon, Conn.
All the while, intellectuals were burnishing the Goldwater brand. One of National Review's editors, L. Brent Bozell, wrote speeches for him and ghosted his manifesto, ''Conscience of a Conservative.'' Meanwhile, the journal became, in effect, a briefing book on a potential Goldwater presidency, weighing in with dozens of articles and policy proposals -- on taxation, social security, labor law, foreign policy, military expenditures, race relations and more. One of National Review's brightest young stars, Garry Wills, theorized that Goldwater might compensate for his controversial vote against the 1964 Civil Rights Act if he set forth his own vision of racial justice, ''encouraging private initiative where laws have not reached or cannot'' -- for instance by adopting a ''policy of preferential hiring,'' an idea that prefigured affirmative action.
In another essay, the literary scholar Hugh Kenner argued that since Beltway ideas originated within the universities, Goldwater might enrich ''the tonality of the entire network'' by ''bringing to the academic ear Chicagoan rather than Keynesian economics.'' One of those Chicagoans, Milton Friedman, an adviser to Goldwater, devised a model for a negative income tax. This idea later evolved into the current Earned Income Tax Credit, which provides a refund to many low- and moderate-income earners.
For these conservatives, the prospect of a Goldwater presidency offered more than protest against Democrats and liberals. It was an opportunity ''to crystallize the conservative position in national affairs,'' as Mr. Buckley explained after Goldwater's devastating defeat in the general election. Crystallizing the position meant giving it more coherence and also making a case that skeptics and adversaries would have to take seriously. Goldwater intellectuals, including Mr. Wills and the novelist John Dos Passos, then joined a new organization, the American Conservative Union, which still is a powerful Beltway institution.
INTELLECTUALS were instrumental as well in the next great conservative insurgency, Ronald Reagan's challenge to President Gerald R. Ford in 1976. The campaign drew on arguments in books like Mr. Rusher's ''The Making of a New Majority Party,'' Kevin Phillips's ''Mediacracy'' and Patrick J. Buchanan's ''Conservative Votes, Liberal Victories.'' Each posited that the blue-collar Democratic constituency rooted in the New Deal had grown increasingly conservative, alienated from ''big government.'' Parallel arguments could be found in The Public Interest, the policy quarterly that specialized in rigorous critiques of federal antipoverty initiatives and pension fund ''socialism.''
Such debate had the effect of uniting intellectuals with politicians, and of bridging differences that might otherwise have separated ''top-down'' strategists from ''bottom up'' activists.
Of course, the Tea Party faithful also claim that theirs is a movement of ideas, in many cases the same ideas that Goldwater and Reagan espoused. But they tend to emphasize quixotic crusades -- the repeal of the 17th Amendment, which established the election of United States senators by popular vote, or Representative Ron Paul's mission to abolish the Federal Reserve. Beyond this, ''candidates who claimed the mantle of fiscal conservatism had no real plans for reducing government expenditures beyond the conservative pursuit of politics-as-warfare,'' Mr. Kabaservice writes. They favor ''cutting programs that benefited Democratic constituencies while preserving programs that benefited Republican constituencies and avoiding any serious reform of defense spending or middle-class entitlement programs.''
Tea Party adherents are often ''strategically ambiguous'' on fundamental economic issues, the Harvard scholars Theda Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson note in their new book, ''The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism.'' They describe a conference last April, in which Jenny Beth Martin, one of the founders of Tea Party Patriots Inc., was asked about specific tax and health care measures. In the authors' account, Ms. Martin said there was ''no need to discuss the actual content of legislation because good proposals are always to be found at think tanks such as the Cato Institute or the Heritage Foundation.'' In ''Tea Party Patriots,'' Ms. Martin's own new book, written with Mark Meckler, the organization's co-founder, there is some policy discussion along with familiar denunciations of government overreach. The book also proposes a ''Forty-Year Plan for America's Future.'' It is weak on specifics. ''What will the final plan look like?'' Ms. Martin and Mr. Meckler ask. ''One thing we can tell you from experience is that it will be far better, and wiser, than anything that any of us can imagine right now. When the creativity, ingenuity, and genius of the American people are unleashed, wonderful things happen.''
Perhaps, but it's not a plan. It's a preachment, aimed at the like-minded. The same is true of the Tea Party movement itself. Dick Armey, himself a Beltway insider before he became the chairman of FreedomWorks, one of the most powerful Tea Party organizations, acknowledged as much when he reportedly told the freshman Republicans shortly after the 2010 election: ''You don't owe your office to the majority. You owe your office to the people who put you there.'' Those people, however, compose only a fraction of the electorate. And that fraction is divided. For now the beneficiary is Mitt Romney, who has emerged, paradoxically, as a kind of Goldwater in reverse, the lone moderate in a field of insurgents. Like Goldwater in 1964, he has swatted away each new rival, though in this instance they have been Tea Party favorites like Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and Ron Paul. Another target, Newt Gingrich, may be the most credentialed insurgent in the field, the mastermind of the 1994 Republican revolution, which gave the party its first majority in the House of Representatives since the 1952 election.
After National Review denounced Mr. Gingrich, when he briefly rose to challenge Mr. Romney in Iowa, an article in The American Spectator, a conservative magazine that has been sympathetic to the insurgents, suggested that ''William Buckley's defiantly against-the-wind conservative masterpiece has gone G.O.P. establishment.'' A more accurate term might be conservative establishment. But then, as Sarah Palin, whose own rise to celebrity was partly the doing of editors at National Review and The Weekly Standard, knows all too well, that particular establishment prefers to direct its revolutions from above.

HEADLINE: Where Optimism Feels Out of Reach

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
So many of the civic successes heralded by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in his annual State of the City address on Thursday -- the expansion of the High Line, a new East River ferry service, the luring of Cornell University to Roosevelt Island, groundbreaking on a new Whitney Museum -- might have happened in Lithuania for all the effect they have had (or could have) on the lives of people in Brownsville, in northeastern Brooklyn.
Even the mayor's claim that the city is exceedingly healthy and safe meets grim rebuttal in Brownsville: the neighborhood maintains the highest infant mortality rate in the city, a rate about the same as Malaysia's. While the murder rate in the crime-ridden Morrisania section of the Bronx, where the mayor delivered his speech, fell 25 percent from 1998 to 2011, in Brownsville over the same period, it declined not at all. 
Brownsville is a neighborhood so distinguished by negatives that even on a cloudless day, a dismal, enervating tension can take hold. In this sense, it is a place that has changed little since the days of Alfred Kazin's boyhood in the 1920s and '30s -- days that, Mr. Kazin, the writer and literary critic, chronicled with such a cool and distanced sentimentality in his memoir, ''A Walker in the City.''
Then as now, poverty and gang violence impede any feeling of sustained civility. Having read Mr. Kazin's book recently, and invited others to do so, I was compelled to visit a part of the city that like almost no other has seemed ordained to its depredations -- a counterpoint to the reigning mood of municipal optimism.
As I walked up and around Pitkin Avenue, the neighborhood's main commercial thoroughfare, I encountered people who felt not only that the quality of life had barely improved since the days of the crack epidemic in the '80s and '90s, but that in certain respects it had grown worse.
Early in my excursion, I met Anthony Morrison, a poet and 35-year resident of Brownsville who works at a hair salon across the street from a just-completed apartment complex, built by Habitat for Humanity. He took little comfort in this sign of renewal. The violence in the neighboring public housing facilities (Brownsville has one of the highest concentrations of public housing in the city) is so intense, Mr. Morrison told me, that if he is ever moved to go out at night, he goes to Manhattan. Anxieties have only escalated since October, when a young mother lost her life trying to protect school children from sniper fire one afternoon. Over the years, several of Mr. Morrison's friends have been killed. Since 1994, he said, he has lost 200 of his 300 clients at the salon.
Ignored by gentrification, the businesses of Brownsville are up against the repercussions of not only a weakened national economy but also, to a certain extent, of a retracted drug trade that however insidious kept money in the neighborhood in motion. The Handsome Boutique, at 1603 Pitkin Avenue, a purveyor of men's suits and clothes, has been owned and operated by Iqbal Chhabra, an Indian immigrant, since 1984, when he chose the location over Jamaica Avenue in Queens because the sidewalks of Pitkin Avenue were then always teeming. ''I saw no store empty here,'' Mr. Chhabra said. It was typical in those days, he said, for men to arrive at the Handsome Boutique with wads of cash to be spent on suits that were not meant to signal a quiet tastefulness.
Mr. Chhabra pointed out that in January the store was still full of inventory, which years ago would have hardly been the case. ''Now it is as though Christmas never happened,'' he said.
In the '20s, '30s and '40s, Pitkin Avenue, which figures greatly in Mr. Kazin's memoir, drew shoppers from around the city -- in 1942 there were 43 men's clothing stores alone. But as a study conducted in the '30s indicated, few Brownsville families managed to join the ranks of the city's middle-income population. Today, the enormous challenge of trying to develop an indigenous middle class in the neighborhood seems to have been taken up, at least in part, by Daniel Murphy, an affable and energetic urban planner who a year ago became the director of the Pitkin Avenue Business Improvement District. After some effort, I found Mr. Murphy's windowless office up a winding linoleum staircase in the back of the second floor of Shopper's World, past aisles of elastic slippers, towels and DVDs.
The gateway to Pitkin Avenue is the fabled Loew's Pitkin theater erected in 1929, the place where Mr. Kazin pursued his escapism. The building has been vacant for decades but is being refurbished by a Westchester County developer. A charter school, Brooklyn Ascend, part of a small nonprofit chain run by Steven F. Wilson, the Harvard-educated author of Massachusetts's charter school law, will soon occupy the top floors. The bottom floors will be filled by retailers; and while that might not seem like a logical fit, they will bring jobs to an area where the largest employer, Mr. Murphy told me, is the seemingly doomed United States Postal Service.
Mr. Murphy faces many challenges: Pitkin Avenue has no parking meters because the Department of Transportation took them out 15 years ago. For the revamped theater, Mr. Murphy said he'd like, above all, to see a place ''where a guy can bring a date; where you can get a salad.''
''I've never liked chains,'' he said. ''But right now I'd be really happy with an Applebee's.''

HEADLINE: The Tea Party's not-so-Civil War

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
I met Karen Martin, a few days before New Year's, at a cafe in Greenville, the hub of conservative politics in South Carolina. A 54-year-old refugee from the North Shore of Massachusetts, Martin is the lead organizer of the nearby Spartanburg Tea Party. Another Tea Party leader described her to me as a grown-up, and in fact, Martin turned out to be the kind of activist -- ideology notwithstanding -- who makes you feel hopeful about the new age of political uprising. She recounted how she burst into tears at the moment she realized, watching the news in 2008, that children growing up today wouldn't have the economic opportunities that she did. She talked about how the Tea Party would need to mature and become more politically sophisticated in the years ahead. ''I think the movement is just too young and too emotional,'' she said.
Then our conversation turned to Mitt Romney, and Martin's sunny countenance darkened. ''I don't know a single Tea Party person,'' she said, slowly drawing out her words, ''who does not despise Mitt Romney to the very core of their being.'' I searched her face for levity or compassion, but found neither. 
Discussions about the Tea Party often miss the extent to which the movement is loose and leaderless, a disjointed collection of local chapters and agendas. But if the phenomenon has an epicenter, that place is South Carolina. The state's junior senator, Jim DeMint, is generally seen as the ideological forefather of the Tea Party, at least among elected officials. Tea Party activism propelled South Carolina's 39-year-old governor, Nikki Haley, into office in 2010, along with four new Republican congressmen. There are, by some estimates, more than 50 autonomous Tea Party groups operating throughout the state, and according to a recent Winthrop University poll, 61 percent of South Carolinians say they approve of the movement -- more than double the national figure, according to data from the Pew Research Center.
When you talk to activists around the state, as I did recently during a weeklong visit, you hear a lot about Romney's record on health care, specifically, and about his ideological squishiness in general. But you also come to understand that the antipathy in Tea Party circles is more visceral. It's a reaction to what they perceive as Romney's synthetic and calculating persona, the sense that he somehow embodies everything that's false and impenetrable about the parties in Washington. And so South Carolina, which will hold its presidential primary Jan. 21, is the place where two powerful political vehicles -- Mitt Romney's establishment-backed campaign and the three-year-old Tea Party insurgency -- will collide full force. It's here where Tea Party activists have expected to assert their influence over the party's nominating process. For most of them, that means, above all, stopping Mitt.
The problem is that they've had a hard time settling on any obvious alternative to Romney, in a way that might transform the primary into a clear, binary choice. After a startling finish in Iowa, Rick Santorum seemed likely to steal significant votes from rivals like Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul and to fill the smallish void left by Michele Bachmann. But even as Santorum moved to consolidate conservative support, Tea Party organizers remained largely splintered among the rival campaigns. Their most influential leader, DeMint, declined to throw his support one way or the other. Haley, meanwhile, decided to endorse Romney in mid-December, a tactical decision that mostly drew derision from her Tea Party followers.
After months of confusion and bickering over whom to support, a kind of unraveling has occurred at the upper reaches of the movement, in some cases causing friendships to fray and giving rise to charges and countercharges on Facebook. Officers have resigned. Angry statements have been issued. Reputations have been damaged.
Martin herself remained neutral when we met, though she said she was giving Newt Gingrich a longer look. ''I've been forced to recognize that he might be the best weapon we have,'' she said, though she was far more enthusiastic about the tomato soup on her tray. Martin was confident that her fellow Tea Partiers would, in the months after the primary, repair whatever wounds have opened, but she had all but given up hope that they might agree on a candidate before the voting starts. ''I've talked to so many Tea Party members who said, 'I will never again hold my nose and vote for someone,' '' she told me. ''They will vote for the pure candidate who doesn't have accomplishments and who's just going to get chewed up.''
The group of influential Republicans who came up with the idea for a South Carolina primary back in the late 1970s had a few goals in mind. First, they were hoping to bolster the Republican presence in the State Legislature, where they were then a perennial minority. Second, they wanted to give the emerging Republican South -- with its mix of evangelicals, military families and states rights' conservatives -- an earlier and more influential voice in the nominating process.
They could hardly have met with more success. Three decades later, South Carolina is as reliably red as a state can be. And when it came to picking a nominee, South Carolina emerged as the firewall for the new party establishment -- more Southern and Western than the old, northeastern elites -- that came into power with Ronald Reagan. In every presidential campaign since 1980, the presumed front-runner and establishment favorite has come into South Carolina bruised and imperiled, having lost in Iowa or New Hampshire. And in every instance, that candidate has managed to win the primary and go on to win the nomination.
This year, though, that dynamic has reversed itself, and South Carolina has become the only possible firewall for the conservative base that hopes to stop the front-runner. If the discontented activists who stormed the party in 2010 can't find a way to take out the establishment's chosen nominee here, of all places, then they might as well slap those Romney/Rubio bumper stickers on their S.U.V.'s now and get it over with.
There are plenty of reasons to think that Romney, in South Carolina, is eminently beatable. Four years ago, he wagered several million dollars in the state only to come in fourth. This time, Romney has only sporadically visited the state -- much to the frustration of a lot of local politicos who might otherwise have jumped in on his behalf -- and by year's end he had only a handful of paid staff members in South Carolina.
But fortune has been kind to Romney in this campaign. Because the field took shape so slowly last year, and because no other candidate ever had the money needed to stage a truly national campaign, the contest never really made it to South Carolina in advance of the voting. Driving around the state, I saw few yard signs and heard no radio ads. Influential Republicans in Columbia note, with a hint of regret, that the personal malice and trickery that have so inflamed past primary campaigns -- like the insidious rumor back in 2000 that had John McCain fathering an illegitimate black child -- have been utterly lacking before next week's vote. It's as if South Carolina Republicans, having largely been bypassed by this year's candidates, simply decided at some point to sit back, wait for Iowa and New Hampshire to finish voting, then pack the entire primary campaign into 10 days of mayhem.
What all of this means is that Romney hasn't missed much action by skipping the state up to this point, and with support for his more ideological rivals there so fragmented, he could easily win with a relatively low percentage of the vote. Four years ago, McCain stole a victory in South Carolina and cemented his hold on the nomination, winning with only 33 percent of the vote because Mike Huckabee, Fred Thompson and Romney split most of what remained. There's a good chance Romney will do the same.
It's generally assumed that a big part of Romney's problem four years ago had to do with his Mormonism, which presented a hurdle for South Carolina's sizable bloc of evangelical Christians. None of the Republicans with whom I talked, however, felt that it was much of a factor now. ''If you want to debate whether Mormonism is a form of orthodox Christianity in South Carolina, then there is no debate here -- it is not,'' said Oran Smith, who runs Palmetto Family, a group that lobbies on behalf of Christian conservatives. ''But is that important to his doing well in South Carolina? No.'' In fact, Smith told me, ''I think there are a lot of people who are for Romney and who are just afraid to admit it right now.''
He also acknowledged what other Republican leaders had been telling me -- that on the whole, religious conservatives, who once dominated South Carolina politics through the intervention of powerful figures and institutions like Pat Robertson and Bob Jones University, are just less engaged this time and are wielding less influence over the process. Leaning back on the upholstered couch in his office, Smith, dressed in a cream turtleneck sweater and black-and-green-plaid pants, hypothesized that the lapse in political urgency might have something to do with a corresponding drop in millennial angst.
''There are a lot of folks who believe that we are really in the end times,'' he told me, ''and the election of Obama was a signal that the end times were here.'' But after Republicans came roaring back in 2010, he said, a lot of those conservatives decided that maybe the apocalypse was still a way off, after all.
Instead, the energy this year is with the Tea Party, whose members represent an amalgam of disparate groups -- Christian conservatives, libertarians, disgruntled independents. At various moments over the past year, activists here, as in the rest of the country, found themselves enthralled with a rotating cast of candidates: Bachmann, Perry, Herman Cain, Gingrich and now Santorum. (''I expected by this time for Rick Perry to just be kicking fanny in South Carolina,'' Smith told me. ''He was going to ride in and lasso South Carolina, and he wasn't going to be stopped.'') By the time I visited the state, the movement was still deeply divided among several far-from-perfect candidates.
All the activists I talked to agreed that if there was any one person who might have been able to break through the clutter and channel all of this energy behind a single candidate, it was Jim DeMint. ''None of them impress me at all,'' Karen Martin said of the Republican candidates, ''but if Jim DeMint were to walk into the room, I'd just start crying.'' Having endorsed Romney four years earlier, DeMint pointedly refused to do so again, which was seen as something of a statement in itself. But the senator didn't find any of the other candidates inspiring enough to warrant an endorsement, either. In other words, he felt pretty much the same way as his most ardent constituents. It seemed very unlikely, though not impossible, that DeMint would insert himself into the primary before the votes were cast.
Absent some direction from DeMint, Tea Party leaders in South Carolina had settled into a standoff. Everyone agreed that it would be better for the movement to coalesce behind a single candidate who could topple Romney. But everyone seemed to be waiting for the moment when all the activists working for other campaigns would realize that his or her candidate was clearly the one they should rally behind. ''It's tough,'' Mike Vasovski, who is Ron Paul's state chairman, told me. ''How do you compromise yourself if you're really committed to someone?''
Vasovski is an affable family doctor and a Tea Party activist in rural Aiken County, near the Georgia border. When I met him and his wife, Cindy, at their favorite pizza place, he told me that Paul was the first candidate for whom he ever worked, and he likened his passion -- the campaign was taking up about 40 hours of his week -- to the way liberals must have felt about Robert Kennedy. He was getting ready to pile a bunch of volunteers into his truck the next morning and drive the 1,000 miles to Iowa.
I asked Vasovski whether there were any other candidates he found intriguing, just as a backup.
''Huntsman is interesting,'' he said. It's hard to find a Republican candidate less like Paul than Jon Huntsman, and the puzzlement must have shown on my face. ''He understands China,'' Vasovski said, as if this explained the disconnect.
I wondered if any of the other, more clearly conservative candidates might interest him -- maybe Gingrich or Santorum?
Vasovski thought for a moment. ''No,'' he said. ''Not in the least.''
As in other states, the story of the Tea Party in South Carolina is largely the story of newcomers to the political process, people who harbored conservative views but had never before felt moved to become involved in politics, or in some cases even to vote. In the months that followed the initial rallies in 2009 (at the Bi-Lo Center in Greenville, about 10,000 people came out to vent), organizers of the various chapters forged close friendships through e-mail and Facebook. It's a familiar narrative, one I heard frequently while writing about leftist blogs during the Bush years and again while spending time with the founder of the Utah Tea Party in 2010. The modern, online movement is about more than politics; it's about building community too, which is why it's probably not a coincidence that several of the most involved activists I met had recently moved to South Carolina from someplace else.
But South Carolina isn't just another state with pent-up fury at the status quo. It's also an early and crucial primary state, and so it was inevitable that the Tea Party movement there would attract the attention of Republican candidates looking to gain an organizational foothold. In the same way that big-time contributors and evangelical activists had always been highly sought as recruits by the various campaigns, so now were the Tea Party volunteers in demand. ''All of the campaigns, in one form or another, except for Romney's, have contacted me,'' Karen Martin said matter-of-factly, as if we were discussing cellphone carriers offering special deals.
The most aggressive candidates throughout the fall were Bachmann and Gingrich. As far back as 2009, Gingrich's Washington-based advocacy group, American Solutions, employed a Tea Party liaison, a 26-year-old Connecticut native named Adam Waldeck, to connect Gingrich to organizers around the country. In October, Waldeck moved down to South Carolina full time to assume control of Gingrich's statewide operation, working out of a Greenville strip plaza. He soon put three Tea Party organizers on his payroll, a move that caused some alarm inside the movement.
Still, things remained mostly copacetic until the endorsements started. In general, there was widespread disagreement inside and among the various chapters about whether to endorse candidates. And then in December, a vocal Tea Party chapter in Myrtle Beach voted to endorse Gingrich. This might not have been so notable, except that the treasurer of the Myrtle Beach chapter was being paid by the Gingrich campaign. Several of Bachmann's backers soon issued a statement accusing Gingrich's Tea Party supporters of having betrayed the cause. Activists quickly chose sides. Bachmann inflamed the situation by echoing the allegations in an interview with CNN, suggesting that ''money is changing hands'' in South Carolina's Tea Party.
''I took personal offense to that,'' Allen Olson, wearing a khaki Tea Party hat and a gray Tea Party polo shirt, said when we met at a steakhouse on the outskirts of Columbia. Olson is a carpenter who moved here from Milwaukee about a decade ago, and served as chairman of the Columbia Tea Party before resigning last fall so he could endorse Gingrich. He recalled bitterly that he had once spoken to a high-school civics class taught by Kelly Payne, a Tea Party leader who was working for Bachmann and who had signed her name to the allegations. ''There's no way I'll be able to work with Kelly Payne again,'' he said, shaking his head in disgust.
I asked if he had lost other friends in the movement because of divisions over the campaign.
''Not really, because if they're doing this stuff, then they were never really friends to begin with,'' Olson said. ''I'm losing acquaintances.'' He sipped glumly from his Bud Light. ''The only thing I want to do is just to cut all the bickering, realize it's not going to be a single voting bloc and just stop burning bridges.''
Like some other Tea Party leaders I talked to, Olson posited that all of this started with Republican consultants, who were purposely infiltrating and dividing the movement. You could make a solid case that South Carolina is where the modern culture of the political consultant was born; Republican politics here have been heavily influenced by a generation of well-paid strategists and dirty tricksters, going back to Harry Dent, an architect of Nixon's ''Southern Strategy,'' and Lee Atwater, who was most famous for devising the Willie Horton ad that helped sink Michael Dukakis. Tea Party activists generally blame consultants for having bled the party of its conservative convictions. ''They call themselves conservatives, but they're not -- they're Lee Atwater-type Republicans,'' Olson told me at one point, when discussing the party's establishment politicians. When I asked what it was about Atwater, who played a significant role in moving the party viciously to the right in the 1980s, that seemed insufficiently conservative, he replied, ''The way I understand it, he was more interested in numbers than in principle.''
Olson and other Tea Party adherents were now focusing their ire on Wesley Donehue, a Columbia-based consultant who advised Bachmann's ill-fated campaign and who was the first to publicly raise the issue of Gingrich paying Tea Party members. Clearly, the Tea Party leaders said, Donehue had been whispering nefariously in Bachmann's ear and was trying to turn real conservatives against one another.
Not surprisingly, Donehue rejected this theory. ''That's stupid,'' he told me when we talked a few days before Bachmann flamed out in Iowa and left the race. ''I'm just calling out the Tea Parties who have strayed from what the Tea Party believes in.'' Then he added, for good measure, ''Newt Gingrich is the antithesis of everything the Tea Party stands for.''
In fact, I had little doubt that Donehue had set out to do exactly the thing that political consultants often try to do, which is to ''drive a wedge'' between an opposing candidate and his potential supporters. But as I talked to Tea Party activists involved in the imbroglio, it seemed there was something else going on, too. The Tea Party leaders were getting a sense of what it was like to be real players in the process, and some of them, however sincere their beliefs, found themselves drawn to the idea of having the very same back-room influence that they criticized in the consultants. Like an earlier generation of Ralph Reeds and Gary Bauers, they were transforming themselves from activists into advisers and even candidates, and this was bound to strain a movement whose entire identity was based on disdaining the establishment.
''You're starting to see some of the Tea Party folks getting into that realm, becoming political consultants,'' Bill Connor, a Tea Party activist who's backing Santorum, told me when I visited his home in Orangeburg. An Army Ranger who was the senior American adviser to local forces in Afghanistan's Helmand province, Connor looks a bit like Roger Clemens and projects a stern sobriety. ''Being around politics, it's like a drug,'' he said. ''People love having their name in the paper, getting attention, having people suck up to them. And that's happening with the Tea Party.''
I got some sense of what Connor was talking about when I called Gerri McDaniel, treasurer of the Myrtle Beach Tea Party. McDaniel was singled out by Donehue; she took a paid position with Gingrich just a few weeks before her chapter voted to endorse him.
''You know Rick Perry's saying, when he first came to South Carolina, that the Tea Party was the 'boots on the ground' in South Carolina?'' McDaniel asked me. I told her I did not, which seemed to surprise her. ''That's my saying,'' she said. ''I'm the one who said, 'The Tea Party is the boots on the ground.' They took that from me.''
McDaniel went on to tell me that she had not taken the process of making an endorsement lightly and that every one of the candidates had taken the time to meet her. ''I had quite a few candidates who wanted me on board with them,'' McDaniel said. ''I chose the candidate who I thought could turn this country around. It wouldn't have mattered if I was paid or not.''
McDaniel said she was trying to ignore all the controversy. ''You have to keep your head up,''she said. ''Just don't get pulled into areas that can change you as a person.''
The Capitol in Columbia was closed the week after Christmas, but I found Curtis Loftis, South Carolina's treasurer, puttering around his office in a blue oxford shirt and khakis. The 53-year-old Loftis, heir to a local pest-control business, never ran for office before 2010, when he decided to take on the incumbent treasurer and caught the same Tea Party wave that swept Haley into the more august office across the hall. He's now serving as Romney's campaign chairman in the state. That both officials endorsed Romney would seem to signal some kind of coordinated decision at the highest levels of the Tea Party leadership in South Carolina, but such is the danger of thinking about the Tea Party as a single, cohesive entity. It's well known in Columbia that Haley and Loftis are disinclined to stand in the same room together, much less coordinate their political decisions.
As we sat in leather armchairs on either side of a coffee table, Loftis explained to me that, now that he was actually serving in elective office, he had come to understand how important it was to choose a candidate who could actually do the job in question, rather than one who said all the right things about slashing government and all of that.
''Before, when I was strictly looking at it as a partisan from the outside, I could understand exactly why people are working themselves up over these other candidates,'' Loftis said. ''And these people who are actively engaged in such heated debates -- they're my brothers and sisters, you know? I get them, and I understand them, and I appreciate them.'' But, he added, ''I'm just not interested in this ongoing conversation about first principles and this heated rhetoric.''
According to Loftis, Romney was the only Republican running with real expertise. ''Every time I'm with him, I bring him a financial problem from my desk and let him solve it,'' Loftis said, motioning toward the accordion files stacked on his table. At another point, he guiltily described for me marching Romney through a roomful of contributors at a Loftis fund-raiser: ''I felt like he was an old mule that I had ridden hard and put up wet.'' I found myself imagining how stoked Mitt Romney must be to see Curtis Loftis pop up on his schedule.
Loftis told me he liked a lot of the other candidates too. ''I love Rick Santorum,'' he said. ''I spent a good amount of time with Rick. He's a goodguy.'' But neither Santorum nor any other of Romney's rivals, he said, was going to be able to win in pivotal, more moderate states like Ohio and Florida. And Loftis seemed confident that as Primary Day approached, more and more of the Tea Party members who supported him in the treasurer's race -- maybe even those who angrily canceled fund-raisers after they heard he was going to work for Romney -- would get their heads around that reality.
''If you want four more years of Barack, then go off on a flight of fancy and vote your constitutional conscience,'' Loftis said. ''But if you want to stop Barack Obama, Mitt Romney is your guy.''
Of course, most ardent Tea Party activists would tell you that this kind of calculation is exactly what drove them out of their homes and into parking lots and public squares in the first place. The way they see it, ''big-government conservatives'' and ''crony capitalists'' have been doing whatever it takes to get elected and re-elected for decades, while Republicans in Washington caved on the small-government principles that were supposed to guide the party. For a Romney supporter to preach pragmatism and electability only confirms for your average Tea Party member everything he or she already suspected about the candidate. You might as well try selling an Escalade to Greenpeace.
And yet, it's precisely this aversion to political calculation that may relegate the movement to the margins, at least as far as the 2012 nomination is concerned. The pragmatic thing, after all, would have been for the various Tea Party leaders to coalesce around a single conservative candidate who might beat Romney in South Carolina. But such machinations would have been antithetical to the decentralized, uncompromising nature of the movement. Instead, activists followed their own impulses and their own agendas, the result being that they may yet find themselves flattened by a less energized but more cohesive establishment.
It's not as if they can't see this. In the days after the Iowa vote and just before New Hampshire, as polls showed Romney surging in South Carolina, activists in the state seemed ready to embrace Santorum in hopes of turning the primary into a referendum on Romney, rather than a multiple-choice test with several right answers. ''My sense is there will be a very large coalescing of forces around Rick Santorum,'' Stephen Brown, a conservative activist and Bachmann supporter, told me on the day his candidate withdrew from the race. ''I think he's going to be the guy.''
When I called Karen Martin, though, she sounded less sure. ''I've had some e-mails from Tea Party people today saying, 'Look, can we just put our emotions aside and get behind the candidate who has the best path to victory?' '' she said. ''But I just don't know if that's possible.''
I asked her which candidate had the best path to victory. There was a pause on the line.
''And that's the question,'' she finally said.

HEADLINE: The Image Officer With a Lot to Fix

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
IT'S show time for Anne M. Finucane.
Her co-star on this day, Bill Clinton, is waiting offstage. The audience shifts in its seats. The spotlight goes up and ... action!
It's a Thursday in early December, at a conference center near Orlando, and Ms. Finucane is busy shaping an image. Or, rather, trying to reshape one. This choreographed interview with the former president before a select group of businesspeople is, in fact, part of a much larger effort to rehabilitate one of the most demonized corporations in America.
That company is Ms. Finucane's employer, Bank of America. Until recently, this colossus, assembled through a heady run of acquisitions, was the nation's largest bank. But since the 2008-9 financial crisis, no big bank has lost more of its luster.
Today, Bank of America is often held up as a symbol of all that's wrong with banking, from stick-it-to-'em fees to dubious home foreclosures. Investors have given it a black eye, too. Last year, its share price plummeted 55 percent, making it the biggest loser among the Dow industrials. The bank remains under unusually close scrutiny by regulators. 
All of this -- and more -- poses daunting challenges for Ms. Finucane (pronounced fin-NEW-kin), one of the most powerful figures at Bank of America and, indeed, in American banking. Yet given her position, it might come as a surprise that she isn't a financial whiz or, for that matter, even a banker. Her official title is global strategy and marketing officer, but the designation only hints at her influence within the bank, on Wall Street, in Washington and beyond.
Over a 17-year career at the bank and its predecessors, Ms. Finucane, 59, has spun a web of relationships in business, politics, the media and philanthropy. For years, she was a confidante of Kenneth D. Lewis, the executive who built Bank of America with a string of daring takeovers, and whose downfall is remembered as a pivotal moment in the financial crisis. Now she is a confidante of Mr. Lewis's successor, Brian T. Moynihan, who has been struggling to turn this battleship around. Mr. Moynihan is the chief executive, but Ms. Finucane is, in effect, the chief image officer.
''We all report to Anne,'' Mr. Moynihan once joked.
Ms. Finucane shrugs off such wisecracks. But she is serious about the challenges confronting the bank. For despite deep ties to Washington, as well as to Boston, where she and her husband, Mike Barnicle, are an A-list power couple, she isn't having much fun these days. Yes, she's tight with Representative Barney Frank, one of the most powerful and colorful figures on Capitol Hill. Yes, she vacations on Cape Cod, near her friends the Kennedys. And, yes, she is a powerhouse on the charity circuit.
But fixing Bank of America, in the eyes of the nation, is a tall order. Colleagues describe her as ''blunt,'' ''brutal'' and ''a political operator''; on the positive side, they say she always has her ear close to the ground and is effective at getting what she wants.
''This is not the best moment,'' she said in early December. ''This is the most complicated and the most challenging of my professional life.''
She continued, saying that you can't fix a reputation just with new slogans. ''In order to repair reputation,'' she said, ''you have to repair the issues that underlie that.''
Still, last week, the bank announced that it had begun reviewing its advertising and image strategy.
In an interview, Ms. Finucane explained that the bank was operating in a ''very distracted environment with a lot of finger-pointing and a lot of missteps.'' She added: ''I would like to demonstrate setting a new course, which Brian put in place, but we need to articulate.''
By almost any measure, Bank of America has fallen hard. In 2008, before the crisis hit and taxpayers bailed it out, its brand was considered top-notch. It ranked 14th worldwide among all corporations, according to Millward Brown BrandZ, a brand database. Today, Bank of America is 92nd, well behind rivals like Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.
No wonder Bank of America has become a punch line for Jay Leno. Last year, as protesters in Zuccotti Park waved signs disparaging the bank, even Brett Ratner's crime caper film, ''Tower Heist,'' took a shot: at one point, Eddie Murphy, posing as a banker, tells someone that if you want to wear a black leather hood and flagellate yourself, work at Bank of America.
The joke alluded to the bank's biggest business challenge, as well as its biggest P.R. headache: home mortgages. Five years after the housing market came unhinged, the bank still faces tens of billions of dollars in potential damages from lawsuits over mortgage investments that went bad, according to McCarthy Lawyer Links, a legal consulting firm. Most of those investments were sold by Countrywide Financial, the subprime mortgage giant it acquired amid the crisis. Bank of America and other lenders hope to cut a deal with state attorneys general over improper foreclosures.
Ms. Finucane isn't directly involved in the mortgage business or in the bank's legal decision making. But when a problem threatens the bank's reputation, it lands in her lap. Sensing the public's animosity toward banking, for instance, she persuaded Mr. Moynihan to eliminate overdraft fees on debit card purchases in 2010, and to reject those purchases instead. Other banks later introduced a less stringent version of that policy, prompted by new regulations. But she and Bank of America stumbled badly last fall with plans to impose a $5 monthly fee on customers who use debit cards for purchases. It was a P.R. disaster, and the bank quickly backpedaled.
In Florida in December, Mr. Clinton brought up the nation's mortgage mess at the private conference. He praised Bank of America's efforts to ease mortgage terms for some troubled homeowners but said the lingering housing troubles represented a chain around the nation's neck.
''We've got to do something to clean these books up, and to do it in a hurry, in my opinion,'' Mr. Clinton said. Stabilizing housing and dealing with foreclosures is vital for the entire economy, he contended. ''I still think that's the single most important thing we could do to loosen everyone up, go back to a free-market, full-employment economy and have the normal transactions occurring again,'' he said.
Ms. Finucane agreed. ''Sounds like we need a workout deal,'' she said flatly.
AS world financial centers go, Boston hardly ranks with New York, London or Tokyo. But Boston is Anne Finucane's hometown, a source of power and pride since her girlhood days nearby, in Newton. She grew up the fourth of six children in an Irish-American household. Her father, William, was a well-connected lawyer who represented the Boston Patriots (now the New England Patriots) and various local banks. Her mother, Mary, was a homemaker.
Before the days of blue states and red states, the Finucanes were as blue as they come. Ms. Finucane's mother was a distant cousin to Tip O'Neill, the Massachusetts Democrat who was House speaker from 1977 to 1987. Ms. Finucane still remembers the gown her mother wore to the inauguration of John F. Kennedy.
Valuable connections were made at a young age. A childhood friend was the daughter of Robert Q. Crane, then treasurer of Massachusetts. When the girls were in high school, Mr. Crane arranged a lunch for them with Kevin White, then Boston's mayor. It was at Anthony's Pier 4, a haunt of John Kennedy and Joe DiMaggio that overlooks Boston Harbor. And it was then that Ms. Finucane met Mr. Frank, then chief of staff for Mayor White.
''He was smart, funny, bombastic, dismissive -- all in, like, 5 minutes,'' Ms. Finucane recalls.
Partly because of that lunch, Ms. Finucane got a job in Mayor White's arts office, fresh out of the University of New Hampshire. Mr. Crane's daughter, Mary Lou, later introduced Ms. Finucane to Mike Barnicle, then a columnist at The Boston Globe. Mr. Barnicle, nine years her senior, had three children from a previous marriage. He was also famous in political and media circles, having worked for Robert F. Kennedy and Sargent Shriver. Before long, the couple married.
Tom Brokaw, the newscaster and a longtime friend, recalls thinking: '' 'Thank God for Anne,' because it's what Mike needed. In those days he was a cigar-chewing guy with a newspaper rolled in his back pocket. Anne was this elegant woman who moved through a lot of layers in Boston life.'' (Ms. Finucane and Mr. Barnicle have four grown children of their own.)
After her work in the mayor's office and a stint in local television, Ms. Finucane jumped to Hill Holiday, a Boston advertising agency, where she developed a flair for marketing. At one point, the agency conducted a study for Hyatt Hotels, aiming to distinguish between what customers said they wanted and what they really wanted.
The lesson, Ms. Finucane recalls, was this: Customers don't always know what they want. ''You may say you want a bathrobe and slippers,'' she says, ''but the truth is you really want a telephone in the bathroom.''
FEW friends would have predicted that Ms. Finucane would go into banking. But in 1995, she joined Fleet Financial as head of corporate affairs and marketing. She soon discovered how dangerous shoddy lending could be.
It turned out that Fleet had pushed high-risk and costly mortgages in the South. Georgia regulators eventually sued Fleet, accusing it of predatory lending; in 1993, the bank paid more than $100 million to settle the case.
From her perch in Boston, Ms. Finucane tried to isolate the subprime problem. ''I didn't want it to define the company,'' she recalls.
But the damage was lasting. ''We still remember how bad Fleet was,'' says Diane E. Thompson, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center in Boston. ''I think the general consensus is it was four or five years before it cleared from their brand for most people.''
Amid that storm, Ms. Finucane also began spending more time helping Fleet expand through acquisitions. Each deal was accompanied by delicate negotiations with local regulators and elected officials, many of whom worried that the mergers sweeping the industry would cost jobs and hurt consumers.
Ms. Finucane deftly allayed such fears, says Thomas Ryan, former chief of the CVS Corporation and, for years, a member of Fleet's and then Bank of America's boards.
''If we were buying a bank in Albany, she would meet with the mayor of Albany or the governor of New York and assure them about how we were going to operate the bank, what kind of people we'd hire,'' Mr. Ryan says. ''She knew the right people to talk to and the right message to give.''
By the late 1990s, Ms. Finucane and Mr. Barnicle had become fixtures in Boston society. They were often spotted at Fenway Park, cheering for the Red Sox. On Cape Cod, Ms. Finucane sailed with Edward M. Kennedy. When John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife, Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, died in a plane crash off Martha's Vineyard in 1999, Ms. Finucane and Mr. Barnicle offered support and counsel to the family.
Ms. Finucane also supported her husband in the late 1990s, when he was accused of plagiarizing George Carlin jokes. He resigned from The Globe in 1998 and is now a contributor at MSNBC.
But then Fleet, so long the predator, became the prey. In 2004, Bank of America, swooped in and bought it. The deal vaulted Ms. Finucane onto a national stage. She defended the merger in a contentious Congressional hearing, rebutting policy makers who warned that a handful of outsize institutions were coming to dominate banking.
Mr. Frank initially opposed the Fleet deal. But he changed his mind after Ms. Finucane personally assured him she would oversee Bank of America's pledge to safeguard local jobs. (The bank lived up to that pledge, but over all its mergers have cost the nation jobs -- unless the acquired companies would have failed without them.) The two have remained friends, though Ms. Finucane will soon lose her ally, at least in official circles: Mr. Frank has announced that he won't seek re-election.
After the Fleet deal, Ms. Finucane shepherded Mr. Lewis around Washington. But, uncomfortable inside the Beltway, Mr. Lewis often left high-level talks to her. Among other things, she lobbied to lift federal limits on the amount of deposits any one bank could hold, a restriction that kept big banks from getting bigger. She failed, although several banks, including hers, were able to get around the restriction during the financial crisis so they could buy troubled institutions.
As lawmakers moved to rein in banks after the crisis, Ms. Finucane urged Mr. Moynihan to throw his support behind the new Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. She also quietly promoted the bank's views to policy makers as they debated the Dodd-Frank bill that overhauled financial regulations. Once, after a Memorial Day parade in Wellesley, Mass., Mr. Frank ducked into the local library to meet with Ms. Finucane and Mr. Moynihan about the legislation.
Still, Ms. Finucane has not gained much traction in Washington of late. J. Steele Alphin, former chief administrative officer of Bank of America and, until his retirement in 2009, Ms. Finucane's direct boss, said the bank made a crucial miscalculation when it acquired Countrywide. Executives believed that they would score political points for preventing the failure of Countrywide, then one of the biggest mortgage lenders.
''We got none of that,'' Mr. Alphin says. Ms. Finucane, for her part, warned against the Countrywide deal, he says: ''She just felt strongly it was something the political world would get involved with and make hay with, and they did.''
In the end, Bank of America, via its acquisition of Countrywide, became a symbol of subprime excesses. It is still losing money on Countrywide loans and remains in the cross hairs of federal and state regulators.
CAN anyone pull Bank of America out of this quagmire? Ms. Finucane says it is vital to resolve the foreclosure crisis, an issue that angers millions of Americans.
''I can't tell you how serious this company is about dealing with these issues head-on and doing the right thing, but also fighting where we think we should,'' she said last week.
Over the last year, she has been meeting with borrower advocates to help develop a plan to appease the state attorneys general. According to people briefed on the matter, the plan would reduce the principal owed on some mortgages; it has been presented to the Justice Department and attorneys general.
Whether she will succeed is anyone's guess. But Martin Eakes, founder of the Center for Responsible Lending, praises Ms. Finucane for responding to his complaints about overdraft fees. ''The bank's decision was really a watershed event on the overdraft issue,'' Mr. Eakes says.
He says Bank of America probably lost $600 million by dropping that fee. But Ms. Finucane says the bank would be worse off, particularly in the public's eyes, if it hadn't taken the step.
''It's the right thing in the long term to have done,'' she says.
Yet Bank of America must please two constituencies that often seem at odds with each other. Ordinary Americans often complain that banks make money at their expense. But shareholders worry that banks aren't as profitable as they used to be. So Bank of America must figure out how to satisfy Wall Street while it restores its reputation.
So far, Bank of America -- ''the ''Bank of Opportunity,'' in Ms. Finucane's felicitous tag line -- has pleased neither camp.
''Banks aren't utilities, they're for-profit organizations,'' says Jason Goldberg, a bank analyst at Barclays, expressing the frustration of many bank investors. Bank of America's stock now trades at $6.61, having rebounded a bit from an unsettling decline to less than $5 in mid-December.
John F. Welch Jr., the former General Electric chief and a friend of Ms. Finucane's, says her equilibrium through good times and bad is remarkable. ''When BofA stock was $40, her ability to analyze issues coolly and collectively was the same as when BofA was $5.50,'' he says. ''She doesn't get into the vortex people in trouble get into -- this death vortex. She stays above the fray and observes it.''
DESPITE all the troubles -- the Occupy movement, the mortgage mess, the legal headaches, the restive stockholders and, yes, the jokes -- Ms. Finucane sounds remarkably optimistic. Then again, what else would the chief image officer say?
''Our brand will improve again as the economy shows improvement,'' Ms. Finucane wrote in a recent e-mail to two reporters for The New York Times, ''and as we continue to engage with our customers and our communities through national and local outreach, by listening and by delivering on what we do well and fixing what we don't have right.''
Ms. Finucane may be right. But it is also possible that this time, customers know what they want better than the company and its marketers.

HEADLINE: Evangelicals, Seeking Unity, Back Santorum

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM and JEFF ZELENY; Erik Eckholm reported from Brenham, Tex., and Jeff Zeleny from Mount Pleasant, S.C. Robbie Brown contributed reporting from Sumter, S.C.

 BODY:
BRENHAM, Tex. -- Evangelical leaders pursued a last-ditch effort on Saturday to exert influence in the Republican presidential primary race, voting to support the candidacy of Rick Santorum in hopes of undercutting Mitt Romney's march to the nomination.
A week before the South Carolina primary, a group of more than 100 influential Christian conservatives gathered at a ranch here and voted overwhelmingly to rally behind Mr. Santorum. An organizer described the vote as an ''unexpected supermajority,'' a decision that was intended to help winnow the Republican field and consolidate the opposition to Mr. Romney.
But the broader effect on the contest is less clear, particularly if the Republican field remains fractured. If the support had come earlier in the primary campaign, before Mr. Romney emerged as the leading candidate to beat, it could have had greater impact. In most surveys, Mr. Romney outpaces his rivals when respondents are asked who has the best chance of defeating President Obama.
Mr. Santorum, who fought Mr. Romney to a draw in the Iowa caucuses and has stirred enough concern in the eyes of a pro-Romney group to warrant a negative television ad in South Carolina, beamed when asked about the endorsement at a campaign stop on Saturday. 
''They've looked at not just what we've been able to accomplish during this primary season so far,'' Mr. Santorum told reporters in Mount Pleasant, S.C. ''But they've looked at the track record of someone that's been a strong, consistent voice across the board on all the conservative issues.''
Conservatives, after finding success in Congressional elections two years ago, are under significant pressure to reassert themselves in hopes of blunting the rise of Mr. Romney, who is derisively referred to by his opponents as a ''Massachusetts moderate.'' They openly question his consistency on social and fiscal conservatism.
Evangelical leaders, along with many other components of the conservative movement, have been fractured over the race, which contributed to Mr. Romney's success in Iowa and New Hampshire. But with time running short and Mr. Romney holding considerable advantages, the leaders sought to table their divisions and chose, by a wide margin, to support Mr. Santorum over Newt Gingrich or Gov. Rick Perry of Texas.
The extent to which those attending the meeting will be able to mobilize their followers behind Mr. Santorum remains unclear. The group's vote is not binding on participants and the leaders did not directly ask Mr. Gingrich or Mr. Perry to drop out of the race.
''There is a hope and an expectation that this will have an impact on South Carolina,'' Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council and a spokesman for the group, said in a telephone news conference after the private meeting concluded.
The decision here in Texas came on the eve of the final Sunday church services before the South Carolina primary on Saturday. Mr. Santorum said that he raised $3 million in the last week and expected that the support would likely help him raise even more money and strengthen his campaign organization in the state.
''People are trying to assess not just who's the most electable conservative, vis-a-vis Mitt Romney, but who's the most electable, period,'' Mr. Santorum said Saturday, adding that he was ''not going to call on anybody to drop out of the race.''
The moment that word spread about the decision in Texas, allies of Mr. Gingrich forcefully pushed back against the suggestion that Mr. Santorum won the group's support outright. They noted that many evangelical leaders remain firmly divided and have little sway over their congregations or members.
The power of the support for Mr. Santorum will be tested over the next seven days in South Carolina. In the Republican presidential primary there four years ago, exit polls found that 60 percent of voters said they considered themselves ''born again'' or evangelical Christians.
Evangelicals tend to be better informed and more independent that they were a generation ago, when the endorsement from a leader like Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson held huge sway, said Rev. Paul Jimenez, pastor of Taylors First Baptist Church in Greenville, S.C.
''People will take note of what the leaders say, but the days are gone when you could stand up and say this is our guy,'' said Mr. Jimenez, who previously worked in Washington for the late Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina. ''Evangelicals have so many voices now.''
But organizers of the Texas meeting said they expected to see new endorsements and fund-raising efforts for Mr. Santorum before Republicans in South Carolina vote on Saturday, followed by the Florida primary on Jan 31. Their hope is that if evangelicals unite around one candidate, they can head off the nomination of Mr. Romney, whom they regard as too moderate.
At a forum for Republican presidential candidates in Charleston, S.C., which was broadcast Saturday evening on the Fox News Channel, Mr. Romney refuted the suggestion that he had a moderate record as governor of Massachusetts. He told a woman who said she was an undecided voter, ''I don't know whether in a minute I can convince you, but I have a conservative record.''
Mr. Romney did not mention the decision by the evangelical leaders at a campaign stop Saturday afternoon. A spokeswoman declined to comment.
The meeting in Texas began Friday afternoon at the ranch of Paul and Nancy Pressler, who are longtime patrons of conservative causes. James C. Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family, Donald E. Wildmon, the founder of the American Family Association, and Mr. Perkins were among the organizers.
After an evening and a morning of what Mr. Perkins called ''cordial but passionate'' discussions, including presentations by advocates for each of the major candidates except former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. of Utah, the group held a series of three secret ballots.
The field was narrowed to Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich after the first vote. By the third ballot, Mr. Perkins said, 114 people voted, with Mr. Santorum receiving 85 votes to 29 for Mr. Gingrich.
Mr. Perkins declined to explain why participants moved toward Mr. Santorum, other than to praise his consistent record on social and economic issues. In the discussions, Mr. Perkins said, participants were as concerned about repealing Mr. Obama's health care law and fighting the national debt as they were about abortion and same-sex marriage.
And many evangelicals have said they are bothered not only by Mr. Gingrich's three marriages, but by his attacks on Mr. Romney's work in private equity, which they believe amounts to attacks on free enterprise.
In the interest of unity, Mr. Perkins said, some people who had previously supported Mr. Gingrich, or who were on the fence, switched to Mr. Santorum. But he added that perhaps a quarter of the participants continued to support Mr. Gingrich. Mr. Perkins stressed that participants would happily support Mr. Gingrich or Mr. Perry -- if they emerged victorious -- but he was less certain about Mr. Romney.
Rick Tyler, a longtime adviser to Mr. Gingrich who now runs a ''super PAC'' supporting the Gingrich campaign, dismissed the vote. He called it ''a straw poll that had questionable methodology.''
''Rick has a very good record on evangelical issues, but has no ability to beat Mitt Romney and less so for Barack Obama,'' Mr. Tyler said of Mr. Santorum. ''Endorsing Rick only serves to help Romney, who has a terrible record on the issues evangelicals care about.''
The shared goal, many participants said, was to see if it would be possible to unite conservative Christians around a single alternative to Mr. Romney and avoid repeating the experience of 2008, when their disarray helped Senator John McCain, whom they considered a moderate, to take the nomination.
''I think in the end,'' Mr. Perkins said, ''it was not so much what was wrong with one candidate but rather what was right about the one that people ended up rallying around.''

HEADLINE: Running From Millions

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
COLUMBIA, S.C.
FRESH from his triumph in New Hampshire, Mitt Romney bounded onto a stage here last week in a sport jacket, which was unusual for him, and an open collar and jeans, which are the norm. Casual dress is part of his financial camouflage. It doesn't scream $200 million man.
Voters aren't fooled. I checked with those assembled to hear his remarks, and even undecided ones who weren't fully familiar with him knew that he was rolling in it. They were also unsurprised by that.
''Isn't pretty much everybody who runs for president wealthy?'' said Wendy White, 49, a schoolteacher, making affluence in politics seem as foreordained as height in professional basketball -- which it almost is. ''In an ideal, utopian society, we'd like someone who knows what it's like to struggle as a teacher or a working mom. But Republican or Democrat, they always have money if they end up in the White House.'' 
And Republican or Democrat, they often go to laughable lengths to play that down. A recurring theme from just about every election cycle is the economic altitude of candidates who insist on playacting that they're less loftily removed from the so-called common man than they really are. Time and again we're treated to a comedy of manners with predictable pratfalls and a clear take-away: although there has long been a significant economic disparity between the rulers and the ruled, neither group can get entirely comfortable with it.
John McCain styled himself as a pomp-allergic enemy of big money in politics but hit a rough patch in 2008 when a reporter asked him how many homes he and his wife, Cindy, an heiress, owned. He had apparently lost count, because he couldn't come up with the answer: at least seven. According to some estimates, he was worth more than $36 million, not counting most of her fortune.
When John Kerry ran for president four years before that, he and Teresa Heinz Kerry, also an heiress, were worth about $750 million, according to numbers crunched by Forbes. He emphasized that it was her money, not his, and that he had lived modestly in the past. He wasn't living modestly any longer. He and his wife reportedly divided their time between five homes worth more than $30 million in aggregate, including retreats in Idaho for skiing and on Nantucket for sailing.
Romney, whose net worth is generally estimated to be $200 million, earned his money rather than marrying into it. But the precise way he earned it -- through Bain Capital, a corporate-takeover firm -- has come under fierce attack in advance of the Jan. 21 primary in South Carolina, where some of Bain's deals are said to have cost jobs, and unemployment is 9.9 percent.
To make matters more fraught, he's campaigning during a time of exaggerated income inequality and increasingly loud complaints about it. A survey released by the Pew Research Center last week showed that 66 percent of Americans consider the conflict between the haves and have-nots to be ''very strong'' or ''strong.'' In 2009, only 47 percent of respondents said that.
Romney's adjustment to that is a work in awkward progress. Last June, he told Florida voters that as a candidate, he, too, was essentially unemployed. He was kidding, but still.
He wasn't kidding last week when he told New Hampshire voters that he had begun his career ''at the entry level,'' as if the Harvard-educated son of a former governor and corporate chieftain grabs hold of the same first rung that others do. And he assured them that he had known the fear of ''a pink slip.'' They probably thought he was talking about lingerie.
He's almost uniquely clumsy with quips that draw inadvertent attention to his affluence. Bet you $10,000 you can't name someone clumsier.
That's a wager most of his current Republican rivals can afford. According to a breakdown by ABC News, Jon Huntsman Jr.'s net worth has been estimated to be about $50 million, while his father's is $900 million. Newt Gingrich's is close to $7 million, Rick Perry's about $3 million, Ron Paul's between $1.9 and $5.2 million and Rick Santorum's as much as $2 million, though in all cases it's hard to be sure or specific. Candidates file dollar ranges rather than exact figures to the Federal Election Commission, and only some elect to make their tax returns public.
The Republican field is no historic anomaly. Some of our richest presidents were our earliest ones. When The Atlantic two years ago researched presidents' wealth and adjusted their estimated net worth to 2010 dollars, it found that eight of the first 10 presidents were worth at least $20 million, and five of those men were worth more than $50 million, at least by the time they left office. George Washington led the pack, with $525 million, much of it courtesy of Martha, a widowed heiress.
In the second half of the 19th century, there was a stretch of presidents of humbler means, including Abraham Lincoln. But almost all 20th-century presidents were much richer than the average American.
Barack Obama didn't grow up well-off and remained relatively poor by presidential standards, but he and his wife reported a gross income of nearly $1 million in 2006 and had assets of between $2 million and $7.35 million by the end of 2007, when his presidential bid was under way. By then the Clintons were rich enough that Hillary, challenging Obama for the Democratic nomination, was able to lend her campaign $11 million of her own money.
The tens of millions it can take for a credible presidential primary campaign favors candidates with money, if only because they have the ability to abandon salaried jobs and stump. When Mike Huckabee begged off the 2012 presidential race, a lack of accrued wealth was one reason.
''If I run, I walk away from a pretty good income,'' he said, referring to his daily radio and weekly TV shows.
MORE important, candidates of means tend to have access to the sorts of rich people who can pump major money into super PACs. The principal one supporting Romney had already raised $12 million by last July.
Even many Congressional campaigns have grown drawn out and exorbitant. Is it any wonder, then, that Congress has become a wealthier club? As Eric Lichtblau reported in The Times recently, the median net worth of a member of Congress appeared to be $913,000 in 2010 and had grown 15 percent over six years. The median net worth for all Americans was about $100,000 and had declined 8 percent.
There's no simple relationship between privilege and policy. The Roosevelts and Kennedys, both spectacularly rich families, produced leaders known for their populism and protection of the less fortunate. Nancy Pelosi, a staunch defender of government aid, is thought to be worth as much as $196 million. John Boehner? Just $1.8 million, according to figures from 2010.
Wealth in politics makes a certain sense. The same drive, vanity, accomplishment and ingenuity that fuel a successful political career often fuel high earnings beforehand. And those earnings in some instances win voters' confidence.
Paul Friedman, 32, an undecided voter who showed up at Romney's event in Columbia, said, ''If we're talking about jobs, and his businesses are successful, then maybe he'd run the country in a way that brings jobs back.'' That's Romney's pitch.
But he walks a tightrope, wanting to broadcast his success without seeming out of touch. A wealthy candidate's aides guard against tone-deaf admissions of privilege while opponents itch to pounce, as the first President Bush's did in 1992, when he seemed unfamiliar with a grocery store's electronic price scanner.
I doubt many politicians at that stage of the game are spending much time in the checkout line or know the price of milk without seeing it on a briefing paper. But the charade persists. The second President Bush learned from his father's mistakes and seemed to develop an entire folksy persona in response. He spent vacations clearing brush, and though done on a vast Texas ranch purchased with his considerable wealth, it yielded optics preferable to those of John Kerry windsurfing.
Romney recalls the Naugahyde chair in an office past and tweets about breakfast at Subway and a flight on Southwest Airlines. But inevitably he muffs the script. During last Sunday's debate he said a man shouldn't run for office if he needed to win to pay the mortgage.
It wasn't a $10,000 flub. But it was rich.

HEADLINE: The Fraud of the Tea Party

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: It's obvious that governing was never the point. 

 BODY:
I see by the calendar that Congress is due back in session Tuesday, whatever that means. They've actually been in session - sorta, kinda, why not? - a parliamentary trick to prevent President Obama from naming people to keep the government running. But even that is in dispute.
Thus far, the Worst Congress Ever has done nothing but show that the United States can be a nonfunctioning democracy when it wants to, like Italy but with all-you-can-eat buffets. In a single demi-term, it nearly shut down the government, fouled a fledgling economic recovery with a pointless fight over the debt ceiling, and then threatened to withhold spending money for 160 million working Americans by raising the payroll tax. Brinkmanship is its only game.
Oh, but the House did pass a measure barring the government from encouraging use of energy-efficient light bulbs. "With a President Bachmann, Americans can buy any light bulb they want." So said Representative Michele Bachmann, until recently a candidate for president and a self-proclaimed leader of the Tea Party. You see how far she got.
It would be easy, using Bachmann and her Republican Party majority in the House as prime exhibits, to see the Tea Party as a collection of buffoons and know-nothings who have now run out of helium. But the movement, largely leaderless, was born out of legitimate frustration over Wall Street bailouts and runaway government spending. People in funny costumes made a lot of noise, and claimed responsibility for handing Republicans control of the House in the 2010 elections.
Now that they've had time to govern - an oxymoron in the Tea Party case - and have all but formally picked a presidential candidate, this crowd has shown its true colors. In theory, the Tea Party's calls for revolutionary pride and citizen power would jolt the sclerotic heart of Washington. In practice, the Tea Party has proved to be a fraud, betraying the professed ideals from which it sprang.
In the presidential race,Ron Paul, the daft, grandfatherly skinflint who wants to cut a trillion dollars in federal spending right off the top, should be leading the movement's parade. But polls in key primary states show that people who describe themselves as Tea Party members support Mitt Romney,Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum.
Each of the front-runners, in obvious ways, represents what the Tea Party hates. Romney, as is well known, is the founding father of Obamacare - the law requiring people to get health insurance, pioneered by him in Massachusetts. He supported the huge bailout of Wall Street, which passed all that downside capitalistic risk on to the rest of us. Hooray for the socialist from Bain Capital!
After 30 years at the fetid waters of power, Gingrich, of course, is the ultimate Washington insider, and he took $1.6 million from government-sponsored Freddie Mac, which Tea Partiers blame for the housing collapse.
And Santorum, during his 16 years in Congress, never met an earmark he could not support, from a bilingual health care studies program at a college in his home state to the infamous Bridge to Nowhere. Critics of big spending say he has requested more than $1 billion in earmarks during his time at the trough.
O.K., so people have to lower their sights. After all, getting rid of Obama is the ultimate goal for Tea Partiers, so they will settle for someone who isn't the best-looking guy at the dance, to use a Santorum line.
What about the actual members elected to Congress by the Tea Party movement? Among the showier freshmen, Representative Joe Walsh of Illinois has had trouble paying his child support and his back taxes, while hissing about fiscal irresponsibility. And Representative Allen West of Florida is known for comparing Democrats to Nazis.
In truth, the Tea Party gang never intended to govern, or - God forbid - compromise. They were birthed by Fox News and right-wing radio, where fact-challenged outrage is the blood that keeps the heart pumping.
The public, certainly, has soured on them, even in the reddest of states. A Pew poll in November of 60 districts represented by members of the House Tea Party caucus found that just 25 percent of constituents agreed with the goals of the group.
And because Republicans hitched their wagon to the Tea Party, they share the crash. More Americans identified themselves as independents, 40 percent in 2011, than in any year since Gallup began measuring party affiliation. Republicans were at 27 percent, and Democrats at 31 in that poll earlier this month.
As we approach one of the more clamorous elections in our history, some people are mystified that the Tea Party has disappeared. They shouldn't be. It was a media creation, and such things, whether Kardashian or political, never last.

HEADLINE: Huntsman Says He's Quitting G.O.P. Race

BYLINE: JIM RUTENBERG AND JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: Jon M. Huntsman Jr. informed his advisers on Sunday that he intends to drop out of the Republican presidential race, ending his candidacy a week before he had hoped to revive his campaign in the South Carolina primary. 

 BODY:
CHARLESTON, S.C. - Jon M. Huntsman Jr. will announce Monday that he is ending his bid for the Republican presidential nomination and endorsing Mitt Romney, narrowing the field and erasing a challenge to Mr. Romney from the moderate wing of his party.
Mr. Huntsman, who had hoped to use the South Carolina primary this week to revive his flagging candidacy, informed his advisers on Sunday that he was bowing to political reality and would back Mr. Romney, whom he accused a week ago of putting party ahead of country.
Mr. Huntsman, who had struggled to live up to the early expectations of his candidacy, was to deliver a speech Monday morning in Myrtle Beach, where the five remaining major Republican candidates will gather hours later for a debate. His endorsement of Mr. Romney is indication of the party establishment getting behind Mr. Romney and trying to focus the party on defeating President Obama.
"The governor and his family, at this point in the race, decided it was time for Republicans to rally around a candidate who could beat Barack Obama and turn around the economy," Matt David, Mr. Huntsman's campaign manager, said in an interview Sunday evening. "That candidate is Gov. Mitt Romney."
But Mr. Huntsman's decision was unlikely to have any particular influence where Mr. Romney needs it most, among social and religious conservatives who remain wary of Mr. Romney's ideological inconsistency. With the withdrawal of Mr. Huntsman, who despite his efforts to portray himself as more conservative than Mr. Romney was often viewed as the moderate in the race, the South Carolina primary is now Mr. Romney against an array of opponents coming at him from the right.
Mr. Romney faces challenges from Rick Santorum, the former senator from Pennsylvania, and Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker. Also on the ballot in South Carolina are Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who has shown few signs of attracting a following here, and Ron Paul, the libertarian-leaning congressman from Texas.
Both Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich are hoping for strong enough showings here to go on as the main alternatives to Mr. Romney. After months in which social conservatives have been fractured, Mr. Santorum is trying to energize his candidacy in the wake of a vote by evangelical leaders over the weekend to back him.
It was a disappointing finale to the high-flying presidential aspirations of Mr. Huntsman.
A third-place finish in the New Hampshire primary last week failed to jump-start his candidacy, aides said, and his campaign limped into South Carolina with little money. Mr. Huntsman had spent days pondering his future in the race, and aides said he told them on Sunday that he was unlikely to topple Mr. Romney or match the momentum of his Republican rivals in the conservative Southern primary.
Mr. Huntsman and Mr. Romney had been competing for similarly moderate voters, and aides said he had come to the realization that he had little chance to win and that the votes he would receive would come from Mr. Romney's potential voter pool.
To the extent that Mr. Huntsman had the support of those moderate Republican voters, his departure from race removes any competition for that segment of the party's electorate, giving Mr. Romney breathing room to focus even more on persuading evangelical voters who have been cooler to his candidacy that he is the more electable candidate in November.
Yet late Sunday evening, a spokesman for Mr. Gingrich sought to portray the decision by Mr. Huntsman as a boon to him, saying in a statement, "We are one step closer to a bold Reagan conservative winning the G.O.P. nomination."
The decision from Mr. Huntsman came on the same day that he received the endorsement from The State, the newspaper in the capital, Columbia. He had campaigned in South Carolina over the weekend, not giving any indication that the end was near.
While Mr. Romney and Mr. Huntsman were both here in Charleston, aides said the two men had not spoken Sunday evening. When approached at a downtown restaurant here, a table of senior advisers to Mr. Romney declined to discuss the endorsement.
"No comment," said Eric Fernstrom, an aide. ""But the bread pudding is outstanding." On Monday morning, Mr. Romney and Mr. Huntsman were scheduled to speak.
Mr. Huntsman first signaled his presidential ambitions here in South Carolina in May, days after returning from Beijing, where he had been the United States ambassador to China. He surrounded himself with a roster of veteran advisers who positioned Mr. Huntsman as a new brand of Republican.
He formally announced his candidacy in June, in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty, calling for a more civil kind of presidential campaign and promising a better future than the one that Mr. Obama would provide.
"He and I have a difference of opinion on how to help a country we both love," Mr. Huntsman said of Mr. Obama. "But the question each of us wants the voters to answer is who will be the better president, not who's the better American."
But the campaign of "civility, humanity and respect" that Mr. Huntsman promised quickly faded into the background as his Republican rivals seized the attention - and the support - of a party faithful that seemed more interested in red-meat politics.
Voters also seemed wary of a candidacy by a person whose most recent service was to the very man he now wanted to oust. Fawning letters that Mr. Huntsman wrote about Mr. Obama's leadership did not help that case.
For months, Mr. Huntsman languished near the bottom in the national polls and eventually gave up on competing in Iowa. He moved his campaign headquarters to Florida, betting that he could wait until that primary to make his move.
But as the first contests got closer, Mr. Huntsman made the decision to move his campaign to New Hampshire, where he hoped that the presence of independent voters would help his chances. Mr. Huntsman did better in New Hampshire than polls might have suggested, but he came in a distant third behind Mr. Romney and Mr. Paul.
But Mr. Obama's top advisers seemed to see the danger in Mr. Huntsman's candidacy, signaling in 2009 that they thought he might be a strong contender.

HEADLINE: An Unexpected Focus Before the Next Primary

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican primary candidates competing with Mitt Romney have pushed aside social issues to attack him on his days at Bain Capital. 

 BODY:
The Republican battle for South Carolina was supposed to have been a time for the state's socially conservative voters to weed out the candidates they found unfit. Instead, the primary has been dominated by a loud and unruly argument over whether Bain Capital, the private equity firm that was led by Mitt Romney, drove companies out of business and put people out of work while enriching itself with billions of dollars.
That has pushed aside issues like abortion, gun rights and same-sex marriage, and, so far, has muddied the effort for conservatives to coalesce around a single candidate with credentials they might find acceptable.
Attacks on Mr. Romney by Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry have prompted a furious backlash among some in the Republican establishment - a reflection of pragmatic concern about the long-term impact on the party's likeliest nominee and of indignation that the criticisms were a betrayal of the Republican belief in unfettered free enterprise. On Sunday, both Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Perry refused to disavow their attacks.
The next five days could be crucial as the candidates gather again to debate, first on Monday and then on Thursday. The debates will serve either as nationally televised forums for more attacks on Mr. Romney's business background or as a new opportunity for a more direct appeal to conservatives on social issues.
Here is a rundown of how the candidates have fared in the debate over Bain Capital, and how the subject might play out for them in the days ahead:
NEWT GINGRICH The decision to attack Mr. Romney's work at Bain Capital has given Mr. Gingrich's campaign new life after he finished in fourth place in New Hampshire. It drew the news media spotlight back to his campaign, giving him an opportunity to make his case as the best alternative to Mr. Romney.
But the attacks also allowed many to question Mr. Gingrich's motives and tactics. By this weekend, he was on the defensive for inaccuracies in an anti-Romney film being used in commercials by a pro-Gingrich "super PAC."
He said any inaccuracies should be corrected but refused to condemn the ads. Will voters hold him accountable for the commercials? Or will they buy into his argument that Mr. Romney would be too easily defeated by President Obama in the fall?
MITT ROMNEY The Bain Capital attacks have succeeded in putting Mr. Romney on the defensive just when he had hoped to capitalize on his victory in New Hampshire. His campaign was forced to run a new ad in South Carolina defending his work at Bain and citing companies that Bain helped to succeed.
But the attacks could persuade conservatives to rally behind Mr. Romney. Chris Chocola, the head of the conservative Club for Growth, who is not usually a fan of Mr. Romney's positions, came to his defense on Sunday, comparing Mr. Gingrich's argument to that of the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore.
RICK PERRY There is little evidence that Mr. Perry's decision to join in the Bain attacks have worked as effectively for him. His attacks were more quotable - he called Mr. Romney a "vulture" capitalist - but he has not had any significant money to broadcast ads making his argument.
RICK SANTORUM By refusing to engage in the criticism of Mr. Romney's time at Bain Capital, Mr. Santorum may hope to earn the support of voters who say, "A pox on both their houses."
It might work, but the Bain argument has complicated Mr. Santorum's efforts in South Carolina by muting the debate about social issues. The vote to support Mr. Santorum by a group of influential evangelical leaders in Texas on Saturday might help tilt the conversation back to those issues. But look for Mr. Santorum to bring them up even more in the debates.
RON PAUL The Bain conversation has made Mr. Paul all but invisible in South Carolina after having had some success in New Hampshire. He has continued running his typical campaign - talking about monetary policy, liberty and the need to draw back from foreign entanglements.
Mr. Paul is likely to receive support from his core supporters in South Carolina - students and libertarians.
But the state, with its large military community, is likely to be a less friendly place for his arguments about foreign policy than were New Hampshire and Iowa.

HEADLINE: What the Right Gets Right

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: Leading liberal thinkers reveal what they like about contemporary conservatism. 

 BODY:
With the competitors for the Republican presidential nomination engaged in an intriguing and unexpected debate over the dangers of capitalism's "creative destruction", this is the appropriate moment to explore the question: What does the right get right?
What insights, principles, and analyses does this movement have to offer that liberals and Democrats might want to take into account?
I recently posed a question to conservative think tanks: If given a free hand, how would conservatives deal with the unemployed, those dependent on government benefits (food stamps, Medicaid), and, more generally, those who are losers in the new economy - those hurt by corporate restructuring, globalization and declining manufacturing employment?
The Heritage Foundation, rather than answer the question, sent me links to the following papers: "Extended Unemployment Insurance Payments Do Not Benefit the Economy," "A Free Enterprise Prescription: Unleashing Entrepreneurs to Create Jobs," "Confronting the Unsustainable Growth of Welfare Entitlements: Principles of Reform and the Next Steps," and "An Effective Washington Jobs Program: Do Less Harm."
A conservative policy intellectual from a different think tank sent me an email suggesting that I read Paul Ryan's budget proposal, "The Path to Prosperity: Restoring America's Promise."
All the answers evaded the question posed and, in my view, amounted to ideological pap.
I decided it might be better to ask liberals what they liked about conservatism. I submitted a new question to a small group of academics and activists on the left: what does the right get right?
The answers they gave describing the strengths the right has were illuminating and help to explain why the Republican Party has won seven of the last eleven presidential elections; controlled the Senate from 1981 to 1987 and from 1995 to 2007; and controlled the House from 1996 to 2006 and 2011 to 2013.
Andy Stern, former president of the Service Employees International Union (one of our era's few highly successful labor organizations) and now a senior fellow at Columbia University's Richman Center, made five points about conservatives in an email to me:
"They appreciate more instinctively the need for fiscal balance."
"They understand people's more innate belief in hard work and individual responsibility and see government as too often lacking that understanding."
"They are more suspicious from a philosophical point of view of big government as an answer to many issues and are suspicious of Wall Street institutionally and not just their high salaries, and bad practices."
"They respect the need for private sector economic growth (although their prescription is lacking)."
"They are more pro-small business."
Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California at San Diego, is the author of "A Divider, Not a Uniter," a harsh critique of the presidency of George W. Bush, whom Jacobson treats as a conservative apostate. Genuine conservatism, in Jacobson's view, has a number of strengths:
It recognizes "the importance of material incentives in shaping behavior, and the difficulty in keeping bureaucracies under control and responsive to citizens."
It is skeptical of "the application of social science theories to real world problems" and cognizant of "human fallibility/corruptibility."
It places a high value on "liberty/autonomy."
It places a similarly high value on "good parenting."
It acknowledges "the superiority of market systems for encouraging efficient use of resources."
Jonathan Haidt, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, is a liberal Democrat who has spent much of the past decade exploring the competitive strengths of conservatism. In his new book, "The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion," which will be published in March, Haidt makes several points. Conservatives, he argues, "are closer to traditional ideas of liberty" like "the right to be left alone, and they often resent liberal programs that use government to infringe on their liberties in order to protect the groups that liberals care most about."
"Everyone gets angry when people take more than they deserve. But conservatives care more," Haidt writes. And social conservatives favor a vision of society "in which the basic social unit is the family, rather than the individual, and in which order, hierarchy, and tradition are highly valued."
What's more, conservatives
detect threats to moral capital that liberals cannot perceive. They do not oppose change of all kinds (such as the Internet), but they fight back ferociously when they believe that change will damage the institutions and traditions that provide our moral exoskeletons (such as the family). Preserving those institutions and traditions is their most sacred value.
Haidt is sharply critical of some aspects of liberalism. Liberals' determination to help victims often leads them "to push for changes that weaken groups, traditions, institutions, and moral capital." For example, "the urge to help the inner-city poor led to welfare programs in the 1960s that reduced the value of marriage, increased out-of-wedlock births, and weakened African American families," he suggests. "It's as though liberals are trying to help a subset of bees (which really does need help) even if doing so damages the hive."
Haidt, Jacobson and Stern described the positive or "flattering" view of conservatism; they were not asked about their opinions of conservatism's shortcomings.
Much of the 2012 general election campaign will be taken up by the struggle between Obama and Romney - and, more broadly, between Democrats and Republicans - to define conservatism and the Republican Party in either favorable or hostile terms.
Two scholars, Philip E. Tetlock, professor of management and psychology at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, and Gregory Mitchell, a professor of law at the University of Virginia, have done provocative and useful work analyzing the pluses and minuses of liberalism and conservatism.
In "Liberal and Conservative Approaches to Justice: Conflicting Psychological Portraits," Tetlock and Mitchell argue that the liabilities of conservatism include the following:
"Conservatives are too prone to engage in zero-sum thinking (either I keep my money or the government takes it). They fail to appreciate the possibility of positive sum solutions to social conflicts."
Conservatives hold "the laissez-faire 'minimal-state' view that, although we have a moral obligation to refrain from hurting others, we have no obligation to help others. Conservatives cling to the comforting moral illusion that there is a sharp distinction between allowing people to suffer and making people suffer."
"Conservatives fail to recognize that even if each transaction in a free market meets their standards of fairness (exchanges between competent adults who have not been coerced or tricked into contracts), the cumulative results could be colossally unfair."
"Conservatives do not understand how prevalent situational constraints on achievement are and thus commit the fundamental attribution error when they hold the poor responsible for poverty."
"Conservatives overgeneralize: From a few cases of poor persons who exploit the system, they draw sweeping conclusions about all poor persons."
"Chance happenings play a much greater role in success or failure than conservatives realize. People often do not control their own destinies."
The tensions between 'good' and 'bad' conservatism have already surfaced in the controversy over the corporate acquisition practices of Bain Capital when Mitt Romney was C.E.O. Both Romney and the firm are proponents of capitalism's "gale of creative destruction." The question is, has Bain produced enough creation to justify the destruction?
The ideological war has begun in earnest, even a little early. It pits the right, seeking to depict a conservatism that is essentially good and a liberalism that is essentially bad, against a left attempting just the opposite. Looked at another way, the two sides are fighting over what the role of government in redistributing resources from the affluent to the needy should and shouldn't be.
While neither Romney nor Obama fits comfortably into the role of doctrinaire standard bearer, they have both been shaped by political and economic pressures that have forced them into philosophical confrontation. Political campaigns, especially re-election campaigns, are highly ideological, and this one will be no exception as the nominees try to determine the direction the country will take over the next decade.

HEADLINE: In Silicon Valley, the Ripe Scent of New Money

BYLINE: EVELYN M. RUSLI and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The start-up boom means there are more freshly minted millionaires looking to manage their wealth. And Wall Street firms are happy to help, for a fee. 

 BODY:
PALO ALTO, Calif. - Sam Odio expected a few congratulatory e-mails when he sold Divvyshot, his online photo-sharing service, to Facebook last April for millions of dollars.
Instead, his in-box was flooded with pitches from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other Wall Street firms looking to manage his newfound wealth. Goldman has the inside track, having courted him with an exclusive factory tour of Tesla, the electric sports-car maker, and tickets to a screening of the final Harry Potter film.
"They sure know the way to a geek's heart," said Mr. Odio, 27.
Wall Street, as always, is going where the money is - and right now that is Silicon Valley. The latest Internet boom means there are more newly minted millionaires, and even billionaires, than at any time since the technology bubble a decade ago.
Many are brilliant young entrepreneurs and computer engineers. But for all their knowledge, the technology executives, many of whom are fresh out of college, are relatively clueless when it comes to estate planning.
"Betting the ranch on building a widget for the Facebook platform is very different than managing a long-term nest egg," said Jay Backstrand, a vice president at JPMorgan Chase's private bank.
Wall Street is more than happy to help - for a fee. Banks charge roughly 1 percent for overseeing a wealthy investor's portfolio. Though that may not sound like a lot, it adds up when billions of dollars are involved.
Financial firms are salivating over the wealth being created. Facebook is readying an initial public offering that will most likely value it near $100 billion. Employees and directors at Zynga own more than a third of the online game company, which went public in December at $7 billion. The list of prospects is long: Groupon is worth $12.2 billion; LinkedIn, $6.8 billion; and Pandora, $1.9 billion.
Banks are casting a wide net for potential clients. At Facebook, Wall Street brokers are wooing executives, rank-and-file employees and administrative staff members. Morgan Stanley has a dual strategy, with one team of advisers responsible for senior executives at large technology start-ups and another for lower-level employees. Chris Dupuy, who leads Merrill Lynch's wealth management team in the Pacific Northwest, recruits from the C-Suite to the "corporate cafeteria."
"Someone's going to capture this wealth," said Derek Fowler, a wealth adviser at Morgan Stanley. "We just want to make sure we're out there."
Banks are aggressively expanding in Northern California, even as they retrench globally. JPMorgan opened a 10,000-square-foot office in Palo Alto, Calif., a hub of venture capital activity. Goldman, which is eliminating some 1,000 jobs worldwide, plans to increase staff in San Francisco by 30 percent over the next year. UBS has more than doubled its wealth management staff in the area since 2008. "It's very competitive," said Joseph A. Camarda, who relocated from Philadelphia to lead Goldman's wealth management group in San Francisco. "I think every firm has an A-list team out here."
This feeding frenzy is familiar to those who experienced the last Internet boom. In the late 1990s, Wall Street descended on Silicon Valley, luring clients from marquee names like Yahoo and eBay. But after scouting clients from start-ups that flopped when the bubble burst in 2000, some banks pulled back.
This time, banks seem more aggressive. With start-ups growing faster than ever before because of developments in computing technology, it is critical to build relationships early. The emergence of secondary exchanges has allowed employees to sell shares before companies go public. Google, Facebook and other Internet giants are snapping up start-ups to spur growth, turning founders into overnight millionaires.
Geoff Lewis, the co-founder and chief executive of TopGuest, a mobile application acquired by ezRez Software in December, said he was surprised by the banks' persistence. He was contacted by Goldman, UBS and Merrill within hours of the deal's announcement.
"One bank, when I didn't respond, asked if I'd like to attend a Sharks game with one of their managing directors to get to know them better," Mr. Lewis said. He passed.
Advisers often tap existing clients for prospects and also scour industry sites, like TechCrunch or AllThingsD. The professional social network LinkedIn is an indispensable tool, with its database of start-up employees.
Personal connections matter, too. Andy Ellwood, an executive at Gowalla. a mobile application, received several e-mails when the service was sold to Facebook in December. But Goldman had already been in touch for months, after a broker met Mr. Ellwood's girlfriend at a book club.
"In the middle of a lot of things going on, I didn't want to deal with an overly aggressive sales person," he said. "It was nice to know that there's a friendly adviser, just a phone call away."
But Silicon Valley's culture of flip-flops and T-shirts represents a challenge to Wall Street's staid, button-down brokers. Mutual funds and other investments don't typically appeal to entrepreneurs, who often use spare funds to finance other start-ups.
Travis Kalanick, a co-founder of Uber, an on-demand car service, hired a broker a few years ago. But he grew skeptical after the adviser suggested a complicated investment that would make money only if a stock index fell within a narrow range.
"I felt like I was walking into a casino, where the dealer knew more than I did," said Mr. Kalanick, who eventually left the brokerage firm.
Banks have been slow to adopt the latest technological innovations, which could make for a tougher sell in Silicon Valley. Neither Morgan Stanley nor Goldman has an iPad application for clients to manage their portfolio. 
But Wall Street is trying to adapt its strategy.
Merrill executives are seeking advice from company employees under 30 on how to shape pitches. Barclays is pairing older wealth managers with young associates, who tend to be more familiar with social media.
"There are insights that one generation has - about technology, social media, networking - that another one may not fully appreciate," said Mitch Cox, head of the Americas for Barclays' private wealth management arm.
With a younger clientele, informational sessions focus on the basics, including buying a first home, paying off debt or building a portfolio. Last year, a Merrill adviser met with a start-up employee in her 20s who brought along her parents. They discussed going to grad school or buying a home.
Merrill offers "boot camps," that explain fundamentals like mutual funds and dividends. The firm is building such a program for Facebook employees timed to the I.P.O., according to people briefed on the plans.
"It's a big business opportunity," said Greg Vaughan, a managing director at Morgan Stanley's Menlo Park office. "There's a lot of wealth being created out here."

HEADLINE: Rooting for the Little Guy

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD and CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
Harold Pollack used to spend $1,000 a year on Amazon, but this fall started buying from small online retailers instead. The prices are higher, but Dr. Pollack says he now has a clear conscience.
''I don't feel they behave in a way that I want to support with my consumer dollars,'' Dr. Pollack, a professor in Chicago, said of the big Internet retailers.
Giant e-commerce companies like Amazon are acting increasingly like their big-box brethren as they extinguish small competitors with discounted prices, free shipping and easy-to-use apps. Big online retailers had a 19 percent jump in revenue over the holidays versus 2010, while at smaller online retailers growth was just 7 percent.
The little sites are fighting back with some tactics of their own, like preventing price comparisons or offering freebies that an anonymous large site can't. And in a new twist, they are also exploiting the sympathies of shoppers like Dr. Pollack by encouraging customers to think of them as the digital version of a mom-and-pop shop facing off against Walmart: If you can't shop close to home, at least shop small. 
''Folks are exercising their desire to support local stores where local is not just in their town, but anywhere in the country,'' said Michael Walden, a professor who studies regional economics at North Carolina State University. ''A large number of Americans have a general suspicion of bigness in the economic world -- they equate bigness with power, monopoly.''
Lacy Simons, owner of Hello Hello Books in Maine, a small store with an e-commerce site, says she is seeing customers ''cement their determination to shop local'' -- which on the Internet, means shopping at the smaller vendors -- even when the big sites offer lower prices.
''We know there's only so much that we can do to compete against them, so you end up relying on what hopefully becomes an emotional or personal connection with the retailer online,'' Ms. Simons said.
The battle between supersites and small online retailers became pitched this holiday season, as the big sites raked in the money. In November and December, the 25 biggest online retailers, including Amazon.com, Target.com and Walmart.com, received 70 percent of e-commerce dollars spent, an increase of three percentage points over last year, comScore said.
Amazon, the world's biggest Internet retailer, has been the leader in aggressive promotions that small sites can't afford to match -- and has received the most criticism.
This holiday season, Amazon offered price cuts on almost all holiday gifts; it can do this in part because of its size and profits from other businesses, like cloud computing, analysts said. The company offered free overnight shipping on thousands of items, and advertised its price-checking app by giving shoppers 5 percent off items on Amazon that they scanned in a store.
Amazon says it is giving consumers what they want. But the price-check promotion drew special ire; Senator Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine, called it ''an attack on Main Street businesses.''
It is contributing to ''a reputation as a bully,'' said Sucharita Mulpuru, an e-commerce analyst at Forrester Research. Reflecting that, in a reaction similar to what occurs when Walmarts open in small towns, some consumers say they will not support supersites any longer. But the economics of that decision are not always sound, said Professor Walden of North Carolina State. If a small site is selling products from a national manufacturer, for example, to people scattered around the nation, it has little effect on local vitality, he said.
Dr. Pollack, the Chicago professor, says that even if he is not supporting Chicago retail with his online purchases, he is not supporting what he calls big business's bullying ways.
Emily Powell, the chief executive of Powell's Books in Portland, Ore., which has an e-commerce store, said she attracts some shoppers with similar attitudes. ''People come because they want to support an independent and feel good about it,'' she said, but especially in a recession, ''you can only guilt people into coming to you for so long.''
That's where the other strategies kick in.
Some stores respond by carrying exclusive items at their sites. Powell's Books, for example, offers a subscription service through which it chooses a new book and includes an extra item like a related book or candy -- personalized touches that it says big sites can't match.
Other sites try to play hardball by refusing to carry what the big stores do, among other tactics.
''What I can't compete with is one day, for whatever reason, Amazon will suddenly drop a price below wholesale cost,'' said Ali Wing, the founder of the baby store Giggle. She has stopped carrying products, including a car seat and certain toys, when she can no longer compete. ''I won't take that brand damage and have you have a reason to think that Giggle is expensive.''
Lori Andre, owner of Lori's Shoes, an online and physical store based in Chicago, is asking vendors to give the shoes that Lori's carries different model names than it gives other stores, or to put a different label inside, so shoppers can't compare prices with a Zappos. (That may not win over shoppers; Best Buy, when it created its own labels to prevent in-store price checks on electronics, drew criticism from consumers.)
Lesley Tweedie, the co-owner of Roscoe Village Bikes in Chicago, introduced an online marketplace for small retailers, Little Independent. ''There's been a response from people who value a different style of shopping,'' she said.
Ms. Tweedie was so annoyed when she saw consumers using smartphone apps in her store that she began a ''Buy It Where You Try It'' campaign on Twitter and Facebook.
''I can't tell you how often that happens in the store, where someone is asking my advice and then actually says out loud, 'I wonder if I could find this on Amazon,' '' she said. ''I think that some people never really thought about the ethics.''
Amazon said it is helping small online businesses stay afloat by allowing them to sell on Amazon, through its Marketplace program, and take advantage of Amazon's large customer base, technology and marketing. Sellers pay a percentage of revenue in return.
''For a lot of these small and medium businesses, this isn't something they would be able to scale up and provide themselves,'' said Peter Faricy, general manager of Amazon Seller Services. He added that third-party sellers' items were included in promotions like Price Check.
Yet some small retailers with e-commerce sites say that no matter what consumers say, supersites' prices are just unmatchable.
Mike Stewart opened Feather & Fly, a sporting-goods store in Chattanooga, Tenn., eight years ago. As online stores started to pull away his customers, Mr. Stewart began selling some products on the Web.
Online, he found, ''there's no way I could compete against a big-box type store that could have massive inventories or cut deals to get better rates,'' he said.
''We did have good customer loyalty here,'' said Mr. Stewart, as he boxed up the inventory left over after his going-out-of-business sale, ''but the Internet is a killer.''

HEADLINE: Relations With Officers in a Crime-Ridden Precinct Are Plagued by Distrust

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS; Al Baker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Larry Petersen's mother brought him up to be polite. So last week when he saw two police officers in the hallway of his apartment building at the Linden Houses in East New York, Brooklyn, he greeted them with a ''hi.''
In response, Mr. Petersen said, he got a dirty look and then a head-to-toe once-over from the officers. ''They asked me, 'What are you doing?' '' he recalled. He was on his way to work. 
The officers, he said, were white. Mr. Petersen, 48, graying around his temples, is black. ''They looked at me as if the first thing they thought was that I was a perp,'' he said.
Mr. Peterson shrugged, familiar with such a dialogue of distrust between neighbors and police officers during his two decades of living in the housing development in the 75th Precinct, arguably the most violent in New York.
On Friday, the day after a police officer shot and killed a resident while responding to a call about an armed robbery across the street from Mr. Petersen's apartment, that fractured dialogue was the topic of conversation -- not just among the 4,000 residents of the Linden Houses, but also among leaders working to improve relationships with the police.
Residents ranging in age from their 20s to their 70s said that they occasionally felt harassed by the police or that they had often witnessed officers stop and frisk teenagers in the complex. One woman recounted seeing officers every morning in the courtyard, sitting as cold as stone, not engaging in conversation. One 42-year-old man wondered aloud whether in his precinct officers would shoot first and ask questions later.
The police, residents acknowledged, have an incredibly tough job in the economically depressed neighborhood. In 2011, the sprawling 75th Precinct had the most murders, 27, and the most robberies, 780, of any precinct in the city, figures that are still drastically lower than they were even 20 years ago.
''We can't think all of them are bad, and they can't think all of us are bad,'' Mr. Petersen said. ''But nobody has the time or the patience or the wisdom to say: 'You know what? Let's sit down and talk before we actually draw action.' ''
About 4 a.m. Friday, a few days after Mr. Petersen was confronted by the police, he was returning from an overtime shift as an electrician for American Airlines when he saw the police vehicles that had gathered after the police-involved shooting. He went to bed, accustomed to the scene, glad his family was safe.
Deidra Morse, 32, recalled hearing the gunshot from her eighth-floor window overlooking the two-story house on Schenck Avenue where a robbery in progress was reported to 911 on Thursday night.
''Here we go again,'' she thought, and she went to sleep.
Ms. Morse said she generally avoids the police. ''When you see them, you cross the street,'' she said. ''They have a bad reputation. I don't get into trouble, so I don't deal with them.''
Another young woman in the building's lobby said she did not feel comfortable talking to the police. She would not give her name, wary of the authorities. ''If we can't trust them,'' she said, ''who can we call in an emergency?''
''Everyone complains to me about the Police Department, that when you call, you become the victim, so you don't want to call,'' said Alberto Ramos, 56, the president of an advisory group for the precinct. ''The N.Y.P.D. is there for the community. I am trying to bridge this gap.''
Erica Perez, 31, the secretary of the 75th Precinct's community council, suggested that East New Yorkers attend three monthly meetings to get to know their officers, of whom 150 are rookies, she said.
''If you don't build a relationship, there's always going to be mistrust,'' Ms. Perez said.
Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, said that new officers assigned to the 75th Precinct, like all others in the city, undergo immersion training to community sensibilities.
He said that black clergy members in Brooklyn also work with local precincts at reducing gang involvement and contribute to a Police Department program that works with juveniles from housing projects after their first arrests for robbery.
''Police stops are, at a minimum, inconvenient, and it's not surprising that they generate resentment even when done courteously,'' Mr. Browne said in an e-mail on Sunday. ''Their primary beneficiary, however, have been young men of color who remain disproportionately the principal victims of gun violence -- over 90 percent of its victims.''
This police practice of stop and frisk, which statistics show is especially aggressive in East New York, has worsened the tension, residents say. According to the New York Civil Liberties Union, from 2006 to 2010, the 75th Precinct had the highest number of stops in the city. There were 26,938 such stops in 2010, and 75 percent of the people stopped were black.
''They come and violate your rights,'' Mujaheed Simmons, 45, said. ''You should see how many kids they stop around here just to check them.''
Heightening the distrust, Mr. Simmons said, is that many of the police officers seem not to live within the precinct boundaries. ''My father used to tell me that in the old days, the cops lived with their neighbors,'' he said.
An officer who was shot and killed on duty in East New York last month, Peter J. Figoski, had dedicated 22 years to the 75th Precinct; he lived on Long Island.
''It was sad what happened with Officer Figoski, and maybe they went in more guns ready because of what happened last time,'' Ms. Perez said, referring to the shooting on Thursday night. ''I know the community is outraged, but maybe they need to come and voice their concerns at the meeting.''

HEADLINE: The Met Reimagines the American Story

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
Right on time for the election year, American art has reoccupied the Metropolitan Museum of Art en masse. After four years of renovation the museum's galleries of American painting and sculpture -- long the most popular part of its now completely reopened American Wing -- will be back on view on Monday, washed with light, rich with stories and scenic prospects, and packed with enough politics to fuel any presidential campaign.
Economic inequities? The environment? Family values? Immigration? A nation at war, and at war with itself? It's all there, along with a population of hawks, tree-huggers and 1-percenters, in images that make up one of the finest collections of American art.
How do the updated galleries look? Sensational, which is news, because the old ones didn't. They had a warehouse atmosphere, with pictures stacked up on the walls, sculpture plunked down wherever and narrative logic disrupted because the collection was split between two floors. Now all the galleries are on one floor, the second. And, thanks to an addition of 3,300 feet of repurposed space, there are more of them, 26 in all. 
More space wouldn't mean much if it weren't well used, but it is. The architects, Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates, have devised a wrap-around format with a few long-vista galleries cutting through a maze of smaller ones. The art placement is roughly chronological, but also coalesces into themes, and leaves choice of direction mostly up to the visitor. If you see something beckoning from another gallery, go for it. There are no wrong turns here.
Still, an installation has to start somewhere. In this case it's in 18th-century New England, with an array of portrait paintings, including eight by John Singleton Copley. Copley was a Boston boy, born there in 1738, and ambitious. He yearned to do history paintings, the prestige genre of the day. But there was little call for these in the Colonies, so he settled for portraiture, seeking out an elite Yankee clientele. He found one. They loved him. You can see why.
Copley was a superb technician with an avid eye for particulars: the crinkle of silk on a sleeve, the reflection of fruit on a polished tabletop, the distinguishing mole on an alpha chin. He may not have made homely sitters beautiful, but he made everyone look intelligent: his Bostonians come across as an exceptionally on-the-ball bunch, ferociously so in the case of Richard Dana, a Sons of Liberty lawyer who investigated the Boston Massacre.
And he gave them style. Whatever Mrs. Jerathmael Bowers, wife of a wealthy Quaker, might actually have worn for her portrait sittings we'll never know, because Copley imposed a total wardrobe makeover, as he did for other clients who were, in his view, a step behind the international fashion curve. In the painting he gave her a madly un-Quakerish gown copied, right down to the rose in the decolletage, from a mezzotint print of an aristocratic portrait by Joshua Reynolds. To judge by her confident smile, Mrs. Bowers was thrilled.
But revolution was nigh and allegiances had to be pledged. Copley left town for London, where he stayed. Other American artists -- Charles Willson Peale, Gilbert Stuart and John Trumbull -- also spent time abroad, but came back. And all three shared, along with a trans-Atlantic adventure, a subject: George Washington.
Washington gets a lot of play at the Met. In Trumbull's full-length 1780 portrait he's a tallish, blandish military type with a slave by his side. (He owned several.) Peale gives us some sense of what made Washington attractive to people: standing at ease, hand on hip, he's kind of a dish and looks like a nice, serious guy, presidential material for sure. Then Stuart painted him when he was president, and what a change. In the familiar bust-length dollar-bill likeness, Washington is a tight-lipped, sidelong glancing eminence grise.
The monster Washington image, though, is a few galleries on. You glimpse Emanuel Leutze's ''Washington Crossing the Delaware'' from afar, and approach it down a navelike passage, as you would an altar in a church. How this 1851 painting gained its status as a Met masterpiece is an interesting tale, told in the museum's fall 2011 bulletin.
Suffice it to say that for decades after the painting's arrival, in 1897, the Met regarded it, at 21 feet long and 12 feet high, as more burden than blessing; basically, as a schlocky white elephant. But as often happens, not-great art turned out to be great box office. The public loved the Leutze: its hugeness, its heroic romanticism, its hyper-realism. Eventually the picture became famous for being famous, and no institution is going to argue with that. Set in a copy of its original ponderous gilded frame, the painting now has an impressive room around which the rest of the galleries turn.
It is in those galleries that the 19th-century story unfolds through a succession of objects tellingly deployed by a team of Met curators led by Morrison H. Heckscher, chairman of the American Wing. The rhythm isn't linear; it's forward and backward, yin and yang, a dance of contradictions, and this was true in America from the start. Many of Copley's elite subjects were committed Anglophiles; some who considered themselves freedom fighters in a people's revolution were fighting for the freedom to stay rich and get richer.
Class has always been one of the major divides in American culture. And many other rifts evident in the 19th century -- between city and country, white and black, have and have-not -- were related to it, a fact sometimes acknowledged only by art.
In the 1830s Thomas Cole, living in upstate New York, was formulating airy visions of America as a New World Arcadia. At the same time, out on Long Island, William Sidney Mount was embedding topical commentary on race and Jacksonian economics in seemingly laid-back genre pictures. And a bit earlier an urban artist, name now unknown, painted a crime-plagued slum neighborhood in Lower Manhattan called Five Points, home primarily to Irish immigrants and blacks, as a hell of depravity.
Inevitably it was Cole's utopianism that took the hardest reality hit. His ''View on the Catskill Early Autumn,'' the most beautiful of his several paintings at the Met, is a panorama of densely forested land near his upstate home. Just before he began the painting in 1836, most of that forest was leveled to make way for a railroad. Cole went ahead with the painting, but showed the landscape as it had been, not as the ruin it had become. The result is a conservationist cry of anguish as deep as it is discreet.
Autumn as a season, and as a state of mind, settled over the work of Cole's Hudson River School followers -- Frederic Edwin Church, Asher Brown Durand, Jasper Cropsey -- with the onset of the Civil War, though the war remained a shadow presence in landscapes. It was in figurative art, then coming back into favor, that the references were direct, and the Met has a potent display of such paintings.
They make a drab impression at first. They're smallish and unassertive and read clearly only up close. Half are by artists you've never heard of. But collectively they have the mute weight of epic tragedy: Theodor Kaufmann's scene of black women and children fleeing a battle; Otto Boetticher's aerial survey of Union soldiers lined up, like matchsticks, for a drill; Winslow Homer's painting of a lone man, back to us, holding a scythe and harvesting an ocean field of wheat the color of autumn leaves. Titled ''The Veteran in a New Field,'' it was done in 1865, just after the war had ended and Abraham Lincoln had been assassinated.
Postwar genre art comes next, with cozy, well-cushioned domestic scenes of middle-class family life. Paintings of men at work, including artists, offer evidence of a nation economically and psychologically on the mend, as do trompe l'oeil still lifes by William Michael Harnett and John F. Peto that take the accumulation of everyday things -- letters, photographs, ticket stubs, money, fiddles, guns -- as their subject.
It's tempting, while on this relatively upbeat path, to skip a gallery labeled ''The West, 1860-1910,'' crowded with Frederic Remington cowboys and images of American Indians as either a hostile force or a dying race. But for once you don't have an option: the only way out is through. And that's good, as this bellicose interlude tends to put the remaining episodes of the national art saga into perspective.
After it, soft-focus American Impressionism looks like the neo-Arcadian fluff that much of it is. And both the cosmic vehemence of Homer's Maine waves and the neurotic gravity of Thomas Eakins's Philadelphia friends make sense as emanations -- exalted ones -- of a culture perpetually grappling with interior wars, over impulses pitting progress against preservation, the material against the spiritual, and I against we.
Conflict continues to the end. From Homer and Eakins we walk into a party in progress of John Singer Sargent's Belle Epoque portraits, presided over by the luminous Madame Pierre Gautreau, a k a Madame X, a hothouse being who, with her lavender skin and scant attire, cannot and will not meet our gaze.
And there's one last gallery, dedicated to the artists of the early-20th-century Ashcan School, who were themselves dedicated, or so they claimed, to giving America's have-nothings a voice through art. George Luks's 1905 painting, ''The Old Duchess,'' holds court here, with its image of an imperious New York street-type. A gallery label tells us she wore five or six dresses at once and packed enough cash to buy drinks and get friends out of jail.
So, America the beautiful? The terrible? The everything-in-between? The art in the American Wing is, like the pageant of an election year, likely to complicate whatever convictions and doubts you bring to it. But this is what art should do; that's the point. It lets you keep your convictions and doubts open-ended. It campaigns for questions, not votes.
The New American Wing Galleries for Paintings, Sculpture and Decorative Arts are on permanent view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org.

HEADLINE: Governor Who Took On Unions May Face a Closely Watched Recall Election

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
MILWAUKEE -- Thousands of volunteers have raced to collect signatures near busy intersections and malls all over Wisconsin, at makeshift ''drive-through'' operations in parking lots, during Green Bay Packers viewing parties and New Year's Eve pub crawls, and even at a fold-up table inside Milwaukee's airport just off Concourse C.
By a state deadline on Tuesday, these volunteers, many of them Democrats and union supporters, say they will submit at least 720,000 names on petitions to recall Gov. Scott Walker, the Republican who curtailed collective bargaining rights for public workers, leading to a face-off in this state.
Only two governors in the nation's history have lost their jobs in recalls, but Mr. Walker himself acknowledges that, presuming there are no major flaws in the petitions, a recall election appears likely. That puts his removal, which would have a vote in late spring or early summer, within the realm of possibility. 
Politicians and political operatives far beyond Wisconsin will be watching closely, not just for what the recall effort may imply for other state's leaders who are considering cuts to workers' benefits and union powers as a way to solve budget problems, but also as a sign for the presidential race. Wisconsin was one of several pivotal Midwestern states that gave Barack Obama solid victories in 2008 but then elected Republicans, including Mr. Walker, in significant numbers in 2010. Money from outside the state is certain to pour in from both sides for the recall vote.
In an interview in which Mr. Walker reflected on what he described as his ''very surreal'' first year in office, he spoke of the outside forces. ''I think there's a real sense that the government unions don't want anybody -- Republican or Democrat -- doing this,'' Mr. Walker said of his moves to limit benefits and bargaining rights for public workers. ''And they're going to try to make an example of me.''
Although recall organizers, calling themselves United Wisconsin, say they expect to submit thousands more signatures than the 540,208 required for a new election (or one-quarter of the voters for governor in 2010), Mr. Walker said he believed he could ultimately hold onto his job. ''I look at it optimistically and say that means there's still a majority of voters in the state who opted not to sign a recall petition and hopefully a majority of whom want us to still keep moving the state forward.''
Around Wisconsin, where control of the governor's office and both chambers of the Legislature flipped to Republican from Democratic a year ago, people complain that the tone of political discourse has turned uncharacteristically feverish, polarized and ugly -- with the recall effort, which formally began in November, as only the latest evidence.
Scores of problems have been claimed: intentionally scribbled-on petitions, physical altercations about petitions, fake names on petitions, and a slew of screamed bad words (not to mention at least one egg) exchanged over petitions. Some Democrats say they began carrying cameras in case they needed to document untoward acts. And Republicans launched a ''Recall Integrity Center'' Web site where people could report ''shady tactics'' from the other side.
''One of the worst things that's happened in this state is how divided it's become over this, even inside some families,'' said Marlene Ott, who was gathering recall signatures last week inside the airport. Several people holding boarding passes spotted her portable stand and stopped to sign. But another passer-by, clutching the hands of two young girls, called out angrily, ''This is disgraceful, absolutely disgraceful!''
''Why,'' the man, Henri Kinson of Whitewater, asked afterward, ''should my granddaughters pay for these entitlements they're calling rights?''
The move against the governor is only part of the turmoil here. Separate recall drives are under way against the Republican lieutenant governor, Rebecca Kleefisch, and four Republican state senators, including Scott Fitzgerald, the majority leader, who helped pass Mr. Walker's collective bargaining plan after Senate Democrats left Wisconsin to prevent a vote. Last summer, the same issue led to nine recall elections, which resulted in two Senate seats changing hands and a narrower Republican majority of 17 to 16.
Carol Carlin, a retired teacher whose signs beckoned people to park in the driveway of her Milwaukee County house and add their names to recall petitions, said the psyches of public workers had been devastated by Mr. Walker's cuts. ''People don't want to become teachers when you are absolutely treated as the leeches on the system,'' she said.
Mr. Walker has said his cuts to collective bargaining were needed to solve a $3.6 billion state budget deficit and defends the move as one element of a plan to turn the state's economic climate around. But his critics' complaints now reach beyond the union issue, to questions about his handling of the environment, about a criminal investigation focused on people who worked for Milwaukee County during his tenure as county executive, and about his promises of 250,000 new jobs in the state during his four-year term.
In recent consecutive months, the state has been losing jobs, government estimates show, and since Mr. Walker took office, fewer than 20,000 new private sector jobs have been reported.
Recall movements around the country have increased in recent years, but they are by no means simple. Officials with the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, which oversees elections here, have estimated that a recall will cost at least $9 million, starting this week with a review of petitions that will require 50 temporary workers, extra office space, extremely tight security and at least 60 days of study for omissions and duplicated names. Legal challenges are also possible before a new election is assured.
Among the biggest hurdles facing Democrats: they have not settled on a candidate. Under Wisconsin's rules, Mr. Walker would appear on a recall ballot against an opponent. There would not merely be, as in some of the other 18 states with recall laws, an up-or-down vote on retention and then another election later.
Several names, including those of Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee, who lost to Mr. Walker in 2010, and Kathleen Falk, a former Dane County executive, have been mentioned, but a Democratic primary appears possible. At least some of the most widely known Democrats, including Russell D. Feingold, a former senator, have said they are not running.
In 2008, Mr. Obama won here by almost 14 percentage points, and a Republican presidential candidate has not won Wisconsin since 1984. But overwhelming Republican victories in 2010 and a State Supreme Court election in 2011 in which a justice seen as aligned with the Republicans held onto his job by a nearly even split of the state has raised new questions for races in the fall, including a United States Senate seat left open by the retirement of Herb Kohl, a Democrat.
''It's an early skirmish, a dry run, a fight of proxies and laboratory for experimentation,'' Mordecai Lee, a former state legislator who teaches at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said of the recall's significance for the presidential election.
On both sides, the recall could create a testing ground for larger national themes about collective bargaining and unions, and build volunteer and political operations (not to mention a list of some 720,000 recall signers) long before fall.
Facing the possibility of joining the ranks of Gray Davis, a California governor recalled in 2003, and Lynn Frazier, a North Dakota governor recalled in 1921, Mr. Walker said he wished he had approached the collective bargaining issue differently -- not in terms of his position, but in the way he laid the groundwork about the need for change to voters. ''I never realized,'' he said, ''how much national money and attention would come in on this particular issue.''

HEADLINE: Day Care Centers Adapt to Round-the-Clock Demand

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
ELYRIA, Ohio -- Dinner (chicken and mashed potatoes) was long over, teeth were brushed, and a rousing game of Monopoly had come to a close. It was 9 p.m., and the children nestled into bed under blankets emblazoned with superheroes.
The tranquil domestic scene plays out nightly here, not in a family home, but behind a brightly lighted storefront next to Tuffy's auto repair, the site of a new child care center that is open 24 hours a day.
Day care is slowly becoming night care in today's economy, as parents work ever longer days, take on second jobs and accept odd shifts to make ends meet.
''No one works Monday through Friday, 9 to 6 anymore,'' said Tiffany Bickley, a cook whose 6-year-old daughter, Airalyn, recently started going to the center, ABC & Me Childcare. ''No one.'' 
About 40 percent of the American labor force now works some form of nonstandard hours, including evenings, nights, weekends and early mornings, according to Harriet B. Presser, a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland. That share is expected to grow with the projected expansion of jobs in industries like nursing, retail and food service, which tend to require after-hours work.
At the same time, working hours are less predictable than they once were. ''There's a greater variability and irregularity of schedules,'' said Lonnie Golden, a professor of economics and labor studies at Pennsylvania State University. ''In surveys, more and more people are no longer able to specify a beginning or end of the workday.''
Yet for years it has been a frustrating reality for parents that child care services have failed to keep pace with the changing workday, with many centers still keeping a rigid 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. schedule. Experiments with nighttime care have come and gone over the years, but lingering ambivalence about the concept led most centers to deem it financially untenable.
''You don't want to put your 2-year-old at a child care center at 2 a.m.'' said Gina Adams, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. ''It just doesn't feel right.''
There are some indications now that this might be changing. The National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies said it was hearing from members that providers were offering more nontraditional hours, though it added that it did not formally track the data.
While overnight care is still relatively rare, evening hours are no longer so unusual, providers say. Donna McClintock, chief operating officer for Children's Choice Learning Centers Inc., which runs 46 employer-sponsored child care centers across the country, said that demand for nontraditional hours had grown and that centers providing care after-hours care made up a large part of the company's recent growth. About a fifth of the company's centers have added nontraditional hours in the past few years, she said.
Demand for nonstandard child care hours tends to be highest in sectors where employees tend to work varying schedules, like universities, hospitals and casinos.
''It's the wave of the future,'' said Roger Neugebauer, publisher of Exchange Magazine, a trade journal for the early childhood care field. ''The trend is to move beyond 9 to 5 because, with the changing economy, that's where the need is.''
In Ohio, the number of centers offering nighttime hours is up by more than 50 percent since 2003, according to the Ohio Child Care Resource and Referral Association. Centers with overnight hours have doubled and those open on weekends have quadrupled, though the absolute numbers remain small. In all, about 7 percent of Ohio's licensed child care centers offer some form of after-hours care, said Todd Barnhouse, executive director of the association.
Brianna Smith, who runs ABC & Me, said demand for such care had been strong in Elyria, a Rust Belt town that is part of Cleveland's sprawling suburbs. And though the recession hit hard here -- the median household income dropped by about 10 percent from 2006 to 2009, and unemployment rose to 11 percent in 2009 -- the center decided to include all-night hours when it opened in a converted carpet and tile showroom in June.
''There's a big need out there right now,'' Ms. Smith said. ''When I talk to parents, the first thing they ask is, 'What are your hours?' ''
Now the center is busy, literally, around the clock.
On a recent day, a grandmother dropped off a first grader at 4:30 a.m. on the way to her early morning shift at Burger King. A mother picked up her 3-year-old at 11:30 p.m. after getting off work at a nursing home. Another mother came for her 2-year-old twins at 1:30 a.m., after her shift as a cleaner at a gym.
For some children, the center's staff members act almost as surrogate parents -- feeding them dinner, helping them with homework, brushing their teeth and putting them to sleep until their parents come to fetch them.
Many of the parents interviewed for this article said that they would prefer that their children be watched in their own homes, but that baby-sitting was too expensive. The child care center offered the best compromise.
''It's really hard on nights when I don't get out until late,'' said Ms. Bickley, the cook. ''It's like, 'Sorry, here's your hug, now I got to get you to bed.' ''
But, she added, ''at least I know everything's taken care of.''
In some states, though, the economic downturn has caused a drop in evening hours among child care centers; with fewer parents employed, there is less need for licensed care. Child Care Aware of Kansas, an agency that connects parents with providers, said requests for evening care had reached 17 percent of all calls by 2008, but had fallen by about half since then.
Still, the new realities of modern life are propelling demand for after-hours care. Many women are in college while they work, lengthening the time away from their children. Morgan Miller, a nurse's aide who takes classes toward a nursing degree three mornings a week, says those hours, which are added to a workday in a nursing home that ends at 11 p.m., feel long to her 3-year-old son, Izaiah.
''Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, he is living in day care for the most part,'' she said. ''It's hard, but I'm doing what I have to do to make his life better.''
The sharp increase in single-parent households has also driven the demand. Alicia Fuerstenberg, a single mother who is a waitress at a Bob Evans, said she was glad to find ABC & Me to care for her 6-year-old twins, Michael and Mateo, during her evening shifts. Their father, who lives separately, does not pay child support, Ms. Fuerstenberg said, though he sometimes baby-sits. The recession decimated her mother's candle business, obliging her to take a job in a Harley-Davidson store and making her less available to help with child care.
''In my mind, I'm thinking, 'Day care is 6 to 6, and that's not going to work,' '' said Ms. Fuerstenberg, recalling her hunt for child care. ''But these hours are wonderful.''
She added, ''I probably wouldn't be working without it.''

HEADLINE: The Capital's Kitchen

 BODY:
For 23 years, D.C. Central Kitchen, the country's oldest community kitchen providing meals for the poor and homeless, has taken discarded food and marginalized people and found value in both. It's a nonprofit that gives new meaning to free enterprise. 
What started with one refrigerator truck has grown into an organization that provides about 5,000 meals a day to homeless shelters, halfway houses and other sites in Washington. Half the staff members are ex-convicts, former addicts or onetime homeless people, who finished the group's training program and are now prized employees.
In 2008, as the economy slid into a downturn, the kitchen employed 60 people and its annual budget was $7.4 million. Today, with the economy still struggling, the staff is twice as big and its budget has grown by almost 50 percent to over $10 million.
The growth has come by training people others consider unemployable and creating jobs in its income-producing Fresh Start catering business, for which it pays a decent wage with full benefits. With hunger rising in the recession, the kitchen has expanded to meet greater needs, but its leaders know that the solution to hunger ultimately is putting more people to work. The kitchen sees itself as helping to carry on Martin Luther King Jr.'s Poor People's Campaign for economic justice, empowering the dispossessed and feeding the hungry, caring for the people in line while helping to shorten it. The kitchen provides sustenance, income, dignity and hope.

HEADLINE: Black Student-Athletes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''N.C.A.A.'s 'Justice' System,'' by Joe Nocera (column, Jan. 7): 
Though Mr. Nocera has been given the impression by some readers that he is ''wasting valuable space writing about sports,'' such a discussion is vitally important. Given the economic context and the larger unemployment rate of black Americans, hovering around 16 percent (nearly double the national average, 8.5 percent), articles like Mr. Nocera's illustrate the educational detours or roadblocks that black American college student-athletes face in their pursuit of a college degree.
Are all college athletes pursuing a degree by default with the singular goal of becoming a professional athlete? No. Indeed, collegiate athletics are and have been a critically important avenue for disadvantaged minorities to acquire a college degree, an important tool of mobility (especially in these times).
That National Collegiate Athletic Association officials and college programs often hamper American minorities in acquiring a college education is not only disheartening but also deserves the spotlight provided by Mr. Nocera.

HEADLINE: How Fares The Dream?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
''I have a dream,'' declared Martin Luther King, in a speech that has lost none of its power to inspire. And some of that dream has come true. When King spoke in the summer of 1963, America was a nation that denied basic rights to millions of its citizens, simply because their skin was the wrong color. Today racism is no longer embedded in law. And while it has by no means been banished from the hearts of men, its grip is far weaker than once it was.
To say the obvious: to look at a photo of President Obama with his cabinet is to see a degree of racial openness -- and openness to women, too -- that would have seemed almost inconceivable in 1963. When we observe Martin Luther King's Birthday, we have something very real to celebrate: the civil rights movement was one of America's finest hours, and it made us a nation truer to its own ideals. 
Yet if King could see America now, I believe that he would be disappointed, and feel that his work was nowhere near done. He dreamed of a nation in which his children ''will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.'' But what we actually became is a nation that judges people not by the color of their skin -- or at least not as much as in the past -- but by the size of their paychecks. And in America, more than in most other wealthy nations, the size of your paycheck is strongly correlated with the size of your father's paycheck.
Goodbye Jim Crow, hello class system.
Economic inequality isn't inherently a racial issue, and rising inequality would be disturbing even if there weren't a racial dimension. But American society being what it is, there are racial implications to the way our incomes have been pulling apart. And in any case, King -- who was campaigning for higher wages when he was assassinated -- would surely have considered soaring inequality an evil to be opposed.
So, about that racial dimension: In the 1960s it was widely assumed that ending overt discrimination would improve the economic as well as legal status of minority groups. And at first this seemed to be happening. Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s substantial numbers of black families moved into the middle class, and even into the upper middle class; the percentage of black households in the top 20 percent of the income distribution nearly doubled.
But around 1980 the relative economic position of blacks in America stopped improving. Why? An important part of the answer, surely, is that circa 1980 income disparities in the United States began to widen dramatically, turning us into a society more unequal than at any time since the 1920s.
Think of the income distribution as a ladder, with different people on different rungs. Starting around 1980, the rungs began moving ever farther apart, adversely affecting black economic progress in two ways. First, because many blacks were still on the lower rungs, they were left behind as income at the top of the ladder soared while income near the bottom stagnated. Second, as the rungs moved farther apart, the ladder became harder to climb.
The Times recently reported on a well-established finding that still surprises many Americans when they hear about it: although we still see ourselves as the land of opportunity, we actually have less intergenerational economic mobility than other advanced nations. That is, the chances that someone born into a low-income family will end up with high income, or vice versa, are significantly lower here than in Canada or Europe.
And there's every reason to believe that our low economic mobility has a lot to do with our high level of income inequality.
Last week Alan Krueger, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, gave an important speech about income inequality, presenting a relationship he dubbed the ''Great Gatsby Curve.'' Highly unequal countries, he showed, have low mobility: the more unequal a society is, the greater the extent to which an individual's economic status is determined by his or her parents' status. And as Mr. Krueger pointed out, this relationship suggests that America in the year 2035 will have even less mobility than it has now, that it will be a place in which the economic prospects of children largely reflect the class into which they were born.
That is not a development we should meekly accept.
Mitt Romney says that we should discuss income inequality, if at all, only in ''quiet rooms.'' There was a time when people said the same thing about racial inequality. Luckily, however, there were people like Martin Luther King who refused to stay quiet. And we should follow their example today. For the fact is that rising inequality threatens to make America a different and worse place -- and we need to reverse that trend to preserve both our values and our dreams.

HEADLINE: In Silicon Valley, The Ripe Scent Of New Money

BYLINE: By EVELYN M. RUSLI and BEN PROTESS; Evelyn M. Rusli reported from Palo Alto, Calif., and Ben Protess from New York.

 BODY:
PALO ALTO, Calif. - Sam Odio expected a few congratulatory e-mails when he sold Divvyshot, his online photo-sharing service, to Facebook last April for millions of dollars.
Instead, his in-box was flooded with pitches from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other Wall Street firms looking to manage his newfound wealth. Goldman has the inside track, having courted him with an exclusive factory tour of Tesla, the electric sports-car maker, and tickets to a screening of the final Harry Potter film.
''They sure know the way to a geek's heart,'' said Mr. Odio, 27.
Wall Street, as always, is going where the money is - and right now that is Silicon Valley. The latest Internet boom means there are more newly minted millionaires, and even billionaires, than at any time since the technology bubble a decade ago. 
Many are brilliant young entrepreneurs and computer engineers. But for all their knowledge, the technology executives, many of whom are fresh out of college, are relatively clueless when it comes to estate planning.
''Betting the ranch on building a widget for the Facebook platform is very different than managing a long-term nest egg,'' said Jay Backstrand, a vice president at JPMorgan Chase's private bank.
Wall Street is more than happy to help - for a fee. Banks charge roughly 1 percent for overseeing a wealthy investor's portfolio. Though that may not sound like a lot, it adds up when billions of dollars are involved.
Financial firms are salivating over the wealth being created. Facebook is readying an initial public offering that will most likely value it near $100 billion. Employees and directors at Zynga own more than a third of the online game company, which went public in December at $7 billion. The list of prospects is long: Groupon is worth $12.2 billion; LinkedIn, $6.8 billion; and Pandora, $1.9 billion.
Banks are casting a wide net for potential clients. At Facebook, Wall Street brokers are wooing executives, rank-and-file employees and administrative staff members. Morgan Stanley has a dual strategy, with one team of advisers responsible for senior executives at large technology start-ups and another for lower-level employees. Chris Dupuy, who leads Merrill Lynch's wealth management team in the Pacific Northwest, recruits from the C-Suite to the ''corporate cafeteria.''
''Someone's going to capture this wealth,'' said Derek Fowler, a wealth adviser at Morgan Stanley. ''We just want to make sure we're out there.''
Banks are aggressively expanding in Northern California, even as they retrench globally. JPMorgan opened a 10,000-square-foot office in Palo Alto, Calif., a hub of venture capital activity. Goldman, which is eliminating some 1,000 jobs worldwide, plans to increase staff in San Francisco by 30 percent over the next year. UBS has more than doubled its wealth management staff in the area since 2008. ''It's very competitive,'' said Joseph A. Camarda, who relocated from Philadelphia to lead Goldman's wealth management group in San Francisco. ''I think every firm has an A-list team out here.''
This feeding frenzy is familiar to those who experienced the last Internet boom. In the late 1990s, Wall Street descended on Silicon Valley, luring clients from marquee names like Yahoo and eBay. But after scouting clients from start-ups that flopped when the bubble burst in 2000, some banks pulled back.
This time, banks seem more aggressive. With start-ups growing faster than ever before because of developments in computing technology, it is critical to build relationships early. The emergence of secondary exchanges has allowed employees to sell shares before companies go public. Google, Facebook and other Internet giants are snapping up start-ups to spur growth, turning founders into overnight millionaires.
Geoff Lewis, the co-founder and chief executive of TopGuest, a mobile application acquired by ezRez Software in December, said he was surprised by the banks' persistence. He was contacted by Goldman, UBS and Merrill within hours of the deal's announcement.
''One bank, when I didn't respond, asked if I'd like to attend a Sharks game with one of their managing directors to get to know them better,'' Mr. Lewis said. He passed.
Advisers often tap existing clients for prospects and also scour industry sites, like TechCrunch or AllThingsD. The professional social network LinkedIn is an indispensable tool, with its database of start-up employees.
Personal connections matter, too. Andy Ellwood, an executive at Gowalla. a mobile application, received several e-mails when the service was sold to Facebook in December. But Goldman had already been in touch for months, after a broker met Mr. Ellwood's girlfriend at a book club.
''In the middle of a lot of things going on, I didn't want to deal with an overly aggressive sales person,'' he said. ''It was nice to know that there's a friendly adviser, just a phone call away.''
But Silicon Valley's culture of flip-flops and T-shirts represents a challenge to Wall Street's staid, button-down brokers. Mutual funds and other investments don't typically appeal to entrepreneurs, who often use spare funds to finance other start-ups.
Travis Kalanick, a co-founder of Uber, an on-demand car service, hired a broker a few years ago. But he grew skeptical after the adviser suggested a complicated investment that would make money only if a stock index fell within a narrow range.
''I felt like I was walking into a casino, where the dealer knew more than I did,'' said Mr. Kalanick, who eventually left the brokerage firm.
Banks have been slow to adopt the latest technological innovations, which could make for a tougher sell in Silicon Valley. Neither Morgan Stanley nor Goldman has an iPad application for clients to manage their portfolio. Last year, a Merrill adviser met with a start-up employee in her 20s who brought along her parents. They discussed going to grad school or buying a home.
But Wall Street is trying to adapt its strategy.
Merrill executives are seeking advice from company employees under 30 on how to shape pitches. Barclays is pairing older wealth managers with young associates, who tend to be more familiar with social media.
''There are insights that one generation has - about technology, social media, networking - that another one may not fully appreciate,'' said Mitch Cox, head of the Americas for Barclays' private wealth management arm.
With a younger clientele, informational sessions focus on the basics, including buying a first home, paying off debt or building a portfolio.
Merrill offers ''boot camps,'' that explain fundamentals like mutual funds and dividends. The firm is building such a program for Facebook employees timed to the I.P.O., according to people briefed on the plans.
''It's a big business opportunity,'' said Greg Vaughan, a managing director at Morgan Stanley's Menlo Park office. ''There's a lot of wealth being created out here.''
Evelyn M. Rusli reported from Palo Alto, Calif., and Ben Protess from New York.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: On the Trail of Mortgage Fraud

 BODY:
Queens has been harder hit by foreclosures than any other New York borough, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation believes it has found a culprit. Last July, the F.B.I. accused Edul Ahmad, a local broker, of a $50 million mortgage fraud, saying he lured fellow immigrants into subprime mortgages, inflated the values of their properties and concealed his involvement in deals that were ruinous for scores, if not hundreds, of borrowers. Mr. Ahmad pleaded not guilty, and posted $2.5 million bail. Now, according to court papers, as reported in The Times, he is plea-bargaining with federal prosecutors. 
Whatever Mr. Ahmad did or did not do, one thing is sure: he did not act alone. The attention Mr. Ahmad has drawn highlights the relative lack of scrutiny of the big banks and their senior executives. Big banks created demand and provided credit for dubious mortgage loans, which they bundled into securities and sold to investors. If not for reckless lending and heedless securitizing, there would have been no mortgage bubble and no mortgage bust -- and, in all probability, no Edul Ahmad.
There have been some prominent civil suits with settlements and fines, including the $550 million deal between Goldman Sachs and the Securities and Exchange Commission over the misleading of investors in a mortgage-backed investment. Bank of America, which bought Countrywide Financial in 2008, recently agreed to pay $335 million to settle a lawsuit by the Justice Department over Countrywide's practice of steering black and Hispanic borrowers to subprime loans while similarly qualified white borrowers got better terms. But such cases have been narrowly focused and rarely name top executives.
What is needed is leadership by President Obama on this issue. He should form an interagency task force to investigate and pursue potential civil and criminal wrongdoing by institutions and people whose conduct in the mortgage chain had the greatest economic impact.
That would mean focusing on the large banks and their top echelons. The investigators would need to include the departments of Justice and Housing and Urban Development, the S.E.C. and the Internal Revenue Service, as well as bank regulators, with the formal co-operation of the most aggressive state attorneys general. The task force would need a leader with the impulses of a crusading prosecutor.
The investigations to date have not had this character. The Goldman Sachs settlement, for instance, was over one security and put the blame on a midlevel banker. When executives have been personally penalized, the fines have been a fraction of the wealth they amassed during the bubble. From 2000 to 2008, Angelo Mozilo, the chief executive of Countrywide, received total compensation estimated at $521.5 million; in 2010, without admitting or denying any wrongdoing, he paid $67.5 million to settle civil fraud charges brought by the S.E.C. The Justice Department, for its part, decided not to pursue a possible criminal case against Mr. Mozilo.
Lawsuits by state attorneys general, notably in Massachusetts and Nevada, may ultimately prove more revealing and helpful to wronged homeowners, because they tend to focus on foreclosure abuses by banks. New York's attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is building a comprehensive investigation of the mortgage chain from the origination and securitization of loans to banks' foreclosure practices. That may lead to more actors in the system being held accountable for creating the mortgage crisis. Mr. Ahmad is accused of swindling naive borrowers in Queens. There is more to the mortgage mess than that.

HEADLINE: An Unexpected Focus Before the Next Primary

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
The Republican battle for South Carolina was supposed to have been a time for the state's socially conservative voters to weed out the candidates they found unfit. Instead, the primary has been dominated by a loud and unruly argument over whether Bain Capital, the private equity firm that was led by Mitt Romney, drove companies out of business and put people out of work while enriching itself with billions of dollars.
That has pushed aside issues like abortion, gun rights and same-sex marriage, and, so far, has muddied the effort for conservatives to coalesce around a single candidate with credentials they might find acceptable. 
Attacks on Mr. Romney by Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry have prompted a furious backlash among some in the Republican establishment - a reflection of pragmatic concern about the long-term impact on the party's likeliest nominee and of indignation that the criticisms were a betrayal of the Republican belief in unfettered free enterprise. On Sunday, both Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Perry refused to disavow their attacks.
The next five days could be crucial as the candidates gather again to debate, first on Monday and then on Thursday. The debates will serve either as nationally televised forums for more attacks on Mr. Romney's business background or as a new opportunity for a more direct appeal to conservatives on social issues.
Here is a rundown of how the candidates have fared in the debate over Bain Capital, and how the subject might play out for them in the days ahead:
NEWT GINGRICH The decision to attack Mr. Romney's work at Bain Capital has given Mr. Gingrich's campaign new life after he finished in fourth place in New Hampshire. It drew the news media spotlight back to his campaign, giving him an opportunity to make his case as the best alternative to Mr. Romney.
But the attacks also allowed many to question Mr. Gingrich's motives and tactics. By this weekend, he was on the defensive for inaccuracies in an anti-Romney film being used in commercials by a pro-Gingrich ''super PAC.''
He said any inaccuracies should be corrected but refused to condemn the ads. Will voters hold him accountable for the commercials? Or will they buy into his argument that Mr. Romney would be too easily defeated by President Obama in the fall?
MITT ROMNEY The Bain Capital attacks have succeeded in putting Mr. Romney on the defensive just when he had hoped to capitalize on his victory in New Hampshire. His campaign was forced to run a new ad in South Carolina defending his work at Bain and citing companies that Bain helped to succeed.
But the attacks could persuade conservatives to rally behind Mr. Romney. Chris Chocola, the head of the conservative Club for Growth, who is not usually a fan of Mr. Romney's positions, came to his defense on Sunday, comparing Mr. Gingrich's argument to that of the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore.
RICK PERRY There is little evidence that Mr. Perry's decision to join in the Bain attacks have worked as effectively for him. His attacks were more quotable - he called Mr. Romney a ''vulture'' capitalist - but he has not had any significant money to broadcast ads making his argument.
RICK SANTORUM By refusing to engage in the criticism of Mr. Romney's time at Bain Capital, Mr. Santorum may hope to earn the support of voters who say, ''A pox on both their houses.''
It might work, but the Bain argument has complicated Mr. Santorum's efforts in South Carolina by muting the debate about social issues. The vote to support Mr. Santorum by a group of influential evangelical leaders in Texas on Saturday might help tilt the conversation back to those issues. But look for Mr. Santorum to bring them up even more in the debates.
RON PAUL The Bain conversation has made Mr. Paul all but invisible in South Carolina after having had some success in New Hampshire. He has continued running his typical campaign - talking about monetary policy, liberty and the need to draw back from foreign entanglements.
Mr. Paul is likely to receive support from his core supporters in South Carolina - students and libertarians.
But the state, with its large military community, is likely to be a less friendly place for his arguments about foreign policy than were New Hampshire and Iowa.

HEADLINE: Op-Ed Columnist: The Fraud Of the Tea Party

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

 BODY:
I see by the calendar that Congress is due back in session Tuesday, whatever that means. They've actually been in session - sorta, kinda, why not? - a parliamentary trick to prevent President Obama from naming people to keep the government running. But even that is in dispute.
Thus far, the Worst Congress Ever has done nothing but show that the United States can be a nonfunctioning democracy when it wants to, like Italy but with all-you-can-eat buffets. In a single demi-term, it nearly shut down the government, fouled a fledgling economic recovery with a pointless fight over the debt ceiling, and then threatened to withhold spending money for 160 million working Americans by raising the payroll tax. Brinkmanship is its only game. 
Oh, but the House did pass a measure barring the government from encouraging use of energy-efficient light bulbs. ''With a President Bachmann, Americans can buy any light bulb they want.'' So said Representative Michele Bachmann, until recently a candidate for president and a self-proclaimed leader of the Tea Party. You see how far she got.
It would be easy, using Bachmann and her Republican Party majority in the House as prime exhibits, to see the Tea Party as a collection of buffoons and know-nothings who have now run out of helium. But the movement, largely leaderless, was born out of legitimate frustration over Wall Street bailouts and runaway government spending. People in funny costumes made a lot of noise, and claimed responsibility for handing Republicans control of the House in the 2010 elections.
Now that they've had time to govern - an oxymoron in the Tea Party case - and have all but formally picked a presidential candidate, this crowd has shown its true colors. In theory, the Tea Party's calls for revolutionary pride and citizen power would jolt the sclerotic heart of Washington. In practice, the Tea Party has proved to be a fraud, betraying the professed ideals from which it sprang.
In the presidential race,Ron Paul, the daft, grandfatherly skinflint who wants to cut a trillion dollars in federal spending right off the top, should be leading the movement's parade. But polls in key primary states show that people who describe themselves as Tea Party members support Mitt Romney,Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum.
Each of the front-runners, in obvious ways, represents what the Tea Party hates. Romney, as is well known, is the founding father of Obamacare - the law requiring people to get health insurance, pioneered by him in Massachusetts. He supported the huge bailout of Wall Street, which passed all that downside capitalistic risk on to the rest of us. Hooray for the socialist from Bain Capital!
After 30 years at the fetid waters of power, Gingrich, of course, is the ultimate Washington insider, and he took $1.6 million from government-sponsored Freddie Mac, which Tea Partiers blame for the housing collapse.
And Santorum, during his 16 years in Congress, never met an earmark he could not support, from a bilingual health care studies program at a college in his home state to the infamous Bridge to Nowhere. Critics of big spending say he has requested more than $1 billion in earmarks during his time at the trough.
O.K., so people have to lower their sights. After all, getting rid of Obama is the ultimate goal for Tea Partiers, so they will settle for someone who isn't the best-looking guy at the dance, to use a Santorum line.
What about the actual members elected to Congress by the Tea Party movement? Among the showier freshmen, Representative Joe Walsh of Illinois has had trouble paying his child support and his back taxes, while hissing about fiscal irresponsibility. And Representative Allen West of Florida is known for comparing Democrats to Nazis.
In truth, the Tea Party gang never intended to govern, or - God forbid - compromise. They were birthed by Fox News and right-wing radio, where fact-challenged outrage is the blood that keeps the heart pumping.
The public, certainly, has soured on them, even in the reddest of states. A Pew poll in November of 60 districts represented by members of the House Tea Party caucus found that just 25 percent of constituents agreed with the goals of the group.
And because Republicans hitched their wagon to the Tea Party, they share the crash. More Americans identified themselves as independents, 40 percent in 2011, than in any year since Gallup began measuring party affiliation. Republicans were at 27 percent, and Democrats at 31 in that poll earlier this month.
As we approach one of the more clamorous elections in our history, some people are mystified that the Tea Party has disappeared. They shouldn't be. It was a media creation, and such things, whether Kardashian or political, never last.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Huntsman Set To End His Bid; Backs Romney

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY; Michael D. Shear contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
CHARLESTON, S.C. - Jon M. Huntsman Jr. will announce Monday that he is ending his bid for the Republican presidential nomination and endorsing Mitt Romney, narrowing the field and erasing a challenge to Mr. Romney from the moderate wing of his party.
Mr. Huntsman, who had hoped to use the South Carolina primary this week to revive his flagging candidacy, informed his advisers on Sunday that he was bowing to political reality and would back Mr. Romney, whom he accused a week ago of putting party ahead of country. 
Mr. Huntsman, who had struggled to live up to the early expectations of his candidacy, was to deliver a speech Monday morning in Myrtle Beach, where the five remaining major Republican candidates will gather hours later for a debate. His endorsement of Mr. Romney is indication of the party establishment getting behind Mr. Romney and trying to focus the party on defeating President Obama.
''The governor and his family, at this point in the race, decided it was time for Republicans to rally around a candidate who could beat Barack Obama and turn around the economy,'' Matt David, Mr. Huntsman's campaign manager, said in an interview Sunday evening. ''That candidate is Gov. Mitt Romney.''
But Mr. Huntsman's decision was unlikely to have any particular influence where Mr. Romney needs it most, among social and religious conservatives who remain wary of Mr. Romney's ideological inconsistency. With the withdrawal of Mr. Huntsman, who despite his efforts to portray himself as more conservative than Mr. Romney was often viewed as the moderate in the race, the South Carolina primary is now Mr. Romney against an array of opponents coming at him from the right.
Mr. Romney faces challenges from Rick Santorum, the former senator from Pennsylvania, and Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker. Also on the ballot in South Carolina are Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who has shown few signs of attracting a following here, and Ron Paul, the libertarian-leaning congressman from Texas.
Both Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich are hoping for strong enough showings here to go on as the main alternatives to Mr. Romney. After months in which social conservatives have been fractured, Mr. Santorum is trying to energize his candidacy in the wake of a vote by evangelical leaders over the weekend to back him.
It was a disappointing finale to the high-flying presidential aspirations of Mr. Huntsman.
A third-place finish in the New Hampshire primary last week failed to jump-start his candidacy, aides said, and his campaign limped into South Carolina with little money. Mr. Huntsman had spent days pondering his future in the race, and aides said he told them on Sunday that he was unlikely to topple Mr. Romney or match the momentum of his Republican rivals in the conservative Southern primary.
Mr. Huntsman and Mr. Romney had been competing for similarly moderate voters, and aides said he had come to the realization that he had little chance to win and that the votes he would receive would come from Mr. Romney's potential voter pool.
To the extent that Mr. Huntsman had the support of those moderate Republican voters, his departure from race removes any competition for that segment of the party's electorate, giving Mr. Romney breathing room to focus even more on persuading evangelical voters who have been cooler to his candidacy that he is the more electable candidate in November.
Yet late Sunday evening, a spokesman for Mr. Gingrich sought to portray the decision by Mr. Huntsman as a boon to him, saying in a statement, ''We are one step closer to a bold Reagan conservative winning the G.O.P. nomination.''
The decision from Mr. Huntsman came on the same day that he received the endorsement from The State, the newspaper in the capital, Columbia. He had campaigned in South Carolina over the weekend, not giving any indication that the end was near.
While Mr. Romney and Mr. Huntsman were both here in Charleston, aides said the two men had not spoken Sunday evening. When approached at a downtown restaurant here, a table of senior advisers to Mr. Romney declined to discuss the endorsement.
''No comment,'' said Eric Fernstrom, an aide. ''''But the bread pudding is outstanding.'' On Monday morning, Mr. Romney and Mr. Huntsman were scheduled to speak.
Mr. Huntsman first signaled his presidential ambitions here in South Carolina in May, days after returning from Beijing, where he had been the United States ambassador to China. He surrounded himself with a roster of veteran advisers who positioned Mr. Huntsman as a new brand of Republican.
He formally announced his candidacy in June, in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty, calling for a more civil kind of presidential campaign and promising a better future than the one that Mr. Obama would provide.
''He and I have a difference of opinion on how to help a country we both love,'' Mr. Huntsman said of Mr. Obama. ''But the question each of us wants the voters to answer is who will be the better president, not who's the better American.''
But the campaign of ''civility, humanity and respect'' that Mr. Huntsman promised quickly faded into the background as his Republican rivals seized the attention - and the support - of a party faithful that seemed more interested in red-meat politics.
Voters also seemed wary of a candidacy by a person whose most recent service was to the very man he now wanted to oust. Fawning letters that Mr. Huntsman wrote about Mr. Obama's leadership did not help that case.
For months, Mr. Huntsman languished near the bottom in the national polls and eventually gave up on competing in Iowa. He moved his campaign headquarters to Florida, betting that he could wait until that primary to make his move.
But as the first contests got closer, Mr. Huntsman made the decision to move his campaign to New Hampshire, where he hoped that the presence of independent voters would help his chances. Mr. Huntsman did better in New Hampshire than polls might have suggested, but he came in a distant third behind Mr. Romney and Mr. Paul.
But Mr. Obama's top advisers seemed to see the danger in Mr. Huntsman's candidacy, signaling in 2009 that they thought he might be a strong contender.

HEADLINE: Romney Advantage: Unequally Matched Rivals

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As effective as Mitt Romney's campaign has been, it has benefited from one unusual advantage: the absence so far of a fully competitive rival for the Republican nomination.
Mr. Romney still faces many challenges, not the least of which is the hostility of many evangelical leaders, who sought to rally support on Saturday for former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. But through the early stages of the nominating contest, no recent Republican standard-bearer has had such a diffuse and shifting field of opponents.
Four years ago, Senator John McCain of Arizona had to survive a challenge from Mr. Romney. In 2000, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas had to grapple with Mr. McCain. 
In 1996, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas confronted Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. Eight years earlier, Vice President George Bush faced Mr. Dole and Representative Jack Kemp of New York. In 1980, former Gov. Ronald Reagan of California had to defeat the elder Mr. Bush.
Yet, all of Mr. Romney's remaining opponents are, to greater or lesser degrees, politically disabled. Not one has the combination of meticulous planning, governing, campaign experience and money that has propelled him into a commanding position heading into South Carolina.
While Mr. Santorum questions whether Mr. Romney is a ''full spectrum conservative,'' Mr. Romney can credibly claim to be the only full-spectrum candidate in the field.
Mr. Santorum, six years removed from losing his Senate seat, has run a shoestring campaign that until recently focused almost entirely on Iowa. Former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. of Utah, who is expected to formally announce his withdrawal from the race on Monday, bypassed Iowa and camped out in New Hampshire. Newt Gingrich, 13 years after being driven from the House speakership, survived 2011 with strong debate performances but with little money and a skeletal staff.
Like Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, whose verbal missteps stripped credibility from his candidacy late last year, Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Santorum and Mr. Huntsman failed to amass enough petition signatures to make the Virginia primary ballot. At 76, Representative Ron Paul of Texas has run a niche candidacy aimed at fellow Republican libertarians.
Why has no stronger opponent emerged? Campaign professionals cite at least four factors.
Political heavyweights who declined to enter the 2012 race all had uniquely personal reasons. Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana faced family resistance; former Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi feared being bogged down in the politics of race; Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey doubted his readiness for the Oval Office.
But all of them would have had to cope with the withering scrutiny of a 21st-century news media that imposes growing burdens on would-be presidents.
''Who wants to go through this meat grinder?'' asked Ken Khachigian, a veteran strategist of Republican presidential campaigns. Mr. Romney's status as someone who ''never smoked, never drank, never did drugs, stayed married to one woman,'' he added, short-circuited some of that scrutiny.
A second factor was the economic difficulty that choked off the number and generosity of campaign donors. Mr. Romney had a huge head start with his personal wealth and broad network of donors -- including former financial industry colleagues and fellow Mormons -- that he has tended since his 2008 campaign.
''The fund-raising environment was enormously difficult,'' said Phil Musser, a strategist for the short-lived campaign of former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota. Mr. Musser said potential donors ''just sat on their hands'' throughout 2010 as Mr. Pawlenty, initially seen as Mr. Romney's most formidable rival, struggled to build a financial apparatus to compete.
A third factor has been the lackluster performance of two other candidates who once seemed destined to present major challenges to Mr. Romney.
Mr. Huntsman, who served as ambassador to China in the Obama administration, had trouble convincing his party that he was a true conservative, and sometimes seemed to be challenging its message. Mr. Perry briefly stood atop the polls and challenged Mr. Romney's fund-raising dominance before his ''oops'' brain freeze in a debate in November undercut his credibility.
''The one guy with excellent potential turned out to be a gaffe monster,'' said Daron Shaw, a political scientist at the University of Texas who was a campaign adviser to the younger Mr. Bush.
A final obstacle has been the unruly nature of Tea Party-era Republicans. Just as Speaker John A. Boehner has struggled to control the House Republican caucus, would-be White House contenders face the daunting challenge of winning over the most fervent advocates of budget-cutting and immigration crackdowns without compromising their appeal to mainstream voters in a general election.
It is little wonder then that the Republican campaign at different points has elevated candidates, like Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and the business executive Herman Cain, who could speak to conservative activists but could not overcome the challenge of building an electoral majority.
The heavy schedule of televised debates, which replaced much of the on-the-ground campaigning of earlier races, sometimes made it difficult to tell if Mr. Cain, for example, was actually seeking the White House or instead raising his profile and selling books.
''It's the rise of the blogosphere, the rise of reality TV, the self-publishing, self-broadcasting world,'' said Kim Alfano, a media consultant to Mr. Daniels and other Republicans. ''Everyone has a voice.''
Ms. Alfano said the cacophony of voices, extreme positions and unorthodox campaigns that emerged after the 2010 Tea Party movement could hobble Mr. Romney's ability to compete with Mr. Obama if he prevails for the nomination.
''We are talking about the things that matter,'' Ms. Alfano said, referring to issues like fiscal discipline, economic growth and tax reform. ''We are all in on the Republican language.
''But we have not handled things well in talking about them. We're about to jump the shark.''
In Mr. Romney's successes in Iowa and New Hampshire, however, Ms. Alfano sees at least some reassurance for traditional campaign strategists. ''What we're finding is that the basics still apply,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Flexing Muscle, Baghdad Detains U.S. Contractors

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT and ERIC SCHMITT; Michael S. Schmidt reported from Baghdad, and Eric Schmitt from Washington.

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- Iraqi authorities have detained a few hundred foreign contractors in recent weeks, industry officials say, including many Americans who work for the United States Embassy, in one of the first major signs of the Iraqi government's asserting its sovereignty after the American troop withdrawal last month.
The detentions have occurred largely at the airport in Baghdad and at checkpoints around the capital after the Iraqi authorities raised questions about the contractors' documents, including visas, weapons permits and authorizations to drive certain routes. Although no formal charges have been filed, the detentions have lasted from a few hours to nearly three weeks.
The crackdown comes amid other moves by the Iraqi government to take over functions that had been performed by the United States military and to claim areas of the country it had controlled. In the final weeks of the military withdrawal, the son of Iraq's prime minister began evicting Western companies and contractors from the heavily fortified Green Zone, which had been the heart of the United States military operation for much of the war. 
Just after the last American troops left in December, the Iraqis stopped issuing and renewing many weapons licenses and other authorizations. The restrictions created a sequence of events in which contractors were being detained for having expired documents that the government would not renew.
The Iraqi authorities have also imposed new limitations on visas. In some recent cases, contractors have been told they have 10 days to leave Iraq or face arrest in what some industry officials call a form of controlled harassment.
Latif Rashid, a senior adviser to the Iraqi president, Jalal Talabani, and a former minister of water, said in an interview that the Iraqis' deep mistrust of security contractors had led the government to strictly monitor them. ''We have to apply our own rules now,'' he said.
This month, Iraqi authorities kept scores of contractors penned up at Baghdad's international airport for nearly a week until their visa disputes were resolved. Industry officials said more than 100 foreigners were detained; American officials acknowledged the detainments but would not put a number on them.
Private contractors are integral to postwar Iraq's economic development and security, foreign businessmen and American officials say, but they remain a powerful symbol of American might, with some Iraqis accusing them of running roughshod over the country.
An image of contractors as trigger-happy mercenaries who were above the law was seared into the minds of Iraqis after several violent episodes involving private sector workers, chief among them the 2007 shooting in Baghdad's Nisour Square when military contractors for Blackwater killed 17 civilians.
Iraq's oil sector alone, which accounts for more than 90 percent of the government's budget, relies heavily on tens of thousands of foreign employees. The United States Embassy employs 5,000 contractors to protect its 11,000 employees and to train the Iraqi military to operate tanks, helicopters and weapons systems that the United States has sold them.
The United States had been providing much of the accreditation for contractors to work in Iraq. But after the military withdrawal, contractors had to deal with a Iraqi bureaucracy at a time when the government was engulfed in a political crisis and Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, fearing a coup, was moving tanks into the Green Zone.
The delays for visa approvals have disrupted the daily movement of supplies and personnel around Iraq, prompting formal protests from dozens of companies operating in Iraq. And they have raised deeper questions about how the Maliki government intends to treat foreign workers and how willing foreign companies will be to invest here.
''While private organizations are often able to resolve low-level disputes and irregularities, this issue is beyond our ability to resolve,'' the International Stability Operations Association, a Washington-based group that represents more than 50 companies and aid organizations that work in conflict, post-conflict and disaster relief zones, said in a letter on Sunday to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Doug Brooks, president of the organization, said in a telephone interview that the number of civilian contractors who have been detained was in the ''low hundreds.'' He added in an e-mail on Sunday, ''Everyone is impacted, but the roots have more to do with political infighting than any hostility to the U.S.''
As Iraqi and American officials were negotiating last summer to keep American troops in Iraq into 2012, the Iraqis refused to grant American troops immunity from Iraqi law, in large part because of violent episodes like the one in Nisour Square. Although the contractors working for the embassy are doing many of the same jobs American troops had, including training, logistics, maintenance and private security, they are not protected from Iraqi law.
Mr. Rashid, the adviser to Mr. Talabani, said Iraqis are fed up with foreign contractors. ''The Iraqi public is not happy with security contractors. They caused a lot of pain,'' he said. ''There is a general bad feeling towards the security contractors among the Iraqis and that has created bad feelings towards them all.''
Mr. Rashid said that traveling to the United States to work was no different. ''Every time I go to the airport in New York they open my suitcase three times,'' he said. ''How long does it take to get an American visa?''
An adviser to Mr. Maliki said that as part of the current agreement between the United States and Iraq, no Americans should be in the country without the permission of the Iraqi government.
''Iraq always welcomes foreigners into the country, but they have to come through legally and in a way that respects that Iraq now has sovereignty and control over its land,'' said the adviser, Ali Moussawi.
Last month, two Americans, a Fijian and 12 Iraqis employed by Triple Canopy, a private security company, were detained for 18 days after their 10-vehicle convoy from Kalsu, south of Baghdad, to Taji, north of the capital, was stopped for what Iraqi officials said was improper paperwork.
One of the Americans, Alex Antiohos, 32, a former Army Green Beret medic from North Babylon, N.Y., who served in the Iraq war, said in a telephone interview Sunday that he and his colleagues were kept at an Iraqi army camp, fed insect-infested plates of rice and fish, forced to sleep in a former jail, and though not physically mistreated were verbally threatened by an Iraqi general who visited them periodically. ''At times, I feared for my safety,'' Mr. Antiohos said.
In a statement, Triple Canopy, which denied any problems with documents, said that during the detention period, company officials were in contact with employees by cellphone, and brought them food, blankets, clothing, medical supplies and cellphone batteries. All were released unharmed on Dec. 27.
The detention drew the ire of Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican who heads the House Homeland Security Committee. His office was contacted by Mr. Antiohos's wife on Dec. 19 seeking help to get the employees released. Mr. King criticized the United States Embassy in Baghdad for failing to help release the contractors caught in a drama that he said might have resulted in part from rival Iraqi ministries' battling for political primacy.
''They could have been held as power plays by one Iraq department against another, but what adds to the problem is that it does not appear that the State Department is doing anything near what they could be doing,'' Mr. King said in a telephone interview.
The United States Embassy in Baghdad, as well as senior State Department and military officials, say that no Americans are currently being detained, and they insist the detentions and visa delays are more the result of bureaucratic inexperience than malevolent intentions.
''The embassy has pushed for consistency and transparency in the government of Iraq's immigration and customs procedures and urged American citizens to review their travel documents to ensure that they comply with Iraqi requirements to help avoid such incidents,'' an Embassy spokesman said in a statement.
One senior American military official said that the current disconnect between the Iraqis and the contractors was ''primarily an adjustment of our standard operating procedures as we adapt our people and they adapt their security forces to the new situation.''

HEADLINE: France's Gloomy Economic Outlook Haunts Nation's Presidential Race

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Elvire Camus, Scott Sayare and Sophie Cohen contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Hakim Benselama, 32, an industrial engineer, nearly had a job in autumn 2008, but as the world economic crisis hit, he said, ''I got phone call after phone call telling me that the projects I had interviewed for were all canceled.'' He has been jobless since.
Radmila Zakovic, 59, went for benefits at the local unemployment office for herself and her two sons, both jobless. She had told them that if they finished school, they would find careers. ''I feel like I've lied to my children,'' she said.
As President Nicolas Sarkozy contemplates his race for re-election, with the first round of voting 100 days away, he is confronted with an economy reeling from the euro crisis and nearly zero growth. France has just lost its AAA credit rating and must cut government spending. The unemployment rate is 9.9 percent, a 12-year high, and rising. 
The loss of the treasured AAA rating, while expected, was a blow to France's status in Europe, making it seem less like a power than a problem. The downgrade makes it harder for France to pretend to be Germany's equal in leading the European Union, which the French-German partnership has traditionally dominated. That, in turn, will make it harder for France, Italy and Spain to challenge the German recipe of austerity and to press harder for more liberal, pro-growth policies from the European Central Bank.
The downgrade was also a major political blow to Mr. Sarkozy and his prospects in the coming election. Polls show the main concerns of voters are clear: the size of the French debt, the cost of living, unemployment and general economic insecurity. Mr. Sarkozy's rivals, fairly or not, leave little doubt where to place the blame.
''It is Sarkozy's politics that have been downgraded, not France,'' said Francois Hollande, the Socialist candidate who leads in the polls. Mr. Sarkozy's presidency, with higher debt and higher unemployment, has been a disaster, Mr. Hollande said, but he has provided few details about his own plans.
It is hard to see how France can quickly extricate itself from its economic morass. It is Europe's most centralized, state-dominated economy, and it is deeply invested in its opposition to what the French call the Anglo-Saxon economies of Britain and the United States, whose laissez-faire approach they blame for the 2008 financial crisis.
Yet, like Europe's lagging Mediterranean countries, though to a lesser extent, France is having trouble competing with the larger German economy, which is more flexible, less confrontational in its relations with employees and more solidly built on industry and exports.
While Mr. Sarkozy blames the 2008 global financial shock for France's woes, the real problem, said Nicolas Baverez, an economist and historian, ''is the unsustainable economic and social model of the last three decades.'' France, like other European countries, benefited from cheap credit, leading to a society in which nearly two-thirds of the economic growth depended on consumption, partly financed by social transfers. Those, in turn, were financed by public debt that has ballooned to 86 percent of the gross domestic product in 2011 from 20 percent in 1980.
The main criticism of Mr. Sarkozy is that while he promised ''a rupture'' with the past to modernize France's heavily state-dominated economy -- liberalizing the tax system, eliminating the 35-hour workweek, reducing bureaucracy and improving purchasing power -- he has accomplished little in the face of political and union opposition, save for an important delay in the retirement age. The Socialists, if they win, are unlikely to be much braver, altering the edges of tax and social policy, but not the core.
For Mr. Sarkozy and other European leaders, the euro crisis and the heavy sovereign debts that led to it have created a kind of political prison. Normally, faced with high unemployment and stagnant growth, leaders would spend to stimulate the economy, investing in infrastructure, education and job training. Instead, pressed by the markets and his own promises to limit deficits, Mr. Sarkozy has had to cut government spending and raise taxes in an election year.
But France's efforts to repair its figures -- as with the rest of the countries in the euro zone -- are ''too little, too late,'' said Francois Heisbourg of the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris.
Politically, Mr. Sarkozy is forced to present himself as the responsible, decisive manager of crisis compared with Mr. Hollande, who has mockingly described the Sarkozy appeal to voters this way: ''I'm a president who has failed for five years; I'm a nasty guy, but re-elect me because in these hard times, I am the only one who can do it.''
Recently, Mr. Sarkozy has proposed in rapid fire a series of proposals -- including a ''social VAT,'' an increase in the value-added tax on consumption to lower the burden of social benefits on companies, to encourage hiring. He wants to allow companies more flexibility to negotiate working hours and pay, and to enshrine a balanced-budget requirement in the Constitution.
But coming so late, his array of ideas can seem panicky, reminding voters of other Sarkozy reforms that never happened.
More important, economists say, they do not address France's main economic problems, which are both historical and structural. Government spending currently represents about 56.6 percent of the French economy, compared with about 46 percent in Germany and Italy.
''France is the sick man of Europe,'' Mr. Baverez said, adding that the main problem is the government's domination of the economy, ''the highest rate in the developed world.'' There are about 5.5 million state employees in France, 18 percent more than in 2002, and about 500,000 more than in Germany, a federal state with 82 million inhabitants, 26 percent larger than France.
While Mr. Hollande has said the Socialists will respect austerity, he is considered unlikely to do much to shrink the state.
France is also falling behind in global competition and production. French exports have been dropping steadily, primarily because the country has few competitive medium-size enterprises, a great strength of Germany.
There are about 185 French companies with more than 5,000 employees, and these do extremely well, Mr. Baverez said. But the overall number of industrial enterprises has dropped since 2000, he said, with a loss of 500,000 jobs. In a country of 65 million people, there are only 4,200 companies with 250 to 5,000 employees.
While French productivity is good, the French work fewer hours than most other Europeans. Part of the problem is the 35-hour workweek, passed by the Socialists, which Mr. Sarkozy has not dismantled. According to a recent study, the French work on average six fewer weeks a year than the Germans, fewer hours than the Greeks and 236 fewer hours a year than they did in 1998.
France's other main problem is connected to its flagging industrial sector. It has persistently high unemployment, particularly among its youth, 24 percent, and immigrants, 43 percent. The last time the unemployment rate was 7 percent was in 1977.
On one of Paris's most fashionable streets, a few steps from Mr. Sarkozy's Elysee Palace, A. Fragonard has long sold high-quality women's clothing. But it is closing -- another casualty of tougher times. The shopkeeper, an older man elegantly dressed in an ascot, presided over a going-out-of-business sale. He handed a customer a pen, which did not work.
''Ah, Madam,'' he said, tears welling in his eyes, ''you see, even the pen is finished.''

HEADLINE: Homemaker Dad, Breadwinner Mom

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: The current tax code subsidizes affluent households where only one spouse works but not those of lower-income couples, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
"He cooks, cleans - and lets his wife climb the corporate ladder." This perfect husband stars in a recent cover story in Bloomberg Businessweek, echoing one published in Fortune almost 10 years ago: Many women who are chief executives depend on a husband willing to take on a job that wives have traditionally performed: chief domestic officer. Unless someone else manages the home, it's hard to compete successfully with other managers at the office.
Role reversal generally helps reveal the importance of other people's roles. As both stories clearly document, gender norms are loosening up, though in 2010, husbands were the sole earner in about 20 percent of all marriages, wives in about 9 percent, according to a recent report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Homemaker fathers seem to enjoy a little more cultural respect than they did 10 years ago, even if women remain the "default" parent. The Bloomberg Businessweek cover pictured a handsome, casually dressed young man (standing inside a giant pink baby bottle), while the Fortune cover pictured an older man dressed in a distinctly dowdy apron. Most homemaker dads would prefer the former image, and most express more commitment to child care than to housework.
But role reversal doesn't seem like a terribly inviting prospect, even for those who prefer it to traditional gender roles. What's bad for the goose is bad for the gander.

Adults who completely devote themselves to family care, whether they are male or female, reduce their employability and future earnings. This may not matter much for individuals at the top of the income distribution, who can live off their investments or maintain skills that allow them to work as consultants.
But it matters a great deal for those who need to find a job once their children are grown.
Specialization may increase efficiency in some tasks, but diversification also has advantages. Children might prefer a portfolio of caregivers, including both dad and mom, to one full-time specialist. And many adults would prefer to combine paid work with family work, the better to appreciate both their colleagues and their children.
As the Bloomberg Businessweek story makes clear, public policies in the Nordic countries, in particular, make it easier for parents to reconcile employment with family care. Janet Gornick and Marcia Meyers provide more details in their book "Families That Work," along with calculations of what it would cost for the United States to move in a similar direction.
Tax policy in the United States currently discourages shared parenting, by providing significant tax benefits to breadwinners with stay-at-home spouses, whether they provide care for children or other family members in need of assistance or not.
In a recent article in the Columbia Journal of Gender and Law, Martha T. McCluskey explains the excruciatingly complicated federal income tax code provisions that bear on this issue.
Because married breadwinner/homemaker couples are taxed on their joint income, marriage to a full-time homemaker with zero earnings often puts a full-time breadwinner in a lower tax bracket. Inequality in earnings - as when one spouse has none - generates a marriage tax bonus.
On the other hand, marriage to a person whose earnings resemble one's own typically offers no tax benefits. Equality in earnings eliminates the marriage tax bonus.
The bonus phases out at highest income levels but is substantial for many upper-middle class couples. The bonus is minimal for couples with income of $40,000 or less, who typically owe little in federal income taxes.
Having a stay-at-home spouse is a luxury that relatively few families can afford. Partly because they typically earn less than whites, African-American married couples are seldom able to indulge. African-Americans are also far less likely than whites to be married.
As Edward McCaffery points out in his book "Taxing Women," the Social Security system also subsidizes stay-at-home spouses, who are eligible for a spousal benefit whether they have contributed to the Social Security system as employees or not.
Professor McCluskey asserts that the marriage tax bonus should be termed "aid for affluent husband care." Given the existence of homemaker dads, a more accurate term is "aid for affluent spouse care."
Whatever we call it, there is no reason to subsidize it. Beautifully decorated living rooms and gourmet meals are delightful after a long day at the office - but they shouldn't come at taxpayers' expense.
Raising children and taking care of other family members who genuinely need assistance does offer important public benefits. That's why we should provide more generous public support for those activities and encourage families who share responsibilities for care.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Destroying the Internet

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Have you thought about renaming your products or services lately? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Big Story: S.B.A. Gains Clout?
The Small Business Administration is invited back to the grown-ups' table (but reaction among small-business advocates is mixed).
Trade Shows: C.E.S. Loses Clout?
This year's annual International Consumer Electronics Show had lots to offer for small business, and Startup America firms converged on the event. And there were plenty of models - and Justin Timberlake, too. But many feel that the show is losing its clout. Matt Ryan explains why you should be glad you didn't go: "Only a handful of companies are very good about keeping secrets, and they don't typically announce products at C.E.S." But you could have seen these 12 quirky gadgets on display. Or checked out some really strange laptops. The Neat Company introduced new scanners aimed at small businesses. Tom Simonite says there were three gems hidden in Steve Ballmer's final keynote speech. Apple had 250 ninjas spying. TechRepublic took a lot of photos. CNET declared the winners. My favorite: this awesome toilet seat. Meanwhile, the auto industry had its own little show.
The Data: The Fed Turns a Profit
The Federal Reserve, which continues to weigh another round of easing, returned $77 billion in profits to the United States Treasury and said our economy is expanding. But one member warns of a potential rise in interest rates. Consumer borrowing jumped. Retail sales were weak in December. Economic confidence rose to a seven-month high, small-business confidence surged and Lance Roberts shows how this affects unemployment. Structural unemployment may continue for a decade. But that is not why the doomsday clock was moved. TD Bank says small businesses are expecting stable or improving revenue performance in the early months of 2012. Lending to small business was up 18 percent in 2011 (or was it?). Mall occupancy firms up. Demand for manufacturing technology increased year over year but as the dollar grows stronger American manufacturing could suffer.
Marketing: Social Media Case Studies
Google announces a new personal approach to its search methodology, plans to go after local small businesses aggressively and photographs a woman falling on the street.Here's a quick start guide to social media. Mark Schaefer lists some excellent case studies of companies that used social media to help them develop their products. This young lady is an excellent case study of the power of viral video to get a date with Jason Segel. Derek Singleton explains how manufacturers can use social media to win more business. These 10 companies hit the bull's-eye with their online contests. If you're in Chicago Tuesday, check out this social media presentation on how to compete. Keep an eye on Pinterest, a fast-growing service that promises to increase Web traffic. John Sternal offers 41 ideas to get public relations exposure (but this guy got too much exposure in this French clothing ad). Laura Finlayson shares five social media rules we learned in kindergarten, including, "Use your indoor voice": "Social media is not advertising and marketers need to quash any urges to use their advertising voices here."
Red Tape: Destroying the Internet?
Inc. takes us deeper inside the fight against SOPA. The tech community responds by blacking out. White spaces are finally open for business and those crazy accountants are back with another cool video. Speaking of accounting, 1099-K forms are becoming more prominent in 2011 filings for small businesses. A new study says small-business owners prefer same-sex financial advisers. President Obama considers tax breaks to bring back manufacturing jobs. Hostess filesfor bankruptcy, and a blogger blames pension costs.
Around the World: Sex, Bombs and Burgers
High unemployment now places a number of rich European countries up there with the most miserable countries in the world. How bad is it? The mafia is now Italy's No. 1 bank, and the Philippines are starting to look like more and more fun. Peter Nowak says America is exceptional because of sex, bombs and burgers, and the global economy has taken a turn for the better.These 10 American brands are popular in China. Ann Lee imagines a world without China, and a Chinese businessman warns college students about starting a business there. But c'mon, this is a country that builds 30-story buildings in 15 days!
Around the Country: Grow or Slow?
A member of Adriana Gardella's business group talks about Goldman Sachs's 10,000 Small Businesses program. An educational Webinar, titled "The Playbook for Small Businesses," is scheduled for Wednesday. In New York, a factory grows in Brooklyn, small businesses and monster rats expand and the Philharmonic is silenced by a ringing phone. Start-ups in Puerto Rico want to put the islandon the start-up map. Brother and StartupNation start a grant program to help owners live the dream. You decide (because I can't figure it out): will business travel grow or slow in 2012? Hotel rates increase and are expected to continue increasing. Small businesses are becoming big campaign stops, but this New Hampshire restaurant bars the candidates. A Washington company is again offering search engine optimization training courses in 2012.
Management: Reducing Chatter
The Better Business Bureau says be careful when you hear "top 10" (that's also good advice when you're bungee jumping). An airline passenger has a few suggestions for the industry. In this video, Terry Starbucker says there are nine ways social media can make us better leaders. Joyce Rosenberg offers tips for reducing chatter in the office. Macro Man introduces 10 management terms for 2012, including : "Basically an idea or thought process that only the Deep Sea 10 global rescue vehicle from a 1960s puppet show could pull off." Sally Ann Hughes offers advice for acquiring a competing business.
Ideas: Females to Follow
Would-be author TJ McCue needs our help to finance his next business book project. Springwise offers 10 business ideas and opportunities for 2012. Natalie MacNeil lists female entrepreneurs to follow on Twitter. Guess what? Are you ready for this: a study finds that people want to date someone who is attractive. A report finds that consumers intend to buy fewer televisions this year. But the future for electric cars looks good. Charlie Sheen is sane again. Life expectancy reaches a new high. Finally, an easy way to read a broadsheet newspaper.
Start-Up: If They Existed
This company will help us get that fuzzy feeling from helping a small business grow in the neighborhood. Martin Sullivan says it's start-ups (pdf), not small businesses, that create jobs. Sarah Kessler suggests six start-ups to watch in 2012. Here are 13 start-ups that would be awesome (if they existed).
Boss of the Week: Mike O'Shaughnessy
Mike O'Shaughnessy's company, Element Electronics, will soon be manufacturing HDTVs in the United States. "We have watched for years as jobs have left America for other countries," he said. "We have wanted to and planned for producing TVs here, at home. Element Electronics wants to pioneer a resurgence of creating quality manufacturing jobs in the U.S.A." Here's a 3-year-old acting like a boss.
Technology: Is This Microsoft's Year?
While Windows-based PCs are expected to continue dominating the workplace through 2013, Apple products will "storm the corporate hardware market," according to Forrester Research. Apple's new chief executive rakes it in (actually he really didn't make as much as some people think). Even so, could 2012 be the year of, well, Microsoft? Mark Fidelman says companies should be more like I.B.M. and less like Apple. A small-business management suite gets an $8 million vote of confidence. One company is counting on a rush to the cloud. Sven Rasmussen explains why small businesses should upgrade networks: "offering wireless access in a conference room simply isn't enough for most small businesses." Ron Schenone exposes seven technology myths, including: "a 64-bit O.S. will make computing twice as fast as a 32-bit one."
This Week's Bests
Lesson from Tony Soprano. Donald DeSantis says "everything I need to know about start-ups, I learned from a crime boss," including, "cut out the middleman": "Sometimes the middleman's market is so huge, that a freaking enormous business can be built simply by providing their customers a lower cost and more efficient option. Two-sided marketplace businesses are a textbook example of this type of disruption."
Explanation of the myth of American productivity. Michael Mandel: "Our bullish measures of productivity suffer from an enormous statistical blind spot. Rather than wait for rising productivity to save the day - and relying on economic policies that are essentially complacent - the U.S. needs to adopt drastic measures if it wants to keep living standards from falling."
Ideas for naming your product. Tom Grasty: "In the name game, being allusive can be a powerful attribute. Take the word, Amazon, for example. For Jeff Bezos, books always were just the beginning. From the very outset, the forward-thinking entrepreneur saw his company expanding well beyond the written word. Don't kid yourself. The selection of the name Amazon was hardly happenstance. Bezos deliberately chose a word that alluded to the business he saw downstream, rather than the actual entrepreneurial waters he set out to navigate in 1995."
This Week's Question: Have you thought about renaming your products or services lately?

HEADLINE: Not So Global

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Of a consumer dollar, 85 cents still spent here. 

 BODY:
Barry Ritholtz sends us to a San Francisco Fed paper from last summer that makes a point on which many people seem confused: despite globalization and all that, the bulk of a consumer dollar spent in America falls on American-produced goods and services.
The reason this matters -- or at least one reason it matters -- is for discussion of austerity, stimulus, and all that. I often get comments along the lines of "Well, maybe stimulus worked back in the old days, but now it just means spending more on stuff from China". In reality, that's nowhere near true.
Why? For one thing, most consumer spending is on services, few of which are really tradable. For another, even if the thing you buy in WalMart says "Made in China", the price includes a lot of US value-added in the form of transportation and retailing costs. 
Here's the paper's estimates of the share of personal consumption expenditure (PCE) spent on imports in general and imports from China:
So we're still a country where about 85 cents of your consumer dollar is spent at home, one way or another. And this means, among other things, that the rules of macroeconomics haven't changed nearly as much as people imagine.

HEADLINE: Mistaken Identities (Wonkish)

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: And other common fallacies. 

 BODY:
Via Mark Thoma, Noah Smith* has a terrific piece on how to argue with economists. All the points are good, but I'd like to focus on Principle 4, "Argument by accounting identity almost never works."
What he's referring to, I assume, is arguments like "since savings equals investment, fiscal stimulus can't affect overall spending", or "since the current account balance is equal to the difference between domestic saving and domestic investment, exchange rates can't affect trade". The first argument is, more or less, Say's Law and/or the Treasury view. The second argument is what John Williamson called the doctrine of immaculate transfer. 
Why are such arguments so misleading? Noah doesn't fully explain, so let me put in a further word. As I see it, economic explanations pretty much always have to involve micromotives and macrobehavior (the title of a book by Tom Schelling). That is, when we tell economic stories, they normally involve describing how the actions of individuals, driven by individual motives (and maybe, though not necessarily, by rational self-interest), add up to interesting behavior at the aggregate level.
And the key point is that individuals in general neither know nor care about aggregate accounting identities. Take the doctrine of immaculate transfer: if you want to claim that a rise in savings translates directly into a fall in the trade deficit, without any depreciation of the currency, you have to tell me how that rise in savings induces domestic consumers to buy fewer foreign goods, or foreign consumers to buy more domestic goods. Don't tell me about how the identity must hold, tell me about the mechanism that induces the individual decisions that make it hold. 
And once you do that, you realize that something else has to be happening -- a slump in the economy, a depreciation of the real exchange rate, it depends on the circumstances, but it can't be immaculate, with nothing moving to enforce the identity.
When it comes to confusions about the macro implications of S=I, again the question is how the identity gets reflected in individual motives -- is it via the interest rate, via changes in GDP, or what?
Accounting identities are important; in fact, they're the law. But they should inform your stories about how people behave, not act as a substitute for behavioral analysis.
*On his home page, Noah says he is named Smith like everyone else. No, not among economists. Many years ago I ran a small NBER conference that happened to include two Itos from Japan and two Parks from Korea; the conference director (Kirsten Foss) and I had a discussion about whether, as a courtesy, all the Americans should adopt the same name, and if so what name. We agreed that the generic name for an American economist was "Stein."

HIGHLIGHT: An imaginary boom. 

 BODY:
Ah. Noah Smith goes reading in the fresh waters, and finds that people there are still claiming that there was a dramatic improvement in growth once Reagan/Friedman came along.
I've written about this many times, e.g. here. The great era of US economic growth was the postwar generation; even during the good years of the 90s we didn't achieve comparable growth, and overall, the post-Reagan era was marked by slower growth than the equivalent period of time pre-Reagan. And I haven't even gotten into the income distribution thing.
All of which makes me wonder: what goes on in these peoples' minds? Do they never even think of actually looking at the numbers, because they that Reagan ushered in a great boom? Inquiring minds (which they obviously don't have) want to know.

HEADLINE: Hulu Adds to Its Original Programming Lineup

BYLINE: BRIAN STELTER


HIGHLIGHT: Hulu said Sunday that it would add more original programming to its Web site with the introduction of its first scripted series, "Battleground," and a documentary series by the writer and director Richard Linklater. 

 BODY:
Lining up more original programming for its Web site, Hulu said Sunday that it would introduce its first scripted series, "Battleground," and a documentary series by the writer and director Richard Linklater.
The streaming video Web site, co-owned by the parent companies of the NBC, Fox and ABC networks and the private equity firm Providence Equity Partners, also said that in March, it would premiere the second season of "A Day in the Life," its first original show, which started last summer.
By adding more shows of its own, Hulu is simultaneously reducing its dependence on its network owners and acting as a competitor to them. It is also competing more directly with Netflix, the streaming video giant, which is commissioning original series of its own, and YouTube, which is promoting a wide swath of new online channels.

Hulu shares attributes of both Netflix and YouTube. Like Netflix, it has a subscription service, Hulu Plus, but like YouTube, much of its library is freely viewable and supported by advertisements. Initially, the three shows will not require a subscription.
The streaming video sites are fundamentally changing what it means to make and distribute a television show. The political mock-documentary "Battleground," which will start on Feb. 14, will look and feel like a TV sitcom -- think "The Office" -- with 22-minute-long episodes debuting every Tuesday. But the episodes will only be available on-demand on Hulu.
The Web site released a two-and-a-half-minute-long trailer on Sunday, when it promoted "Battleground" to television reporters at the twice-annual Television Critics Association press tour.
Mr. Linklater's series, "Up to Speed," does not yet have a premiere date. It will involve tours of what Hulu calls the "monumentally ignored monuments of America's cities," like the "luckiest subway grate in New York City."
Along with "A Day in the Life," Hulu also has a daily show called "The Morning After" that summarizes what happened on television the prior day.
Andy Forssell, the chief content officer for Hulu, indicated in an interview with Bloomberg that the company is planning to raise money this year as it continues to add original shows. A Hulu spokeswoman declined to comment.
Hulu said in a blog post last week that it posted about $420 million in revenue in 2011, up 60 percent over the prior year. A significant (but undisclosed) portion of this revenue came from Hulu Plus, which now has more than 1.5 million subscribers. "This number continues to grow extremely fast," the Hulu chief executive, Jason Kilar, said.
After explaining the economics of the business, he said, "We are excited to invest approximately half a billion in content in 2012 on behalf of our users."

11:21 P.M. | What Was Left Unsaid ... Can Be Used on Thursday
As Mr. Romney's rivals look back at Monday's debate, they are likely to note some things they didn't do.
They didn't really attack Mr. Romney on health care and whether his Massachusetts plan served as the inspiration for Mr. Obama's health care plan.
They also didn't attack him for his comment about knowing what it's like to get a pink slip, or about liking to fire people who provide services to him - a statement that was taken out of context on the campaign trail but was avoided Monday night.
But Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Santorum no doubt had one thing in the back of their minds: There's always Thursday, when the candidates will gather again for another debate.
- 
11:20 P.M. | Voters' Voices: A Victory for Gingrich 
Here's post-debate analysis from the King family and friends. They thought Newt Gingrich won. Four of them are now planning to vote for Mr. Gingrich, one is leaning that way, and one is still not sure.
Mike King, 49: "I feel pretty sure I'm going to vote for Gingrich. I feel better about Ron Paul than I used to feel. But he's still very weak on his views on other countries and how we should leave them alone. If a country on the other side of the world has a completely different view than my own, that wouldn't work."
Lisa King, 48, his wife: "I'm sticking with Newt. He's experienced. He's a thinker. He's thought things through. He's very smart." Will she vote for Mr. Romney, if he is the nominee? "Yeah, I'll vote for him. I'm fearful that he won't do as well against Obama."
Mary King, 17, their daughter: "This has solidified my opinion of Newt Gingrich. I feel less comfortable about Mitt Romney. I thought he didn't do well. In the past he may have been the 'winner' of the debate. But not this time." She would still vote for Mr. Romney if he won the nomination. "Yes, I would. Nobody's perfect. Man has fallen. You always have to pick the lesser of two evils."
Shawna Whitaker, 28: "I think I'm going with Gingrich. I do feel better about Ron Paul. I still like Gingrich more. I think Gingrich has the best shot of winning. He seemed to get the applause even over Romney."
Becky Griffith, 18: "I didn't really like Rick Santorum or Rick Perry. But I'd have to do more research. I still don't know."
Kaleigh Smith, 19: "I'm also leaning toward Newt Gingrich. Beside outward, grandfatherly appearances, I liked what he had to say about the unemployed and food stamps. I liked Romney for his presidential appearance. He seemed very comforting. He'd fit the picture very well. But I didn't like the way he dodged questions. He seemed passive-aggressive."
- 
11:08 P.M. | Romney the Hunter 
Mr. Romney was cool and collected tonight. But there was that one awkward moment.
The one about hunting. He just never seems ready for that question.
Asked whether he hunts, and if so, what, Mr. Romney initially recalled that he had hunted moose, then corrected himself to say it was elk and pheasant.
"I'm not going to describe all of my great exploits," he said awkwardly, suggesting perhaps that there have been great exploits.
But he quickly realized that "great exploits" may overstate the reality and he became deferential, praising the skills of others on the stage, like Mr. Perry.
"I'm not the great hunter," he admitted sheepishly.
Virtually the same question in 2007 created one of the most awkward - and mocked - answers of his first presidential bid. After saying during that campaign that he was a lifelong hunter, he was asked to explain.
"I'm not a big-game hunter. I've made that very clear," Mr. Romney said at the time. "I've always been a rodent and rabbit hunter. Small varmints, if you will. I began when I was 15 or so and I have hunted those kinds of varmints since then. More than two times."
Small varmints? Sounds like Mr. Romney's prey has gotten just a bit bigger since then.
Wonder if a few moose are worried tonight?
- 
11:04 P.M. | Romney Calls McCain-Feingold a 'Disaster'
Talk about awkward. 
In an exchange near the end of the debate on the role of "super PACs" in the campaign, Mr. Romney expressed his displeasure with current campaign finance laws and declared that the landmark campaign finance reform legislation known as McCain-Feingold "is a disaster."
That may not sit well with Mr. Romney's biggest-name endorser and campaign surrogate these days: Senator John McCain of Arizona, who co-wrote the 2002 law. 
But perhaps Mr. McCain has learned to live with it. Sally Canfield, Mr. Romney's policy director from his 2008 campaign, tweeted after the debate that "Romney opposition to McCain-Feingold is not new. Also supported repeal in 2008."
- 
11:00 P.M. | Fact Check: Gingrich and U.N. Program
Newt Gingrich said Mitt Romney's "super PAC" had distorted his record on a bill he co-sponsored with Representative Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, with Mr. Romney saying that the bill would have given $60 million a year to a United Nations program supporting China's brutal one-child policy.
The bill actually attempted to address climate change, PolitiFact says, and a third of the House members were co-sponsors. 
"The bill did propose money for the United Nations Population Fund, but it stated specifically that its funding could not be used for 'involuntary sterilization or abortion or to coerce any person to accept family planning,' " PolitiFact said.
- 
10:57 P.M. | Voters' Voices: Gun Rights an Important Issue 
The gun issue caught the King family's attention.
Mitt Romney said he would create no new restrictions on gun ownership. The family agreed with his answer, but found it inauthentic.
"A gun owner position would be, 'I have an AR-15 and I'll shoot any soldier coming down the street trying to take it from me,' " Michael King said. "That's what a real gun owner's answer would be."
Shawna Whitaker, a family friend, said gun laws don't work.
"Law-abiding citizens aren't the problem," she said. "Citizens who don't obey the law are going to get their hands on a gun anyway."
- 
10:56 P.M. | Gingrich and Romney Exchange Blows on 'Super PACs'
There eventually had to be a clash between Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich over the "super PACs" that back them.
Mr. Gingrich was the first to claim indignation, saying that he wanted Mr. Romney to "exercise leadership" in getting the pro-Romney group to stop the negative ads.
The fact that the pro-Romney super PAC has not stopped, Mr. Gingrich said, "makes you wonder how much influence he would have if he were president."
It was a good line, but Mr. Romney had one of his own.
"You have a super PAC ad that attacks me," Mr. Romney said. "It's probably the biggest hoax since Bigfoot."
Mr. Romney insisted that both men have said the same thing - fix the ads or take them off of the air.
"For you to suggest that you and I have different standards here is just not right," Mr. Romney said.
- 
10:56 P.M. | Fact Check: Obama and Food Stamps
Newt Gingrich described President Obama as "the best food stamp president in American history'' and said the growth of food aid tended to "maximize dependency.''
"More people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history,'' Mr. Gingrich said Monday.
Agriculture Department statistics show that the number of food stamp recipients has increased 44 percent, to 46.2 million in October 2011, from 32 million in January 2009, when Mr. Obama took office.
The total cost of the program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, increased to $75.3 billion in fiscal year 2011, from $53.6 billion in fiscal year 2009 and $33 billion in fiscal year 2007, before the recession began.
The growth partly reflects an increase in need, as millions of Americans have lost income and lost jobs or remain out of work. In addition, food prices have increased, eligibility has been expanded, and the 2009 economic stimulus law temporarily increased benefits.
Before Mr. Obama took office, food stamp participation was rising, in part because of federal policies that encouraged low-income people to seek aid for which they were eligible.
Nearly half of food stamp recipients are under age 18. Nearly 30 percent of food stamp households have earned income. Only 15 percent of such households have income above the poverty level ($18,500 for a family of three in 2011).
- 
10:53 P.M. | Fact Check: Gingrich on Balanced Budgets
While making the case for why his plan to privatize Social Security would not add to the national debt, Mr. Gingrich argued that he was responsible for four balanced federal budgets - and so could be trusted to be fiscally responsible. 
It is a claim Mr. Gingrich makes almost every day on the campaign trail, but it is based on an odd timeline. The years of balanced budgets in question are from fiscal 1998 through 2001, but Mr. Gingrich was in office for only the first two. He left the House in January 1999 and had no role in crafting the budgets for the subsequent two years. 
When pressed on this discrepancy, Mr. Gingrich sometimes argues that he deserves credit for policies enacted in the 1990s that promoted economic prosperity and established a climate for balancing budgets that carried beyond his time in office. 
This is at least the third time The Times has fact-checked this claim. PolitiFact has also looked into it repeatedly, most recently at the last Fox News debate in Iowa in December, when it was rated "false."
- 
10:51 P.M. | Fact Check: Obama and Military Spending
Mitt Romney was wrong in stating that Mr. Obama wants to cut $1 trillion from military spending. The administration is committed to reductions of less than half that amount over 10 years - about $450 billion, or roughly 8 percent of the Pentagon budget over a decade.
Moreover, Congressional Republicans as well as Democrats support the level of cuts that Mr. Obama seeks. The cuts were mandated as part of the bipartisan deficit-reduction agreement with Mr. Obama in August. That bipartisan deal does include another round of cuts in January 2013 that would be automatic, half in domestic programs and half in the military, and it would bring total military reductions to about $1 trillion over 10 years. But the administration opposes that outcome for the Pentagon. Mr. Obama's defense secretary, Leon Panetta, has said reductions on that scale would be ruinous. Mr. Obama has proposed alternative deficit-reduction measures to avoid the threatened automatic cuts, but Republicans oppose his plan because it calls for additional revenues from higher taxes on the wealthy as well as spending reductions in entitlement benefit programs like Medicare, farm subsidies and federal pension programs.
- 
10:43 P.M. | Romney Assesses His Biggest Threat
Whom does Mitt Romney fear more - Newt Gingrich or Rick Santorum? 
The last exchange may give a clue. 
When asked whether he wanted to jump into a debate over Social Security between the two men, Mr. Romney thought a moment and then said, "Rick is right."
He went on to agree with Mr. Santorum about the need for sacrifice and cuts to balance the budget. And then he agreed with a phrase that Mr. Santorum had just used to describe Mr. Gingrich's position: "fiscal insanity."
That kind of (temporary) alliance of sorts might suggest that Mr. Romney thinks he needs to worry about Mr. Gingrich.
- 
10:35 P.M. | Romney Chooses Words Carefully on Social Security
Clever wording alert: Mitt Romney said that to keep Social Security solvent, he would "add a year or two" to the retirement age for future recipients. 
His word choice stands out. Generally, presidential candidates speak, reluctantly, of "raising the retirement age" - a political bugaboo that has long upset American voters, who, perhaps unsurprisingly, do not want their retirement age to be a moving target. 
Mr. Romney seems to be testing out a new, gentler way of asking America's future retirees to work longer before collecting their full Social Security benefits.
- 
10:32 P.M. | Newt Gingrich, Historian
Mr. Gingrich is a historian again.
Asked about his plan to allow young people to invest their Social Security funds, he reached back to one of the many hats he has worn.
"As a historian, it's a fact-based model," Mr. Gingrich said. He talked a few minutes later about "the historic record in Chile" and said, "These are just historic facts."
Of course, the defense that Mr. Gingrich gave to having received more than $1 million working for Freddie Mac, the mortgage giant? 
He was a historian for that outfit.
- 
10:29 P.M. | Voters' Voices: Balancing Military Spending 
South Carolina has a strong military culture, but the King family is divided by Representative Ron Paul's statement that he would cut overseas military spending, but not eliminate defense jobs.
"We are wasting money on lots of things in military deployments," Mr. King said. But he wants to make sure that the United States has enough troops overseas to respond to any threats, especially from Iran.
Mary King, 17, said she would worry about cutting military spending if it meant eliminating jobs.
"So many people are employed by the U.S. military overseas," she said. "I don't think all of those should be taken away."
- 
10:28 P.M. | Audience Making Itself Heard
This has been one of the loudest audiences to attend the many debates that have been held during the Republican contest.
But the booing and applause may be deceiving in that they probably say little about how the state will vote on Saturday.
Still, it's good television, and could help cement the idea that one of the candidates has won the debate - at least in the eyes of those in the hall.
By that measure, the winner so far might be Newt Gingrich, who seems to have garnered the most applause from the audience.
- 
10:27 P.M. | Fact Check: Negotiating With the Taliban 
Mitt Romney says he would never negotiate an end to the war in Afghanistan with the Taliban. Instead, he argued, "we should kill the Taliban."
On this issue, he is at odds with not only the Obama administration, but also with many of his fellow Republicans. As Henry Kissinger, among others, have pointed out, you don't end wars negotiating with your friends. You end them negotiating with your enemies. It was a Republican president - Dwight D. Eisenhower - who negotiated a cease-fire in Korea in the early 1950s, and another Republican, Richard M. Nixon, who negotiated an exit from Vietnam. 
And it was the most recent Republican president, George W. Bush, whose administration took the position that the United States needed to defeat Al Qaeda but not the Taliban. The latter, argued Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, can be diminished, and forced to the bargaining table. But Mr. Romney would take a far harder-line position. What he did not say is how many troops it would take - and how many years it would take - to defeat the Taliban.
But in his critique that Mr. Obama weakened the American negotiating position by setting a date for American withdrawal, Mr. Romney is very much in the mainstream - many in the Pentagon agree with him. So do some Democratic strategists.
- 
10:24 P.M. | Voters' Voices: Impressed by Gingrich 
The King family thinks Newt Gingrich's comments about race were very effective. 
Mr. Gingrich has repeatedly called President Obama a "food stamp president." One of the debate moderators, Juan Williams, who is black, asked Mr. Gingrich whether his words were offensive to poor African-Americans.
"Juan is trying to milk the racial question," said Mike King, who is leaning toward supporting Mr. Gingrich. "He's trying to hype everyone up."
- 
10:23 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney on Tax Returns
Mr. Romney declined to commit to release his income tax returns when challenged twice, first by Mr. Gingrich and then by a debate questioner, but said he might do so in April. Last month, he said in an interview that he doubted that he would release the returns.
The nonpartisan fact-checking organization PolitiFact said in December that a Democratic National Committee claim that presidential candidates have traditionally released their income tax returns was "mostly true." The group reviewed the post-Watergate presidential races and found that of 34 presidential and vice-presidential candidates, seven declined to release their returns.
PolitiFact noted that Mr. Romney did not release his returns when he ran for governor and senator in Massachusetts and for president in 2008. It estimated his fortune at $190 million and $250 million, based on financial disclosure forms required of all presidential candidates by the Federal Election Commission.
- 
10:20 P.M. | Caucus Click: Uncle Sam in Attendance 
The question was familiar - virtually the same one that was famously asked of Democratic candidates for president in 2008: If there was actionable intelligence about Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, in Pakistan, would you go in?
Newt Gingrich took a while to get to the answer, but it was unmistakable.
"Andrew Jackson had a pretty clear idea about America's enemies," he said. "Kill them."
Mr. Romney had a pretty clear answer as well.
"We go anywhere they are, and we kill 'em," Mr. Romney said.
That, of course, was not Mr. Paul's answer. His answer prompted loud boos from the audience.
"Maybe we ought to consider a golden rule," Mr. Paul said. "Don't do to other nations what we don't want them to do to us."
- 
10:07 P.M. | Gingrich Shows His Debate Skills
Newt Gingrich is demonstrating again the kind of rhetorical flourishes that helped raise his campaign to the top during previous debates.
In an exchange with one moderator, Juan Williams, over how best to encourage employment among the poor, Mr. Gingrich skillfully got the audience on his side.
The audience booed Mr. Williams as Mr. Gingrich seized the mantle of the politically incorrect, declaring that he was merely trying to help poor people find jobs.
"They would be getting money," he declared. "Which is a good thing if you're poor. Only the elites despise making money."
That statement earned him a huge round of applause and showed how Mr. Gingrich might handle a similar exchange with Mr. Obama if he were to become the nominee.
The exchange also harked back to Mr. Gingrich's hands-off approach to his rivals before the negative campaigning of the last weeks before the Iowa caucuses. It was that approach - to avoid attacking rivals - that many people had said they admired in Mr. Gingrich.
- 
10:01 P.M. | Fact Check: Santorum on Education
Mr. Santorum's call earlier in the debate for the federal government to get out of elementary and secondary education was a crowd pleaser for an audience full of conservatives. He may have also had in mind Christian home schoolers in South Carolina. (Mr. Santorum and his wife home-schooled their children.) 
But the full ramifications of such a withdrawal are perhaps not fully appreciated. Historically, public education has been a responsibility of state and local governments, with the federal government imposing standards meant to raise the achievement of disadvantaged students and to ensure that students with disabilities receive an equal education. 
According to the Department of Education Web site, the federal government currently contributes 10.8 percent of the cost of elementary and secondary education. Much of the department's $68 billion budget supports classroom enrichment for poor students and aid for students with disabilities.
The federal money is both carrot and stick to compel school districts to enforce federal laws. All of the Republican candidates have called for a significant cutback in this formula, which has had bipartisan support since the 1960s. The candidates often say they would give the money as block grants to states and local districts, while repealing federal requirements. 
But many education experts, including in conservative research groups, doubt that many states would continue to uphold federal standards for poor and disabled students.
- 
10:00 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney on Obama's Job Plan
Mitt Romney said that while he already has a jobs plan even though he is not "yet" president, President Obama does not have a jobs plan. This is incorrect.
Mr. Obama sent legislation to Congress in early September that called for $447 billion in temporary tax cuts and spending initiatives that private-sector macroeconomic forecasters said would create up to 1.9 million additional jobs in 2012 and add up to two percentage points to the rate of economic growth. More than half of the package consists of tax cuts, including an extension and expansion of the current two-point cut in workers' 6.2 percent payroll tax for Social Security contributions, to reduce it to 3.1 percent while providing relief to employers as well. 
Mr. Obama also called for financing for infrastructure projects to create jobs and subsidies to states to keep teachers and first responders in their jobs. Republicans have blocked much of the package because Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats proposed to offset the cost of the package with higher taxes on the wealthiest individuals. Congress and Mr. Obama agreed in December to a two-month extension of the current worker payroll tax relief and are negotiating on a full-year extension, but the partisan split over how to pay for the tax cut remains.
- 
9:57 P.M. | Fact Check: Paul on Overseas Bases
Representative Ron Paul's argument for closing American bases overseas goes to a critical question in American defense strategy: In the long run, is it more or less expensive to keep troops "forward deployed'?
It is not an easy question to answer, but it is also not as black and white as Mr. Paul made it sound. Some major allies, like Japan, pay to keep American troops on their soil. And in many cases, keeping troops abroad is considered a way to deter bad behavior - that is why the Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, is focused on keeping the Strait of Hormuz open, despite Iranian threats.
- 
9:56 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney's 120,000 Jobs
While defending his record as a corporate buyout specialist at Bain Capital, Mitt Romney said tonight that companies he had invested in while at Bain "ended up today having some 120,000 jobs." That number is slightly higher than the usual figure Mr. Romney cites on the campaign trail for job creation under Bain's supervision - 100,000 - and neither number tells the full story.
Mr. Romney arrives at the 100,000 jobs number by combining the current employment figures of three main companies that Bain Capital invested in - Staples, Sports Authority and Domino's Pizza. (He sometimes also includes a fourth company, Steel Dynamics). However, that number only addresses a small group of companies that Mr. Romney was successful in starting or turning around, and does not take into account the less successful companies that Bain Capital invested in, some of which went bankrupt or were forced to lay off workers. It is also worth noting that Bain Capital was not always a controlling investor in these companies.
Tonight, according to his campaign, Mr. Romney was specifically referring to four start-up companies - Staples, Sports Authority, Bright Horizons and Steel Dynamics. 
As Mr. Romney himself has said previously, not every company Bain Capital took over was successful, and some first cut jobs in order to grow. Mr. Romney's 100,000 figure (or, in the case of tonight's debate, the 120,000 figure) only takes into account his successful instances of job creation, and does not offset the number of jobs created by the number of jobs lost.
- 
9:51 P.M. | Romney's Tax Returns
It appears that the pressure to release his tax returns has finally gotten to Mitt Romney. 
Maybe.
Asked directly whether he would release his tax returns, Mr. Romney - who is said to be worth as much as $250 million - said that he was "happy to do so," but didn't quite commit.
"If that's been the tradition, I'm not opposed to doing that. Time will tell," he said, noting that he might be asked to do it in April. "I'll keep that open."
That's different from what he told reporters a few weeks ago, when he said he did not intend to release his tax returns.
"I doubt it," Mr. Romney said in December, according to a transcript of an interview provided by NBC News. "I will provide all the financial info, which is an extraordinary pile of documents which show investments and so forth."
"But you won't do the tax returns?" asked Chuck Todd, host of "The Daily Rundown."
"I don't intend to release the tax returns. I don't," Mr. Romney responded.
At the debate tonight, Mr. Romney seemed to have changed his mind, at least on the likelihood of whether he will eventually release them.
"If I become our nominee," he said of the question about releasing his returns, "that's probably what I'd do."
- 
9:48 P.M. | Paul on Cutting Defense Spending 
How can you tell this debate is taking place in South Carolina? 
How about a new line of argument from Ron Paul?
Mr. Paul, a famously antiwar Republican, has always railed against defense spending, saying that the country could save billions if not trillions by pulling back the military from the wars abroad.
Now, however, he's campaigning in a state with a very high proportion of military families and veterans. And so he's added a new bit to his argument.
"You still don't understand," Mr. Paul said to the moderators. "There's a difference between military spending and defense spending."
In a nutshell, Mr. Paul suggested that he could cut spending on the military - by pulling back from the wars - but increase spending on what he called "defense" at home.

9:45 P.M. | Romney Avoiding Confrontation 
If there was any question about whether Mitt Romney was going to mix it up with his rivals tonight, that has now been put to rest.
Mitt Romney appears determined to respond calmly, with a smile, to whatever is thrown at him - but not to get dragged into a confrontation that could spiral out of control or get under his skin.
Rick Santorum clearly tried to engage him a few minutes ago, with little success. Mr. Romney did not get emotional with Mr. Santorum or try to barrel over his answer.
Instead, Mr. Romney's approach seems to be designed to offer a few facts in rebuttal and quickly pivot to his message - a critique of President Obama and a statement of his own belief in capitalism and free enterprise.
Mr. Romney is at the top of the Republican field right now, and he clearly doesn't want to do anything to jeopardize that.
His rivals may try to pull him into more exchanges in an attempt to rattle him. But so far, Mr. Romney has not been very accommodating.

9:42 P.M. | Voters' Voices: No Love Lost for Huntsman
There's not a lot of love lost in our group for Jon M. Huntsman Jr., who dropped out of the race today.
"Who?" Mary King jokes.
"Can I be honest?" said her friend Kaleigh Smith. "I have never heard his name before."
This is a proud hometown crowd. The debate auditorium appears on the TV screen. 
"That's the Myrtle Beach Convention Center!" Mike King said. "That's where the gun show was."
The one thing our group can agree on: Representative Ron Paul of Texas is the odd man out on stage.
"This is a grumpy old man," said Shawna Whitaker, another friend of Ms. Smith's.
"He reminds me of Dumbledore," Ms. Smith said.
"He's funny," Mr. King said. "Isn't that like an old man to get funny on you?"
But the big question: Whom will you vote for on Saturday? Some in our group are leaning toward Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House. But Ms. Smith prefers Mitt Romney. 
"I just like him," she says as Mr. Romney appears on screen. "He seems confident."
But Ms. Whitaker thinks Mr. Romney seems like "a know-it-all." Being smart and good-looking isn't enough, she says. "Some people considered Bill Clinton charismatic and good-looking."
Mr. King, a Southern Baptist pastor, wants a candidate who speaks from the heart. "It seems like Romney is telling you what he thinks you want, not what he really believes," he said. "You can see when someone's giving you the party line or speaking from their soul."
- 
9:40 P.M. | Fact Check: 'Super PAC' Coordination 
When Mitt Romney was criticized tonight for attack ads that a "super PAC" supporting him has run against his opponents, he dismissed the suggestion that he could do anything about it.
"That's something that's completely out of the control of candidates," Mr. Romney protested.
In the narrowest sense, he's right. The ads that Restore Our Future - a super PAC supporting Mr. Romney's bid - have run against Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry and Rick Santorum would be plainly illegal if Mr. Romney had signed off on them. But Mr. Romney is suggesting a level of detachment from Restore Our Future that is at odds with reality.
Like super PACs supporting other candidates, Restore Our Future is run by three of Mr. Romney's former campaign aides and financed by his top donors. Mr. Romney and his campaign are barred by law from coordinating with them when it comes to expenditures in the presidential race. But the group and its work is effectively blessed by Mr. Romney, who appeared last summer at a meeting of potential donors.
Moreover, while Mr. Romney is not allowed to direct the group's activities, the law leaves plenty of running room for Mr. Romney to make his broader sentiments known. It would not violate the law, for example, for Mr. Romney to say publicly that he would prefer that any super PAC supporting him not wage any attacks on his opponents. Nor would it violate the law for Restore Our Future to heed Mr. Romney's wishes under that scenario. And the same goes for any of the super PACs backing other candidates, which have run ads critical of Mr. Romney, too.
- 
9:38 P.M. | Romney Finds an Answer for Question on Flip-Flops
The defense that Mr. Romney always reaches for when he is accused of changing his point of view? The time that he changed his view on abortion.
What was once seen as a significant problem for Mr. Romney - his flip-flop on a key social issue for conservatives - is now embraced by Mr. Romney as evidence of how a change can be heartfelt.
Will it work? Mr. Romney's campaign clearly believes in the explanation that he sincerely changed his mind. They think voters will accept it as well.
And it also has the benefit of responding to a tough question about multiple flip-flops on a series of issues with an answer about one single issue.
- 
9:36 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney's Record on Taxes
Mr. Gingrich declared that Mr. Romney "raised taxes" as governor of Massachusetts. Mr. Romney argues that he actually reduced taxes 19 times.
Mr. Romney is correct. So is Mr. Gingrich - sort of. Mr. Romney, who ran for governor on a pledge of no new taxes, closed about a dozen loopholes that allowed Massachusetts corporations to avoid paying various taxes. Corporations in the state viewed the moves as tax increases, as did Grover Norquist, the influential head of Americans for Tax Reform; Mr. Romney rejected that description, saying he was merely demanding that companies pay their fair share.
By the end of Mr. Romney's term, the loophole closings required companies to pay about $370 million a year in additional taxes, a nearly 20 percent increase from the period before he took office, according to an analysis of government data by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a nonprofit research group that receives financing from corporations.
The Romney administration also increased dozens of fees for Massachusetts residents and business (like the cost of a road test for a commercial driver's license, to $40 from $20).
As with the loophole closings, these were not taxes, per se, but close to it, critics said. But the distinction is crucial for Mr. Romney, who has long run on an antitax campaign message.
- 
9:33 P.M. | A Sharp Exchange Between Santorum and Romney
An exchange between Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum just now is a reflection of the tension that has built up between the two of them.
Mr. Santorum has grown increasingly angry over the last two days over an accusation about his support for a voting rights bill from a "super PAC" backing Mr. Romney.
Prodded by Mr. Santorum to say whether he supported giving voting rights to felons once they have completed their sentences, Mr. Romney said: "I don't think people who have committed violent crimes should be able to vote again. That's my view."
Mr. Santorum was clearly ready for that answer, noting that as governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Romney did nothing to change just such a law.
But the substance of the issue may be less significant than the exchange that it sparked, as Mr. Santorum sought repeatedly to directly engage Mr. Rommey.
He repeatedly directed questions about the ad at Mr. Romney, prodding him to take responsibility for the PAC's handiwork.
Mr. Romney rejected that argument, repeatedly saying that he has no control over what the super PACs do. But Mr. Santorum refused to accept that.
If such a group were saying something inaccurate, Mr. Santorum said, "I would go out and say: 'Stop it. You are representing me.' "
Look for more exchanges between the two men as the debate proceeds.
- 
9:20 P.M. | Gingrich on the Defensive
It's Mr. Gingrich on the defensive right at the start about his attacks on Mr. Romney.
A debate moderator, Bret Baier, decided to start the debate off by asking Mr. Gingrich whether his attacks on Mr. Romney's record at Bain Capital violate his own complaints about negative campaigning.
"If that's a part of your campaign, then questioning it has to be equally legitimate," Mr. Gingrich responded. "We need to satisfy the country that whoever we nominate has a record that can stand up to Barack Obama in a very effective way."
Mr. Gingrich has gone after Mr. Romney, as has a "super PAC" backing Mr. Gingrich's candidacy. Mr. Gingrich did not repeat his attacks, but defended raising the questions. 
"I have raised questions that I think are legitimate questions," Mr. Gingrich said. "The governor has every opportunity to answer those questions."
Mr. Romney responded calmly and coolly, arguing that during his tenure at Bain, jobs were added at some companies but lost at others.
"Free enterprise, with all of its different dimensions and players, makes the United States the strongest country in the world," Mr. Romney said a few minutes later.
"I know that people are going to come after me," Mr. Romney said. "But the record is pretty darn good."
- 
9:15 P.M. | Perry Prods Romney on Tax Returns
Rick Perry just put Mitt Romney on the spot, urging him to release his tax returns.
"Mitt, we need for you to release your income tax so the people of this country can see," Mr. Perry said.
Mr. Romney, a multimillionaire, has said he has no plans to release his tax returns. Mr. Perry said that's not good enough.
"Here's the real issue for us," Mr. Perry said. "We cannot fire our nominee in September. We need to know now."
Given the opportunity to respond, Mr. Romney ignored the request.

9:02 P.M. | Voters' Voices: Still Searching for a Candidate 
Our group is the King family. That's Michael King, 49, a Southern Baptist pastor; his wife, Lisa King, 48; and their daughter, Mary King, a high school student who turns 18 next month.
The Kings haven't decided which Republican presidential candidate to support. So they've invited some of Mary's friends over. Everyone is eating jalapeno-flavored Cheetos, chips and salsa, and gummy candy. We're watching Fox News and getting ready for the debate to start.
"We'll see how things go," Mr. King said. "All of the candidates have got their baggage."
- 
8:50 P.M. | Guide to Romney Debate Prep
Ever wonder about the debate prep that candidates undergo before one of these nationally televised forums? 
Aides to Mitt Romney insist that his prep sessions this time around are less formal - more like a conversation around a table with a handful of aides.
Eric Fehrnstrom, a top Romney adviser, sent this Twitter message today during an exchange with David Axelrod, one of President Obama's top political advisers: 
@davidaxelrod Haha! Believe it or not, the economy is an issue where we don't prep Mitt, he preps us.
And here's a bit from an article I wrote in October with my colleague Ashley Parker: 
When Mitt Romney crammed for the Republican presidential debates four years ago, he went all out: The campaign built a stage with four lecterns and used senior staff members as stand-ins for his rivals, John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani. A room packed with highly paid media consultants and senior officials barked suggestions as they flipped through a white binder filled with policy positions. Over time, one aide said, the binder grew to resemble the Manhattan White Pages.
This month, when Mr. Romney prepared for his seventh debate of the 2012 campaign, at Dartmouth College, there were no lecterns. No one playing Rick Perry or Herman Cain. And no overstuffed policy binders. Mr. Romney and a few aides simply sat around a small table at the Hanover Inn in New Hampshire and batted around topics in the news.
- 
8:43 P.M. | A Question to Ponder
Here's a question to ponder as the candidates prepare to take the stage in a few minutes .
Will Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum go after Mitt Romney tonight, or will they decide that they need to focus their rhetorical fire on each other?
Both scenarios are plausible.
According to polls, Mr. Romney is leading in South Carolina, and Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich could easily decide that a fight between them is meaningless if they let Mr. Romney run away with first place.
But it's just as easy to think that the two men might conclude that the only thing standing in the way of a serious challenge to Mr. Romney is the other one.
We'll know the answer in just a few minutes.
- 
8:08 P.M. | And Then There Were Five ...
A dwindling group of Republican presidential contenders - now just five - will debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., tonight as the party lurches closer toward choosing its nominee.
The departure of Jon M. Huntsman Jr. from the race on Monday morning helps clarify the political dynamics that should play out on the debate stage with just five days left before voters here go to the polls.
Each of the candidates will get more time to make his case. Even before Mr. Huntsman dropped out, Fox News, the sponsor of the debate, announced that it would allow 90 seconds for answers rather than a minute.
But the smaller field of candidates and the desire by Mitt. Romney's rivals to stop his march toward the nomination may sharpen the potential for personal attacks.

HEADLINE: London Wants to Tap Chinese Currency Market

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: Britain plans to turn London into a major foreign exchange trading center for the Chinese renminbi to benefit from faster growth in Asia while strengthening the city's position as a financial center. 

 BODY:
LONDON -- Britain plans to turn London into a major foreign exchange trading center for the Chinese renminbi to benefit from faster growth in Asia while strengthening the city's position as a financial center in the wake of the banking crisis.
George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said during a visit to Hong Kong on Monday that he was working with Chinese and British banks to establish London as a new hub for the renminbi market.
"London is perfectly placed to act as a gateway for Asian banking and investment in Europe, and a bridge to the United States," Mr. Osborne said in a speech to the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong. "This is not just an accident of time zone, or our language, although both are important. It reflects London's strength in product development, its regulatory structure, and the depth, breadth and international reach of its financial markets."
The pledge comes as Britain is increasingly feeling the effects of an economic slowdown across Europe, and some British banks have threatened to move their headquarters abroad in light of stricter financial regulation. 
The government hopes that steps toward creating a Chinese currency hub in London will help strengthen the city's role as a financial center vis-a-vis New York and Hong Kong, while helping Britain attract Chinese investments in other sectors, including infrastructure.
Mr. Osborne said London was already the largest foreign exchange market in the world, adding that the growing use of the renminbi would "bring substantial benefit to Chinese economic development and the wider world economy."
The Chinese currency's share of the global foreign exchange market was 0.9 percent in June last year, Mr. Osborne said. That compares with China's share in worldwide trade of 11 percent in 2010. "It is clear that there is scope for substantial expansion of the renminbi market in the coming years," Mr. Osborne said.
Sebastien Galy, a foreign exchange strategist at Societe Generale in London, agreed with Mr. Osborne that London's geographical position allowed it to play a role in the expansion of the currency market, but he said it would take time for that market to grow to a sizable volume.
"It could take decades to achieve that, which doesn't mean that the renminbi wouldn't increase in trading volumes in the meantime," Mr. Galy said. "There are regional issues, their markets are not developed enough yet and also you need a floating currency."
In a first step to expand the currency trading, Hong Kong has decided to expand the operating hours of its renminbi settlement system by five hours. China has been using its currency more in international trade to reduce its reliance on the dollar.

HEADLINE: Huntsman Leaves Race With Plea for Party Unity

BYLINE: JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: Aides to Jon M. Huntsman Jr.said he believed it would be better for the party if he pulled out now. 

 BODY:
11:36 a.m. | Updated MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. - Former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. of Utah formally ended his once-promising Republican presidential run with a call for party unity, asking the five candidates he leaves on the field to end their negative ads and chastising President Obama for engaging in "class warfare."
"This race has degenerated into an onslaught of negative and personal attacks not worthy of the American people and not worthy of this critical time in our nation's history," he said in an address before a packed room of television cameras and reporters at the Convention Center here.
"I call on each campaign to cease attacking each other and instead talk directly to the American people about how our conservative ideas will create jobs, reduce our nation's debt, stabilize energy prices and provide a brighter future for our children and our grandchildren.''
But he had stern words as well for Mr. Obama, for whom he worked as ambassador to China until last spring, when he came home to start his presidential campaign.
"Three years ago the president promised to unite the American people," he said. "Yet his desire to engage in class warfare for political gain has left us more divided than ever."
Mr. Huntsman said the party needed to work to focus on the goal of beating Mr. Obama in November and coalesce behind Mr. Romney, with whom he at times fought fiercely during the course of his six-month campaign.
"I believe it is now time for our party to unite around the candidate best equipped to defeat Barack Obama,'' he said. "Despite our differences and the space between us on some of the issues, I believe that candidate is Governor Mitt Romney."
Mr. Huntsman announced his departure from the presidential race flanked by his wife and daughters, and with his father in the wings, after speaking by telephone on Sunday night to Mr. Romney, aides to Mr. Huntsman said.
Mr. Huntsman told Mr. Romney he would have his full support. And a strategist said that later on Monday, Mr. Huntsman would record a telephone call in which he would emphasize his support for Mr. Romney. That call will go out to voters identified as being supportive of Mr. Huntsman, many of whom live along the coast here.
But the quadrennial, primary season ritual of also-ran candidates endorsing opponents with whom they had sparred mightily just days earlier was on display in all of its awkwardness on Monday.
Mr. Huntsman hardly waxed poetic about Mr. Romney, whom he had been harshly critical of for months, giving him a single sentence five minutes into his nearly nine-minute-long speech. Mr. Romney said nothing about the endorsement until more than 30 minutes after Mr. Huntsman officially made it; though both men were here in Myrtle Beach during the day, and Mr. Huntsman's schedule was decidedly free after his address, there were no plans to appear together.
Mr. Huntsman took no questions after his speech, and it was clear why. As he left the stage, reporters shouted a series of uncomfortable queries: "Two weeks ago you said Governor Romney is completely out of touch"; "You recently said Governor Romney was unelectable because he lacks a core"; and, "Do you still think he's out of touch and unelectable?"
Just last week, in Concord, N.H., Mr. Huntsman criticized Mr. Romney for his comment that he liked "to be able to fire people who provide services to me" - uttered as part of his call for better consumer options to change health care providers that they are unhappy with - by saying: "Governor Romney enjoys firing people; I enjoy creating jobs. It may be that he's slightly out of touch with the economic reality playing out in America right now."
On Monday, Democrats were seizing on his comments during an appearance on "Meet the Press" in November, when Mr. Huntsman said of Mr. Romney, "When you're on too many sides of the issues of the day, when you don't have that core, when there's that element of trust out there, I think that becomes a problem, and I think it makes you unelectable against Barack Obama."
But perhaps the men's tensest moment came in the "Meet the Press"/Facebook debate in Concord on Jan. 8, when Mr. Huntsman took Mr. Romney to task for criticizing his service as Mr. Obama's ambassador to China. "He criticized me while he was out raising money for serving my country in China," he said. "Yes, under a Democrat. Like what my two sons are doing in the United States Navy. They're not asking who-- what political affiliation the president is."
After Mr. Romney dug in by saying, "The person who should represent our party running against President Obama is not someone who called him a remarkable leader and went to be his ambassador to China,'' Mr. Huntsman told the debate moderator, David Gregory, "This nation is divided, David, because of attitudes like that."
Mr. Huntsman's aides said he had made the decision to drop out after he came to believe that he would only be playing the role of spoiler in Saturday's primary here. He does not believe, aides said, that a protracted battle between Mr. Romney and a more conservative alternative would be helpful to the party in its goal of defeating Mr. Obama in the fall.
Mr. Huntsman came to the decision after consulting with his family and his campaign aides, a strategist said. A close look at his poll numbers showed that he would be drawing support solely from Mr. Romney, and that he appeared far short of victory.
Aides said that in spite of his declaration that he had "a ticket to ride" with his third-place showing in New Hampshire, Mr. Huntsman was more deflated than he let on, given the late predictions that he would place second. And he carried on here only ambivalently, buoyed by the crowds that initially greeted him but unable to get around the idea that after Saturday he would be no closer to turning his electoral fate around - and that if anything, he would be only prolonging what he came to see as Mr. Romney's inexorable march to the nomination.
Also, by continuing an attempt to derail Mr. Romney, Mr. Huntsman would have been in danger of alienating critical supporters in the Mormon and Utah business communities with whom he and Mr. Romney share connections, and who would be critical to any future presidential run he may decide to make.
Aides said Mr. Huntsman felt as if he could leave the race without shame, given that he had entered as a virtual unknown, edged his way into the top tier of candidates in New Hampshire and won endorsements from major publications including The Boston Globe and The State, in South Carolina.
While there was some discussion about remaining in the race through the primary here on Saturday, Mr. Huntsman decided he did not want to carry on any longer, given that his only possible accomplishment would be to erode Mr. Romney's natural base of support and help Rick Santorum or Newt Gingrich.
"We ran a very principled race,'' said John Weaver, Mr. Huntsman's chief strategist, "and he should be proud of that. But at the end of the day it was a steep hill to climb, too steep."
It remains an open question what electoral effect - if any - the Huntsman endorsement will have on Mr. Romney in the six-day countdown to the South Carolina primary.
The endorsement may not significantly change the shape of the race, but it could inject a new dynamic into a debate Monday night on the Fox News Channel. With the Republican field winnowed to five candidates, the rivals will have more time to make their case to voters and could use Mr. Huntsman's endorsement of Mr. Romney to bolster their own arguments.
Mr. Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, said Monday that the endorsement was not surprising. He dismissed its significance, declaring, "Moderates are backing moderates."
"That's sort of the bottom line. No surprise there," Mr. Santorum said at a morning campaign stop in Columbia. "Governor Huntsman ran as a moderate, trying to compete with Governor Romney for the establishment moderate vote."
Mr. Santorum reminded voters of his strong showing in Iowa, where the electorate is more similar to voters in South Carolina, and urged social conservatives to rally behind his candidacy. He has stopped short of calling for his rivals to follow Mr. Huntsman's lead and drop out of the race, but he argued that he, not Mr. Gingrich, was the more electable conservative in the race.
"Congressman Gingrich talks about how he's the most electable," Mr. Santorum said. "Then why did he finish behind me in the first two contests if he's so electable?"

HEADLINE: Four Evangelical Leaders Reaffirm Support for Gingrich

BYLINE: ERIK ECKHOLM


HIGHLIGHT: The four leaders said initial news accounts of a "consensus" in support of Rick Santorum were incorrect. 

 BODY:
1:04 p.m. | Updated Four Christian conservative leaders who attended a meeting of evangelicals in Texas last week issued a statement Monday reiterating their firm support for Newt Gingrich. 
After the meeting ended on Saturday, Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, announced that a "supermajority" had coalesced around Rick Santorum in the hope that a more unified evangelical vote could stop Mitt Romney and result in the nomination of a more reliable conservative. He said that participants had voted 85 to 29 to support Mr. Santorum.
But Mr. Gingrich's supporters called the tally misleading because several pro-Gingrich participants had left before the final vote. While acknowledging that Mr. Santorum had won majority support, they said that initial news accounts of a "consensus" were incorrect. 
"It is unfortunate that early press reports incorrectly stated that there was a consensus for Santorum, or that the '150 leaders endorsed Santorum.' Such was not the case. Many there were and still are for Newt Gingrich," said a statement issued Monday by J.C. Watts, a former Oklahoma congressman and a leading African-American conservative who is now a consultant; George Barna, a prominent Christian political analyst; the Rev. Jim Garlow, pastor of Skyline Church in La Mesa, Calif., and a leader of the campaign against same-sex marriage; and Richard Lee, a prominent Baptist pastor in Atlanta.
"While we truly respect both Rick Santorum and Rick Perry, we believe Newt Gingrich to be the only candidate that has the intellectual strength and the capacity to stop the left's attack on morality, the economy, basic freedoms and our religious liberty." 
The statement added: "In addition Mr. Gingrich is the social conservative that has the capacity to raise funds and produce a national organization that would allow him to compete with and defeat Barak Obama. For the sake of the nation, we remain steadfastly committed to Newt Gingrich." 
In an e-mail, Matthew D. Staver, dean of the Liberty University Law School, said that the only consensus among "evangelical and faith leaders centers on values for any nominee and not for any particular candidate." Mr. Staver, who was in Israel at the time of the meeting, is a co-chairman of a faith coalition that supports Mr. Gingrich. Other co-chairman include Mr. Garlow, Mr. Barna and Donald E. Wildmon, the founder of the American Family Association.

Reactions
Let's journey back in time, all the way back to Iowa, when Newt Gingrich was waging an all-positive campaign and Rick Perry was actually campaigning.
On the day of the Iowa caucuses, The Daily Beast's Andrew Romano wrote a post comparing the campaigns of Mitt Romney and Mr. Perry. It's still worth a read. Mr. Romano, in an echo of this FiveThirtyEight post, highlighted a principle difference between the two campaigns: "Mitt is focused like a laser on the economy down the homestretch, while the Texas governor is all over the map."
Also on the day of the Iowa caucuses, FiveThirtyEight projected Mr. Romney as the favorite in Iowa. Just before caucusing began, however, Nate wrote "Why I'd Bet on Santorum (and Against My Model)."
Well, Justin Wolfers, an Associate Professor of Business and Public Policy at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, happily took Nate up on the offer:
The New Yorker's John Cassidy also took Rick Santorum in a bet with Mr. Wolfers. Of course, Mr. Wolfers, backing Mr. Romney, won both bets.
Actually, Mr. Wolfers's triumph was much less muddled than Mr. Romney's. Although declared the victor by eight votes in the early hours of Jan. 4, accounts of a vote-counting discrepancy surfaced soon afterward. The Republican Party of Iowa decided not to change the results, but in the end FiveThirtyEight's conflicted position oddly mirrored the real-world confusion.
Our colleague David Carr, at The Times' Media Decoder blog, observed that Mr. Romney's win, however slim, "earned him a nice temporary title going into the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday night: Winner." Indeed, Mr. Carr's point -- no matter how ambiguous the result, the titles bestowed by the press afterward are usually unambiguous -- was highlighted after Mr. Romney's romp in New Hampshire, where he was given a longer but more unique title: the first non-incumbent Republican to win both Iowa and New Hampshire.
Another unambiguous outcome of Iowa was the damage done to Mr. Perry's viability by his 5th place finish, and it was unsurprising when Mr. Perry chose to return to Texas to reassess his candidacy. But when Mr. Perrychose to stay in the race, a simple question rolled off many politically attuned tongues: why?
FiveThirtyEight tried toanswer that question, settling on an explanation one part personal (wanting to finish the campaign on an up-note) and three parts strategic (advisers, activists and party elders may have urged him to stay the course, a course they believed could end in the nomination). The Washington Examiner's Michael Barone said neither part of FiveThirtyEight's explanation "seems persuasive to me." Mr. Barone, instead, suggests that Mr. Perry stayed in the race because of Tim Pawlenty.
Mr. Pawlenty, you will remember, left the Republican nomination fight in August, before surge after surge (after surge after surge) swept through the field. Many commentators have wondered since if Mr. Pawlenty might not surged himself had he stayed in the race. And -- this line of thought goes -- because he had more establishment support and more traditional credentials, the Pawlenty surge might have been more durable.
So Mr. Barone suggested the specter of Pawlenty's "missed opportunity" led Mr. Perry to conclude, "Let's stay in. Our chances of winning may be as low as 2 percent. But if we get out, they are, like Tim Pawlenty's, zero. What have we got to lose?"
Reads
David Rothschild, at The Signal blog, analyzed how prediction markets performed during the Iowa caucuses. Alan Boyle, at MSNBC's Cosmic Log blog, also checked in on how prediction markets have been faring.
Gallup's Jeffrey M. Jones (here) and The Huffington Post's Mark Blumenthal (here) both saw significance in Mitt Romney's recent rise in national polls.
Ezra Klein, writing at Bloomberg, peeled away the obfuscations and contradictions that make up many of the employment claims made by campaigns.
Slate's Sasha Issenberg profiled the Obama campaign's resident data-driven forecaster.
Nathaniel Rakich, at the Baseballot blog, made a statistical argument for the Miami Marlins' new ballpark boosting next season's attendance (then played devil's advocate to himself).
This study seems particularly relevant given the recent intraparty attacks on Mitt Romney. "Narrow Victories and Hard Games: Revisiting the Primary Divisiveness Hypothesis," published in American Politics Research, tested how much negativity during the Hillary Clinton - President Obama primary hurt Mr. Obama in the general election.

HEADLINE: What to Watch for in Tonight's Debate

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The departure of Jon M. Huntsman Jr. from the race helps clarify the political dynamics that should play out on the debate stage with just five days left before voters here go to the polls. 

 BODY:
A dwindling group of Republican presidential contenders -- now just five -- will debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., tonight as the party lurches closer toward choosing its nominee.
The departure of Jon M. Huntsman Jr. from the race on Monday morning helps clarify the political dynamics that should play out on the debate stage with just five days left before voters here go to the polls.
Mitt Romney is now the lone voice in the race seeking the approval of the Republican establishment as he tries to close out his second bid to become his party's standard-bearer. 
Challenging him from the right are three rivals, each hoping that social conservatives in the state will find them a suitable alternative to Mr. Romney: Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker; Rick Santorum, the former senator from Pennsylvania; and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas.
And Representative Ron Paul of Texas remains in the race as he makes the case that none of the other candidates represent the wholesale change to the economic and political system necessary to revive the country's fortunes. 
With just five candidates on the stage tonight, each will get more time to make his case. Even before Mr. Huntsman dropped out, Fox News, the sponsor of the debate, announced that it would allow 90 seconds for answers rather than a minute.
But the smaller field of candidates and the desire by Mr. Romney's rivals to stop his march toward the nomination may sharpen the potential for personal attacks. 
"Super PACs" have been pouring millions of dollars into such attacks in recent days, but even their reach does not compare to the millions of viewers likely to watch the debate.
With that in mind, here are some things to watch for in Monday's debate:
1. Mr. Romney: First and foremost, Mr. Romney must avoid making mistakes. He is the clear leader in the polls, but there are five days to go until the primary -- plenty of time for the tide to turn if he were to make a gaffe or present rivals with a fresh opportunity to question his leadership.
Second, Mr. Romney must find a way to succinctly answer the criticism of his role at Bain Capital, the venture capital firm he once led. The attack has prompted a backlash of sorts against Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Perry, but it remains a potential drag on his support here. Look for him to try to put the issue to rest.
And with two victories under his belt, Mr. Romney is hoping to use his time in South Carolina to broaden his appeal and look like the inevitable nominee. He may seek to add a discussion of social issues to his normal answers about the economy. And he will almost certainly train his harshest rhetoric on President Obama as he tries to look the part of the party's standard-bearer.
2. The Conservatives: For the three candidates on the stage vying for the social conservative vote, the most crucial mission is to stop Mr. Romney. That task may be easier without Representative Michele Bachmann, Mr. Huntsman or Herman Cain on the stage, diverting attention from their goal.
That probably means pressing the attacks on Mr. Romney's time at Bain, though doing so risks more criticism from Republican voters that they are attacking free enterprise and capitalism. (Mr. Romney is sure to make that case, and could be aided by Mr. Santorum, who has sought to benefit by refusing to take part in the Bain attacks.)
Less clear is how much the three social conservatives will take aim at each other in the hopes of emerging as the one, true alternative to Mr. Romney. Mr Perry, who appears to be struggling at the bottom of the polls, is probably less of a threat to the others. But Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich each know that beating the other may be the only way to continue on to Florida and beyond.
One thing that is likely no matter what is that the debate will focus on issues like same-sex marriage, abortion, gun rights and other concerns of the state's evangelical voters. One thing that is not likely is any criticism of Mr. Romney's Mormon faith. (Though it's possible that the subject -- and how it plays among religious voters -- could be brought up by a debate moderator.)
3. Ron Paul: Having increased his share of the vote since his last White House bid in 2008, Mr. Paul shows no signs of dropping out anytime soon -- even if he continues to lag behind Mr. Romney or if he drops behind other rivals.
But the impact of Mr. Paul's "revolution" on the presidential conversation still depends on his success in attracting votes, and South Carolina may be his toughest state yet. There is less evidence that students or independents will turn out in large numbers in a primary that is typically dominated by conservative, evangelical voters.
Mr. Paul's debate performances have been remarkably consistent, so watch for more of the same. But keep an eye out for a new and aggressive focus on Mr. Romney. If the perceived front-runner can be slowed down, that probably extends Mr. Paul's time in the national spotlight.

HEADLINE: A Twitter War Between Axelrod and Fehrnstrom

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Using Twitter, two top advisers for President Obama and Mitt Romney go at it, in 140 characters or less. 

 BODY:
It did not even take the full 140-characters to start the Great Twitter War Monday afternoon.
In fact, it started innocently enough, just after noon, with a Twitter posting from @MittRomney, the Mitt Romney Twitter account.
@MittRomney Mitt Romney
More Americans have lost their jobs under @BarackObama than any president in modern history. http://t.co/CyCSpY9M
Mon Jan 16 17:27:13 via Mitt Romney
A few hours later, David Axelrod, the longtime strategist for President Obama, offered up a reply to Mr. Romney.
@davidaxelrod David Axelrod
. @MittRomney A picture's worth a thousand misleading words. This chart tells the story.http://bit.ly/z4V0Us
Mon Jan 16 20:19:30 via David Axelrod
Mr. Axelrod included a link to a graph on the Obama campaign's Web site, which cited the Bureau of Labor Statistics to show 22 consecutive months of job growth.
Fifteen minutes later, Eric Fehrnstrom, a top adviser to Mr. Romney, replied to Mr. Axelrod, with a posting that hit back.
@EricFehrn Eric Fehrnstrom
.@davidaxelrod Sometimes you don't need a picture to tell a story. The numbers speak for themselves - 1.7 million jobs lost under Obama.
Mon Jan 16 20:36:48 via Eric Fehrnstrom
And then the two men were off, going back and forth in some 140-character rapid-fire debate day trash-talking that finally wound down nearly a dozen Twitter posts and more than two hours later, after Mr. Axelrod referred to Mr. Fehrnstrom as "Dude."
@davidaxelrod David Axelrod
@EricFehrn Dude, none of my business, but shouldn't you be in debate prep instead of trying to explain yourself to me?
Mon Jan 16 22:51:45 via David Axelrod
Mr. Fehrnstrom's reply: 
@EricFehrn Eric Fehrnstrom
@davidaxelrod Haha! Believe it or not, the economy is an issue where we don't prep Mitt, he preps us.

8:50 P.M. | Guide to Romney Debate Prep
Ever wonder about the debate prep that candidates undergo before one of these nationally televised forums? 
Aides to Mitt Romney insist that his prep sessions this time around are less formal - more like a conversation around a table with a handful of aides.
Eric Fehrnstrom, a top Romney adviser, sent this Twitter message today during an exchange with David Axelrod, one of President Obama's top political advisers: 
@davidaxelrod Haha! Believe it or not, the economy is an issue where we don't prep Mitt, he preps us.
And here's a bit from a story I wrote in October with my colleague Ashley Parker: 
When Mitt Romney crammed for the Republican presidential debates four years ago, he went all out: The campaign built a stage with four lecterns and used senior staff as stand-ins for his rivals, John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani. A room packed with highly paid media consultants and senior officials barked suggestions as they flipped through a white binder filled with policy positions. Over time, one aide said, the binder grew to resemble the Manhattan White Pages.
This month, when Mr. Romney prepared for his seventh debate of the 2012 campaign, at Dartmouth College, there were no lecterns. No one playing Rick Perry or Herman Cain. And no overstuffed policy binders. Mr. Romney and a few aides simply sat around a small table at the Hanover Inn in New Hampshire and batted around topics in the news.
- 
8:43 P.M. | A Question to Ponder
Here's a question to ponder as the candidates prepare to take the stage in a few minutes .
Will Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum go after Mitt Romney tonight, or will they decide that they need to focus their rhetorical fire on each other?
Both scenarios are plausible.
According to polls, Mr. Romney is leading in South Carolina, and Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich could easily decide that a fight between them is meaningless if they let Mr. Romney run away with first place.
But it's just as easy to think that the two men might conclude that the only thing standing in the way of a serious challenge to Mr. Romney is the other one.
We'll know the answer in just a few minutes.
- 
8:08 P.M. | And Then There Were Five...
A dwindling group of Republican presidential contenders - now just five - will debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., tonight as the party lurches closer toward choosing its nominee.
The departure of Jon M. Huntsman Jr. from the race on Monday morning helps clarify the political dynamics that should play out on the debate stage with just five days left before voters here go to the polls.
Each of the candidates will get more time to make his case. Even before Mr. Huntsman dropped out, Fox News, the sponsor of the debate, announced that it would allow 90 seconds for answers rather than a minute.
But the smaller field of candidates and the desire by Mitt. Romney's rivals to stop his march toward the nomination may sharpen the potential for personal attacks.

9:57 P.M. | Fact Check: Paul on Overseas Bases
Representative Ron Paul's attack on keeping American bases overseas goes to a critical question in American defense strategy: In the long run, is it more or less expensive to keep troops "forward deployed?"
It is not an easy question to answer, but it is also not as black-and-white as Mr. Paul made it sound. Some major allies, like Japan, pay to keep American troops on their soil. And in many cases, keeping troops abroad is considered a way to deter bad behavior - that is why the Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, is focused on keeping the Strait of Hormuz open, despite Iranian threats.
- 
9:56 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney's 120,000 Jobs
While defending his record as a corporate buyout specialist at Bain Capital, Mitt Romney said tonight that companies he had invested in while at Bain "ended up today having some 120,000 jobs." That number is slightly higher than the usual figure Mr. Romney cites on the campaign trail for job creation under Bain's supervision - 100,000 - and neither number tells the full story.
Mr. Romney arrives at the 100,000 jobs number by combining the current employment figures of three main companies that Bain Capital invested in - Staples, Sports Authority, and Domino's Pizza. (He sometimes also includes a fourth company, Steel Dynamics). However, that number only addresses a small group of companies that Mr. Romney was successful in starting or turning around, and does not take into account the less successful companies that Bain Capital invested in, some of which went bankrupt or were forced to layoff workers. It is also worth noting that Bain Capital was not a major investor in any of the four companies that Mr. Romney cites.
As Mr. Romney himself has said previously, not every company Bain Capital took over was successful, and some first cut jobs in order to grow. Mr. Romney's 100,000 figure (or, in the case of tonight's debate, Mr. Romney's slightly more inflated 120,000 figure) only takes into account his successful instances of job creation, and does not offset the number of jobs created with the number of jobs lost.
- 
9:51 P.M. | Romney's Tax Returns
It appears that the pressure to release his tax returns has finally gotten to Mitt Romney. 
Maybe.
Asked directly whether he would release his tax returns, Mr. Romney - who is said to be worth as much as $250 million - said that he was "happy to do so," but didn't quite commit.
"If that's been the tradition, I'm not opposed to doing that. Time will tell," he said, noting that he might be asked to do it in April. "I'll keep that open."
That's different from what he told reporters a few weeks ago, when he said he did not intend to release his tax returns.
"I doubt it," Mr. Romney said in December, according to a transcript of an interview provided by NBC News. "I will provide all the financial info, which is an extraordinary pile of documents which show investments and so forth."
"But you won't do the tax returns?" asked Chuck Todd, host of "The Daily Rundown."
"I don't intend to release the tax returns. I don't," Mr. Romney responded.
At the debate tonight, Mr. Romney seemed to have changed his mind, at least on the likelihood of whether he will eventually release them.
"If I become our nominee," he said of the question about releasing his returns, "that's probably what I'd do."
- 
9:48 P.M. | Paul on Cutting Defense Spending 
How can you tell this debate is taking place in South Carolina? 
How about a new line of argument from Ron Paul?
Mr. Paul, a famously antiwar Republican, has always railed against defense spending, saying that the country could save billions if not trillions by pulling back the military from the wars abroad.
Now, however, he's campaigning in a state with a very high proportion of military families and veterans. And so he's added a new bit to his argument.
"You still don't understand," Mr. Paul said to the moderators. "There's a difference between military spending and defense spending."
In a nutshell, Mr. Paul suggested that he could cut spending on the military - by pulling back from the wars - but increase spending on what he called "defense" at home.
- 
9:45 P.M. | Romney Avoiding Confrontation 
If there was any question about whether Mitt Romney was going to mix it up with his rivals tonight, that has now been put to rest.
Mitt Romney appears determined to respond calmly, with a smile, to whatever is thrown at him - but not to get dragged into a confrontation that could spiral out of control or get under his skin.
Rick Santorum clearly tried to engage him a few minutes ago, with little success. Mr. Romney did not get emotional with Mr. Santorum or try to barrel over his answer.
Instead, Mr. Romney's approach seems to be designed to offer a few facts in rebuttal and quickly pivot to his message - a critique of President Obama and a statement of his own belief in capitalism and free enterprise.
Mr. Romney is at the top of the Republican field right now, and he clearly doesn't want to do anything to jeopardize that.
His rivals may try to pull him into more exchanges in an attempt to rattle him. But so far, Mr. Romney has not been very accommodating.
- 
9:42 P.M. | Voters' Voices: No Love Lost for Huntsman
There's not a lot of love lost in our group for Jon M. Huntsman Jr., who dropped out of the race today.
"Who?" Mary King jokes.
"Can I be honest?" said her friend Kaleigh Smith. "I have never heard his name before."
This is a proud hometown crowd. The debate auditorium appears on the TV screen. 
"That's the Myrtle Beach Convention Center!" Mike King said. "That's where the gun show was."
The one thing our group can agree on: Representative Ron Paul of Texas is the odd man out on stage.
"This is a grumpy old man," said Shawna Whitaker, another friend of Ms. Smith's.
"He reminds me of Dumbledore," Ms. Smith said.
"He's funny," Mr. King said. "Isn't that like an old man to get funny on you?"
But the big question: Whom will you vote for on Saturday? Some in our group are leaning toward Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House. But Ms. Smith prefers Mitt Romney. 
"I just like him," she says as Mr. Romney appears on screen. "He seems confident."
But Ms. Whitaker thinks Mr. Romney seems like "a know-it-all." Being smart and good-looking isn't enough, she says. "Some people considered Bill Clinton charismatic and good-looking."
Mr. King, a Southern Baptist pastor, wants a candidate who speaks from the heart. "It seems like Romney is telling you what he thinks you want, not what he really believes," he said. "You can see when someone's giving you the party line or speaking from their soul."

9:40 P.M. | Fact Check: 'Super PAC' Coordination 
When Mitt Romney was criticized tonight for attack ads that a "super PAC" supporting him has run against his opponents, he dismissed the suggestion that he could do anything about it.
"That's something that's completely out of the control of candidates," Mr. Romney protested.
In the narrowest sense, he's right. The ads that Restore Our Future - a super PAC supporting Mr. Romney's bid - have run against Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry and Rick Santorum would be plainly illegal if Mr. Romney had signed off on them. But Mr. Romney is suggesting a level of detachment from Restore Our Future that is at odds with reality.
Like super PACs supporting other candidates, Restore Our Future is run by three of Mr. Romney's former campaign aides and financed by his top donors. Mr. Romney and his campaign are barred by law from coordinating with them when it comes to expenditures in the presidential race. But the group and its work is effectively blessed by Mr. Romney, who appeared last summer at a meeting of potential donors.
Moreover, while Mr. Romney is not allowed to direct the group's activities, the law leaves plenty of running room for Mr. Romney to make his broader sentiments known. It would not violate the law, for example, for Mr. Romney to say publicly that he would prefer that any super PAC supporting him not wage any attacks on his opponents. Nor would it violate the law for Restore Our Future to heed Mr. Romney's wishes under that scenario. And the same goes for any of the super PACs backing other candidates, which have run ads critical of Mr. Romney, too.
- 
9:38 P.M. | Romney Finds an Answer for Question on Flip-Flops
The defense that Mr. Romney always reaches for when he is accused of changing his point of view? The time that he changed his view on abortion.
What was once seen as a significant problem for Mr. Romney - his flip-flop on a key social issue for conservatives - is now embraced by Mr. Romney as evidence of how a change can be heartfelt.
Will it work? Mr. Romney's campaign clearly believes in the explanation that he sincerely changed his mind. They think voters will accept it as well.
And it also has the benefit of responding to a tough question about multiple flip-flops on a series of issues with an answer about one single issue.
- 
9:36 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney's Record on Taxes
Mr. Gingrich declared that Mr. Romney "raised taxes" as governor of Massachusetts. Mr. Romney argues that he actually reduced taxes 19 times.
Mr. Romney is correct. So is Mr. Gingrich - sort of. Mr. Romney, who ran for governor on a pledge of no new taxes, closed about a dozen loopholes that allowed Massachusetts corporations to avoid paying various taxes. Corporations in the state viewed the moves as tax increases, as did Grover Norquist, the influential head of Americans for Tax Reform; Mr. Romney rejected that description, saying he was merely demanding that companies pay their fair share.
By the end of Mr. Romney's term, the loophole closings required companies to pay about $370 million a year in additional taxes, a nearly 20 percent increase from the period before he took office, according to an analysis of government data by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a nonprofit research group that receives financing from corporations.
The Romney administration also increased dozens of fees for Massachusetts residents and business (like the cost of a road test for a commercial driver's license, to $40 from $20).
As with the loophole closings, these were not taxes, per se, but close to it, critics said. But the distinction is crucial for Mr. Romney, who has long run on an antitax campaign message.
- 
9:33 P.M. | A Sharp Exchange Between Santorum and Romney
An exchange between Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum just now is a reflection of the tension that has built up between the two of them.
Mr. Santorum has grown increasingly angry over the last two days over an accusation about his support for a voting rights bill from a "super PAC" backing Mr. Romney.
Prodded by Mr. Santorum to say whether he supported giving voting rights to felons once they have completed their sentences, Mr. Romney said: "I don't think people who have committed violent crimes should be able to vote again. That's my view."
Mr. Santorum was clearly ready for that answer, noting that as governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Romney did nothing to change just such a law.
But the substance of the issue may be less significant than the exchange that it sparked, as Mr. Santorum sought repeatedly to directly engage Mr. Rommey.
He repeatedly directed questions about the ad at Mr. Romney, prodding him to take responsibility for the PAC's handiwork.
Mr. Romney rejected that argument, repeatedly saying that he has no control over what the super PACs do. But Mr. Santorum refused to accept that.
If such a group were saying something inaccurate, Mr. Santorum said, "I would go out and say: 'Stop it. You are representing me.' "
Look for more exchanges between the two men as the debate proceeds.
- 
9:20 P.M. | Gingrich on the Defensive
It's Mr. Gingrich on the defensive right at the start about his attacks on Mr. Romney.
A debate moderator, Bret Baier, decided to start the debate off by asking Mr. Gingrich whether his attacks on Mr. Romney's record at Bain Capital violate his own complaints about negative campaigning.
"If that's a part of your campaign, then questioning it has to be equally legitimate," Mr. Gingrich responded. "We need to satisfy the country that whoever we nominate has a record that can stand up to Barack Obama in a very effective way."
Mr. Gingrich has gone after Mr. Romney, as has a "super PAC" backing Mr. Gingrich's candidacy. Mr. Gingrich did not repeat his attacks, but defended raising the questions. 
"I have raised questions that I think are legitimate questions," Mr. Gingrich said. "The governor has every opportunity to answer those questions."
Mr. Romney responded calmly and coolly, arguing that during his tenure at Bain, jobs were added at some companies but lost at others.
"Free enterprise, with all of its different dimensions and players, makes the United States the strongest country in the world," Mr. Romney said a few minutes later.
"I know that people are going to come after me," Mr. Romney said. "But the record is pretty darn good."
- 
9:15 P.M. | Perry Prods Romney on Tax Returns
Rick Perry just put Mitt Romney on the spot, urging him to release his tax returns.
"Mitt, we need for you to release your income tax so the people of this country can see," Mr. Perry said.
Mr. Romney, a multimillionaire, has said he has no plans to release his tax returns. Mr. Perry said that's not good enough.
"Here's the real issue for us," Mr. Perry said. "We cannot fire our nominee in September. We need to know now."
Given the opportunity to respond, Mr. Romney ignored the request.

9:02 P.M. | Voters' Voices: Still Searching for a Candidate 
Our group is the King family. That's Michael King, 49, a Southern Baptist pastor; his wife, Lisa King, 48; and their daughter, Mary King, a high school student who turns 18 next month.
The Kings haven't decided which Republican presidential candidate to support. So they've invited some of Mary's friends over. Everyone is eating jalapeno-flavored Cheetos, chips and salsa, and gummy candy. We're watching Fox News and getting ready for the debate to start.
"We'll see how things go," Mr. King said. "All of the candidates have got their baggage."

8:50 P.M. | Guide to Romney Debate Prep
Ever wonder about the debate prep that candidates undergo before one of these nationally televised forums? 
Aides to Mitt Romney insist that his prep sessions this time around are less formal - more like a conversation around a table with a handful of aides.
Eric Fehrnstrom, a top Romney adviser, sent this Twitter message today during an exchange with David Axelrod, one of President Obama's top political advisers: 
@davidaxelrod Haha! Believe it or not, the economy is an issue where we don't prep Mitt, he preps us.
And here's a bit from an article I wrote in October with my colleague Ashley Parker: 
When Mitt Romney crammed for the Republican presidential debates four years ago, he went all out: The campaign built a stage with four lecterns and used senior staff members as stand-ins for his rivals, John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani. A room packed with highly paid media consultants and senior officials barked suggestions as they flipped through a white binder filled with policy positions. Over time, one aide said, the binder grew to resemble the Manhattan White Pages.
This month, when Mr. Romney prepared for his seventh debate of the 2012 campaign, at Dartmouth College, there were no lecterns. No one playing Rick Perry or Herman Cain. And no overstuffed policy binders. Mr. Romney and a few aides simply sat around a small table at the Hanover Inn in New Hampshire and batted around topics in the news.
- 
8:43 P.M. | A Question to Ponder
Here's a question to ponder as the candidates prepare to take the stage in a few minutes .
Will Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum go after Mitt Romney tonight, or will they decide that they need to focus their rhetorical fire on each other?
Both scenarios are plausible.
According to polls, Mr. Romney is leading in South Carolina, and Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich could easily decide that a fight between them is meaningless if they let Mr. Romney run away with first place.
But it's just as easy to think that the two men might conclude that the only thing standing in the way of a serious challenge to Mr. Romney is the other one.
We'll know the answer in just a few minutes.
- 
8:08 P.M. | And Then There Were Five ...
A dwindling group of Republican presidential contenders - now just five - will debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., tonight as the party lurches closer toward choosing its nominee.
The departure of Jon M. Huntsman Jr. from the race on Monday morning helps clarify the political dynamics that should play out on the debate stage with just five days left before voters here go to the polls.
Each of the candidates will get more time to make his case. Even before Mr. Huntsman dropped out, Fox News, the sponsor of the debate, announced that it would allow 90 seconds for answers rather than a minute.
But the smaller field of candidates and the desire by Mitt. Romney's rivals to stop his march toward the nomination may sharpen the potential for personal attacks.

10:57 P.M. | Voters' Voices: Gun Rights an Important Issue 
The gun issue caught the King family's attention.
Gov. Mitt Romney said he would create no new restrictions on gun ownership. The family agreed with his answer, but found it inauthentic.
"A gun owner position would be I have an AR-15 and I'll shoot any soldier coming down the street trying to take it from me," he said. "That's what real gun owner's answer would be."
Shawna Whitaker, a family friend, said gun laws don't work.
"Law abiding citizens aren't the problem," she said. "Citizens who don't obey the law are going to get their hands on a gun anyway."
- 
10:56 P.M. | Gingrich and Romney Exchange Blows on Super PACs
There eventually had to be a clash between Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich over the super PACs that back them.
Mr. Gingrich was the first to claim indignation, saying that he wanted Mr. Romney to "exercise leadership" in getting the group to stop the negative ads against him.
The fact that the pro-Romney super PAC has not stopped, Mr. Gingrich said, "makes you wonder how much influence he would have if he were president."
It was a good line, but Mr. Romney had one of his own.
"You have a super PAC ad that attacks me," Mr. Romney said. "It's probably the biggest hoax since Bigfoot."
Mr. Romney insisted that both men have said the same thing - fix the ads or take them off of the air.
"For you to suggest that you and I have different standards here is just not right," Mr. Romney said.
- 
10:56 P.M. | Fact Check: Obama and Food Stamps
Newt Gingrich described President Obama as "the best food stamp president in American history'' and said the growth of food aid tended to "maximize dependency.''
"More people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history,'' Mr. Gingrich said Monday.
Agriculture Department statistics show that the number of food stamp recipients has increased 44 percent, to 46.2 million in October 2011, from 32 million in January 2009, when Mr. Obama took office.
The total cost of the program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, increased to $75.3 billion in the fiscal year 2011, from $53.6 billion in 2009 and $33 billion in the fiscal year 2007, before the recession began.
The growth partly reflects an increase in need, as millions of Americans have lost income and lost jobs or remain out of work. In addition, food prices have increased, eligibility has been expanded, and the 2009 economic stimulus law temporarily increased benefits.
Before Mr. Obama took office, food stamp participation was rising, in part because of federal policies that encouraged low-income people to seek aid for which they were eligible.
Nearly half of food stamp recipients are under age 18. Nearly 30 percent of food stamp households have earned income. Only 15 percent of such households have income above the poverty level ($18,500 for a family of three in 2011).
- 
10:53 P.M. | Fact Check: Gingrich on Balanced Budgets
While making the case for why his plan to privatize Social Security would not add to the national debt, Mr. Gingrich argued that he was responsible for four balanced federal budgets - and so could be trusted to be fiscally responsible. 
It is a claim Mr. Gingrich makes almost every day on the campaign trail, but it is based on an odd timeline. The years of balanced budgets in question are from fiscal 1998 through 2001, but Mr. Gingrich was in office for only the first two. He left the House in January 1999 and had no role in crafting the budgets for the subsequent two years. 
When pressed on this discrepancy, Mr. Gingrich sometimes argues that he deserves credit for policies enacted in the 1990s that promoted economic prosperity and established a climate for balancing budgets that carried beyond his time in office. 
This is at least the third time The Times has fact-checked this claim. PolitiFact has also looked into it repeatedly, most recently at the last Fox News debate in Iowa in December, when it was rated "false."
- 
10:51 P.M. | Fact Check: Obama and Military Spending
Mitt Romney was wrong in stating that Mr. Obama wants to cut $1 trillion from military spending. The administration is committed to reductions of less than half that amount over 10 years - about $450 billion, or roughly 8 percent of the Pentagon budget over a decade.
Moreover, Congressional Republicans as well as Democrats support the level of cuts that Mr. Obama seeks. The cuts were mandated as part of the bipartisan deficit-reduction agreement with Mr. Obama in August. That bipartisan deal does include another round of cuts in January 2013 that would be automatic, half in domestic programs and half in the military, and it would bring total military reductions to about $1 trillion over 10 years. But the administration opposes that outcome for the Pentagon. Mr. Obama's defense secretary, Leon Panetta, has said reductions on that scale would be ruinous. Mr. Obama has proposed alternative deficit-reduction measures to avoid the threatened automatic cuts, but Republicans oppose his plan because it calls for additional revenues from higher taxes on the wealthy as well as spending reductions in entitlement benefit programs like Medicare, farm subsidies and federal pension programs.
- 
10:43 P.M. | Romney Assesses His Biggest Threat
Whom does Mitt Romney fear more - Newt Gingrich or Rick Santorum? 
The last exchange may give a clue. 
When asked whether he wanted to jump into a debate over Social Security between the two men, Mr. Romney thought a moment and then said, "Rick is right."
He went on to agree with Mr. Santorum about the need for sacrifice and cuts to balance the budget. And then he agreed with a phrase that Mr. Santorum had just used to describe Mr. Gingrich's position: "fiscal insanity."
That kind of (temporary) alliance of sorts might suggest that Mr. Romney thinks he needs to worry about Mr. Gingrich.
- 
10:35 P.M. | Romney Chooses Words Carefully on Social Security
Clever wording alert: Mitt Romney said that to keep Social Security solvent, he would "add a year or two" to the retirement age for future recipients. 
His word choice stands out. Generally, presidential candidates speak, reluctantly, of "raising the retirement age" - a political bugaboo that has long upset American voters, who, perhaps unsurprisingly, do not want their retirement age to be a moving target. 
Mr. Romney seems to be testing out a new, gentler way of asking America's future retirees to work longer before collecting their full Social Security benefits.
- 
10:32 P.M. | Newt Gingrich, Historian
Mr. Gingrich is a historian again.
Asked about his plan to allow young people to invest their Social Security funds, he reached back to one of the many hats he has worn.
"As a historian, it's a fact-based model," Mr. Gingrich said. He talked a few minutes later about "the historic record in Chile" and said, "These are just historic facts."
Of course, the defense that Mr. Gingrich gave to having received more than $1 million working for Freddie Mac, the mortgage giant? 
He was a historian for that outfit.
- 
10:29 P.M. | Voters' Voices: Balancing Military Spending 
South Carolina has a strong military culture, but the King family is divided by Representative Ron Paul's statement that he would cut overseas military spending, but not eliminate defense jobs.
"We are wasting money on lots of things in military deployments," Mr. King said. But he wants to make sure that the United States has enough troops overseas to respond to any threats, especially from Iran.
Mary King, 17, said she would worry about cutting military spending if it meant eliminating jobs.
"So many people are employed by the U.S. military overseas," she said. "I don't think all of those should be taken away."
- 
10:28 P.M. | Audience Making Itself Heard
This has been one of the loudest audiences to attend the many debates that have been held during the Republican contest.
But the booing and applause may be deceiving in that they probably say little about how the state will vote on Saturday.
Still, it's good television, and could help cement the idea that one of the candidates has won the debate - at least in the eyes of those in the hall.
By that measure, the winner so far might be Newt Gingrich, who seems to have garnered the most applause from the audience.
- 
10:27 P.M. | Fact Check: Negotiating With the Taliban 
Mitt Romney says he would never negotiate an end to the war in Afghanistan with the Taliban. Instead, he argued, "we should kill the Taliban."
On this issue, he is at odds with not only the Obama administration, but also with many of his fellow Republicans. As Henry Kissinger, among others, have pointed out, you don't end wars negotiating with your friends. You end them negotiating with your enemies. It was a Republican president - Dwight D. Eisenhower - who negotiated a cease-fire in Korea in the early 1950s, and another Republican, Richard M. Nixon, who negotiated an exit from Vietnam. 
And it was the most recent Republican president, George W. Bush, whose administration took the position that the United States needed to defeat Al Qaeda but not the Taliban. The latter, argued Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, can be diminished, and forced to the bargaining table. But Mr. Romney would take a far harder-line position. What he did not say is how many troops it would take - and how many years it would take - to defeat the Taliban.
But in his critique that Mr. Obama weakened the American negotiating position by setting a date for American withdrawal, Mr. Romney is very much in the mainstream - many in the Pentagon agree with him. So do some Democratic strategists.
- 
10:24 P.M. | Voters' Voices: Impressed by Gingrich 
The King family thinks Newt Gingrich's comments about race were very effective. 
Mr. Gingrich has repeatedly called President Obama a "food stamp president." One of the debate moderators, Juan Williams, who is black, asked Mr. Gingrich whether his words were offensive to poor African-Americans.
"Juan is trying to milk the racial question," said Mike King, who is leaning toward supporting Mr. Gingrich. "He's trying to hype everyone up."
- 
10:23 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney on Tax Returns
Mr. Romney declined to commit to release his income tax returns when challenged twice, first by Mr. Gingrich and then by a debate questioner, but said he might do so in April. Last month, he said in an interview that he doubted that he would release the returns.
The nonpartisan fact-checking organization PolitiFact said in December that a Democratic National Committee claim that presidential candidates have traditionally released their income tax returns was "mostly true." The group reviewed the post-Watergate presidential races and found that of 34 presidential and vice-presidential candidates, seven declined to release their returns.
PolitiFact noted that Mr. Romney did not release his returns when he ran for governor and senator in Massachusetts and for president in 2008. It estimated his fortune at $190 million and $250 million, based on financial disclosure forms required of all presidential candidates by the Federal Election Commission.
- 
10:20 P.M. | Caucus Click: Uncle Sam in Attendance 
The question was familiar - virtually the same one that was famously asked of Democratic candidates for president in 2008: If there was actionable intelligence about Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, in Pakistan, would you go in?
Newt Gingrich took a while to get to the answer, but it was unmistakable.
"Andrew Jackson had a pretty clear idea about America's enemies," he said. "Kill them."
Mr. Romney had a pretty clear answer as well.
"We go anywhere they are, and we kill 'em," Mr. Romney said.
That, of course, was not Mr. Paul's answer. His answer prompted loud boos from the audience.
"Maybe we ought to consider a golden rule," Mr. Paul said. "Don't do to other nations what we don't want them to do to us."
- 
10:07 P.M. | Gingrich Shows His Debate Skills
Newt Gingrich is demonstrating again the kind of rhetorical flourishes that helped raise his campaign to the top during previous debates.
In an exchange with one moderator, Juan Williams, over how best to encourage employment among the poor, Mr. Gingrich skillfully got the audience on his side.
The audience booed Mr. Williams as Mr. Gingrich seized the mantle of the politically incorrect, declaring that he was merely trying to help poor people find jobs.
"They would be getting money," he declared. "Which is a good thing if you're poor. Only the elites despise making money."
That statement earned him a huge round of applause and showed how Mr. Gingrich might handle a similar exchange with Mr. Obama if he were to become the nominee.
The exchange also harked back to Mr. Gingrich's hands-off approach to his rivals before the negative campaigning of the last weeks before the Iowa caucuses. It was that approach - to avoid attacking rivals - that many people had said they admired in Mr. Gingrich.
- 
10:01 P.M. | Fact Check: Santorum on Education
Mr. Santorum's call earlier in the debate for the federal government to get out of elementary and secondary education was a crowd pleaser for an audience full of conservatives. He may have also had in mind Christian home schoolers in South Carolina. (Mr. Santorum and his wife home-schooled their children.) 
But the full ramifications of such a withdrawal are perhaps not fully appreciated. Historically, public education has been a responsibility of state and local governments, with the federal government imposing standards meant to raise the achievement of disadvantaged students and to ensure that students with disabilities receive an equal education. 
According to the Department of Education Web site, the federal government currently contributes 10.8 percent of the cost of elementary and secondary education. Much of the department's $68 billion budget supports classroom enrichment for poor students and aid for students with disabilities.
The federal money is both carrot and stick to compel school districts to enforce federal laws. All of the Republican candidates have called for a significant cutback in this formula, which has had bipartisan support since the 1960s. The candidates often say they would give the money as block grants to states and local districts, while repealing federal requirements. 
But many education experts, including in conservative research groups, doubt that many states would continue to uphold federal standards for poor and disabled students.
- 
10:00 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney on Obama's Job Plan
Mitt Romney said that while he already has a jobs plan even though he is not "yet" president, President Obama does not have a jobs plan. This is incorrect.
Mr. Obama sent legislation to Congress in early September that called for $447 billion in temporary tax cuts and spending initiatives that private-sector macroeconomic forecasters said would create up to 1.9 million additional jobs in 2012 and add up to two percentage points to the rate of economic growth. More than half of the package consists of tax cuts, including an extension and expansion of the current two-point cut in workers' 6.2 percent payroll tax for Social Security contributions, which would increase it to 3.1 percent for employees and provide relief to employers as well. 
Mr. Obama also called for financing for infrastructure projects to create jobs and subsidies to states to keep teachers and first responders in their jobs. Republicans have blocked much of the package because Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats proposed to offset the cost of the package with higher taxes on the wealthiest individuals. Congress and Mr. Obama agreed in December to a two-month extension of the current worker payroll tax relief and are negotiating on a full-year extension, but the partisan split over how to pay for the tax cut remains.
- 
9:57 P.M. | Fact Check: Paul on Overseas Bases
Representative Ron Paul's argument for closing American bases overseas goes to a critical question in American defense strategy: In the long run, is it more or less expensive to keep troops "forward deployed'?
It is not an easy question to answer, but it is also not as black and white as Mr. Paul made it sound. Some major allies, like Japan, pay to keep American troops on their soil. And in many cases, keeping troops abroad is considered a way to deter bad behavior - that is why the Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, is focused on keeping the Strait of Hormuz open, despite Iranian threats.
- 
9:56 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney's 120,000 Jobs
While defending his record as a corporate buyout specialist at Bain Capital, Mitt Romney said tonight that companies he had invested in while at Bain "ended up today having some 120,000 jobs." That number is slightly higher than the usual figure Mr. Romney cites on the campaign trail for job creation under Bain's supervision - 100,000 - and neither number tells the full story.
Mr. Romney arrives at the 100,000 jobs number by combining the current employment figures of three main companies that Bain Capital invested in - Staples, Sports Authority and Domino's Pizza. (He sometimes also includes a fourth company, Steel Dynamics). However, that number only addresses a small group of companies that Mr. Romney was successful in starting or turning around, and does not take into account the less successful companies that Bain Capital invested in, some of which went bankrupt or were forced to lay off workers. It is also worth noting that Bain Capital was not always a controlling investor in these companies.
Tonight, according to his campaign, Mr. Romney was specifically referring to four start-up companies - Staples, Sports Authority, Bright Horizons and Steel Dynamics. 
As Mr. Romney himself has said previously, not every company Bain Capital took over was successful, and some first cut jobs in order to grow. Mr. Romney's 100,000 figure (or, in the case of tonight's debate, the 120,000 figure) only takes into account his successful instances of job creation, and does not offset the number of jobs created by the number of jobs lost.
- 
9:51 P.M. | Romney's Tax Returns
It appears that the pressure to release his tax returns has finally gotten to Mitt Romney. 
Maybe.
Asked directly whether he would release his tax returns, Mr. Romney - who is said to be worth as much as $250 million - said that he was "happy to do so," but didn't quite commit.
"If that's been the tradition, I'm not opposed to doing that. Time will tell," he said, noting that he might be asked to do it in April. "I'll keep that open."
That's different from what he told reporters a few weeks ago, when he said he did not intend to release his tax returns.
"I doubt it," Mr. Romney said in December, according to a transcript of an interview provided by NBC News. "I will provide all the financial info, which is an extraordinary pile of documents which show investments and so forth."
"But you won't do the tax returns?" asked Chuck Todd, host of "The Daily Rundown."
"I don't intend to release the tax returns. I don't," Mr. Romney responded.
At the debate tonight, Mr. Romney seemed to have changed his mind, at least on the likelihood of whether he will eventually release them.
"If I become our nominee," he said of the question about releasing his returns, "that's probably what I'd do."
- 
9:48 P.M. | Paul on Cutting Defense Spending 
How can you tell this debate is taking place in South Carolina? 
How about a new line of argument from Ron Paul?
Mr. Paul, a famously antiwar Republican, has always railed against defense spending, saying that the country could save billions if not trillions by pulling back the military from the wars abroad.
Now, however, he's campaigning in a state with a very high proportion of military families and veterans. And so he's added a new bit to his argument.
"You still don't understand," Mr. Paul said to the moderators. "There's a difference between military spending and defense spending."
In a nutshell, Mr. Paul suggested that he could cut spending on the military - by pulling back from the wars - but increase spending on what he called "defense" at home.

9:45 P.M. | Romney Avoiding Confrontation 
If there was any question about whether Mitt Romney was going to mix it up with his rivals tonight, that has now been put to rest.
Mitt Romney appears determined to respond calmly, with a smile, to whatever is thrown at him - but not to get dragged into a confrontation that could spiral out of control or get under his skin.
Rick Santorum clearly tried to engage him a few minutes ago, with little success. Mr. Romney did not get emotional with Mr. Santorum or try to barrel over his answer.
Instead, Mr. Romney's approach seems to be designed to offer a few facts in rebuttal and quickly pivot to his message - a critique of President Obama and a statement of his own belief in capitalism and free enterprise.
Mr. Romney is at the top of the Republican field right now, and he clearly doesn't want to do anything to jeopardize that.
His rivals may try to pull him into more exchanges in an attempt to rattle him. But so far, Mr. Romney has not been very accommodating.

9:42 P.M. | Voters' Voices: No Love Lost for Huntsman
There's not a lot of love lost in our group for Jon M. Huntsman Jr., who dropped out of the race today.
"Who?" Mary King jokes.
"Can I be honest?" said her friend Kaleigh Smith. "I have never heard his name before."
This is a proud hometown crowd. The debate auditorium appears on the TV screen. 
"That's the Myrtle Beach Convention Center!" Mike King said. "That's where the gun show was."
The one thing our group can agree on: Representative Ron Paul of Texas is the odd man out on stage.
"This is a grumpy old man," said Shawna Whitaker, another friend of Ms. Smith's.
"He reminds me of Dumbledore," Ms. Smith said.
"He's funny," Mr. King said. "Isn't that like an old man to get funny on you?"
But the big question: Whom will you vote for on Saturday? Some in our group are leaning toward Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House. But Ms. Smith prefers Mitt Romney. 
"I just like him," she says as Mr. Romney appears on screen. "He seems confident."
But Ms. Whitaker thinks Mr. Romney seems like "a know-it-all." Being smart and good-looking isn't enough, she says. "Some people considered Bill Clinton charismatic and good-looking."
Mr. King, a Southern Baptist pastor, wants a candidate who speaks from the heart. "It seems like Romney is telling you what he thinks you want, not what he really believes," he said. "You can see when someone's giving you the party line or speaking from their soul."
- 
9:40 P.M. | Fact Check: 'Super PAC' Coordination 
When Mitt Romney was criticized tonight for attack ads that a "super PAC" supporting him has run against his opponents, he dismissed the suggestion that he could do anything about it.
"That's something that's completely out of the control of candidates," Mr. Romney protested.
In the narrowest sense, he's right. The ads that Restore Our Future - a super PAC supporting Mr. Romney's bid - have run against Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry and Rick Santorum would be plainly illegal if Mr. Romney had signed off on them. But Mr. Romney is suggesting a level of detachment from Restore Our Future that is at odds with reality.
Like super PACs supporting other candidates, Restore Our Future is run by three of Mr. Romney's former campaign aides and financed by his top donors. Mr. Romney and his campaign are barred by law from coordinating with them when it comes to expenditures in the presidential race. But the group and its work is effectively blessed by Mr. Romney, who appeared last summer at a meeting of potential donors.
Moreover, while Mr. Romney is not allowed to direct the group's activities, the law leaves plenty of running room for Mr. Romney to make his broader sentiments known. It would not violate the law, for example, for Mr. Romney to say publicly that he would prefer that any super PAC supporting him not wage any attacks on his opponents. Nor would it violate the law for Restore Our Future to heed Mr. Romney's wishes under that scenario. And the same goes for any of the super PACs backing other candidates, which have run ads critical of Mr. Romney, too.
- 
9:38 P.M. | Romney Finds an Answer for Question on Flip-Flops
The defense that Mr. Romney always reaches for when he is accused of changing his point of view? The time that he changed his view on abortion.
What was once seen as a significant problem for Mr. Romney - his flip-flop on a key social issue for conservatives - is now embraced by Mr. Romney as evidence of how a change can be heartfelt.
Will it work? Mr. Romney's campaign clearly believes in the explanation that he sincerely changed his mind. They think voters will accept it as well.
And it also has the benefit of responding to a tough question about multiple flip-flops on a series of issues with an answer about one single issue.
- 
9:36 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney's Record on Taxes
Mr. Gingrich declared that Mr. Romney "raised taxes" as governor of Massachusetts. Mr. Romney argues that he actually reduced taxes 19 times.
Mr. Romney is correct. So is Mr. Gingrich - sort of. Mr. Romney, who ran for governor on a pledge of no new taxes, closed about a dozen loopholes that allowed Massachusetts corporations to avoid paying various taxes. Corporations in the state viewed the moves as tax increases, as did Grover Norquist, the influential head of Americans for Tax Reform; Mr. Romney rejected that description, saying he was merely demanding that companies pay their fair share.
By the end of Mr. Romney's term, the loophole closings required companies to pay about $370 million a year in additional taxes, a nearly 20 percent increase from the period before he took office, according to an analysis of government data by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a nonprofit research group that receives financing from corporations.
The Romney administration also increased dozens of fees for Massachusetts residents and business (like the cost of a road test for a commercial driver's license, to $40 from $20).
As with the loophole closings, these were not taxes, per se, but close to it, critics said. But the distinction is crucial for Mr. Romney, who has long run on an antitax campaign message.
- 
9:33 P.M. | A Sharp Exchange Between Santorum and Romney
An exchange between Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum just now is a reflection of the tension that has built up between the two of them.
Mr. Santorum has grown increasingly angry over the last two days over an accusation about his support for a voting rights bill from a "super PAC" backing Mr. Romney.
Prodded by Mr. Santorum to say whether he supported giving voting rights to felons once they have completed their sentences, Mr. Romney said: "I don't think people who have committed violent crimes should be able to vote again. That's my view."
Mr. Santorum was clearly ready for that answer, noting that as governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Romney did nothing to change just such a law.
But the substance of the issue may be less significant than the exchange that it sparked, as Mr. Santorum sought repeatedly to directly engage Mr. Rommey.
He repeatedly directed questions about the ad at Mr. Romney, prodding him to take responsibility for the PAC's handiwork.
Mr. Romney rejected that argument, repeatedly saying that he has no control over what the super PACs do. But Mr. Santorum refused to accept that.
If such a group were saying something inaccurate, Mr. Santorum said, "I would go out and say: 'Stop it. You are representing me.' "
Look for more exchanges between the two men as the debate proceeds.
- 
9:20 P.M. | Gingrich on the Defensive
It's Mr. Gingrich on the defensive right at the start about his attacks on Mr. Romney.
A debate moderator, Bret Baier, decided to start the debate off by asking Mr. Gingrich whether his attacks on Mr. Romney's record at Bain Capital violate his own complaints about negative campaigning.
"If that's a part of your campaign, then questioning it has to be equally legitimate," Mr. Gingrich responded. "We need to satisfy the country that whoever we nominate has a record that can stand up to Barack Obama in a very effective way."
Mr. Gingrich has gone after Mr. Romney, as has a "super PAC" backing Mr. Gingrich's candidacy. Mr. Gingrich did not repeat his attacks, but defended raising the questions. 
"I have raised questions that I think are legitimate questions," Mr. Gingrich said. "The governor has every opportunity to answer those questions."
Mr. Romney responded calmly and coolly, arguing that during his tenure at Bain, jobs were added at some companies but lost at others.
"Free enterprise, with all of its different dimensions and players, makes the United States the strongest country in the world," Mr. Romney said a few minutes later.
"I know that people are going to come after me," Mr. Romney said. "But the record is pretty darn good."
- 
9:15 P.M. | Perry Prods Romney on Tax Returns
Rick Perry just put Mitt Romney on the spot, urging him to release his tax returns.
"Mitt, we need for you to release your income tax so the people of this country can see," Mr. Perry said.
Mr. Romney, a multimillionaire, has said he has no plans to release his tax returns. Mr. Perry said that's not good enough.
"Here's the real issue for us," Mr. Perry said. "We cannot fire our nominee in September. We need to know now."
Given the opportunity to respond, Mr. Romney ignored the request.

9:02 P.M. | Voters' Voices: Still Searching for a Candidate 
Our group is the King family. That's Michael King, 49, a Southern Baptist pastor; his wife, Lisa King, 48; and their daughter, Mary King, a high school student who turns 18 next month.
The Kings haven't decided which Republican presidential candidate to support. So they've invited some of Mary's friends over. Everyone is eating jalapeno-flavored Cheetos, chips and salsa, and gummy candy. We're watching Fox News and getting ready for the debate to start.
"We'll see how things go," Mr. King said. "All of the candidates have got their baggage."
- 
8:50 P.M. | Guide to Romney Debate Prep
Ever wonder about the debate prep that candidates undergo before one of these nationally televised forums? 
Aides to Mitt Romney insist that his prep sessions this time around are less formal - more like a conversation around a table with a handful of aides.
Eric Fehrnstrom, a top Romney adviser, sent this Twitter message today during an exchange with David Axelrod, one of President Obama's top political advisers: 
@davidaxelrod Haha! Believe it or not, the economy is an issue where we don't prep Mitt, he preps us.
And here's a bit from an article I wrote in October with my colleague Ashley Parker: 
When Mitt Romney crammed for the Republican presidential debates four years ago, he went all out: The campaign built a stage with four lecterns and used senior staff members as stand-ins for his rivals, John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani. A room packed with highly paid media consultants and senior officials barked suggestions as they flipped through a white binder filled with policy positions. Over time, one aide said, the binder grew to resemble the Manhattan White Pages.
This month, when Mr. Romney prepared for his seventh debate of the 2012 campaign, at Dartmouth College, there were no lecterns. No one playing Rick Perry or Herman Cain. And no overstuffed policy binders. Mr. Romney and a few aides simply sat around a small table at the Hanover Inn in New Hampshire and batted around topics in the news.
- 
8:43 P.M. | A Question to Ponder
Here's a question to ponder as the candidates prepare to take the stage in a few minutes .
Will Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum go after Mitt Romney tonight, or will they decide that they need to focus their rhetorical fire on each other?
Both scenarios are plausible.
According to polls, Mr. Romney is leading in South Carolina, and Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich could easily decide that a fight between them is meaningless if they let Mr. Romney run away with first place.
But it's just as easy to think that the two men might conclude that the only thing standing in the way of a serious challenge to Mr. Romney is the other one.
We'll know the answer in just a few minutes.
- 
8:08 P.M. | And Then There Were Five ...
A dwindling group of Republican presidential contenders - now just five - will debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., tonight as the party lurches closer toward choosing its nominee.
The departure of Jon M. Huntsman Jr. from the race on Monday morning helps clarify the political dynamics that should play out on the debate stage with just five days left before voters here go to the polls.
Each of the candidates will get more time to make his case. Even before Mr. Huntsman dropped out, Fox News, the sponsor of the debate, announced that it would allow 90 seconds for answers rather than a minute.
But the smaller field of candidates and the desire by Mitt. Romney's rivals to stop his march toward the nomination may sharpen the potential for personal attacks.

HIGHLIGHT: Times reporters take a closer look at some of the statements from the Republican presidential candidates during the debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C. 

 BODY:
 Obama and Food Stamps
Newt Gingrich described President Obama as "the best food stamp president in American history" and said the growth of food aid tended to "maximize dependency.''
"More people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history,'' Mr. Gingrich said Monday.
Agriculture Department statistics show that the number of food stamp recipients has increased 44 percent, to 46.2 million in October 2011, from 32 million in January 2009, when Mr. Obama took office.
The total cost of the program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, increased to $75.3 billion in fiscal year 2011, from $53.6 billion in fiscal year 2009 and $33 billion in fiscal year 2007, before the recession began.
The growth partly reflects an increase in need, as millions of Americans have lost income and lost jobs or remain out of work. In addition, food prices have increased, eligibility has been expanded, and the 2009 economic stimulus law temporarily increased benefits.
Before Mr. Obama took office, food stamp participation was rising, in part because of federal policies that encouraged low-income people to seek aid for which they were eligible.
Nearly half of food stamp recipients are under age 18. Nearly 30 percent of food stamp households have earned income. Only 15 percent of such households have income above the poverty level ($18,500 for a family of three in 2011).
-- 
 Gingrich and U.N. Program
Mr. Gingrich said Mitt Romney's "super PAC" had distorted his record on a bill he co-sponsored with Representative Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, with Mr. Romney saying that the bill would have given $60 million a year to a United Nations program supporting China's brutal one-child policy.
The bill actually attempted to address climate change, PolitiFact says, and a third of the House members were co-sponsors.
"The bill did propose money for the United Nations Population Fund, but it stated specifically that its funding could not be used for 'involuntary sterilization or abortion or to coerce any person to accept family planning,' " PolitiFact said.
-- 
 Gingrich on Balanced Budgets
While making the case for why his plan to privatize Social Security would not add to the national debt, Mr. Gingrich argued that he was responsible for four balanced federal budgets -- and so could be trusted to be fiscally responsible.
It is a claim Mr. Gingrich makes almost every day on the campaign trail, but it is based on an odd timeline. The years of balanced budgets in question are from fiscal 1998 through 2001, but Mr. Gingrich was in office for only the first two. He left the House in January 1999 and had no role in crafting the budgets for the subsequent two years.
When pressed on this discrepancy, Mr. Gingrich sometimes argues that he deserves credit for policies enacted in the 1990s that promoted economic prosperity and established a climate for balancing budgets that carried beyond his time in office.
This is at least the third time The Times has fact-checked this claim. PolitiFact has also looked into it repeatedly, most recently at the last Fox News debate in Iowa in December, when it was rated "false."
-- 
 Obama and Military Spending
Mr. Romney was wrong in stating that Mr. Obama wants to cut $1 trillion from military spending. The administration is committed to reductions of less than half that amount over 10 years -- about $450 billion, or roughly 8 percent of the Pentagon budget over a decade.
Moreover, Congressional Republicans as well as Democrats support the level of cuts that Mr. Obama seeks. The cuts were mandated as part of the bipartisan deficit-reduction agreement with Mr. Obama in August. That bipartisan deal does include another round of cuts in January 2013 that would be automatic, half in domestic programs and half in the military, and it would bring total military reductions to about $1 trillion over 10 years. But the administration opposes that outcome for the Pentagon. Mr. Obama's defense secretary, Leon Panetta, has said reductions on that scale would be ruinous. Mr. Obama has proposed alternative deficit-reduction measures to avoid the threatened automatic cuts, but Republicans oppose his plan because it calls for additional revenues from higher taxes on the wealthy as well as spending reductions in entitlement benefit programs like Medicare, farm subsidies and federal pension programs.
-- 
 Negotiating With the Taliban
Mr. Romney says he would never negotiate an end to the war in Afghanistan with the Taliban. Instead, he argued, "we should kill the Taliban.''
On this issue, he is at odds with not only the Obama administration, but also with many of his fellow Republicans. As Henry Kissinger, among others, have pointed out, you don't end wars negotiating with your friends. You end them negotiating with your enemies. It was a Republican president -- Dwight D. Eisenhower -- who negotiated a cease-fire in Korea in the early 1950s, and another Republican, Richard M. Nixon, who negotiated an exit from Vietnam.
And it was the most recent Republican president, George W. Bush, whose administration took the position that the United States needed to defeat Al Qaeda but not the Taliban. The latter, argued Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, can be diminished, and forced to the bargaining table. But Mr. Romney would take a far harder-line position. What he did not say is how many troops it would take -- and how many years it would take -- to defeat the Taliban.
But in his critique that Mr. Obama weakened the American negotiating position by setting a date for American withdrawal, Mr. Romney is very much in the mainstream -- many in the Pentagon agree with him. So do some Democratic strategists.
-- 
Gingrich on Private Retirement Accounts
 Mr. Gingrich called for major changes in Social Security, saying that younger workers should be allowed to put their share of the Social Security payroll tax into voluntary private accounts.
 "It makes every American an investor when they first go to work,'' Mr. Gingrich said of the proposal. "They all have a buildup of an estate, which you do not get in the current system.''
 Mr. Santorum and Mr. Romney ripped into the proposal, saying it could increase federal deficits and debt at a time when the government should be reducing them.
 Supporters of individual investment accounts say they would allow workers to earn a higher rate of return than they get from the Social Security trust fund. 
 Mr. Gingrich did not say exactly how he would pay the costs of making this change, which could be huge. Economists say that money diverted to private Social Security accounts would otherwise be available to pay benefits of current retirees, and that the government would need to find other ways to cover these costs.
 Mr. Santorum said he had favored private accounts for 15 years, but thought the idea would be "fiscal insanity'' at the moment. 
 If Mr. Gingrich is right in suggesting that 95 percent of younger workers would establish private accounts, Mr. Santorum said, "there'll be hundreds of billions of dollars in increased debts,'' and "we're going to be borrowing money from China to fund these accounts, which is wrong.''
 Mr. Romney said, "We simply can't say we're going to go out and borrow more and more money to let people set up new accounts that take money away from Social Security and Medicare today."
 One way to offset the cost, Mr. Gingrich said, is to consolidate "185 different federal bureaucracies that deal with low-income Americans.'' Mr. Gingrich said the government could slash overhead costs by consolidating these programs into a single block grant and sending it to the states.
-- 
 Romney on Tax Returns
Mr. Romney declined to commit to release his income tax returns when challenged twice, first by Mr. Gingrich and then by a debate questioner, but said he might do so in April. Last month, he said in an interview that he doubted that he would release the returns.
The nonpartisan fact-checking organization PolitiFact said in December that a Democratic National Committee claim that presidential candidates have traditionally released their income tax returns was "mostly true." The group reviewed the post-Watergate presidential races and found that of 34 presidential and vice-presidential candidates, seven declined to release their returns.
PolitiFact noted that Mr. Romney did not release his returns when he ran for governor and senator in Massachusetts and for president in 2008. It estimated his fortune at $190 million and $250 million, based on financial disclosure forms required of all presidential candidates by the Federal Election Commission.
-- 
 Obama and International Trade 
Reprising a charge he leveled against President Obama in New Hampshire, Mr. Romney suggested tonight that Mr. Obama had done nothing to advance trade with other countries.
"This president has opened up no new markets for American goods around the world in his three years, even as European nations and China have opened up 44," Mr. Romney charged.
Not true: Mr. Obama has signed three trade deals since taking office, one each with South Korea, Panama and Colombia. The South Korean deal was characterized by Bloomberg News as the largest trade deal since the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994.
Pushed by the Web site PolitiFact on the discrepancy, aides to Mr. Romney said the criticism was accurate because the deals originated in negotiations under the Bush administration, before Mr. Obama took office.
But the fact remains that all three were signed by Mr. Obama in October 2011. Indeed, PolitiFact noted that all three agreements faced significant resistance from the president's own party, but ultimately passed after extensive negotiations between Mr. Obama and Congress.
-- 
 Santorum on Education
Rick Santorum's call earlier in the debate for the federal government to get out of elementary and secondary education was a crowd pleaser for an audience full of conservatives. He may have also had in mind Christian home schoolers in South Carolina. (Mr. Santorum and his wife home-schooled their children.)
But the full ramifications of such a withdrawal are perhaps not fully appreciated. Historically, public education has been a responsibility of state and local governments, with the federal government imposing standards meant to raise the achievement of disadvantaged students and to ensure that students with disabilities receive an equal education.
According to the Department of Education Web site, the federal government currently contributes 10.8 percent of the cost of elementary and secondary education. Much of the department's $68 billion budget supports classroom enrichment for poor students and aid for students with disabilities.
The federal money is both carrot and stick to compel school districts to enforce federal laws. All of the Republican candidates have called for a significant cutback in this formula, which has had bipartisan support since the 1960s. The candidates often say they would give the money as block grants to states and local districts, while repealing federal requirements.
But many education experts, including in conservative research groups, doubt that many states would continue to uphold federal standards for poor and disabled students.
-- 
 Romney on Obama's Job Plan
Mr. Romney said that while he already has a jobs plan even though he is not "yet" president, President Obama does not have a jobs plan. This is incorrect.
Mr. Obama sent legislation to Congress in early September that called for $447 billion in temporary tax cuts and spending initiatives that private-sector macroeconomic forecasters said would create up to 1.9 million additional jobs in 2012 and add up to two percentage points to the rate of economic growth. More than half of the package consists of tax cuts, including an extension and expansion of the current two-point cut in workers' 6.2 percent payroll tax for Social Security contributions, which would increase it to 3.1 percent for employees and provide relief to employers as well.
Mr. Obama also called for financing for infrastructure projects to create jobs and subsidies to states to keep teachers and first responders in their jobs. Republicans have blocked much of the package because Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats proposed to offset the cost of the package with higher taxes on the wealthiest individuals. Congress and Mr. Obama agreed in December to a two-month extension of the current worker payroll tax relief and are negotiating on a full-year extension, but the partisan split over how to pay for the tax cut remains.
-- 
 Paul on Overseas Bases
Representative Ron Paul's argument for closing American bases overseas goes to a critical question in American defense strategy: In the long run, is it more or less expensive to keep troops "forward deployed'?
It is not an easy question to answer, but it is also not as black and white as Mr. Paul made it sound. Some major allies, like Japan, pay to keep American troops on their soil. And in many cases, keeping troops abroad is considered a way to deter bad behavior -- that is why the Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, is focused on keeping the Strait of Hormuz open, despite Iranian threats.
-- 
 Romney's 120,000 Jobs
While defending his record as a corporate buyout specialist at Bain Capital, Mr. Romney said tonight that companies he had invested in while at Bain "ended up today having some 120,000 jobs." That number is slightly higher than the usual figure Mr. Romney cites on the campaign trail for job creation under Bain's supervision -- 100,000 -- and neither number tells the full story.
Mr. Romney arrives at the 100,000 jobs number by combining the current employment figures of three main companies that Bain Capital invested in - Staples, Sports Authority and Domino's Pizza. (He sometimes also includes a fourth company, Steel Dynamics). However, that number only addresses a small group of companies that Mr. Romney was successful in starting or turning around, and does not take into account the less successful companies that Bain Capital invested in, some of which went bankrupt or were forced to lay off workers. It is also worth noting that Bain Capital was not always a controlling investor in these companies.
Tonight, according to his campaign, Mr. Romney was specifically referring to four start-up companies -- Staples, Sports Authority, Bright Horizons and Steel Dynamics.
As Mr. Romney himself has said previously, not every company Bain Capital took over was successful, and some first cut jobs in order to grow. Mr. Romney's 100,000 figure (or, in the case of tonight's debate, the 120,000 figure) only takes into account his successful instances of job creation, and does not offset the number of jobs created by the number of jobs lost.
-- 
 'Super PAC' Coordination 
When Mr. Romney was criticized tonight for attack ads that a "super PAC" supporting him has run against his opponents, he dismissed the suggestion that he could do anything about it.
"That's something that's completely out of the control of candidates," Mr. Romney protested.
In the narrowest sense, he's right. The ads that Restore Our Future -- a super PAC supporting Mr. Romney's bid -- have run against Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry and Rick Santorum would be plainly illegal if Mr. Romney had signed off on them. But Mr. Romney is suggesting a level of detachment from Restore Our Future that is at odds with reality.
Like super PACs supporting other candidates, Restore Our Future is run by three of Mr. Romney's former campaign aides and financed by his top donors. Mr. Romney and his campaign are barred by law from coordinating with them when it comes to expenditures in the presidential race. But the group and its work is effectively blessed by Mr. Romney, who appeared last summer at a meeting of potential donors.
Moreover, while Mr. Romney is not allowed to direct the group's activities, the law leaves plenty of running room for Mr. Romney to make his broader sentiments known. It would not violate the law, for example, for Mr. Romney to say publicly that he would prefer that any super PAC supporting him not wage any attacks on his opponents. Nor would it violate the law for Restore Our Future to heed Mr. Romney's wishes under that scenario. And the same goes for any of the super PACs backing other candidates, which have run ads critical of Mr. Romney, too.

 Romney's Record on Taxes
Mr. Gingrich declared that Mr. Romney "raised taxes" as governor of Massachusetts. Mr. Romney argues that he actually reduced taxes 19 times.
Mr. Romney is correct. So is Mr. Gingrich - sort of. Mr. Romney, who ran for governor on a pledge of no new taxes, closed about a dozen loopholes that allowed Massachusetts corporations to avoid paying various taxes. Corporations in the state viewed the moves as tax increases, as did Grover Norquist, the influential head of Americans for Tax Reform; Mr. Romney rejected that description, saying he was merely demanding that companies pay their fair share.

HEADLINE: No Closure for Denver's Beltway Loop

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
GOLDEN, Colo. -- Breathes there a soul who really, truly, loves a beltway? Maybe, but you are not likely to find one here in this little city in the Rocky Mountain foothills west of Denver.
For decades, this has been the community that said no, arguing through courts and politics and whatever other means available that a multilane ring road circling Denver -- the kind built around cities all across America starting in the 1950s and '60s -- would spell disaster. Most of Denver's belt-loop would cruise through open prairie land; here it would cleave the narrow Golden Valley and shatter the community, residents and their leaders said in what became a mantra.
The holdout appears now to have won, or at least fought the mighty belt to a draw, leaving a gap here in the nearly 102-mile circle that most planners have all but given up on completing.
Federal and state money for new highways faded with the recession. Political will at the state Capitol to push a beltway, or punish Golden for intransigence, has evaporated too under a governor, John W. Hickenlooper, who preaches regional cooperation. Negotiations among Golden and its neighbors over a new public/private extension of the beltway north of the town broke off last month. 
''CDOT has other priorities,'' said Stacey Stegman, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Transportation, referring to the idea of completing the beltway.
But if Golden, one of Colorado's oldest cities and briefly the territorial capital in the mid 1800s, did beat the belt -- and some say its victory could come back to haunt it -- should metro Denver and its drivers offer thanks, or curses? Is Golden a David with a sling, bringing down a giant, or a selfish obstructionist?
Transportation and planning experts say there is probably no clear answer as to whether beltways have been good or bad. If in some places they led to urban sprawl, they say, by opening up undeveloped land and decentralizing downtowns, there are also examples where a belt, by diverting traffic to the edges, kept a thoroughfare from passing straight through a city's center and ripping it apart.
Memphis, for example, embraced the ring road as a way of avoiding an Interstate through downtown. Portland residents, by contrast, opposed a proposed Interstate extension in the 1970s, and the plan was scrapped in favor of public transit. Robert Moses' dream of a superhighway loop across Lower Manhattan went the way of fins and leaded gas. South Pasadena's opposition to the 710 Freeway in Southern California created a break in the highway that persists to this day.
Denver, by dragging out the beltway fight for decades -- the vision was put down in regional plans in the late 1950s -- created a kind of third way: a belt constructed in stages amid a slow-motion fight that never ended. Just this month, Golden filed a federal lawsuit accusing the Fish and Wildlife Service of improperly allowing federal land for a proposed new section of belt north of the city.
''Denver, as a result of doing it piecemeal, may not have had the curse of pushing people out into the exurbs,'' said Representative Max Tyler, a Democrat who represents Golden in the state Legislature.
Some prominent urban planning experts are not so sure about that.
Because Denver's partial belt was built over time, with many assuming that the project would one day be finished, business owners and residents made decisions accordingly. Decentralization and sprawl, said one prominent planner, Patrick Phillips, have already happened. Golden's pushing the fight to the last man standing will not change what the region became along the way, he said.
''The cow has left the barn,'' said Mr. Phillips, the chief executive officer at the Urban Land Institute, a nonprofit research and education organization based in Washington. ''It is an incorrect argument that if you can hold out against that last segment and not complete the ring it will be a bulwark against sprawl, because the sprawl already exists. From a regional planning and transportation perspective it makes more sense to have a full beltway than three-fourths of a beltway.''
Historians say the belt idea itself was essentially a kind of arranged marriage between urban America and the Interstate highway system, which began paving its way across the nation late in the Eisenhower administration.
The question, which had never before existed in a country of local and often unpaved roads, was what should happen when the Interstate encountered a city. Through the decades since, of richer and poorer and bumper-to-bumper, the answer -- a circle -- shaped what scores of cities became.
''It was like they took a magic marker and drew a circle on the map,'' said Brian D. Taylor, a professor of urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles, and co-author of a forthcoming book on metropolitan freeway systems. ''What was designed to link cities, in fact, became the backbone of the transportation system in most U.S. cities.''
But Denver's debate swerved again to its own idiosyncratic place beyond the logistics of engineering.
In the mid-1970s, when the environmental movement was gathering steam, Gov. Dick Lamm removed the one section of Denver's beltway that had been identified as an Interstate from the federal system, which in effect took federal authorities out of the picture for the whole distance.
That changed everything -- making the belt's future more locally controlled, and more dependent on private financing and tolls, said Steven D. Rudy, the transportation director at the Denver Regional Council of Governments, a planning organization. And with many local governments in the region involved in deciding where the belt should go and how to pay for it, the result was probably more democratic, too, he said, however messy the process became.
''It was about the Denver region deciding it was something it wanted done and doing it itself,'' Mr. Rudy said.
Even some people here in Golden fear the city's victory could be Pyrrhic. If the extension north of town, called the Jefferson Parkway, is built and the belt thus closes in on both edges -- a section already exists just to the south -- then local streets, the critics say, could be overwhelmed by drivers creating a de facto belt by driving through Golden to get to the section of belt on the other side.
Golden city officials said that projected traffic numbers on the parkway extension have been inflated to make the project appear more financially viable.
''According to our studies, it would not make that much difference to traffic,'' said Golden's mayor, Marjorie Sloan.
Bill Ray, a senior policy adviser to the Jefferson Parkway Public Highway Authority, said the future would change with or without Golden's consent. A growing population, he said, would bring congestion to the little Golden Valley, and the only question was how the resulting traffic would be managed.
''There's a false dichotomy to say that (a) the parkway is built and bad things happen to Golden, or (b) it's never built and the future is good,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Euro Woes Could Revive Bout of Market Volatility

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; David Jolly and Peter Eavis contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Investors are bracing for a return to volatility when markets in the United States reopen on Tuesday as renewed gloom about the debt crisis in Europe threatens to end the calm that has prevailed on Wall Street in recent weeks.
''We've had a lull, but I expect the pressure to start growing again with a renewed round of financial market agitation,'' said Charles Wyplosz, a professor of international economics at the Graduate Institute of Geneva. ''There will be a renewed sense of emergency, which doesn't make for clearer thinking.'' 
Late last week, Standard & Poor's cut its ratings on shaky borrowers like Italy and Spain and stripped France of its once-sterling AAA debt rating. On Monday, it followed up with another downgrade, this time on a bailout fund aimed at shoring up weaker members of the euro zone. The rating on the European Financial Stability Facility was lowered to AA+ from AAA, and S.& P. warned that more cuts could come if Europe failed to address its worsening fiscal situation.
Klaus Regling, chief executive of the facility, said the downgrade of the fund by a single agency would not reduce its lending capacity of 440 billion euros ($556 billion). The fund ''has sufficient means to fulfill its commitments'' until a permanent fund, the European Stability Mechanism, starts operating in July, he said.
Anxiety is also building over the fate of the country hardest hit by the European debt crisis, Greece. Representatives of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund resume negotiations with the Greek government Wednesday over the next step in a planned 130 billion euro bailout, even as they try to force hedge funds and other private holders of Greek bonds to accept large losses to make the country's debt burden more manageable.
If Athens cannot secure concessions from the bondholders or the bailout money it needs from the so-called troika in the coming weeks, Greece could default by March 20, when 14.5 billion euros in debt comes due and must be repaid. The specter of a disorderly default, rather than the voluntary losses now being negotiated, unnerved stock markets around the world last fall and could prompt renewed selling now.
The next several weeks bring what are shaping up to be a series of turning points on both sides of the Atlantic. Even as the negotiations in Greece proceed, several debt sales by other European borrowers this week should provide clues to how seriously investors are taking the recent warnings by S.& P. and other ratings agencies.
Highlighting the political stakes, European leaders are set to gather for a summit meeting in Brussels on Jan. 30. Investors had hoped for more clarity on Greece's fate before they gathered, but that is looking much less likely, said Julian Callow, chief European economist at Barclays. What is more, Italy has 26 billion euros in debt coming due on Feb. 1, putting additional pressure on European leaders to reassure nervous markets.
In the first test of investors' appetite for debt since the broader downgrade, France sold 8.6 billion euros ($10.9 billion) of short-term debt securities on Monday at yields slightly lower than in the previous auction. The yields on the country's 10-year bonds had fallen 0.04 percentage point by late afternoon, to 3.011 percent.
The stability facility is set to auction bills Tuesday, while Spain and Portugal have debt sales later in the week, all of which will be closely watched by investors, said Ron Florance, the managing director for investment strategy at Wells Fargo Private Bank. ''Everyone is just kind of holding their breath to see how these auctions go,'' Mr. Florance said. ''Investors are just going to have to be able to ride through the volatility; it's going to be bumpy.''
Since late November, Wall Street has taken a more optimistic turn, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising by more than 1,000 points, to close at 12,422.06 on Friday. Signs of improvement in the job market have led some observers to conclude that what had been a very anemic recovery in the United States might be finally gathering some steam.
But if the European banking system seizes up and economies in the region go into a steep recession, the chances that United States can insulate itself are slim, analysts said. ''It seems pretty clear to me that once Europe reaches a tipping point, nowhere else in the world can decouple,'' said Benjamin Bowler, global head of equity derivatives research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
In addition to the news from Europe, American markets will also be affected by earnings news as large companies report their fourth-quarter results, including several financial companies over the next few days. Citigroup and Wells Fargo will announce earnings on Tuesday, with Goldman Sachs reporting on Wednesday and Bank of America on Thursday. Slow capital markets activity is expected to weaken profits across the board, but analysts will be looking for clues about the health of consumer spending and corporate borrowing in the latest results.

HEADLINE: Climate Proposal Puts Practicality Ahead of Sacrifice

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
The current issue of the journal Science contains a proposal to slow global warming that is extraordinary for a couple of reasons:
1. In theory, it would help people living in poor countries now, instead of mainly benefiting their descendants.
2. In practice, it might actually work.
This proposal comes from an international team of researchers -- in climate modeling, atmospheric chemistry, economics, agriculture and public health -- who started off with a question that borders on heresy in some green circles: Could something be done about global warming besides forcing everyone around the world to use less fossil fuel?
Ever since the Kyoto Protocol imposed restrictions in industrial countries, the first priority of environmentalists has been to further limit the emission of carbon dioxide. Burning fewer fossil fuels is the most obvious way to counteract the greenhouse effect, and the notion has always had a wonderfully virtuous political appeal -- as long as it's being done by someone else.
But as soon as people are asked to do it themselves, they follow a principle identified by Roger Pielke Jr. in his book ''The Climate Fix.'' Dr. Pielke, a political scientist at the University of Colorado, calls it iron law of climate policy: When there's a conflict between policies promoting economic growth and policies restricting carbon dioxide, economic growth wins every time. 
The law holds even in the most ecologically correct countries of Europe, as Dr. Pielke found by looking at carbon reductions from 1990 until 2010.
The Kyoto Protocol was supposed to put Europe on a new energy path, but it contained so many loopholes that the rate of ''decarbonization'' in Europe did not improve in the years after 1998, when the protocol was signed, or after 2002, when it was ratified. In fact, Europe's economy became more carbon-intensive in 2010, he says -- a trend that seems likely to continue as nuclear power plants are shut down in Germany and replaced by coal-burning ones.
''People will make trade-offs, but the one thing that won't be traded off is keeping the lights on at reasonable cost,'' he says. Given the reluctance of affluent Europeans to make sacrifices, what are the odds of persuading billions of people in poorer countries to pay more for energy today in return for a cooler climate at the end of the century?
But suppose they were offered a deal with immediate benefits, like the one proposed in Science by researchers in the United States, Britain, Italy, Austria, Thailand and Kenya. The team looked at ways to slow global warming while also reducing the soot and smog that are damaging agriculture and health.
Black carbon, the technical term for the soot spewed from diesel engines and traditional cookstoves and kilns, has been blamed for a significant portion of the recent warming in the Arctic and for shrinking glaciers in the Himalayas. Snow ordinarily reflects the sun's rays, but when the white landscape is covered with soot, the darker surface absorbs heat instead.
Methane, which is released from farms, landfills, coal mines and petroleum operations, contributes to ground-level ozone associated with smog and poorer yields from crops. It's also a greenhouse gas that, pound for pound, is far more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping the sun's heat.
After looking at hundreds of ways to control these pollutants, the researchers determined the 14 most effective measures for reducing climate change, like encouraging a switch to cleaner diesel engines and cookstoves, building more efficient kilns and coke ovens, capturing methane at landfills and oil wells, and reducing methane emissions from rice paddies by draining them more often.
If these strategies became widespread, the researchers calculate, the amount of global warming in 2050 would be reduced by about one degree Fahrenheit, roughly a third of the warming projected if nothing is done. This impact on temperatures in 2050 would be significantly larger than the projected impact of the commonly proposed measures for reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Not incidentally, the researchers calculate, these reductions in low-level ozone and black carbon would yield lots of benefits long before 2050. Because people would be breathing cleaner air, 700,000 to 4.7 million premature deaths would be avoided each year. Thanks to improved crop yields, farmers would produce at least 30 million more metric tons of food annually.
''The beauty of these pollution-control measures is that over five to 10 years they pay for themselves in the developing world,'' says Drew Shindell, the lead author of the proposal, who is a climate scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and at Columbia University. ''They slow global warming, but there are local benefits, too. If you make black carbon reductions in China or India, you get most of the benefits in China or India.''
These ideas already have a few fans, including Ted Nordhaus, a founder of the Breakthrough Institute, which has endorsed similar measures in a report called ''Climate Pragmatism.'' Mr. Nordhaus sees the Science paper as a model for the future.
''This is what the post-Kyoto world will look like,'' he says. ''We'll increasingly be managing ecological problems like global warming, not solving them. We may make some headway in limiting our emissions, but if we do so it will be through innovating better energy technologies and implementing them at the national and regional level, not through top-down international limits.''
These pollution-control policies aren't especially controversial -- even Republicans hostile to environmentalists have supported research into black carbon -- but neither have they have been especially popular. Mainstream environmental groups haven't put them on the agenda. One reason is the lack of glamour: Encouraging villagers to use diesel engine filters and drain their rice paddies is less newsworthy than negotiating a global treaty on carbon at a United Nations conference.
Another reason is the fear of distracting people from the campaign against carbon dioxide, the gas with the most long-term impact. Because it lingers in the atmosphere much longer than soot or methane, some scientists argue that limiting it must be the first step. Dr. Shindell says he agrees with the need to limit carbon dioxide and sympathizes with those who worry about losing focus.
''But I also worry that carbon dioxide will go up even if we do focus on it,'' he says. ''We're at a complete deadlock on carbon dioxide. Dealing with the short-lived pollutants might really be a way to bridge some of the differences, both between the two sides in the United States and between the developed and the developing world.''
No matter what people think about global warming, there aren't a lot of fans of dirty snow, poor crops and diseased lungs.

HEADLINE: Thwarted Travelers

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
Travel groups and convention planners are among the groups pressing the United States to change some of its more onerous visa requirements, arguing that the current rules are keeping out many international business travelers and that a faster, more efficient process would help American companies compete in the global marketplace.
The waiting time to obtain a visa in some countries can be up to 100 days, according to the trade group U.S. Travel Association, and travelers who do not live in or near a city where an American consulate is located may have to spend hundreds of dollars in travel expenses for mandatory face-to-face interviews. 
''There is nothing, absolutely nothing, about a 100-day wait time to make us any more secure,'' Geoff Freeman, chief operating officer of the association. ''That is costing our economy dearly.''
Global long-haul travel grew by 40 percent from 2000 to 2010, the association said, but the United States' share fell to 12.4 percent from 17 percent. The association calculated that by failing to keep pace, the United States lost 78 million potential visitors who would have generated $606 billion in spending.
The association is pushing for legislation that would reduce waiting time for visas by adding personnel and reassigning consular officers to high-demand markets, waiving the in-person interview for applicants who are renewing visas, introducing a pilot videoconferencing program to conduct interviews and expanding the visa waiver program.
In recent months, members of both the Senate and the House have introduced eight bills to stimulate travel to the United States.
In an interview, Deputy Secretary of State Thomas R. Nides said the correlation between visa issuance and spending is undisputed. ''We're very much focused on an ongoing dialogue'' that would facilitate legitimate travel and job growth, he said. ''But it is a balancing act.'' Every decision ''has to be made in light of national security,'' he added.
But despite increased demand -- visa processing jumped 48 percent in China and 63 percent in Brazil in the last three months of 2011 compared with the period a year earlier -- the waiting time for visa interviews has decreased. In the meantime, other countries are aggressively courting travelers from countries not part of the waiver program. In July, Canada introduced 10-year multiple entry visas for all countries that require a visa, including Brazil and China, and in August announced the opening of three new visa application centers in Brazil, according to the Tourism Industry Association of Canada, a trade group. ''Previous policies were based on our views of the 20th century world and need to evolve,'' said David F. Goldstein, president and chief executive.
Shane Downey, director of public policy for the Global Business Travel Association, said a speech at the group's recent annual convention in Denver that included discussion of visa reform touched a nerve. ''We immediately started receiving e-mails'' about members' frustrations, he said.
Steven Hacker, president of the International Association of Exhibitions and Events, said: ''When international buyers and sellers try to come and can't, they go to other countries,'' he said. ''Ten years ago emerging countries like China, Brazil and India were not nearly as sophisticated as they are today, so there wasn't much demand.''
He told of a recent exhibition of the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, an event for the construction industry held every three years, when the visa application for one person in a large group was rejected at the last minute, so the whole group was unable to attend.
Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Association, said his organization also loses many visitors at its annual show from markets like China. ''I believe the U.S. consulates and embassy in China have been responsive but are understaffed and under-resourced,'' he said. ''Still, we hear of many visa denials for unknown reasons.''
Christopher Nassetta, president of Hilton Worldwide, had a similar story about the company's global conference in 2010 in Orlando, Fla., for thousands of owners from around the world representing the 10 Hilton Worldwide brands. ''But we had some cases where we could not get owners into the country,'' he said. ''You can't throw the baby out with the bath water,'' he said, referring to security after the Sept. 11 attacks. ''We need jobs. We need economic growth.''
Compromising security is a major concern, said Bruce McIndoe, president of iJET Intelligent Risk Systems, a travel risk management company. ''There is always some trade-off. But processes can be put into place to minimize any security risk.''
A bigger issue may be that people from nonwaiver countries will overstay their visa and remain in the United States, he said. Videoconferencing ''would be a good service and help facilitate the process,'' he added, but document verification, background investigations to ensure that visitors return home, and database checks to identify people with legal problems or known terrorists will still be the most critical measures.
Despite the steps to streamline things, which include sharply increased staff in high-demand areas and drastically increased capacity by providing more windows at offices and extending hours of operation, Mr. Nides said challenges remain. For example, hiring and training consular officers with the proper language abilities and skills to ensure that the ''right people, for the right reasons'' are issued visas is a sophisticated process that takes time. And the department does not support videoconferencing for security and efficiency reasons.
''But the reality is, as of today, we are at or above pre-9/11 levels,'' Mr. Nides said. ''We're continually trying to figure out where the efficient models are. One of the things that is very clear to me is that every visa decision is a national security decision, which is why we take it so seriously. We will set ourselves back if we get it wrong.''

HEADLINE: Despite Long Slide by Kodak, Company Town Avoids Decay

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
ROCHESTER -- In what was once the ultimate company town, virtually everyone has a trove of bright Kodak moments.
They were plucked from the personal memories immortalized on the film made here, the bountiful jobs that allowed children to follow their parents into Kodak's secure embrace, the seemingly endless largess that once allowed the company's founder, George Eastman, to provide dental care at little or no cost to every child in town.
Now, with Eastman Kodak's stock price below $1 and talk of bankruptcy inescapable, people here are pondering a thought as unimaginable as New Orleans without the French Quarter or New York without the Yankees -- Rochester after the calamitous fall of the company Eastman founded in 1880.
It feels like the wrenching culmination of a slide over decades, during which Kodak's employment in Rochester plummeted from 62,000 in the 1980s to less than 7,000 now. Still, for this city in western New York, the picture that emerges, like a predigital photograph coming to life in a darkroom, is not a simple tale of Rust Belt decay. 
Rochester has been a job-growth leader in the state in recent years. In 1980, total employment in the Rochester metropolitan area was 414,400. In 2010, it was 503,200. New businesses have been seeded by Kodak's skilled work force, a reminder that a corporation's fall can leave behind not just scars but also things to build upon.
''The decline of Kodak is extremely painful,'' said Joel Seligman, president of the University of Rochester, which, with its two hospitals, is the city's largest employer with 20,000 jobs. ''But if you step back and look at the last two or three decades, you see the emergence of a much more diversified, much more knowledge-based economy.''
Kodak announced last week its most recent reorganization, an effort to cut costs and enhance digital operations, which now account for 80 percent of revenue. But after the company said in November that it could run out of cash in a year if it could not sell more than 1,000 digital-imaging patents, fears of bankruptcy have emerged among investors, retirees and employees.
A Kodak spokesman, Christopher Veronda, said the company did not comment on market rumors. In an e-mail, he added, ''Rochester has been our home for more than 130 years, and it remains our home.''
Still, nowhere have Kodak's troubles resonated more than in Rochester, where George Eastman's philanthropy and legacy live on in myriad institutions, including the University of Rochester and its Eastman School of Music. The George Eastman House museum of photography and motion pictures still has the oak box he used to keep up with his donations, whether it was the $625,000 he gave in 1901 to the Mechanics Institute, now the Rochester Institute of Technology, or his smaller gifts to groups like the Vacant Lot Gardening Association or the Rochester Association of Workers for the Blind. The company's charitable contributions continued long after his death in 1932, and local officials say its generous buyout and severance packages have cushioned the blow of its decline.
Kodak's fall carries an emotional punch, too, like seeing an enduring part of the American experience wither away.
James Ulrich, who volunteers as a docent at the Eastman House, thinks back with pride on the greatest summer job ever, traveling the country in a Kodak company car taking pictures of tourists taking pictures.
Robert Shanebrook, who until his retirement in 2003 spent most of his 35 years at Kodak working with world-class photographers like Ansel Adams and Yousuf Karsh, said: ''We all had this personal investment and personal pride in being part of this organization; we felt we were working with the most capable people in the world. And then it all sort of crumbled, like finding out something bad about someone you were close to.
''You think, 'How could that be?' ''
The images of prosperity are being replaced by ones in shadows and shades of gray -- the largely empty parking lots at the Kodak headquarters and its sprawling manufacturing complex, or seeing the ''Kodak'' sign blazing across the night sky downtown and wondering if before long the lights will go dark.
Rochester's troubles go beyond Kodak. Xerox and Bausch & Lomb have shed thousands of jobs as well. Twenty-five years ago, the three companies employed 60 percent of Rochester's work force. Today, it is 6 percent.
''Part of my job is convincing people we aren't the place we once were,'' Mayor Thomas S. Richards said.
The most painful toll is in the city itself, where the population has dropped to 210,000 from a peak of 332,000 in 1950, and where vast stretches north of downtown are dreary acres of decay. And while job growth has been strong, wages have declined from well above the national average at Kodak's peak to below it now, reflecting the dwindling of well-paying factory jobs.
But beyond the urban core, in sparkling new office parks and research labs, at the University of Rochester and the Rochester Institute of Technology and the local medical complexes, Rochester remains quite robust, in no small part because of the legacy Kodak and other faded industrial giants left behind.
The fact that Kodak declined over decades, rather than suffering a sudden collapse, allowed people at the company and elsewhere to explore new options -- to take skills in medical technology, photonics, imaging or optics to small startups or to start their own.
Steve Kristy spent 18 years at Kodak until finally quitting in 2000, saying he was exasperated by the company's inability to embrace the digital world. Mr. Kristy is now chief executive of a company he co-founded, LiquidPixels, which provides enhanced visuals for Web sites, making use of skills he learned at Kodak.
''Kodak was frustrating and rewarding to work for,'' he said. ''It's had such a wonderful brand that it's sad it couldn't stretch that into the digital era, but it produced an amazing wealth of people who want to stay in Rochester and are available to work in all areas of technology.''
Similarly, Kodak left behind an industrial infrastructure that may never be duplicated, 1,200 acres that once employed more than 30,000 people and that are being repurposed as Eastman Business Park, where half the 6,200 employees still work for Kodak and half work for 35 other companies located on the site.
Many of those companies were spun off from Kodak, like Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, which is now part of Johnson & Johnson and produces blood analyzers for medical offices and hospitals; Carestream Health, which manufactures conventional and digital X-ray equipment; and ITT, which manufactures optics for military and government applications.
Michael Alt, director of the park, said the facility had enormous potential despite Kodak's struggles.
''Maybe when the quicksand gets up to your neck you ought to be reaching for the rope, but it's not there yet,'' he said.
Local officials expect that if Kodak goes into bankruptcy, it will continue to operate, which would very likely mean a smaller company and financial repercussions for many retirees. But no one expects Kodak to play as large a role as it once did or for any single company to take up the slack.
''Sure there's nostalgia, and when you have this kind of news it tends to amplify it, but we cannot plan our future on the basis of nostalgia,'' Mayor Richards said. ''We will fail here if what we try to do is replicate what we had 30 years ago.''

HEADLINE: Bomb-Making Chemicals Are Seized by Thai Police

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER; Poypiti Amatatham contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BANGKOK -- Thai police units on Monday seized what they said was a large stash of two chemicals that could be used to make rudimentary bombs, as a murky case that put the country on alert for a terrorist attack took a confusing turn.
A top Bangkok police official said the chemicals, ammonium nitrate and urea, were found in a commercial building on the outskirts of Bangkok. They were meant to be shipped out of the country, the official said, allaying fears of a pending attack on Thai soil. 
The Thai prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, said: ''The situation is under control -- no problem. And I can guarantee the safety of our citizens and foreign tourists.''
But the United States Embassy said it stood by its emergency message issued Friday, saying terrorists might be planning attacks against ''tourist areas in Bangkok in the near future.''
The case appears to center on a Lebanese man, identified as Atris Hussein, who was arrested at Bangkok's main airport on Thursday evening as he tried to leave the country. The Thai authorities said his arrest came after a tip from Israeli intelligence agents, who warned that a group of people who appeared to be from Hezbollah were planning to strike tourist sites in Bangkok in mid-January.
Thai officials said Mr. Hussein was himself a member of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group based in Lebanon that the United States and Israel consider a terrorist organization. Hezbollah denied that he was a member.
Thailand now fears the effect on the country's tourism, a pillar of the economy. The Israeli government has advised its citizens visiting Thailand not to congregate in public, and the United States Embassy issued the emergency message. The Thai authorities increased security over the weekend at Khao San Road, a center for backpackers in the capital, and at other places popular with foreigners.
On Monday, Mr. Hussein, clad in a protective vest and a face mask, led the police units to a three-story building he had been renting for a year in Samut Sakhon Province, near Bangkok, where they found the chemicals, both of which can be used as fertilizers. The urea was stored in bags labeled as cat litter.
The chief of the Bangkok Metropolitan Police, Winai Thongsong, said in an interview that Mr. Hussein had contacted a shipping company in Thailand to send the material out of the country in container units. Mr. Winai declined to specify the intended destination.
''At first, we were not sure whether Thailand was a target or not,'' he said. ''But now it is quite clear that our country was being used as a transit area.''
Bangkok is a major hub for passport counterfeiting, drug trafficking and other illicit activities. A history of loose law enforcement has also attracted hundreds of international fugitives over the years. American officials say that Hezbollah does have a footprint here, using Bangkok as a center for a cocaine and money-laundering network.
There was some uncertainty about Mr. Hussein's documents. The Thai authorities said he was traveling with two passports, one Lebanese and one Swedish.
Anders Jorle, a spokesman for the Swedish Foreign Ministry, said the Swedish passport had expired, despite an image of the main page of the passport circulating in the Thai media that appears to show expiration in 2015.
Swedish officials have asked to meet with Mr. Hussein. ''We have not seen this person or met him,'' Mr. Jorle said by telephone from Stockholm. ''We cannot confirm whether he is a Swedish national.''
Mr. Hussein faces a maximum of five years in prison if convicted on the charge of possessing arms. The Thai authorities have distributed a sketch of a suspected associate, who is still at large.

HEADLINE: Under Pressure, Nigerian Leader Relents on Gas Price

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER; Ethan Bronner contributed reporting from Jerusalem, Rick Gladstone from New York and Simon Romero from Rio de Janeiro.

 BODY:
LAGOS, Nigeria -- Nigeria swallowed a hard lesson on Monday that has been inflicted on governments of developing nations the world over for years: try cutting subsidies for gas and the populace will erupt in rage.
Faced down by thousands of demonstrators, demands for his removal and a weeklong general strike that paralyzed his fractious country, President Goodluck Jonathan abruptly gave in, partly restoring the fuel subsidy that -- more than an Islamic insurgency in the north or a long-running conflict in the south -- seemed to crystallize the frustrations of the people and draw them to the streets in outrage.
''Government appreciates that the implementation of the deregulation policy would cause initial hardships,'' Mr. Jonathan said in a stiffly worded capitulation on Monday, after a week of refusing to back down.
Similar scenes have played out around the world in recent years, from Latin America to the Middle East to Asia, and the government response is frequently the same: give in quickly, despite the counsel of economists and international financial institutions that fuel subsidies are wasteful and distorting, sapping governments of money that could otherwise be used to improve education, public health or other needs. 
The Nigerian government spends about $8 billion a year on fuel subsidies, and getting rid of them would be ''an important first step'' to shoring up the finances of one of Africa's largest economies, according to a 2009 International Monetary Fund report.
But in resource-rich countries like Nigeria, with its enormous gap between rich and poor, subsidized gas is one of the few benefits trickling down from an infamously corrupt government that has pocketed billions of dollars in oil profits, with little to show for it.
For the poor -- and three-fourths of this country's population lives on about a dollar a day -- the fuel subsidy means a cheap ride to the market. It means lower prices for the food they buy there. And it means some sense of ownership in a national resource, oil, in which roughly 80 percent of the economic benefit has flowed to 1 percent of the population, according to some estimates.
''It's one of the few ways the urban and rural poor feel they benefit from this strategic resource,'' said Michael J. Watts, an expert on the politics of oil at the University of California, Berkeley. ''The fuel subsidy is experienced as one of the few things they get.''
That sentiment was strongly in evidence as the protests dwindled here on Monday. Under the rollback union leaders agreed to, gas in Nigeria will drop to about $2.27 a gallon from about $3.50 -- higher than the $1.70 price before Jan. 1, but low enough to end the strike.
Still, many Nigerians were disappointed that Mr. Jonathan had not dropped the price all the way back down.
''We are not benefitting from this oil!'' shouted Ali Mohammed, a motorcycle-taxi driver. ''No lights, no roads, no hospitals. Make him reduce the price. We are suffering in this country.''
Hundreds of other young men milled about close by in what has been a center of the protest here: the New Afrika Shrine nightclub of the Afro-beat star Femi Kuti, son of the Nigerian musician and dissident Fela Kuti.
In a speech Monday morning, Mr. Kuti both incited and calmed the crowd listening at his feet amid clouds of marijuana smoke, expressing disgust with Nigeria's institutions from his rickety wooden stage as supporters murmured their approval.
Later in his office, Mr. Kuti shouted at his television as he watched the labor leaders announce the end of the strike. ''I told you those people would back down,'' he said to his aides, looking up from the screen. As for the government, he said, ''They prosecute people for being gay, but there is no law against stealing 14 million.''
Nigeria has seen similar tumult over the issue in the past, and it is hardly alone. In Bolivia, protesters burned photos of President Evo Morales and vandalized government buildings in December 2010, forcing Mr. Morales to withdraw his subsidy-cutting measure only days after introducing it.
In Venezuela, before the rise of Hugo Chavez, days of riots and hundreds of deaths followed a fuel price rise in 1989. President Chavez now controls one of the world's most generous fuel subsidies, despite being critical of it.
In Jordan, an announcement last year that subsidies would be lifted helped inspire antigovernment demonstrations that forced a reversal. In Indonesia, a 30 percent increase in fuel prices in 2008 led to bloody rioting. Economists nonetheless praise that country for doing what others often do not: sweetening subsidy removal with cash programs that aid the poor.
Iran has employed a similar strategy, eliminating subsidized prices for fuel but cushioning the blow with cash payments of roughly $45 a month. The approach ''was critical in preventing the kind of thing that we're seeing happening in Nigeria,'' said Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, an economics professor at Virginia Tech, adding that other Middle East countries shouldering subsidies they can ill afford, most notably Egypt, are looking at Iran's plan as a possible model.
The International Monetary Fund and other global financial institutions do not like fuel subsidies, pointing out that the biggest benefits do not even go to the poor, but rather to the owners of large cars and big generators.
Yet it was not the wealthy in Nigeria, or even the small middle class, that forced Mr. Jonathan to back down most of the way.
''Even though most fuel subsidies go to the nonpoor, the fraction of their income that goes to fuel is much greater,'' said Shanta Devarajan, the World Bank's chief economist for Africa. ''That's why they feel the elimination of subsidies much more.''
On Monday in Lagos, the government appeared to be anticipating trouble, with army checkpoints on major roads, which were uncharacteristically deserted because of the strike.
In the end the day was calm, though a feeling of anger at the unions for calling off the strike, and at the government for not restoring the full subsidy, permeated Mr. Kuti's hangarlike nightclub.
The protest movement here, though brief, came to encompass frustrations broader than the sudden rise in fuel prices, and some of the young men milling about on Monday wore ''Occupy Nigeria'' T-shirts.
The protesters made it clear that the fuel subsidy removal -- abrupt and unaccompanied by any palliative measures -- was seen as one more act of insensitivity by a government they criticized for favoring the wealthy.
''We are the people, but they are not listening to us,'' said Tayo Sola, an unemployed university graduate. ''So what is the meaning of democracy? You are not ready to listen. So how can you govern?''

HEADLINE: Its Biotech Products Rejected In Europe, BASF to Refocus

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- BASF, the German chemical group, has abandoned efforts to sell genetically modified products in Europe, including its Amflora potato, because of overwhelming opposition to the technology, the company said Monday. 
''There is still a lack of acceptance for this technology in many parts of Europe -- from the majority of consumers, farmers and politicians,'' said Stefan Marcinowski, a board member with responsibilities for plant biotechnology. ''Therefore, it does not make business sense to continue investing in products exclusively for cultivation in this market.''
The company has instead decided to focus on ''attractive markets'' in the Americas and in Asia, he said.
The withdrawal of the potato leaves a type of corn produced by Monsanto as the only biotech crop grown in Europe.
A total of 140 jobs will be cut in Europe from the company's plant science unit, which was responsible for developing the Amflora potato, mainly for use in the paper industry, BASF said. Many of those jobs will be moved to the company's new plant science headquarters near Raleigh, North Carolina, and to other sites in Berlin and Belgium.
Although BASF does not yet sell any other genetically modified crops for cultivation in Europe, the company said it no longer had plans to market other potatoes, including a disease-resistant variety called Fortuna, and a disease-resistant variety of wheat.
Even so, the company said it would continue seeking authorizations to sell its potato products in Europe, a sign that the company was keeping its options open for the future. None of those potatoes, or the wheat, are currently marketed elsewhere in the world.
The decision by BASF is a sign of the difficulties for the biotechnology industries in Europe, including in areas like nanotechnology and animal cloning, said Carel du Marchie Sarvaas, a director at EuropaBio, an industry group.
''The sad irony is that we import biotechnology products into Europe, and that means we're probably paying more for them than we need to, and we're losing research jobs to the places where they're being produced,'' he said.
BASF's decision is a blow for the European Commission, which began a new push last year to allow farmers in Europe to grow gene-altered products in parts of the Union that accept the technology.
In so doing they hope to remove an irritant in trade relations with the United States and with other countries that use biotechnology, and to lower costs for European farmers and industry.
John Dalli, the E.U. commissioner for consumer safety, approved the genetically modified potato two years ago, the first such step in more than a decade.
Environmentalists reacted with fury to that decision, saying that Mr. Dalli had overstepped his mandate, and they cheered the news that BASF would stop trying to sell their biotech products in Europe.
''This is another nail in the coffin for genetically modified foods in Europe,'' said Adrian Bebb of the environmental group Friends of the Earth.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Young U.S. Citizens in Mexico Brave Risks for American Schools

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

 BODY:
TIJUANA, Mexico -- Weekday mornings at 5, when the lights on distant hillsides across the border still twinkle in the blackness, Martha, a high school senior, begins her arduous three-hour commute to school. She groggily unlocks the security gate guarded by the family Doberman and waits in the glare of the Pemex filling station for the bus to the border. Her fellow passengers, grown men with their arms folded, jostle her in their sleep.
Martha's destination, along with dozens of young friends -- United States citizens all living in ''TJ,'' as they affectionately call their city -- is a public high school eight miles away in Chula Vista, Calif., where they were born and where they still claim to live.
California teenagers start their mornings with crossing guards and school buses. Martha and her friends stand for hours in a human chain of 16,000 at the world's busiest international land border. Cellphones in one hand and notebooks in the other, they wait again to cross on foot, fearing delays that could force them to miss a social studies final, oblivious to hawkers selling breakfast burritos or weary parents holding toddlers in pajamas. 
In San Ysidro, the port of entry, they board a red trolley to another bus that takes them to school. They are sweating the clock -- the bell rings at 8 a.m. sharp.
''Most of the time I am really, really tired,'' said Martha, whose parents moved back to Tijuana because the cost of living was cheaper here than in southern California.
''I try to do my best,'' she added. ''But sometimes, I just can't.''
In the raging debate over immigration, almost all sides have come to agree on tougher enforcement at the border. But nearly unnoticed, frustration is focusing locally on border-crossers who are not illegal immigrants but young American citizens, whose families have returned to Mexico yet want their children to attend American schools.
Called ''transfronterizos,'' these students migrate between two cultures, two languages and two nations every day, straining the resources of public school districts and sparking debate among educators and sociologists over whether it is in American interests that they be taught in the United States. Although some Mexican families pay the steep tuition required of out-of-district students, most do not, and many that pay taxes out of their paychecks do not pay the property taxes that support public services.
Some of the students' parents are American citizens and some are Mexican.
Students like Martha fly under the radar in some school districts, while other districts assign truancy officers to find who they are. They live with the anxiety of potentially having to lie about their residency and the very real possibility that the prize they are after -- a decent education -- will be taken from them. Though their exact numbers are unknown, their presence reflects the daily complexities of border life -- among them, economic and educational disparities between the United States and Mexico and families splintered by deportation and unemployment.
Transfronterizos can be found from Calexico, Calif., to El Paso, where violence in neighboring Cuidad Juarez, Mexico, has led to the creation of a designated lane for 800 to 1,400 students daily, including American citizens who attend El Paso schools.
In Tijuana, Martha and a half-dozen high school seniors let a reporter accompany them on their daily commute and discussed their identity conflicts and criticisms by their American counterparts. Students, their parents and some teachers spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize their enrollment.
Martha's mother, a seamstress, never got beyond ninth grade. Several days a week, she rises at 2 a.m. to claim a place for her daughter in line -- a border mom, instead of a soccer or a tiger mom. Martha's family pitches in on the mortgage for a Chula Vista house, where members of the extended family live, and pays utilities to establish residency.
Other Tijuana families rent apartments, ''borrow'' fake addresses from friends or create a post office box. Sometimes a relative in the district is appointed their child's legal guardian.
''It's stressful,'' Martha says of the house that is not really her home. '' You can get found out and kicked out of school. Sometimes I feel bad for lying. But I'm just going to school.''
In so many ways, they are simply teenagers, wearing sneakers and the ubiquitous white buds in their ears. In the border line, the chit-chat about hangovers and how strict their parents are could be that of young people anywhere waiting to get into a movie.
Except for the narcotic detector dogs, the Customs and Border Patrol officers and the sign that says, ''Welcome to the United States.''
Luis, a wiry high school senior with gleaming braces, was born in Los Angeles and lived there as a freshman, spending the week in his uncle's home and weekends visiting his family in Tijuana. Homesick, he finally moved to Mexico.
''I felt bad alone,'' he said. ''It's tiring, but this way I can see my family all the days.''
Now he and his 16-year-old sister get up at 3 a.m. to drive to the border with their father, a landscaper who has a green card. The teens touch down for a shower at a studio apartment the family rents in the Chula Vista school district, and they walk two and a half miles to school. Luis's younger sister cannot join them -- she was born in Mexico. So were most of Luis's friends.
''They say, 'Oh man, it's too hard to wake up at 3 in the morning,' '' Luis said, sitting in his bedroom in Tijuana, which is decorated with posters of Piccadilly Circus, a place he has yet to visit. ''On the other hand,'' he said, ''they are jealous that I can cross and they can't.''
Although educational outcomes have greatly improved in Mexico, low high school graduation rates and high attrition rates in the northern industrial states of Baja California and Chihuahua ''hinder development of a highly educated work force,'' concluded a 1997 study by the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego.
''The gap between the U.S. and Mexican sides is great enough that people have a strong incentive'' to cross, said David Shirk, the institute's director.
Ana Sanchez, a Tijuana resident who works for a nonprofit organization in San Diego and pays United States income tax (although not property tax), wanted her two children to be fluent in English and enrolled them in a public school close to her job. ''I know that in the future it's going to be a plus for them,'' she said.
Initially, ''trying to be honest,'' Mrs. Sanchez told the district that her daughter lived in Tijuana. But when told she would have to pay $800 a month in tuition, ''that's when I got added to the electric bill at a friend's address,'' she explained.
For educators, determining whether a student meets residency requirements can be a thorny task, with rules varying from district to district and state to state. In San Ysidro, families must provide a mortgage or rental agreement and show utility bills in their name. Over the past two years the district has sent ''letters of exclusion'' to more than 20 families. In some cases, fraudulent documents were discovered. Manuel H. Paul, the superintendent, said educators were attuned to ''red flags'' like a phone call from a school nurse that reaches a disconnected number.
''The student will say, 'We live in Tijuana,' '' Mr. Paul said. ''Children most of the time don't lie.''
In 1982, the Supreme Court established that schools cannot inquire about a family's immigration status. Ed Brand, superintendent of the Sweetwater Union High School District in Chula Vista, says an American citizen living outside the county would pay tuition of $7,162.
''We're not the I.N.S.,'' he added, referring to the former Immigration and Naturalization Service. ''Can one get by us? I imagine one can.''
In nearby Calexico, a truant officer was dispatched to photograph students crossing the border, but the practice was deemed ''an exercise in futility'' and discontinued, said Richard Fragale, the superintendent of schools. He estimates that between 100 and 200 students cross each day, most not paying tuition. Ultimately, there are painful decisions for the district. Recently, he said, two parents were deported, leaving two children, both American citizens, in limbo.
''What do we do with these youngsters?'' he said. ''Philosophically, as an educator, if a young person comes to the door, we should educate them.''
In Ajo, Ariz., the state education office fined the district $1.2 million in May 2010, for the cost of educating 105 students crossing over from Mexico. The district has since tightened its residency requirements.
The issue is fairness, whether a student lives in Mexico or just outside a preferred school district in the United States, argues Steven A. Camarota, the research director for the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, which favors limits on immigration. The possibility that these individuals could ''pay enough in taxes to cover the costs of consumption of public services is basically zero,'' he said.
Martha and her friends view classmates who live in the district as coddled couch potatoes. They don't have to deal with jeering workers at the border cursing them for cutting in line. Or say ''wake me up'' to the Tijuana taxi driver who drives them home after dark.
Jesus travels 20 miles from Tijuana, on a twisting road known for robberies. He plans to study gastronomy. ''I am just trying to get ahead and become someone important in life,'' he says. ''It's a big responsibility making sure you get to school.'' Five tardys can mean four hours of Saturday school and an F in citizenship.
''You can kill their future,'' says one of Jesus's teachers, who does not mark him late when he knocks shyly on the classroom door 10 minutes into first period.
Martha has crossed the border on and off since she was 5. Her life has its own ebb and flow, as well as the occasional undertow. In Tijuana, ''sometimes people think we're higher than them,'' she says, because she attends an American high school. But as a Mexican in San Diego, ''they look you up and down.'' Divulging the particulars of their lives can be tricky business. ''You can't really rely on most people,'' Martha says.
Rising at 3 a.m., Luis will sometimes fall asleep in his sixth-period world history class. ''The teacher gets super-angry,'' he said. '''You don't tell those kind of teachers you cross.''
He shares his story sparingly with a few trusted Latino teachers. ''Some of them crossed, like you. They want things to be better for you. But,'' he allows, ''that is not true of everyone. Some think we're wasting tax.''
One teacher in Chula Vista, whose name was withheld to protect students in his class, including Martha, said, ''I can't draw all I want from her. Her intelligence is hidden away by her tiredness.''
Yet teachers and guidance counselors say that despite the academic challenges, students who get up at 4 a.m. to be at school show signs of becoming resilient leaders. ''They know who are they are and what they want,'' the teacher observed. ''They're not going to be working at Jack in the Box. They're go-getters.''

HEADLINE: The Invisible Hand Behind Bonuses on Wall Street

BYLINE: By KEVIN ROOSE

 BODY:
When asked about his job at cocktail parties, Alan Johnson has a curiosity-piquing line.
''You know those big paydays on Wall Street?'' he says, typically waiting a beat to deliver the punch line. ''I have something to do with them.''
Mr. Johnson, a consultant who speaks with a light twang from his native Alabama, has never worked for a bank. Nor will his company, Johnson Associates, pay million-dollar bonuses to any of its 12 employees this year. But as one of the nation's foremost financial compensation specialists, Mr. Johnson is among a small group of behind-the-scenes information brokers who help determine how Wall Street firms distribute billions of dollars to their workers.
''The misunderstanding many people have about this industry is that pay is whimsical,'' Mr. Johnson said in a recent interview at his company's Manhattan office. ''It's not.'' 
Compensation consulting is an obscure corner of the management consulting industry, where practitioners operate in the shadows of high finance. Large Wall Street banks, as well as hedge funds and private equity shops, rely on such consultants to help them structure bonus payouts and devise severance packages, and to provide data on what competitors pay.
''You can give them some insights,'' Mr. Johnson said of his clients, who have included the boards of Credit Suisse and Lehman Brothers. ''You can say to them, 'You're being too wimpy this time,' or, 'You were being too aggressive last time.' ''
This year's bonus season, which began in late December and will continue until February at some companies, is expected to be the worst for industry employees since 2008, as regulatory measures and economic uncertainty have cut deeply into profits and made pay pools smaller.
In his annual compensation survey, a closely watched report that was sent to roughly 800 of the company's clients in November, Mr. Johnson estimated that bonuses in the industry would fall 20 to 30 percent from last year's levels.
That would still leave employees at firms like Goldman Sachs, where the average worker took home $430,700 in total compensation in 2010, much better off than workers in other industries. But it would represent further slippage from the sector's highs before the crisis.
Bonus math in a financial downturn is a delicate art. Because the payments typically make up at least half of an employee's yearly pay, erring on the low side can mean losing a star performer to a rival firm.
''Someone on Wall Street might go apoplectic when he heard he got $3 million and another guy got $3.5 million,'' Mr. Johnson said.
Decades ago, banks determined bonuses according to a relatively simple formula that took into account an employee's seniority and performance. After the financial crisis, as politicians and regulators began criticizing what they saw as eye-popping pay packages, those all-cash bonuses went out of fashion.
Now, Wall Street pay packages routinely include deferred cash payments and restricted stock awards that can be redeemed only after multiyear waiting periods.
The increased complexity of Wall Street compensation has been a boon for consulting businesses, which can charge hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for advice. Goldman Sachs has used the consultancy Semler Brossy; Morgan Stanley's directors have relied on the Hay Group; and Bank of America's board has used the services of Frederic W. Cook & Company, according to public filings by those banks. All three consulting companies, and all three banks, declined to comment.
Some consultants are hired by banks merely to provide data on industry compensation trends, or to rubber-stamp the decisions of the banks' internal compensation teams, while others are more directly involved in setting pay levels.
''Directors don't want to be embarrassed in the media by a compensation decision,'' said Yale D. Tauber, a compensation consultant who works with the board of Citigroup, among other clients. ''They're the guardians of investors' capital.''
Being a Wall Street pay specialist often means being on call for emergencies. Michael Karp, the managing partner of the Options Group, was awakened by a 4 a.m. telephone call while vacationing in Hawaii. The caller, a bank executive based in London, told Mr. Karp that December profits had come in below expectations. The company already planned to reduce its year-end bonuses 35 percent, and with the new numbers, it looked as if even deeper cuts would be necessary.
''He wanted me to gauge what other competitors were doing,'' said Mr. Karp, who immediately began using his BlackBerry to e-mail his contacts in the industry.
For the Options Group, which is primarily an executive search business, one advantage of interviewing thousands of Wall Street employees a year is accumulating extensive salary information. That information is used to estimate for clients what, for example, a crude oil trader with five years of experience should be paid, Mr. Karp said.
''The big question is: how do you pay people fairly, but in line with their peers?'' he said. ''If everyone's pay is down 35 percent, and your firm's pay is down 25 percent, people may not be happy about it, but they'll accept it.''
To come up with a recent recommendation for a hedge fund executive who wanted to figure out how much to pay one of his senior employees, Mr. Karp made calls and used the Option Group's compensation guide, a detailed annual report that sells for $11,000 a copy. He told the executive that a reasonable bonus for the employee, given the probable pay levels of rival firms, would be $650,000 to $800,000. That put the executive's proposed bonus of about $750,000 squarely within range.
Mr. Johnson, whose business does not do executive search, relies on public filings, analysts' reports and information from industry insiders to compile his compensation data. He says that although he has been responsible for helping firms devise extravagant pay packages -- in one case, a single package worth about $100 million -- he does so only because the competitive market requires it.
''From my personal political standpoint, I wish people got paid less,'' Mr. Johnson said of his Wall Street clients. ''But my guiding star is not my political belief.''
Predictions about this year's dismal bonuses have no doubt disappointed financiers on Wall Street, who often complain that they are underpaid even when all evidence points to the contrary. But for a compensation consultant, breaking bad news to people unaccustomed to hearing it is often part of the job.
''I take no glee in saying that things are going to be bad,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''Up is better for everybody. But people need the facts.''

HEADLINE: Oversight of Cruise Lines at Issue After Disaster

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Reporting was contributed by Gaia Pianigiani from Giglio, Italy; David Jolly, Scott Sayare and Maia de la Baume from Paris; James Kanter from Brussels; Alan Cowell and Julia Werdigier from London; and Henry Fountain, Peter Lattman and Rick Gladstone from New York.

 BODY:
PARIS -- As the world was transfixed by the Titanic-like imagery of the partly submerged Costa Concordia and the frantic efforts to save the fuel-laden vessel in rough seas off the Tuscany coast, questions swirled on Monday about the enormous cruise line industry, which operates without much regulation.
The ship's detained captain, Francesco Schettino, was accused by his bosses of deviating from a fixed, computerized course to show off his beautiful $563 million boat, carrying more than 4,200 passengers and crew members, to the people of Giglio Island on a still Friday night, crashing it on a reef.
But as shares in the ship's parent company -- Carnival Corporation of Miami, the world's biggest cruise line operator -- slid by nearly a fifth and the owners and insurers tried to add up the cost of the disaster, there were more troubling issues raised about how the cruise industry is supervised and controlled. 
Those issues included how much safety information and training are required for the crew and passengers, and how much discretion a captain has to alter routes, especially in an age when electronic radar, charts, GPS and other guidance systems are supposed to keep these large, sleek ships on course.
''There are legitimate questions as these vessels have substantially evolved in recent years,'' said Helen Kearns, a spokeswoman for Siim Kallas, the European Union transportation commissioner. ''The boats have gotten a lot bigger, as it's economically advantageous to have more passengers,'' she said. ''But the way these vessels have grown in size does mean finding the right balance to make sure regulations are stringent enough to ensure there are procedures like safe evacuations.''
More than 72 hours after the accident killed at least six people, confusion still reigned over how many were missing. Italy's coast guard abruptly raised the total to 29 late Monday after having said 16, including 2 Americans, remained unaccounted for. Worries also grew that the ship's half-million gallons of fuel could leak into a marine wildlife sanctuary.
While airline pilots are directed and guided by controllers on the ground, sea captains are considered to be in complete control. ''It's not like the aircraft industry, where you file a flight plan,'' said Peter Wild, a cruise industry consultant at G. P. Wild (International) Limited, a consultancy outside London. Rather, at most cruise lines, company directors determine the routes, which are then transmitted to the captain and a navigating officer, who scrutinize the charted course but are meant to follow it.
Captain Schettino's boss, Pier Luigi Foschi, insisted that a safe route had been programmed into the navigating computers and that alarms would have sounded for any deviation. ''This route was put in correctly,'' said Mr. Foschi, who is chairman of Costa Crociere S.p.A.
''The fact that it left from this course is due solely to a maneuver by the commander that was unapproved, unauthorized and unknown to Costa,'' he said at an emotional press conference in Genoa. ''He wanted to show the ship, to go nearby this island of Giglio, so he decided to change the course of the ship,'' Mr. Foschi said, admitting that the ship had done a similar but approved maneuver last summer for a festival.
The captain, who may face criminal charges of manslaughter, failure to offer assistance and abandonment of the ship, had said he struck an uncharted rock.
But an Italian prosecutor, Francesco Verusio, had harsh words on Monday. ''We are struck by the unscrupulousness of the reckless maneuver that the commander of the Costa Concordia made near the island of Giglio,'' he told reporters. ''It was inexcusable.''
For many years, the global cruise line industry has operated under a loosely defined system that tends to escape scrutiny by courts and regulators. Cruise line instances of crime, pollution and safety and health violations have often gone unpoliced because no single authority is in charge.
A United Nations agency, the International Maritime Organization, oversees maritime safety through international conventions, including one for the Safety of Life at Sea, known as Solas, adopted in 1914, which grew out of the global anger that stemmed from the loss of the Titanic in 1912. But the agency has no policing powers.
Ships themselves are certified and inspected by independent classification societies, like Lloyd's Register Group and the Italian RINA S.p.A., Mr. Wild said, that perform annual checks of ship safety conditions, lifeboats and the like. They approve vital components like fire protection, navigation, radio communication equipment, deck gear, cables and anchors.
While electronic systems are standard on ships like the Costa Concordia, all ships are also required to carry paper charts, said Angus Menzies, a retired British Navy commodore who is now chief executive of the Honorable Company of Master Mariners, a professional association in London for qualified sea captains.
''But I'd suspect that on a modern cruise liner like that he'd be using electronic charts,'' Mr. Menzies said. To hit an uncharted rock ''nowadays that's unlikely, but it's possible,'' he said. ''The other possibility is that they were just a shower of turkeys -- incompetent -- on the bridge.''
But the captain is king on his ship, Mr. Menzies said. ''The man on the bridge decides everything.''
Michael Bruno, dean of the engineering school at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., and chairman of the Marine Board of the National Research Council, said that if there were obstacles on the charts, electronic or paper, the crew should have seen them. ''There are probably many people in the field who would say that you don't need an electronic chart to tell you you're close to rocks,'' he said.
''One of the things to keep in mind is the accuracy of all of these systems,'' Mr. Bruno added. Even with GPS, he said, ''accuracy is measured in yards, sometimes tens of feet. The difference between hitting a submerged obstacle and not hitting it can sometimes be a matter of feet.''
Questions also loomed about why the Costa Concordia listed so badly after the crash, as the captain tried to bring it closer to the island. Modern ships are built to sink levelly, Mr. Menzies said, by the use of bulkhead doors and pumps that are supposed to be able to be operated remotely. ''The worst-case scenario is trying to get non-seafarers off a ship that is capsizing.''
That was certainly the case on board the Costa Concordia Friday night. Passengers described delays and confusion, with unclear instructions and inexperienced crew members. Emily Lau, 27, and her husband, Benji Smith, 34, an American honeymoon couple on board, told ABC's ''Good Morning America'' that ''it was every man for himself,'' Ms. Lau said. ''The main thing is no one knew how to help because they were never trained. That is the cruise ship's fault.''
Cruise passengers are supposed to attend a safety briefing within 24 hours of boarding. ''We have never had any drills,'' Ms. Lau said. ''We were asked to go for a safety meeting, and it was nothing but a sales pitch for excursions.''
The accident and the constantly televised images of the elegant ship lying grotesquely will hurt the cruise industry at a crucial period, when global economic uncertainty is rampant and summer bookings are at a peak, analysts said. Carnival and other companies had already dropped prices in the face of weaker demand, especially in Europe, which provides 40 percent of its business. About one-third of all cruise bookings are made in the wintry first quarter of the year.
Investors jettisoned the stocks of cruise operators on Monday. Shares of Carnival, which trades in London, dropped about 17 percent, the most in a decade. (United States markets were closed Monday in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.)
The company estimated the financial impact of the disaster to be as much as $95 million, with the ship out of service for the rest of 2012. But the impact is bound to be much more, said James Rollo, a leisure-industry analyst at Morgan Stanley, who said that the Costa subsidiary is 17 percent of Carnival's capacity.
''Cruising is a safer way to travel than air, but the investigation may take time, the story is getting global publicity, and people are unlikely to book until confidence returns,'' Mr. Rollo said.
Insurers, too, are expected to take a short-term hit. Nick Johnson, an analyst at Numis, a London research firm, estimated total insurance losses of at least $600 million. In a note to clients, he forecast stricter risk assessments because of what he called ''the psychological impact of seeing the unthinkable happen.''
Correction: January 18, 2012, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about the Costa Concordia, the luxury cruise liner that ran aground late Friday off the Tuscany coast, misstated, in some copies, the amount of fuel it was carrying. It was half a million gallons, not half a billion.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 24, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Tuesday about the Costa Concordia shipwreck in Italy misstated the vessel's value when it went into service in 2006. It was 450 million euros or about $563 million -- not $450 million. The error was repeated on Wednesday in two articles about the shipwreck and in articles on Thursday and Friday.

HEADLINE: When Breakthroughs Begin at Home

BYLINE: By RITCHIE S. KING

 BODY:
Cathal Garvey's home laboratory in Cork, Ireland, is filled with makeshift equipment. His incubator for bacteria is an old Styrofoam shipping box with a heating mat and thermometer that he has modified into a thermostat. He uses a pressure cooker to sterilize instead of an autoclave. Some instruments are fashioned from coffee cans.
In the burgeoning world of citizen science, where the ethos is closer to scout manual than peer-reviewed journal, Mr. Garvey, a 26-year-old geneticist who worked in a cancer research center for about four years after earning a graduate degree, is something of a hero. He is perhaps best known for inventing the DremelFuge, a small centrifuge that can be fabricated by a 3-D printer. His plans are freely available online, so anybody who has the desire and the resources to make one can do so. 
He and other scientific improvisers, or bio-hackers, are part of a movement called DIYbio, short for do-it-yourself biology, which got its official start in 2008 with DIYBio.org, an online hub for sharing ideas. The site has grown to more than 2,000 members since its inception.
''I want to generate the sort of tools that make it easy to do DIYbio at home,'' Mr. Garvey said.
One of the movement's rallying points is Genspace, a nonprofit laboratory in Brooklyn that is open to members of the public, regardless of scientific background. Since it opened in 2010, on the seventh floor of an old bank building, similar labs have sprouted in Boston and San Francisco.
Genspace has roughly a dozen members, and each pays $100 a month to cover rent and what laboratory people call consumables: chemical agents, disposable tubes and other paraphernalia that need to be replaced regularly.
The initial concept, said Daniel Grushkin, a journalist based in Brooklyn who was a founder of Genspace, is similar to the ethos of open-source software development: If you get as many brains as possible working collaboratively on biotechnology, ''you might get a really good idea.''
The idea of amateurs doing their own biology has raised fears about both deliberate bioterrorism and the unintentional creation of a deadly disease. But making a new and virulent pathogen is far from easy, and the DIYbio community has adopted a set of safety standards to minimize such risks.
''Within a very narrow scope, it's possible that somebody could cause harm,'' Mr. Garvey said. ''But they could only cause a disease to emerge if they were working with disease.''
Genspace has a strict policy against working with anything that can infect humans, and it has established a safety review board of experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the United States Department of Health and Human Services and other institutions to approve proposals for new experiments.
To DIY enthusiasts, one of the most frustrating things can be the pace. Biology involves working with organisms that, like infants, need attention at specific times.
''So much of biology is just waiting,'' said Charlie Schick, a Boston-based member of DIYbio who runs a blog called Molecularist. And getting a temperature wrong or adding an incorrect chemical means that an experiment has to be started all over again.
An even bigger hurdle is all the expensive gear: Cheap centrifuges and polymerase chain-reaction machines cost about $3,000 each. Genspace, for example, could not have acquired all of its equipment with membership dues alone: A founder and the current president, Ellen D. Jorgensen, previously worked at a private lab that decided to offload equipment after the recession forced it to downsize. She volunteered to take the jettisoned instruments.
Still, some bio-hackers think that what is needed is simpler and cheaper lab equipment.
''People vastly overestimate the cost of running a biotech lab,'' Mr. Garvey said. The cost of his home laboratory? Four thousand euros, he said -- about $5,000.

HEADLINE: Decline of an Island Pastime

BYLINE: By JORGE CASTILLO

 BODY:
SAN JUAN, P.R. -- This used to be the climax of baseball's peak season in Puerto Rico. The storied winter league lured many of Major League Baseball's biggest Puerto Rican stars back to the island -- from Roberto Clemente and Orlando Cepeda to Roberto Alomar and Bernie Williams -- and they would regularly play before tens of thousands of fans during what was otherwise their off-season.
But that scene no longer exists. Four years after being forced to cancel an entire season, the league has only four teams. And for the first time in its history, which dates to 1938, the Puerto Rican Baseball League does not have a team based in San Juan, the capital.
The league's struggles are merely the most vivid manifestation of a more profound, and surprising, phenomenon playing out here: the decline of baseball in a place where it was long considered the primary pastime, if not a religion. After decades of populating major league rosters with All-Stars at every position, Puerto Rico had only 20 players on Major League Baseball rosters on opening day last season. Only two made the All-Star team. (By contrast, the 1997 All-Star Game included eight Puerto Ricans.) 
''We can't even compete in the Pan American Games anymore,'' said the major leaguer Alex Cora, referring to Puerto Rico's seventh-place finish in the eight-team tournament in October.
No one here disputes the diminished stature of baseball in Puerto Rico, and most agree on the culprit: Major League Baseball's decision, in 1990, to include Puerto Rico, a commonwealth of the United States, in its first-year player draft. This means Puerto Rican players must wait until they have completed high school to sign a professional contract, and then they are going up against players from the United States and Canada in the draft.
Perhaps more important, major league teams have less incentive to cultivate talent in Puerto Rico because those players may end up with another team through the draft.
Catcher Ivan Rodriguez, 40, currently a free agent and playing for one of the Puerto Rican winter league's four teams, is the last active Puerto Rican major leaguer to avoid the draft. Rodriguez, a likely Hall of Famer, signed with the Texas Rangers in 1988 at age 16.
''What is the difference between 1980 and 2011? The draft,'' David Bernier, Puerto Rico's former secretary of sport and recreation, said in an interview in his office here. ''Nothing has changed but the draft. Everything else is the same.''
Caribbean nations like Venezuela and the Dominican Republic have not been forced to be part of the draft, and players from many other nations can sign with major league teams as free agents as young as 16. As a result, teams have abandoned Puerto Rico for Venezuela and the Dominican Republic, where they invest hundreds of millions of dollars in academies.
''The draft has had a large effect on the Puerto Rican baseball player,'' said Alomar, who was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., in July. ''A lot of youngsters don't have the economic resources to play and go to college. For me, it isn't what is best for us.''
Alomar said he hoped that Major League Baseball ''realizes what is happening with the talent here and they give us the opportunity to be like the Dominican Republic is and Venezuela is, so we can have more players signed.''
Only a handful of major league teams have full-time scouts on the island, and most clubs rely on a couple of tournaments a year to scout players. The limited exposure for Puerto Ricans means players outside the metropolitan area are more likely to be overlooked.
''They abandoned us a little, and we fell hard,'' said Tony Rodriguez, a former major leaguer who is an instructor at Puerto Rico's first baseball academy.
Baseball officials here note that Puerto Rico has a major disadvantage when competing against American talent because high school baseball is almost nonexistent on the island. Instead, players hone their craft on teams in American Legion ball and the Pony League. Many players in rural areas are forced to travel to cities where the better teams and leagues play.
Bernier said Puerto Rico was not prepared to be included in the draft, but even if it were given time, there was not much it could do to change its current model of development.
''We have had the same model here for 60 years,'' said Bernier, now the president of the Puerto Rican Olympic Committee. ''We can't change our model to what they have in the United States. We don't have enough space on the island for baseball fields for high schools. This island is full.''
In 2007, Bernier met with Major League Baseball officials about the topic and suggested a 10-year exclusion from the draft. He maintains his stance.
''That's the only way we'll know if the problem is the draft or not,'' Bernier said. ''And I guarantee you we would do a lot better. No one has been able to counter my argument about the draft, and that would prove the problem is the draft.''
But not everyone says the draft is the main issue. Some, like Sandy Alderson, the general manager of the Mets and a former consultant for Major League Baseball who handled issues in Latin America, said Puerto Rico's socioeconomic status -- somewhere between the United States and the Dominican Republic -- left it in a peculiar position.
''From a socioeconomic standpoint, things have changed quite a bit in Puerto Rico,'' he said. ''There are lots of other ways to spend your time. In the Dominican Republic, on the other hand, unfortunately, poor kids who are playing ball and who are from the lowest economic strata in that country, baseball is a way to escape, so there's a greater concentration of players and effort. I think they're just very different dynamics than Puerto Rico.''
Like Alderson, Cora, a 13-year veteran of the major leagues who became a free agent in October, says the draft is only part of the problem. Cora said more needed to be done to develop Puerto Rican talent: better coaching, more structure in leagues across the island and more government aid, for example. He conceded that the system had hurt Puerto Ricans' exposure to major league clubs.
''It's an excuse,'' Cora said of blaming the draft. ''This is the situation we're in, and we have to deal with it. We need to make adjustments and prepare our prospects.''
Adjusting to the situation has proved difficult for Puerto Rico. One attempt has been the creation of baseball academies.
Unlike those in the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, the Puerto Rican Baseball Academy and High School, which began in August 2002, is financed by Major League Baseball as a whole, not by individual franchises.
Situated in Gurabo, a northeastern city, the academy has high schoolers from all over the island descend on its modest one-building campus.
The students go to class from 8 in the morning until noon, eat lunch, then board buses to baseball fields in the surrounding area -- the academy does not have its own fields -- to practice until 4 p.m.
The academy, which has 12 teachers and 16 baseball instructors, has had 70 players drafted upon graduation and more than 400 sent to colleges in the United States. But it has yet to produce a prospect who reached the major leagues.
This year the academy has two senior shortstops projected to go in the first round of the June draft: Jesmuel Valentin and Edwin Correa.
''We identified that Puerto Rico needed more structure for talent,'' the headmaster Lucy Batista said. ''Not everyone will play professionally, but almost all can play collegiately and study to become a professional in something else.''
The academy receives $400,000 annually from Major League Baseball.
''There's no question the model works,'' said Lou Melendez, the vice president for international baseball operations for Major League Baseball. ''The problem is those models are very expensive, because when you start operating an academic school, it costs a lot of money.''
An academy may not be necessary if M.L.B. removes Puerto Rico's apparent competitive disadvantage by going to a worldwide draft, which would include players from every country. The original intent behind including Puerto Rico in the draft was that it was the initial step toward such a draft. Because Puerto Rico is an American commonwealth, it was the obvious place to begin.
The expansion of the draft has not taken place, but the major leagues may be drifting in that direction. The new collective bargaining agreement, signed in November, establishes limits on the amount clubs can spend in a country. In addition, Melendez said, a committee has been created to explore putting an international draft in place.
''You may see one in a year or two -- in 2013 or 2014,'' he said.
Meanwhile, baseball officials in Puerto Rico are watching the sport deteriorate. Bernier, Puerto Rico's former secretary of sport, said that the number of children who play baseball had not declined but that the diminished winter league and the relative dearth of Puerto Ricans in the major leagues were causes for concern.
''I think M.L.B. recognizes the problem, and they have every right to include us in the draft,'' Bernier said. ''It's their decision, and we have to try to adjust accordingly. But with the way things are, Puerto Ricans are slowly becoming less enthusiastic about baseball, and that can become a vicious cycle.''

To the Editor:
Re ''A Dimly Flickering Light in a Darkened Downtown'' (Lorain Journal, Jan. 8): 
Outsourcing and the Wall Street-induced recession have indeed exacted a terrible toll on Lorain and other northern Ohio cities whose economies were based on manufacturing. Yet you overlooked the resilience of that community and its fierce determination to create new jobs by building on its strengths.
Lorain recently attracted several hundred new jobs to Republic Steel, heralding a rebirth in that core industry. The region's auto sector is on the rebound. And Lorain County Community College, one of the top community colleges in America according to the Aspen Institute, is leading the way on sensor and advanced energy technology through its Entrepreneurship Innovation Center.
There's another side to the story in Lorain. It's how the community is working mightily to build a new future. Come back and let us show you new shoots under the old, where Lorain is reigniting the American Dream.

HEADLINE: Iran Face-Off Testing Obama The Candidate

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The escalating American confrontation with Iran poses a major new political threat to President Obama as he heads into his campaign for re-election, presenting him with choices that could harm either the economic recovery or his image as a firm leader.
Sanctions against Iran's oil exports that the president signed into law on New Year's Eve started a fateful clock ticking. In late June, when the campaign is in full swing, Mr. Obama will have to decide whether to take action against countries, including some staunch allies, if they continue to buy Iranian oil through its central bank.
After fierce lobbying by the White House, which opposed this hardening in the sanctions that have been its main tool in pressuring Tehran, Congress agreed to modify the legislation to give Mr. Obama leeway to delay action if he concludes the clampdown would disrupt the oil market. He may also invoke a waiver to exempt any country from sanctions based on national security considerations.
But using either of those escape hatches could open the president to charges that he is weak on Iran, which is viewed by Western powers as determined to achieve a nuclear weapons capability and which has drawn a tough response from Europe as well. 
Republican candidates, led by Mitt Romney, have threatened to use military action to prevent Tehran from building a bomb, and have criticized Mr. Obama for not doing enough to stop it from joining the nuclear club.
''If we re-elect Barack Obama, Iran will have a nuclear weapon,'' Mr. Romney declared in South Carolina in November. ''And if we elect Mitt Romney, they will not have a nuclear weapon.''
Few inside the administration see a surefire way of preventing Iran from crossing the nuclear weapons threshold, though none are ready to discuss moving to a focus on containing a nuclear Iran.
The administration is deeply reluctant to use military action, and the United States strenuously denied involvement in the recent killing of an Iranian nuclear scientist. Instead, it has focused mainly on using economic pressure to make Iran pay a high price for expanding its nuclear efforts despite international sanctions.
''To appear to back off, when the Iranians are proceeding pell-mell with their nuclear program, would be very difficult for the administration, particularly in an election year,'' said Stuart E. Eizenstat, a former senior official at the Treasury and State Departments who helped draft sanctions against Iran during the Clinton administration.
''On the other hand,'' he said, ''sanctions could harm the economy and his re-election chances. It is an excruciatingly difficult set of choices, and one he will face sooner rather than later.''
Senator Mark Steven Kirk, an Illinois Republican who sponsored the sanctions bill, along with Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, added another variable to the president's difficult calculus, arguing that sanctions may be the only thing that dissuades Israel from mounting a pre-emptive military strike on Iran's nuclear installations.
''The first waiver would trigger a whole lot of other waiver applications, potentially gutting the policy,'' he said. ''The more you gut the policy, the more likely you make military action by Israel. The pro-Israel community would not want a gutting of the sanctions.''
The administration says that it plans to put the sanctions in effect rigorously, and that the modifications it negotiated with Congress will allow Mr. Obama to do so without rattling the oil market. The European Union is expected to impose its own sanctions on Iran's oil exports next week, making it easier for the United States to carry out its measures.
Administration officials point to some encouraging signs: major importers of Iranian oil, like Japan and South Korea, are searching for alternative suppliers. And Iran's currency, the rial, has plummeted since the sanctions were signed, raising pressure on the government.
Referring to the tense negotiations with Congress, a senior Treasury official said, ''It was a question of tactics and timing, not the target.''
With his ending of the Iraq war and the killings of Osama bin Laden and other leaders of Al Qaeda, Mr. Obama has projected an air of competence on national security, and he is arguably less vulnerable in that field than previous Democratic presidents.
But trying to influence the world's oil market is a different kind of challenge, experts say. Already, Iran's leaders are maneuvering to drive up oil prices, whether to signal that sanctions could bring repercussions, or to mitigate the effects of reduced sales. Iran's threat to shut off the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of the world's oil passes, sent prices soaring this month.
''Oil has to be replaced with more oil,'' said Daniel Yergin, an oil expert who has written a book, ''The Quest,'' about energy security. Cutting off one of the world's leading oil exporters without squeezing the overall flow of oil is an extremely complex undertaking, he said. ''I'm hard pressed to think of a precedent for this,'' he added.
Then, too, there is the fragile state of the economy, even with recent signs of life in the job market. An oil crisis is one of those shocks, like a collapse of the euro, that could derail the recovery. Fears about rising oil prices led the White House to oppose efforts on Capitol Hill to impose draconian sanctions against Iran's central bank.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, in a letter last month to the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said a total crackdown on the central bank could undermine the administration's ''carefully phased'' approach and ''yield a net economic benefit to the Iranian regime.''
But the administration found itself dealing with a rare bipartisan show of resolve. The sanctions passed the Senate by a unanimous vote, almost unheard of in today's contentious atmosphere. The bill was attached to a crucial $662 billion military spending bill.
Under the terms of the legislation, Mr. Obama must, within 180 days, cut off access to the United States to any public or private financial institution that buys oil through the Central Bank of Iran. The goal is, effectively, to shut down the central bank, depriving the Iranian government of financing for its nuclear activities.
Mr. Obama retains two important levers: he can delay sanctions if he determines there is not enough oil in the market, and he can exempt any country that has ''significantly reduced its volume of crude oil purchases from Iran.'' Administration officials, seeking to preserve flexibility, said they would not quantify ''significant.''
An early test of the administration's approach will come at the end of February, when the law mandates that it cut off private financial institutions that conduct non-oil transactions with Iran's central bank, except for the sale of food, medicine and medical devices.
Senator Kirk said carrying out the oil sanctions might be less complicated than it appeared, with Saudi Arabia pledging to step up production and with Libya and Iraq both bringing production back online. But the administration's opposition to the original draft of his legislation, he said, belied the president's threats to the Iranian government.
''It's been a strange political journey for the president because he said he was tough on Iran,'' Mr. Kirk said.

HEADLINE: Forceful Attack Against Romney In G.O.P. Debate

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG; Erik Eckholm contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. -- Mitt Romney withstood forceful attacks during a debate here on Monday evening, with his Republican rivals lining up to question his job-creation record, wealth and character, as they implored voters to scrutinize his candidacy more deeply before allowing him to sail to the party's presidential nomination.
With five days remaining before the South Carolina primary, the four other remaining Republican candidates sought once again to raise questions about Mr. Romney's credentials as an economic manager and his consistency as a conservative.
Yet they failed to goad him into losing his composure or making any major mistakes, and he devoted nearly as much attention to President Obama as he did to the candidates on stage with him. 
A spirited crowd of nearly 3,000 Republicans inside the Myrtle Beach Convention Center loudly cheered -- and occasionally jeered -- throughout the two-hour debate. It was one of the most rollicking presidential debates of the season, with the candidates absorbing instant feedback from voters who will help decide their fate on Saturday.
''My record is out there -- proud of it,'' Mr. Romney said. ''I think that if people want to have someone who understands how the economy works, having worked in the real economy, then I'm the guy that can best post up against Barack Obama.''
But from the moment the debate began, Mr. Romney was besieged by his opponents, all of whom are trying to survive the winnowing process of the early primaries and emerge as a singular challenger to him. They pointedly called on him to disclose his tax returns, explain whether his corporate buyout firm Bain Capital had created or killed jobs and account for his evolving views on social issues like abortion.
''Mitt, we need for you to release your income tax so that the people of this country can see how you made your money,'' said Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. ''As Republicans, we cannot fire our nominee in September. We need to know now.''
Mr. Romney, a multimillionaire who has declined to release returns that could shed new light on the tax rate that he pays, said he would consider reversing course. But he said he would not do so until April, by which point the Republican competition may well be over.
Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker, defended the withering criticism he has helped lead of Mr. Romney's business background. Mr. Gingrich said he was not attacking American capitalism and, if anything, was fulfilling a duty to the party so it knew its nominee's vulnerabilities before making a final choice about who should face Mr. Obama in the general election.
''We need to satisfy the country,'' Mr. Gingrich said, ''that whoever we nominate has a record that can stand up to Barack Obama in a very effective way.''
Here in South Carolina, the third stop in the Republican nominating contest, the airwaves are filled with ads from candidates and groups known as ''super PACS'' that support the candidates without being directly tied to their campaigns. The advertisements provoked a series of lively exchanges between Mr. Romney and his rivals.
Mr. Gingrich sarcastically dismissed Mr. Romney's protestations that he had nothing to do with a super PAC ad attacking Mr. Gingrich. He said Mr. Romney's defense ''makes you wonder how much influence he would have if he were president.''
In reply, Mr. Romney said the outside group supporting Mr. Gingrich was showing an anti-Romney documentary that has been widely criticized for its misleading claims about Mr. Romney's work at Bain Capital. He called it ''probably the biggest hoax since Bigfoot.''
Yet Mr. Gingrich, who is trailing Mr. Romney narrowly in some polls here, was in top debate form and often seemed to overshadow Rick Santorum, who is battling Mr. Gingrich to emerge as a more conservative alternative to Mr. Romney.
In fact, Mr. Gingrich won some of his loudest and most sustained applause when the liberal Fox News analyst Juan Williams pressed him on his call for schoolchildren to work as janitors, for his description of Mr. Obama as a ''food stamp president'' and remarks that Mr. Williams said, to loud boos, seemed ''intended to belittle the poor.''
At one point rolling his eyes, cocking his head to the side and saying with mock impatience, ''Well, first of all, Juan,'' Mr. Gingrich seemed to revel in using Mr. Williams as a foil.
''The fact is more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history,'' Mr. Gingrich said, a claim that is numerically true but ignored the depth of the recession that Mr. Obama inherited when he took office. ''I know that among the politically correct, you're not supposed to use facts that are uncomfortable.''
The field of Republican candidates had been narrowed to five as they gathered for their 16th debate of the primary campaign. Former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. of Utah bowed out of the race on Monday morning and offered an endorsement of Mr. Romney.
The departure of Mr. Huntsman underscored the rising urgency facing Mr. Romney's rivals, who are trying to change the race's trajectory. But that did not appear to happen during the debate, which was sponsored by Fox News Channel, The Wall Street Journal and the South Carolina Republican Party. While many voters say they are open to changing their minds, Mr. Romney holds considerable advantages in South Carolina and in Florida, the next primary state.
The discussion often seemed to be directed at a Southern audience, with questions devoted to what Mr. Perry termed a ''war on religion,'' as well as race and labor relations.
In a debate that fell on Martin Luther King's Birthday, the Republicans also found themselves arguing about whether convicted felons should be able to regain the right to vote when they have completed their prison sentences and parole. The issue has long been of concern to black leaders, given the disproportionate number of African-American men who serve prison terms.
Mr. Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, said he thought they should regain voting rights under those conditions, defending a position he had taken in the Senate. Mr. Romney, after considerable pushing by Mr. Santorum, said he thought that violent felons should never regain the right to vote.
At that moment, Mr. Santorum -- who appeared to have anticipated what Mr. Romney was going to say -- responded by asking why as governor of Massachusetts he never did anything to deal with a state law that permitted felons to vote even while they were on parole.
The debate only drove home the sense that the rough-and-tumble tone of the campaign was going to continue well into the first Southern primary on Saturday and that Mr. Romney's rivals were in no mood yet to fall in line behind him. When Representative Ron Paul of Texas was asked what he thought about Mr. Huntsman's call for more intraparty civility, Mr. Paul said his only regret about his negative ads was that ''I couldn't get all the things in I wanted to say in one minute.''
But Mr. Paul seemed on the defensive when the questioning turned to national security. In a state with a heavy military presence, he drew some of the strongest negative reactions from the audience. He was booed loudly when he spoke about an American foreign policy based upon the ''golden rule'' of ''don't do to other nations what we don't want them to do to us.''
The answer was in response to a question of whether to enter Pakistan militarily if there was actionable intelligence that the Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar was there.
Mr. Romney, on the other hand, replied, ''We go anywhere they are, and we kill 'em.''
While Mr. Romney came prepared to push back against attacks that have become familiar during the long series of debates, it was clear that he also was trying to rally Republicans around his candidacy. He was particularly conciliatory, going out of his way to note his agreement with his fellow Republicans onstage.
He agreed with Mr. Perry several times, including giving him a shout-out for being an expert hunter. Referring to Mr. Gingrich's assertion that America's enemies deserve to be killed, Mr. Romney said: ''And Speaker Gingrich is right. Of course you take out our enemies, wherever they are.''
Mr. Romney, who often struggles to convey a regular-guy appeal, stumbled only when asked whether he had hunted in recent years. First he said he had hunted moose, but quickly corrected himself to say elk.
After saying he would not ''describe all of my great exploits,'' he sought to make clear that he was not a devoted gamesman. ''I'm not the great hunter,'' he said with a smile.

What if Jamie Dimon is right?
What if the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase is not just blowing smoke when he complains that the country -- and, indeed, the world -- has imposed so many new rules on the banking industry, some of them overlapping, others seeming to contradict each other, yet others whose sole purpose seems to be to weigh down the industry, that they threaten to do as much harm as good? Last summer, you'll recall, Dimon confronted Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, at a conference and asked him: ''Has anyone bothered to study the cumulative effect of these things?'' Just last week, during JPMorgan's earnings call with analysts, Dimon complained that Europe's ''regulatory policy, government policy, central bank policy -- it's not coordinated. It's making the situation worse, not better.'' 
Like most nonbankers, I've tended to roll my eyes at Dimon's continuous lamentations. Surely, given all the harm the banks did to the country, regulations aimed at preventing a repeat of the financial crisis struck me as being worth whatever cost they imposed on the industry. And, yes, I admit to a little schadenfreude as well. (To be fair to Dimon, he is not completely opposed to all the new regulations. He just comes across that way when he's in rant mode.)
What has caught me up short recently is the emergence of a new critic of the banking regulations that have been pouring forth from Washington and Europe. Her name is Karen Petrou, and she is the managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, a consulting firm that, among other things, analyzes bank regulations for clients.
Unlike many in the banking industry, Petrou is not ideologically opposed to regulation. For instance, she was a critic of the lack of regulation that allowed so many sleazy subprime mortgage originators to emerge from the precrisis ooze. Yet, now, she's worried about something different: that the hundreds of new mandates required by the Dodd-Frank law are creating a new kind of risk. She calls it ''complexity risk.'' As she put it in a speech she delivered last week in New York: ''If we don't understand the cross-cutting effects and inherent contradictions in all of the stringent standards now being written into final form, we risk doing real damage to the sound, stable and -- yes -- profitable financial industry regulators say they support and the economies sorely need.''
In a paper she wrote in November, Petrou laid out a number of examples of new regulatory proposals that were either mind-bogglingly complex or contradictory -- or both. For instance, she told me recently, bank board directors will have 184 more things they will have to acknowledge responsibility for under the latest systemic standards. ''I think boards have to be responsible for what happens at their institutions,'' she said, ''but requiring them to be on the front lines of forward-looking cash flow is ridiculous.''
She also points to a contradiction in the way the Too Big to Fail institutions are being dealt with. On the one hand, Dodd-Frank is very clear that if a big bank becomes insolvent, there can be no taxpayer bailout. It must be wound down, just like any other bank. Yet, at the same time, she says, the federal and international regulators are adding a host of special Too Big to Fail capital requirements and rules. ''They are acting as if these institutions are still too big to fail. The two thrusts are incompatible.''
Why does complexity risk matter? One reason is that the more complex the rules are, the greater the likelihood that smart bankers will find ways to game them. Another is that contradictory regulations, however well meaning, simply don't make the system safer. But the most important reason is that complexity risk is having an effect on business -- and that's not helping the still-fragile economy.
Petrou says that in her own practice she has seen deals fall through -- especially in the mortgage industry -- because nobody can figure out how the new rules will be applied. Given how badly the country needs a revived housing industry, this is nothing short of tragic.
In her paper, Petrou offers a series of solutions, revolving around simpler regulations, a reliance on market discipline and transparency. She also calls for the regulators themselves to be held accountable, something that is nowhere to be found in Dodd-Frank, despite their obvious shortcomings in the years leading to the financial crisis.
However you feel about banks -- and I know that many people harbor enormous, justifiable anger at what they did -- our economy can't function without them. And they needed to be regulated. But three years ago, overly complex securities were one of the root causes of the crisis. So why, then, do we have faith that overly complex regulations will prevent the next crisis? Sad but true: they won't.

HEADLINE: South Carolina Diarist

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Sumter, S.C.
When I started covering presidential primaries, the best part was getting to know the candidates. We journalists would ride around in vans and buses with them and get an intimate look at what it's like to endure this soul-destroying process. But the ubiquity of Web cams and tweets has ended that off-the-record culture. As the technology gets more open, the lines of political communications become more closed.
Now the best part is meeting the people who come to the rallies. It's best to get to the events an hour early and treat the waiting crowd like a cocktail party. First, you ask people about the local economy. Then you ask them about their lives (about which they are always interesting). Then you ask them about what they think of the issues and candidates (they generally repeat the banalities they have heard one of us pundits utter on TV the day before). 
This past weekend in South Carolina I met, among many others, a soldier leaving for Afghanistan who quoted the Book of Revelation from his iPhone, a Vietnam veteran who movingly described the death of his first wife, a textile factory middle manager whose job got sent to El Salvador and a pawnshop manager who supports Ron Paul and said he has clients who buy a new gun every time the government does something they don't like.
I came here wondering how voters would react to the charge that Mitt Romney was a corporate vulture when he ran the private equity firm Bain Capital. I asked dozens of people. They were all familiar with the attacks, thanks to the TV ads. Almost everybody thought the charges were ridiculous, even supporters of Newt Gingrich.
A realtor looked at me dismissively: Sometimes deals work, he said, sometimes they don't. You have to be efficient to survive. That's the way capitalism works. Romney's opponents probably would have been smarter to hit him for being a flip-flopper, not a businessman.
I was also struck, as in New Hampshire and Iowa, by the mood of this year's rallies. Republican audiences this year want a restoration. America once had strong values, they believe, but we have gone astray. We've got to go back and rediscover what we had. Heads nod enthusiastically every time a candidate touches this theme.
I agree with the sentiment, but it makes for an incredibly backward-looking campaign. I sometimes wonder if the Republican Party has become the receding roar of white America as it pines for a way of life that will never return.
The other pleasure of covering campaigns is getting to play American Idol judge, evaluating the political performances.
Mitt Romney is never going to be confused for Pericles on the stump. Every sigh and utterance is prescripted, so watching his rallies is like watching the 19,000th performance of the road show of ''Cats.'' And he has terrible reaction responses. When somebody else is talking and he means to show agreement, he mugs like someone from a bad silent movie. His wife, Ann, is much warmer and more natural on stage.
But Romney's awkwardness seems to endear him to audiences, because he's trying so hard. He spends an enormous amount of time after the speeches shaking hands, taking pictures and holding babies. Beads of sweat form on his forehead as he throws himself graciously into the crowds. He also has a nice startle response. When something unexpected happens, his face lights up and you get a burst of happy humanity out of him.
Newt Gingrich's presentations are forceful. He has a genius for pithy formulations and a consistent theme: The solutions to everything are obvious if only the idiots would get out of my way.
Ron Paul's supporters are so grateful. The world was once confusing, but then they read ''End the Fed'' and the scales fell from their eyes. Paul himself is fascinating because as some smart person observed (I've forgotten who), he thinks serially, not causally. The income tax happened and the Patriot Act happened and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, bailed out the banks and job growth stinks. Paul doesn't bother with logical links. He just strings events together and assumes causation.
I brought my 12-year-old son on this latest trip. My rule is that if a candidate can't relate well to a 12-year-old, they'll never win a general election. He approached all the candidates, and they were all wonderful except Gingrich. But that wasn't Gingrich's fault. My son, whose heroes include John Boehner and Tupac Shakur, picked an argument about gay marriage. Gingrich engaged, but after 10 seconds signaled security to brush my kid away.
Rick Perry ran a poor campaign but seems like the guy you'd most want to have a beer with. He took the time to tell my son how important it is to study hard and prepare for whatever you do.
Dad really appreciated that one.

HEADLINE: Romney and the President's Pentagon Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES, DAVID E. SANGER and NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
Mitt Romney was wrong in stating at the debate Monday night that President Obama wants to cut $1 trillion from military spending. The administration is committed to reductions of less than half that amount over 10 years -- about $450 billion, or roughly 8 percent of the Pentagon budget over a decade.
Moreover, Congressional Republicans as well as Democrats support the level of cuts that Mr. Obama is seeking. The cuts were mandated as part of the bipartisan deficit-reduction agreement with the president in August. 
That bipartisan deal does include another round of cuts in January 2013 that would be automatic, half in domestic programs and half in the military, and it would bring total military reductions to about $1 trillion over 10 years. But the administration opposes that outcome for the Pentagon. Mr. Obama's defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, has said reductions on that scale would be ruinous.
Mr. Obama has proposed alternative deficit-reduction measures to avoid the threatened automatic cuts, but Republicans oppose his plan because it calls for additional revenues from higher taxes on the wealthy as well as spending reductions in entitlement benefit programs like Medicare, farm subsidies and federal pension programs.
U.S. Military Bases
Representative Ron Paul's argument during the debate for closing American bases overseas goes to a critical question in defense strategy: In the long run, is it more or less expensive to keep troops ''forward deployed''?
It is not an easy question to answer, but it is also not as black and white as Mr. Paul made it sound. Some major allies, like Japan, pay to keep American troops on their soil. And in many cases, keeping troops abroad is considered a way to deter bad behavior -- that is why the Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, is focused on keeping the Strait of Hormuz open, despite Iranian threats.
DAVID E. SANGER
New Trade Markets
Reprising a charge he leveled against Mr. Obama in New Hampshire, Mr. Romney suggested that the president had done nothing to advance trade with other countries.
''This president has opened up no new markets for American goods around the world in his three years, even as European nations and China have opened up 44,'' Mr. Romney said.
Not true: Mr. Obama has signed three trade deals since taking office, one each with South Korea, Panama and Colombia. The South Korean pact was characterized by Bloomberg News as the largest trade deal since the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994.
Pushed by the Web site PolitiFact on the discrepancy, aides to Mr. Romney said the criticism was accurate because the deals originated in negotiations during the Bush administration, before Mr. Obama took office.
But the fact remains that all three were signed by Mr. Obama in October. As PolitiFact pointed out, all three agreements faced significant resistance from the president's own party, but ultimately passed after extensive negotiations between Mr. Obama and Congress.
NICHOLAS CONFESSORE
Creating More Jobs
Mr. Romney said that while he already has a jobs plan even though he is not ''yet'' president, Mr. Obama does not have one. That is incorrect.
Mr. Obama sent legislation to Congress in early September that called for $447 billion in temporary tax cuts and for spending initiatives that private-sector macroeconomic forecasters said would create up to 1.9 million jobs in 2012 and add up to two percentage points to the rate of economic growth. More than half of the package consisted of tax cuts, including an extension and expansion of the current two-point reduction in workers' 6.2 percent payroll tax for Social Security contributions, to 3.1 percent, and relief to employers as well.
Mr. Obama also called for financing for infrastructure projects to create jobs and subsidies to states to keep teachers and first responders employed. Republicans have blocked much of the package because Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats proposed to offset its cost with higher taxes on the wealthiest people.
Congress and Mr. Obama agreed in December to a two-month extension of employee payroll tax relief and are negotiating for a full-year extension, but the partisan split over how to pay for the tax cut remains.

HEADLINE: Military Drill With the U.S. Is Postponed, Israeli Says

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Israel and the United States have agreed to postpone major joint missile-defense exercises that had been scheduled for the spring because of regional tensions and instability, according to Israel's foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman. 
The move appears intended to avoid further escalating tensions with Iran, which is under intense international diplomatic and economic pressure to curb its nuclear program out of fears that it is seeking to make a nuclear bomb. Iran itself recently held 10 days of naval exercises near the Strait of Hormuz, and Israel has kept open the possibility of a military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities.
At the same time, the United States is leading an effort to increase sanctions on Iran, and an Iranian nuclear scientist was assassinated in Tehran, the fourth such attack reported in two years. Iran blames the United States and Israel for the killings.
Speaking Monday on Israel Radio, Mr. Lieberman cited ''diplomatic and regional reasons, the tensions and instability'' as factors in delaying the exercise. The Israeli military said in a statement that the joint exercise, Austere Challenge 12, would take place during the second half of the year.
The exercises, involving thousands of American and Israeli soldiers, were designed to test various Israeli and American air defense systems against missiles and rockets from a range that would include Iran, The Associated Press reported.
The American defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, said last month that the drill exemplified unprecedented levels of military cooperation between the two countries and that it was meant to back up Washington's ''unshakable'' commitment to Israel's security, The A.P. said.
Mark Regev, a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel and the United States made the decision to delay the exercise ''because it was not the right time.'' He did not elaborate.
Israeli officials have saluted the effectiveness of existing sanctions against Iran while also urging more, specifically on Iran's Central Bank and its petrochemical sector.
In an interview published Saturday in The Weekend Australian, Mr. Netanyahu said he was seeing Iran ''wobble'' for the first time. ''If these sanctions are coupled with a clear statement by the international community, led by the U.S., to act militarily to stop Iran if sanctions fail,'' he said, ''Iran may consider not going through the pain.''
On Sunday, Moshe Yaalon, a vice prime minister and minister of strategic affairs, described the Obama administration's failure to add more sanctions as ''a disappointment so far.''
''The administration is hesitating because of fears of rising oil prices this year, apparently out of election year considerations,'' he told Israel Radio.
On Monday, Mr. Netanyahu told a closed meeting of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that sanctions on Iran had to be increased and implemented expeditiously and aggressively, according to a participant in the meeting.

HEADLINE: Britain Seeks More Renminbi Trading in London

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- Britain plans to turn London into a major foreign exchange trading center for the Chinese renminbi to benefit from faster growth in Asia while strengthening the city's position as a financial center in the wake of the banking crisis. 
George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said during a visit to Hong Kong on Monday that he was working with Chinese and British banks to establish London as a new hub for the renminbi market.
''London is perfectly placed to act as a gateway for Asian banking and investment in Europe, and a bridge to the United States,'' Mr. Osborne said in a speech to the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong. ''This is not just an accident of time zone, or our language, although both are important. It reflects London's strength in product development, its regulatory structure, and the depth, breadth and international reach of its financial markets.''
The pledge comes as Britain is increasingly feeling the effects of an economic slowdown across Europe, and some British banks have threatened to move their headquarters abroad in light of stricter financial regulation.
The government hopes that steps toward creating a Chinese currency hub in London will help strengthen the city's role as a financial center vis-a-vis New York and Hong Kong, while helping Britain attract Chinese investments in other sectors, including infrastructure.
Mr. Osborne said London was already the largest foreign exchange market in the world, adding that the growing use of the renminbi would ''bring substantial benefit to Chinese economic development and the wider world economy.''
The Chinese currency's share of the global foreign exchange market was 0.9 percent in June last year, Mr. Osborne said. That compares with China's share in worldwide trade of 11 percent in 2010. ''It is clear that there is scope for substantial expansion of the renminbi market in the coming years,'' Mr. Osborne said.
Sebastien Galy, a foreign exchange strategist at Societe Generale in London, agreed with Mr. Osborne that London's geographical position allowed it to play a role in the expansion of the currency market, but he said it would take time for that market to grow to a sizable volume.
''It could take decades to achieve that, which doesn't mean that the renminbi wouldn't increase in trading volumes in the meantime,'' Mr. Galy said. ''There are regional issues, their markets are not developed enough yet and also you need a floating currency.''
In a first step to expand the currency trading, Hong Kong has decided to expand the operating hours of its renminbi settlement system by five hours. China has been using its currency more in international trade to reduce its reliance on the dollar.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Development Test in Adirondack Park

BYLINE: By DAVID GIBSON and DAN PLUMLEY. 
The authors are partners with Adirondack Wild: Friends of the Forest Preserve, a membership-supported, nonprofit organization. They have worked for the protection of the Adirondack Park since 1987.

 BODY:
Ballston Lake, N.Y.
''THE Adirondacks are preserved forever,'' Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller famously boasted after passage of the Adirondack Park Agency (A.P.A.) Land Use law of 1973. The A.P.A. law calls for precious natural resources of the park to be preserved and development of its private lands carefully planned to ensure compatibility with the adjacent, publicly owned Forest Preserve, which our state constitution says must be ''forever wild.''
Of course, nothing is preserved forever. Protective laws are not self-executing and require spirited people to apply and renew them. Rockefeller's agency did stand up for the law in the 1970s when massive second-home subdivisions with names like Horizon and Ton-Da-Lay planned for remote forests were stopped. In the late 1980s, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's A.P.A. prevented Patten Corporation from exploiting this magnificent mountain landscape -- which is larger than the state of Massachusetts and larger than Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Glacier and Olympic national parks combined -- to make a fast buck. 
Now comes a serious test for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. He, like his predecessors, says the park is a treasure that must be protected. His A.P.A. (the governor names the agency's chair, and all of its members are either gubernatorial nominations, requiring senate confirmation, or state agency appointments) has been handed the hearing record on the sprawling Adirondack Club and Resort, the largest second-home subdivision application that the A.P.A. has seen in 35 years. During the agency's January meeting, this Wednesday through Friday in Ray Brook, N.Y., the A.P.A. will decide whether to permit 706 residential units, 332 buildings and 15 miles of new roads, sewer, water and electrical lines spread over 6,235 forested acres with sensitive streams, ponds and wetlands on rugged terrain several miles from Tupper Lake -- in the very heart of the Adirondack Park.
If permitted, the project would stand the 39-year-old A.P.A. law on its head and establish a dangerous precedent for the park's fragile, remote backcountry. More than three-quarters of the project site lies within Resource Management -- under the law, the park's most protected private land zone -- the legislative purpose of which is to ''protect the delicate physical and biological resources ... and preserve the open spaces that are essential and basic to the unique character of the park.''
This project would spread 82 large second homes, including 39 so-called great camps, throughout this zone, with a serious impact on sensitive habitats and wildlife, essentially replacing local hunters and foresters with private driveways and ''No Trespassing'' signs. A respected conservation biologist, Dr. Michael Klemens, testified at the public hearing last April that ''the club and resort is classic sprawl on steroids.
''It spreads negative ecological impacts out across the landscape,'' he continued. ''It is a train wreck resulting from a process that does not allow for understanding natural systems in the first place.'' A smarter alternative, he said, would develop a complete understanding of the project site and only then plan houses in a more compact design that avoids sensitive areas.
In exchange for risking such damage to the Adirondacks, some might expect a tremendous economic return. Yet the applicants have no track record developing land or selling lots inside the Adirondack Park. Nor do they have the money to construct the project on their own. The county Industrial Development Agency is being asked for $36 million in private revenue bonds to fund the infrastructure.
During the hearing, the applicant's marketing and fiscal studies were shown to be incomplete, insubstantial and misleading. Evidence suggested that the resort's inflated sales projections are founded largely upon the speculative dreams of the applicant. One impartial expert in resort development, David Norden, said during the hearing last June that the market for such a remote project ''is very limited ... and as such the project carries a relatively high risk profile.
''This project does not possess the primary characteristics of resorts most likely to succeed as we come out of the recession,'' he added. With sales likely to fall well below projections, tax revenues will also fall well below the mark, Mr. Norden and other experts maintained. Major investments in Big Tupper Ski Area, the most broadly supported aspect of the project, are delayed to its latter phases.
Other experts testified that if real estate sales are slow and the project stalls, local residents could be stuck with the operation and maintenance of miles of new roads and sewer lines leading to only a few new homes. Furthermore, the resort's owners won't pay taxes directly to the town or school district; they will make payments in lieu of taxes to private bondholders willing to invest in this risky enterprise. The taxing districts will get what's left over after these payments are made.
Since 1892, Adirondack Park has been not only of state and regional importance but also of great national and international significance. The park inspired the national wilderness system and is designated an International Biosphere Reserve. Standards for building on this scale in the park should be as high as its mountains, and the law says they must be. The Adirondack Club and Resort sets a glaringly low standard, and the A.P.A. should deny it. Only then might we see an alternative that actually makes sense for the park's environment and marketplace and that concentrates redevelopment where it was intended -- around Big Tupper Ski Area.
Will Governor Cuomo, like his father and Nelson Rockefeller, insist that the A.P.A. abide by its law? Or will he risk damaging a park beloved by millions and globally regarded as a model for sustaining people and wild nature?

HEADLINE: A Life Hidden Behind Adjectives

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
THE REAL ROMNEY
By Michael Kranish and Scott Helman
Illustrated. 401 pages. Harper. $27.99.
The cloud of adjectives that has come to hover over the Republican candidate Mitt Romney in news reports is familiar by now: smooth, smart, slick; detached, disciplined, dogged; pragmatic, protean, phony; careful, cautious, calculating.
Journalists have described him as robotic (not unlike Al Gore), father-haunted (not unlike George W. Bush), disdainful of hands-on politicking (not unlike Barack Obama) and capable of complete flip-flops on hot-button issues (not unlike Newt Gingrich). He has been hailed for his analytic business skills as a turnaround specialist, and assailed as a job-killing vulture capitalist; lauded for his skill in getting health-care legislation passed in Massachusetts, and criticized by both the left and right for subsequently trying to distance himself from that achievement.
A new biography, ''The Real Romney,'' by two reporters from The Boston Globe, Michael Kranish and Scott Helman, won't substantially alter such perceptions of the candidate. The book retraces ground familiar to anyone who has been following coverage of the Republican nomination race, but it pulls together lots of details into a narrative that's absorbing and fair-minded. 
Drawing on the collective expertise of The Globe's staff in covering Mr. Romney's tenure as Massachusetts governor and his lucrative career at the private-equity firm Bain Capital, the book judiciously assesses his evolving views (or, in some cases, outright reversals) on an array of social issues, while trying to evaluate assertions he's made on the campaign trail and in two books.
Mr. Helman and Mr. Kranish conclude, for instance, that it's impossible to independently verify Mr. Romney's claim that he helped create a ''net, net'' of tens of thousands of jobs (a claim ratified by Bain Capital officials in 2011, say the authors, though without documentation) ''with anything approaching certainty.'' After all, they reason:
''Many companies that Romney held briefly were in private hands and changed owners numerous times. They were saddled with debt, restructured, and split up. Some companies under Romney's control prospered, and some failed; some produced new jobs, and others shut down and left people out of work.''
As for the prominent role the Romney family has played in Mormon history, the book's authors say this is little known outside the church because ''Mitt rarely talked about the special legacy of his ancestors.'' When he did, he often offered a truncated version: his book ''Turnaround,'' Mr. Kranish and Mr. Helman write, recounted the story of his great-grandfather Miles's dramatic journey to Mexico in the 1880s, ''but left out most of the details, with no mention of Miles's multiple wives or his perilous assignment to create a sanctuary for polygamy across the border.''
Perhaps the most useful portions of ''The Real Romney'' deconstruct his management style as a Bain executive and governor of Massachusetts, providing clues as to how he might govern as president. Also instructive are the detailed accounts of Mr. Romney's unsuccessful effort to unseat Senator Edward M. Kennedy in 1994 and his unsuccessful effort to win the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 -- accounts that shed some light on his chameleonlike political stands and his current travails in the primary process.
Mr. Kranish and Mr. Helman note that from the start of Mr. Romney's foray into politics, the question of identity -- ''What were his issues? What did he believe?'' -- was central. They write that in his campaign against Senator Kennedy: ''Some of his positions seemed to be calibrated for voter approval, not necessarily reflective of personal convictions. Strategy trumped ideology: what kind of candidate did he need to be to win?''
Mindful of Kennedy's legacy as a defender of civil rights and William Weld's ascent to the Massachusetts governorship as a socially liberal Republican, the authors argue, Mr. Romney's Senate campaign tried to ''present him as an acceptable choice on social issues to independents, wayward Democrats, and especially women.'' Mr. Romney, the authors report, did not join the Republican Party until October 1993, had previously given money to Democratic Congressional candidates and ''voted for Paul Tsongas, the iconoclastic liberal, in the 1992 Democratic primary.''
Early in the Senate race, they write, Mr. Romney ''established himself as a passionate supporter of abortion rights,'' despite his personal opposition to abortion, and ''his professed views would grow more liberal over the course of the race.'' They report that he endorsed the legalization of RU-486, the abortion-inducing drug, and appeared at a fund-raiser for Planned Parenthood.
Mr. Romney would later explain, however, that a November 2004 meeting with a Harvard University stem-cell researcher triggered ''an awakening on 'life' issues.'' He began calling himself ''firmly prolife'' and, according to Mr. Kranish and Mr. Helman, he made ''a series of shifts'' as his gubernatorial term went on -- ''in some cases wholesale reversals of past positions, in others significant changes in emphasis'' -- on other issues as well. These included abstinence-only sex education, a plan to reduce greenhouse gases, and gay rights.
Disgruntled constituents saw this recalibration as a sign that Mr. Romney ''had set his sights on a bigger prize than Massachusetts,'' the authors write. ''Some were furious at his reversals on issues that were personally important to them. Others felt his presidential ambitions had clouded his judgment about what was best for Massachusetts.''
Several advisers warned that Mr. Romney's efforts to cast himself as a true social conservative would backfire and that he should focus on his economic message in the 2008 presidential nomination race. Instead, Mr. Kranish and Mr. Helman write, the campaign embraced a strategy that relied heavily on the idea that Senator John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani ''would fight for the more moderate voters within the G.O.P. primaries and caucuses, leaving Romney room to court the right.''
The governor's abrupt ''rebirth as a social conservative'' not only stood in marked contrast to his earlier career but also to that of his father, George Romney. A chairman of American Motors who became governor of Michigan, the elder Romney was an idealistic moderate, walking out of the 1964 Republican National Convention over the party's foot-dragging on civil rights.
''If George Romney shot from the hip,'' the authors of this book write, ''his son, before he shoots at all, carefully studies the target, lines up the barrel just right, and might even fire a few practice rounds. Mitt Romney, who saw the shortcomings of his father's approach, has often been more inclined to identify the consequences he wants, then figure out how to get there.''
Family members were acquainted with Mitt's ''zany side,'' Mr. Kranish and Mr. Helman write, and a fellow church member even described him getting up at a meeting and delivering a credible rendering of Michael Jackson's ''Billie Jean,'' complete with moonwalking. But with outsiders, he tended to be so formal that one business partner dubbed him ''the Tin Man'' for his inability to bond emotionally -- not a temperament exactly suited for the contact sport that is politics.
What were the origins of this detachment? Mr. Kranish and Mr. Helman quote his sister Jane, suggesting that an incident in which their father helped torpedo his own success as a presidential candidate in 1967 with a single remark -- he blurted out in a television interview that he'd been subjected to ''the greatest brainwashing'' by the generals and the diplomatic corps in Vietnam -- had a lasting impact on her brother.
''Mitt is naturally a diplomat, but I think that made him more so,'' she is quoted as saying. ''He's not going to put himself out on a limb. He's more cautious, more scripted.''
Business school and law school -- he got a double degree at Harvard in 1975 -- would hone Mr. Romney's analytic bent, as would his years at Bain and his experience turning around the troubled 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. Whether he was ''expanding the boundaries of private equity or enacting a novel universal health care plan'' in Massachusetts, the authors of this book say, ''he followed a trusty formula: pursue data aggressively, analyze rigorously, test constantly, and observe always.''
''Having grown up around engines, Romney adopted a kind of car hobbyist's mind-set,'' they write. ''Almost anything, he believed, could be taken apart, studied, and re-engineered.''
After the collapse of his 2008 presidential bid, Mr. Romney talked through the failure with his advisers, crunching the numbers and evaluating what went wrong. He concluded, say Mr. Helman and Mr. Kranish, that ''he had failed to get across what he was really all about,'' that ''he had lacked definition.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Jobs Record, Up for Twitter Debate

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
It did not even take the full 140-characters to start the great Twitter war Monday afternoon.
In fact, it started innocently enough, just after noon, with a Twitter posting from @MittRomney, the Mitt Romney Twitter account. 
@MittRomney Mitt Romney
More Americans have lost their jobs under @BarackObama than any president in modern history. http://t.co/CyCSpY9M
Mon Jan 16 17:27:13 via Mitt Romney
A few hours later, David Axelrod, the longtime strategist for President Obama, offered up a reply to Mr. Romney.
@davidaxelrod David Axelrod
. @MittRomney A picture's worth a thousand misleading words. This chart tells the story.http://bit.ly/z4V0Us
Mon Jan 16 20:19:30 via David Axelrod
Mr. Axelrod included a link to a graph on the Obama campaign's Web site, which cited the Bureau of Labor Statistics to show 22 consecutive months of job growth.
Fifteen minutes later, Eric Fehrnstrom, a top adviser to Mr. Romney, replied to Mr. Axelrod, with a posting that hit back.
@EricFehrn Eric Fehrnstrom
.@davidaxelrod Sometimes you don't need a picture to tell a story. The numbers speak for themselves - 1.7 million jobs lost under Obama.
Mon Jan 16 20:36:48 via Eric Fehrnstrom
And then the two men were off, going back and forth in some 140-character rapid-fire debate day trash-talking that finally wound down nearly a dozen Twitter posts and more than two hours later, after Mr. Axelrod referred to Mr. Fehrnstrom as ''Dude.''
@davidaxelrod David Axelrod
@EricFehrn Dude, none of my business, but shouldn't you be in debate prep instead of trying to explain yourself to me?
Mon Jan 16 22:51:45 via David Axelrod
Mr. Fehrnstrom's reply:
@EricFehrn Eric Fehrnstrom
@davidaxelrod Haha! Believe it or not, the economy is an issue where we don't prep Mitt, he preps us.
Mon Jan 16 22:55:47 via Eric Fehrnstrom
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve as a Hedge Fund: Higher Profits, Lower Pay

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Reserve is operating like a hedge fund, leveraging its balance sheet to earn huge profits. Yet the federal employees who manage this operation receive a relative pittance. 

 BODY:
The year 2011 is over, and soon we'll be hearing again about billion-dollar paydays for select hedge fund wizards.
If it makes you feel any better, not everyone is sharing in these riches. The people who operate the most successful hedge fund around are receiving a relative pittance.
That hedge fund is the Federal Reserve. Last year, the central bank turned over $76.9 billion in profit to the federal government, slightly down from $79.3 billion it provided in 2010.
The Fed made this money in interest on a nearly $3 trillion portfolio of securities. This enormous holding was built up largely in the wake of the financial crisis as the Fed bought these securities through two rounds of quantitative easing.
I call the Fed a hedge fund because it is operating like one, leveraging its balance sheet to earn huge profits. The main difference between a hedge fund and the Fed is that the Fed effectively creates its own money, so it doesn't have any borrowing costs, meaning yet more profits. Remarkably, the Fed's profits are also an afterthought. The Fed is trying to stabilize and increase the United States economy in the wake of the financial crisis, and its profits are a nice byproduct.
Still, these earnings blow away any other hedge fund profits.
The Fed employees who manage this operation receive a federal salary for their efforts. The money is well above the pay of the average American but still relatively modest compared with those in the financial industry. The top salary class at the Federal Reserve has a maximum of $205,570 a year. Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, earns $199,700 a year, while the other members of the Federal Reserve board earn $179,700.
Officers of the branch banks of the Federal Reserve system earn more. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner's old position, receives $410,780. By my calculation, the 17,015 employees of the Federal Reserve received an average compensation of $87,579 in 2010.
Figures for 2011 hedge fund compensation are yet to be known, but compare the Fed's salaries with the highest paid hedge fund managers in 2010. According to AR: Absolute Return + Alpha magazine's annual list, the top 25 hedge fund managers made $22 billion, or an average of $880 million. The highest paid hedge fund manager in 2010 was John Paulson, who made $4.9 billion running a hedge fund that had about $33 billion in assets. (He is likely to make much less in 2011, with his funds falling as much as 52.5 percent last year.)
Hedge fund managers make their money from the "2 and 20." Hedge funds generally charge a fee of roughly 1 to 2 percent on all assets under administration and take 20 percent of the profits. The idea is that this large cut will incentivize the hedge fund manager to earn outsize profits.
But federal employees who were paid astoundingly less made fantastically higher profits than any single hedge fund manager. The entire Fed payroll for 2010 was still less than Mr. Paulson's 2010 salary. One man made four times more than the Fed's 17,000 plus employees combined, and earned much less money.
The point is not that the federal government should go into the hedge fund business or that making money is relatively easy for the Fed. Rather, it is that these government employees did this service without demanding to be paid billions in compensation.
They are not alone. Treasury Department employees take on the similarly complicated, hedge fund-type task of supervising the economy for even lower pay than the Fed's employees.
Even outside the federal government, there are those who are not paid enormous sums to perform the most complicated financial tasks.
David F. Swensen, the chief of the Yale endowment, for example, is one of the most successful asset managers in recent history, consistently earning outsize returns and often beating the best hedge fund performers. His salary too is much less than that of the hedge fund barons. In the last few years, his salary has ranged from $3 million to $5 million a year for managing Yale's endowment, which is valued at about $20 billion.
Even so, people in private industry argue that you have to pay top dollar to get the best people and that the market demands it.
We even see this argument being made by the federal government. The regulator who oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Edward J. DeMarco, has asserted that he had to pay the top six executives at Fannie and Freddie more than $35 million in combined pay over 2009 and 2010. He said that to do otherwise would be "irresponsible" because it would fail to retain and attract the appropriate people. Yet, the Fannie and Freddie executives are arguably doing even less sophisticated work than the Federal Reserve employees do.
Why these executives should be paid more than Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues defies reason. This is government work now.
These disparities show that compensation, like people, is a complicated issue. People are willing to forgo earnings for prestige and other benefits like job security. And perhaps top dollar simply does not need to be as high as those in the finance industry would want you to believe.
Perhaps more interesting, the Fed pay structure may show that the work that these hedge fund barons and other titans of finance and industry perform doesn't require multimillion-dollar salaries - even when some claim that the market demands them. Perhaps they would be willing to accept lower amounts when push comes to shove.
This will happen only when the pension funds and other institutional investors recognize that a 20 percent cut of the profits paid to hedge fund managers is too much, and they push hard to lower these fees. In the private equity realm, the Institutional Limited Partners Association is leading a similar crusade, but no such movement has yet penetrated the hedge fund universe.
The Fed has unwillingly made billions, to the benefit of the United States taxpayer. The Fed and its employees have done it in a way that would make even the most ardent opponent of the Fed proud - at a low cost.

HEADLINE: Your Money's Worth: Examining Facts and Attitudes About Income Inequality

BYLINE: SARAH KAVANAGH and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Examining charts, graphs and interactive infographics with data about income disparity, and analyzing the data to make claims about American society. 

 BODY:
Overview | What does income inequality say about contemporary American society? What should be done to address income inequality? In this lesson, students examine Times infographics about income and wealth distribution in the United States and discuss what this information says about society. 
Materials | Copies of the Socioeconomic Class Survey (one per student), computers with Internet access (one per pair), projector.
Warm-Up | Have students independently complete the Socioeconomic Class Survey, which includes questions taken from a recent Pew Research Center survey study on whether Americans perceive there to be conflicts between social groups and whether Americans believe that wealth is generally earned or inherited. You might allow students to keep their responses private; you might also collect them and report how many students chose each option. 
Then show the class the graphic "Tensions Between the Rich and Poor," a visual representation of how Americans responded to the questions about class tensions. Ask students what they notice. How have responses to these questions changed over time? What do they think might account for those changes? Are they surprised by these responses? How do their own responses differ from those of Americans more broadly? What might account for the differences? Before moving on, be sure to discuss why students think there might be a growing sense that there is conflict between rich people and poor people in the United States. 
Related | Paul Krugman's column "How Fares the Dream?" examines income inequality in the United States:
If King could see America now, I believe that he would be disappointed, and feel that his work was nowhere near done. He dreamed of a nation in which his children "will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character." But what we actually became is a nation that judges people not by the color of their skin - or at least not as much as in the past - but by the size of their paychecks. And in America, more than in most other wealthy nations, the size of your paycheck is strongly correlated with the size of your father's paycheck.
Read the entire article with your class, using the questions below.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension: 

        
In what ways does Mr. Krugman believe that America has made progress since Dr. King delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech?
        
Why does Mr. Krugman believe that Dr. King would be disappointed in America today? Do you agree or disagree?
        
What does Mr. Krugman mean when he says that "there are racial implications to the ways that our incomes have been pulling apart"?
        
What phenomenon happened around 1980 that Mr. Krugman describes using the metaphor of a ladder?
        
Do you agree or disagree with Mr. Krugman that income inequality should be discussed loudly and openly in American society? 
Activity | Inform students that they will be working in pairs to explore more data about income and wealth distribution in the United States. Each pair's job will be to reflect on what they have learned by making a claim about contemporary American society and supporting that claim using evidence from the infographics. Pairs will then present their claims and evidence to their classmates and discuss what wealth and income distribution in the United States says about contemporary American society.
Give each pair one of the following graphics to explore (assign multiple pairs to look at the same graphic as needed):
The Top 1 Percent: What Jobs Do They Have?
What Percent are You?
Where the 1 Percent Fit in the Hierarchy of Income
Lower Taxes for the Highest Earners
Comparing Economic Mobility
Inflation-Adjusted Change in Median Earnings for American Men, 1969-2009
Share of Total U.S. Income Going to Each Income Percentile and Distribution of Wealth by Class, 1983-2009
A Closer Look at Income Mobility (from 2005)
Provide pairs with these prompts to respond to:

        
Describe the information that is visually represented in this chart, graph or infographic.
        
How might you explain or interpret this information?
        
What, if anything, is surprising to you about this information and why? 
        
What does the information in the infographic make you think? 
When this work is complete, they will work together to complete this sentence: "Today, America is " and then select five pieces of data from the infographics they just examined to support the claim they make in their sentence about contemporary American society. Have them write their sentence and pieces of supporting evidence on a large sheet of paper. 
Have each group share their graphics and explain them to the class. Then have the pairs post their claims around the room, and read aloud and examine all of the claims as a class.
Finally, note that class began with a discussion of why it might be that a majority of Americans feel there is conflict between rich and poor. What have you learned today that might help you answer that question? What struck you as you listened to your peers' interpretations of the infographics? What questions do you have leaving class today? 
Going Further | Students read the dialogue between Times readers on how to spark economic mobility and equality in today's America. They then write a contribution to that dialogue that describes their own ideas about how to reinvigorate economic mobility in contemporary American society and post it to the comments section of this lesson.
Standards | This lesson is correlated to McREL's national standards (it can also be aligned to the new Common Core State Standards):

HIGHLIGHT: On Tuesday, a San Diego company plans to announce $17 million in new financing to continue its work on raising the fuel yields from jatropha, a tropical shrub that produces an oil-rich nut. 

 BODY:
The use of jet fuel from renewable sources is now well demonstrated, but it costs more than double what fuel made from petroleum does, according to airlines, aircraft companies and suppliers. One way to cut the cost may be to tinker with the plants that biofuel is made from. 
Take jatropha, for example. Lufthansa said last week that it had completed a series of more than 800 flights by an Airbus A321 that shuttled between Hamburg and Frankfurt while burning a 50 percent biofuel mix in one of its two engines. The biofuel was derived partly from jatropha, a tropical shrub with an oil-rich nut, and it cost about two and a half times what ordinary petroleum-based fuel does.
On Monday, the United States secretary of agriculture, Thomas Vilsack, speaking at Boeing's headquarters in Chicago, identified a major impediment to the biofuels endeavor: the cost of harvesting and delivering the feedstock for biorefineries, the factories that make fuel from plant material.
Biologists and financiers are focusing on the problem. On Tuesday, a San Diego company, SG Biofuels, plans to announce $17 million in new financing from venture capital sources to continue its work on raising the yields from jatropha.

The company is trying to do for jatropha, whose fruit is inedible, what agronomists have done for food crops like wheat and corn, swapping genes among strains to produce varieties that are hardy and higher-yielding. The company said it had already raised yields of jatropha oil to 250 to 350 gallons per acre, double the normal output. 
 "Mother nature gave us a good foundation,'' said Kirk Haney, the company's chief executive. "But there is a lot of opportunity to push this plant to even higher yields." 
 Jatropha is sometimes used to make hedges for containing cattle. Specialists say it was spread around the tropics by Portuguese sailors who believed it had medicinal properties. SG Biofuels has gone back to Central America, where the plant originated, to seek out more strains with favorable characteristics for genetic manipulation. 
The plant produces a fruit the size of a golf ball with three black seeds, each about the size of an almond. The hulls of the seeds are burned for energy, and the seeds are then crushed to yield a triglyceride, an oil that can be converted at a refinery to diesel fuel or jet fuel. 
 Lufthansa used a mixture of jatropha and camelina, which is widely grown in the United States, and animal fats. After six months on the 50-50 blend, the engine appeared to be functioning normally, the airline said. The goal was to get an idea what the engine would look like after years of service on a lower blend.
(The fuel is blended because its energy content is slightly lower per unit volume than ordinary jet fuel is. It is somewhat comparable to the way that ethanol has a lower energy content than gasoline; if the energy content were allowed to get too low, cockpit instruments would have to be adjusted. But unlike ethanol, jet fuel from jatropha is a "drop-in" substitute, requiring no special distribution system or adjustments to the engines.)
Carbon dioxide emissions declined about 60 percent, gallon for gallon, with the biofuel, Lufthansa said, while noting the 2.5-times increase in cost.
Some airlines have reported an even higher differential.
Of the cost, 80 to 85 percent involves the feedstock, according to Lufthansa and Boeing, which worked with the airline on its test program. The project also included a flight by a Boeing 747 from Frankfurt to Washington last week, with the 50-50 blend loaded into the tanks feeding the two engines on the right wing. 
Obviously, the cost has to come down: Lufthansa said it spent $8.4 million on the six-month test, with the European Union paying about one-third of the expense. 
In a panel discussion in Chicago on Monday, Billy Glover, Boeing's vice president for environment in its commercial airplane sector, said the company hoped to stabilize its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by using more efficient planes and more biofuels, while still allowing air travel to grow. By 2050, he said, the industry's goal is to reduce emissions by 50 percent. 
(In theory, the Obama administration's goal is to cut American greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by that date, although the economy is not on track to accomplish that.) 
Mr. Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, has been traveling the country preaching the virtues of fueling airplanes from farms. He said that his department would help establish eight to 10 biorefineries producing both vehicle fuel and aviation fuel. 
The feedstocks will be specific to the region where the refineries were built -- in some places, the nonfood parts of the corn plant, and in others, algae or switchgrass, he said. The department will subsidize the price of feedstocks to help bring the cost closer to competitive levels for the airlines, he said. The Navy has been lined up as a customer. 
But, as with gasoline and diesel from nonfood biomass, the effort has not fully taken off. "We're just now getting to point where we're going to be producing this,'' Mr. Vilsack said.

HEADLINE: Newt Gingrich and the Art of Racial Politics

BYLINE: CHARLES M. BLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Juan Williams and Newt Gingrich have a telling exchange. 

 BODY:
That's the way I like to spend my Martin Luther King, Jr. Day: watching Newt Gingrich sneer at Juan Williams, a black man, for having the temerity to ask him if his condescending remarks about the work ethic of poor black people are indeed condescending:
Juan Williams: Speaker Gingrich, you recently said black Americans should demand jobs, not food stamps. You also say poor kids lack a strong work ethic and proposed having them work as janitors in their schools. Can't you see that this is viewed as at a minimum as insulting to all Americans but particularly to black Americans?
Newt Gingrich: No, I don't see that (applause).
Gingrich went on to say that the children would be "getting money, which is a good thing if you're poor. Only the elites despise earning money."
The first implication here is that elites are liberals, not men like Gingrich - whose net worth The Los Angeles Times has estimated to be $6.7 million, who was a history professor, who was paid $1.6 million dollars by Freddie Mac for "advice," and who had a half million dollar line of credit at Tiffany's.
If Gingrich isn't among America's elite, the word no longer has meaning.
The second implication about those "elite" liberals, like President Obama, is even more explicit. Gingrich said it outright earlier in the evening when responding to a question about how long former workers should be allowed to collect unemployment benefits:
It tells you everything you need to know about the difference between Barack Obama and the five of us: that we actually think work is good (applause). We actually think saying to somebody "I'll help you if you're willing to help yourself" is good (applause). And we think unconditionally efforts by the best food stamp president in American history to maximize dependency is terrible for the future of this country (applause).
The phrase "maximize dependency" is a particularly interesting one because it suggests a systematic, orchestrated campaign by the president and liberals in general to keep blacks poor and dependent on "big government" as a way of insuring their continued political support. This is a classic, right-wing, race-based argument in a new suit.
But Williams wasn't finished. He came back at Gingrich:
Williams: Speaker Gingrich, the suggestion you made was about a lack of work ethic, and I've got to tell you that my e-mail account and twitter account has been inundated with people of all races who are asking if your comments are not intended to belittle the poor and racial minorities. We saw some of this reaction during your visit to a black church in South Carolina.
(Boos from the crowd drown Williams out as Gingrich smirks. When the boos subside, Williams continues.)
You saw some of this during your visit to a black church in South Carolina where a woman asked you why you refer to President Obama as "the food stamp president." It sounds as if you're seeking to belittle people.
(More boos from the crowd.)
Gingrich: Well, first of all, Juan -
(Crowd giggles. Talk about belittling people. "Juan.")
The fact is that more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history (applause). Now, I know among the politically correct you are not supposed to use facts that are uncomfortable (more applause and laughter).
Gingrich went on to say that he was going to continue to "find ways to help poor people learn how to get a job, learn how to get a better job, and learn someday to own the job." (Roaring applause. As if poor people don't work. As I've pointed out before, most of them do.)
These exchanges, and the audience's response to them, underscore how Republicans' gut reactions and their official rhetoric diverge, particularly in the south.
They also underscore the fact that a clever politician like Gingrich, who understands this cleavage and knows how to exploit it in subtle and sophisticated ways, still has a chance to cause Mitt Romney some headaches on his presumptive march to the nomination.
Gingrich seems to understand the historical weight of the view among some southern whites, many of whom have migrated to the Republican party, that blacks are lazy and addicted to handouts. He is able to give voice to those feelings without using those words. He is able to make people believe that a fundamentally flawed and prejudicial argument that demeans minorities is actually for their uplift. It is Gingrich's gift: He is able to make ill will sound like good will.

HEADLINE: Citigroup Profit and Revenue Decline for Quarter

BYLINE: NELSON SCHWARTZ


HIGHLIGHT: Citi shares fall more than 7 percent as the fourth-quarter results disappoint. The capital markets unit, which includes helping companies raise money and make deals, was especially weak 

 BODY:
3:30 p.m. | Updated 
Despite signs of life on Main Street, Wall Street is still struggling.
That dichotomy was evident on Tuesday, when Citigroup reported fourth-quarter results that fell far short of what analysts were forecasting, despite a pickup in lending and a drop in losses on bad loans. The culprit was the banking giant's capital markets business, where revenue fell 10 percent last quarter as market players headed for the sidelines and trading volumes dwindled.
Investors wasted little time in showing their disappointment - even as the market rallied Tuesday, Citigroup's shares were off more than 7 percent at $28.36 in afternoon trading.
More than anything else, Citigroup executive said fears about the European debt crisis made clients increasingly risk-averse during the quarter, which concluded with a "very, very weak December," according to John Gerspach, the bank's chief financial officer.
"Europe remains the largest overhang on the market at this time," he added. "There are a lot of dark clouds."
Overall, earnings dropped 11 percent to $1.16 billion, or 38 cents per share, well below the 50 cents per share Wall Street was looking for, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenues were also weak, falling 7 percent to $17.2 billion. 
Results in the year-ago period, when Citigroup posted profit of $1.3 billion, or 43 cents a share, had been helped by sizable accounting gains on the value of Citigroup debt, which were mostly absent from the fourth-quarter results for 2011.
Like other battered financial names, including Bank of America, Citigroup's shares have been surging recently on hopes that the financial crisis in Europe might be easing and the economic recovery in the United States is gaining steam. Since the end of November, Citigroup shares have rallied 20 percent.
For the full year, Citigroup reported net income of $11.3 billion, up 6 percent from 2010, one measure of progress in the company's slow but steady recovery under its chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, who has been trying to transform Citi from a sprawling but shaky global banking giant into a stronger, more nimble corporate lender.
In the wake of the financial crisis, Citigroup required a $45 billion bailout from Washington, and while that has been paid back, Mr. Pandit is still in the process of shedding assets and lightening the bank's balance sheet.
Echoing the wary stance of investors, Mr. Pandit sounded a note of caution Tuesday. "The current environment is certainly challenging," he said in a letter to employees. "We've shown that we can weather a tough environment without investors, regulators and other observers questioning our safety and soundness."
"However, the weak global economy negatively affected market activity, and many of our clients reduced their risk, especially in the fourth quarter," he said.
 Within the capital markets businesses, bond trading was especially weak. Total securities and banking revenue dropped 10 percent to $3.19 billion, but in fixed income, revenue totaled $1.6 billion, a 60 percent drop from the same period in 2010. Investment banking results also suffered, falling 45 percent to $638 million.
Besides the weak trading results, earnings were also hit by several charges, including a $557 million increase in reserves for litigation expenses, and a $400 million restructuring charge resulting from the elimination of 5,000 jobs in the fourth quarter.
One bright spot was a drop in loan losses, which declined 40 percent to $4.1 billion, suggesting that for consumers at least, the economy was becoming more solid. In addition, the bank said that total loans outstanding rose 14 percent to $465.4 billion for the year.

HEADLINE: The Pros and Cons of Obama's Reorganization Plan

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Some elements of President Obama's plan to consolidate government departments make little sense, but abolishing the Small Business Administration is an excellent place to start, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
On Friday, President Obamaannounced plans to consolidate a number of federal agencies related to business and trade into a single agency in order to improve efficiency and the international competitiveness of American companies.
The agencies to be combined are the Department of Commerce, the Small Business Administration, the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Trade and Development Agency, and the Office of the Trade Representative. A 2010 report from the Congressional Research Service provides a good overview of the functions of these organizations.
This is not a new idea. In 1983, President Reagan asked Congress for a similar reorganization. According to a New York Times article, the purpose of the new agency was to create an American version of Japan's powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry.

At the time, Japan was widely viewed the same way China is today: as our greatest economic competitor and potentially a national security threat as well. Books like "MITI and the Japanese Miracle" (1982) by Chalmers Johnson were widely read. They glorified Japan's "industrial policy" and praised its bureaucrats for vision and skill in using a combination of trade restrictions, targeted subsidies and regulatory policy to create an economic juggernaut.
While not seeking to emulate MITI's heavy-handed command and control of private industry, American officials did see international trade, especially export prowess, as a key to economic prosperity and national power. 
If it took selective trade restrictions on strategic goods like computer chips or subsidies to domestic manufacturers, then that's what it took to maintain American supremacy in a world in which nuclear weapons counted for less and trade deficits were a sign of weakness.
Economists were less impressed by MITI than political scientists such as Dr. Johnson. The economists thought that Japan's economic success lay mainly in its excellent tax and budget policies - which actually had their roots in the American occupation after World War II when Gen. Douglas MacArthur had the Columbia University economist Carl Shoup study the Japanese tax system and write a report whose recommendations were largely implemented.
Japan also had a highly competitive domestic market, a high savings rate and strong productivity growth. 
These macroeconomic factors were far more important to Japan's postwar economic success than anything MITI accomplished, the economists asserted.
In the late 1980s, cracks in MITI's facade of invincibility were evident. By the early 1990s, high-profile MITI initiatives in advanced computers and nuclear power were widely viewed as failures. 
Economists began increasingly to view MITI as a hindrance to growth. Books like "Divided Sun: MITI and the Breakdown of Japanese High-Tech Industrial Policy, 1975-1993" (1995) by Scott Callon reflected the growing consensus, as did the 1996 article by the economists Richard Beason and David Weinstein in the Review of Economics and Statistics.
By 2001, the Japanese government accepted the MITI critique and effectively abolished it, folding it into the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. A 2002 study published by the Ministry of Finance concluded, "The Japanese model was not the source of Japanese competiveness, but the cause of our failure." 
Economists now discourage developing nations from adopting Japanese-style industrial policies.
Nevertheless, the Obama administration appears enamored with exactly the sort of industrial policy that Japan rejected. Last year, the president promised to double exports over five years, a goal most economists considered fanciful; has promoted "Buy America" requirements that have roiled trade relations with Canada, the United States' largest trading partner; and often extols the special virtues of manufacturing companies, proposing more special tax breaks for them just last week.
One provision of Mr. Obama's reorganization plan that is of particular concern to free traders is folding the Office of the Trade Representative into the Commerce Department. 
I know from personal experience at the Treasury Department that in internal administration discussions of trade policy the various agencies are expected to play certain roles. Commerce always defends whatever business wants because that's its job. The Council of Economic Advisers always takes the principled free trade position, and so on.
At the end, the Office of the Trade Representative is the "honest broker," a role that would be impossible for it to play as part of the parochial Commerce Department. The Office of the Trade Representative's ability to fulfill this function is now assured by its position as part of the executive office of the president. This allows it to take the broad view of what is in the best interest of the country as a whole and bargain with our trading partners in good faith.
To effectively abolish the Office of the Trade Representative is a dreadful idea. It is a small agency; there are no efficiency gains to be realized by making it another bureau within Commerce. And no matter what promises are made to guarantee its independence, placing the Office of the Trade Representative within Commerce will inevitably politicize the office. 
It's easier to defend the transfer of other agencies like S.B.A. into a revamped Commerce Department. There's no evidence that S.B.A. does much of anything to promote small businesses. Its independent status has made it easier for those that benefit from its programs to essentially capture it and use it to channel funds to favored constituencies. 
Conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation have for years called for S.B.A. to be abolished.
The Obama proposal may just be an election year ploy so that he can continue to say that he will create two million jobs through exports. It may also be designed to force Congressional Republicans to choose between their professed love of small businesses and the ineffectiveness and waste of the S.B.A. 
But the Obama proposal may also indicate a commitment to discredited industrial policies and a subordination of trade policy to political interests.

HEADLINE: The (Solar) Light at the End of the Tunnel

BYLINE: FELICITY BARRINGER


HIGHLIGHT: Seven military bases in Southern California could accommodate the addition of 7,000 megawatts of solar power if obstacles like inadequate transmission capacity can be overcome, a report says. 

 BODY:
A consultant for the Defense Departmentreports that introducing solar installations on nine military bases in the Mojave and Colorado Desert could generate 7,000 megawatts of power.
Depending on which yardstick you prefer, that amounts to the output of seven average nuclear plants or six large coal-fired plants. It would also amount to 25 percent of the renewable energy that California will require its utilities to produce by 2015, according to the 13 authors of the report, prepared by the consultancy ICF International. 
The report says that electricity generated annually from such solar installations would be equivalent to two-thirds of what the Department of Defense consumes nationwide each year.
Perhaps as much to the point, the report also notes that the military could earn as much as $100 millionannually from such solar installations, from rental payments to discounts on power. "Private developers can tap the solar potential with no capital investment required from the D.O.D.," it adds.
What is more, full development of this solar capability would mean avoiding emissions of millions of tons of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, the report said.
One of the bases mentioned in the report, Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, already boasts the largest photovoltaic array in the nation, a five-year-old 14-megawatt project. 
But beyond that, the consultants found, another 30,873 acres of military land is suitable for similar solar arrays on land belonging to California bases, like Fort Irwin, an Army base that has already hosted an experimentin "cool roofs" for new base housing; Edwards Air Force Base (whose history was excerpted in Tom Wolfe's "The Right Stuff"); the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms; and the Naval Air Facility in El Centro, where Prince Harrytrainedlast year.
Another 101,000 acres were deemed "likely suitable" or "questionably suitable."
At least 96 percent of the land on the bases was ruled unsuitable because solar development would interfere with military activities, because the land provides essential habitat to species like the desert tortoise, because of topography like steep slopes, or because construction could harm a cultural resource like a rich archaeological site or an area important to a Native American group. 
Even so, the remaining lands, rooftops, parking lots and the like offer rich solar potential for photovoltaic and perhaps concentrated solar facilities if hurdles like transmission capacity could be overcome, the study indicated.
 "There are a range of technical, policy and programmatic barriers that can slow or, in some cases, stop solar development," the report cautions. "Transmission capacity and the management of withdrawn lands are the two most important issues."
The study's economic analysis, calculating a 20-year investment return, assumes that all construction would take place in 2015 (allowing for lead-in planning and procurement time) and that the price of photovoltaic arrays will drop 20 percent or so from last year's levels. 
The solar energy installations could also make the military bases less vulnerable to disruptions of the public electricity grid, the report added. Currently the Defense Department relies on individual diesel generators to insure power in the event of a grid interruption, it noted. 
As the military bases rely more on secure microgrids to meet energy needs, the authors predict, solar power can play an ever more important role.

HEADLINE: The Breakfast Meeting: Gingrich Finds a Foil and Wikipedia Protests SOPA

BYLINE: NOAM COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Looking at Mitt Romney's years in Massachusetts and seeing whether 3-D can make the jump to the real world. 

 BODY:
The presidential debate in South Carolina Monday night - sponsored by Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and the state Republican Party - was notable for its raucous crowd. Newt Gingrich, who was considered by most analysts to have had a very successful night, "seemed to revel" in using one of the questioners, the Fox News analyst Juan Williams, as his foil, Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg write. Mr. Gingrich won loud, sustained applause when replying with mock impatience to Mr. Williams who pressed him about his call for schoolchildren to work as janitors, for his description of Mr. Obama as a "food stamp president" and remarks that Mr. Williams said, to loud boos, seemed "intended to belittle the poor."

        
In the hours before the debate, President Obama's political adviser, David Axelrod, and an adviser to Mitt Romney, Eric Fehrnstrom, sparred via Twitter, Ashley Parker writes. The were arguing about the economy - who is to blame for its struggles, and how best to fix it - perhaps setting up the issues in a general election if Mr. Romney wins his party's nomination.
        
A new biography, "The Real Romney," written by two Boston Globe reporters who benefited from the paper's familiarity with Mr. Romney when he was governor of Massachusetts, is being released today. Here is Michiko Kakutani's review.
The ratings powerhouse "American Idol" is returning this week to Fox as other singing talent shows are laying down roots on television, including "X Factor," created by the former "Idol" mainstay Simon Cowell, and "The Voice," which will follow the Super Bowl on NBC. The singing shows will never be in direct competition, but as Bill Carter and Brian Stelter write, the question is: "Will viewers still gravitate to 'Idol' in the same numbers when they know there are two prominent alternatives?"
The Australian director Baz Luhrmann is making a high-budget version of "The Great Gatsby," with Leonard DiCaprio in the title role. The reason this movie, which is scheduled for release next Christmas, is being written about by Michael Cieply even now is that Mr. Luhrmann is filming in 3-D and has the potential to break a barrier. The film will show, he writes, "whether 3-D can actually serve actors as they struggle through a complex story set squarely inside the natural world."
English Wikipedia will go black on Wednesday in protest of antipiracy legislation, including the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, being considered by the United States Congress, Jenna Wortham writes. That day, Jan. 18, will be a day of protest across the Internet, but no other site participating has the reach of Wikipedia, which is estimated to have 25 million unique visitors a day. Those visitors, instead of finding what they were searching for, will be encouraged to call their members of Congress to oppose the legislation.

        
The post to Twitter, from Jimmy Wales, that spread the news: "Student warning! Do your homework early. Wikipedia protesting bad law on Wednesday!"

        
Andrew Lih, an early contributor to Wikipedia and a journalism professor at the University of Southern California, has a Storify-ed summary of the news, including a sample of what Wikipedia will look like on Wednesday.
An earlier version of this post misstated the estimated number of unique visitors to Wikipedia each day. It is 25 million, not 25.

HEADLINE: Obama to Accept Nomination in Stadium After Shortened Convention

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: Capping a three-day national convention in Charlotte, N.C., President Obama will give his acceptance speech and officially kickoff the general election on Sept. 6 at the Bank of America Stadium, home field of the Carolina Panthers 

 BODY:
President Obama once again will accept the Democratic presidential nomination from a football stadium to accommodate tens of thousands more supporters, and after a shorter-than-usual convention, convention planners announced on Tuesday.
Capping a three-day national convention in Charlotte, N.C., Mr. Obama will give his acceptance speech and officially kickoff the general-election campaign against Republicans' nominee on Sept. 6 at the Bank of America Stadium, home field of the Carolina Panthers professional football team, said Steve Kerrigan, chief executive officer for the Democrats' convention committee.
In August 2008, the emotional climax of the Democratic convention in Denver was Mr. Obama's twilight speech before an estimated 84,000 people at Invesco Field at Mile High, home of the Denver Broncos. 
Mr. Kerrigan, in an e-mail to party supporters, said the convention would be shorter than the traditional four days, opening on the Tuesday after Labor Day. But on Labor Day an event will be held at the Charlotte Motor Speedway - a site recommended online by an Obama supporter, "Jerry in Tryon, N.C." - to kick-off get-out-the-vote efforts to mobilize voters not only in North Carolina but in Virginia. The Obama campaign has targeted both battleground states, hoping to repeat Mr. Obama's victories in each in 2008 but in a tougher political environment given voters' unhappiness with continued high unemployment. 
Republicans will nominate their candidate in August in Tampa, Fla.

HEADLINE: Former Challenger to Barney Frank to Run in 2012

BYLINE: BY JESS BIDGOOD


HIGHLIGHT: Sean Bielat, a Republican who ran an aggressive race against Representative Barney Frank in 2010, said Tuesday that he would again seek the seat in Massachusetts' 4th Congressional District. 

 BODY:
Sean Bielat, a Republican who ran an aggressive race against Representative Barney Frank in 2010, said Tuesday that he would again seek the seat in Massachusetts' 4th Congressional District.
Mr. Bielat, a 36-year-old businessman and former Marine, raised his political profile when he ran against Mr. Frank. Mr. Bielat lost by 11 percentage points, but still posted the closest finish of any rival to Mr. Frank in decades.
"In 2010, I think we made a lot of progress, we started a movement of sorts and in 2012 we can continue that, and bring it to fruition - that is, actually win in November," Mr. Bielat told The Times shortly before his announcement on Tuesday.
In November 2011, Mr. Frank announced his intention to retire at the end of his current term, citing in part the recently redrawn lines of his district, which lost the Democratic stronghold of New Bedford while gaining a group of more conservative towns in Massachusetts' Blackstone Valley.
"The redrawn district is obviously more attractive than it was," said Mr. Bielat, at the time.
Mr. Bielat said he expects his campaign to be similar to his 2010 run because many of his key concerns haven't changed. "We haven't seen progress on the economy," Mr. Bielat said. "People just aren't happy with the leadership we've seen here in Washington."
In a fund-raising letter sent on Jan. 12, Mr. Bielat pitted himself against Joseph Kennedy III, the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy who last week announced his intention to explore a run for Congress.
"The Massachusetts Democrats are desperate to reclaim Barney Frank's district and re-brand it as yet another 'Kennedy Seat,'" read the letter, referencing the Senate seat held by Edward M. Kennedy before Republican Scott Brown won it, in a surprise upset, in 2010. "We can't let this happen! Putting someone into office simply because of his family is bad for Massachusetts, and it's bad for the nation."
Elizabeth Childs, a school-committee member from Brookline, Mass., has also entered the race on the Republican side.

HEADLINE: For God So Loved the 1 Percent ...

BYLINE: KEVIN M. KRUSE


HIGHLIGHT: The phrase "under God" was not conceived to promote unity, but capitalism and conservatism. 

 BODY:
Princeton, N.J.
IN recent weeks Mitt Romney has become the poster child for unchecked capitalism, a role he seems to embrace with relish. Concerns about economic equality, he told Matt Lauer of NBC, were really about class warfare.
"When you have a president encouraging the idea of dividing America based on the 99 percent versus 1 percent," he said, "you have opened up a whole new wave of approach in this country which is entirely inconsistent with the concept of one nation under God."
Mr. Romney was on to something, though perhaps not what he intended.
The concept of "one nation under God" has a noble lineage, originating in Abraham Lincoln's hope at Gettysburg that "this nation, under God, shall not perish from the earth." After Lincoln, however, the phrase disappeared from political discourse for decades. But it re-emerged in the mid-20th century, under a much different guise: corporate leaders and conservative clergymen deployed it to discredit Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.
During the Great Depression, the prestige of big business sank along with stock prices. Corporate leaders worked frantically to restore their public image and simultaneously roll back the "creeping socialism" of the welfare state. Notably, the American Liberty League, financed by corporations like DuPont and General Motors, made an aggressive case for capitalism. Most, however, dismissed its efforts as self-interested propaganda. (A Democratic Party official joked that the organization should have been called "the American Cellophane League" because "first, it's a DuPont product and, second, you can see right through it.")
Realizing that they needed to rely on others, these businessmen took a new tack: using generous financing to enlist sympathetic clergymen as their champions. After all, according to one tycoon, polls showed that, "of all the groups in America, ministers had more to do with molding public opinion" than any other.
The Rev. James W. Fifield, pastor of the elite First Congregational Church of Los Angeles, led the way in championing a new union of faith and free enterprise. "The blessings of capitalism come from God," he wrote. "A system that provides so much for the common good and happiness must flourish under the favor of the Almighty."
Christianity, in Mr. Fifield's interpretation, closely resembled capitalism, as both were systems in which individuals rose or fell on their own. The welfare state, meanwhile, violated most of the Ten Commandments. It made a "false idol" of the federal government, encouraged Americans to covet their neighbors' possessions, stole from the wealthy and, ultimately, bore false witness by promising what it could never deliver.
Throughout the 1930s and '40s, Mr. Fifield and his allies advanced a new blend of conservative religion, economics and politics that one observer aptly anointed "Christian libertarianism." Mr. Fifield distilled his ideology into a simple but powerful phrase - "freedom under God." With ample support from corporate patrons and business lobbies like the United States Chamber of Commerce, his gospel of godly capitalism soon spread across the country through personal lectures, weekly radio broadcasts and a monthly magazine.
In 1951, the campaign culminated in a huge Fourth of July celebration of the theme. Former President Herbert C. Hoover and Gen. Douglas MacArthur headlined an organizing committee of conservative all-stars, including celebrities like Walt Disney and Ronald Reagan, but largely comprising business titans like Conrad Hilton, J. C. Penney, Harvey Firestone Jr. and J. Howard Pew.
In an extensive public relations campaign, they encouraged communities to commemorate Independence Day with "freedom under God" ceremonies, using full-page newspaper ads trumpeting the connection between faith and free enterprise. They also held a nationwide sermon contest on the theme, with clergymen competing for cash. Countless local events were promoted by a national "Freedom Under God" radio program, produced with the help of the filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille, hosted by Jimmy Stewart and broadcast on CBS.
Ultimately, these organizers believed that they had made a lasting impression. "The very words 'freedom under God' have added to the vocabulary of freedom a new term," they boasted. Soon the entire nation would think of itself as "under God." Indeed, in 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower presided over the first presidential prayer breakfast on a "government under God" theme and worked to promote public religiosity in a variety of ways. In 1954, as this "under-God consciousness" swept the nation, Congress formally added the phrase to the Pledge of Allegiance.
In the end, Mr. Romney is correct to claim that complaints about economic inequality are inconsistent with the concept of "one nation under God." But that's only because the "1 percent" of an earlier era intended it that way.

HEADLINE: Majority of Chinese Now Live in Cities

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China's urban population exceeded its rural population in 2011 for the first time in the nation's history, the government's National Bureau of Statistics reported, continuing a trend that has helped drive its rapid economic growth but poses an increasingly difficult social transition for scores of millions of Chinese. 
The statistics bureau stated that China counted 690.79 million urbanites at the year's end, an increase of 21 million, compared to 656.56 million rural-dwellers, down 14.56 million.
The shift furnishes a ready labor force for the factories that power China's export-based economy, and better wages in cities have contributed to raising hundreds of millions from poverty.
But it also has fueled an urban underclass of migrants and jobless without proper housing and social services, and the hollowing of the countryside has left the elderly without family close by and deprived farms of needed labor.
Barely 10 percent of Chinese lived in cities when Communist forces took control of the Chinese mainland in 1949, Reuters reported. Globally, about 51 percent of people now live in cities, including 51.27 percent of Chinese citizens. The United States counts 82 percent of its residents as city-dwellers.

HEADLINE: New Gas Economy Rules Generate Wide Support

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Writing new regulations that will require cars and trucks to have significantly higher fuel economy by 2025 prompted years of fighting among automakers, environmentalists, regulators and consumer groups.
But now that the standards have been proposed, nearly everyone involved in the process is on board with the results, as a public hearing held Tuesday in Detroit showed.
More than 90 people who spoke throughout the day asserted that the stricter fuel economy requirements would create jobs, reduce oil consumption, create cleaner air and save drivers money, all while helping automakers increase their profits. 
''We're celebrating something that has taken a long time to reach,'' said Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who helped quash previous efforts to impose higher mileage standards. ''There appears to be no significant opposition amongst responsible persons.''
The National Automobile Dealers Association, however, did speak out against the idea of setting requirements for vehicles made more than a decade from now until more is known about the strength of consumer demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles.
Don Chalmers, a Ford dealer in New Mexico and the group's government relations chairman, said he worried that vehicles would become too expensive for some consumers to afford. ''Before rushing headlong into a set of new mandates aimed at doubling today's fleet fuel economy, we need to understand better the potential ramifications,'' Mr. Chalmers said. ''If our customers do not purchase these products, we all lose.''
The proposed new standards call for automakers to increase the average, unadjusted fuel-economy rating of their vehicles to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, up from about 27 miles per gallon today. Because of the way testing is done, the 2025 requirement correlates to a window-sticker rating of about 36 miles per gallon, according to the automotive information Web site Edmunds.com, or roughly what Toyota's tiny new Scion iQ car achieves today.
Additional hearings on the standards will take place Thursday in Philadelphia and Jan. 24 in San Francisco. The Obama administration this month extended the public comment period for the proposal by two weeks, to Feb. 13, and expects to finalize the regulations this summer.
The administration says the higher standards will cause vehicle prices to increase about $2,000 but that owners will save an average of $6,600 over the life of the vehicle by using less fuel. The rules also will create 484,000 jobs and cut oil consumption in the United States by 1.5 million barrels a day by 2030, according to the Go60mpg coalition, an association of environmental advocacy groups that support the proposal.
Mr. Chalmers said the government's analysis greatly underestimates how much the rules will cause vehicle prices to rise. He said the actual increase could be up to $5,000, causing an average buyer's monthly payments to go up by $60 or $70 and potentially locking out shoppers who would not be able to obtain financing for the higher price, regardless of their fuel savings later on.
Some individual dealers disagreed, though, and said they welcomed the new requirements.
''Our customers strongly desire more fuel-efficient vehicles,'' said Doug Fox, who has five dealerships in Ann Arbor, Mich., selling Nissan, Hyundai and other brands. ''Everyone seems to win on this deal.''
Michael Robinson, vice president for sustainability and regulatory affairs at General Motors, said the company probably would submit recommendations for some technical changes and clarifications to the rules, noting that the proposal is 1,000 pages long. But G.M. is ''over all, very satisfied'' with the standards, he told reporters.
''We are on a good path toward meeting the early requirements that this proposal will create,'' Mr. Robinson said during the hearing. ''But we will need further breakthroughs in technology and good customer acceptance of the additional vehicle changes, technologies and costs that will be associated with providing the vehicles needed in future years to allow us continued success in meeting the aggressive requirements down the road.''
G.M., the Ford Motor Company, Chrysler, and other automakers agreed last summer to support the framework of the higher standards.
The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group, said all of its members supported the standards through 2016, when they would be required to achieve 36 miles per gallon. The German carmakers Volkswagen and Daimler have not endorsed the requirements past that point.
The president of the United Automobile Workers union, Bob King, said he supported increasing the fuel economy of vehicles because it would create jobs and better protect the jobs of current workers by helping the industry thrive.
''The proposed rules are sensible, achievable and needed,'' Mr. King said. ''They are good for the auto industry and its workers, good for the broader economy, good for the environment and good for our national security.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Presses South Korea to Reduce Oil Imports from Iran

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- A senior American diplomat urged South Korea on Tuesday to reduce its imports of Iranian crude oil as the United States continued to seek support from major Asian economies to increase pressure on Tehran to halt its nuclear program. 
''We are urging all of our partners to help us, to work with us in putting more pressure on the government of Iran to get them to negotiate seriously,'' Robert J. Einhorn, the State Department's special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control, told reporters in Seoul, where he met Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Jae-shin of South Korea on Tuesday. ''In particular, we are urging them to reduce their purchases of crude oil from Iran, and we are urging them to unwind their financial dealings with the Central Bank of Iran.''
South Korea deals with Iran's central bank to make payments for the oil, which supplies almost 10 percent of its oil imports.
Washington is trying to curtail Iran's oil exports, its main revenue source, and isolate the central bank. Delegations from the State, Energy and Treasury Departments are fanning out to Iran's major customers, as well as to rival oil producers, to enlist their help in stifling Iran's oil exports while making up any gap in supplies.
South Korea, a crucial American ally, voiced support for Washington's efforts to check Iran's nuclear program. Seoul depends on the United States for its defense against North Korea and works together with Washington to curb the North's nuclear weapons program. American officials believe that a successful crackdown on Iran's nuclear program could help curb North Korea's.
But leaders of South Korea, which depends on imported oil, fear a sudden reduction in purchases from Iran might disrupt South Korea's energy security and raise oil prices. Fighting inflation is President Lee Myung-bak's key policy promise for 2012.
Seoul has yet to announce whether and by how much it might reduce its oil imports from Iran.
South Korea was ''committed to strongly supporting and participating in international efforts'' to end the Iranian nuclear dispute, Mr. Kim said. ''But many South Koreans are quite worried that further strengthening sanctions against Iran may at this time destabilize the international market of crude oil.''
Mr. Einhorn said the United States remained ''very sensitive to the economic interests of our close allies'' and wanted to pressure Iran ''while maintaining stability of international oil markets.''
''We are confident that working together we can send this signal, and we can do it without the adverse effects that I know many in South Korea are concerned about,'' he said.
The European Union is weighing an embargo on Iranian oil, while Tehran has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, through which almost 20 percent of the world's oil flows, if its oil exports are reduced.

HEADLINE: Surviving a Big Risk on Fifth Avenue

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
The Kushner Companies' purchase in 2007 of 666 Fifth Avenue, an aluminum-clad office tower in Midtown Manhattan, for a record price of $1.8 billion is considered a classic example of reckless underwriting. The transaction was so highly leveraged that the cash flow from rents amounted to only 65 percent of the debt service.
As many real estate specialists predicted, the deal ran into trouble. Instead of rising, rents declined as the recession took hold, and new leases were scarce. In 2010, the loan was transferred to a special servicer on the assumption that a default would occur once reserve funds being used to subsidize the shortfall were bled dry.
But the story may yet have a happy ending for Kushner, a family-owned business that moved its headquarters from Florham Park, N.J., to 666 Fifth, its first major acquisition in Manhattan. 
Instead of foreclosing on the 39-story building, which stretches from 52nd Street to 53rd Street, the lenders agreed last month to reduce the principal and defer some of the interest payments on the interest-only loan and extend its maturity for two years, until February 2019. In exchange, Kushner and its powerful new partner in the deal, Vornado Realty Trust, agreed to pour tens of millions of dollars into the building to improve its leasing prospects. The 1.5-million-square feet office building is currently 30 percent vacant.
The modification of the Kushner loan reflects a larger confidence in the city's long-term future as a financial center. While many commercial mortgages across the country are still in trouble -- and more distress is expected -- those in New York City are in better shape.
Of the $11.8 billion in commercial loans in Manhattan that were classified as troubled since 2008, just $3.4 billion, or 29 percent, remains in distress, said Ben Carlos Thypin, the director of market analysis for Real Capital Analytics, a New York research firm. About $3.5 billion in loans -- covering 14 buildings, including 666 Fifth Avenue, 3 Columbus Circle and 280 Park Avenue -- have been restructured.
Borrowers who default are in a much better position today than they would have been in the last downturn, when regulators forced banks to take their losses and swiftly dispose of their troubled loans, said Alexander Goldfarb, a managing director at the brokerage firm Sandler O'Neill. During the last cycle, loans for large office buildings were packaged into securities and sold on Wall Street. Now, the bondholders have a strong incentive to modify their loan terms, often with existing borrowers.
''In the early '90s, people knew that real estate was going to be purged at so many cents on the dollar,'' Mr. Goldfarb said. ''This time around, the borrowers know the regulators and the government are on their side, so they can put up a substantial fight.'' In states like New York, a foreclosure risks being tied up in the courts for years.
In the recent restructuring of 666 Fifth Avenue, Kushner and Vornado promised not to contest a foreclosure in the event of another default.
''The good news about our capital structure is that the loan is in place till 2019, and we have over $100 million that we can spend,'' said Jared Kushner, the 31-year-old chief executive of Kushner. ''We've put ourselves in a position where we can be competitive to attract tenants.''
In the near term, office tenants may not be easy to find. Brokers say large financial institutions are reluctant to make long-term commitments right now because of uncertainty over the European debt crisis and the lingering economic downturn. ''We're in a period of anxiety,'' said Mitchell S. Steir, chief executive of Studley, a brokerage firm that represents tenants.
Though 666 Fifth Avenue has some of the most lucrative retail space in the world, the restructuring applies only to the office building. In 2008, Kushner sold a 49 percent stake for $525 million in the building's retail space -- which became a separate condo -- to the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, and Crown Acquisitions. Some of the proceeds were used to pay off Kushner's $355 million mezzanine loan, thereby enabling the company to hold on to the building.
''It was a very savvy move,'' said Howard L. Michaels, the chairman of Carlton Advisory Services and the adviser on the retail sale. In 2010, the Japanese retailer Uniqlo agreed to open a flagship store at 666 Fifth for an eye-popping rent of $20 million a year.
Last year, the partners in the retail space sold one piece of it to the retailer Zara for $324 million, or $8,300 a square foot. Some of those proceeds were used to pay down a separate mortgage they had obtained for the retail condo.
But while the value of the retail space was soaring, the office tower was losing tenants because of its precarious financial situation. Attempts to get the loan restructured began well before the loan was transferred to the special servicer, said Mr. Kushner, who is also the publisher of The New York Observer. He has been the public face of Kushner Companies, since his father, Charles, was released from federal prison in 2006 after pleading guilty to witness tampering and other charges.
The lengthy restructuring process may have worked to Kushner's advantage. ''The deal they cut now is probably better than the deal they could have cut two years ago,'' said Manus Clancy, the senior managing director of Trepp, another New York research company.
Under its terms, the existing $1.215 billion office loan was divided into two pieces -- a senior loan of $1.1 billion, representing the current value of the building at $835 a square foot, and a subordinate loan for $115 million. These subordinate loans are called ''hope'' notes since they may never be repaid.
Vornado, which received a 49.5 percent interest in the building, and Kushner agreed to invest $110 million to provide incentives for tenants, pay brokers' commissions and refurbish obsolete space. Kushner's $30 million share will come from a modified ''air and light'' agreement pertaining to a planned hotel for 53rd Street; the hotel's developers will no longer be blocked from using their own air rights to build extra stories on 53rd Street.
In exchange for putting fresh cash into 666 Fifth Avenue, Vornado and Kushner will have the right to recoup this money (with interest, in Vornado's case) before the subordinate loan is repaid. ''By all appearances, it seems like a fantastic deal for Vornado,'' said Robert M. White Jr., the chief executive of Real Capital Analytics.
Vornado has taken an ownership stake in several troubled Manhattan properties. But the 666 Fifth deal raised some eyebrows because Vornado is also a part-owner of the special servicer on the loan, LNR Partners of Miami Beach. Vornado did not respond to a request for an interview.
Kushner was advised by Robert Verrone, who was known as Large Loan Verrone at Wachovia Bank because he financed such large deals as the $5.4 billion purchase of Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, the giant housing complex in Manhattan. Mr. Verrone has a new business, Iron Hound Management, and has done $5.5 billion worth of recapitalization and restructuring deals, he said.
Though the 666 Fifth bondholders are worse off now, because the principal is smaller and some interest payments will not be made, they too benefitted from the restructuring, said Frank Innaurato, a managing director at Morningstar. ''This mitigates the longer-term loss potential for the deal,'' he said. ''The lenders are not losing as much as they could have.''

HEADLINE: World Bank Warns Developing Nations of Slowing Growth

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The World Bank is urging developing nations to start planning for a major slowdown in global growth this year.
In a report released Tuesday, the Washington-based bank lowered its growth forecasts for high-income and low-income countries, saying it expected the world economy to expand an aggregate 2.5 percent in 2012, down from about 2.7 percent in 2011. In its previous estimate, in June, it forecast growth of 3.6 percent in 2012.
The bank also warned of the continued threat of a global financial shock ''similar in magnitude to the Lehman crisis,'' because of the possibility that a major European economy could be shut out of the global debt markets. In that case, the bank estimated the damage to the world's economic growth would rival the recession of 2008 and 2009. 
''The largest economy in the world is weakening,'' Justin Yifu Lin, the bank's chief economist, said in an interview, referring to the European Union. ''The message for developing countries is to start preparing now.''
The report was issued as forecasters warned of slower growth in the United States. Estimates of the nation's annual pace of growth reached as high as 4 percent in the final months of 2011. But economists contend the strength came in part from temporary measures, including wholesalers restocking their inventories and consumers saving less and spending more over the holidays.
Economists say they expect many headwinds in early 2012: rising oil prices as the United States and European countries confront Iran; the risk of a tax cut for American wage earners expiring; a strong dollar rendering American exports less competitive; and continued repercussions from the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.
In the report, the biannual Global Economic Prospects, the bank predicted that high-income countries, including the United States, France, Japan and Germany, would grow 1.4 percent in 2012. It forecast a mild contraction of 0.3 percent in the 17 countries that use the euro. Developing countries will grow 5.4 percent, down from a forecast of 6.2 percent in June, the bank said.
The reason for the global slowdown is twofold, said Andrew Burns, head of global macroeconomics at the World Bank and the main author of the report. First, developing countries like Turkey, India, Russia and Brazil were ''overheating'' in the rebound after the recession and have tightened monetary policy to help curb inflation, he said. Second, he added, the euro zone crisis has frightened investors, and austerity budgets adopted in countries, including Italy and Greece, have weighed on growth.
Mr. Burns said those trends created a ''dangerous dynamic,'' with the slowdown in emerging economies sapping growth from advanced economies, and the downturn in advanced economies worsening prospects for emerging markets. ''The events are feeding off of one another,'' he said.
A worst case in Europe could lead to significant hardship for emerging economies, the report said. Commodity prices could fall as much as 24 percent, hurting government revenue in export-dependent nations. Global trade volumes could fall by more than 7 percent. Countries in Central Asia and Eastern Europe would be hit hardest, the bank said.
But even if catastrophe does not occur, growth looks weaker, the bank said. For instance, the World Bank estimates world trade will expand only 4.7 percent in 2012, down from 12.4 percent in 2010.
Last summer, the World Bank noted significant ''contagion from Europe to developing countries,'' Mr. Burns said. Risk-averse investors slashed financing to emerging markets, with gross capital flows falling to $170 billion in the second half of 2011 from about $309 billion in the same period in 2010. In addition, borrowing costs began to rise in developing countries.
The bank said developing economies should prepare for declining investment from abroad, less-robust exports, and reduced remittances. Governments should rigorously stress test their financial institutions, plan major infrastructure projects to help support demand and ensure the viability of their social safety nets, the report said.
Mr. Lin said advanced economies should consider more immediate fiscal stimulus to support growth, locally and globally. ''They need to carry out structural reforms in the long-term,'' he said. ''But in the short term, they need an intervention to provide a short-term boost to demand.''
He warned that emerging markets have less room for fiscal and monetary stimulus than they did in 2008 and 2009, even though they have more capacity than many developed countries. Many high-income countries, including the United States, are already struggling with heavy debt loads, limiting the possibility of fiscal stimulus. And central banks have already overextended their balance sheets and pushed interest rates close to zero, limiting monetary stimulus, Mr. Burns said in an interview.
The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank's sister organization, echoed its warnings about the dangers slowing trade and uncertainty about Europe pose to emerging markets.
In a speech Monday, David Lipton, the fund's first deputy managing director, said there was reason for optimism, given the lessons learned in the 2008 crisis. But, he warned: ''Europe could be swept into a downward spiral of collapsing confidence, stagnant growth and fewer jobs. And in today's interconnected global economy, no country and no region would be immune from that catastrophe.''
The fund is expected to update its World Economic Outlook on Jan. 24. It said it would cut its growth forecast from predictions it issued last September.
World Bank officials emphasized the importance of confidence, given uncertainty about Europe and worries about slowing growth. Mr. Burns said investor sentiment ''could have an enormous impact cumulatively.''

HEADLINE: Tenants Gain Advantage in Office Tower Market

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
In New York's most exclusive office towers, the pendulum of power has swung from landlords, who last year basked in rising rents and competition for prime buildings, to tenants, who are now being offered incentives like prebuilt offices to fill empty spaces. And the leverage held by tenants is likely to continue through this year, market experts say.
''There is no question that during the second half of 2011 leasing velocity slowed in the premier properties,'' said Neil Goldmacher, a vice chairman at Newmark Knight Frank. ''The fact is, there are a limited number of tenants who will pay three digits in this economic environment.''
At first glance, it appears the trophy office market -- which includes 9 West 57th Street, the Seagram's Building at 375 Park Avenue, 712 Fifth Avenue and a handful of others -- ended 2011 on an upswing. According to data from Cushman & Wakefield, there were 46 leases with rents of $100 a square foot or greater in 33 separate buildings last year, compared with just 18 such leases in 13 buildings in 2010. The average starting rent in the trophy market also jumped, reaching $154.75 in 2011 compared with $114.80 in 2010, Cushman & Wakefield reported. 
But a closer examination shows that the bulk of those leases, 28, came in the first half of 2011. In terms of the most deals per quarter, the second quarter peaked, with 16 deals with rents of $100 or greater. That fell to just nine leases in the fourth quarter, typically a strong time of year.
And two expensive first-quarter leases at 9 West 57th Street were largely responsible for driving up last year's overall starting rents: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company's 64,000-square-foot lease at $147 a square foot and Apollo Management Holdings LP's 32,800-square-foot-lease at $160 and $165 a square foot -- an increase caused by a rent bump during the nine-year lease term.
''The message that the $100 deals are back is true, to a point,'' said Alan Desino, an executive managing director at Colliers International, who represents tenants. ''There are more deals than in 2010 or 2009, but it is still a 40 percent drop from the peak in 2007.''
Several factors caused the slowdown in the second half of 2011, including the shifting employment in the financial services sector, which leases the bulk of the space at the trophy buildings. Wall Street added 8,210 jobs from December 2010 to April 2011. At the same time, pent-up demand stemming from the recession was released, and more tenants entered the market.
''There was real momentum in the market during the first half of the year,'' said Tara I. Stacom, a vice chairwoman at Cushman & Wakefield. Landlords snubbed several tenants when larger deals came up; for example, the law firm WilmerHale was bumped from 825 Eighth Avenue in favor of Nomura Holdings America, and Wells Fargo was pushed out of 120 Park Avenue in favor of Bloomberg L.P. The expensive deals signed by K.K.R. and Apollo at 9 West 57th Street also set a high bar for rents.
But from last April to November, the financial services sector shed 5,670 jobs. The sector's woes were compounded by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the stalemate in the federal government over the debt ceiling and the eruption of the European debt crisis. ''The result of the negative news meant trading volumes dropped, leading to declining, or at best flat, revenues, and this created job losses on Wall Street,'' said Ken McCarthy, a senior economist and senior managing director at Cushman & Wakefield.
The Paramount Group, which owns 712 Fifth Avenue, a modern tower set back behind historic facades on an avenue that is home to hedge funds and private equity firms, began constructing prebuilt offices this summer in vacant spaces on lower floors. That allows tenants to move directly into a space without having to design and build it themselves. The strategy, which can cost landlords anywhere from $90 to $100 a square foot, can be a way to attract tenants without lowering rents.
Now, for the first time, the Paramount Group will pursue this prebuilt strategy in two of the building's top floors, which have panoramic views of Central Park and the city skyline. ''This is the first time we will be doing prebuilts for the tower floors,'' said Ted Koltis, a senior vice president at Paramount. ''Given everything that went on this summer, in trophy buildings like ours there was a bit of a dropoff in the caliber of the tenant in the market -- we saw it quiet down.''
At 9 West 57th Street, owned by Sheldon Solow and perhaps Manhattan's most exclusive office address, the 49th floor will be carved up into smaller, prebuilt office space. The strategy is twofold, said Scott Panzer, a vice chairman at Jones Lang LaSalle who is in charge of leasing at 9 West 57th Street: ''As owners of many buildings, our buying power for constructing units is much greater than it would be for smaller tenants,'' he said. ''In addition, since we are bulk purchasing these higher-end finishings, we can offer them at a much lower cost.''
Another reason prebuilt spaces make sense now is that many tenants are waiting until the last moment to commit to a lease because of the uncertain economy.
But even with prebuilt offices, some landlords are still having trouble attracting tenants. At 510 Madison Avenue, which is roughly 55 percent vacant, the landlord Boston Properties is marketing prebuilt offices in the middle of the building. While it offers many luxury amenities, 510 Madison's views of Central Park are limited and its asking rent of $110 a square foot is a 10 to 20 percent premium over comparable buildings, brokers said.
Mr. Goldmacher said it appeared the landlord had been committed to the leasing prices it planned to charge when it acquired the building in 2010, and was using prebuilt offices and other concessions to avoid lowering rents. Boston Properties declined to comment, citing a quiet period for the company, which is about to announce earnings.
Other shifts in the market include an increasing number of short-term renewals. ''Right out of the gate tenants are looking for two- to three-year deals rather than five- or 10-year leases,'' said Cynthia Wasserberger, a managing director at Jones Lang LaSalle.
''The high-end market is very slow,'' said Ben Friedland, a senior vice president at CBRE. ''We are finding that unless they really need to make a move, tenants won't and defer it by doing short-term renewals.''
Tenants are also beginning to discuss sublease space, which is typically less expensive than office space leased directly from a landlord. Ms. Stacom said she expected the market to continue to improve for landlords, albeit slowly. ''The foot came off of the accelerator,'' she said, ''but the foot is not on the brakes.''

HEADLINE: European Court Rules Britain Cannot Deport Terrorism Suspect

BYLINE: By RAVI SOMAIYA and JOHN F. BURNS

 BODY:
LONDON -- The European Court of Human Rights ruled Tuesday that Abu Qatada, a radical Islamic preacher regarded as one of Al Qaeda's main inspirational leaders in Europe, cannot be deported from Britain to his native Jordan because his trial there would be tainted by evidence obtained by torture.
The preacher, whose real name is Omar Mahmoud Mohammed Othman, is in prison in Britain and has been convicted in his absence in Jordan of planning two bombing attacks. The British government had insisted that he be returned to Jordan as part of a wider strategy of dealing with international terrorism suspects by deportation. 
Although it accepted Jordan's assurances that Mr. Othman would be treated humanely, the European court in Strasbourg, France, said in its ruling that evidence against Mr. Othman in the Jordan bombings ''had been obtained by torturing one of his co-defendants.'' Deporting him would ''legitimize the torture of witnesses and suspects,'' it said, and ''result in a flagrant denial of justice.''
Britain has wrestled for more than a decade with a sense that it had become a safe haven and incubator for Islamic extremism, struggling to balance civil liberties and due process with security. One former senior antiterrorism police officer, who requested anonymity in order to discuss delicate security issues, said Britain had tracked as many as 100 nascent terror plots at any one time since 2001, though only a few escalated into serious threats.
Mr. Othman, like dozens of others, has been detained or at other times subjected to rigorous supervision, including home arrest, since shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. As with many of his contemporaries, his defenders claim that he has been persecuted, that he is nothing more than a very zealous Muslim who stops short of promoting violence. His detractors say he is flat-out dangerous.
The court's decision can be appealed within three months, but if upheld, it would require that Mr. Othman be released, or be charged in Britain.
The decision also emerged as the latest in a long line of disagreements between Britain and the authorities in Europe that have taken on a particularly bitter character as Prime Minister David Cameron has clashed with his counterparts in France and Germany over the financial crisis in the euro zone.
It provoked right-leaning politicians and pundits, who railed Tuesday against what they described as yet another imposition of European restrictions on British life. The Conservative lawmaker Dominic Raab told reporters that the court had run ''roughshod over decisions that should be determined by U.K. courts.''
Britain's home secretary, Theresa May, said that she was ''disappointed'' by the ruling, and that she would ''consider all the legal options available.'' She added, ''It is important to note that this ruling does not prevent us seeking to deport other foreign nationals.''
The European ruling addresses an issue that has preoccupied three British governments across a decade -- what to do with resident terrorism suspects who the authorities have argued cannot be tried in open court here without revealing intelligence secrets. They often cannot be deported to home countries with a history of mistreating prisoners.
Mr. Othman, 51, initially won the right to remain in Britain in 1993, the year he sought asylum, claiming that he had been tortured in Jordan. A father of five, he has subsequently been sought by the authorities in nine countries, including the United States. Tapes of his sermons were found in the Hamburg apartment used by Mohammed Atta, one of the hijackers involved in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
Speaking to the BBC after the attacks, Mr. Othman characterized them as ''martyrdom'' operations that should be supported by all Muslims. A 2006 report by the RAND Corporation subsequently described him as ''Al Qaeda's spiritual leader in Europe.''
Britain's close links with the Middle East and Pakistan, its formerly generous asylum policies and a history of protecting free speech also combined to make it fertile ground for many others seeking to promulgate extremist interpretations of Islam. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair was fiercely criticized for trying to address Britain's problems with Islamic extremism by introducing indefinite detention without trial for ''suspected international terrorists'' in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. Subsequent efforts have included more robust laws against inciting religious hatred, ''control orders'' that seek to monitor suspects without jailing them, tightened asylum procedures, and redoubled efforts to deport suspects.
All those measures have been subject to appeal at the European court, which sits above Britain's own Supreme Court as a final arbiter of appeals.
Many terror suspects sought by the United States, including the preacher Abu Hamza, have argued that the threat that the United States will hold them in isolation in supermaximum security prisons or at the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba, and the possibility of the death penalty, constitute human rights violations.
Aides to Mr. Cameron said that when the prime minister travels to Strasbourg next week to address the Council of Europe, which oversees the court, he will map out British proposals for limiting the court's powers to overrule the findings of the domestic courts of European Union states. One idea that has gained support among British critics of the European court is a ''democratic override'' to allow national parliaments to annul court rulings on some issues, including those that affect national security.

HEADLINE: Keeping Film Aspirations Intact While Building a Life of Sobriety

BYLINE: By JED LIPINSKI

 BODY:
The bookshelves in Joseph Salters's bedroom tell the story of his life. On the bottom shelf sit well-thumbed paperbacks with titles like ''Adult Children of Alcoholics'' and ''Narcotics Anonymous.'' The top shelf is lined with Shakespeare plays and a copy of ''Screenwriting Tricks of the Trade.''
And on the middle shelf, Mr. Salters, 51, has assembled a small shrine to cinema. Here, a DVD of Michelangelo Antonioni's ''L'Avventura'' rests beside a Super 8 camera and a clapper from his first student film, titled ''Grandma's Hands.''
''I'm proud of that film,'' Mr. Salters said, adding that he had made it as part of a 15-week training course at the Digital Film Academy in Manhattan. ''Actually, I'm amazed I pulled it off. I was in the throes of drug and alcohol addiction at the time.'' 
Mr. Salters has spent his life battling addiction. He said he first experienced it through his father, who, Mr. Salters added, was a ''full-blown alcoholic'' before he died in 1989. But he became personally acquainted with its effects while enrolled at Syracuse University, where he majored in economics. A combination of heavy drinking and student loan debt caused him to drop out before receiving his degree, he said.
After that, Mr. Salters earned his stockbroker's license and got a job on Wall Street. Over the next two decades, he worked as an operations clerk, a mutual fund specialist and a client relationship manager.
One surprising thing he discovered: on Wall Street, not everyone is rich. ''I earned less than $30,000 a year most of that time,'' he said.
He also learned that Wall Street was not the place for him. The ''work hard, play hard'' mentality exacerbated his addictions to cocaine and alcohol, he said, and he was eventually fired for what he called ''procedural errors.''
''Instead of researching mutual funds, I'd be making fliers for my R & B band,'' he said.
The birth of his daughter, Chelsea, now 22, motivated Mr. Salters to stop using drugs and alcohol. He remained clean and sober for 12 years, he said, and during that time he was married briefly and had a son, Madison, now 17.
But in 2004, Mr. Salters relapsed. It was not until two years later, after he enrolled in film school, that he decided to quit for good. He left Wall Street and joined Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous.
''Film gave me a new purpose in life,'' said Mr. Salters, who was wearing a T-shirt with the name of the Spike Lee film ''Do the Right Thing.''
Intent on writing and directing his own films one day, Mr. Salters got a job as a freelance film production assistant in 2008. Around this time, his children, who had been living with their mothers, came to live with him at his railroad apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn.
The apartment was in poor shape, however.
''We had a severe bed-bug problem,'' Mr. Salters said.
And despite having repaired his life, he found it hard to support his family on a production assistant's salary. Last summer, Mr. Salters fell behind on the rent, amassing $3,000 in arrears. His landlord slipped an eviction letter in his mailbox.
Mr. Salters sought help from New York City's Human Resources Administration, and received a one-shot infusion of $1,750 to help with this debt. He then contacted Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and received an additional $700.
Mr. Salters and his landlord negotiated a payment plan for the balance.
In November, with financial assistance from Mr. Salters's brother, he and his children relocated to a quiet, bed-bugless three-bedroom apartment in the Bronx. Madison, who said he was a ''D student'' while living in Australia with his mother, is now on the honor roll at the Academy of Urban Planning in Brooklyn. Chelsea, who is completing her senior year at the Fashion Institute of Technology, also has a sales job at Bloomingdale's and helps pay for household expenses.
Mr. Salters said his next goal was to become a truck driver for Theatrical Teamsters Local 817, an organization for union workers in the entertainment industry. He is saving money to take the New York State commercial driver's license course, which he estimates will cost around $1,200.
''I want to establish a pension and take care of my family,'' Mr. Salters said.
But he has not forgotten his dream of directing a feature film. Also on his bookshelf is a mesh baseball cap with the name of his future production company, SaltShaker FilmWerks, emblazoned in spray paint above the brim.
''It's never been worn,'' he said, smiling.

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve as a Hedge Fund: Higher Profits, Lower Pay

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff, a former corporate lawyer, is a professor at the Michael E. Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
The year 2011 is over, and soon we'll be hearing again about billion-dollar paydays for select hedge fund wizards.
If it makes you feel any better, not everyone is sharing in these riches. The people who operate the most successful hedge fund around are receiving a relative pittance.
That hedge fund is the Federal Reserve. Last year, the central bank turned over $76.9 billion in profit to the federal government, slightly down from $79.3 billion it provided in 2010. 
The Fed made this money in interest on a nearly $3 trillion portfolio of securities. This enormous holding was built up largely in the wake of the financial crisis as the Fed bought these securities through two rounds of quantitative easing.
I call the Fed a hedge fund because it is operating like one, leveraging its balance sheet to earn huge profits. The main difference between a hedge fund and the Fed is that the Fed effectively creates its own money, so it doesn't have any borrowing costs, meaning yet more profits. Remarkably, the Fed's profits are also an afterthought. The Fed is trying to stabilize and increase the United States economy in the wake of the financial crisis, and its profits are a nice byproduct.
Still, these earnings blow away any other hedge fund profits.
The Fed employees who manage this operation receive a federal salary for their efforts. The money is well above the pay of the average American but still relatively modest compared with those in the financial industry. The top salary class at the Federal Reserve has a maximum of $205,570 a year. Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, earns $199,700 a year, while the other members of the Federal Reserve board earn $179,700.
Officers of the branch banks of the Federal Reserve system earn more. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner's old position, receives $410,780. By my calculation, the 17,015 employees of the Federal Reserve received an average compensation of $87,579 in 2010.
Figures for 2011 hedge fund compensation are yet to be known, but compare the Fed's salaries with the highest paid hedge fund managers in 2010. According to AR: Absolute Return + Alpha magazine's annual list, the top 25 hedge fund managers made $22 billion, or an average of $880 million. The highest paid hedge fund manager in 2010 was John Paulson, who made $4.9 billion running a hedge fund that had about $33 billion in assets. (He is likely to make much less in 2011, with his funds falling as much as 52.5 percent last year.)
Hedge fund managers make their money from the ''2 and 20.'' Hedge funds generally charge a fee of roughly 1 to 2 percent on all assets under administration and take 20 percent of the profits. The idea is that this large cut will incentivize the hedge fund manager to earn outsize profits.
But federal employees who were paid astoundingly less made fantastically higher profits than any single hedge fund manager. The entire Fed payroll for 2010 was still less than Mr. Paulson's 2010 salary. One man made four times more than the Fed's 17,000 plus employees combined, and earned much less money.
The point is not that the federal government should go into the hedge fund business or that making money is relatively easy for the Fed. Rather, it is that these government employees did this service without demanding to be paid billions in compensation.
They are not alone. Treasury Department employees take on the similarly complicated, hedge fund-type task of supervising the economy for even lower pay than the Fed's employees.
Even outside the federal government, there are those who are not paid enormous sums to perform the most complicated financial tasks.
David F. Swensen, the chief of the Yale endowment, for example, is one of the most successful asset managers in recent history, consistently earning outsize returns and often beating the best hedge fund performers. His salary too is much less than that of the hedge fund barons. In the last few years, his salary has ranged from $3 million to $5 million a year for managing Yale's endowment, which is valued at about $20 billion.
Even so, people in private industry argue that you have to pay top dollar to get the best people and that the market demands it.
We even see this argument being made by the federal government. The regulator who oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Edward J. DeMarco, has asserted that he had to pay the top six executives at Fannie and Freddie more than $35 million in combined pay over 2009 and 2010. He said that to do otherwise would be ''irresponsible'' because it would fail to retain and attract the appropriate people. Yet, the Fannie and Freddie executives are arguably doing even less sophisticated work than the Federal Reserve employees do.
Why these executives should be paid more than Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues defies reason. This is government work now.
These disparities show that compensation, like people, is a complicated issue. People are willing to forgo earnings for prestige and other benefits like job security. And perhaps top dollar simply does not need to be as high as those in the finance industry would want you to believe.
Perhaps more interesting, the Fed pay structure may show that the work that these hedge fund barons and other titans of finance and industry perform doesn't require multimillion-dollar salaries - even when some claim that the market demands them. Perhaps they would be willing to accept lower amounts when push comes to shove.
This will happen only when the pension funds and other institutional investors recognize that a 20 percent cut of the profits paid to hedge fund managers is too much, and they push hard to lower these fees. In the private equity realm, the Institutional Limited Partners Association is leading a similar crusade, but no such movement has yet penetrated the hedge fund universe.
The Fed has unwillingly made billions, to the benefit of the United States taxpayer. The Fed and its employees have done it in a way that would make even the most ardent opponent of the Fed proud - at a low cost.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Kraft Tries an Aged Cheese Marketing Campaign

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
KRAFT FOODS is reviving a vintage marketing recipe with a campaign that promotes five Kraft cheese products together as well as separately.
The campaign, now under way, carries the theme ''Make something amazing,'' with Kraft advising consumers that they can fix outstanding meals and snacks when they use the five products: Kraft Singles, Kraft grated parmesan, Kraft shredded cheeses, Kraft Natural Slices and a newcomer, Kraft Fresh Take.
The campaign has a budget estimated at more than $50 million, which executives at Kraft Foods are calling the largest single investment in the last decade in their cheese and dairy products. The campaign, by McGarryBowen, an agency that is part of the Dentsu Network West unit of Dentsu, is another example of the resurgence in marketing efforts for packaged foods that began with the financial crisis and continues as the economy remains uncertain. 
The trend is underscored by a decision by Dannon, part of Groupe Danone, to advertise for the first time during a Super Bowl. A commercial for Dannon Oikos Greek yogurt is to appear in the third quarter of Super Bowl XLVI on Feb. 5, joining the event's longtime sponsors like Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, General Motors and PepsiCo.
''More and more people are eating at home,'' said Tim Snyder, vice president for marketing at another food giant, Mars Food, which sells brands like Uncle Ben's rice products. That led Mars Food and its agency, BBDO San Francisco, to start a campaign last year with the theme ''Begin with Ben,'' as well as start a Ben's Beginners cooking contest this week, meant to encourage parents and children to spend time together preparing meals.
ConAgra Foods recently began running commercials on 15 television networks for a venerable product, Hunt's canned tomatoes. The spots, created by the SapientNitro division of Sapient, bring a celebrity chef, George Duran, into supermarkets. And the Campbell Soup Company has been flooding magazines with ads that are part of a campaign called ''It's amazing what soup can do''; some issues carry five or six ads from the campaign.
One such Campbell's ad, featuring a recipe for a dish called Beef Taco Skillet, which is made with Campbell's tomato soup, reassures nervous cooks with the headline ''Requires: One Skillet, No Skill.''
The Campbell's ads promote a repository of recipes on a Web site, campbellskitchen.com. Likewise, the Kraft cheese campaign directs consumers to a recipe-centric Web site, kraftcheese.com, an offshoot of kraftrecipes.com.
''We're trying to invest more in our iconic brands,'' said Racquel Harris, vice president for marketing in the Kraft cheese group at the Kraft Foods office in Glenview, Ill., in order to ''amplify our emotional connection with consumers.''
The cheese campaign includes an anthemic commercial that runs 60 seconds, rather than the usual 30 seconds, to introduce the ''Make something amazing'' theme. The spot has appeared during two prominent TV events -- the People's Choice Awards, on CBS, and the Golden Globe Awards, on NBC -- and is to return on Jan. 25 to run on an episode of ''American Idol'' on Fox.
The commercial features an upbeat pop song, ''Bright Idea,'' by a Canadian band named Mother Mother. As the song plays, a wide variety of adults and children are shown having fun as they cook, eat and snack.
''At Kraft, we're stretching our cheese as far as it can go,'' an announcer declares. ''So go ahead, make something amazing.''
The campaign also includes online ads, cooking video clips on kraftcheese.com, social media, promotions in stores and coupon inserts in newspapers.
An umbrella campaign provides ''a bigger play'' by adding ''the voice of Kraft'' to the ads, said Tim Scott, president of the Chicago office of McGarryBowen, which also creates ads for Kraft Foods brands like Crystal Light, Maxwell House, Oscar Mayer and Miracle Whip.
The idea also reflects that ''most consumers have multiple cheese products in the refrigerator,'' he added.
The theme is intended to present Kraft cheeses as ''a spark of inspiration,'' Mr. Scott said, leaving it to consumers to create dishes that range ''from simple to elaborate.''
For decades, Kraft ran ads that sold several Kraft products at the same time, which ran during radio and television shows like ''Kraft Music Hall,'' ''Kraft Television Theatre'' and ''Kraft Suspense Theatre.'' Many of those commercials were voiced by the same announcer, Ed Herlihy, who promoted Kraft's ''good food and good food ideas'' from the 1940s through the 1980s.
The new cheese product that is part of the campaign, Kraft Fresh Take, is one of at least 70 that Kraft Foods plans to bring out in 2012. Others include belVita Breakfast biscuits, Kraft Sizzling Salads dinner kits and MilkBite bars.
The parade of new products comes as Kraft Foods prepares this year to divide into two companies, one focused on mainstay grocery staples in North America, among them Kraft cheeses, and the other on treats and candy like Cadbury and Oreo.
On Tuesday, Kraft Foods said it would prepare for the changes by consolidating offices, reorganizing sales operations and cutting 1,600 jobs in the United States and Canada.

HEADLINE: Few Cities Have Regained Jobs They Lost, Report Finds

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Less than a tenth of the nation's metropolitan areas have regained the jobs they lost in the economic downturn, according to a report being released Wednesday by the nation's mayors as they gather in Washington to express their exasperation that the federal government seems more intent on cutting aid to cities than on sending more.
Only 26 of the nation's 363 metropolitan areas had recovered their lost jobs by the end of 2011, and only 26 more are projected to recover them by end of this year, according to the report, which was commissioned by the United States Conference of Mayors. It will take at least five years for the 80 hardest-hit areas to recover the jobs they lost, the report forecast. 
Households in metropolitan areas experienced a 2.2 percent decline in median income from 2009 to 2010, it found, while those in rural areas did not see a statistically significant decline. And the report said that housing prices fell by 4 percent in 2011, sapping household wealth and further shrinking the property tax base that many cities rely on.
But the lingering economic crisis has failed to spur any meaningful recent action in Washington, mayors said in interviews.
''We're looking for a partnership with the Congress to put America back to work,'' Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles, a Democrat who is the president of the mayors' group, said in an interview. ''We're looking for the Congress to do its job. If we were to grade the 112th Congress, I think you'd have to say the midterm report card grade would be very clear: an F for failure.''
Not only has Congress failed to overcome partisan gridlock to agree on a way to created much-needed jobs by spending more money on infrastructure, mayors said, but even the small sources of federal support that cities rely on -- whether the Community Development Block Grants that were devised by Republican administrations in the 1970s or more recent federal programs that help struggling cities pay for more police officers or firefighters -- are being scaled back as Washington has made cutting the deficit a priority.
The resulting frustration cuts across party lines. Asked how Washington had responded to the slow and uneven recovery, Mayor Scott Smith of Mesa, Ariz., a Republican, answered the question with a question. ''What have they done?'' he asked.
He said that Mesa depended on its shrinking share of federal block grants to help pay for important local needs, including a shelter that cares for homeless men, some of whom are veterans.
''Whether Congress funds us or doesn't fund us, we still have a homeless vet on the street that has to be cared for; we can't ignore the problem,'' Mr. Smith said. ''I'm a Republican, and I'm not generally in favor of a lot of federal spending, but I believe that if there's a homeless vet on the street that the federal government shares some of that responsibility and some of that burden. Simply because they reduce the budget doesn't mean the cost goes away.''
The report commissioned by the mayors, which was prepared by IHS Global Insight, said that even as the recovery continued to take hold there was an ''uncomfortably high'' 30 percent chance that the United States could slide back into recession.
And it said that two of the biggest risks were very much out of the hands of cities: the crisis in Europe and federal budget policy. This year, the report estimated, federal, state and local spending will decline by 2.5 percent, which would lower the nation's gross domestic product by half a percentage point.
Some mayors have known only fiscal crisis.
''I've been mayor for three years now, and all I've known is an environment of cuts and significant deficits,'' said Mayor Ashley Swearengin of Fresno, Calif., a Republican. Fresno has cut about 800 jobs through layoffs and attrition, and the area's unemployment rate remained at 15.7 percent in November.
Though they fear that there will be little action in a presidential election year, mayors said that they hoped Congress could at least be persuaded to pass a long-term transportation bill at last -- something that has traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support but that has been a flashpoint in recent years. At a minimum, they said, they hope Congress will avoid more painful cuts.
Mayor James Brainard of Carmel, Ind., a Republican, said that the country must get to a point where it spends less than it collects in revenues, but that it must be done over years, carefully.
''We have to recognize that it can't be done in one year without throwing us into a huge, much worse depression than we've had,'' he said. ''It needs to be a multiyear plan that doesn't create terrible hardship.''

HEADLINE: Rally Fades On Earnings At Citigroup

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks on Wall Street advanced Tuesday but pared gains after Citigroup's steep drop in profit gave investors a reason to unload bank shares.
The late-day sell-off reflected a reversal in prevailing sentiment, when earlier optimism about the economy and China's growth prospects drove the major stock indexes up about 1 percent. 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 0.5 percent to 12,482.07, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 0.4 percent, to 1,293.67 The Nasdaq composite index was up 0.6 percent to 2,728.08.
Across the Atlantic, the FTSE 100 in London added 0.7 percent.
The financial sector took a hit from investors' disappointment with Citigroup's earnings. Citigroup's stock slid 8 percent to a session low at $28.16 after the bank reported weaker-than-expected earnings. The KBW Banks Index lost 1.4 percent.
Citigroup's results followed similarly disappointing earnings on Friday from JPMorgan Chase.
''It was expected that some of the big banks would continue struggling, especially those heavily involved in investment banking, because that part of the financial system has clearly slowed down,'' said Bryant Evans, investment adviser and portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management in Champaign, Ill.
Earlier in the day, stocks rallied about 1 percent after data showed China's economy expanded at the weakest pace in two and a half years, suggesting that officials may try to increase growth in the near term by tweaking monetary policy.
The news followed the widely expected announcement late Friday by Standard & Poor's that it was downgrading the credit ratings of nine euro zone countries.
Also Tuesday, Wells Fargo posted a 20 percent jump in quarterly profit. Wells Fargo's stock, which earlier had risen to a session high at $30.69, pulled back sharply and was up just 0.7 percent at the close.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 4/32, to 101 9/32. The yield fell to 1.86 percent, from 1.87 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Industry Weighs Effect of Ship Accident

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Shares of the Carnival Corporation, the world's largest cruise ship operator, fell 14 percent on Tuesday as analysts and investors sought to gauge the effect of the grounding of Carnival's Costa Concordia after days of continual images and videos of the listing ship.
The death toll from the accident on Friday was 11, though at least 24 people were still missing after the ship, carrying 4,200 passengers and crew members, hit rocks and capsized hundreds of feet off Giglio Island, in Italy. 
Shares of Carnival fell $4.68, to $29.60 on Tuesday in New York. That followed a similar drop in London the previous day, when markets in the United States were closed for Martin Luther King's Birthday.
Carnival, which is based in Miami and London, owns 101 cruise ships and has 85,000 employees around the world.
Analysts said the accident could not have happened at a worse time for the industry, which carries more than 13 million passengers each year. January is the beginning of the so-called wave season, a period when cruise lines typically book a third to half of their reservations for the entire year.
Cruise companies were hoping for a rebound this year after a sluggish season last year because of the slow global economy and high fuel prices. Still, the cruise industry was not expecting to see much growth, even before the accident, according to a report Sunday by Standard & Poor's.
Gregory Badishkanian, an analyst at Citigroup, said he had seen indications of a 6 to 10 percent decline in cruise bookings after the tragedy.
''The pictures and the videos from the Costa tragedy are more graphic and widespread than past incidents,'' he said in a note to investors. But he added that such volatility was not unexpected.
While cruise operators froze their advertising over the weekend, analysts and travel agents said the industry was not likely to suffer long-term consequences despite the effect of the images.
''There is no major passenger fear of cruising thus far,'' Mr. Badishkanian said.
Neil Gorfain, the chief executive of the Cruise Outlet, an online national booking agency that specializes in cruises, said he had not seen any cancellations. ''The public has a short memory. We might have some concern for a few weeks. But so far, we have had no fallout.''
The effect on the Carnival Corporation is harder to gauge at this point, although it has the wherewithal to shoulder the financial cost of the accident.
On Monday, Carnival said that its lost earnings this year from the grounding of the Costa Concordia would be $85 million to $95 million. It also anticipated ''other costs to the business that are not possible to determine at this time,'' which might include future cancellations, for instance, or possible liabilities. In addition, the company said it might have to pay $30 million in deductibles to cover damage to the ship, and a $10 million deductible for personal injury liability and cleanup costs.
The cost to insurers, on the other hand, might be substantial, depending on the vessel's fate.
One analyst with Numis Securities in London has estimated total liability at $800 million if the ship were scrapped. This would make it the largest marine loss on record, exceeding the $500 million that insurers paid after the 1989 grounding of the Exxon Valdezoil tanker in Alaska, according to a report by Bloomberg News. The ship is insured by a group of firms, including Assicurazioni Generali, the RSA Insurance Group and the XL Group, it said.
Carnival was founded in 1972 by Ted Arison, with a single ship sailing between Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico. The company is now run by the founder's son, Micky, and carries eight million passengers a year, 60 percent of them from the United States, on cruises throughout the world.
Carnival, which has twice as many ships and employees as the second-largest cruise line operator, Royal Caribbean Cruises, reported revenues of $14.5 billion in its 2010 fiscal year.
Under Micky Arison, the company has been one of the top drivers of the industry's consolidation in the last decade. It now owns 10 brands, including the Carnival Cruise Lines, its largest subsidiary with 23 ships; Princess Cruises; and the Holland American Line. Its other subsidiaries include P&O Cruises and Cunard.
Its Costa Cruises unit has 15 ships that operate mainly in Europe, and account for 16 percent of Carnival's global capacity. The company has 10 ships on order, including two planned for Costa.
So far, Mr. Arison, who also owns the Miami Heat of the N.B.A., has taken a low-key position, allowing the head of his Italian subsidiary to handle the accident's fallout. That executive, Pier Luigi Foschi, has blamed the ship's captain for performing an unauthorized maneuver.
Public comments on cruise-related Web sites offered a mixed picture. One commenter on CruiseCritic.com, Christine Crossingham, said the accident had not dented her enthusiasm to board the MSC Fantasia, of Italy's MSC Cruises, in March. It is one of the world's largest ships with nearly 300,000 square feet of public space.
''This is evidently human error,'' she wrote. ''There are thousands of cruises going every day out somewhere.''
Another, Ralph Summers, said he would not cruise the Mediterranean Sea. ''I'll stick to the Caribbean thank you.''

HEADLINE: Technology Helps Sundance Films Capture the Moment

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- If the Sundance Film Festival is a mirror of America, this year's installment depicts an unusually stark image of a broken place filled with broken people.
Documentaries examine the nation's collapsed manufacturing base, its damaged health care system, a looming hunger crisis among the American poor, an epidemic of rape in the United States military, the American dream turned nightmare and the disastrous state of the government's war on drugs.
Narrative entries look at financial fraud and corporate greed, unhappy young adults trying to push the reboot button on their lives and the broader theme of moral decay. ''A midlife crisis as a country'' is how Trevor Groth, director of programming for Sundance, sums up the dominant thematic current of this year's festival, which starts on Thursday in Park City, Utah.
Independent film has always had a bleak streak: a desire to tell complicated stories that don't end with everyone smiling is part of what sparked the indie movement (now pushing 40) in the first place. Perhaps the abnormally uniform mood of this year's lineup is simply a reflection of how difficult the last few years have been, with two wars and a brutal recession representing just the most obvious aspects of the problem. 
But festival organizers, including Robert Redford, Sundance's founder, wonder if other forces are at play here, namely technology and a faster pace of filmmaking.
Yes, Sundance has always reflected contemporary society, but the view is usually blurrier than people (especially reporters looking for trends) want to admit, or at least more outdated. Historically, because Sundance films have roughly had a gestation time of three to five years, chances were high that the cultural moment they were examining had already faded.
That has now changed. Because of advances in digital moviemaking, a notable number of this year's selections took less than a year and a half to come together. Some of the entries this year, using the latest gadgets and stripped of studio bureaucracy and complex scheduling requirements, took only four months or so to be made.
''If ever there was a crucial time for a hard, honest look at our country, it's now -- it's no secret that we're at the bottom of a very dark barrel -- and the speed with which films can now be made is greatly helping artists to do just that,'' Mr. Redford said.
John Cooper, Sundance's director, also pointed to the speed of digital filmmaking tools, particularly home editing equipment, as having noticeably changed the festival.
''After 9/11 we didn't start seeing films reacting to it until a few years later,'' he said. ''But even when the recession hit a few years after that, you felt the impact of it more quickly. From a programming perspective, we feel more tuned in to how people are feeling right now than we ever have before.''
Mr. Groth and Mr. Cooper both say that no efforts are made to mold the festival around certain themes; whatever emerges emerges. Both also insist that there is no political agenda at work in this election year (although critics of the left-leaning festival probably believe otherwise). But they do see Sundance's role as cultural examiner as extremely important.
''Part of the reason that independent film is so important as an art form involves the special insight it gives us into America,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''Who are we? The honest answers are certainly not coming from television or mainstream movies.''
Sundance, which runs through Jan. 29 and showcases more than 100 feature films, sets the tone for this corner of cinema for the year to come because it functions as a bazaar for distribution companies. Last year more than 40 films were purchased, among the most ever (official records don't exist), some of which are still unspooling in theaters. ''Sing Your Song,'' a documentary about Harry Belafonte shown at last year's festival, was released only last weekend.
There is, of course, a wide variety of films at this year's festival that center on subjects that are happy, or at least less sobering. Julie Delpy's ''2 Days in New York,'' a follow-up to her 2007 critical hit ''2 Days in Paris,'' is a witty romp co-starring Chris Rock. ''The First Time'' is a funny story of two teenagers falling in love. (It is being shopped by John Sloss, the New York-based sales agent who sold ''Little Miss Sunshine'' to Fox Searchlight for $10.5 million in 2006, still the festival record.)
Sales agents like happy themes, which are generally more palatable to a broad audience. But sellers are also optimistic about some of this year's grittier selections because they are so topical.
''Moviegoers can really identify with these problems,'' said Jay Cohen, a partner at the Gersh Agency. ''Everybody in the world is trying to figure out who they are right now.''
Going by Sundance's official program, which includes detailed summaries of the selected films, at least eight fall squarely into the category of ''America is broken.'' The most high-profile may be ''The Queen of Versailles,'' a documentary directed by Lauren Greenfield that looks at a Florida developer's attempt to build a 90,000-square-foot home. (It has already spawned a defamation lawsuit.) ''The House I Live In,'' directed by Eugene Jarecki, who won Sundance's grand jury prize in 2005 for his military documentary ''Why We Fight,'' tackles the failed war on drugs.
''I see a lot of movies in this year's festival that aren't made to be crowd pleasers but are instead made to say something about the moment,'' said Tom Bernard, the co-president of Sony Pictures Classics and a longtime festival attendee.
Four films gaze intensely at corporate greed, including ''Arbitrage,'' a thriller directed by Nicholas Jarecki (brother of Eugene) that stars Richard Gere as a billionaire hedge fund manager whose empire collapses because of fraud. At least 14 selections look at moral decay, among them ''The Comedy,'' directed by Rick Alverson, a tale of hipsters who act like spoiled children. Mr. Groth described it as ''a camouflaged assault on contemporary culture'' and ''a carefully rendered cautionary fable for the autumn of America.''
Many movies, about 25, look at 30-somethings whose lives have come apart for one reason or another -- divorce, drugs, depression -- and who are trying to get back on track. Many are not as depressing as they might have been, with filmmakers tackling the topic through comedy and warm drama.
''Smashed,'' directed by James Ponsoldt, stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Aaron Paul and Octavia Spencer in a story about what happens to a marriage of two alcoholics when one tries to get sober. The drama ''Nobody Walks,'' directed by Ry Russo-Young, stars John Krasinski, Olivia Thirlby and Rosemarie DeWitt and looks at a liberal Los Angeles family's unraveling.
Super Crispy Entertainment, a production company backed by Zygmunt Wilf, the principal owner of the Minnesota Vikings, and his wife, Audrey, produced both of those films, along with ''Like Crazy,'' a darling of last year's festival. ''Smashed'' had roughly a four-month turnaround from when the money started flowing and the film was completed, according to Jonathan Schwartz, one of Super Crispy's principals. ''Nobody Walks'' also came together in a matter of months.
''That kind of timeline is outrageous,'' he said, ''but we were able to do it because editing software lets us work at home and around the clock.''

HEADLINE: Preaching Division in South Carolina

 BODY:
By mixing falsehoods with racial condescension, Newt Gingrich brought a raucous presidential debate crowd to its feet on Monday night in South Carolina, further cheapening his reputation and that of the state Republican Party.
For months, Mr. Gingrich has made racial resentment an integral part of his platform as a conservative challenger to Mitt Romney. He has traversed the country calling President Obama ''the greatest food-stamp president in American history'' and presenting African-Americans with the great revelation that they should prefer paychecks to federal handouts. When he was called on it at the debate by Juan Williams of Fox News, he took the measure of the crowd and doubled down.
''The fact is that more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history,'' he announced, to wild cheers. ''I know among the politically correct, you're not supposed to use facts that are uncomfortable.'' What you're not supposed to do, actually, is mislead the public. 
The fact is that Mr. Obama has ''put'' no one on food stamps. People apply for food assistance, known officially as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, because they're poor or out of work and their families are hungry. The number of people using the program, which is now at a peak, began rising with the recession, in 2007, and continued through four of the toughest years ever faced by the poor and near-poor in modern history. Mr. Obama eased the eligibility requirements as part of his stimulus program, a desperately needed measure that helped struggling families and the economy.
Non-Hispanic whites also far outnumber blacks receiving SNAP benefits. As for the notion that these are people who somehow like their dependency, 30 percent of SNAP households have income from work -- a reminder of the brutal impact of the recession on wages.
But these are inconvenient details to Mr. Gingrich, who implied that the rise in federal aid was a sad indication of the insufficient work ethic of black Americans.
If only they were more willing to be janitors! Asked by Mr. Williams why he has frequently suggested that poor children be employed as school janitors, Mr. Gingrich said his daughter worked as a church janitor at age 13 and liked earning the money and that it would be a good way for poor students to learn the value of work. But, he suggested, Mr. Obama doesn't want them to work at all because liberal elites prefer to ''maximize dependency.''
Don't try to follow any kind of logical thread of why the president wouldn't want the jobless rate to decrease; there isn't one. This trumpet was sounded to feed the prejudice of people who already believe that blacks and other poor people don't really like to work and to deflect the growing public awareness that the Republican Party's highest priority is protecting the rich from higher taxes.
For these divisive thoughts, Mr. Gingrich earned his ovation and Mr. Williams won a round of boos. Rick Santorum also got in on the game, responding to a question about high rates of black poverty with a lecture on the importance of work, high school graduation and marriage. Unfortunately, he said, the Obama administration refuses to encourage those kinds of good choices.
In South Carolina, where a Confederate flag still waves on the front lawn of the State Capitol largely because of the efforts of the state Republican Party, it remains good primary politics to stir up racial animosity and then link it to President Obama. Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Santorum and the crowd that cheered them are following in a long and tawdry tradition, singling out a minority group for lectures while refusing to support policies that help all Americans.

HEADLINE: Hunting, Dear Sir? Delighted!

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
CHARLESTON, S.C.
Watching Mitt Romney in the Myrtle Beach debate gave me acid flashbacks to Poppy Bush.
Maybe it was when Mittens decorously noted, in front of the raucous, bloodthirsty South Carolina crowd: ''When I get invited, I'm delighted to be able to go hunting.''
Maybe it was Romney sounding all 19th century recounting his sharp right turn on abortion as governor of Massachusetts: ''I penned an op-ed in The Boston Globe and said I am pro-life.'' 
Maybe it was when Rick Santorum pushed the front-runner to justify an attack ad financed by his ''super PAC'' and Romney gazed at Santorum the way a C.E.O. regards an impudent mailroom clerk. ''We have plenty of time,'' Mitt instructed him with a tight smile, looking as though he wanted to give him a copy of ''Tiffany's Table Manners for Teenagers.'' ''I'll get there. I'll do it in the order I want to.'' Mitt would probably be asking for ''a splash'' more coffee at a truck stop if he drank coffee.
Poppy is an Episcopalian East Coast patrician, and Mitt is a Mormon Midwest patrician; their fathers were both archetypal moderate Republicans.
Poppy drinks martinis; Mitt drinks chocolate milk and Coke Zero. But 41 and the man he endorsed to be 45 share the gee-whiz language, hokey humor, awkward stage presence, sense of entitlement and noblesse oblige, need to break away from powerful patriarchs and prove themselves in business, gentlemanly demeanor that masks surprisingly sharp elbows, and the willingness to make whiplash switches from blue-blooded positions to red-state ones, leaving everyone to wonder: ''Who is this guy at his core?''
It's easy to picture Poppy and Mitt sitting in a wood-paneled room in a country club, chatting about tennis, Marquess of Queensberry rules and how they're above being gutter fighters like the Clintons (except when they aren't). Poppy was compared by some to Chatsworth Osborne Jr., the rich kid on ''Dobie Gillis,'' and Mitt was compared by some to Thurston Howell III, the millionaire on ''Gilligan's Island.''
Twenty-four years ago, David Letterman did a ''Top Ten Ways to Make George Bush More Exciting.'' (''Shorter speeches, tighter pants.'') Last year, Romney went on Letterman's show to read ''Things You Don't Know About Mitt Romney,'' including: ''I'm the guy in the photo that comes with your picture frame.''
Their political philosophies were not shaped by a passion for ideas as much as a desire to serve and an ambition to climb higher than their revered fathers. Pragmatism trumps ideology; survival trumps conviction. Both men, to the manner born in Greenwich and Bloomfield Hills, adapted uncomfortably to the fundamentalist tent meeting mood of the modern G.O.P., knowing their futures depended on Faustian deals with the right.
Poppy went from denouncing ''voodoo economics'' to embracing it as Reagan's vice president. ''He understands,'' a friend explained, ''that you have to do politically prudent things to get in a position to do what's right.''
Worried that a platform of mere civic duty would not suffice to stir the emotions of voters, Poppy and Mitt waved the flag and demonized opponents with ethnic names as less American. Bush senior toured a flag factory and said the Pledge of Allegiance at every campaign stop; Romney parses patriotic songs and his advisers refer to Mormonism as ''the most American of religions.'' Just as the Ivy League Poppy mocked Michael Dukakis for being a member of the ''Harvard boutique,'' so Harvard grad Romney makes fun of President Obama as an elitist from ''the Harvard faculty lounge.'' It's like watching little boys in Topsiders act all gangsta.
Bush 41 went from supporting Planned Parenthood to declaring at his first debate with Dukakis that abortion was a crime that might need penalties. Romney went from being a passionate supporter of abortion rights who appeared at a fund-raiser for Planned Parenthood and endorsed the legalization of RU-486 to being ''firmly pro-life.''
What the late Republican Senator Mark Hatfield said of the resentment-stoking, red-meat-throwing H.W. in 1988 could apply to Romney now: ''If his father were alive, I'm sure his father would see it as a shocking transformation.''
Mitt and Poppy sacrificed authenticity but never inspired Reaganesque passion. When Romney went in and out of his hotel here this week, the Charleston Place, he passed a blue El Dorado Cadillac in the parking lot with a new bumper sticker reading: ''Reagan for President.''
On Fox News on Tuesday, Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said that if Romney wants a big victory here Saturday, he will have to ''let his hair down a little bit'' and show his heart. (Does anybody really want to see that?) Many conservatives here don't trust Romney to stay conservative if he becomes president. What if he began to think it's his civic duty to cut the deficit by raising taxes, like Poppy? What if he flips back from his flops?
Who are these guys at their core?

HEADLINE: Risks for G.O.P. in Attacks With Racial Themes

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting from Florence, S.C.

 BODY:
CHARLESTON, S.C. -- South Carolina has the nation's first female Indian-American governor (a Republican), the highest-ranking African-American in Congress (on the Democratic side) and a rapidly growing population of Latinos, all evidence, longtime political players here say, that the state is shedding its racially charged past.
But like the historic slave plantations that draw tourists on the outskirts of town, the legacy of that past has not been totally wiped from the politics of today. And if the general election campaign by Republicans against President Obama, the nation's first black president, goes on to include a fraught, multilayered discussion about minorities and entitlements, work ethics and what it means to be American, then it will have gotten under way in earnest here this week. 
So it was that on Tuesday Newt Gingrich gleefully said his description of Mr. Obama as a ''food stamp president'' at Monday's Fox News debate had ''struck a chord with the American people''; the White House press secretary asserted that it was ''crazy'' to say so, and then Mr. Gingrich doubled down -- releasing an ad with his debate-night assertion that ''more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history.''
Mr. Gingrich was clearly making the case that he is the candidate most able to take the fight to Mr. Obama in the fall, but he was also laying bare risks for his party when it comes to invoking arguments perceived to carry racial themes or other value-laden attack lines.
Mr. Gingrich has been engaging in such arguments here and there for the past couple of weeks, as has Rick Santorum, who found himself in the middle of a tortured debate in Iowa several weeks ago over whether he had said he did not want to make ''black people's'' lives better ''by giving them somebody else's money.'' (He said he misspoke and was misquoted as referring to ''black people'' when in fact he had meant to say, simply, ''people,'' but stumbled and also uttered ''blah.'') Mitt Romney, who regularly says Mr. Obama wants to create an ''entitlement society,'' often suggests that the election is about saving ''the soul of America.''
But it took a Republican debate in South Carolina on Martin Luther King's Birthday and an African-American debate moderator for the Fox News Channel, Juan Williams, to bring it all together for a national audience in a state that has tended to make issues of race, religion and class central for both parties. Pressing Mr. Gingrich specifically at the Myrtle Beach Convention Center on Monday night, Mr. Williams asked Mr. Gingrich if his comments calling Mr. Obama a food stamp president were not potentially belittling to black people.
Mr. Williams was channeling the view of Democratic African-American stalwarts like Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, who likened the approach on Tuesday to a modern version of the Republican ''Southern strategy'' to win over disaffected white voters in the South when the Democrats embraced the civil rights movement.
''It tends to equate the president of the United States with dependency, with a lack of status, or tends to try to lower the president,'' Mr. Clyburn said in an interview. ''And I believe it's another way to separate his presidency from the presidencies of all the others before him.''
Yet Mr. Gingrich spoke for many Republicans who have publicly worried that Mr. Obama's supporters will unfairly cast necessary policy arguments in terms of race. As Mr. Gingrich said in the debate, ''I know among the politically correct, you're not supposed to use facts that are uncomfortable.''
In an interview, Mr. Williams said he questioned Mr. Gingrich about his ''food stamp president'' comments and his suggestions that poor children lacked a work ethic and should be put to work as janitors because he found the remarks to be ''racially charged.''
''That's more than a dog whistle,'' Mr. Williams said. ''It's a hoot and a holler.''
Mr. Williams added, ''I think there is a real issue here for Republicans.''
Mr. Gingrich drew a standing ovation when he responded that a historically high number of Americans were on food stamps under Mr. Obama, and defiantly declared, ''I believe every American of every background has been endowed by their creator with the right to pursue happiness, and if that makes liberals unhappy, I'm going to continue to find ways to help poor people learn how to get a job, learn how to get a better job and learn someday to own the job.''
Mr. Gingrich is correct that food stamp program participation is at record levels but he ignores the depth of the recession inherited by Mr. Obama when he took office.
Some Republicans here, while not necessarily embracing Mr. Gingrich's language, said his reception at the debate showed that voters were ready to have a substantive discussion about minorities and entitlement programs without getting tied up in the enduring legacy of racial injustice.
''If anything, they're the ones who are race baiting,'' said Glenn McCall, the South Carolina committeeman to the Republican National Committee, who is African-American, speaking of liberals. Noting that the economic hardship is disproportionately falling upon ''people of color -- my people,'' he said, ''I wish they would hold the president's feet to the fire in the black caucus to do more -- not through handouts but in ways that lift people up.''
Former Gov. Jim Hodges, a Democrat, said it was an old-fashioned debate that will not engage voters. ''Years ago you would hear those sorts of discussions, but I've got to say that was a long time ago,'' Mr. Hodges said. ''If we've seen anything from recent history it is that voters -- whether Republican or Democratic voters in our state -- want to hear about how we're going to make their lives better.''

HEADLINE: Since 1980s, The Kindest Of Tax Cuts For the Rich

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
The effective federal income tax rate paid by the wealthiest Americans has dropped significantly during the last several decades, largely because of tax cuts on investment income.
The last major overhaul of the tax code, signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986, set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages, with both topping out at 28 percent. But that link was uncoupled by his successor, President George Bush, and the rates on capital gains were reduced by President Bill Clinton. President George W. Bush then lowered the rates on capital gains and dividends to a high of 15 percent -- less than half the 35 percent top rate on ordinary income.
While rates for all American taxpayers have fallen to near 50-year lows, the wealthy have reaped the most savings from the changes because they derive a larger proportion of their income from investments. 
Between 1985 and 2008, the wealthiest 400 Americans saw the percentage of their income paid in federal income taxes drop from 29 percent to 18 percent, according to data from the Internal Revenue Service.
Some economists say the cuts are necessary to keep capital from fleeing the United States to lower-tax countries. Scott A. Hodge, president of the conservative Tax Foundation, has written extensively that a capital gains tax is effectively double taxation on profits that have already been taxed at the corporate level. Many investors, and political leaders in both parties, have lobbied for tax cuts on capital gains and dividends by arguing that they spur investment and, therefore, job creation.
But there is little data to support that contention: the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service issued a report last year concluding that tax cuts on capital gains reduce federal revenues and do little to stimulate economic growth. And as income inequality and tax fairness have become major concerns for many Americans, the issue of tax fairness has brought calls to alter the tax code's preferential treatment of investment income.
One outspoken critic has been Warren E. Buffett, a billionaire himself. Mr. Buffett stirred debate about the issue last year when he wrote an opinion article for The New York Times stating that the low rates for investment income had allowed him to pay only about 17 percent of his income in federal taxes, less than the effective rate paid by his secretary or any of the other 19 workers in his office.
President Obama responded to the outcry by proposing the ''Buffett Rule,'' which would stipulate that those earning more than $1 million a year should pay at least the same percentage of their earnings in federal taxes that middle-income Americans did. Though estimates showed his plan would raise tens of billions of dollars a year in federal revenue, it met strong opposition from the business community and failed to win approval in Congress. Still, the idea of taxing the wealthy at a higher rate could be an issue in this year's presidential campaign.
Another point of contention is determining which investments should qualify for lower tax rates. Appreciation on stock and real assets like property has traditionally been classified as investment income because it involves investment risk on assets held for some extended period, typically at least a year. But during the last decade, hedge fund managers -- who are frequently paid 2 percent of a fund's assets annually plus 20 percent of its profits -- have also been able to pay the lower rates on their earnings. Similar rules often apply to those who manage private equity funds and other types of investments.
Hedge fund and private equity managers have argued that their tax treatment is warranted because their earnings are contingent on whether their investments make a profit. But others have characterized it as a loophole that benefits the very wealthiest Americans, and Mr. Obama and other Democrats pledged to eliminate it during the 2008 election campaign.
In 2010, when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, the effort to end the exemption for carried interest was met by a muscular lobbying campaign by investors and never made it out of committee.

HEADLINE: Iran Tightens Its Security For Scientists After Killing

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Artin Afkhami and Choe Sang-hun contributed reporting.

 BODY:
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran has ordered extra security for scientists because of the drive-by assassination last week of the deputy director of the country's primary uranium enrichment facility, which he attributed to ''the evil hands of arrogance and Zionist agents,'' the state-run news media reported Tuesday.
The nature of the extra security was not disclosed, but it was reported a day after Iran's Parliament speaker, Ali Larijani, another outspoken promoter of Iran's nuclear independence, said that investigators had identified and detained an unspecified number of suspects in the assassination of Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, the deputy director at the Natanz enrichment site. Mr. Roshan was killed in broad daylight last Wednesday by a motorcyclist who slapped a magnetized bomb on the scientist's car during Tehran's morning rush and escaped, according to Iran's official accounts. 
While the assassination method was not sophisticated, the killer's apparent knowledge of the victim and his commuting schedule seemed to reflect an intelligence lapse in Iran, where at least five scientists with connections to Iran's disputed nuclear program have been killed under mysterious circumstances since 2007.
Iran's leaders have blamed Israel and the United States for the killings, which they have characterized as part of a broader conspiracy to terrorize and bully Iran despite what they called its peaceful intentions regarding nuclear energy. The United States has categorically denied the accusation, while Israel, which considers Iran its most dangerous enemy, has been more vague.
The United States, Israel and the European Union have accused Iran of using its nuclear energy program as a pretext for developing a weapon. They have pointed to a report last November by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear monitor, which highlighted questionable Iranian actions, to bolster their case. American and European economic sanctions on Iran over the dispute, and Iran's defiance, have fed an atmosphere of increasingly tense confrontation and mistrust.
In a condolence message about Mr. Roshan's assassination released Tuesday, Mr. Ahmadinejad was quoted by Press TV, a state-run satellite channel, as saying, ''The evil hands of arrogance and Zionist agents have once again robbed Iran's scientific and academic circles of another young scientist.''
Iran's anti-Western denunciations came as the European Union and United States took new steps on Tuesday to raise the pressure. Denmark, the rotating president of the European Union, proposed that starting July 1, all countries in that body impose a full embargo of Iranian oil, Reuters reported, putting a date on that threatened step for the first time. In South Korea, a major importer of Iranian oil, a senior American diplomat, Robert J. Einhorn, urged buyers there to reduce their dependence and ''unwind their financial dealings with the Central Bank of Iran.''
A new law signed by President Obama, if fully enforced, would penalize any foreign entity that does business with the Central Bank, the primary conduit for purchases of Iran's oil, its most important export. While the law allows some leeway, it is widely seen as the most punitive step yet taken by the United States against Iran.
While Iran has said that it will never relinquish its right to enrich uranium and that any attempt to impede its oil sales will fail, it has signaled willingness to reopen suspended negotiations with the Western powers and allow inspectors from the United Nations nuclear agency to visit Iran to ask more questions. The official Islamic Republic News Agency confirmed on Tuesday that an agency team would visit Iran for three days starting on Jan. 29.

HEADLINE: Court Weighs Protections For Lawyers Of Cities

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday considered whether private lawyers hired by municipalities to conduct investigations are entitled to protections against lawsuits available to government lawyers.
In the process, the justices expressed varying views about the state of the legal marketplace and the obligations of lawyers to offer independent advice, even if it exposed them to lawsuits.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested, for instance, that no special protections were needed because ''there is a whole slew of unemployed lawyers who would be happy to take on any government service they can.'' 
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. at one point said that lawyers may not need special protection because they were required to give their best advice for any client. ''Lawyers are not supposed to be cowed by the exigencies of the situation,'' he said.
Later, though, Chief Justice Roberts expressed concern that an outside lawyer working for the government should ''do what he thinks is the right thing in this situation,'' adding: ''We don't want him to be worried about the fact that he might be sued.''
The case, Filarsky v. Delia, No. 10-1018, arose from an investigation of Nicholas B. Delia, a firefighter in Rialto, Calif., who had been suspected of improperly taking sick days. The city filmed Mr. Delia buying rolls of fiberglass insulation at a home improvement store while he was on medical leave, questioned him about the purchases and required him to retrieve the insulation from his home.
A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, determined unanimously that various city officials and the private lawyer, Steve A. Filarsky, had violated Mr. Delia's rights under the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches. But the panel dismissed the suit against the officials, saying they were protected by qualified immunity.
That doctrine shields state officials from liability for civil rights violations so long as their conduct did not violate ''clearly established'' law.
The question before the justices was whether the suit against Mr. Filarsky should also have been dismissed on qualified-immunity grounds. A majority of the justices seemed inclined to answer yes.
The main hurdle was a 1997 decision of the court, Richardson v. McKnight, which ruled that people employed by private prisons were not entitled to qualified immunity while those who worked for prisons run by the government were.
Nicole A. Saharsky, a lawyer for the federal government who argued in support of Mr. Filarsky, said the Richardson decision involved ''a fairly unique case in which the private prison was so removed from the day-to-day workings of government officials.''
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who had dissented in Richardson, said he did not see the difference. ''It's just hard to imagine anything more imbued with state action than imprisoning someone,'' he said.
Patricia A. Millett, a lawyer for Mr. Filarsky, said that lawyers must be protected from even subconscious pressures to hedge their advice and that local governments may not be able to retain good lawyers if those lawyers fear lawsuits.
Michael A. McGill, a lawyer for Mr. Delia, said it had long been the law in the Ninth Circuit that private lawyers working for the government were not entitled to qualified immunity.
Justice Antonin Scalia, the author of the dissent in Richardson, responded that ''there's a lot of bad, cowardly legal advice being given in the Ninth Circuit,'' adding: ''I don't really know that, but you don't know the opposite, either, do you?''
''I don't,'' Mr. McGill said.

HEADLINE: Parties See Few Barriers To Extending Cut in Tax

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With both parties largely in agreement on a yearlong extension of President Obama's payroll tax cut, the fight in Congress over the coming weeks will boil down to how to pay for it, and Democrats appeared to hold the advantage as members of the House returned to Washington on Tuesday.
Senior Democratic aides say they are entering the tax negotiations in a strong position after House Republicans yielded to bipartisan political pressure and passed a two-month extension of the two-percentage-point payroll tax cut just before the winter break. 
Republicans, eager to avoid another bruising fight, have signaled that they will drop the most controversial provisions in the version of the yearlong extension passed by the House earlier in December. Those include efforts to block environmental regulations on boilers and carbon emissions and to allow states to impose drug tests on recipients of unemployment benefits.
Democrats have retreated from their effort to raise taxes on incomes over $1 million to finance the extension of a tax cut for most working Americans, stave off a 27 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors and extend expiring unemployment benefits. But they do not seem ready to give much more ground.
''We feel all the concessions going forward need to come from them,'' said one senior Senate Democratic official, who requested anonymity to discuss negotiating strategy. ''We won't shy from using the political high ground.''
A senior Obama administration official, who also would speak only if not identified, said White House aides would look at ''the overall composition'' of the final package to make sure that what they saw as ''subsidies to high-income individuals and corporations'' were mitigated. That could mean ending tax breaks for corporate jets or other revenue provisions that Republicans have weighed as possibilities but have so far balked at, aides say.
Representative Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat and negotiator on the final bill, said Democrats would revive their push to raise taxes on oil and gas companies and propose a fee on banks to recoup still-unpaid costs of the Wall Street bailout.
Republicans and Democrats say passage of a yearlong extension should go smoothly, and they vowed not to have another 11th-hour crisis before the temporary extension expires at the end of February. Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, said on Tuesday that House and Senate negotiators should finish their work by the end of this month, or by the Presidents' Day break at the latest.
''It won't be easy,'' he cautioned, ''but waiting until Feb. 28 won't make it easier.''
Yet finding more than $160 billion in savings may prove more troublesome than the leaders are letting on. And that might be only a starting point. Some senior senators would like to add a raft of business tax credits that expired on Dec. 31. Those credits have been routinely extended for years but now face the headwinds of a near-record budget deficit. That could mean finding as much as $35 billion more in cuts and possibly additional revenue.
''This is going to be tougher than people think,'' Mr. Van Hollen said.
House Republican aides say they are ready to shelve the provisions that Democrats exploited politically in last month's showdown. They will not insist on measures that would allow states to require that recipients of jobless benefits undergo drug tests or show they are working to earn a high school diploma.
Democrats believe they already made a major concession when they included a provision in the two-month bill that will force the Obama administration to approve or disapprove the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast.
The largest sticking point may be Medicare. The House-passed yearlong extension would increase premiums for high-income beneficiaries and increase the number of people who would have to pay extra. About 5 percent of beneficiaries now pay higher premiums based on income. The proportion would eventually rise to 25 percent under the House bill and under a separate deficit-reduction plan proposed in September by Mr. Obama.
Senate Democrats want no part of that. They say the White House proposal came as part of a broad deficit-reduction plan that included tax increases on the wealthy. If Republicans will not make concessions on revenues, the Democrats are not going to give Republican Congressional leaders what they want most: a concession on entitlements to defang Democratic charges in the coming campaign that the Republican Party plans to dismantle the health care program for the elderly.
Three other sticking points have also emerged.
Republicans want to extend for one more year the president's two-year freeze on civilian federal employee salaries, but the president has already said he would like a 0.5 percent pay increase. Democratic aides say Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, was put on the negotiating committee to help beat back the most severe cuts to pay and benefits for federal workers, many of whom live in his state. Republicans had hoped such provisions would save $63 billion.
Republicans also want working-poor taxpayers claiming the child tax credit to provide the Internal Revenue Service their Social Security numbers, an idea that the Congressional Budget Office has said would save about $9.4 billion. Republicans say filers for the earned income credit already provide their Social Security numbers. But some Hispanic leaders are incensed about the provision, arguing that the credit -- given in the form of a check to workers who earn too little to owe federal income taxes -- is for children, not their parents, who may be illegal immigrants.
Republicans have also proposed cutting the 99 weeks of guaranteed unemployment benefits back to the traditional 59 weeks. Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats are willing to trim the duration to 79 weeks.
Such fights may mask a larger issue that has yet to surface, Congressional tax aides say. If the scope of the tax bill grows, or Democrats beat back many Republican proposals, the agreeable spending cuts may not be large enough. Under Senate rules, entirely new elements are not supposed to be included in negotiations to reconcile the differences between House and Senate bills.

HEADLINE: Op-Ed Contributor: For God So Loved The 1 Percent ...

BYLINE: By KEVIN M. KRUSE

 BODY:
Princeton, N.J.
IN recent weeks Mitt Romney has become the poster child for unchecked capitalism, a role he seems to embrace with relish. Concerns about economic equality, he told Matt Lauer of NBC, were really about class warfare.
''When you have a president encouraging the idea of dividing America based on the 99 percent versus 1 percent,'' he said, ''you have opened up a whole new wave of approach in this country which is entirely inconsistent with the concept of one nation under God.''
Mr. Romney was on to something, though perhaps not what he intended. 
The concept of ''one nation under God'' has a noble lineage, originating in Abraham Lincoln's hope at Gettysburg that ''this nation, under God, shall not perish from the earth.'' After Lincoln, however, the phrase disappeared from political discourse for decades. But it re-emerged in the mid-20th century, under a much different guise: corporate leaders and conservative clergymen deployed it to discredit Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.
During the Great Depression, the prestige of big business sank along with stock prices. Corporate leaders worked frantically to restore their public image and simultaneously roll back the ''creeping socialism'' of the welfare state. Notably, the American Liberty League, financed by corporations like DuPont and General Motors, made an aggressive case for capitalism. Most, however, dismissed its efforts as self-interested propaganda. (A Democratic Party official joked that the organization should have been called ''the American Cellophane League'' because ''first, it's a DuPont product and, second, you can see right through it.'')
Realizing that they needed to rely on others, these businessmen took a new tack: using generous financing to enlist sympathetic clergymen as their champions. After all, according to one tycoon, polls showed that, ''of all the groups in America, ministers had more to do with molding public opinion'' than any other.
The Rev. James W. Fifield, pastor of the elite First Congregational Church of Los Angeles, led the way in championing a new union of faith and free enterprise. ''The blessings of capitalism come from God,'' he wrote. ''A system that provides so much for the common good and happiness must flourish under the favor of the Almighty.''
Christianity, in Mr. Fifield's interpretation, closely resembled capitalism, as both were systems in which individuals rose or fell on their own. The welfare state, meanwhile, violated most of the Ten Commandments. It made a ''false idol'' of the federal government, encouraged Americans to covet their neighbors' possessions, stole from the wealthy and, ultimately, bore false witness by promising what it could never deliver.
Throughout the 1930s and '40s, Mr. Fifield and his allies advanced a new blend of conservative religion, economics and politics that one observer aptly anointed ''Christian libertarianism.'' Mr. Fifield distilled his ideology into a simple but powerful phrase - ''freedom under God.'' With ample support from corporate patrons and business lobbies like the United States Chamber of Commerce, his gospel of godly capitalism soon spread across the country through personal lectures, weekly radio broadcasts and a monthly magazine.
In 1951, the campaign culminated in a huge Fourth of July celebration of the theme. Former President Herbert C. Hoover and Gen. Douglas MacArthur headlined an organizing committee of conservative all-stars, including celebrities like Walt Disney and Ronald Reagan, but largely comprising business titans like Conrad Hilton, J. C. Penney, Harvey Firestone Jr. and J. Howard Pew.
In an extensive public relations campaign, they encouraged communities to commemorate Independence Day with ''freedom under God'' ceremonies, using full-page newspaper ads trumpeting the connection between faith and free enterprise. They also held a nationwide sermon contest on the theme, with clergymen competing for cash. Countless local events were promoted by a national ''Freedom Under God'' radio program, produced with the help of the filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille, hosted by Jimmy Stewart and broadcast on CBS.
Ultimately, these organizers believed that they had made a lasting impression. ''The very words 'freedom under God' have added to the vocabulary of freedom a new term,'' they boasted. Soon the entire nation would think of itself as ''under God.'' Indeed, in 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower presided over the first presidential prayer breakfast on a ''government under God'' theme and worked to promote public religiosity in a variety of ways. In 1954, as this ''under-God consciousness'' swept the nation, Congress formally added the phrase to the Pledge of Allegiance.
In the end, Mr. Romney is correct to claim that complaints about economic inequality are inconsistent with the concept of ''one nation under God.'' But that's only because the ''1 percent'' of an earlier era intended it that way.
Kevin M. Kruse, an associate professor of history at Princeton, is the author of the forthcoming ''One Nation Under God: Corporations, Christianity, and the Rise of the Religious Right.''

HEADLINE: Pressed, Romney Shares Tax Data; A Rate Near 15%

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE, DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI and ASHLEY PARKER; Kitty Bennett, Michael D. Shear and Alicia Parlapiano contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Under growing pressure from rival Republicans to release his tax returns, Mitt Romney said on Tuesday that he paid a tax rate approaching 15 percent on his millions of dollars in annual income but said he would not make public his full return until April.
His effective tax rate was ''probably closer to the 15 percent rate than anything,'' Mr. Romney said at a campaign stop in South Carolina, noting that most of his considerable income over the last decade has come from investments rather than from earned income like salary. He also characterized as ''not very much'' the $374,327 he reported earning in speaking fees last year, though that sum would, by itself, very nearly catapult most American families into the top 1 percent of the country's earners.
Mr. Romney mentioned the 15 percent figure in response to a question at a news conference, leaving uncertain whether his comment was unplanned or a deliberate effort to begin airing the issue ahead of a general election campaign. But his remarks on Tuesday drew immediate criticism from the Obama administration and Republican rivals, and are likely to cement Mr. Romney's place as an unwilling emblem of the intensifying national debate over taxation and income inequality, which burst into the campaign this month when rival candidates began attacking Mr. Romney's career in the leveraged buyout business. 
Mr. Romney's admission left unclear -- and his campaign declined to clarify -- whether the 15 percent he was referring to represented his overall tax burden or simply his federal income taxes. That makes it hard to compare the figure with the tax burdens of a typical middle-class American -- or of Mr. Romney's opponents. President Obama reported paying an effective federal tax rate of 26 percent on his 2010 family income.
But in acknowledging that most of his income comes from investments, Mr. Romney underscored a fact likely to figure prominently in attacks from Mr. Obama and other Democrats in the coming months: He is among the small percentage of very wealthy Americans who have benefited enormously from shifts in federal tax policy that have pushed federal tax rates on investment income well below the top 35 percent rate for wages and salaries, which constitute most earnings for the vast majority of people.
''The low taxes on capital gains and dividends are why people who make a ton of money, which is largely from investment income, do awfully well,'' said Robert McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice, which advocates more progressive taxation. ''The Warren Buffetts, the hedge fund managers -- they pay really low tax rates.''
Indeed, Mr. Romney probably pays a lower overall rate than many other wealthy Americans. They typically take home more ordinary income from salaries and wages than does Mr. Romney, who left Bain Capital in 1999 and joked to a group of voters last year that he was ''unemployed.''
Like other people who amass great wealth at hedge funds or private equity firms, Mr. Romney earned much of his money at Bain in the form of ''carried interest,'' a share of the profits earned by investors in Bain funds, which current federal rules treat as long-term capital gains taxed at a 15 percent rate. A significant portion of his family's wealth remains locked up in Bain funds, from which the Romneys draw income on their own investments with the firm, as well as a share of Bain's profits. The Romneys also derive significant income from other investments and mutual funds.
During 2010 and the first nine months of 2011, the Romney family had at least $9.6 million in income, according to a financial disclosure filed in August, and possibly much more.
Democrats have been calling on Mr. Romney to release his tax returns since early December. But it was criticism in recent days from fellow Republican presidential candidates, including Newt Gingrich and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, that seemed to jar Mr. Romney, who during Monday night's debate suggested he would be open to releasing his returns in April without promising to do so.
That answer provoked a fresh attack from Mr. Gingrich on Tuesday morning, when he suggested that Mr. Romney might be hiding something from voters in South Carolina.
''If you're a South Carolinian, you say, 'Wait a second, why don't you want me to know about it? Why are you going to wait until after I've voted?' '' Mr. Gingrich said during a television interview on Tuesday.
Democrats, meanwhile, redoubled their attacks on Mr. Romney as out of touch with the economic concerns of the middle class.
''We won't be waiting until he reveals his returns in April to remind voters that Romney's tax policy would keep taxes low for millionaires like himself, putting a burden on the middle class,'' said Bill Burton, a spokesman for Priorities USA Action, a ''super PAC'' supporting Mr. Obama.
At the White House on Tuesday, President Obama's spokesman said Mr. Romney's acknowledgment that he paid a 15 percent tax rate underscored an unfairness in the tax code that Mr. Obama was concerned about.
''This only illuminates what he believes is an issue, which is that everybody who's working hard ought to pay their fair share,'' said Jay Carney, the spokesman. ''That includes millionaires who might be paying an effective tax rate of 15 percent when folks making $50,000 or $75,000 or $100,000 a year are paying much more.''
Mr. Gingrich, who has criticized Mr. Romney's work at Bain for causing plant closings and layoffs, has called on Mr. Romney to release his tax returns and has pledged to release his own returns this week. Mr. Perry has been urging Mr. Romney to release his returns since October, when he released his own most recent return.
President Obama's tax return for 2010 showed he and his wife, Michelle, earned $1,728,096 in that year, most of which came from the sale of Mr. Obama's books, including ''The Audacity of Hope.'' The couple, who filed jointly, paid $453,770 in federal taxes and got a refund of $12,334.
Even among presidential candidates, a typically a well-to-do group, Mr. Romney stands out: His fortune of between $190 million and $250 million makes him one of the wealthiest men to run for president in modern times.
His income during the last decade has included millions of dollars from Bain Capital, which has continued to pay Mr. Romney a share of the firm's corporate buyout and investment profits since he left the firm. That income, too, would likely be taxed at 15 percent, because of federal regulations that treat fees to private equity and hedge fund managers as investment income.
As a candidate, Mr. Romney has also advocated tax policies that would significantly benefit people who, like him, derive most of their income from investments.
Assuming Congress does not act to extend the Bush-era tax cuts, the rate for capital gains income is set to return to 20 percent for the 2013 tax year, while the rate for dividend income will jump to 39.6 percent. But in his economic plan, Mr. Romney calls for making permanent the Bush-era tax cuts on capital gains and dividend income, keeping them both at the current rate of 15 percent.

GRAPHIC: CHART: Effective Income Tax Rates: While the top marginal tax rate on ordinary income is 35 percent, the average rates the wealthy pay are much lower. Much of their earnings come from capital gains, interest and dividends, which are taxed at 15 percent. And because only income up to $106,800 is subject to the payroll tax, they pay lower effective rates than those who earn less. (Source: Congressional Budget Office, 2007 data) (A12)

HEADLINE: The History Of Capital Gains Taxes

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Current low rates are a Bush-era innovation. 

 BODY:
Here's how Romney's low taxes will be defended by smarter conservatives (the less smart ones will just shout "class warfare"): they'll claim that there are compelling reasons to have low taxes on capital gains, and that there is therefore nothing wrong with having very high-income people paying lower tax rates than the middle class. David Frum offers a good example. 
But Frum slips a fast one by us -- and probably by himself, since he's usually pretty honest in his reasoning. He declares that 
The lower tax rate for capital gains is good policy-a policy that the US has followed almost from the inception of the income tax, a policy followed by almost every other advanced economy on earth (including some that don't tax capital gains at all).
This conveys the impression that the current very low rates of capital gains taxation are the way it has always been. But that's not at all true. Here's the reality:
Source.
The current very low rates didn't happen until 2003; in fact, long-term capital gains were taxed at close to 30 percent from 1986 through 1997, when Clinton cut a deal with Republicans to get an expanded earned-income tax credit. And dividend income also only started receiving privileged status in 2003.
So nothing in our history or experience says that unearned income has to be taxed this lightly. It's not a time-honored principle; it's a Bush-era innovation, pushed through the Senate, by the way, using reconciliation.

HEADLINE: A 'Matchmaker' for Drivers and Parking Spaces

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: ParkatmyHouse aims to create an online marketplace for parking spaces in the United States. 

 BODY:
We've all been in this situation: You drive to an important appointment in the city -- or a big outing, say, at a sports arena -- and waste precious time frantically looking for a parking spot that won't cost you a day's wages.
ParkatmyHouse, an online service that began in Britain, is now working on a debut in the United States. It aims to increase the supply of affordable parking by making use of private spots, in driveways or in parking decks, that are available. The concept is similar to the online lodging service Airbnb, except you're renting parking spaces instead of a room.
Anthony Eskinazi, ParkatmyHouse's founder and chief executive, said in telephone interview that his company had been operating since 2006 in Britain, where it claims roughly 150,000 registered users and an inventory of some 40,000 parking spaces. Mr. Eskinazi describes the service a "matchmaker" between drivers and parking spaces.
Mr. Eskinazi is beginning to market the service's operations in the United States, with an initial focus on the New York/New Jersey/Connecticut area, as well as in Boston and Washington. The domestic version of the site is just getting started. When I recently typed "parkatmyhouse" into Google, it showed a link to a Web site that lets you submit a request for an area in which you'd like to find parking. (It also provided a link that led to the British Web site, which could be helpful if, say, you are hunting for a spot near Heathrow Airport.)
Mr. Eskinazi said he was working on lining up owners to list their parking spots on the United States Web site and that visitors would soon be connected automatically to a live search site. (To get an idea of how it will work, he said, you can check out a smattering of live rentals available in the Boston area. But he warns that the site isn't "Americanized," so there may, for instance, be some confusing British lingo.)
Mr. Eskinazi said he thought the idea would catch on quickly, as people became more familiar with the so-called "sharing economy. "The U.S. market is huge," he said, noting that people can spend years on waiting lists for available monthly commuter parking in parts of Connecticut. The company has backing from BMW i Ventures, a venture capital outfit based in New York City.
Here's how the site works in Britain, and, if Mr. Eskinazi's efforts pan out, here as well. If you want find a spot to rent, whether for a day, a week or on a regular basis, you type in the relevant Zip code to find available spots, along with information about the rates and other attributes (that is, outdoors, in a garage, lighting and security features, etc). You can rent short-term or long-term, depending on your needs and what's available. You must register on the site and can ask for more details about the property from the owner before committing. The site provides a contract for you to download.
Renters can pay for their space using a credit or debit card or PayPal, Mr. Eskinazi said. ParkatmyHouse makes a 15 percent commission on each transaction. (The frequently asked questions on the British site mention a cash payment option, but Mr. Eskinazi said that option would be removed "shortly.")
In Britain, he said, one renter is a mother who used a parking space for 15 minutes each weekday morning so she can park and walk her child into school. Another is a homeowner who rents her driveway during soccer matches at a nearby stadium.
If you own a spot you want to rent, you can list it -- along with its availability and rate -- free on the site. Homeowners with just one spot in their driveway can list it, as can businesses with a larger lot that's vacant on weekends, or churches that have empty spots during the week, he said. "Honestly, it's whatever you want. We're completely flexible."
There are some requirements. You must own the parking space you list or have the legal right to rent it. If your space comes along with an apartment you rent, for instance, you probably need your landlord's permission to rent out the space. In Britain, at least, landlords are often agreeable if they are given a cut of the parking income, Mr. Eskinazi said.
As a security precaution, the Web site does not list the specific address of the parking space in question. That's provided later in the transaction. The service also makes other safety suggestions, like asking the renter to provide a description of the vehicle and information about who will be driving it when it shows up.
What do you think of this concept? Would you rent from a private homeowner? Or list your own parking space for rent to strangers?

HEADLINE: Are Inequality and Immobility Inseparable?

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Liberals think so. They may be wrong. 

 BODY:
I've written a number of posts and pieces pushing the idea that American conservatives need what I've called an opportunity agenda - one that focuses more on the problems of upward mobility and stagnating wages than does the current standard Republican line, but doesn't share contemporary liberalism's tendency to blame the struggles of downscale Americans almost entirely on the richest 1 percent. I thought I'd use this post to respond to the most plausible left-wing critique of this idea. (I'll tackle the most plausible right-wing critique in a later post.) First, here's Matt Yglesias, pivoting off an excellent piece by my colleague Jason DeParle to question the idea that there's any real distinction between fighting inequality and fighting immobility:
My suspicion, living and working in mostly progressive circles, is that most of the people upset about "inequality" are actually bothered by what they see as There's a lot of ideological diversity on the left, and perhaps some people are in fact saying that it would be a good tradeoff to make America more equal even if that meant lower absolute incomes for middle class and poor families. But I don't think that's really something most of the people who say they're bothered by inequality are bothered by.
The people who care about inequality, in other words, care about it they care about social mobility. And are they right to do so? Well, here's Alan Krueger, the Chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, trying to provide a statistical basis for the idea that the two issues can't be separated:
Recent work by Miles Corak finds an intriguing link between [intergenerational mobility] and income inequality at a point in time. Countries that have a high degree of inequality also tend to have less economic mobility across generations. We have extended this work using OECD data on after-tax income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient. This next figure shows a scatter diagram of the relationship between income mobility across generations ... and inequality in the mid-1980s ... I call this the "Great Gatsby Curve." The points cluster around an upward sloping line, indicating that countries that had more inequality across households also had more persistence in income from one generation to the next.
So there you have it. (You can see the Gatsby curve reproduced on my colleague Paul Krugman's blog here.) Inequality and immobility increase in tandem, to care about one is to care about the other, and conservative attempts to disentangle the two are just a clever way of evading the need to take on the East Eggers of our own era and make them pay their fare share.
Except that perhaps it isn't quite this open and shut. Here's Brookings' Scott Winship, who's written perceptively about social mobility for National Review, critiquing Krueger's methodology:
Each of the points in the Great Gatsby chart represents an immobility estimate taken from independent earlier studies. It is very difficult to get comparable estimates of immobility for different countries. One needs measures of income defined in a common way across countries. Ideally, one would have multiple years of income data for each generation, and the analyses would use real data, as opposed to model-based estimates, on adults and on their parents when they were children. This last requirement is perhaps the hardest to meet. Many governments do not conduct studies tracking children's income as they grow older (or have only started to recently), so researchers must estimate childhood income using an algorithm obtained from a separate data set and compare the result against actual adult-child income.
Because of these technical difficulties, for some countries-particularly the United Kingdom-researchers estimating immobility come up with widely varying estimates. Building a Great Gatsby chart then requires choosing an immobility estimate to represent the country. Different scholars choose different estimates, with the result that their best-fitting lines differ. In the version I trust the most, there is a relationship between inequality and immobility, but it is entirely driven by three countries-the United States, Italy, and France. In particular, the estimates of immobility for the United Kingdom range widely across different versions of these charts.
Do read the whole thing. Winship acknowledges that the data suggests relation between inequality and immobility - and, indeed, it would be surprising if none existed. But the connection isn't nearly as direct and clear-cut as Krueger suggests. (For one thing, as Winship notes, the Gatsby chart compares immobility data for people who were in their 30s during the 1990s - early Generation Xers, that is - to inequality data from the 1980s. But if we're interested in the future of mobility, and how "inequality experienced in childhood affects mobility between childhood and adulthood," then the proper comparison should match immobility data from the '90s with inequality data from the more-equal 1960s and 1970s - which would presumably yield different results.) And this implies, in turn, that policymakers shouldn't just assume that measures that reduce inequality will necessarily improve upward mobility. They should look at specific policies, rather than a general trend, and assess their likely impact on both phenomena.
And this is where I think the American left fall short. I agree with Yglesias that most liberals who care about inequality care about immobility as well. But it makes a difference where you start, and where you put your energy - and because the left-wing focus on the sins of the top 1 percent is so strong, and the left-wing identification with existing government programs so intense, there's an awful lot of Democratic political energy behind the proposition that the very best policy course for 21st century America consists primarily of "higher taxes on the rich to fund generous pay for public sector workers while avoiding any cuts to Social Security and Medicare (or any other existing program, for that matter)."
This is a policy mix that would clearly lead to at least some reductions in post-tax inequality between the top 1 percent and everyone else. It's much less clear whether it's a policy mix that would do much for middle-class wages overall or enhance upward mobility for the working poor. If you look at the comparison of mobility in Denmark to mobility in the United States that accompanied DeParle's article, it's clear that our mobility problem is concentrated in the poorest quintile of the population. If you look at data on middle-class wage stagnation, meanwhile, it's clear that a big part of the problem is the growth of health care costs, which claim an ever larger - and very soon, impossibly large - chunk of take-home pay. Taken together, then, there's a good case to be made that the quest for broadly shared prosperity requires thinking through and addressing issues like family breakdown and mass incarceration at the bottom of the ladder (as well as the impact of low-skilled immigration, as David Frum notes), health care cost inflation in the middle rungs, and the weaknesses of our education sector across the board. Some of these are issues where the left is arguably ahead of the right (prison reform, in particular); some are issues where there's potential common ground (education reform); some are issues where ideological differences inevitably lead to very different prescriptions (health care reform, and the cost issue in particular). But none of them are issues where raising taxes today in order to postpone public sector reforms till tomorrow seems likely to bear much fruit for future generations - especially since that postponement will lead, inexorably, to tax increases that hit a much larger population than just the richest 1 percent.
In this sense, the focus on inequality inequality has made liberalism's job too easy. It's encouraged liberals to rally around modest changes to the tax code that would reduce incomes at the top, instead of forcing them to reckon with the deeper, more challenging problems inherent in institutions that they themselves helped build.
Update: If you're interested in venturing even deeper into the weeds, here's Winship's reply to Miles Corak's critique of Winship's critique of Krueger's invocation of Corak's data.

HIGHLIGHT: What if the Democrats took a more philosophical approach to their opposition to Republican positions? 

 BODY:
As a philosophy professor, I spend much of my time thinking about the arguments put forward by professional philosophers. As a citizen (and an occasional columnist for The Stone), I also spend lots of time thinking about the arguments put forward by Democrats and Republicans on currently disputed political issues. Of course, there are differences in logical sophistication and complexity between the philosophical and the political arguments. But, allowing that popular political arguments require shortcuts from full academic rigor, there is not, I think, that much difference between the logical acumen of politicians and philosophers. 
But there is one respect in which philosophers' arguments are far superior to those of politicians. To be taken seriously, a philosophical argument has to begin from a thorough understanding of an opponent's' position and formulate the position so that it is as plausible and attractive as possible. Politicians, by contrast, typically load the dice by attacking the weakest versions of their opponents' views they can find. 
We could greatly improve the quality of our political debates if we simply held to the philosophers' rule of understanding and charitably formulating our opponents' views. To illustrate my point, consider how Democrats might approach the core conservative position that almost all the current Republican presidential candidates endorse. (Ron Paul's libertarianism separates him from the core on some key points.) The candidates' disagreements are typically not about whether the conservative position is correct but about which of them most sincerely and consistently holds it. 
This core conservative position consists of a set of canonical views on government, economics and religion/ethics. On government, the candidates think there should be much less of it, particularly less regulation of business, less support for social welfare programs and less control of ordinary citizens' lives. Economically, their goal is to balance the budget, pay off public debt, lower taxes and support the efforts of businesses to increase their profits and thereby generate new jobs. They also see it as crucial to support traditional Christianity and to endorse its ethical views, particularly on matters of sexuality, especially opposition to abortion and to same-sex marriage.
Why might a sensible person be sympathetic to these sorts of views? It helps to see them as based on a general picture of the strengths of our nation and the dangers to its flourishing. The strengths are our free enterprise system and our religious/ethical heritage of hard work, individual responsibility and adherence to traditional moral standards. The working of the free enterprise system generates sufficient wealth to allow almost everyone to have at least an adequate standard of living and also produces innovations that continually improve that standard. Of course, there will be people who, because of bad luck or their own moral failings, wind up deprived of basic human goods. The primary remedy for this should be the charitable instincts of fellow-citizens living a life of Christian faith, which is also the source of human fulfillment, beyond mere material prosperity
On this Republican view, there are two great internal dangers to our way of life. First, there are forces such as secularism and relativism that threaten our basic ethical values. Second, there is the perhaps well-intentioned but deeply wrong belief that governmental planning and regulation can significantly improve on our free enterprise system as a way of providing for our material needs. On the contrary, major interventions almost always make things much worse. Maintaining the integrity of our ethical values and of our free enterprise system are the keys to solving almost all of our problems. 
Given this sort of sympathetic formulation of the conservative position, critics can still find ample grounds for disagreement. The formulation identifies several key assumptions that opponents may well question: that, left to itself, the free market will not cause unacceptable hardship for large numbers of people; that substantial government intervention almost always leads to bad results; that Christian ethics-especially with the conservative emphasis on sexuality-is the best code of moral behavior. But our sympathetic formulation allows an even more effective way of criticizing the conservative position: not by arguing against its key assumptions but by arguing that those very assumptions lead to contradictions.
In particular, there is a basic tension between the two main elements of the conservative view: Christian ethical values and the free enterprise system. Christian morality is a matter of love for others and self-sacrifice on their behalf. A market economy assumes that all agents (employers, workers, buyers, sellers) act in their own selfish interests. The problem is evident in the New Testament's unease with the wealthy and sympathy for the poor; see, for example, Matthew 13: 22, Mark 10: 23-25 and James 5: 1-3. 
The standard response to this sort of moral objection is that the "invisible hand" of the market produces public goods out of private selfishness. If we all act for our own selfish ends, there will be far more material goods for us to share than there would be otherwise. But this is a utilitarian argument; that is, one that judges actions as moral because they increase our material happiness. Christian morality, however, denies that moral good and evil depend on what maximizes such happiness. Christian love and self-sacrifice, in particular, are moral goods in their own right, regardless of their consequences. Conversely, conservative Christian morality would not allow homosexuality or same-sex marriage, even if it turned out that doing so would increase material happiness.
I am not proposing this line of argument as a decisive refutation of the views held by the current Republican presidential candidates. But it is, I maintain, an argument based on a sympathetic analysis of those views and requires a serious response from people who hold them. It is not the end of a fruitful discussion of our political differences, but it could be the beginning.

HEADLINE: Testing for Need

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Easier eligibility for some government programs for the needy has contributed to the rise in government spending, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
One myth about the surge in federal government spending over the last four years is that it was an automaticresponse to the recession. But the "tests" that beneficiaries of various government safety-net programs are required to pass before they can participate have gotten easier since 2007.
The government safety net is intended to help people in need. Because a lot of people don't need the government's help, a variety of tests have been designed to distinguish the needy from everybody else. These include employment tests, asset tests, income tests, earnings tests, retirement tests and age tests.
Two of the largest government programs are Social Security and Medicare. They administer essentially one test, for age. Once a person reaches age 65 (sometimes earlier), he or she can receive benefits from these programs regardless of income, assets or employment status.
In the past, and still today in most of Europe, Social Security required beneficiaries not only to be elderly but to be retired - the retirement test.
These days unemployment insurance is another major government expenditure, and its beneficiaries have to pass an employment test. That is, they have to be without a job and actively looking for one in order to receive benefits (a few states have small programs for employed but underemployed workers). Once a person passes the employment test, his or her assets or financial income are irrelevant for determining eligibility or benefits.

Beginning in the 1990s, cash family assistance or "welfare" programs began to have their own employment tests, but with the opposite determination: employment was required for participation. The 2009 American Reinvestment and Recovery Act permitted states to relax some of these requirements.
Family assistance programs traditionally had asset and income tests: a family could qualify only if both its income and assets were low enough. Medicaid - a government-financed health-insurance program for the poor - also has asset and income tests. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 relaxed some income tests effective 2014, although even then a family with too much income will not qualify for Medicaid.
Traditionally the food stamp program (now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and participants now receive debit cards from the Department of Agriculture, rather than "stamps") overlapped closely with family assistance programs, with some of the same asset and income tests. The 2002 farm bill provided an opportunity to avoid some of the SNAP tests, and states have recently taken that opportunity.
The bill allowed states to confer automatic SNAP eligibility on all households receiving a specified social service informational brochure, hard as that may be to believe. Households that participate in SNAP under this "broad-based categorical eligibility" rule still have benefits determined by the same formula (of household size and net income) as the other SNAP beneficiaries.
A practical result of broad-based categorical eligibility is that households can receive benefits based solely on their net income - it typically must be less than 130 percent of federal poverty guidelines (about $20,000 a year for a family of four) - and not based on the value of their assets or their employment status.
Even SNAP households not taking part through broad-based categorical eligibility saw the asset test relaxed by the 2008 farm bill, as the values of vehicles, retirement accounts and education savings accounts began to be excluded from the test.
So, simply put, in most states having assets is no longer a barrier to receiving food stamps. That's the main reason that participation in the program increased 37 percent more than the number of families with income near or below the poverty line.
I agree that safety net programs would have grown from the recession alone, but, for better or for worse, they have grown many times beyond that thanks to numerous changes in program rules.

HEADLINE: What the Top 1% of Earners Majored In

BYLINE: ROBERT GEBELOFF and SHAILA DEWAN


HIGHLIGHT: The majors providing the best entree into the top income rank are pre-med, economics, biochemistry, zoology and biology. 

 BODY:
12:21 p.m. | Updated Added a fuller list of majors at the bottom of the post.
 We got an interesting question from an academic adviser at a Texas university: could we tell what the top 1 percent of earners majored in? 
 The writer, sly dog, was probably trying to make a point, because he wrote from a biology department, and it turns out that biology majors make up nearly 7 percent of college graduates who live in households in the top 1 percent.
 According to the Census Bureau's 2010 American Community Survey, the majors that give you the best chance of reaching the 1 percent are pre-med, economics, biochemistry, zoology and, yes, biology, in that order.
 Below is a chart showing the majors most likely to get into the 1 percent (excluding majors held by fewer than 50,000 people in 2010 census data). The third column shows the percentage of degree holders with that major who make it into the 1 percent. The fourth column shows the percent of the 1 percent (among college grads) that hold that major. In other words, more than one in 10 people with a pre-med degree make it into the 1 percent, and about 1 in 100 of the 1 percenters with degrees majored in pre-med.
 Of course, choice of major is not the only way to increase your chances of reaching the 1 percent, if that is your goal. There is also the sector you choose.

A separate analysis of census data on occupations showed that one in eight lawyers, for example, are in the 1 percent -- unless they work for a Wall Street firm, when their chances increase to one in three. Among chief executives, fewer than one in five rank among the 1 percent, but their chances increase if the company produces medical supplies (one in four) or drugs (two in five). Hollywood writers? One in nine are 1 percenters. Television or radio writers? One in 14. Newspaper writers and editors? One in 62.

HEADLINE: Homai Vyarawalla, 'First Lady of the Lens'

BYLINE: HEATHER TIMMONS


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the work of India's first female photojournalist. 

 BODY:
Homai Vyarawalla, India's first female photojournalist, who died on Sunday, chronicled India's independence with a spirit that was unmatched by the following generations, in part because of changes in India itself.
"Her images of Jawaharlal Nehru addressing a jubilant crowd in Delhi, and of the body of Mohandas K. Gandhi being prepared for cremation, give a vivid sense of the mood of a nation whose self-image was cast in a romantic epic mold," Holland Cotter wrote in The New York Times in a 1997 review of a show in Queens, New York, that featured Ms. Vyarawalla's work.
"Much has happened since -- sectarian violence, economic upheaval, the extended medical emergency of AIDS -- to eat away at that initial tragedy-shadowed optimism," Mr. Cotter wrote. "And the heightened, even exultant mood that runs through Ms. Vyarawalla's pictures is nowhere to be found in the work of her younger colleagues."
Ms. Vyarawalla died on Sunday at age 98 in Vadodara. Her passing, and her iconoclastic life, were chronicled by news outlets in India during the past two days, but there are few examples of her photographs on the Internet. Later in life, Ms. Vyarawalla gave her collection of photographs to the New Delhi-based Alkazi Foundation for the Arts ("like a true Gandian," the Hindustan Times observed).
An Alkazi Foundation spokeswoman shared these images with India Ink.
The daughter of traveling theatre professionals, Ms. Vyarawalla married at a young age to a Times of India photographer and accountant, said India Today, in a story that dubbed her the "First Lady of the Lens."
"The Vyarawallas got their big break when World War II came to Asia. With Singapore being overrun by the Japanese, the British shifted their Information Office to New Delhi. The office was looking for photographers and Stanley Jepson at the Weekly recommended the Vyarawallas, who shifted to New Delhi in 1942.
[Husband] Manekshaw was "lent" to the British Information Services (BIS) for one year by The Times of India, but Homai became a full-time employee at BIS and was allowed to accept freelance assignments also."
Ms. Vyarawalla traveled around Delhi by bicycle, wearing a sari and lugging her heavy equipment herself.
In 1970, she abruptly packed up her cameras, disgusted by her peers in photojournalism. "My colleagues had all been gentlemen but the new crop did not know how to behave in high society," Ms. Vyarawalla told India Today. "I did not want to be associated with such riffraff."

HEADLINE: Group Sues Over Denial of Permit to Protest at Courthouse

BYLINE: COLIN MOYNIHAN


HIGHLIGHT: A group that planned to protest at a Manhattan courthouse around the second anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision in the Citizens United case, which eliminated barriers to corporations' political speech and spending, sued a federal agency after its permit was denied. 

 BODY:
A group that is planning to protest at a Manhattan courthouse around the second anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision in the Citizens United case, which eliminated barriers to corporations' political speech and spending, sued federal officials on Wednesday after its request for a permit to gather was denied.
Lawyers for protesters who had applied for the permit, as part of a campaign organized by a group called Move to Amend, which seeks to reverse the Citizens United decision, filed the suit, saying the denial of permission to hold a rally on Friday outside the federal courthouse at 500 Pearl Street, in Lower Manhattan, was unconstitutional. In the suit, the lawyers ask a judge to grant an injunction requiring the agency to issue a permit. 
Organizers with Move to Amend, which seeks to amend the Constitution to "firmly establish that money is not speech," plan demonstrations outside more than 100 federal courthouses in 46 states on Friday, in cities like Baltimore, Seattle and St. Louis. And a gathering is planned outside the Supreme Court building in Washington. 
The group's Web site describes the day as a "nationwide protest against corporate personhood" called "Occupy the Courts." In many cities, people associated with encampments inspired by Occupy Wall Street helped organize the rallies.
Arrangements had been worked out with officials in 118 cities, organizers said, all where protests were planned except Bryson City, N.C., and New York.
In New York, the permit application, requesting permission for 200 demonstrators to assemble outside the courthouse's Pearl Street entrance, was submitted on Dec. 29 to the federal agency, the Government Services Administration. The man who sent the application, Jarret Wolfman, said that an official there, Wesley C. French, told him that that new citizens would be sworn in at the courthouse that morning and that a judge would be installed during an afternoon ceremony.
Mr. French denied the application on Friday with a letter citing events planned at the courthouse that day. "The activity proposed in your application will interfere with these events," he wrote. "Consequently we are denying your application."
A lawyer for the protesters, Gideon O. Oliver, filed an appeal on Monday with the agency, writing that the denial was unreasonable and exceeded the government's authority to regulate speech. He said the agency did not respond.
Officials at the Government Services Administration could not immediately be reached for comment. 
In the lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Mr. Oliver and other lawyers wrote that the agency "had provided no information about the ways in which Occupy the Courts might relate to or potentially interfere with" other events taking place inside the courthouse.
David Cobb, a spokesman for Move to Amend, said that it was important for people to be able to air their views on the Citizens United decision, made in January 2010, outside federal courthouses and added that officials in New York had "forced an unnecessary confrontation over the people's right to assemble."

HEADLINE: Down on the Farm, a Sculpture Finds a Second Life

BYLINE: RACHEL NUWER


HIGHLIGHT: The Pennsylvania Farm Show's famed butter sculpture finds a new use this year, returning to a dairy farm to be processed into biogas. 

 BODY:
At Pennsylvania's Farm Show, a boy of around 10 proudly presents his prize dairy calf to onlookers. Chin held high, he accepts the golden ribbon for best of show. Today, he's the talk of the town, but tomorrow he'll be converted into a pile of melted grease to be mixed in with liquid manure. He's part of the show's famous 1,000-pound butter sculpture, and he's going to be recycled.
"Just about everyone who comes to the farm show sees the butter sculpture. It's kind of one of those must-see things," Nicole Bucher, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Agriculture Department, said of the oleaginous artwork, a 20-year tradition and a popular meeting point for many of the show's 400,000 visitors.
Each year the show's organizers ponder a familiar question: what to do with all that butter after the festivities end? Sanitation protocols prevent it from being sold for consumption. In recent years it has been converted to biodiesel, and one time it was donated to schools for use in science projects.
This year, however, the sculpture will travel full circle, returning to a dairy farm before it is converted into biofuel. "This is the first time in my memory that it's gone back to the farmers directly," Ms. Bucher said.

The lucky recipient is Steve Reinford of Reinford Dairy Farms in Mifflintown. "Someone piped up my name, and I received a call from the U.S.D.A. wondering if I could use the butter," he said in an interview. "I said, absolutely."
When Mr. Reinford's son returned from college several years ago, he told his father that their farm could benefit by harnessing renewable energy. His interest piqued, Mr. Reinford began looking into various options and eventually decided to install a mix digester that produces biofuel.
The digester churns out about 140 kilowatts of electricity per hour with manure from Mr. Reinford's 500-odd cows as well as food waste donated from local Walmarts. With the energy, he heats his home, powers his Chevy Volt, pasteurizes milk, dries corn and still has surplus energy to sell to Pennsylvania Power and Light. He uses the sterilized solid waste as bedding for the cows and sells the excess to neighboring farmers. It also reduces the odor of the manure, another bonus.
"With this technology, a whole new value is added to the dairy farm," he said. "It benefits the environment and the economy."
Mr. Reinford's is one of about two dozen Pennsylvania farms that have installed anaerobic digesters. "We're probably one of the leading states in farmers' adopting the practice," said Robert Graves, a professor of agricultural engineering at Penn State. "Most of our farmers are always willing to make a little more money."
Dr. Graves said that Vermont is probably the premier state for farm-derived biofuel, with that state's farmers struggling to produce enough electricity to meet the demand of consumers willing to pay a bit more for green electricity.
Biogas is derived from a natural biological process, the same one that cows use to break down food in their stomachs. In the absence of oxygen, micro-organisms feast on organic materials like manure or yard waste, excreting about 70 percent methane and 30 percent carbon dioxide, the components of biogas. This low-grade form of natural gas can be sent into an engine generator set to produce electricity and thermal energy.
"We put modern engineering around this process and capture biogas for renewable energy," said Paul Sellew, the chief executive of Harvest Power, a company based in Waltham, Mass., that develops technology to convert food scraps and organic debris into electricity.
Pennsylvania's 1,000-pound butter sculpture is just "a very tiny example" of the about 95 million tons of food and yard waste that Americans dispose of each year, Mr. Sellew said. Harvest's 11 facilities, located around urban centers, collect 1.3 million tons of such waste and convert it into energy, compost and fertilizer. "It's a very nice sustainable cycle," Mr. Sellew said.
He suggested that the United States could become the world's leader in biogas, overtaking Germany, which has perhaps the most advanced renewable energy system, including around 7,000 installations for converting organic waste into energy.
Dr. Graves, however, said it remained to be seen whether biogas will take off in the United States. Historically, interest in biogas is kindled when the price of energy goes up, he says, but people tend to get used to the higher cost later and return to their old ways.
In Pennsylvania, subsidies from the state and local governments helped many of the farms install the pricey digesters, although those funds have dried up. (The installations can range from hundreds of thousands of dollars to over $1 million.) "In addition to a large capital requirement, there's a managerial requirement," Dr. Graves said. For this reason, digesters are usually feasible only on large farms.
Back on the dairy farm, Mr. Reinford was preparing for the butter's arrival. "We'll probably use it over a period of about 20 to 30 days -- we can't feed it all in one shot," he said. The butter will heat his home for about three days.
For its part, the butter sculpture performs a broader service by bringing attention to renewable energy, Dr. Graves said. "It's a hackneyed win-win situation," he said.

HEADLINE: Christie Takes Mild Swipe at Cuomo on Tax Plan

BYLINE: KATE ZERNIKE


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Christie, seen as a potential candidate for president in 2016, and Mr. Cuomo, another potential candidate for president, offer differing views on what kind of taxes their constituents should pay. 

 BODY:
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey struck a remarkably friendly tone in his State of the State speech on Tuesday, but that didn't stop him from taking a swipe across the Hudson River at Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (though he did call him "my friend Andrew Cuomo").
Mr. Christie, a Republican who many see as a potential presidential contender, proposed a 10 percent cut in income taxesfor all New Jersey residents, which would be phased in over three years. He knows that the Democrats who control the State Legislature would prefer a so-called millionaires' tax, raising the marginal tax rate on the state's highest earners.
Their plan would look more like the one negotiated in New York last month by Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who many also see as a potential presidential contender, and a possible rival for Mr. Christie in 2016.
"Make no mistake; we are in a competition," Mr. Christie told the Legislature. But no, he didn't mean for the White House. "A competition for jobs," he said. "Among countries, yes, but also among states."
"Now, some will argue, 'Wait a minute, New York only raised taxes on the rich. Why not adopt Governor Cuomo's package for New Jersey?'" Mr. Christie said. But if New Jersey enacted the same rates as New York, he said, every person earning less than $100,000 would also get a tax increase, in some cases paying double what they do now.
"And by the way, those earning a million dollars would get a tax cut. Is that what we want?" he said. "Is that fairness? I don't think so."
That might be true if New York's income tax brackets were simply exported to New Jersey. But his remarks made it look as if Mr. Cuomo had agreed to raise taxes on the middle class. In fact, New York's plan lowered its tax rate on those earning less than $150,000 - even Republican leaders praised the plan for lowering personal income taxes to their lowest rate in 50 years.
And New York's highest earners will be taxed at a lower rate than they were last year because a tax surcharge that applied to them expired at the end of last year. But their new tax rate, at least through 2014, will still be higher than it would have been without any changes to the income tax brackets.
New York's new top tax bracket, 8.82 percent through 2014, ranks among the highest in the country. But it is still lower than New Jersey's current 8.97 percent, the nation's highest rate.

HEADLINE: The FOF Theory of the GOP Primary

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Don't blame the candidates. 

 BODY:
Steve Benen notes that by normal standards, Mitt Romney is a terrible candidate -- but just not as bad as his rivals. He adds,
I often wonder what the race for the Republican nomination would look like this year if Romney had just one credible opponent. 
But that wasn't going to happen! The weakness of the GOP field is not an accident.
I view the primary race through the lens of the FOF theory -- that's for "fools and frauds". It goes as follows: to be a good Republican right now, you have to affirm your belief in things that any halfway intelligent politician can see are plainly false. This leaves room for only two kinds of candidates: those who just aren't smart and/or rational enough to understand the problem, and those who are completely cynical, willing to say anything to get ahead.
What sort of things am I talking about? They range from the belief that Obama is a socialist who will destroy America with his dastardly Heritage Foundation devised health care plan, to the belief that unemployment is high because lazy people prefer their unemployment insurance checks. On budget matters, you have to claim to believe that we can cut taxes sharply, maintain high military spending, and eliminate the deficit -- all without upsetting those Republican-voting Medicare recipients.
Notice that in the end, when it came to budget claims, even the supposedly hard-headed types -- (cough) Paul Ryan (cough) -- ended up relying on gigantic magic asterisks.
So what you have are fairly dim types like Perry, on the one side, and the utterly cynical Romney, on the other. (Gingrich manages to be both a fool and a fraud). Maybe, just maybe, the GOP could have found someone able to achieve Romney-level cynicism while coming across as sincere; but political talent on that level is quite rare. I mean, the various non-crazy-non-Romneys who were supposed to have a shot all turned out to be duds, e.g. Pawlenty.
The weakness of the GOP field is, in short, structural. Without the still-terrible economy, they wouldn't have a chance.

HEADLINE: Obama's Pipeline Move: Something for Everyone

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama, as anticipated, kills an application for a controversial pipeline. 

 BODY:
There's been extensive coverage of President Obama's decision, forced by a Republican legislative maneuver, to reject the application for a much-debated pipeline project, known as Keystone XL, that would have carried a tarry oil precursor from Canadian oil sands to American refineries.
The bottom line is well summarized by John Broder and Dan Frosch in The Times:
While the president's action does not preclude later approval of the project, it sets up a baldly partisan fight over energy, jobs and regulation that will most likely persist through the November election.
Here's Obama's statement on the decision. Energetic rallying cries building on the decision came from people as varied as Bill McKibben at 350.org and right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh. (There's a long interesting look at McKibben's role in the pipeline fight in this Sunday's Boston Globe Magazine.)
I'm in North Carolina giving a blitz of talks in the Raleigh-Durham area on ways to use new communication tools to make the world a better place and have been unable to weigh in on the anticipated move. (My next stop is my first visit to the Science Online conference.)
I did post one thought on Twitter which I think encapsulates some important elements of what happened:
Reports on crude oil markets noted small fluctuations in crude prices today, mostly related to economic activity on the demand side of the oil business. 
To step back for a broader perspective on this source of oil, re-read Michael Levi and Vaclav Smil. 
How would you summarize things, Twitter style, in 140 characters or less?

HEADLINE: The United States Economy Through a Private Equity Lens

BYLINE: JESSE EISINGER


HIGHLIGHT: As Mitt Romney defends his tenure at Bain Capital on the presidential campaign trail, some on Wall Street wonder how running a private equity firm compares to running the country. 

 BODY:
Imagine how Mitt Romney would campaign if he actually ran as a private equity executive, dangerous though that may be in this era of the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street.
Aggressively attacked by a super PAC supporting Newt Gingrich, Mr. Romney stands accused of being a rapacious capitalist intent on destroying jobs for personal gain. Mr. Romney has responded: Au contraire! He argues that his work at Bain Capital, one of the earliest and most successful private equity firms, created jobs by making companies more efficient and successful.
 Many people on Wall Street are befuddled. After all, a private equity firm creating jobs is like Adam Sandler winning an Academy Award - it would be nice if it happened, but it sure wasn't the goal.
The goal, of course, is high returns.
If Mr. Romney were really running as a private equity executive, how would he view what his campaign regards as one of the nation's most pressing issues, the national debt
Right at the top of his campaign's home page, Mr. Romney proclaims, "We have a moral responsibility not to spend more than we take in." The United States' debt is such a problem, it's like an addiction: "The first step toward recovery is admitting we have a problem and refusing to allow any more irresponsible borrowing," his site says.
It's almost as if Mr. Romney never worked in - what's that other phrase for private equity? - oh yes, a leveraged buyout firm. Leverage as in debt, debt and more debt. Debt amplifies the returns of L.B.O. firms. Indeed, they often saddle companies with extra debt precisely so that their investors can cash out faster, a technique Bain deployed under Mr. Romney's watch.
L.B.O. firms certainly never think of debt as immoral. When the borrowing is good, private equity is going to grab the money. When Mr. Romney rails against debt, he is running away from his entire career in business.
So what about the federal government? The 10-year Treasury bond rate is 1.87 percent. Since inflation is higher than that, real rates are actually below zero, meaning that a lender to the United States government will get back less money in 10 years than it started with.
That's right: When the government borrows, its lenders actually lose money. Yet foreigners and Americans, institutions and individuals alike are extraordinarily willing to shovel money at the United States government right now.
Are there private equity executives anywhere in the world who would counsel their companies not to borrow at such extremely low rates? I haven't had the privilege of meeting one. Their mantra is, borrow now, for tomorrow the Mayans might turn out to be right. Few indeed are the companies that could borrow that cheaply and not make some kind of return on essentially free money.
"If debt is available to you historically cheaply, it almost always makes sense to take it," said Shivan Govindan, a private equity executive for the Resource Financial Institutions Group. "Your capital strategy isn't something ideological. You are going to optimize it for the best mix."
So, by the logic of private equity, the United States government should borrow much more right now.
But what about the unsustainability of our debt? If a company has out-of-control costs and is spiraling toward default, it should not borrow more. True, but no company that is truly headed toward imminent default can borrow as cheaply as the American government.
If the United States government is headed toward bankruptcy, lenders are surely not acting that way. Maybe those people are making a good decision; maybe they are deluded. It doesn't matter to the borrower.
Of course, an issue for the United States, as for a company, is whether it could put the money to good use.
"Surely, government investments would have a real return in a 10-year period higher than zero, even with waste and corruption," said Paul L. Kasriel, an economist for Northern Trust. "This means that these investments will boost future real G.D.P. growth, which will boost future tax revenues to service the increased debt."
There will be bridges and roads that we must fix over the next decade. We could put more young people in college, improve elementary school education, train veterans so they can find good jobs or finance exploration of alternative fuels. People will quibble - or maybe, in our polarized culture, fight tooth and nail - over the choices, but most could think of something that would be a good investment.
On a deeper level, the debate over private equity raises questions about using the metaphor of America as a business. That kind of thinking can reduce society to the sum of its revenues and profits, ignoring that much of what we do to provide for the common defense and promote the general welfare cannot or should not be measured, especially in economic terms. We take care of our elderly because it is the right thing to do, not because we expect a return on investment. Shouldn't society promote and protect freedom and human rights? Even when there are times when doing so may be expensive or uneconomical?
There are moral issues that confront our country. Debt isn't one of them.

HEADLINE: Can I See Your Tax Return?

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Brooks and Collins wonder whether there is such a thing as too much sunshine. 

 BODY:
David Brooks: Gail, I'm sorry we missed each other in South Carolina, but I've moved on to the next primary state, Florida, in search of people who pay Mitt Romney's 15 percent tax rate. I'm in Palm Beach now. I think I've found them.
By the way, why do we make candidates release their tax forms? Has there ever been a case where a presidential decision has been influenced by some bit of information that might appear on a tax form? I doubt it. Has information on a tax form ever influenced anybody's vote? Never heard of such a case.
Gail Collins: You know I've never thought about that. Until Romney, I can't remember anybody whining about it.
David: The people calling for Romney to release his taxes say the public has a right to know where his money comes from. I'm not the closest student of the Constitution, but did I miss something? Which amendment is this right mentioned in? Perhaps it's a natural right. I don't think it's in the Old Testament. The Book of Mormon, maybe?
Gail: Not a sacred rule, perhaps. But I think it makes sense. We're talking about the presidency here. We're giving him/her the power to wage war, blow up the planet, ruin the economy. I think we kind of have the right to pry.
Or, in the immortal words of Rick Perry to the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce: "Everybody who wants to be president of the United States - you'd better be ready for your sheets to be lifted up." I'm sure he meant sheets of paper. In the tax accounts.
David: Can you think of a case when we have learned something from a disclosed tax return that was in any way useful? From Romney we'll probably learn that he's rich. We knew that. We'll probably learn that he pays a 15 percent capital gains rate. This has been one of the most well-documented aspects of the private equity business. We'll probably learn that he gives away a lot in charity. He's conservative. Conservatives generally give much more to charity than liberals, even excluding church donations. There's no surprise there.
Gail: No fair diverting the discussion with that charity thing. I don't think Mitt would have brought up the 15 percent figure at all if he didn't think he was in a corner. And while I don't know if it'll affect the election, it seems like an excellent education for the American public in how the tax system works to the advantage of certain citizens.
David: My own view is that the desire for full disclosure stems from a few things. First, pure prurience. Second, members of what used to be called the New Class perpetually labor under the delusion that other people dislike the rich as much as they do and if they can only disclose that someone is rich that will end their political chances. Third, there is a misbegotten ideology haunting the land, the ideology of sunshinism. This is the belief that everything should be made public.
Gail: I can't believe you're against sunshinism. We're in the shining-of-sun-into-dark-corners business. And we're only asking the man who wants to determine the future of our tax code how he made the current one work for himself.
David: Sunshinism is a destructive ideology. Forcing people to financially undress in public is just one of those incursions that repels decent people from running for office.
Gail: I repeat that we're not talking about a guy running for the Planning and Zoning commission here. It's not irrational for us to know what particular tax breaks a major presidential candidate has held near and dear in his own personal wealth-building life.
David: It also destroys people's faith in government. Have you noticed that as democracy has become more open, cynicism has skyrocketed and the effectiveness of government has gone down the toilet? Bill Galston of the Brookings Institution has the best observation on this - that parts of government should be hidden for the same reason middle-aged people should wear clothes.
Gail: Let me stress, we are not asking anybody to take off their clothes. But I am not going to get behind the idea that it's better for people to know less about their government. I don't like the idea of disillusioning the public, but that horse is pretty much out of the barn.
Did you know that the highest voter turnout in any presidential election was for William Henry Harrison v. Martin Van Buren? It was the worst campaign ever! Harrison's entire political identity was a total myth. He was marketed as a poor and humble soldier when in fact he was the product of Mitt-level wealth and breeding. But people were very enthusiastic and not cynical at all. What did they get out of it? William Henry Harrison.
David: If we're going to release tax returns, I think we should also release college transcripts. I'd actually be curious to see who got better grades at Harvard, Romney or Obama. Not that I have any right to know.
Gail: You know, I have always had a suspicion that the reason John Kerry was so reluctant to release his own estimable war records in response to the Swift -boating was because he was afraid his Yale grades would get out in the same package.
David: Now I could see making people release their tax forms if we imposed an income test on presidencies. To qualify to be president you'd have to be worth, say, $20 million.
This would be entirely sensible if we judged presidents the way universities judge incoming students. If you do it strictly as a matter of correlation, it's at least modestly true that rich people make better presidents: Washington, Jefferson (who was land rich), the Roosevelts, Kennedy, Reagan. I know Lincoln wasn't rich, but at least he worked as a corporate lawyer for many years.
Gail: Yipes! Washington - married a rich widow. Jefferson - inherited and blew all the money. Roosevelts - inherited. Kennedy - inherited. I give it to Reagan that he made his money selling Borax on "Death Valley Days" entirely on his own.
David: Sorry to go off on such a series of rants. To be honest, my brain has hurt ever since Ron Paul made that distinction between military spending and defense spending in the debate the other night. Was the invasion of Normandy military spending or defense spending? What about the Battle of the Bulge? I'm totally confused.
Gail: Try this. If you don't like it, it's military spending. If you like it, it's for defense. If you really want to know something secret, it's transparency. If you don't, it's prying.

HEADLINE: Good Decision on Keystone XL

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama was smart to reject the pipeline proposal. 

 BODY:
President Obama has at times failed to stand up for his principles (or at least what I thought were his principles) under the relentless Republican campaign to deny him anything he wants, even if the nation badly needs it.
Today, however, Mr. Obama didn't play to type. He formally rejected a proposal by the Canadian company TransCanada to build a pipeline that would carry heavy crude oil 1,700 miles across the United States - posing environmental and health hazards along the way and doing basically nothing to create long-term jobs or reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
Congressional Republicans had tried to coerce Mr. Obama into approving the pipeline, which the deep-pocketed oil industry loves, by inserting a 60-day deadline for a decision into a must-pass bill extending the payroll tax cut. That was not enough time to finish studying the potential environmental impact of the pipeline. The scam did not work.
In adopting the State Department's recommendation to reject the proposal, Mr. Obama said: "This announcement is not a judgment on the merits of the pipeline, but the arbitrary nature of a deadline that prevented the State Department from gathering the information necessary to approve the project and protect the American people." It would have been nice if he had also passed judgment on the project itself, but still it was a good move.
The reaction from pipeline supporters was tediously predictable. "President Obama is about to destroy tens of thousands of American jobs and sell energy security to the Chinese," said Brendan Buck, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner.
Tens of thousands of jobs destroyed? That would be just horrible. Except it's not true. The federal government has estimated (and TransCanada concurs) that the project would create 6,000 to 6,500 temporary construction jobs at best, for two years.
As for selling our energy security to the Chinese, it's hard to know what Mr. Buck was talking about. The pipeline would provide crude oil for refineries on the Gulf Coast, but most of their output is destined for export, anyway.
We're certain to hear a lot more about this in coming months as the 2012 campaign gets under way. I can only hope that voters will take a minute to look at the facts and not fall for the lie that Keystone could have truly helped-let alone saved-the American economy.

HEADLINE: As Romney Talks of Taxes, Bloomberg Says He Pays Highest Rate

BYLINE: MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire who is usually reticent to discuss his finances, said the bulk of his earnings stems from holdings in his eponymous media company, which he said is taxed as ordinary income at the highest city, state, and federal rates. 

 BODY:
A day after Mitt Romney conceded that he paid a lower tax rate than many Americans, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg - another politician who made his fortune in the financial industry - said on Wednesday that he personally paid "the highest personal income tax rate."
Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire who is usually reluctant to discuss his finances, said the bulk of his earnings stemmed from holdings in his media company, which he said was taxed as ordinary income at the highest city, state and federal rates, before he took deductions for charitable giving.
The highest federal income tax rate is 35 percent, far higher than the 15 percent effective tax rate that Mr. Romney said he pays. 
And in a remark sure to bother some of the mayor's high-flying friends, Mr. Bloomberg said he opposed the controversial tax provision that has allowed Mr. Romney, as well as other wealthy financiers, to pay a lower rate than many Americans on his income.
Mr. Romney currently receives a significant chunk of his income in the form of "carried interest," a once-obscure term that refers to a portion of the profits he receives from past investments in his former firm, Bain Capital. Federal legislation allows many hedge fund and private equity executives essentially to declare this income as a capital gain, allowing for a lower tax rate.
But Mr. Bloomberg stopped short of criticizing Mr. Romney, who has been attacked by his Republican rivals for admitting that he pays only about 15 percent of his annual income in taxes despite earning millions of dollars a year.
"Romney paid his taxes, I assume," the mayor said Wednesday at a news conference in the Bronx. "He didn't write the tax law. This is ridiculous. There's got to be other things to ask candidates who want to be president about what they would do."
Mr. Bloomberg, who accepts only a $1 salary from the city, said that "virtually none" of his own income was in the form of carried interest. 
"When you take out the money I give to charity, then I pay the highest personal income tax rate,'' he said. "I don't even have carried interest or any of those things. I don't even have a lot of capital gains. It's virtually none. It is all the income from the company and it's taxable as ordinary income, and I pay the highest rate, state, city and federal."
Mr. Bloomberg said that the elimination of the carried interest provision would be a painful but necessary step toward balancing the federal budget.
"If it were up to me, I would end the concept of carried interest," he said. "In every industry there are things that were put there perhaps to encourage or discourage certain kinds of economic activity, but that may not be appropriate today."
The mayor's statements echo the remarks of another billionaire, Warren E. Buffett, who is also an opponent of the carried interest exception. But they also pit Mr. Bloomberg against many Wall Street financiers who have fought to retain the lower tax rate.
Mr. Bloomberg, whose net worth is estimated at $19.5 billion by Forbes magazine, is relatively secretive about his own finances. Each year, he allows reporters to inspect a heavily redacted version of his tax forms for a few hours, and photocopies are not allowed. In the redacted forms, the mayor's earnings and losses are represented by a letter-based system of dollar ranges, rather than exact amounts.

HEADLINE: A Case of Good Timing, Perhaps, in Romney's Tax Disclosure

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: If Mitt Romney is the Republican presidential nominee, by the general election, his taxes might seem like old news. 

 BODY:
The pile-on began just moments after Mitt Romney - a man easily worth more than $200 million - admitted Tuesday morning that he pays federal taxes at a rate of about 15 percent, far less than most middle-income families.
But could the timing actually be good for Mr. Romney? 
Democrats pounced, gleeful at the prospect of portraying the leading Republican candidate as a direct beneficiary of tax policies that favor the wealthy over the middle class. They started a Twitter campaign to mock his reluctance to release his federal income tax returns. And they sent out more than a dozen e-mails citing his taxes.
"His tax plan would increase benefits for millionaires and billionaires," said Eric Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, on a conference call quickly organized by the Democratic National Committee. "I think it's very important to understand his refusal to disclose the loopholes he's using and the tax strategy he's employed."
And in case that was not enough, Mr. Romney offered some icing on the cake: an offhand remark that his income from paid speeches amounted to "not very much" money. The problem? In one recent year, he made $374,327.62 giving speeches - an amount vastly higher than the income of a typical family.
It was as if Mr. Romney was once again playing into the hands of President Obama's political advisers, who believe that voters will not elect a wealthy, Wall Street Republican during a time of economic uncertainty.
Tuesday's comments came on the heels of more than two weeks of attention - driven largely by Mr. Romney's Republican rivals - focused on his role as a venture capitalist who bought and sold businesses, with sometimes dire consequences for workers.
And that followed Mr. Romney's statement that he knows what it's like to worry about getting a pink slip, and a comment, taken out of context by his critics, that he "likes to fire people."
Taken together, the string of moments provided Democrats an opportunity to define Mr. Romney as out of touch with regular people, a creature of special interests and the embodiment of Mr. Obama's argument that the wealthy need to do more to help the nation get out of its fiscal hole.
"We won't be waiting until he reveals his returns in April to remind voters that Romney's tax policy would keep taxes low for millionaires like himself, putting a burden on the middle class," promised Bill Burton, the head of a "super PAC" backing Mr. Obama.
Mr. Burton predicted that concerns about Mr. Romney's wealth "will only grow as he is introduced to a general electorate that rightly has deep concerns about the Wall Street deals that benefited executives like Mitt Romney, but left middle class families devastated."
But it is not entirely clear that the sustained focus on Mr. Romney's wealth at this particular moment is a good thing for Mr. Obama's re-election hopes.
Aides to Mr. Romney have known for years that he would have to confront this issue. Having built his second presidential campaign primarily around his business experience, he was never going to be able to dismiss questions about his fortune and how he made it.
Having the subject of Mr. Romney's tax returns come up now, as he is battling for the Republican nomination, could make it seem like old news and no big deal if he becomes the nominee and Mr. Obama brings it up again this fall.
And if he wins the South Carolina primary on Saturday Mr. Romney can - and probably will - claim the victory as evidence that real voters were unmoved and unconcerned by his wealth and the flap over his taxes.
It may be dangerous, however, for Mr. Romney and his advisers to assume that they know how Democratic and independent voters will react to questions about his wealth. The media attention on Mr. Romney's work at Bain Capital, a private equity firm, and his taxes has played out this month against the backdrop of a Republican primary, with conservative voters paying the closest attention. That won't be the case in the fall if Mr. Romney is the Republican nominee, battling Mr. Obama for the independent voters in swing states.
The broader attacks on his wealth, and specifically his work at Bain Capital, have prompted conservative groups who have never been Mr. Romney's staunchest allies to rush to his aid. Those allies are now far more likely to come to his defense when the attacks are coming from Mr. Obama.
"Attacking Governor Romney for participating in free-market capitalism is just beyond the pale," said Chris Chocola, the president of Club for Growth, a group which by no means is a fan of Mr. Romney. (The group's recent white paper on Mr. Romney concluded that he "supports big government solutions to health care and opposes pro-growth tax code reform - positions that are simply opposite to those supported by true economic conservatives.")
Strategists for Mr. Obama are encouraged that they are already beginning to tell the story about Mr. Romney even before he has secured the nomination. But the danger for the Democratic team is that the story could seem old by the time it would have a real impact on the race between the two men.
And Mr. Romney and his allies are also using this opportunity as a dry run of sorts - testing which responses work and which do not. 
"It was sadly inevitable that the Obama campaign and the D.N.C. would demonize Governor Romney for succeeding in the private sector, abiding by the law, and seeking to keep taxes low for all Americans," wrote Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economic policy adviser for Senator John McCain in 2008, who is neutral this time. His article in National Review Online was titled: "It's the Silly (Tax Policy) Season."
Mr. Romney, too, will no doubt be better at answering these questions in nine months if he is the nominee.
If that is the case, he may look back on these past several weeks and remember them fondly as the time that he finally figured out how to confront the biggest attack on his economic credentials from President Obama.

HEADLINE: Inside Debate Prep at Fox News, a Discussion Over Race Question

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: Replacing the words "demeaning" and "racially charged" with insulting. 

 BODY:
MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. - The frosty exchange over race and social welfare between Juan Williams and Newt Gingrich during Monday night's Fox News debate has become a breakout moment of the South Carolina primary. For many conservatives, it demonstrates how liberals defend a broken entitlement system. And for many liberals, it shows how minorities are often unfairly caricatured as addicted to government aid.
As a team from Fox News prepared for this point in the debate, they knew they had a provocative issue on their hands. And they worked to massage Mr. Williams's question, refining it from something that started out in much blunter fashion.
Mr. Williams, seated at a long conference table with a dozen executives, editors and journalists from Fox News and The Wall Street Journal, initially argued for taking a hard line with Mr. Gingrich. He wanted to use the words "demeaning" and "racially charged" to describe comments by Mr. Gingrich, a former House speaker, that black Americans "should demand paychecks and not be satisfied with food stamps," and that poor children would benefit from working as janitors at their schools.
After Mr. Williams read the draft of his question, Bill Sammon, the managing editor of Fox News's Washington bureau, said he had concerns. "That sounds a little heavy," he said, suggesting that Mr. Williams use a softer approach. "I think if you go too strong on him, you're going to give him an escape hatch." Mr. Sammon's suggestion: use the word "insulting" to describe the speaker's words.
But Mr. Williams insisted that there was, in fact, something very demeaning about suggesting that blacks felt entitled to receive government assistance. "I think demeaning is a better word," he said. "It's the idea that black Americans are demanding food stamps."
Michael Clemente, Fox News' senior vice president for news, offered a compromise. "Juan, what if you said, 'Mr. Speaker, can't you see how that would be, at a minimum, insulting?'"
And that was how Mr. Williams delivered the question on Monday night. "Speaker Gingrich, you recently said black Americans should demand jobs, not food stamps. You also said poor kids lack a strong work ethic and proposed having them work as janitors in their schools. Can't you see that this is viewed, at a minimum, as insulting to all Americans, but particularly to black Americans?"
The question produced an emphatic response that was classic Gingrich. "No. I don't see that," he said. He then went on to say that President Obama had "put" more Americans on food stamps than any president in American history, a statement that is numerically true but ignores the depth of the recession Mr. Obama inherited and the fact that the president does not place anyone on social assistance. People apply for it.
"Now, I know among the politically correct, you're not supposed to use facts that are uncomfortable," Mr. Gingrich added. He and his campaign were so pleased with his response that they cut up sound bites from the exchange and turned them into an ad that they called "The Moment." The incident has been discussed repeatedly on talk radio and cable television ever since.
Mr. Williams, said in an interview on Wednesday morning that he was pleased with how the question turned out. "I think that it was best to try to make it as fact-based and neutral as possible without having me insert myself or my emotional response into the dialogue." He said that he and Fox executives had discussed the possibility that he would be booed during the question. He was.
"I don't mind getting booed," he said. "I'm a big boy."

HEADLINE: Clarity on Pipeline Decision, From North of the Border

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: On the Keystone XL oil pipeline decision, White House reporters get a little help -- in plain English -- from the office of Canada's prime minister. 

 BODY:
For White House reporters covering President Obama's controversial decision on Wednesday to reject, for now, the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, it helped to have a colleague reporting from the Canadian prime minister's office.
Reporters routinely complain that so-called readouts from the White House providing information on Mr. Obama's private calls or meetings with foreign leaders are mostly information-free. Wednesday's 31-word example -- on Mr. Obama's call to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a pipeline supporter, about his decision -- was more cryptic than most. But what really made it stand out was the contrast with the Canadian version that preceded it in Ottawa.
First, the Canadian readout:
"Earlier this afternoon, Prime Minister Stephen Harper received a phone call from Barack Obama, president of the United States. President Obama informed the prime minister of his administration's decision to turn down TransCanada's application to build and operate the Keystone XL pipeline. 
"The president explained that the decision was not a decision on the merits of the project and that it was without prejudice, meaning that TransCanada is free to reapply. Prime Minister Harper expressed his profound disappointment with the news. He indicated to President Obama that he hoped that this project would continue given the significant contribution it would make to jobs and economic growth both in Canada and the United States of America.
"The prime minister reiterated to the president that Canada will continue to work to diversify its energy exports."
(That final paragraph amounts to a veiled threat in diplomatic-speak - Mr. Harper's message that Canada will sell its tar sands oil somewhere regardless, probably China.)
And now, the White House readout:
"President Obama called Prime Minister Harper to personally convey his administration's decision on the Keystone pipeline. The president also reaffirmed the close alliance and friendship between the United States and Canada."

HEADLINE: Obama Fights Back Against Koch Brothers in New Ad

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: The ad is a rebuttal of a new television commercial being run by Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group. 

 BODY:
10:09 p.m. | Updated COLUMBIA, S.C. - Facing attacks on his character from some particularly aggressive and well-financed opponents,President Obama will begin running the first broadcast television ad of his presidential re-election campaign on Thursday.
To advertise so early in an election year is unusual. But it reflects the new reality of presidential politics, with large, anonymous amounts of money flowing into groups that can pay for potentially devastating advertising.
The president's campaign commercial is striking not only for its timing but for its sharply defensive tone toward a very specific target. Without mentioning them by name, it takes on Charles and David Koch, the wealthy conservative businessmen who have opposed Mr. Obama through the political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity.
Americans for Prosperity announced this week that it would run a $6 million national advertising campaign that portrays the president as running a pay-to-play government. It attacks him in a commercial that highlights the Solyndra scandal, which involved a solar power company with ties to the Obama administration that declared bankruptcy after receiving more than $500 million in federal money.
The Obama campaign responded hastily. It placed orders for television time on Wednesday, telling broadcast stations that it wanted the advertising on the air immediately. Typically, stations require more than a day's notice.
An official from the campaign said that the purchase of air time was significant, but as of Wednesday afternoon it had not placed orders widely, according to several television stations in battleground states.
The ad will run in four states that could prove pivotal in the election: Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia.
It opens with a shot at the Koch brothers. "Secretive oil billionaires attacking President Obama with ads fact checkers say are not tethered to the facts," an announcer says over the low chords of a piano as an image from the Americans for Prosperity advertisement plays in the background. "Independent watchdogs call this president's record on ethics unprecedented," it continues. "President Obama kept his promise to toughen ethics rules and strengthen America's energy economy."
Groups like Americans for Prosperity and American Crossroads have been airing advertising for months attacking the president, to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. This is the first time he has pushed back in a commercial.
 The ad coincides with what promises to be a major media blitz next week for the president. He is set to deliver his State of the Union speech on Tuesday. Then he will hit the road, traveling to Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Michigan and Nevada - all swing states his campaign is focusing on in the election.
That the ad came directly from the Obama campaign - and not from a "super PAC" supporting him - could indicate how differently the Republican and Democratic sides of the race will unfold. Attack ads in the Republican primary so far have been paid for overwhelmingly by super PACs. But the president - who recently announced that he had raised $68 million in the last three months of 2011 - is likely to have to do much of the hard hitting himself. His super PAC has so far failed to raise the amounts of money of its Republican counterparts.

HEADLINE: The United States Economy Through a Private Equity Lens

BYLINE: JESSE EISINGER


HIGHLIGHT: As Mitt Romney defends his tenure at Bain Capital on the presidential campaign trail, some on Wall Street wonder how running a private equity firm compares to running the country. 

 BODY:
Imagine how Mitt Romney would campaign if he actually ran as a private equity executive, dangerous though that may be in this era of the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street.
Aggressively attacked by a super PAC supporting Newt Gingrich, Mr. Romney stands accused of being a rapacious capitalist intent on destroying jobs for personal gain. Mr. Romney has responded: Au contraire! He argues that his work at Bain Capital, one of the earliest and most successful private equity firms, created jobs by making companies more efficient and successful.
 Many people on Wall Street are befuddled. After all, a private equity firm creating jobs is like Adam Sandler winning an Academy Award - it would be nice if it happened, but it sure wasn't the goal.
The goal, of course, is high returns.
If Mr. Romney were really running as a private equity executive, how would he view what his campaign regards as one of the nation's most pressing issues, the national debt
Right at the top of his campaign's home page, Mr. Romney proclaims, "We have a moral responsibility not to spend more than we take in." The United States' debt is such a problem, it's like an addiction: "The first step toward recovery is admitting we have a problem and refusing to allow any more irresponsible borrowing," his site says.
It's almost as if Mr. Romney never worked in - what's that other phrase for private equity? - oh yes, a leveraged buyout firm. Leverage as in debt, debt and more debt. Debt amplifies the returns of L.B.O. firms. Indeed, they often saddle companies with extra debt precisely so that their investors can cash out faster, a technique Bain deployed under Mr. Romney's watch.
L.B.O. firms certainly never think of debt as immoral. When the borrowing is good, private equity is going to grab the money. When Mr. Romney rails against debt, he is running away from his entire career in business.
So what about the federal government? The 10-year Treasury bond rate is 1.87 percent. Since inflation is higher than that, real rates are actually below zero, meaning that a lender to the United States government will get back less money in 10 years than it started with.
That's right: When the government borrows, its lenders actually lose money. Yet foreigners and Americans, institutions and individuals alike are extraordinarily willing to shovel money at the United States government right now.
Are there private equity executives anywhere in the world who would counsel their companies not to borrow at such extremely low rates? I haven't had the privilege of meeting one. Their mantra is, borrow now, for tomorrow the Mayans might turn out to be right. Few indeed are the companies that could borrow that cheaply and not make some kind of return on essentially free money.
"If debt is available to you historically cheaply, it almost always makes sense to take it," said Shivan Govindan, a private equity executive for the Resource Financial Institutions Group. "Your capital strategy isn't something ideological. You are going to optimize it for the best mix."
So, by the logic of private equity, the United States government should borrow much more right now.
But what about the unsustainability of our debt? If a company has out-of-control costs and is spiraling toward default, it should not borrow more. True, but no company that is truly headed toward imminent default can borrow as cheaply as the American government.
If the United States government is headed toward bankruptcy, lenders are surely not acting that way. Maybe those people are making a good decision; maybe they are deluded. It doesn't matter to the borrower.
Of course, an issue for the United States, as for a company, is whether it could put the money to good use.
"Surely, government investments would have a real return in a 10-year period higher than zero, even with waste and corruption," said Paul L. Kasriel, an economist for Northern Trust. "This means that these investments will boost future real G.D.P. growth, which will boost future tax revenues to service the increased debt."
There will be bridges and roads that we must fix over the next decade. We could put more young people in college, improve elementary school education, train veterans so they can find good jobs or finance exploration of alternative fuels. People will quibble - or maybe, in our polarized culture, fight tooth and nail - over the choices, but most could think of something that would be a good investment.
On a deeper level, the debate over private equity raises questions about using the metaphor of America as a business. That kind of thinking can reduce society to the sum of its revenues and profits, ignoring that much of what we do to provide for the common defense and promote the general welfare cannot or should not be measured, especially in economic terms. We take care of our elderly because it is the right thing to do, not because we expect a return on investment. Shouldn't society promote and protect freedom and human rights? Even when there are times when doing so may be expensive or uneconomical?
There are moral issues that confront our country. Debt isn't one of them.

HEADLINE: Governor Romney, Meet Governor Dukakis

BYLINE: ANDREW GELMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Why Mitt Romney will probably leap out ahead of President Obama. For a while. 

 BODY:
A couple of months ago, Mitt Romney was a hapless would-be frontrunner who couldn't stay ahead of a motley crew of unelectable cranks, extremists and vanity candidates. (There's some overlap in these categories.) Then he won the first two states. Now, ahead in the polls in South Carolina and Florida, Romney is on track for the Republican nomination in the worst election year for an incumbent party since - well, since 2008.
What happened isn't much of a surprise. The shopping period is over; the time for buying has begun. Buying, of course, refers to candidates running ads - Romney is willing and able to outspend his rivals here - and voters taking a hard look at the candidates. They must decide both who they would be comfortable with as president and who can win the election. 
What's next? No one can say for sure. Here's my guess, which might seem counterintuitive at first but is consistent with the history of previous presidential campaigns. I wouldn't be surprised if, once he has locked up the Republican nomination, Romney takes a big lead in a head-to-head matchup with Obama. 
After the primary contests are over, supporters of the other Republican candidates are likely to shift to Romney (just as Hillary Clinton voters had no problem voting for Obama once the 2008 primaries were definitively over). At the same time, Romney will have defined himself to the general public as the moderate opponent of unstable ultraconservatives like Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul, Rick Perry and Rick Santorum.
So I expect Romney will start the general election campaign with a healthy lead. During the campaign, though, Obama will have plenty of time to remind voters that Romney is a Republican. Romney has staked out conservative positions on just about all the major issues, and by the time the general election comes along, I'm sure the Obama campaign will have communicated this to voters. When November arrives, the election is likely to be close, and will depend on economic conditions, just as the experts have said all along.
If my scenario comes to pass, I expect we'll be hearing a lot in the spring and summer about Romney's political savvy, and then when the inevitable narrowing of the polls comes in the fall, we'll hear all about the ineptitude of his campaign. Really, though, it will just be voters working out where he stands on the issues.
Something similar happened in 1988. Out-party candidate Michael Dukakis emerged from the primary election season with a lead of as much as 15 points over the hapless George H. W. Bush, who on economics had never lived down his "voodoo economics" remark, on foreign policy was mocked for describing himself as "out of the loop" in the Iran-Contra affair, and who was portrayed on all sides as a man of no principles.
What happened? How did Dukakis slip from a solid lead to a resounding defeat? No, it wasn't because of his poor debate preparation, his negative charisma, or even that silly picture of him sitting in a tank. It wasn't anything he at all. In fact, Michael Dukakis performed about as well in the election as would be expected given economic conditions in 1988.
The real puzzle of the 1988 election is not how it ended up, but how it started. How did Dukakis have that big lead in the first place? We can't be sure, but our best guess is that Dukakis's strong start was a product of his long primary-election campaign against Jesse Jackson. Compared to Jackson, Dukakis was a political moderate. At the beginning of a general election campaign, voters are fluid in their preferences, and independents and even partisans on the other side are willing to take a look at a politically moderate alternative.
As the election neared, voters sorted themselves out according to party identification and ideology, and George H. W. Bush took advantage of the generally strong economic conditions that year.
The same thing happened with Jimmy Carter in 1976. He started the general election campaign as everybody's acceptable choice, 30 points ahead of Gerald Ford, but by November, the candidates were essentially tied.
I'm not saying that Romney will follow in Dukakis's footsteps and actually lose. Economic conditions for the incumbent party seem likely to be worse in 2012 than they were in 1988. But however the general election plays out, the situation now seems ripe for Romney to begin his campaign against Obama with a large, temporary lead in the polls, a gap that should neither drive Democrats to despair nor lull Republicans into complacency.

HEADLINE: Russian Says Western Support for Arab Revolts Could Cause a 'Big War'

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY and MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, warned Wednesday that outside encouragement of antigovernment uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa could lead to ''a very big war that will cause suffering not only to countries in the region, but also to states far beyond its boundaries.''
Mr. Lavrov's annual news conference was largely devoted to a critique of Western policies in Iran and Syria, which he said could lead to a spiral of violence. 
His remarks came on the heels of a report on state-controlled television that accused the American ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, who has been in Moscow for less than a week, of working to provoke a revolution here. Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, at an impromptu meeting with prominent editors, also unleashed an attack on the liberal radio station Ekho Moskvy, which he said was serving American interests.
Mr. Lavrov said Russia would use its position on the United Nations Security Council to veto any United Nations authorization of military strikes against the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. The United Nations has repeatedly called for Syria end a crackdown on opposition demonstrators, which Arab League monitors say resulted in hundreds of deaths over the past month.
''If someone conceives the idea of using force at any cost -- and I've already heard calls for sending some Arab troops to Syria -- we are unlikely to be able to prevent this,'' Mr. Lavrov said. ''But this should be done on their own initiative and should remain on their conscience. They won't get any authorization from the Security Council.''
Mr. Lavrov said foreign governments were arming ''militants and extremists'' in Syria, and he gave a bristling response to Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador to the United Nations, who on Tuesday expressed concern about possible Russian arms shipments to Syria.
''We don't find it necessary to explain or justify anything,'' Mr. Lavrov said. ''We are only trading goods with Syria that are not prohibited by international law.''
Mr. Lavrov offered a similarly grave message about the possibility of a military strike against Iran, which he said would be a ''catastrophe.'' He said sanctions now being proposed against Tehran were ''intended to have a smothering effect on the Iranian economy and the Iranian population, probably in the hopes of provoking discontent.''
Relations between Moscow and Washington have worsened over the past year, as the cordial tone of the ''reset'' between President Obama and President Dmitri A. Medvedev has been replaced by a drumbeat of criticism. Mr. Lavrov said that Russia and the United States were not adversaries, and that ''the cold war ended a long time ago.'' By contrast, however, he was glowing about Russia's cooperation with China, which he said was ''the highest in the history of our bilateral relationship.''
Late on Tuesday night, Russia's Channel 1 broadcast a segment about Mr. McFaul, who is one of Mr. Obama's top advisers on Russia and a primary architect of the relationship's reset. The commentary emphasized Mr. McFaul's relationship with opposition leaders and suggested that his intent was to lay the groundwork for revolution.
''McFaul is not a specialist on Russia,'' said Mikhail V. Leontyev, a Channel 1 commentator. ''He is a specialist solely in the promotion of democracy.'' Singling out a book by Mr. McFaul, titled ''Russia's Unfinished Revolution,'' Mr. Leontyev added: ''Is it possible Mr. McFaul came to Russia to work in his specialty? That is, to finish the revolution?''
The segment delved into Mr. McFaul's previous work in Russia, including a stint in the 1990s with the National Democratic Institute, an organization that Mr. Leontyev said was ''known for its proximity to the American intelligence services and its work preparing the political leaders of the third world.'' Mr. McFaul should have ''no problems'' forging relationships with the opposition, Mr. Leontyev said. ''Cooperating with the government is another story.''
The commentary followed news coverage on Channel 1 showing opposition leaders who visited the American Embassy to meet with Mr. McFaul. In the video, which was uploaded to YouTube with the title ''Receiving Instructions at the United States Embassy,'' people accost the opposition leaders on the sidewalk and ask: ''Why did you come to the embassy today? What are your reasons for coming?''
Mr. McFaul dismissed the criticism of his meeting with the opposition figures, noting that he had already met with several high-ranking Russian officials.
''U.S. officials visiting Russia make a point of meeting with both government officials and civil society leaders,'' he wrote on his blog in Russian and English.
The theme of American interference emerged again during a rapidly convened meeting between top journalists and Mr. Putin, which ended in a confrontation between the prime minister and Aleksei A. Venediktov, the editor of the radio station Ekho Moskvy. The station is an important platform for the opposition, and Mr. Putin said he had been horrified when he happened to hear a broadcast that contended that a planned United States missile defense system posed no great threat to Russia.
''Listen, it was such bull, I just don't know -- where do they get this stuff?'' Mr. Putin said. ''I thought, This is not information -- what they're broadcasting, it's serving the foreign policy interests of one country with respect to another, to Russia.''
''I do not take offense when you pour diarrhea on me day in and day out, and yet you have taken offense,'' Mr. Putin told Mr. Venediktov as the meeting came to a close, according to an official transcript. ''I just said two words, and you took offense.''

HEADLINE: When the Lights Go Down in the City

BYLINE: By SCOTT LASSER. 
Scott Lasser is the author of the forthcoming novel ''Say Nice Things About Detroit.''

 BODY:
Los Angeles
BACK when I was growing up in Detroit, a bumper sticker appeared that read, ''Will the last person out of Michigan please turn out the lights?''
It was supposed to be a joke.
Now they are turning out the lights. Cash-strapped Highland Park, Mich., has not only darkened two-thirds of its streetlamps, but removed them. Detroit is teetering on the brink of financial takeover by the state. Mayor Dave Bing plans to raze 10,000 empty structures; he also intends to provide full city services only to the more viable neighborhoods. This makes sense when you consider that Detroit has lost a quarter of its population in just the last decade, and around a million inhabitants in my lifetime.
Roughly half the attendees at my recent high school reunion now live outside of Detroit. Detroiters tend to chart with pride the success of Detroiters in the wider world (Eminem or Aretha Franklin, say, or a behind-the-scenes success like Jerry Bruckheimer), and at the reunion it was no different. A friend said, ''Pretty much everyone who left looks to be doing better than those who stayed.'' Maybe this was so. After all, almost everyone who left the city did so for a job. But many would like to return. 
Detroit's troubles are self-evident. What's harder to understand is what Detroit looks like to its citizens and the members, like myself, of the Detroit diaspora. For us, the city is not a symbol of despair or decay, but a source, believe it or not, of hope.
I've lived all over the country, and the idea that Detroit is somehow different, that what has happened there can't happen anywhere else, seems faulty at best. Drive the bumpy streets of Los Angeles, wait for a subway in New York or pay income tax in Chicago, and you learn that there are budget problems everywhere. The troubles in Detroit seem worse simply because Detroit has fallen so far.
Once the center of American industrial might and economic power, Detroit was, from 1920 to 1950, the country's fourth most populous city. It called itself, without irony, the Paris of the Midwest. When I was a kid, my dad worked in steel and then as a Ford buyer, a midlevel job that provided a decent living, free medical care and, of course, cars. My stepfather had been temporarily paralyzed in a kamikaze attack at the end of World War II, but he recovered, put on a suit and went into the steel business. ''You couldn't help but make money,'' he told me. ''It must have been like selling drugs today.''
The exact causes of Detroit's decline are still open to debate, but suffice it to say mismanagement within the auto industry, racial strife and bad, often confrontational and sometimes corrupt government played major roles. When General Motors and Chrysler finally succumbed to bankruptcy, it was the result of excessive debt and promises to retirees that could not be met. That may sound like someplace else, but our federal government is running an annual deficit of over a trillion dollars, and will have around $40 trillion in unfunded retiree liabilities. Detroit is not someplace else; it's America.
Are we doomed? Hardly. But to go forward we might do well to look at, well, Detroit. The city simply has no time left to dither or filibuster or ignore a problem because the solution is unpleasant. If Detroit needs to turn off the lights, they're going off. If it needs to raze decrepit buildings, it will fire up the bulldozers. This is a city where, once, I met a Ford man who had just turned down a lucrative job with a management consulting company. ''I can't work for a company that doesn't make something,'' he explained.
Detroit is a city used to the hard work of creation. It reminds us that necessity is the mother not only of invention, but of hope. And hope is necessary for action.
And Detroit is moving forward. There's a long way to go, but the city's efforts have already brought an influx of young artists and entrepreneurs drawn by cheap rent and programs that provide start-up capital. A lot of brainpower is being deployed to imagine the Detroit of the future. Crime is down overall. Even the auto business is coming back to life, as witnessed by the excitement at this year's Detroit auto show.
Detroit has been in dire straits before. In 1805, roughly a century before Henry Ford built his first assembly line, a huge fire burned the city to the ground. This gave rise to Detroit's Latin motto, ''Speramus meliora; resurget cineribus'' -- ''We hope for better things; it will rise from the ashes.''

HEADLINE: Web Rises Up To Deflect Bills Seen as Threat

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When the powerful world of old media mobilized to win passage of an online antipiracy bill, it marshaled the reliable giants of K Street -- the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Recording Industry Association of America and, of course, the motion picture lobby, with its new chairman, former Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat and an insider's insider.
Yet on Wednesday this formidable old guard was forced to make way for the new as Web powerhouses backed by Internet activists rallied opposition to the legislation through Internet blackouts and cascading criticism, sending an unmistakable message to lawmakers grappling with new media issues: Don't mess with the Internet.
As a result, the legislative battle over two once-obscure bills to combat the piracy of American movies, music, books and writing on the World Wide Web may prove to be a turning point for the way business is done in Washington. It represented a moment when the new economy rose up against the old. 
''I think it is an important moment in the Capitol,'' said Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California and an important opponent of the legislation. ''Too often, legislation is about competing business interests. This is way beyond that. This is individual citizens rising up.''
It appeared by Wednesday evening that Congress would follow Bank of America, Netflix and Verizon as the latest institution to change course in the face of a netizen revolt.
Legislation that just weeks ago had overwhelming bipartisan support and had provoked little scrutiny generated a grass-roots coalition on the left and the right. Wikipedia made its English-language content unavailable, replaced with a warning: ''Right now, the U.S. Congress is considering legislation that could fatally damage the free and open Internet.'' Visitors to Reddit found the site offline in protest. Google's home page was scarred by a black swatch that covered the search engine's label.
Phone calls and e-mail messages poured in to Congressional offices against the Stop Online Piracy Act in the House and the Protect I.P. Act in the Senate. One by one, prominent backers of the bills dropped off.
First, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a rising Republican star, took to Facebook, one of the vehicles for promoting opposition, to renounce a bill he had co-sponsored. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who leads the G.O.P.'s Senate campaign efforts, used Facebook to urge his colleagues to slow the bill down. Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina and a Tea Party favorite, announced his opposition on Twitter, which was already boiling over with anti-#SOPA and #PIPA fever.
Then trickle turned to flood -- adding Senators Mark Kirk of Illinois and Roy Blunt of Missouri, and Representatives Lee Terry of Nebraska and Ben Quayle of Arizona. At least 10 senators and nearly twice that many House members announced their opposition.
''Thanks for all the calls, e-mails, and tweets. I will be opposing #SOPA and #PIPA,'' Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, wrote in a Twitter message. Late Wednesday, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, withdrew his support for a bill he helped write.
The existing bill ''needs more due diligence, analysis and substantial changes,'' he said in a statement.
Few lawmakers even now question the need to combat pirates at Web sites in China, Russia and elsewhere who have offered free American movies, television shows, music and books almost as soon as they are released. Heavyweights like the Walt Disney Company secured the support of senators and representatives before the Web companies were even aware the legislation existed.
''A lot of people are pitching this as Hollywood versus Google. It's so much more than that,'' said Maura Corbett, spokeswoman for NetCoalition, which represents Google, Amazon.com, Yahoo, eBay and other Web companies. ''I would love to say we're so fabulous, we're just that good, but we're not. The Internet responded the way only the Internet could.''
For the more traditional media industry, the moment was menacing. Supporters of the legislation accused the Web companies of willfully lying about the legislation's flaws, stirring fear to protect ill-gotten profits from illegal Web sites.
Mr. Dodd said Internet companies might well change Washington, but not necessarily for the better with their ability to spread their message globally, without regulation or fact-checking.
''It's a new day,'' he added. ''Brace yourselves.''
Citing two longtime liberal champions of the First Amendment, Senator Patrick Leahy and Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, Mr. Dodd fumed, ''No one can seriously believe Pat Leahy and John Conyers can be backing legislation to block free speech or break the Internet.''
For at least four years, Hollywood studios, recording industry and major publishing houses have pressed Congress to act against offshore Web sites that have been giving away U.S. movies, music and books as fast as the artists can make them. Few lawmakers would deny the threat posed by piracy to industries that have long been powerful symbols of American culture and have become engines of the export economy. The Motion Picture Association of America says its industry brings back more export income than aerospace, automobiles or agriculture, and that piracy costs the country as many as 100,000 jobs.
The House response, SOPA, was drafted by a conservative Republican, Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, with the backing of 30 co-sponsors, from Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, to mainline Republican Peter King of New York. The Senate's version, written by Mr. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, attracted 40 co-sponsors from across the political spectrum and cleared his committee unanimously.
Then the Web rose up. Activists said the legislation would censor the Web, force search engines to play policemen for a law they hate and cripple innovation in one of the most vibrant sectors of the American economy.
Mr. Smith, the House Republican author, said opposition Web sites were spreading ''fear rather than fact.''
''When the opposition is based upon misinformation, I have confidence in the facts and confidence that the facts will ultimately prevail,'' Mr. Smith said.
Google, Facebook and Twitter have political muscle of their own, with in-house lobbying shops and trade associations just like traditional media's. Facebook has hired the former Clinton White House press secretary Joe Lockhart. Google's Washington operations are headed by Pablo Chavez, a former counsel to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and a veteran of the Senate Commerce Committee.
And for all the campaign contributions, Washington parties and high-priced lobbyists the old economy could muster, nothing could compare to the tentacles the new economy can reach into Americans' everyday lives through sites like Wikipedia. Aides to Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, say he will press forward with a vote Tuesday to open debate on the Protect I.P. bill. Negotiators from both parties are scrambling for new language that could assuage the concerns of the Internet community, but expectations are that the bill will now fail to get the 60 votes to move forward -- a significant setback.
''The problem for the content industry is they just don't know how to mobilize people,'' said John P. Feehery, a former House Republican leadership aide who previously worked at the motion picture association. ''They have a small group of content makers, a few unions, whereas the Internet world, the social media world especially, can reach people in ways we never dreamed of before.''

HEADLINE: Brown Asks California To Cheer Rail Project

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Jerry Brown on Wednesday threw his unequivocal support behind a $100 billion high-speed rail line that has come under fire here in California and across the country, embracing it in a strikingly optimistic State of the State speech in which he asserted that government should pursue ambitious ventures even during times of economic strife. 
With his speech, Mr. Brown firmly linked his political fortunes to the proposed 520-mile bullet train connecting San Francisco and Los Angeles as he urged lawmakers to release the $9 billion in state bonds needed to begin the project this year. His focus on the train line, along with a new emphasis on dealing with the state's water problems, suggested that Mr. Brown was trying to turn the page after a year in which the legacy of his second turn as governor seemed in danger of being defined by a series of budget battles and spending cuts.
He made clear that the state's fiscal problems were hardly behind it: Mr. Brown, a Democrat, formally called for putting before voters in November an initiative that would temporarily increase income taxes on the wealthy and sales taxes. And signaling a potential point of conflict with Democratic lawmakers, the governor said he would insist on further cuts to balance the budget if the tax initiative failed.
Still, Mr. Brown's speech, coming after five economically tumultuous years here, was notable for its optimism.
''Every decade since the '60s, dystopian journalists write stories on the impending decline of our economy, our culture and our politics,'' he said, adding: ''California has problems, but rumors of its demise are greatly exaggerated.''
Mr. Brown championed the rail project at a time when it has seemed increasingly endangered. The cost has doubled to $98.5 billion. The notion of starting the work in a sparsely populated section of the state has been ridiculed. And support for rail projects in Congress has all but died.
This month, an independent review panel created under state law raised questions about the financial feasibility of the plan and urged lawmakers to delay it. Within days, Mr. Brown pushed through a shake-up at the California High-Speed Rail Authority, the agency overseeing the project.
''Critics of the high-speed rail project abound, as they often do when something of this magnitude is proposed,'' he said in his speech, adding: ''The Panama Canal was for years thought to be impractical, and Benjamin Disraeli himself said of the Suez Canal, 'Totally impossible to be carried out.' The critics were wrong then, and they're wrong now.''
State Senator Ted W. Lieu, a Democrat, called the train ''a symbol of what California can do,'' but suggested that the project was as much about Mr. Brown as anything else.
''He is a much more practical governor now than maybe 30 years ago,'' Mr. Lieu said. ''But he is still a dreamer. High-speed rail is very evocative and is one of those things that I think he would like to be part of his legacy.''

HEADLINE: The False Ideals of the Web

BYLINE: By JARON LANIER


HIGHLIGHT: Jaron Lanier is the author of ''You Are Not a Gadget: A Manifesto'' and a researcher at Microsoft Research, but these views are his alone.

 BODY:
Berkeley, Calif.
WE who love the Internet love the fact that so many people contribute to it. It's hard to believe that skeptics once worried about whether anyone would have anything worthwhile to say online.
There is, however, an outdated brand of digital orthodoxy that ought to be retired. In this worldview, the Internet is a never-ending battle of good guys who love freedom against bad guys like old-fashioned Hollywood media moguls. The bad guys want to strengthen copyright law, and make it impossible to post anonymously copied videos and stories.
The proposed Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, which is being considered in the House while the Senate looks at a similar bill, is deemed the worst thing ever. Popular sites like Wikipedia staged a blackout on Wednesday to protest the bills. Google put a black banner over its name. Nothing quite like that has ever happened before. This is extraordinary, because it shows that belief in the priority of fighting SOPA is so absolute as to trump the stated nonpartisan missions of these sites. 
The legislation has indeed included draconian remedies in various drafts, so I join my colleagues in criticizing the bills. But our opposition has become so extreme that we are doing more harm than good to our own cause. Those rare tech companies that have come out in support of SOPA are not merely criticized but barred from industry events and subject to boycotts. We, the keepers of the flame of free speech, are banishing people for their speech. The result is a chilling atmosphere, with people afraid to speak their minds.
Our melodrama is driven by a vision of an open Internet that has already been distorted, though not by the old industries that fear piracy.
For instance, until a year ago, I enjoyed a certain kind of user-generated content very much: I participated in forums in which musicians talked about musical instruments.
For years, I was warned that old-fashioned control freaks like media moguls might separate me from my beloved forums. Perhaps a forum would be shut down because it was hosted on some server with pirated content.
While acknowledging that this is a possible scenario, a very different factor -- proprietary social networking -- is ending my freedom to participate in the forums I used to love, at least on terms I accept. Like many other forms of contact, the musical conversations are moving into private sites, particularly Facebook. To continue to participate, I'd have to accept Facebook's philosophy, under which it analyzes me, and is searching for new ways to charge third parties for the use of that analysis.
At the moment that wouldn't bother me much, because I know a lot of people at Facebook and I know they are decent. But I've seen what happens to companies over time. Who knows who will be using my data in 20 years?
You might object that it's all based on individual choice. That argument ignores the consequences of networks, and the way they function. After a certain point choice is reduced.
And it's not Facebook's fault! We, the idealists, insisted that information be able to flow freely online, which meant that services relating to information, instead of the information itself, would be the main profit centers. Some businesses do sell content, but that doesn't address the business side of everyday user-generated content.
The adulation of ''free content'' inevitably meant that ''advertising'' would become the biggest business in the open part of the information economy. Furthermore, that system isn't so welcoming to new competitors. Once networks are established, it is hard to reduce their power. Google's advertisers, for instance, know what will happen if they move away. The next-highest bidder for each position in Google's auction-based model for selling ads will inherit that position if the top bidder goes elsewhere. So Google's advertisers tend to stay put because the consequences of leaving are obvious to them, whereas the opportunities they might gain by leaving are not.
The obvious strategy in the fight for a piece of the advertising pie is to close off substantial parts of the Internet so Google doesn't see it all anymore. That's how Facebook hopes to make money, by sealing off a huge amount of user-generated information into a separate, non-Google world. Networks lock in their users, whether it is Facebook's members or Google's advertisers.
This belief in ''free'' information is blocking future potential paths for the Internet. What if ordinary users routinely earned micropayments for their contributions? If all content were valued instead of only mogul content, perhaps an information economy would elevate success for all. But under the current terms of debate that idea can barely be whispered.
To my friends in the ''open'' Internet movement, I have to ask: what did you think would happen? We in Silicon Valley undermined copyright to make commerce become more about services instead of content -- more about our code instead of their files. The inevitable endgame was always that we would lose control of our own personal content, our own files. We haven't just weakened Hollywood and old-fashioned publishers. We've weakened ourselves.

HEADLINE: Factory Output Fuels Growth in U.S.

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Factory production in the United States has surged 15 percent above its lows of two and a half years ago and is helping drive the economy's recovery. 
A jump in manufacturing output last month coincided with other data suggesting that the economy began 2012 with renewed vigor, and another report shows that wholesale prices are tame.
There appear to be signs ''that manufacturing in the U.S. is gaining global market share,'' said John Ryding of RDQ Economics, ''and this could be an important dynamic supporting growth in 2012.''
Manufacturing rose 0.9 percent from November to December, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday. It was the biggest monthly gain since December 2010.
Overall output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities increased 0.4 percent. Warm weather reduced demand for energy produced by utilities.
Over the last year, factory output has risen 3.7 percent. Factories benefited in particular in the second half of 2011 from several trends. People bought more cars. Businesses spent more on industrial machinery and computers before a tax incentive expired. And companies restocked their supplies after cutting them last summer.
The growth has also fueled more hiring. Factories added 23,000 jobs in December, the most since July. That helped reduce the unemployment rate to 8.5 percent, the lowest level in nearly three years.
Still, Europe's debt crisis has begun to dampen demand for American exports. That trend, should it continue, could slow manufacturing and threaten growth this year.
December's gains suggest the industry ''is still resistant to the apparent slowdown in growth elsewhere, particularly in Europe,'' said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist with Capital Economics.
Businesses are starting to see some relief from high prices for energy and food, and that should benefit consumers later this year.
The Producer Price Index declined 0.1 percent in December, the Labor Department said Wednesday. The index measures price changes before they reach consumers.
Core wholesale prices, which exclude costs for food and energy, rose more sharply in December -- 0.3 percent. But economists played down the increase. They cited temporary factors that had pushed auto prices down in October and November.
Over all, wholesale prices are trending lower. They increased 4.8 percent in December compared with the same month a year ago, reflecting in part the effect of higher oil and other commodity prices. Even so, it is the slowest annual increase since January and down from 7.1 percent in July.
Falling prices for oil and agricultural commodities have lowered the cost of food and gas.
Gas prices have turned upward in recent months, but economists do not expect that to worsen inflation this year because prices will most likely be lower than last winter and spring, when political turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East sent prices up.
Lower wholesale costs mean manufacturers and retailers face less pressure to raise prices for consumers to maintain profits. That could keep consumer price inflation in check.
Lower inflation also gives the Federal Reserve leeway to keep short-term interest rates low and take other steps, if necessary, to bolster the economy.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Charges Banker With Misleading Investors

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
A Florida banker who is known for tangling with his critics, including with a prominent bank analyst during the financial crisis, was charged by federal regulators on Wednesday with misleading investors about his company's real estate portfolio as the housing market turned south.
Alan B. Levan, chairman and chief executive of BankAtlantic Bancorp, was accused of making misleading statements in public filings and on earnings calls in 2007 in order to hide mounting losses in much of the portfolio, which consisted of loans on large tracts of land intended for real estate development. The Securities and Exchange Commission complaint also names BankAtlantic Bancorp, the holding company for BankAtlantic, one of Florida's largest banks. 
The complaint says that Mr. Levan and the company committed accounting fraud when they ''schemed to minimize BankAtlantic's losses on their books by improperly recording loans they were trying to sell from this portfolio in late 2007.''
In a statement, Robert Khuzami, director of enforcement at the S.E.C., said that ''BankAtlantic and Levan used accounting gimmicks to conceal from investors the losses in a critical loan portfolio.''
''This is exactly the type of information that is important to investors,'' he said, ''and corporate executives who fail to make that required disclosure will face severe consequences.''
Eugene Stearns, a lawyer for Mr. Levan and BankAtlantic's holding company, said that the S.E.C.'s case was an example of ''scapegoating'' and that the company's financial disclosures were adequate. He said that in the fall of 2007, the company voluntarily issued extra disclosures about the risk classifications of its loans and that even before that, the bank company was clear about its risk profile.
Mr. Stearns said that all of the bank regulators overseeing the company had taken the position that banks should not release details about the risk classifications on loans.
''There's a war going on between banking agencies and the S.E.C.,'' Mr. Stearns said, noting that bank regulators wanted less disclosure and the S.E.C., which watches out for investors in the public markets, wanted more.
This is not the first case of a bank executive blaming regulators. Michael W. Perry, the former chief executive of IndyMac, the failed California bank, is being sued by the S.E.C. and has also said in defense documents that some of his accounting decisions were approved by regulators.
Mr. Levan and BankAtlantic were featured in a 2010 New York Times article about the company's battle with an analyst, Richard X. Bove. BankAtlantic sued Mr. Bove over a report he wrote at the height of financial crisis evaluating the health of a long list of banks, including the Florida bank. The report -- titled ''Who Is Next?'' appeared just after IndyMac collapsed, and as bank investors fled from bank stocks.
Mr. Bove at the time said that he had to fight the suit to protect the interests of analysts to freely produce their research reports. The bank and Mr. Bove settled.
On Wednesday after the S.E.C. filed its case, Mr. Bove said he did not feel vindicated because he had $700,000 in legal fees. ''There's no vindication if all you did was walk away with a huge hole in your pocket,'' he said.
According to the S.E.C. complaint, Mr. Levan knew in early 2007 that the loan portfolio had problems because borrowers were not able to make payments.
The complaint says that both Mr. Levan, who grew BankAtlantic into Florida's second largest bank over a more than two-decade banking career, and the company knew that many loans had been internally downgraded to ''nonpassing status,'' reflecting deep concern by the bank. Nevertheless, BankAtlantic's public filings for the first two quarters of 2007 made only general warnings about the dangers of Florida's real estate downturn.
The problems were finally disclosed in the third quarter of 2007 when BankAtlantic announced an unexpected loss, causing its stock to drop 37 percent, the complaint says.
BankAtlantic said in November that it would sell its branches, some loans, and deposits to BB&T Corporation.

HEADLINE: A New Fight On Licenses For Illegal Immigrants

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

 BODY:
SANTA FE, N.M. -- It is legislative season in New Mexico, which means it is time once again to debate whether illegal immigrants should be granted driver's licenses.
For the third straight session, Gov. Susana Martinez, a Republican, will be pushing to repeal a nearly decade-old law that allows New Mexico residents who are in this country illegally to obtain the licenses.
Debate over the issue has not only bitterly divided lawmakers in the state -- one of only two that permits illegal immigrants to get the same licenses as citizens -- it has also become a recurring theme of Ms. Martinez's tenure. 
This year's legislative session, which convened Tuesday, promises to be no different as both sides gear up for another contentious battle over the issue.
''The policy of giving driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, which nearly every other state has repealed or opposed, leads to fraud, human trafficking, organized crime and significant security concerns,'' said Scott Darnell, a spokesman for Ms. Martinez, who gave a nod to the repeal efforts in her State of the State address on Tuesday.
''The issue has been debated long enough; it doesn't take much time for lawmakers to vote to repeal this dangerous law,'' Mr. Darnell said.
But opponents are vowing to beat back the first-term governor's latest efforts, and say her fixation on the issue has spawned an environment of fear among immigrants in New Mexico.
''I think voters are pretty tired of this issue,'' said Marcela Diaz, executive director of Somos Un Pueblo Unido, a New Mexico immigrant advocacy group. ''We know New Mexicans care about jobs and the economy and not wedge issues and this kind of political posturing.''
Supporters of the current policy say it helps reduce unlicensed drivers and fosters cooperation between law enforcement and immigrants. A coalition of groups plans to converge on the State Capitol here on Tuesday to protest the proposed repeal.
Aside from New Mexico, Washington State also allows illegal immigrants to have driver's licenses. Utah allows illegal immigrants to get a driving privilege card, but the document cannot be used as government identification.
It is still unclear if this year's bill has the votes to pass the New Mexico Legislature, which is controlled by Democrats. Last year, repeal legislation cleared the House but was defeated in the Senate, and efforts to revive the bill in a special session failed.
But there are rumblings that some lawmakers who have opposed the repeal might change their minds.
''We have an election coming up,'' said State Representative Andy Nunez, an independent from Hatch and the bill's sponsor. ''I think legislators will take into account that if the majority of their constituents tell them to vote for it, I think they're going to vote for it.''
Mr. Nunez cited a 2010 poll in The Albuquerque Journal that found 72 percent of New Mexican voters surveyed did not support the current law.
Still, this year's debate promises to be particularly heated. Over the summer, Ms. Martinez's administration sent 10,000 letters to foreign citizens with New Mexico driver's licenses, seeking proof of residency. The letters followed a rash of scams aimed at getting local licenses for immigrants living outside the state.
About a third of the letters were returned as undeliverable, raising suspicion of fraud, Mr. Darnell said.
A state judge temporarily halted the program after the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed a lawsuit claiming the review was unconstitutional. Arguments are expected this year.
Last week, the legal defense group filed a separate lawsuit in state court on behalf of a woman who worked at the Motor Vehicle Division in Albuquerque. The woman claimed she was not allowed to translate the letters for Spanish-speaking foreign citizens and said she was fired after complaining about how the immigrants were treated.
''It's incredibly divisive, and on top of that, it also has created an atmosphere of hostility for many New Mexicans with lawful status and without lawful status,'' said David Hinojosa, the group's Southwest regional counsel, of Ms. Martinez's repeal efforts.
Demesia Padilla, secretary for the New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department, characterized the lawsuit as being filed by a political special interest group ''in their quest to defend a policy of giving driver's licenses to illegal immigrants that most New Mexicans find to be indefensible.''
In a statement, she said the woman's claims were false and described her as a part-time employee with a poor work record.
Mr. Nunez said that he planned to introduce the driver's license repeal bill this week.

HEADLINE: You Can Fall Out of Bed And Look Good

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
GOODBYE, lip liners, brow pencils, spackled-on foundations. The hottest beauty trend of 2012 is imperfection.
The new look for the new year is effortless, minimalist, just-out-of-bed-with-your-lover, according to leading hair and makeup artists. They say that stiff coiffures, overdone eyes, defined lips and matte skin are out. Tousled hair, smudged eyeliner, dewy lips and luminous skin are in.
The look is ''coming home from the party,'' not ''going out to the party,'' said Terry Barber, director of makeup artistry for MAC Cosmetics. ''Perfection got slightly boring.'' 
And the must-have tool to achieve perfect imperfection is recession-friendly: your fingertips. Use them to smudge eyeliner, smear bronzer, press bright stains into your cheeks and lips. The application of the makeup is as relaxed as the overall look.
''Pout your lip and just push it into the lip,'' advised Matin Maulawizada, the global artistry director for Laura Mercier whose handiwork will be on display at the Pamella Roland runway show next month during New York Fashion Week. ''It should look underdone.''
Emily Kate Warren, a member of Dick Page's Shiseido fashion runway team who has also done makeup for Yoko Ono and Jennifer Jason Leigh, calls the 2012 lip ''Popsicle mouth'' because it appears as if the wearer has been sucking an ice pop. (A variation of the mouth was seen at the Viktor & Rolf spring 2012 runway show.)
To achieve the Popsicle, Ms. Warren advised forgoing lip liners and wands and applying a swab of bright color in the center of the lips, then pressing them together and rolling. ''The darkest gradation should be in the center and should blast out to nothing,'' she said, adding that the technique is also a way for women timid about sporting a high-wattage lip to try electric orange or red.
Another beauty buzzword for 2012 is restraint. Experts said makeup should not be applied to the entire face. Under-eye circles and blemishes may be covered with concealer, but the rest of the skin should be left natural, a la Ali MacGraw in ''Love Story.'' If you wear a dark lip, then keep the rest of your skin polished, like Tilda Swinton. Brows are natural, not cartoon geometric.
To embrace the moment, skip mascara, like Lady Gaga did in the fall, or try mascara in, say, blond or red to match your hair color. Lori Hamlin, a New York City makeup artist who counts the lissome cooking personality Padma Lakshmi among her clients, said she likes Yves Saint Laurent's Mascara Volume Effet Faux Clils in burgundy.
Even that old standby, the smoky eye, is out of vogue.
''Lose the smoky eyes,'' said Mr. Barber of MAC. For a fresh look, he suggests swiping brown mascara just on the roots of your eyelashes, then dotting a bit of brown pencil in between (he likes MAC Coffee eye pencil). This year, texture, like metallic or wet eyelids, is all the rage. The total effect, he said, is ''modern pared-down glam rock.''
Ms. Hamlin agreed. ''The smoky eye will never go out of style, but a different way to use it is to use the metallic tones,'' she said. ''It just makes it a little bit softer.''
Another updated option is to almost reverse the smoky eye by applying shadow and liner below the bottom lash line instead of on the lid, according to Ms. Warren. On her own eyes she draws a haphazard pencil line below her lower lashes, then smudges it with her finger, for a look similar to one worn by the models at Alexander Wang's spring 2012 runway show.
To those in the habit of ringing their eyes with liner, she suggests easing up and just lining the eyes from the outer corners to the middle, like the models at the spring 2012 Dolce & Gabbana show.
This summer, expect to see even more 1970s glam-rock inspiration, with makeup in aqua and gray, which Mr. Maulawizada of Laura Mercier said is making a comeback. ''All of it's done in a very understated way,'' he said.
But before then, spring will bring a few darker hues, like mauve. ''It just kind of reflects the times,'' Mr. Maulawizada said, referring to the grim economy and pop-culture references. ''You see shows about mysticism, the occult, vampires.''
One place to avoid trends, vampiric or glam rock: your eyebrows.
''Eyebrows should not be trendy,'' said Anastasia Soare, the eyebrow guru who has tamed the brows of Oprah, Madonna and Naomi Campbell.
While brows should be groomed in a way that is most becoming to your face, Ms. Soare said, you can experiment with color. The heavier the eye makeup, the lighter the brows. (She recommends using tinted eyebrow gel instead of bleach, as the latter can turn brows orange). With a minimal makeup look, she said, go for bold, dark brows.
''You must have balance,'' Ms. Soare said. ''You cannot be like a Christmas tree.''
Hair should complement the casual, natural look: a simple ponytail, a chignon, a bun you plop atop your head as you wash your face in the morning.
No matter the style, to be au courant, hair must be conditioned and shiny. But shiny hair doesn't necessarily mean clean hair.
''Make a hair resolution for 2012,'' said Oscar Blandi, the stylist who has tended to the locks of Jennifer Garner, Jessica Alba and Kelly Ripa. ''Make sure you don't wash your hair every day.''
A hair glaze at least once a month is essential, he said, especially for men (who he said request it more than women) because it seals cuticles, making gray hairs at the temples appear brighter and thicker.
These beauty indulgences make such a difference, said Mr. Blandi, that New Yorkers opt for them even in the current economy.
''You may have no money in your pocket,'' he said, ''but you feel like a million dollars.''
