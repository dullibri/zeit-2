HEADLINE: The Hidden Majority of For-Profit Colleges

BYLINE: JUDITH SCOTT-CLAYTON


HIGHLIGHT: A study indicates that the number of students at for-profit colleges is vastly understated by the government, and raises questions about whether federal aid provides institutions with a lever to increase tuition, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Whether you support or oppose the growing role of the for-profit sector in postsecondary education, you probably don't know the half of it. Literally.
A new study by the economists Stephanie Riegg Cellini of George Washington University and Claudia Goldin of Harvard concludes that the estimated number of for-profit institutions in the United States would more than double - to more than 7,500 from 2,944 - if official statistics included institutions that do not receive federal student aid.
Most statistics on for-profit institutions - what they are, whom they enroll, what programs they offer and what they charge - are derived from annual reports required from all colleges taking part in the federal student aid programs, which include Pell Grants and Stafford Loans and are known collectively as Title IV aid. Non-participating institutions are not required to report.

Given that many for-profit colleges rely on Title IV aid for 80 percent or more of their revenue, as the following table illustrates, it previously seemed implausible that so many other institutions could survive without it. 
But Professors Cellini and Goldin shatter this perception by compiling administrative data from postsecondary regulatory agencies in five states - Florida, Michigan, Missouri, Tennessee and Wisconsin - that maintain particularly complete records. In each state, non-Title IV colleges represented roughly half or more of all for-profit institutions, and accounted for 12 to 66 percent of student enrollments in the for-profit sector.
While non-Title IV for-profit institutions are younger than their Title IV counterparts, the typical institution has been open for 7 to 11 years. And while non-Title IV for-profits tend to be small, enrolling just 30 to 70 students per offered program, in aggregate the authors estimate that such institutions enroll nearly 670,000 students nationwide each year. This implies that federal estimates of for-profit enrollments, at 1.8 million students, may be understated by about 37 percent.
Since accreditation is a prerequisite for Title IV participation - and a potentially costly one at that - these nonparticipating institutions tend to specialize in unaccredited non-degree programs in such fields as cosmetology, culinary services and health-related services. But there is significant overlap in the types of non-degree programs offered at non-Title IV and Title IV for-profit institutions.
Most strikingly, the authors find that similar non-degree programs cost about 75 percent more when offered at Title IV institutions - with the difference in tuition roughly approximating the size of a Pell Grant. This lends support to the so-called Bennett Hypothesis that federal student aid simply enables institutions to increase prices, at least when those institutions are profit-seeking.
Advocates for the for-profit sector can assert that the tuition premium for non-degree programs at Title IV institutions reflects the burdens of obtaining accreditation, complying with federal regulations and providing higher-quality programs and services (indeed, the president and chief executive of the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities cited precisely these factors in a recent article discussing the new research). 
The study, however, provides two pieces of evidence that quality cannot fully explain the observed tuition differential. First, the authors examine cosmetology programs in Florida, for which they obtained data on state-licensing-exam pass rates. While the Title IV cosmetology programs charged nearly 70 percent more than their non-Title IV counterparts, their students' pass rates were virtually identical. 
Second, the authors examine tuition prices for very short programs, which are ineligible for federal student aid even when they are offered at Title IV institutions. Here, they find no significant differences in tuition. So to accept the "quality" argument, one must believe that Title IV institutions provide better quality only in those programs that are eligible for federal student aid.
An alternative argument is that Title IV for-profit institutions spend more on recruitment and marketing - which account for 31 percent of their overall expenses, according to some estimates - and then pocket the remaining federal subsidy as profit. 
New federal regulations will require for-profit institutions to demonstrate the "gainful employment" of their graduates as an additional condition of Title IV participation. But colleges that lose their Title IV eligibility as a result might not disappear; they might simply join the hidden majority of for-profit institutions that manage to thrive without relying on federal student aid.

HEADLINE: Measuring Housing's Drag on the Economy

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: A new study quantifies the ways in which the dismal housing market has retarded the recovery, in comparison with other recent major recessions. 

 BODY:
Here's a reminder about a problem that still doesn't get the attention that it deserves: Housing has blown a giant smoking hole in the middle of our economy, and the consequences continue to impede the pace of recovery.
A new paper presented Friday at a monetary policy conference in New York puts some interesting new numbers on the scope of the problem.
The pace of recovery since the financial crisis has been less than half as fast as after the last two major recessions, which ended in 1975 and 1982. In first 10 quarters after those recessions, the economy grew by 13.4 percent; in the wake of this recession, the economy grew by only 6.2 percent.
And, the paper says, "more than half the underperformance in this recovery is associated with housing-related sectors."
Yes, that's right. Housing is more than half of our problem.
The details by now are probably familiar: The crash in housing prices erased a vast amount of wealth and, perhaps even more importantly, it severely restricted borrowing power. Many people are unable to refinance and unable to tap the value of their homes to finance consumption or investments.
In other words, the housing crash not only caused the crisis, it is impeding the recovery - it is interfering with the Federal Reserve's easy-money aid campaign, which aims to promote growth by encouraging new borrowing.

"Housing problems have both offset the stimulative impact of easy monetary policy and have impaired the link between policy and the economy," says the paper by Michael E. Feroli, a J.P. Morgan economist, and three collaborators.
The paper offers a striking way of thinking about the depth of this housing problem. It calculates that at the end of 2010, the total value of American homes exceeded demand by about 9 percent, or about $1.5 trillion.
Lower interest rates attract more buyers by reducing the cost of buying a home. But the authors calculate that rates would have needed to drop into negative territory to attract enough buyers. In other words, rather than charging people for money, lenders would have needed to give money to borrowers for free -- and then pay them for agreeing to take it.
How much? Lenders would have needed to pay borrowers an annual interest rate of 0.8 percent, about 5 percentage points lower than the prevailing situation, in which lenders charge borrowers rates of about 4 percent.
That won't happen, of course. Instead, absent new efforts by the government, the most likely outcome is that the housing crash will weigh on the economy for years to come as demand slowly rises to absorb all of that supply. 
The paper, presented at an annual conference hosted by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, says that the consequences are not spread evenly across the country.
Economists would generally expect a stronger rebound in areas where the downturn was sharper, but the authors reached the opposite conclusion.
"The recovery actually is stronger in areas that did not have a severe decline in housing prices," said Amir Sufi, a professor of finance at the university's business school and one of the authors of the paper.
The weakness is concentrated in the states hit hardest by the housing crash, the "sand states" of Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada. These are the states where the Fed's efforts to bolster the economy had the least effect, because so many residents are constrained in their ability to take advantage of lower rates.
I described the impact on the Orlando area last year.
The new paper offers some striking numbers underscoring the problem. 
The issuing of permits for remodeling activity has increased every year since 2000 in states with relatively modest housing bubbles; the housing crash only slowed the pace of growth. By contrast, in the states with the largest bubble, issuing of permits has collapsed.
Auto sales declined everywhere during the recession, but the drop was much larger in the housing bubble states, and the recovery has come more slowly. Sales have returned to roughly 90 percent of the pre-recession level in states where housing prices remained relatively stable, but sales have reached only about 60 percent of the pre-recession level in states where housing prices fell sharply.

HEADLINE: Hating You Was Easy, Losing You Is Hard

BYLINE: CHRISTOPH FUHRMANS


HIGHLIGHT: As Kansas prepares to play Missouri on Saturday in men's basketball for the 267th time, a K.U. alumnus laments the imminent passing of the rivalry. 

 BODY:
Two top five teams will play each other Saturday with a conference championship and a possible No. 1 seed in the N.C.A.A. tournament at stake.
But those aren't even the most important things, because Saturday's game is between Kansas and Missouri, and after 104 years the border war between the Jayhawks and Tigers is ending.
Saturday's game will be the 267th time Kansas and Missouri will have played each other in men's basketball, with the Jayhawks leading the series, 171-95.
Next season Missouri will begin playing in the Southeastern Conference, leaving behind the Big 12 and its bitter rivalry with Kansas.
I, for one, will miss the hate.
After growing up in Kansas and attending K.U., I have thoroughly enjoyed hating Missouri through the years. The Jayhawks have other rivalries in the Big 12, but none match the intensity of K.U.-M.U.
Sure, Kansas State holds a special place in Jayhawks' hearts because it is a fellow in-state school, but that rivalry is more like one between siblings. And as far as basketball is concerned, it really hasn't been much of a rivalry through the years - Kansas has a 184-91 record against the Wildcats.
Texas has been a worthy opponent since the inception of the Big 12, but there isn't enough history between the Longhorns and the Jayhawks to build a solid rivalry.
With the Tigers, history is what sets the rivalry apart. Kansas-Missouri is the oldest rivalry west of the Mississippi and began during the Civil War. Every child growing up in Kansas learns about William Quantrill's raid that burned down Lawrence and set the tone for the violent encounters between the two states.
Figures in both Kansas and Missouri continued to add to that history each time the schools played.
The former Missouri coach Norm Stewart always made sure the team bus filled up on gas in Missouri before leaving for games in Lawrence. He refused to help support the Kansas economy at the expense of Missouri's. Stewart was one of the coaches Jayhawks fans loved to hate, always chanting, "Sit down, Norm," whenever the Tigers played in Allen Fieldhouse.
Don Fambrough, the former Kansas football coach who died last year, was famous for delivering fiery pregame speeches during Kansas-Missouri games. He even helped write a children's book about how much he hated the Tigers.
That hatred will be on full display Saturday in Allen Fieldhouse, where Jayhawks fans will serenade the Tigers with the famous Rock Chalk chant. Kansas will try to avenge its 74-71 loss to Missouri on Feb. 4 in Columbia, Mo. In that game, Kansas had a 71-63 lead with 3 minutes 20 seconds left before Marcus Denmon scored 9 of Missouri's last 11 points to rally the Tigers to victory.
If Kansas wins Saturday's game, it will wrap up at least a share of the Big 12 conference title, which would be the Jayhawks' eighth in a row.
If Missouri wins, it will tie Kansas atop the conference standings, with each team having two games remaining in the regular season.
Much has been said and written about the end of the rivalry between Kansas and Missouri. Many people want the rivalry to continue, like Sports Illustrated's Seth Davis, but Kansas Coach Bill Self is not one of them. In a recent interview with The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Self spelled out the reasons Kansas would not be playing Missouri any time soon.
If Saturday's game is the last time the two schools play each other, it will be a fitting tribute to the end of one of the best rivalries in all of college sports.
Personally, I'm hoping for a rematch in the Big 12 Conference tournament.

HEADLINE: A.I.G. Buys $2 Billion in Maiden Lane Bonds

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: The insurance giant bought the bonds from an investment vehicle created to absorb troubled assets from A.I.G. as part of am enormous taxpayer-financed bailout. 

 BODY:
A collection of mortgage-backed bonds bought from the American International Group at the height of the financial crisis has a new owner: A.I.G.
A.I.G., the insurance giant, revealed on Friday that it had bought just under $2 billion in bonds originally held in an investment vehicle financed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That vehicle, Maiden Lane II, was created in 2008 to absorb troubled assets from A.I.G. as part of an enormous taxpayer-financed bailout.
Last March, the insurer made a $15.7 billion bid for the entire Maiden Lane II portfolio, sensing that the market for the assets had recovered since the crisis. The New York Fed rejected that bid, saying the public interest would be better served by auctioning the securities to third parties.
 At the time, Robert H. Benmosche, A.I.G.'s chief executive, told DealBook that the spurned bid was a "huge problem" for the company.
But Mr. Benmosche found a way to solve the problem, buying Maiden Lane II securities from third parties once they had been sold off. Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs won auctions for $7 billion and $6.2 billion of the securities, respectively, this year, and quickly sold many of the bonds to clients, including A.I.G.
In a conference call with analysts to announce A.I.G.'s fourth-quarter earnings, Mr. Benmosche said that the company had been asked "a lot of questions about how much of Maiden Lane II" it had been able to buy from the auction winners.
"I might as well just answer it so you don't keep asking it," he said. "While we've added a lot of mortgage-backed securities to our asset class that we have for the general account and so on, we've only purchased just under $2 billion of the assets coming out of Maiden Lane II."
Mr. Benmosche added, with pangs of regret, that the insurer would have "felt more comfortable" buying the entire portfolio in March.
"But if we didn't get the whole thing, we were very careful about what we bought," he said.
Along with the price gains if the bonds appreciate in value, A.I.G. can make profits from the sale of any additional Maiden Lane II assets. Under the terms of the Maiden Lane II vehicle, once the insurer's principal and interest are repaid, any additional money the New York Fed makes from the sale of Maiden Lane II assets will be split between the Fed and A.I.G. - five-sixths to the Fed and one-sixth to A.I.G.

HEADLINE: El Paso Corp. Sells Units to Apollo-Led Group for $7.15 Billion

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The El Paso Corporation has agreed to sell its exploration and production businesses to a consortium led by Apollo Global Management for about $7.15 billion, in one of the biggest leveraged buyouts since the end of the financial crisis. 

 BODY:
8:31 p.m. | Updated 
The El Paso Corporation agreed on Friday to sell its exploration and production businesses to a consortium led by Apollo Global Management for about $7.15 billion, striking one of the biggest leveraged buyouts since the end of the financial crisis.
In buying the units, Apollo and its partners - a group that includes Riverstone Holdings, the Russian-born industrialist Len Blavatnik and several unidentified investors - are the latest to find attractive takeover targets in North America's oil and natural gas patch.
"Apollo is acquiring a company with an impressive portfolio of valuable natural resource assets," Josh Harris, senior managing director at Apollo, said in a statement.
The deal also provides a respite from a sharp slowdown in mergers activity for the year to date. Announced worldwide deal volume has plunged 35 percent from the previous year, according to Thomson Reuters.
At the heart of the latest round of deals is a boom in drilling for natural gas and related compounds through techniques like hydraulic fracturing. Late last year, a group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts struck a $7.2 billion takeover of the Samson Investment Company, one of the country's biggest privately held energy companies.
Many of these transactions have led to a rafter of new oil and gas billionaires, whose companies were snatched up after infusions of capital from private equity backers.
Friday's deal was made possible through Kinder Morgan's $21.1 billion takeover of El Paso itself, which will create the biggest network of oil and gas pipelines on the continent. To help pay for that transaction, Kinder Morgan said it would sell off El Paso's exploration and production units.
Despite the attractiveness of those divisions, which include parts of shale formations in Texas and Colorado, analysts and investors had regarded the units as nonessential for some time. El Paso announced last spring that it was exploring spinning them off to shareholders to focus on its pipeline operations.
Those holdings had been the subject of controversy in 2003, after El Paso admitted to having overstated its proven natural gas reserves.
Last spring's announcement spurred interest from potential buyers, according to a person briefed on the matter. But it took the Kinder Morgan deal and a formal auction of the businesses to prompt formal interest from Apollo and other suitors.
Apollo and its partners were regarded as formidable candidates relatively early on in the process, in part because they sought to buy the El Paso businesses in one transaction, making for a cleaner sale, according to people briefed on the matter.
Within the corps of advisers to the Apollo consortium, the deal was known internally as "Project Everest," according to a person briefed on the matter. 
Apollo has struck a number of energy deals in recent years, including selling Parallel Petroleum to a unit of Samsung in December for nearly $800 million after buying the company in 2009 for about $483 million. And Riverstone is a well-known investor in energy companies, having participated in at least 24 deals last year, according to data from Capital IQ.
The Apollo-led group is expected to put up about $3 billion in capital to back the deal, a relatively high amount of equity for a leveraged buyout but fairly standard for an energy deal. The consortium will also draw upon about $5.5 billion in financing arranged by seven banks, led by Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase.
One possible hitch for Friday's deal is a lawsuit filed in Delaware by El Paso shareholders arguing that the company's sale to Kinder Morgan is flawed and should be reopened to other potential buyers. The Apollo-led leveraged buyout is contingent on the closing of the earlier deal, according to one of the people briefed on the matter.
El Paso was advised by Evercore Partners and Barclays Capital.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Defends Its Efforts to Fight Financial Fraud

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: This talk of a crackdown on white-collar crime comes after the Securities and Exchange Commission was assailed for failing to rein in Wall Street ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. 

 BODY:
Corporate crooks beware.
A panel of Securities and Exchange Commission regulators gathered in Washington on Friday to trumpet their recent crackdown on financial fraud and Wall Street wrongdoing. The regulators, in particular a group of high-ranking enforcement officials, highlighted efforts to root out everything from insider trading at hedge funds to troubled mortgage securities sold by big banks. 
"The S.E.C. is now materially better able to enforce the law and identify and manage threats," Mary L. Schapiro, the agency's chairwoman, said at the conference on Friday titled "S.E.C. Speaks."
This talk of a crackdown comes after the S.E.C. was assailed for failing to rein in Wall Street ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. Even now, critics question why the agency has not sued a top executive at any of the nation's biggest banks.
But the S.E.C,, emboldened after shuffling its enforcement staff and gaining new powers through the Dodd-Frank regulatory law, did file 735 enforcement actions last fiscal year. The cases produced $2.8 billion in penalties and fees.
Robert S. Khuzami, chief of the enforcement division, lauded what he called the "record performance" on Friday. The revamped enforcement division, Mr. Khuzami said, is "trying to identify misconduct early rather than chasing the headline."
The S.E.C. on Friday played up the prominent cases filed in the aftermath of the crisis -- including actions against Wall street titans like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase. Nearly 100 people and companies have been ensnared in the agency's crisis-related cases.
Still, the enforcement team has hit some recent road bumps. 
The S.E.C. has repeatedly clashed with Judge Jed S. Rakoff in Federal District Court in Manhattan, who has challenged some of the agency's biggest cases. Judge Rakoff has taken aim at the S.E.C.'s long standing "neither admit nor deny" policy, which allows companies to settle enforcement cases without acknowledging wrongdoing. 
Judge Rakoff, perhaps most notably, is now holding up the Citigroup case, which centers on whether the bank duped investors into buying mortgage bonds. Citigroup has agreed to settle the case.
The S.E.C.'s top litigator, however, defended the settlement policy and painted Judge Rakoff's efforts as rogue.
"There's only been one judge who's rejected any of our settlements," Matthew T. Martens, the chief litigation counsel, said on Friday, smiling as he declined to identify Judge Rakoff by name.
Mr. Martens rebuffed criticism that the S.E.C.'s settlement policy was too soft on Wall Street. The policy, he said, reflects concerns that the agency could lose at trial or rack up hefty expenses during a protracted legal battle. 
He also noted that the agency did not settle with about three-quarters of people sued in crisis cases. 
"The reality is we've had tremendous success," he said, "and we're not shying away from bringing cases."

HEADLINE: Do Kingfisher's Woes Call For New Bankruptcy Rules?

BYLINE: VIKAS BAJAJ and HEATHER TIMMONS


HIGHLIGHT: In India, it sometimes seems flailing companies never die. 

 BODY:
What should happen to a money-losing, heavily indebted company like Kingfisher Airlines?
If the company was operating in the United States, the answer would be short and simple: it would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
A fast-moving bankruptcy court would allow the company's management and creditors to hash out a plan to restructure debt, labor contracts and airplane leases, while it continues to fly planes with minimal disruption. Most major American airlines, including United, Delta and U.S. Airways, have done exactly that; American Airlines is in bankruptcy court now.
But in India, Kingfisher doesn't have that option.
If the company does not find a strategic partner with a significant hunk of cash, fast, it might be forced to undergo a "wind-up" that essentially entails the liquidation of corporate assets to pay off its liabilities, which would put it out of business. Kingfisher has already tried the other main option -- corporate debt restructuring, a Reserve Bank of India process where banks collectively restructure the debts of a troubled company often exchange some of their debt into equity.
In India, it sometimes seems as if flailing companies never die. Our colleague Sam Dolnick wrote about the drawn-out end of Campa Cola, the Indian soft drink, in this memorable story about an old accountant that was still working at the company almost a decade after the plant and offices had shut down.
A growing number of corporate advisors say that India would benefit from creating an American-style bankruptcy system.
India Ink's Vikas Bajaj and Heather Timmons, who have covered banking and corporate finance in the United States and India, found themselves on opposite sides of the fence when they discussed the issue.
Below are their arguments for and against India adopting an American-style bankruptcy system. What do you think?
Vikas Bajaj outlines arguments for why India should consider a U.S.-style bankruptcy system:
The American bankruptcy system is far from perfect but it seems to do a better job handling corporate failure than other approaches.
If you are a lender or a bondholder, consider the following: India's equivalent of bankruptcy recovers just 12 percent of debts, compared to 36 percent in China, according to the report (PDF) of a government-appointed committee chaired by the economist Raghhuram Rajan. In the United States, by contrast, bondholders recovered nearly 45 percent of the par value of their bonds in corporate bankruptcies between 1983 and 2002, according to one research paper.
Some critics argue that the American system might recover the most money but also allows managers and owners to use bankruptcy courts to fire thousands of employees after running the firms into the ground. Certainly, there is a fairly long history of such chicanery. But the same often happens in countries like India, where employees often do not have the legal means to enforce their rights against owners and managers who have looted their companies.
In an American bankruptcy court, lenders, employees and the government can get the court to replace poorly performing or fraudulent managers and appoint an independent trustee who works on their behalf, rather than the people who ran the company into the ground. Moreover, the restructuring process often wipes out the equity of previous owners who mismanaged them.
Another larger argument in favor of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is that it encourages risk-taking and has made the American economy vibrant and inventive. Entrepreneurs, including many from India, thrive in the States because they know that if they fail they can file for bankruptcy, take a hit but then start over. For the economy as a whole, it is important the legal system provide a path to deal with corporate mistakes and failures as effectively and quickly as possible.
"India would benefit greatly from a better bankruptcy code, one that reflects a good balance between trying to keep the firm alive as a going concern versus the easy task of carving up assets and selling them off," Ajay Shah, a professor with the National Institute for Public Finance and Policy in New Delhi, wrote in an e-mail.
A U.S. style bankruptcy system won't fix Kingfisher's problems, Heather Timmons argues, and would be unpalatable in India. 
Airlines in the United States certainly have embraced bankruptcy in recent years, but the industry that has been created is no more stable than the one that existed before the mass Chapter 11 filings.
With the bankruptcy of American Airlines, "every major full-service airline in the United states will have gone through Chapter 11 at least once," Seton Hall School of Law's corporate governance chairman Stephen J. Lubben wrote in The New York Times's Dealbook blog last November. The newly emerged airlines all have "the same basic low-cost structure and revamped asset package," and are all offering the same service to the bulk of their customers. Consequently, their odds of long-term survival are low, he concludes:
"Just as the nation learned in the 1970s that there really was no need for multiple railroads to offer the same basic passenger service to the same basic points across the country, I suspect we are headed for a similar day of reckoning in domestic air travel.
And then, more Chapter 11 cases."
American-style bankruptcy court has a well-ordered hierarchy for doling out a company's remaining paltry assets that some find rewards the very people who encouraged it to over-reach.
Generally, the first to be repaid are secured creditors like bank lenders, or equipment owners, then corporate bond holders, along with other unsecured creditors. (Along the way bankruptcy lawyers and advisers take a very healthy cut - to the tune of more than $1 billion at Lehman Brothers, for example). At the very bottom of the pile are equity holders. While there are some safeguards for employees pensions and retirement benefits, they often wind up hacked to pieces.
When American Airlines declared bankruptcy in November, a curious thing happened - Gerard J. Arpey, the company's chief executive and an employee for thirty years, stepped down, because according to some interpretations, he was disgusted by the entire process.
D. Michael Lindsay, the president of Gordon College, who is working on a book on corporate governance, writes in a recent op-ed in The New York Times:
"For a long time, Mr. Arpey voiced his opposition to bankruptcy, but the airline struggled because of it. 'Our bankrupt colleagues all made net profits, good net profits last year, and we didn't,' Mr. Arpey told me a few months ago. 'And you can mathematically pinpoint that to termination of pensions, termination of retiree medical benefits, changes of work rules, changes in the labor contracts.'"
That type of system, where bankers get rewarded and employees punished when a company fails, would be impossible to introduce in India with its long history of labor unrest and strong government support for employees.

HEADLINE: The Big Breakup

BYLINE: HEATHER TIMMONS


HIGHLIGHT: Citigroup, American Airlines, Telenor and others have cut ties in India in recent weeks. 

 BODY:
A host of foreign companies have split, sometimes very acrimoniously, from Indian partners and operations in recent weeks. The breakups have happened for a myriad of reasons, but the overall trend does not bode well for the Indian government'srecent push for more foreign investment.
Jan. 9: American Airlines said it would stop flying its Chicago-New Delhi flight as of March 1 and close its Delhi operations, citing the "historical financial performance of the route and its future outlook given the global economic climate and high oil prices."
 Feb. 3: The Oneworld alliance, a partnership of more than 140 airlines, said Kingfisher Airlines' entry, planned for years, had been suspended. "We have been working closely with Kingfisher Airlines over the past months and it has become increasingly clear recently that the airline needs more time to resolve the financial issues it is confronting before it can be welcomed into Oneworld," said its chief executive, Bruce Ashby.
Feb. 15: Telenor Group of Norway said it would sever ties with its Indian strategic partner Unitech after India's Supreme Court revoked 122 telecom operators' licenses, following an investigation into how licenses were issued. "The legality and validity of the licenses was a fundamental term of the share subscription agreement between Telenor Group and Unitech Limited," said Pal Wien Espen, Telnor's general counsel, adding that the Supreme Court's move "conclusively demonstrates a clear breach of Unitech's warranties."
Feb. 22: The United Arab Emirates mobile phone operator Etisalat says it will shut its Indian operations and split from its local partner, DB Group, decisions that were also related to the Supreme Court's license ruling. Etisalat will reconsider entering India when there is a clearer "telecommunications policy and greater legal and regulatory certainty and stability," the company said. The company is filing a lawsuitagainst DB Group, alleging fraud and misrepresentation, charges DB Group denies. 
Feb. 23: Citigroup plans to sell its stakein the Indian mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp., or HDFC, company executives tell reporters, winding down what was once a stake of more than 11 percent.

HEADLINE: Live Nation Narrows Loss on Higher Revenue

BYLINE: BEN SISARIO


HIGHLIGHT: Live Nation had $5.4 billion in revenue in 2011, up 6.3 percent from the year before, led by improved performance in its ticketing unit and growth in e-commerce, the company reported on Thursday. 

 BODY:
Live Nation Entertainment, the concert giant that includes Ticketmaster, had improved revenue in 2011 and narrowed its loss, as the company and the larger touring industry work to regain momentum lost in the recession.
Live Nation, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., had $5.4 billion in revenue in 2011, up 6.3 percent from the year before, led by improved performance in its ticketing unit and growth in e-commerce, the company reported on Thursday.
Adjusted operating income, which the company defines as operating income before depreciation, noncash compensation and other expenses, was $438 million, up 20.7 percent over 2010, when it had $363 million. Its net loss was $83 million, a nearly 64 percent improvement over its $228 million loss in 2010.
In its fourth quarter, Live Nation had $1.2 billion in revenue, down 4.2 percent from the same period the year before, and adjusted operating income of $51 million, down 10.7 percent from the same period in 2010.

The concert industry, which nearly tripled in value from 1999 to 2009, was badly shaken in 2010. The overall market fell about 15 percent that year, the industry's first loss in 15 years. The recession has been blamed as the primary factor in that loss, but critics of the industry and of Live Nation in particular, have also pointed to rapidly escalating ticket prices as a factor that alienated many fans.
Live Nation and other live entertainment companies have since made various changes to their pricing schemes; last year, Live Nation sold 1.1 million tickets at a discount through Groupon. But despite that and other programs intended to price tickets more efficiently -- like dynamic pricing, which allows for fluctuating prices based on demand -- the cost of an average ticket to one of the top 100 tours in North America last year climbed 8.9 percent to $67.22, only slightly less than the industry's historic peak of $67.33 in 2008.
Last year, Live Nation sold 141 million tickets, compared to 120 million in 2010.
In an interview, Michael Rapino, Live Nation's president and chief executive, said that the larger concert industry was poised to rebound in 2012, and that the losses in 2010 were "a blip in the long-term trajectory of the industry." He pointed to "smarter" pricing efforts and the growth of electronic music as positive signs for the year.
For the year through Feb. 19, Live Nation's concert sales were up 22 percent compared to the same period in 2011, the company said, with concert sales in North America up 28 percent and tickets for European festivals up 14 percent.
Mr. Rapino said he expected single-digit percentage growth in 2012 for Live Nation's concert division, and flat to low single-digit growth in ticket sales. (Ticketmaster sells tickets for many promoters' events, not just the shows Live Nation puts on.) But he was especially bullish on the secondary ticket markets, where fans and brokers resell their tickets. He expected double-digit growth in these secondary exchanges, particularly through its deals with the National Football League, where it operates a secondary ticket exchange system.
In 2009, the year before Live Nation and Ticketmaster merged, TicketsNow, a secondary ticketing marketplace owned by Ticketmaster, became the focus of national attention when Bruce Springsteen fans looking for tickets directly from the box office were instead pointed to expensive scalped offerings on TicketsNow.
Ticketmaster settled with the State of New Jersey over the affair, but it has since reinstated a system of linking primary and secondary sales that it says are appropriate.

HEADLINE: Another Yogurt Factory Planned for Upstate

BYLINE: THOMAS KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: PepsiCo and a German dairy company, Theo Muller, will invest $206 million in a new plant to be constructed in Batavia, N.Y., midway between Buffalo and Rochester, according to the governor's office. 

 BODY:
5 p.m. | Updated A fast-growing industry in upstate New York - yogurt production - is about to get even bigger.
Gov.Andrew M. Cuomo said Friday that PepsiCo and a German dairy company had agreed to open a yogurt factory in the western part of the state, adding 186 jobs to an industry that has provided a needed jolt for New York's dairy farms and several struggling communities.
PepsiCo and the German company, Theo Mller, will invest $206 million in the new plant, to be constructed over two years in Batavia, N.Y., midway between Buffalo and Rochester, according to the governor's office. The state and Genesee County have agreed to provide about $26 million in tax credits and other incentives to help attract the companies.
Mr. Cuomo heralded the deal as the latest in a string of victories for the state's dairy industry.
"This project demonstrates that leading international companies like PepsiCo and Mller see New York as a premier place to invest and the natural choice for their first venture into the yogurt business," he said in a statement.
The new plant will bolster a booming business in an area of the state that is more used to collapsing industries than burgeoning ones.
A PepsiCo spokesman, Jeff Dahncke, said that the new plant would produce "a range of great new yogurt products," but that the companies were still working out the specific brands and types of yogurt that they would sell.
"There is tremendous opportunity for new products to enter the U.S. dairy market," Mr. Dahncke said. "We also greatly appreciate the support from the local and state officials from New York who helped make this project possible."
New York already is home to 29 yogurt plants, which altogether employ more than 2,000 people, according to the governor's office. The plants produced 530 million pounds of yogurt last year, a 43 percent increase over the year before.
Mr. Cuomo, eager to address high unemployment and to prompt economic development, has shown considerable enthusiasm for the yogurt industry. In December, after spotting a news story on an Albany-area television station, he brokered a peace agreement between two warring communities to allow another yogurt maker, Fage USA, to proceed with a planned expansion of its Greek-style yogurt plant in the Mohawk Valley.
And Chobani, another popular Greek-style yogurt, is based in Chenango County.
Last month, when Mr. Cuomo announced a wager with Massachusetts' governor over the Super Bowl, Mr. Cuomo offered not only traditional New York products - bagels and cheesecakes - but also 46 cases of Greek-style yogurt, which his office described as "one of the state's newest and hottest exports." (Mr. Cuomo won the bet when the Giants won, but the manufacturers nonetheless donated the wagered products to food banks in the two states.)

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
Sears Risks Giving Up Profitable Stores in Gamble for Cash | Sears Holdings moved on Thursday to allay fears that it could run low on cash this year, announcing plans to sell stores in transactions that the company says could raise nearly $800 million.
But the deals also highlight the major challenges that Sears faces as it tries to stop a multiyear slump in its operations, analysts said.
Sears may be giving up its most profitable stores in exchange for a quick cash infusion today. In one of the transactions, Sears also expects current shareholders to foot the bill, potentially leaving them more exposed to the troubled retailer.
"As a matter of fact, spinoffs like these could leave Sears with a very unprofitable core Sears U.S. business," said Mary Ross Gilbert, an analyst with Imperial Capital, a brokerage firm.
These moves come as the company's largest investor, its chairman, Edward S. Lampert, has been increasing his personal stake in the company. Mr. Lampert engineered the merger of Kmart and Sears, Roebuck, in a $11 billion deal in late 2004, and his hedge funds now own 61 percent of the stock.

HIGHLIGHT: Pakistani expats just got the right to vote in elections back home: keep them connected and those remittances will come. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Walk through Brixton Market in south London, and one sound trumps all others: the emphatic din of Pakistani butchers arguing about politicians back home. Earlier this week, my attempt to buy lamb chops at A.M. Halal Butchers turned into an extended discussion about who was more corrupt (President Asif Ali Zardari or General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the army chief?), who was better suited to stabilize the economy (the opposition leader Nawaz Sharif or the cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan?), and whose son might be a visionary (suffice it to say, Bilawal Bhutto, the Oxford-educated son of Zardari and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, is not popular with Brixton butchers).
This is not the first time that an innocent attempt at commerce has devolved into a fiery debate about Pakistani politics. During my years living abroad, in the United States and Britain, I have encountered more impassioned viewpoints about Pakistan's politics and policies than in provincial assemblies, university halls, political party offices and drawing rooms across Pakistan.

Howling about Pakistani politics is the ultimate form of catharsis for expatriates: it's at once a means to stay connected to the country, express concern about loved ones back home, manage the guilt of having left it all behind and feel relief about having got out before things became even worse. You can take the Pakistanis out of Pakistan, but you can't take Pakistan's politics out of Pakistanis.
No wonder, then, that the diaspora found much cause for celebration in last week's announcement by the Election Commission of Pakistan (E.C.P.) that 3.7 million Pakistani expatriates will be allowed to vote in the next general elections, scheduled for spring 2013.
A leading Pakistani-American has hailed the decision as an opportunity to strengthen the "solidarity and integrity of our motherland." Suniya Qureshi, the executive director of the British Pakistan Foundation, a charity that aims to mobilize the diaspora in Britain, told me on Tuesday that the decision is the "right way for the Pakistan government to chart out a relationship with the overseas community and create ownership among the diaspora."
But back in Pakistan, the E.C.P.'s announcement has sparked the latest round of political mudslinging. The idea of granting Pakistani expats voting rights only gained traction when the political upstart Khan petitioned for it in the Supreme Court. His political opponents claim that Khan stands to gain most from the change since his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (P.T.I.) party enjoys widespread support in the diaspora. Some analysts and pro-government activists also say it undermines President Zardari's ruling Pakistan Peoples Party, which has recently clashed with the court over corruption cases against the president, leading to contempt-of-court charges against the prime minister.
It is unlikely that any nefarious politics motivated the ECP's announcement. For once, the matter boils down to simple economics. Remittances from expatriate Pakistanis are the backbone of Pakistan's economy. The inflows ease the country's current account deficit and boost its foreign exchange reserves. In 2010, remittances accounted for more than 5 percent of the country's G.D.P. Between July and December last year, overseas Pakistanis sent back $6.3 billion, almost 20 percent more over the same period the year before. The World Bank ranks Pakistan among the top ten recipients of remittances.
Engaging the diaspora by allowing expats to vote is a way of keeping the money flowing. As Qureshi puts it, "British-Pakistanis are hugely passionate about the country, and there's a growing appetite to influence things and improve governance."
In the long run, though, these new voting rights may also prove to be a test of allegiance. The E.C.P. has ruled that Pakistanis holding dual citizenship are not eligible to vote. Will Pakistani expats put off applying for a second nationality in order to retain their right to vote back home?
My butcher, who became British in the late 1990s, says he wouldn't trade his red passport for a ballot: "It's easier to complain about the politicians back home than try to do something about their shenanigans."

HEADLINE: Who Might Run as a Third-Party Candidate in 2012?

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The chatter about a possible third-party challenge in the fall has never been more active. But who might make a run? 

 BODY:
Is the presidential choice in the fall going to be between President Obama, a Republican and someone else?
The Republican presidential campaign is nowhere near over yet. And Mr. Obama's campaign is just beginning to gear up. But the chatter about a possible third-party challenge in the fall has never been more active.
Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah whose bid for the Republican nomination fizzled, is the latest to raise the possibility.
Appearing on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program on Thursday, Mr. Huntsman - who has endorsed Mitt Romney for president - said that the political system was "broken" and that a third party may be the only way to fix it.
"I think we're going to have problems politically until we get some sort of third-party movement or some voice out there that can put forth new ideas," Mr. Huntsman said. "Someone's going to step up at some point and say, 'We've had enough of this.' The real issues are not being addressed, and it's time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate."
Mr. Huntsman said a third candidate in the presidential race would be a "healthy thing" - not part of the script that Mr. Romney's campaign would have approved. But Mr. Huntsman said that he was not anyone's surrogate despite his endorsement.
And yet, it took just moments for Mr. Huntsman to reject the idea that he might be a candidate for president on behalf of a third party.
"That ain't gonna be me, by the way," Mr. Huntsman said. "I'm not interested in that."
Recent third parties have largely been personality-driven efforts - John B. Anderson in 1980, Ross Perot in 1992, Ralph Nader in 2000, 2004 and 2008. The challenge, of course, is to move beyond talk.
Ballot access rules make it very difficult for third-party candidates to get their names listed in all 50 states. The party structures in local communities often works to discourage organizing on behalf of third-party candidates. And money is a huge problem -- donors typically shun candidates who are not perceived to have a good chance of winning.
A group called Americans Elect is set to nominate its own candidate through an online primary later this year. The Green Party and others are already organized to offer a challenge to the Democrats and the Republicans. The Libertarians will field a presidential candidate in the fall.
But who?
Here's a list of some of the people who have said they might run outside one of the two major parties or have been talked about as potential third-party candidates this year - and some of the challenges they would face.
BUDDY ROEMER: The former governor of Louisiana is the latest to say he plans to run for president in the fall without the backing of one of the two big political parties. Mr. Roemer had been a Republican candidate, but had been excluded from the debates and he finally got fed up.
"They have once again turned their backs on the democratic process by choosing to exclude a former governor and congressman," Mr. Roemer said of the party and the television networks.
Mr. Roemer - a Democrat-turned-Republican - has real political credentials. But he has been out of office for more than a decade, and his platform is almost entirely about a critique of the big-money interests. He says he will seek the nomination of Americans Elect.
RON PAUL: The Texas congressman has said repeatedly that he's unlikely to run as a third-party candidate if he's unsuccessful in capturing the Republican nomination. But he always leaves himself a little wiggle room - enough to make sure that the talk about the possibility never completely goes away.
He has proven himself to be a prolific fund-raiser and clearly has a base of support, especially among young people, who are very committed to his message, and in an odd way, to him personally. Mr. Paul believes strongly in his message of liberty, fiscal austerity and isolationism. A third-party run would allow him to continue talking about it.
But he also has to consider his son, Rand Paul, who is a Republican senator from Kentucky and may have ambitions to run for president himself someday. If Mr. Paul were to run as an independent and possibly tip the election to Democrats, his son's future in politics might be tougher.
DONALD TRUMP: The reality-TV star and real estate mogul has flirted with a presidential race - and with the media - for months, first as a Republican. He has now endorsed Mr. Romney but says he is considering a third-party bid if Mr. Romney does not get the Republican nomination. 
Mr. Trump would face plenty of questions about whether a third-party run is just a publicity stunt or an act of personal pique. And it's not clear that he has - or could raise - the kind of money he would need to be seriously competitive against the other two parties.
Most of all, it's hard to imagine that a Trump candidacy would be anything more than a vehicle for media attention - less a third-party candidacy than a promotion of the Trump brand.
MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG: The billionaire mayor of New York has repeatedly said that he is not really interested in running for president as a third-party candidate. But that hasn't kept his top aides and boosters from stoking the fires every now and then.
Several years ago, Mr. Bloomberg, who left the Republican Party to officially become an independent, hinted that if he did run, he might spend as much as $1 billion of his own money. But he also has repeatedly said that the structural impediments to a third-party candidate are simply too great to overcome.
Still, there are plenty of people urging Mr. Bloomberg to seek the Americans Elect nomination and try to bring his brand of no-nonsense business skills to the White House.
JILL STEIN: Ms. Stein is one of the people running for the presidential nomination from the Green Party. A former doctor, she has run for office before -- in fact, her campaign in Massachusetts was running for governor against Mr. Romney.
But this time, Ms. Stein is trying to tap into the passions of the Occupy Wall Street movement, which she says reflects the anger and frustration of millions of people at the corporate structure and the two parties that enable it.
Money would clearly be a problem for Ms. Stein or anyone who gets the Green Party backing. That's because they would start out with little name recognition, but also because Ms. Stein (and presumably her rivals) reject the kind of wooing of moneyed interests that donate to the other parties.
DAVID WALKER: Perhaps the least known of the bunch, Mr. Walker served as the comptroller general of the United States for a decade, from 1998 to 2008, and was the subject of a column by The New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman earlier this month. Mr. Friedman argued that he would make a good independent candidate.
"After months of nutty, gravity-free Republican primary debates, how great would it be to have presidential debates in which a smart independent like Walker was in the middle to challenge both sides and offer sensible solutions?" Mr. Friedman wrote.
Mr. Walker hinted at the possibility that he might run in a statement that he put out - conveniently on the anniversary of the announcement by Mr. Perot of his own candidacy.
"No one can deny that Ross Perot had a major impact in 1992, even though he did not receive a single electoral vote," Mr. Walker wrote. "His focus on fiscal responsibility made the presidential debates more substantive, and resulted in President Clinton making fiscal responsibility a top priority for his administration."

HEADLINE: Senior Senators Meet With Raoul Castro

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Senators Richard Shelby and Patrick J. Leahy met with the Cuban leader on Thursday to request the release of Alan Gross, an American aid worker held in a military prison on charges of crimes against the state. 

 BODY:
Senior senators met on Thursday with President Raul Castro of Cuba and imprisoned American Alan Gross in Havana in efforts to free the aid worker, but they reported no immediate breakthrough.
Senators Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama, met with Mr. Castro for two and a half hours late Thursday night, in what was the first high-level meeting between the two countries in nearly two years. The senators offered to take Mr. Gross home with them, Mr. Leahy told an Associated Press reporter in Havana.
"You can imagine how far that went," Mr. Leahy told The A.P., adding, "we have a long way to go."
Mr. Leahy met with Mr. Gross at a military prison in Havana, the Cuban capital, on Thursday afternoon. 
The two senators are part of a six-lawmaker trip to Cuba, Haiti and Colombia, which is aimed at widening agricultural trade with Cuba, inspecting recovery efforts from the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and discussing anti-drug efforts in South America. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware and Kent Conrad of North Dakota, and Representatives Xavier Becerra of California and Peter Welch of Vermont, all Democrats, made up the group.
Aides in Washington say they will not hear from the delegation until it lands in Haiti Friday afternoon. But Mr. Leahy spoke extensively to The Associated Press in Havana. He said Mr. Gross, who was imprisoned two years ago for bringing satellite and other communications equipment onto the island, was in good spirits but is concerned about the toll his imprisonment is taking on his health.
Mr. Leahy said Mr. Castro raised the case of five Cuban agents serving long jail sentences in the United States. Mr. Leahy said the Cuban leader did not explicitly raise the possibility of a prisoner swap, but "he made it very clear that while we may be concerned for Mr. Gross and have humanitarian reasons to be, they are very concerned about the five and have humanitarian and family reasons, too."
Mr. Gross, a Maryland resident, was sentenced to 15 years while serving on a democracy-building project funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. He was convicted of crimes against the state, not espionage. Mr. Leahy told The A.P. that Mr. Castro agreed Mr. Gross "was no spy." He spoke little Spanish at the time of his arrest and traveled to Cuba five times in 2009 under his own name before his arrest.

HEADLINE: At a Romney Speech, 1,200 People and 65,000 Seats

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: An economic speech at Ford Field in Detroit doesn't quite give the images Mitt Romney's campaign had imagined. 

 BODY:
Presidential politics is all about the image that you see on television. And by that measure, Mitt Romney's speech from Ford Field in Detroit did not look that bad. 
Mr. Romney could be seen standing at a lectern in front of a backdrop that had the logo of the Detroit Economic Club. And when the audience -- about 1,200 people -- clapped, they filled the TV screen as cameras panned across them.
But in the age of Twitter and the Internet, that is not all that matters.

Even before the speech started, reporters began tweeting out pictures of the 65,000-seat stadium -- completely empty, except for the chairs set up on the field itself, near the 20-yard line.
Row after row of empty blue seats in the huge stadium made the crowd seem minuscule, especially compared with the images of stadiums filled with screaming fans that TV viewers are used to.
And the comparisons do not stop there.
Reporters quickly started posting pictures of the stadium speeches President Obama gave at similar point in his primary campaign four years ago. One, at a stadium in Hartford, was almost filled to capacity -- about 16,000 seats.
Mr. Obama rallied with 14,000 in Boise, Idaho, 18,000 in Minneapolis and more than 20,000 in St. Louis in February 2008.
It is true that Mr. Romney's campaign did not treat this speech as a rally, making no attempt to fill the stadium. This was an economic speech that was moved to Ford Field after the number of people who wanted to attend grew larger than the earlier location could allow.
But in politics, it is always better to show an overly crowded venue than an overly empty one. So the decision to move the event to Ford Field was an unfortunate one for Mr. Romney.
But it is not the first time that a politician ended up with bad images in a stadium.
Four years ago, Senator John McCain decided to give remarks at the Navy and Marine Corps Memorial Stadium, which has a capacity of
35,000. Mr. McCain, who attended the Naval Academy as a young man, wanted to make a point about his credentials and history.
Unfortunately for Mr. McCain, the event was a small one: McCain's campaign had set up 64 chairs in a small corner of the stadium.

HEADLINE: Romney Cadillac Comment Highlights His Wealth

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney stumbled into the same perilous terrain on Friday when, unprompted, he explained that he owns two cars and his wife owns "a couple of Cadillacs." 

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Mitt Romney, whose rhetorical improvisations on the campaign trail have repeatedly reminded voters of his extraordinary wealth, stumbled into the same perilous terrain here on Friday when, unprompted, he explained that he owns two cars and his wife owns "a couple of Cadillacs."
Two Cadillac SRX's, to be exact. The cost of a new model: $35,000 to $50,000. 
(Ms. Romney owns 2007 and 2010 models: she keeps one at the Romneys' home in Massachusetts, the other at their house in California.)
The automotive disclosure came, inauspiciously; at the end of a major speech that Mr. Romney delivered about his plans to revive the stalled American economy by cutting income taxes and reforming entitlement programs.
Mr. Romney, who was born and raised in Michigan, began describing, as he often does, why he loves the state. 
"I like the fact that most of the cars I see are Detroit-made automobiles. I drive a Mustang and a Chevy pickup truck. Ann drives a couple of Cadillacs, actually. And I used to have a Dodge truck, so I used to have all three covered," he said, referring to the three major auto companies.

HEADLINE: Focus on Social Issues Could Shape Battle for Women

BYLINE: RICHARD W. STEVENSON


HIGHLIGHT: There are any number of ways in which the politics of culture wars might play out, but perhaps the biggest question is the degree to which the new attention on social issues might shape the battle for one of the most important electoral swing groups: moderate and independent women voters. 

 BODY:
 Rick Santorum creates a stir by speaking out against prenatal testing. Virginia's governor and legislature get caught up in an emotional debate over requiring women seeking abortions to undergo an ultrasound. President Obama, under pressure, recalibrates his position on health-insurance coverage of contraception for employers with religious affiliations. 
Social issues are back with a vengeance, dominating the dialogue on the presidential campaign trail, in Congress and in state capitals. 
In an election that until this point has been almost totally defined by the economy's struggles, the abrupt return of the culture wars has introduced a volatile new element. There are any number of ways in which the politics might play out, but perhaps the biggest question is the degree to which the new attention on social issues might shape the battle for one of the most important electoral swing groups: moderate and independent women voters.
 Even before social issues were forced front and center by the combination of Mr. Santorum's new prominence, the recent battle over the Susan G. Komen foundation's financing of Planned Parenthood and Mr. Obama's decision to revise his contraception policy, both parties were tracking the sentiments of women voters closely. 
Comments by Mr. Santorum about related issues, including women in combat and the role of "radical feminism" in encouraging work outside the home, only fueled the sense that the election could present women with stark ideological choices about their rights and place in society. 
 Democrats, including Mr. Obama, have traditionally relied heavily on the female vote. From 1992 to 2008, Democrats won the overall women's vote in every presidential election, with Mr. Obama defeating Senator John McCain four years ago 56 percent to 43 percent among women, according to exit polls. (Republicans have tended to win white women and married women, with Democrats winning nonwhite women and single women.)
But in the 2010 midterm election, women, who vote in greater numbers than men, swung to Republicans, if barely, cutting deeply into the core of Mr. Obama's electoral coalition.
There are now signs that Mr. Obama is winning women back to the Democratic side. In a New York Times/CBS News poll this month, Mr. Obama came out well ahead of Mitt Romney among all women in a head-to-head matchup (53 percent to 37 percent) and essentially held him to a draw even among white and married women. Mr. Obama held much the same advantage over Mr. Santorum, who has trailed behind Mr. Romney among women voters in some state polls looking at Republican primary contests. 
 Social issues provide both parties a chance to rally their ideological bases. For Republicans, especially in low-turnout primaries, invoking values-laden subjects helps generate turnout among conservatives, both men and women. On the Democratic side, the Komen fight and the Virginia ultrasound law have been opportunities for abortion-rights and women's groups to raise money, register voters and promote their agendas.
 It is less clear how the issues might play among moderate and independent women. As one example, Catholic women, another swing group won by Mr. Obama in 2008 that Republicans won in 2010, backed the administration's stance about health coverage of contraception in this month's New York Times/CBS News poll. 
 Democrats say their opportunity is less to run on those issues in particular than to use the subject to help convince women, and especially independent women, that Republicans are moving so far to the right in a general sense that they are no longer an acceptable alternative to run the country. 
 "When Republicans focus in a very extreme way on these kinds of issues, it focuses more attention on the problems with the Republican brand," said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. "It becomes part of a larger narrative about Republican leadership and a referendum on Republican leadership over the last year and a half."
Independent women "are turned off by extremism," Ms. Greenberg said. "It's not a broadband issue for the Democratic Party, but as a targeted message to independent women, it can be very effective."
 Even in 2010, when the economy and anger over the health care law and the size of government were driving politics, Democrats invoked social issues in the closing stages of some races where they felt the Republican opponent could be labeled extreme. 
 The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, seeking to appeal to women voters on behalf of Senator Michael F. Bennet in Colorado, ran a commercial against his Republican challenger, Ken Buck, a Tea Party favorite, highlighting Mr. Buck's stances against contraception and abortion rights. (Mr. Bennet won by less than two percentage points.)
 In Arizona, Representative Gabrielle Giffords ran a commercial in the closing days of her 2010 election that called her Republican opponent, Jesse Kelly, "dangerous" because of his opposition to abortion rights and his views on other issues.
 But while social issues inspire passionate reactions along the ideological wings of the two parties, they tend not to be seen as priorities among the vast pool of voters in the middle - especially at a time when the economy remains far and away their main concern.
 "You rarely ever see social issues come up as one of the most important issues facing the nation," said Karlyn Bowman, who studies public opinion as a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative research group. "Historically, while they have been big and divisive issues in some governor's and Senate races, they tend not to be very important on a national level."
 More to the point, some Republicans said, the surge of attention to these issues could well prove to be brief, and to fade quickly away if Mr. Romney can dispatch Mr. Santorum relatively quickly and return the focus of the campaign to Mr. Obama's performance on creating jobs.
 "If Rick Santorum is not the nominee, all the attention to these issues is going to evaporate," said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. "The probability of social issues playing a significant role in the general election is minimal."
 The idea that Republicans will be branded as extremists in the eyes of independent and moderate voters as a result of the current focus on the issues is "a Democratic fantasy," Mr. Ayres said. "What will drive independent voters is whether they see improvement in the economy and progress in stopping the relentless expansion of federal spending and deficits and keeping us from going the way of Greece."

HEADLINE: Atomic Agency Says Iran Is Making a More Purified Nuclear Fuel at a Protected Site

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and WILLIAM J. BROAD; David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and William J. Broad from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- International nuclear inspectors reported on Friday that Iran was moving more rapidly to produce nuclear fuel than many outsiders expected, at a deep underground site that Israel and the United States have said is better protected from attack than Iran's older facilities.
The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency indicated that for the first time, Iran had begun producing fuel inside the new facility, in a mountain near the holy city of Qum. The agency's inspectors found in their most recent visits that over the past three months, Iran had tripled its production capacity for a more purified type of fuel that is far closer to what is needed to make the core of a nuclear weapon. 
The report is likely to inflame the debate over whether Iran is nearing what Israel's defense minister, Ehud Barak, calls entering a ''zone of immunity.'' The phrase refers to a vaguely defined point beyond which Iran could potentially produce weapon fuel without fear of an air attack that could wipe out its facilities.
The Iranians showed the inspectors the progress they had made at the underground facility, also known as Fordo, as part of the regular inspection of declared nuclear sites. They seemed eager to demonstrate that despite sanctions, sabotage and several United Nations Security Council resolutions, they were forging ahead in building a facility with a capability they insist is purely for energy production and medical research. But the Iranians know that this facility, under 250 feet of granite, is the one that worries Israel and the West the most, and the resources that Iran is putting into equipping it leaves considerable ambiguity about their intent.
For years, the Iranians have refused to answer questions raised by the inspectors about what the I.A.E.A. delicately calls ''possible military dimensions'' of the Iranian program -- evidence that some work has been conducted on warhead designs, trigger devices and similar technologies that strongly suggest that the country is contemplating using its fuel for weapons.
The White House, which has been trying to increase the economic pressure on Iran while trying to dissuade Israel from attacking Iran's nuclear facilities, characterized the newest report as more evidence of Iranian defiance. ''Iran has continued to pursue its uranium enrichment program in violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions without demonstrating any credible or legitimate purpose for doing so,'' the National Security Council spokesman, Tommy Vietor, said on Friday. ''When combined with its continued stonewalling of international inspectors, Iran's actions demonstrate why Iran has failed to convince the international community that is nuclear program is peaceful.''
Despite the I.A.E.A.'s findings at Fordo, American officials insist that Iran's overall progress has been halting at best. The report also shows that despite Iran's repeated boasts, it is still having trouble using a significant amount of next-generation equipment to make fuel. The United States also argues, in anonymous interviews and in conversations with Israeli officials, that Iran's program has a number of vulnerabilities that could be exploited should it decide to try to develop a bomb. American intelligence officials say they do not believe that Iranian leaders have made that decision, though Israeli and British intelligence disagree.
When President Obama and other Western leaders first made public the discovery of the new facility in 2009, American officials said they believed that its exposure meant it would never be used. However, the report on Friday indicated that 696 centrifuges -- the tall, silvery machines that enrich uranium by spinning it at supersonic speeds -- have been installed. An additional 2,088 have been partially installed, meaning the facility is approaching its design capacity.
The 11-page report also described how Iran has refused, in two separate meetings with inspectors, to answer questions raised in the I.A.E.A.'s last report, issued in November, about experiments that could be linked to work on nuclear weapons. Inspectors were told they could not visit a military site called Parchin, where the inspectors suspect that work was done on conventional explosives that can be used to trigger a warhead. ''Iran stated that it was still not able to grant access to that site,'' the report said.
Iran has said that it produces fuel enriched to 20 percent purity, the highest level the I.A.E.A. reported being produced at Fordo, to replenish a small nuclear reactor in Tehran that is used to make medical isotopes. That claim appears to be true, at least in part: the inspectors say a fraction of the fuel was used to manufacture a single fuel assembly that was inserted in that reactor in recent days as President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad watched. The event was televised in Iran, underscoring the country's intent to continue its nuclear program despite international sanctions and sabotage.
Iranian officials have said in recent months, however, that they plan to produce more of the fuel enriched to 20 percent purity than is needed for the reactor. ''They have now produced nearly enough 20 percent to fuel the Tehran Research Reactor for the next 20 years,'' one diplomat in Europe who closely follows the agency's work in Iran said on Friday. The fact that Iran is increasing production further has heighted suspicions in the West that it wants to stockpile the fuel in case it decides, in the future, to produce bomb-grade material. It would take relatively little additional work to get that fuel to the 90 percent purity needed for weapon fuel.
Iranian officials deny that this is their intent, and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's supreme leader, explicitly ruled out producing a weapon in a recent speech.

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Dip, but Reports Suggest a Recovery Is Under Way

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
New single-family home sales fell in January, but an upward revision to December's data and a drop in the supply of properties on the market added to growing signs of a budding recovery in the housing sector. 
In another report released Friday, a survey reported an uptick in consumer sentiment, surpassing analysts' expectations.
The Commerce Department said new-home sales slipped 0.9 percent in January, to a seasonally adjusted 321,000-unit annual rate. December's sales rate was revised up to 324,000 units, the highest in a year, from the previously reported 307,000 units.
October and November sales also were revised higher. Although sales fell last month, they were higher than economists' expectations for a 315,000-unit rate. Compared with January last year, new-home sales were up 3.5 percent.
Despite the weak sales last month, details of the report offered further signs of gains in the housing market, with the months' supply of homes on the market falling to 5.6 months, the lowest since January 2006.
That compared with 5.7 months in December. A six-month supply is generally considered ideal.
The median price for a new home rose 0.3 percent, to $217,100, the highest level since October. Compared with January last year, the median price was down 9.6 percent. The inventory of new homes on the market was the lowest on record.
''The report shows traction for a housing industry anxious to ascend from the bottom,'' said Mitchell C. Hochberg, principal at Madden Real Estate Ventures in New York. ''To climb back, the foreclosure overhang needs to clear, prospective home buyers must find it less difficult to qualify for a mortgage and consumer confidence must improve.''
Demand for housing could be helped by the strengthening economy, especially the labor market, which is helping to lift confidence among Americans.
Consumer sentiment improved to a 12-month high in February as Americans became more confident about the economy's resilience, a survey released on Friday showed. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's final reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment edged up to 75.3 in February, from 75.0 in January.
It surpassed economists' expectations of 73.0 and recovered from a decline to 72.5 in February's preliminary reading.
''It is not that surging oil prices, instability in the Mideast, the European crisis or uncertainties about future tax and spending policies could not ultimately derail the recovery, but that consumers expect the pace of overall economic growth to continue to slowly restore lost jobs despite these potential problems,'' the survey director, Richard Curtin, said in a statement.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions eased to 83.0 from 84.2 but its gauge of consumer expectations rose to its highest in a year, at 70.3 from 69.1.

HEADLINE: Haiti's Prime Minister Quits After 4 Months

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
Haiti, whose recovery from the January 2010 earthquake has been stalled in part by political turmoil, has been dealt yet another setback with the resignation on Friday of its prime minister after weeks of mounting tension with President Michel Martelly and his cabinet.
The prime minister, Garry Conille, who served for only four months, was Mr. Martelly's third choice and the only one who met with approval from a Parliament dominated by political opposition. 
At the time, his appointment was seen as an important compromise, endorsed by former President Bill Clinton, to help jump-start foreign investment and $4.5 billion in promised aid. Only half of that has been delivered by international donors squeamish about Haiti's political instability.
Diplomats trying to quicken the pace of rebuilding saw the crisis brewing with growing worry -- on Thursday, the head of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Haiti called for all parties to work things out -- but apparently could do little to stop it.
Mr. Martelly and Mr. Conille had long had an awkward relationship. Mr. Martelly, who campaigned on shaking up the system, saw Mr. Conille as too bureaucratic and officious, while Mr. Conille, who runs the day-to-day operations of government and answers to Parliament, began complying more with its members' demands, at the expense of angering ministers.
Their tension, a kind of tradition in Haiti with a revolving door of prime ministers in years past, began spilling out in public.
A few weeks ago, Mr. Martelly angrily interrupted a private meeting that Mr. Conille was conducting with Parliament members, suggesting they were collaborating against him, according to Western diplomats and government officials. How explicitly Mr. Martelly showed his anger is in dispute, but, while playing down the tension to reporters later, he conceded there was yelling.
A Parliament commission is investigating whether government officials hold other nationalities, which the Constitution bars for their positions, and Mr. Conille, over Mr. Martelly's objections, had pressed administration officials to submit passports and other documents. Mr. Martelly has been dogged by rumors he has an American passport, which would disqualify him as president.
Damian Merlo, a senior adviser to the president, said Mr. Martelly was once a legal resident of the United States but surrendered his green card to the embassy before he took office in May. ''The president does not have, nor has had, U.S. citizenship,'' he said Friday.
It was unclear when Mr. Martelly would appoint a new prime minister, amid speculation that he would turn to his foreign minister, Laurent Lamothe, or another cabinet member.
Mr. Martelly has said coping with an opposition Parliament has been one of the hardest adjustments to his job, but political analysts said it was bound to happen, given the president's career as a bandleader not used to having his orders challenged. Some analysts wondered whether he would await the possibility of a more favorable Parliament in May elections before submitting his choice of Mr. Conille's successor for approval.
''President Martelly, as an artist, leads our country also as such,'' said Jean-Junior Joseph, a blogger and former aide to prime ministers. ''When no one expects, he has the ability to twist things around artistically in his favor while the band keeps moving on.''
Still, diplomats urged Mr. Martelly and Parliament to move quickly, with so much at stake for the country, where chronic poverty persists and half a million people displaced by the quake still live in tent camps.
''We continue to believe that political stability in Haiti is critical to its ability to attract the domestic and foreign investments needed to increase economic development and create jobs,'' the United States Embassy said.

HEADLINE: Caution Sets In as Indexes Hit Feel-Good Heights

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Brian X. Chen and Nelson Schwartz contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As summer approached in 2008, oil prices were surging, the housing market was collapsing and banks were bleeding money. Soon, Lehman Brothers would collapse and shock the financial system, sending stocks plunging. Investors dug out of that hole this week.
The broad market gauge, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, closed Friday at its highest level since June 2008. The 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average briefly cracked the psychological barrier of 13,000, last surpassed in spring 2008, but didn't manage to end the session above that.
''We have come a long way,'' said Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight. ''But the overall economy is clearly not back to normal yet.''
''It does not mean the economy is out of the woods,'' he added. ''It means that we have had almost four years where if you held on in the stock market through the period, you would be back where you started.'' 
The gains so far this year have pushed the S.& P. 500 nearly 25 percent higher than its most recent lowest point, on Oct. 3, 2011. The index has risen more than 100 percent since the March 9, 2009, low of 676.53. Its close at 1,365.74 on Friday is still well off its record high of 1,565.15 on October 2007.
Over time, a tug of war has ensued below the surface of the index. From June 2008 until Friday, consumer discretionary and technology stocks have been the top two gainers, surging more than 32 percent and 19 percent, while financial stocks have declined the most, falling more than 40 percent.
The technology sector has held strong since 2008 because of a cycle of ''replacement technology,'' with consumers switching from feature phones to smartphones, and from computers to tablets, said Michael Gartenberg, a research director at Gartner.
''The timing was right for consumers to embrace the technology, and the technology was ready for consumers to be embraced,'' he said.
Apple, the world's biggest company by market capitalization, fueled the ascent. The growth rate of the S.& P. 500 for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 5.9 percent compared with the quarter a year ago, and if Apple were removed from the equation, that number would drop to 2.8 percent, said John Butters, an earnings analyst at FactSet Research.
Apple, which closed Friday at $522.41, is up 176 percent since June 2008.
Along with weak capital markets, the big banks are still suffering from the aftereffects of issuing millions of new shares to build stronger capital buffers after the bankruptcy of Lehman in September 2008. While the banks, hobbled by toxic real estate loans and failed derivatives, succeeded in raising capital quickly and avoiding even deeper problems, those new shares diluted existing stock holdings.
''It took the Japanese banks years to recapitalize,'' said Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup's chief equity strategist. ''The U.S. did it very rapidly and there was massive dilution as a lot of stocks got decimated.''
Bank of America, for example, traded at more than $35 a share as late as mid-2008. On Friday, it closed at $7.88, a huge drop from nearly four years ago, but still well above its low point just below $5 late last year.
Since bottoming out in October, financial stocks have risen some 30 percent. The rally has been sharp in part because the sell-off was so extreme, Mr. Levkovich said. ''A lot of the worst performers in 2011 have been among the best performers in 2012,'' he said. ''The harder they fall, the bigger they bounce.''
Some analysts who have watched previous boom-and-bust cycles in the financial sector insist the group remains appealing, despite the recent jump.
''I think they are very, very undervalued,'' said Christopher Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer. ''People are reflexively antibank. The reality is that banking isn't like Eastman Kodak or Polaroid -- five years from now, people will interact with banks pretty much the same way they did five years ago. The need for the underlying service hasn't changed.''
While Friday brought some upbeat reports on consumer sentiment and new-home sales, the markets appeared leery of escalating oil and gasoline prices, as well as tensions with Iran and the unfinished bailout for Greece.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 12,982.95 on Friday, down 1.74 points. That the index temporarily breached the 13,000 ceiling this week was ''certainly a statistical milestone,'' said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. ''But not one worthy of uncorking Champagne bottles and having a celebration.''
The Nasdaq composite index rose 6.77 points, to 2,963.75. All three indexes were up less than 1 percent for the week.
The April crude oil contract jumped $1.94, to $109.77 a barrel.
Interest rates were slightly lower on Friday. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 6/32, to 100 7/32, and the yield fell to 1.98 percent from 2 percent Thursday.
Analysts noted that over the years, surges in the stock market did not often run on parallel tracks with the economy.
In the summer of 2008, the economy was months into recession, but some days the equities markets posted strong gains. In early August, the Dow surged more than 200 points in one trading session even as corporate profits were falling, layoffs were rising and economists were warning that the outlook for the year looked grim.
''There is a separation between the United States economy and stock prices,'' said Russell Price, a senior economist with Ameriprise Financial. He said in 2008, a lot of the market momentum came from sales growth overseas in emerging markets, and a weaker dollar that helped profits.
In 2010 and 2011, there were also gains in the early parts of the years before the markets tapered off. This was especially true last year, when the earthquake in Japan severed supply chains and oil prices surged. Stocks sank in the second half of the year because of increasing concerns over Europe's sovereign debt problems and the United States budget deficit.
''Domestically, this is the third time we are gaining momentum in this recovery,'' said Mr. Price.
George M. Feiger, the chief executive of Contango Capital Advisors, said much of the market's buoyancy was ''artificial,'' because companies were showing better earnings from cost-cutting and the banking system had been repaired through bailouts.
''Our best guess is that we might see a pattern like last year,'' he said. ''The things that brought it down in the second half, they are as bad today. I would say nothing fundamentally has changed.''

HEADLINE: Small Companies Create More Jobs? Maybe Not

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
WHERE are most jobs created in America? Is it in small companies or large ones?
For many years, the accepted wisdom has been that it is in smaller companies. But newly released figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics challenge that notion.
''The most growth in employment has been in large firms,'' said Nathan Clausen, the bureau's economist in charge of the development of the new statistics, which were released this month after more than two years of development. 
The figures cover employment from April 1990 -- one month after employment reached a high for that economic cycle -- through March 2011, just over a year after employment hit bottom after the 2007-9 recession.
Over that entire period, employment at large companies -- defined as those having at least 500 employees -- rose 29 percent, while employment at smaller companies rose by less than half as much.
At small companies, defined as those with fewer than 49 employees, the total number of jobs rose by just 10.5 percent over the period. Had the entire private sector grown at that pace, rather than rising by more than 19 percent, as it actually did, there would have been nearly eight million fewer people with jobs last March, and the unemployment rate would have been around 14 percent.
The new data was released on an experimental basis, and is shown in the accompanying charts. If all goes as planned, in July the bureau will release figures through March of this year. Within a couple of years the figures will be released with only a three-month delay and will also include information on wages and hours. That will enable analysts to see which size companies pay better, both over all and in various industries, and where pay is rising or falling.
Small-company employment seems to have been more stable in good times and bad. The numbers rise more slowly during expansions and fall less sharply during recessions. When large companies shed workers during and after the 2001 recession, the number of people working for small companies actually rose.
When the data becomes available on a monthly basis, it may help to provide indications of cyclical change. At economic turning points, small companies seem to be more nimble. In June 2007, small companies began to reduce employment, seven months before larger ones did. Small companies began to add workers in November 2009, four months before larger ones did.
The bureau also released numbers for broad industry groups, which showed substantial variations. In manufacturing, smaller companies seem to have done much better than larger ones. Employment at smaller companies fell at a slower pace during the crisis, and since then has risen more rapidly.
Seasonal variations also can vary substantially. In retailing, an area where the growing dominance of larger employers has been particularly notable, nearly all the seasonal variation comes at larger companies, as they hire Christmas-season workers. But in construction, smaller companies are much more likely to let people go during seasonal lulls than are larger ones.
So where did the belief that small companies create most jobs come from? To a large extent, it comes from another data series, known as Business Employment Dynamics, maintained by a different part of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For each quarter, it calculates the number of jobs added and lost in each size of company, and those figures seem to show that over the long term larger companies create about 35 percent of jobs, as opposed to more than 60 percent in the new numbers.
The differences may relate to how companies are classified by size. The new data classifies companies based on their maximum employment during a year. That minimizes how often companies change categories. A ski resort, with a lot of employees in the winter and only a handful in the summer, might be considered a large company based on its peak employment. In the other data, that company would change size every season. There are also minor differences in which workers are included and excluded.
But it turns out the Business Employment Dynamics data is quite similar in one respect. It also shows that the proportion of private sector employees working for large companies has been steadily rising in recent decades. By either set of data, employment levels have risen far more rapidly at larger companies than at smaller ones.

HEADLINE: U.S. Treasury Dept. Penalizes Japan's Largest Organized-Crime Group

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on Japan's biggest yakuza group, an organized-crime syndicate that operates with relative impunity there and whose far-ranging criminal activity has become a significant concern in Washington. 
In an announcement on Thursday, the department said it would freeze the American-based assets of the group, the Yamaguchi-gumi, and two of its leaders. It will also bar any transactions between Americans and members of the penalized crime syndicate. Yakuza have been tied to drug trafficking and other crimes in the United States, with particular prominence in Hawaii and California. The Treasury did not elaborate on the dollar value of United States-based accounts that might be frozen under the new sanctions.
In a statement, the Treasury said the group made ''billions of dollars'' every year around the world. Its criminal activity includes prostitution, money laundering, fraud and trafficking in humans, weapons and drugs.
The action ''casts a spotlight on key members of criminal organizations that have engaged in a wide range of serious crimes,'' David S. Cohen, under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement.
''We will continue to work with our international partners to target those who deal in violence, narcotics, money laundering and the exploitation of women and children,'' Mr. Cohen said.
The Treasury is using sanctions authority created by a 2011 executive order. In the order, President Obama said he had determined that criminal organizations -- including the yakuza, the Camorra crime syndicate in Italy and Mexico's Zetas drug cartel -- ''constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States.''
Yamaguchi-gumi; its reputed ''godfather,'' Kenichi Shinoda; and its ''deputy godfather,'' Kiyoshi Takayama, are the first to be penalized under the order.
The Treasury also announced sanctions against a major crime syndicate called the Brothers' Circle, along with several of its top members. The Brothers' Circle, formerly known as the Family of Eleven or the Twenty, is a multiethnic umbrella organization for criminal groups operating across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
The yakuza gangs, which boast about 80,000 members, have deep historical roots in Japan and have operated for more than a century. They recently have been tied to a wide range of businesses, including the nuclear industry and Olympus, the Japanese camera manufacturer mired in a major accounting scandal.
According to a 2009 report by Japan's National Police Agency, the Yamaguchi-gumi had 19,000 members and 17,400 associates, making it the biggest yakuza group. Recently, Japanese authorities have been cracking down on the yakuza, with citizens becoming increasingly intolerant of the criminal underworld. But local authorities have struggled to scrub the groups from industries where they hold considerable influence, like construction.

HEADLINE: Homes Aren't Selling, but in Apartments, It's a Landlord's Market

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
The housing market remains a potent drag on the economy as home prices continue to slip, foreclosed homes fill some neighborhoods and millions of construction workers scramble for jobs.
But one group is sitting pretty: landlords.
Unlike home prices, rents have been rising, up 2.4 percent in January from a year earlier, according to recent data, not adjusted for inflation, released by the Labor Department.
With few rental buildings erected over the last few years, available units are going fast. Nationwide, the apartment vacancy rate is down to 5.2 percent, its lowest level in more than a decade, according to the research firm Reis Inc. 
Rent increases are greatest in places like San Francisco, Austin, Tex., and Boston, where technology companies in particular are hiring, as well as in New York City and the District of Columbia. But cities like Chicago and Seattle, where house prices are still declining quite sharply, have had rental increases, too.
''We are more of a renter nation than we have been for a while,'' said Christopher J. Mayer, a professor of real estate at the Columbia University Business School.
Economists suggest favorable conditions for landlords will continue for at least a year, with employment gradually rising and construction of new apartments remaining constrained.
As job growth has begun to accelerate in recent months, young people are starting to move out of their parents' homes or away from shared rooms and into their own rentals.
Families who might previously have bought homes are also staying in rentals longer. They may be waiting for the housing market to hit bottom or finding it difficult to qualify for a mortgage. Many others remain uncertain about their job prospects and wary of the obligations of ownership.
When Charles Griffith moved with his wife and two children to Orlando, Fla., last fall, they chose a new two-bedroom apartment for $1,140 a month. They left a four-bedroom house they had bought a decade ago in Antioch, Calif. His brother-in-law has moved in and taken over the mortgage payments.
Mr. Griffith, who works as a supervisor for Southwest Airlines, and his wife, a customer service representative for the airline, are enjoying the flexibility and convenience of renting, as well as amenities like a pool. ''We kind of like the situation now of not having to be under so much pressure,'' said Mr. Griffith, 40, adding that the family may eventually buy in Orlando. But ''with the economy and the airline industry, that factors into us thinking maybe we should hold off for a while.''
The home ownership rate has been falling from its peak of 69.4 percent in 2004, according to census data. By the fourth quarter of 2011, it was down to 66 percent. That means about two million more households are renting, said Kenneth Rosen, an economist and professor of real estate at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.
Not all those people are choosing apartments, of course. Some are moving into single-family homes left vacant by foreclosures. Eager to capitalize on the trend, investors are scooping up some houses at a deep discount and leasing them to tenants who have lost their own homes.
Several prominent hedge funds and private equity firms have recently announced plans to invest in distressed properties and convert them to rentals. And earlier this month, the government solicited applications from investors interested in buying pools of foreclosed properties held by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration.
Still, it is in apartments, not houses, where renters are feeling the most competition.
Although many families crushed by the recession have doubled up and plenty of underemployed 20-somethings are living with their parents, some young people are finally getting their own space. Nearly 60 percent of job gains in the last two years have gone to people who are 20 to 34, a crucial rental group, according to an analysis of Labor Department data by G. Ronald Witten, a consultant to apartment companies.
During the economic downturn, apartment developers retrenched. The number of new apartments completed fell from 284,200 in 2006 to less than half that number in 2011, according to census data.
The limited supply is pushing up prices in some markets. In San Francisco, rents jumped close to 5 percent last year, according to Reis, and increases averaged 3 percent in Austin and New York. Landlords have also been withdrawing incentives like a free month's rent.
Liz Brent and Matt Mochizuki moved into a studio apartment a year ago in the Mission District in San Francisco for $1,395 a month. Now they want more space.
Ms. Brent, 26, makes costumes and is working as a barista at a cafe where customers leave big tips. Mr. Mochizuki, 27, has a steady job making custom metal work for a design studio. They are budgeting $1,800 a month in rent.
But at an open house for an apartment billed as a one-bedroom, they found a studio with an awkward layout and bad light. More than 40 people were in line, many ready to hand over a check.
''That's what the market is like now,'' Ms. Brent said of their fruitless search. ''That's how many people showed up for this tiny apartment with no windows.''
Some rental markets remain soft, like Atlanta and Las Vegas, the epicenter of the housing bust. Orlando, too, might seem an unlikely place for rental strength. The unemployment rate, at 9.7 percent, is higher than the national average, and home prices slipped 4.6 percent last year, according to the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home price index.
Yet Ric Campo, chief executive of Camden Properties, a real estate investment trust that owns apartment buildings, said rental business was brisk at its LaVina development. Since the office for the 420-unit complex opened last summer, more than half the apartments have rented.
That's ''a faster rate than we've ever seen in Orlando,'' Mr. Campo said. The company has raised the base rent on a two-bedroom apartment to $1,080, from $995 a month.
Many now wonder about a more profound shift among future buyers. Matt Byford, a 24-year-old litigation consultant in Chicago, acknowledges that low interest rates and low prices favor buying. But he says he is renting and in no hurry to buy, because he doesn't expect much to change soon.
Brad Forrester, chief executive of the ConAm Group, which manages about 50,000 apartments in the western United States, says, ''I think it's going to be interesting to see whether there's been a fundamental sociological shift in that 20- to 35-year-old cohort, where they literally say 'this American dream just doesn't work for me.' ''

HEADLINE: Given Greek Deal, Investors May Reconsider Sovereign Debt

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
LONDON -- As Greece starts sending out a formal debt restructuring offer to its private sector bondholders in the coming days, the hard-line approach Athens has taken, requiring steep losses for creditors, has prompted fears that other weak countries in Europe might do the same.
By passing a law this week that gives the government the right to impose a loss of as much as 75 percent on all investors who own bonds governed by Greek law, which covers 92 percent of bonds outstanding, Greece has, with one stroke, sharply increased its chances of erasing 107 billion euros ($144 billion) from its total debt burden of 373 billion euros ($496 billion).
The debt restructuring, if successful, would be the largest in recent history, and the losses by banks, hedge funds and other private investors would be among the most painful ever. In this regard Greece trails only Iraq, which imposed an 89 percent loss on its bondholders in 2006, and Argentina, with a 76.8 percent loss in 2005.
Greece has also raised the odds that, as the pain of austerity increases in countries like Portugal and Ireland -- to say nothing of Spain and Italy further down the road -- the temptation for other countries to turn a similar legal trick will grow stronger. 
More than 97 percent of the outstanding bonds of Spain, Italy, Portugal and Belgium are governed by local law. In theory, these countries could enact legislation similar to Greece's and thus pass on the cost of reducing their debt to well-heeled bondholders, rather than to retirees and civil servants.
''When push comes to shove, a government will always favor the interests of its domestic population over foreign creditors,'' said Ajay G. Jani, a portfolio manager at Gramercy, an investment firm that is based in the United States and was involved in the restructuring negotiations in Argentina.
The Greek finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, told opposition party lawmakers in Parliament on Friday that without the debt swap, the country's pension funds would be wiped out, according to Bloomberg News.
Investors in Greek bonds will have weeks to consider the offer to trade in their old paper for longer-term securities, which was officially announced Friday. The hope is that enough investors sign up for the deal that it can conclude before March 20, when Greece faces a debt payment of 14.5 billion euros ($19.3 billion).
The restructuring proposal is a crucial component of the 130 billion euro ($173 billion) bailout that Europe and the International Monetary Fund have agreed to in return for a new round of Greek austerity measures.
But the deal would have no chance of getting done if there were not collective action clauses attached to the bonds in question, clauses that will require all investors to take a loss as long as 66 percent vote in favor.
Such a step is taken only in extremes, when a country's debts are so punishing that it has little hope of ever persuading the private sector to lend to it, as is the case with Greece.
Italy, Spain and Belgium remain active international borrowers, albeit at higher rates. Bailed-out Portugal is hoping to return to the bond market in the coming years.
But after the Greek experience, investors might think twice before investing in those local-law bonds, no matter how high the yield.
Analysts expect that investors holding Greek-law bonds will accept the offer and trade for a package of long-term Greek bonds and two-year securities issued by the European Financial Stability Facility, Europe's 440 billion euro ($585 billion) bailout fund.
As the thinking goes, better to get something -- in this case, 25 cents on the euro -- than nothing, which would be the long-term value of the Greek bonds that investors would be left with if they spurned the offer.
Investors who might oppose the deal, hoping to be paid in full, are probably not those holding the Greek-law bonds; they would be owners of the 20 billion euros ($27 billion) or so of Greek bonds that are governed by English or other European law.
Brokers and traders say that there has been a rush of interest on the part of hedge funds for these foreign-law bonds. Like their Greek-law counterparts, these securities have collective action clauses. But because they apply on a bond-by-bond basis, rather than to all bonds outstanding as with the local-law variety, it becomes easier for investors to challenge Greece over any attempts to impose a loss.
''That increases the likelihood of holdouts and makes it easier to buy a blocking position,'' said Mitu Gulati, a sovereign debt specialist at Duke University Law School, referring to the strategy whereby a number of investors can effectively corner the market in a security and then force the government to rescind the discount and pay in full.
Foreign-law bonds can also be more attractive to foreign investors because they allow bondholders to pursue legal action away from local courts, which are unlikely to look with favor on foreign investor claims.
As their popularity has risen, the price of foreign-law bonds has surged. One English-law Greek bond that will pay out 450 million euros ($598 million) to investors on May 15 is being priced at 79 cents, more than double the price of similar local-law bonds, according to Bloomberg.
Traders warn that because there is so little trading volume in the bonds, pricing them is a precarious exercise, and there is no guarantee that the bonds will change hands at that price.
''There is buying interest,'' said Gabriel Sterne, an economist at Exotix, an investment bank based in London that specializes in trading and analyzing distressed debt. ''People think that the odds are pretty good that you will get paid out.''
While no one entity has emerged as a primary leader of the Greek holdout crowd, traders frequently mention Aurelius Capital Management, a hedge fund based in New York, as one that might bet there is money to be made by taking Greece to court.
Aurelius fought a bitter legal battle in Ireland over the forced losses that it took on the bonds of Allied Irish Bank, a failed lender bailed out by the government, and won a settlement that was favorable enough that it dropped the case.
A spokesman for Aurelius declined to comment.
It is far from clear, however, if any scramble to block the Greek deal by accumulating foreign-law bonds will pay off. Greece, after all, is broke, and the hard line taken by Europe with regard to forcing losses on investors leaves little chance that Athens may decide to pay off foreign bondholders so they will not sue. And if an investor were to sue, the process would take years and cost many millions in legal fees.
Mr. Jani, the portfolio manager, pointed out that 10 years after Argentina defaulted on its bonds, which were all foreign-law securities, holdout investors had not received a penny.
''If you get into a situation where you own bonds of a sovereign that does not want to pay, it does not matter what court you are in,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Getting Name Recognition the Hard Way

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
Until this week, Bob McDonnell of Virginia was a popular Republican governor with a lot of national ambition but not much name recognition. Now, after a high-profile tussle over controversial abortion legislation, he is known nationally -- but maybe not the way he had in mind.
Mr. McDonnell, 57, a retired Army officer who took office in January 2010, has been mentioned regularly in party circles as an attractive candidate for vice president on a Republican ticket. Many of the ingredients fit: He is from a critical swing state in presidential politics. He is unabashedly anti-abortion and has a long record of supporting conservative causes. At the same time, he has painstakingly built a political image that has economics -- not social issues -- as its center. And his eldest daughter served as an Army officer in Iraq.
This week that narrative hit a bump when a furor erupted over a bill before the Virginia legislature that required women to undergo a vaginal ultrasound before having an abortion. Mr. McDonnell watched as left-leaning television show hosts mocked it and -- though vaginal ultrasounds are standard practice for viewing a first-trimester fetus -- some opponents denounced it as a ''rape bill.'' 
The pressure placed Mr. McDonnell in a tricky spot. He had previously voiced support for an ultrasound requirement, but said later that he had not known the details of this bill. Members of his own party were racing ahead with legislation that he had little to do with, and expecting him to sign it. But his national political ambitions required a more moderate approach.
Eventually, Mr. McDonnell said he could not sign the bill unless Republicans softened the language to require only abdominal ultrasounds. But the bill had already done its damage, serving as a major distraction and the country's first real introduction to Mr. McDonnell.
''This runs counter to the political identity that he has so carefully constructed,'' said Bob Holsworth, a political analyst in Richmond. ''He has a story he thinks is very important to tell and that message is getting stepped on this week.''
The episode was a bitter disappointment to many anti-abortion groups, and some strategists argue that it has the potential to harm Mr. McDonnell's long-term political prospects among conservatives.
''Any hope he had of getting on a national ticket went out the window,'' said a Republican strategist who follows Virginia politics who asked that his name not be used because he did not want to be seen as criticizing the governor. ''He's the guy who pulled the plug on this and among conservatives, he's going to be suspect.''
A conservative blog, Virginia Right, posted an entry on Thursday titled ''Is Governor McDonnell Losing Virginia Christians and Conservatives?'' and the Family Foundation, a powerful anti-abortion group, strongly criticized his decision to soften the bill.
''Bob is a good governor, but he's lost sight of the Statehouse for the Blair House,'' said Don Blake of the Virginia Christian Alliance, a conservative group that supported the original bill. ''It grieves people that this is happening.''
Still, it is unclear whether such groups would stop supporting Mr. McDonnell, and most analysts said that while he was touched by the recent firestorm in Richmond, it might not have any lasting effects.
''The open question is how permanent is this and can he pivot back,'' Mr. Holsworth said.
The governor did not immediately agree to a request for an interview. His aides say they have been frustrated that he has come to be associated with legislation that was not his in the first place.
And while he did say, in a radio interview in January, that he would support the ultrasound requirement, no one, not even the bill's sponsors, according to the aide, understood at the time that it would entail such an invasive procedure.
''If you flash back to late January, no one was talking about this,'' said an aide who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. ''Why would the governor know every technical detail of every bill? It's not even part of his legislative agenda.''
The governor, ''has his agenda, and legislators have theirs,'' said the aide, ticking off Mr. McDonnell's recent policy efforts, which he said included a $230 million increase in financing for higher education in his budget. Those measures might not be sexy on television, he said, but will do a lot of good. ''The truth is, he is frustrated that so much time and energy is being spent on bills that are making headlines like this,'' the aide said.
Many analysts say that Mr. McDonnell is a man of compromise and was motivated as much by his aversion to controversy as his aspirations for national political office. His ratcheting down of the bill means that he stayed true to character, they said.
Some Democrats say they suspect that Mr. McDonnell would have signed the legislation if there had not been such a fuss about it. He was expected to sign other pieces of conservative legislation in the coming weeks, including a recently passed bill that would have the effect of preventing religious adoption agencies from having to place children with same-sex couples.
And while a ''personhood bill,'' which defines life as beginning at conception, was quashed in the Senate on Thursday in a manner that led to speculation that Mr. McDonnell was involved, a bill that would repeal government financing for certain abortions for low-income women is still pending, abortion rights advocates say.
There are still a few weeks left in the legislative session, which could potentially raise more problems for Mr. McDonnell. Katherine Greenier, director of a women's rights program at the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, said that 13 bills related to abortion were being considered by the General Assembly, up from 8 last year. One complication for Mr. McDonnell is Republicans in Virginia's legislature, who now control both the Senate and the House for the first time in a number of years, and their pent-up desire for conservative legislation.
''The headlines are gays, guns and abortion,'' said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. ''They are pushing these buttons on purpose to please the base.''
Mr. McDonnell's aide said that the governor in fact had supported the ultrasound bill, just not in as invasive a form, and that if it passes, anti-abortion conservatives would be able to hold up Virginia as one of eight states that require it. He argued that once the dust settled, the governor's political image as a pragmatist might even be stronger.
''If we come out of this with people saying, 'Here's a contentious issue where Bob McDonnell made a tough decision to calm the waters,' that strengthens his brand down the road.''

HEADLINE: Growing Yogurt Industry To Get New Plant Upstate

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
5 p.m. Updated A fast-growing industry in upstate New York - yogurt production - is about to get even bigger.
Gov.Andrew M. Cuomo said Friday that PepsiCo and a German dairy company had agreed to open a yogurt factory in the western part of the state, adding 186 jobs to an industry that has provided a needed jolt for New York's dairy farms and several struggling communities. 
PepsiCo and the German company, Theo Muller, will invest $206 million in the new plant, to be constructed over two years in Batavia, N.Y., midway between Buffalo and Rochester. The state and Genesee County have agreed to provide about $26 million in tax credits and other incentives to help attract the companies.
Mr. Cuomo heralded the deal as the latest in a string of victories for the state's dairy industry.
''This project demonstrates that leading international companies like PepsiCo and Muller see New York as a premier place to invest and the natural choice for their first venture into the yogurt business,'' he said in a statement.
The new plant will bolster a booming business in an area of the state that is more used to collapsing industries than burgeoning ones.
A PepsiCo spokesman, Jeff Dahncke, said that the new plant would produce ''a range of great new yogurt products,'' but that the companies were still working out the specific brands and types of yogurt that they would sell.
''There is tremendous opportunity for new products to enter the U.S. dairy market,'' Mr. Dahncke said. ''We also greatly appreciate the support from the local and state officials from New York who helped make this project possible.''
New York already is home to 29 yogurt plants, which altogether employ more than 2,000 people, according to the governor's office. The plants produced 530 million pounds of yogurt last year, a 43 percent increase over the year before.
Mr. Cuomo, eager to address high unemployment and to prompt economic development, has shown considerable enthusiasm for the yogurt industry. In December, after spotting a news story on an Albany-area television station, he brokered a peace agreement between two warring communities to allow another yogurt maker, Fage USA, to proceed with a planned expansion of its Greek-style yogurt plant in the Mohawk Valley.
And Chobani, another popular Greek-style yogurt, is based in Chenango County.
Last month, when Mr. Cuomo announced a wager with Massachusetts' governor over the Super Bowl, Mr. Cuomo offered not only traditional New York products - bagels and cheesecakes - but also 46 cases of Greek-style yogurt, which his office described as ''one of the state's newest and hottest exports.'' (Mr. Cuomo won the bet when the Giants won, but the manufacturers nonetheless donated the wagered products to food banks in the two states.)
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Kenneth Cole Wants to Take His Apparel Company Private

BYLINE: By KEVIN ROOSE

 BODY:
8:17 p.m. Updated
Kenneth Cole, the fashion designer who sells shoes, bags and apparel, is seeking a private label for his own company.
Mr. Cole, who is the company's largest shareholder, with 47 percent of the common stock, has offered to take his company private for $15 a share.
He said that the pressures of the public markets had caused the company to focus on short-term earnings at the expense of long-term innovation. 
''Recent market challenges have created a sharply competitive landscape, and I believe it is now more important than ever to embrace a more entrepreneurial perspective,'' Mr. Cole wrote in a letter to the company's board on Friday.
''I am convinced that private ownership is in the best interests of the business and the organization and that this proposal is in the best interests of the shareholders.''
In response, the company's board formed a special committee to evaluate Mr. Cole's bid as well as any other potential offers. The committee includes all of the board members except Mr. Cole and his chief executive, Paul Blum.
The proposal for Kenneth Cole Productions pegs the company's value at around $280 million, and represents a 26 percent premium over the 45-day average closing price of the stock as of Thursday. The shares rose 18.5 percent, or $2.42, to $15.49 on Friday - an indication that some investors believe that the designer may have to raise his bid.
Still, over the last five years, its shares have fallen sharply, as a recession dried up sales at all but the most resilient luxury brands. Kenneth Cole specializes in midmarket fashion accessories like a Meet U There loafer that retails for $148 or a women's spot print dress for $149.50.
Mr. Cole, who got his start selling designer shoes out of a trailer parked on the streets of Manhattan, has also fallen behind rival celebrity designers like Michael Kors, whose company went public in December. Its shares have since gained roughly 70 percent.
''Being public is great when the stock is working. It's not so great when it's not,'' said Faye Landes, a managing director at Consumer Edge Research.
In the letter announcing his plan to take the company private, Mr. Cole said he was committed to keeping the company's management in place, as well as its employee base of roughly 1,800, which ''he views as one of its most important assets,'' the release said.
If the buyout is successful, Kenneth Cole Productions will be private for the first time since its 1994 initial public offering. It will also be among the best-known private fashion labels. J. Crew, another retailer, was taken private in a $3 billion buyout by two private equity firms last year with the support of its chief executive, Millard S. Drexler.
''It's right out of the textbook,'' Howard Davidowitz, the chairman of Davidowitz & Associates Inc., a national retail consulting firm, said of Mr. Cole's buyout attempt. ''He's saying, '70 percent of what I've got is a jewel. It needs a little cleaning up, so I'm going to do it in private.' ''
Mr. Cole, the chairman and chief creative officer, said in the letter to the board that he did not intend to sell his stake in the company once taken private, nor would he support an outside acquisition or merger.
The buyout attempt could stall if shareholders deem it too low, or if an outside bidder emerges. ''Any of these deals is a negotiation,'' Mr. Davidowitz said. ''You make an offer, and that offer is the basis for discussion.''
But if his bid finds a sweet spot, Mr. Cole, 57, who is married to the sister of the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, will have the freedom to retool his brand without the pressure of appeasing public shareholders.
''He has access to capital, he has his name, he's well connected,'' Ms. Landes said. ''Now, he can do what he really wants to do with the business.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Online Correction: February 24, 2012, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Michael Kors had hired Willkie Farr & Gallagher as a legal adviser. The law firm was hired by Kenneth Cole.

HEADLINE: Political Memo: Social Issues Return to Dominant Role in National Debate

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
Rick Santorum creates a stir by speaking out against prenatal testing. Virginia's governor and legislature get caught up in an emotional debate over requiring women seeking abortions to undergo an ultrasound. President Obama, under pressure, recalibrates his position on health-insurance coverage of contraception for employers with religious affiliations.
Social issues are back with a vengeance, dominating the dialogue on the presidential campaign trail, in Congress and in state capitals. 
In an election that until this point has been almost totally defined by the economy's struggles, the abrupt return of the culture wars has introduced a volatile new element. There are any number of ways in which the politics might play out, but perhaps the biggest question is the degree to which the new attention on social issues might shape the battle for one of the most important electoral swing groups: moderate and independent women voters.
Even before social issues were forced front and center by the combination of Mr. Santorum's new prominence, the recent battle over the Susan G. Komen foundation's financing of Planned Parenthood and Mr. Obama's decision to revise his contraception policy, both parties were tracking the sentiments of women voters closely.
Comments by Mr. Santorum about related issues, including women in combat and the role of ''radical feminism'' in encouraging work outside the home, only fueled the sense that the election could present women with stark ideological choices about their rights and place in society.
Democrats, including Mr. Obama, have traditionally relied heavily on the female vote. From 1992 to 2008, Democrats won the overall women's vote in every presidential election, with Mr. Obama defeating Senator John McCain four years ago 56 percent to 43 percent among women, according to exit polls. (Republicans have tended to win white women and married women, with Democrats winning nonwhite women and single women.)
But in the 2010 midterm election, women, who vote in greater numbers than men, swung to Republicans, if barely, cutting deeply into the core of Mr. Obama's electoral coalition.
There are now signs that Mr. Obama is winning women back to the Democratic side. In a New York Times/CBS News poll this month, Mr. Obama came out well ahead of Mitt Romney among all women in a head-to-head matchup (53 percent to 37 percent) and essentially held him to a draw even among white and married women. Mr. Obama held much the same advantage over Mr. Santorum, who has trailed behind Mr. Romney among women voters in some state polls looking at Republican primary contests.
-Social issues provide both parties a chance to rally their ideological bases. For Republicans, especially in low-turnout primaries, invoking values-laden subjects helps generate turnout among conservatives, both men and women. On the Democratic side, the Komen fight and the Virginia ultrasound law have been opportunities for abortion-rights and women's groups to raise money, register voters and promote their agendas.
It is less clear how the issues might play among moderate and independent women. As one example, Catholic women, another swing group won by Mr. Obama in 2008 that Republicans won in 2010, backed the administration's stance about health coverage of contraception in this month's New York Times/CBS News poll.
Democrats say their opportunity is less to run on those issues in particular than to use the subject to help convince women, and especially independent women, that Republicans are moving so far to the right in a general sense that they are no longer an acceptable alternative to run the country.
-''When Republicans focus in a very extreme way on these kinds of issues, it focuses more attention on the problems with the Republican brand,'' said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. ''It becomes part of a larger narrative about Republican leadership and a referendum on Republican leadership over the last year and a half.''
Independent women ''are turned off by extremism,'' Ms. Greenberg said. ''It's not a broadband issue for the Democratic Party, but as a targeted message to independent women, it can be very effective.''
Even in 2010, when the economy and anger over the health care law and the size of government were driving politics, Democrats invoked social issues in the closing stages of some races where they felt the Republican opponent could be labeled extreme.
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, seeking to appeal to women voters on behalf of Senator Michael F. Bennet in Colorado, ran a commercial against his Republican challenger, Ken Buck, a Tea Party favorite, highlighting Mr. Buck's stances against contraception and abortion rights. (Mr. Bennet won by less than two percentage points.)
In Arizona, Representative Gabrielle Giffords ran a commercial in the closing days of her 2010 election that called her Republican opponent, Jesse Kelly, ''dangerous'' because of his opposition to abortion rights and his views on other issues.
But while social issues inspire passionate reactions along the ideological wings of the two parties, they tend not to be seen as priorities among the vast pool of voters in the middle - especially at a time when the economy remains far and away their main concern.
''You rarely ever see social issues come up as one of the most important issues facing the nation,'' said Karlyn Bowman, who studies public opinion as a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative research group. ''Historically, while they have been big and divisive issues in some governor's and Senate races, they tend not to be very important on a national level.''
More to the point, some Republicans said, the surge of attention to these issues could well prove to be brief, and to fade quickly away if Mr. Romney can dispatch Mr. Santorum relatively quickly and return the focus of the campaign to Mr. Obama's performance on creating jobs.
-''If Rick Santorum is not the nominee, all the attention to these issues is going to evaporate,'' said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. ''The probability of social issues playing a significant role in the general election is minimal.''
-The idea that Republicans will be branded as extremists in the eyes of independent and moderate voters as a result of the current focus on the issues is ''a Democratic fantasy,'' Mr. Ayres said. ''What will drive independent voters is whether they see improvement in the economy and progress in stopping the relentless expansion of federal spending and deficits and keeping us from going the way of Greece.''

HEADLINE: For Romney, a Message Lost in the Empty Seats

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Michael Barbaro reported from Detroit, and Michael D. Shear from Washington.

 BODY:
DETROIT --Mitt Romney set out on Friday to deliver a sweeping and sober vision for how to revive the American economy in a major policy speech here. In the end, he delivered something else as well: an unintended lesson about how poor visuals and errant words can derail a candidate's message in this modern political news culture.
In an unusual choice, Mr. Romney gave his speech inside Ford Field, a cavernous indoor football stadium with 65,000 seats. 
To the television audience, it appeared perfectly normal. Mr. Romney could be seen standing at a lectern in front of a backdrop that had the logo of the Detroit Economic Club, the event's host. And when the stadium audience of about 1,200 people clapped, they filled the screen as cameras panned across them.
But in the age of Twitter and the Internet, that is not all that matters.
Before Mr. Romney had uttered a word, reporters began posting pictures online showing the stadium from every available angle -- almost empty, except for the chairs set up on the field itself, near the 20-yard line.
Row after row of barren blue seats across the giant stadium made the crowd seem minuscule. Through the rapid-fire, reality-reshaping powers of the Web, a storyline for the day began to take hold that undercut and detracted from Mr. Romney's words: big speech, tiny crowd.
Ordinarily, such imagery might be overwhelmed by the news of the day: a highly anticipated, substantive address packed with previously unknown details. Mr. Romney called for a 20 percent cut in income taxes; handing control of federal welfare programs to the states; and creating private sector competition for Medicare services.
But the Romney campaign had leaked most of the speech's contents several days ago, leaving members of the news media with little to focus on -- except, of course, the scene itself.
The distractions did not end there. After Mr. Romney finished his remarks, he took a handful of questions from the audience. The final question seemed harmless: Why was Mr. Romney the best candidate to challenge President Obama?
But Mr. Romney veered off course. After ticking off his credentials as a businessman and a Washington outsider, he detailed his fleet of personal vehicles, trying to connect his love of cars with his love of Detroit. ''I drive a Mustang and a Chevy pickup truck. Ann drives a couple of Cadillacs, actually.''
Two Cadillac SRXs, to be precise. The cost of each: $35,000 to $50,000.
Once again, Twitter feeds and news blogs lighted up with Mr. Romney's latest casual reference to his extraordinary wealth -- remarks reminiscent of the playful $10,000 bet he tried to make with Rick Perry during a debate, and his remark about liking to fire those who provide services to him.
(A campaign aide displeased by the fuss later said that Mrs. Romney owns a 2007 and a 2010 model SRX, a luxury crossover vehicle, keeping one at the family's home in Massachusetts and the other at their beach house in California.)
Mr. Romney's aides were quick to dismiss the clinical dissection of the candidate's words and the location of his speech on Friday.
They said, for example, that the stadium had been selected because 1,200 tickets had been sold, and the original site could hold only 700 people. And the campaign had not selected Ford Field -- that decision, aides said, was left to the Detroit Economic Club.
But their pushback did little to change the dynamics of the day. By the end of Friday, reporters had posted pictures of President Obama's stadium speeches given at a similar point in his primary campaign four years ago. One, at a stadium in Hartford, was almost filled to capacity -- about 16,000 seats.
Mr. Obama rallied with 14,000 in Boise, Idaho, 18,000 in Minneapolis and more than 20,000 in St. Louis in February 2008.
To be fair, Mr. Romney's campaign did not treat this speech as a rally, making no attempt to fill the stadium. But in politics, it is always better to show an overly crowded site than an overly empty one.
Mr. Romney himself seemed in his speech to make light of the large space.
''I want to thank the folks at the Ford Field for making this space available for us -- I guess we had a hard time finding a large enough place to meet, and this certainly is,'' he said.
Mr. Romney may take comfort in knowing he is not the first presidential candidate who ended up with unfortunate images in a stadium.
Four years ago, Senator John McCain decided to make remarks at the Navy and Marine Corps Memorial Stadium, which has a capacity of 34,000. Mr. McCain, who attended the Naval Academy as a young man, wanted to make a point about his credentials and history.
Unfortunately for Mr. McCain, the event was a small one: his campaign had set up 64 chairs in a small corner of the stadium.

HEADLINE: Senators Urge Castro to Release American

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senior senators met Thursday in Havana with President Raul Castro of Cuba and with an imprisoned American aid worker, but they reported no immediate breakthrough on Friday on winning the American's freedom.
Senators Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, met with Mr. Castro for more than two hours on Thursday night, the first high-level meeting between the two countries in nearly two years. The senators offered to take the aid worker, Alan Gross, home with them.
''I said if he'd like us to take this issue off his hand, we'd be happy to take Mr. Gross on the plane when we left,'' Mr. Leahy said in a phone interview from Port-au-Prince, Haiti. ''He basically said, 'Nice try.' '' 
Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who along with Mr. Leahy met Thursday with Mr. Gross at a military prison hospital in Havana, the capital, said prison conditions ''are not great.'' But he said Mr. Gross appeared to be treated better than a typical Cuban prisoner.
''He's lost a stunning amount of weight,'' Mr. Coons said. ''He is very thin.''
The senators are part of a group of six lawmakers traveling to Cuba, Haiti and Colombia to widen agricultural trade with Cuba, inspect recovery efforts from the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and discuss antidrug efforts in South America. Also in the group are Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, and Representatives Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California, and Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont.
The meeting with Mr. Castro was the first high-level contact since former President Jimmy Carter dined with him in April 2010. The imprisonment of Mr. Gross has chilled any thaw that might have happened in the wake of the resignation of the longtime Cuban leader, Fidel Castro, and the assumption of the presidency by his brother Raul.
Mr. Gross, a Maryland resident, was sentenced last year to 15 years in prison after his arrest in 2009 while serving on a democracy-building project financed by the United States Agency for International Development. Mr. Gross, who was accused of bringing satellite and other communications equipment to Cuba, was convicted of crimes against the state, not espionage. Cuban authorities ''do not consider Alan Gross a spy,'' Mr. Leahy said.
Mr. Gross had traveled to Cuba five times in 2009 under his own name before his arrest.
When the lawmakers met with the Cuban foreign minister and the president of the National Assembly, Mr. Coons said, Cuban officials tried to raise other issues, like expanding cooperation on drug seizures, oil exploration, trade liberalization and immigration.
Mr. Coons said he was firm that Mr. Gross's release must come first. ''My message back was before anything else can be discussed, we have to make progress on our humanitarian concerns, and that means releasing Alan Gross,'' he said.
But Mr. Leahy said he told Mr. Castro that neither country should let one issue stand in the way of progress because that would let political elements on either side thwart warming ties.
Mr. Coons said the main goal of the talks was to assure Mr. Gross that his case remains the main impediment to diplomatic overtures. Mr. Gross told his visitors that he had walked eight miles that morning, pacing in the limited space he has, and that he does pull-ups on a metal grate in his one hour a day outside.
He gave Mr. Leahy and Mr. Coons bracelets he had woven from small plastic rings he snapped off water bottle tops.
''He wanted us to keep them to remember him by,'' Mr. Coons said. ''I have mine in my pocket.''

HEADLINE: Nations Rebuke Leader of Syria as Assault Rages

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; Reporting was contributed by J. David Goodman from New York; Hwaida Saad and Neil MacFarquhar from Beirut, Lebanon; Mark Landler from Washington; Ellen Barry from Moscow; and an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, Syria.

 BODY:
TUNIS -- Representatives of more than 60 nations and organizations called on Syria's government on Friday to halt its attacks on besieged cities and asked the United Nations to begin planning for a peacekeeping force, even as prospects for a diplomatic way out of the conflict appeared dim.
The Syrian government's assault raged on in Homs and elsewhere, with activists reporting that 103 people had been killed. Struggling to find a response, the delegates here vowed to tighten sanctions on Syria, though they have had little effect so far, and issued a call for a cease-fire to allow aid deliveries.
They pledged to provide millions of dollars' worth of food and medicine to be distributed to Syrians from Turkey and Jordan. 
But little they offered seemed likely to persuade Syria's security forces to relent in a crackdown that has lasted nearly a year, especially because Russia and China have blocked action by the United Nations Security Council.
Inside Syria, residents pleaded for more aggressive actions. ''We want from them deeds and actions, not more condemnations and promises,'' said Abdul Rahman, who joined thousands in protests in the capital on Friday.
The final statement here dropped a call by some nations for ''a peaceful, nonmilitary solution'' in favor of wording sought by the United States and others who wanted a more open-ended reference to ''a political solution'' that did not preclude military action, but did not endorse it either.
The international meeting -- a gathering of what was called the ''friends of the Syrian people'' -- was intended to demonstrate international solidarity against the government of President Bashar al-Assad and his close allies, namely Russia and China, which faced blistering criticism from Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and other attendees.
At the same time, with the death toll mounting, it underscored the deepening divisions over how to end the fighting and begin a political transition that would result in Mr. Assad's departure.
Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, pointedly expressed frustration that the world was not doing enough, though his government represses dissent at home. Later, in a meeting with Mrs. Clinton, he said that arming Syria's largely disorganized opposition was ''an excellent idea,'' though one that was not on Friday's official agenda.
''Is it justice to offer aid and leave the Syrians to the killing machine?'' he told the participants in the meeting, according to Al Arabiya television, a private Saudi-owned news channel.
The United States and other nations have ruled out military intervention in Syria, but the violence is creating a confrontation between those nations on either side of the conflict.
At the White House, President Obama said, ''We are going to continue to keep the pressure up and look for every tool available to prevent the slaughter of innocents in Syria.'' He repeated his call for President Assad to step down. ''It is time to stop the killing of Syrian citizens by their own government,'' Mr. Obama said.
But the White House's deputy spokesman, Joshua R. Earnest, reiterated the administration's reluctance to supply arms to the Syrian opposition, saying it did not want to further ''militarize'' the situation.
The request to the United Nations to begin planning for a peacekeeping mission -- which would ultimately require the Security Council's approval -- risked yet another diplomatic showdown with Russia and China. And providing arms to Syria's opposition, which Mrs. Clinton suggested the day before would happen ''from somewhere, somehow,'' raised the prospect of escalating the conflict.
''It's quite distressing to see two permanent members of the Security Council using their veto when people are being murdered: women, children, brave young men,'' Mrs. Clinton said Friday at the close of the conference, referring to last month's veto of a United Nations resolution calling for a political solution along the lines proposed by the Arab League.
''It's just despicable,'' she went on. ''And I ask, whose side are they on?''
Russia, which has emerged as Syria's main advocate, blamed the United States, NATO and the Arab League on Friday for fomenting the violence inside Syrian by supporting the opposition and denounced the meeting here as foreign interference that would fail to loosen Mr. Assad's grip on power.
''There is no situation there which would raise the question of Assad's departure,'' Aleksei K. Pushkov, a senior Russian lawmaker who visited Damascus, the Syrian capital, this week and met with the Syrian leader, said in Moscow. ''This is an absolutely artificial and far-fetched theme. Everyone who arrives there understands why Assad is not leaving: because he has no reason to leave.''
Although the leaders here cast their demand to allow humanitarian assistance as an ultimatum, they did not detail the consequences for Mr. Assad if he refused.
In what appeared to be a modest breakthrough, the International Committee of the Red Cross said Friday that the Syrian Red Crescent had begun evacuations of a small number of people from a ravaged Homs neighborhood after three weeks of constant bombardment that had left the city with many wounded and shortages of food and medicine. Negotiations to evacuate two wounded foreign journalists continued.
''There was a short cease-fire during the evacuation, with some shooting, but the full-scale bombing resumed later,'' said Khaled Abu Salah, an activist in the city's Baba Amr neighborhood reached via Skype.
To stop the bloodshed, the leaders in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, hoped to create what one official in attendance called ''a tsunami'' of diplomatic, economic and ultimately moral pressure on Syria's government and its patrons.
''If the Assad regime refuses to allow this lifesaving aid to reach civilians, it will have even more blood on its hands,'' Mrs. Clinton said in her remarks to the assembled leaders. The United States pledged $10 million in food and other aid.
She and others counseled patience, though. Tunisia's foreign minister, Rafiq Abdessalem, said that arming the opposition in Syria was a risky move. ''We don't want to replicate other situations by using weapons,'' he said, citing his own country's comparatively peaceful uprising last year, which set off the so-called Arab Spring, as a more promising model of political transition.
The meeting on Friday ended with a statement announcing that the leaders would meet again in Turkey and France in the months ahead.
Syria's opposition was represented by the leaders of the Syrian National Council, a group largely composed of exiles, and representatives of Syria's Kurds.
The council's leader, Burhan Ghalioun, appealed for international support but also sought to reassure Syria's ethnic and sectarian groups, especially the Alawites who have dominated Syria's government and economy under Mr. Assad's rule.
The participants referred to the Syrian National Council as ''a legitimate representative'' of the Syrian people, though not necessarily the only one.
The request to begin planning a peacekeeping force of Arab soldiers presumes a negotiated settlement that has proved elusive for 11 months.
In the meantime, pressure to do more increased. Prince Saud's remarks on arming the opposition were echoed by three prominent American senators, who called on the Obama administration and other nations to do even more, providing money and intelligence support to the opposition.
''What is needed urgently are tangible actions by the community of responsible nations to ensure that the Syrian people have the means to protect themselves against their attackers,'' Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, both Republicans, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, an independent, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Syria's Horrors

 BODY:
More than 5,000 Syrians have died from President Bashar al-Assad's butchery. The international community finally has a sense of urgency, but it has yet to come up with a strategy to end the killing. It needs to try harder.
There should be no illusions. This is an incredibly difficult problem. Most countries, the United States included, have rightly ruled out military intervention. Mr. Assad is determined to resist, no matter what the cost. The Syrian Army is far stronger and better armed than that of Libya's under Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. There is legitimate fear that a foreign intervention would unleash an even bloodier civil war and possibly spread beyond Syria's borders. 
The only hope is that the Syrian people are determined to resist and Mr. Assad's isolation is growing. At a meeting in Tunis on Friday, more than 60 governments and organizations agreed to intensify diplomatic and economic pressure on the Syrian leader and vowed to find ways to support opposition forces trying to depose him.
On Monday, the European Union plans to freeze the assets of Syria's central bank. The meeting called on all nations to impose additional sanctions, including travel bans on all of Mr. Assad's cronies and a wider embargo on purchases of Syrian oil. But Syria still has far too many powerful protectors.
Russia and China have blocked any action at the United Nations Security Council. Russia and Iran are selling arms to Syria. The United States and Europe need to use all of their powers of persuasion and shaming to get Moscow and Beijing to cut all ties. Iran is obviously a lost cause.
At the meeting, countries also pledged millions of dollars worth of food and medicine to help people in Syria's besieged cities. Officials suggested the aid could be distributed from border areas in Turkey, Jordan and, possibly, Lebanon. Mr. Assad is unlikely to let that happen.
Homs, Syria's third-largest city, has been under a fierce government bombardment for three weeks. Scores of people have been killed in the shelling, and desperate residents are facing severe shortages of food and medical supplies. It is time for the United States and others to take a serious look at proposals by Turkey and others to create humanitarian corridors linking besieged communities to neighboring countries or safe zones along those borders. Both would require air cover and would be risky.
The meeting also called for the creation of a joint Arab League-United Nations peacekeeping force to be deployed if a cease-fire is reached. Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, has been appointed to pursue that solution. There is no sign whatsoever that Mr. Assad will cooperate.
The worsening violence -- and the mismatch between the 200,000-member Syrian Army and ragtag rebel forces -- has accelerated calls, especially from the gulf states, to arm the opposition. Some countries are already quietly doing that. The United States this week opened the door to the possibility. At a minimum, Washington and its allies should consider providing communications equipment, intelligence and military training.
This will amount to little if the opposition -- divided along ethnic and sectarian lines -- fails to unite and offer a credible vision of a post-Assad future in which the rights of all Syrians will be respected. The leader of one group, the Syrian National Council, offered encouraging words on Friday, but there is a very long way to go. The United States and its allies will have to work hard to help them get there. The horrors and the death toll keep mounting.

HEADLINE: Transportation Bill Faces a Wall of Opposition From Both Parties

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- In contrast to the hundreds of pieces of legislation that cleave Congressional Republicans and Democrats, the one that pays for transportation projects has traditionally drawn a warm embrace from both parties, largely because of the giant piles of cash it bestows on states and communities to repair and maintain their roads, bridges and transit systems.
So it was noteworthy that three House members -- two Republicans and a Democrat, all from Illinois -- gathered here for a news conference this week to denounce the latest House transportation bill, one championed by the House speaker, John A. Boehner. 
The three, like scores of Democrats and a fair number of Republicans, were particularly rankled by the bill's plan to stop the 30-year practice of putting aside 20 percent of the highway trust fund dollars for public transit, which is a crucial mode of getting around in many areas of the country.
''Suburban commuters and motorists, who pay millions in federal fuel taxes, deserve a transportation bill that is responsive to their needs,'' said Representative Judy Biggert, a Republican from the Chicago suburbs, as Representative Robert Dold, a Republican freshman, and Representative Daniel Lipinski, a moderate Democrat, looked on with approval.
With support for their highway bill crumbling, Republican leaders spent much of a weeklong Congressional recess considering a variety of changes to the bill, including shortening it and thus its price tag, and restoring transit financing, with the hope of blunting the biggest objections and securing the bill's passage in the coming weeks.
The call from on high for changes was an unusual move for Mr. Boehner, who has given extensive latitude to committee chairmen.
But since it was presented last month by Representative John L. Mica of Florida, the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the bill, a centerpiece of the House Republicans' jobs agenda, has unraveled like a cheap sweater, with conservatives and liberals pulling equally hard on its threads. The assault illustrated again the difficulties of passing legislation in the divided Congress, even popular bills.
On the left, there has been deep criticism over the addition of oil drilling projects, including a proposal to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a proposal that has divided Congress for years.
Further, the bill would reduce spending on some safety programs, zeroing out, for instance, the Safe Routes to School, a program that encourages biking and walking.
On the right, some groups and members were aghast at the $260 billion price tag, and argued that transportation should no longer be a federal priority. ''We look forward to evaluating the House Republicans' new proposal,'' said Chris Chocola, the president of the conservative economic advocacy group Club for Growth, ''which should simply devolve responsibility for highway spending back to the states.''
Members of both parties have assailed the legislation. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, a Republican former congressman, called the bill ''the worst transportation bill I've ever seen during 35 years of public service'' and ''the most antisafety bill I have ever seen.''
Mr. Mica has appeared at times befuddled, annoyed and saddened by the criticisms of his bill, which would replace the current temporary extension, the eighth since a $286 billion, multi-year plan ended in 2009.
He continually notes that fuel-efficient cars have caused the highway trust fund to diminish in recent years, and that priorities have had to shift. ''In the past people were bought off with earmarks or some special provisions,'' he told reporters recently. ''We don't have that luxury.''
But members from both parties said that had Mr. Mica consulted more with his committee members, the train wreck that ensued might have been avoided. ''This bill was not done in an open manner,'' said Mr. Lipiniski, a member of the committee, in an interview after the news conference in Chicago. ''And I think there was a real misunderstanding of where Republicans would be.''
The bill began as something of the brainchild of Mr. Boehner, who over his career has never voted for the highway bill, because it has historically been stuffed with earmarks; the last one passed by Congress had over 6,300 such projects. He wanted a bill that would be, for the first time in memory, free of such pet home-state projects, that would contain reforms, and would streamline the approval process for federal projects and tie in the cornerstone of the Republican energy agenda: more drilling.
From almost the minute the bill was introduced to the public, it seemed less like the star of the legislative season, as Republican leaders had hoped, than a celebrity caught in Starbucks wearing pajamas and no makeup.
Mr. Mica held an outdoor news conference with only Republicans, half-joked that he would take only friendly questions from reporters, and squirmed as Representative Don Young of Alaska complained that it was ''difficult for me not to have earmarks.''
Mr. LaHood's comments came next as conservatives piled on from the other side. The bill then endured an 18-hour, rancorous committee hearing that ended in a middle-of-the-night vote approving the measure, with one Republican, Representative Tom Petri of Wisconsin rejecting it. ''It was going to be cutting funding for my state by $100 million a year,'' Mr. Petri, who is serving his 17th term, said in an interview on Friday. ''So it wasn't a jobs bill for my state.''
As the vote in the House neared and criticism mounted, Republicans scrambled, breaking the bill into three parts. The committee charged with setting the rules for the vote canceled its own meeting on the measure literally in the middle of debate. ''This bill is awful,'' said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts.
In a final blow, one of the key forms of paying for the bill, a provision to have federal employees pay more into their pensions, was used instead to help pay for the extension of unemployment benefits, and the bill was postponed in its entirety until after the recess.
Even with Mr. Boehner's potential changes to the bill, it would still face an uphill battle in the Senate, where members have their own more modest bill to extend current financing. That measure, a bipartisan effort between Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, and Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, has been bedeviled by a host of unrelated amendments. It does not have a drilling component.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Russian Trade Ties Face Some Political Snags

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- With relations between Russia and the United States on edge over Syrian policy and strident anti-American statements by the Russian government in response to political protests here, the Obama administration and its Democratic allies in Congress have begun an aggressive push to end cold-war-era trade restrictions and make Russia a full trade partner.
The seemingly incongruous and politically fraught campaign to persuade Congress to grant permanent, normal trade status reflects a stark flip in circumstances: suddenly, after more than 35 years of tussling over trade, Russia has the upper hand.
In December, Russia became the last major economy to win admission to the World Trade Organization -- a bid that was supported by the Obama administration because it required Russia to bring numerous laws into conformity with international standards, including tighter safeguards for intellectual property. It was also part of the so-called reset in relations with the Kremlin. 
But if Congress does not repeal the restrictions, adopted in 1974 to pressure the Soviet Union to allow Jewish emigration and now largely irrelevant, the United States will soon be in violation of W.T.O. rules. American corporations could be put at a serious disadvantage -- paying higher tariffs, for instance, than European and Asian competitors, which would immediately enjoy the benefits of Russia's new status.
A number of big-name companies have important interests in Russia, including Caterpillar, John Deere, Boeing and United Technologies.
''We would come out a big loser,'' Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat and chairman of the Finance Committee, said in an interview in Moscow, where he met this week with President Dmitri A. Medvedev and other senior officials, as well as American business leaders, to discuss the trade situation. ''Other countries will gain market share in Russia at the expense of the United States.''
Mr. Baucus, whose committee has jurisdiction over tax and trade policy, arrived in St. Petersburg straight from winning a fierce fight on Capitol Hill to extend a temporary cut in payroll taxes, a fight that illustrated how excruciatingly difficult it is to pass legislation in a divided Congress these days even when Republicans and Democrats agree on the desired outcome.
Winning repeal of the 1974 trade restrictions, known as the Jackson-Vanick amendment, and approval of permanent normal trade relations with Russian will probably prove harder still.
First, there is the burst of anti-American talk that many observers of Russian-American relations say is the ugliest in recent memory. Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, who is running for president, has accused Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the United States of stirring political unrest, including the huge street protests that have taken place here in recent months.
The newly arrived American ambassador, Michael A. McFaul, who was President Obama's senior adviser on Russia at the White House, has also come under attack, accused of being sent to foment revolution.
Then, there is Russia's effort to block international intervention in Syria, including its veto, along with China, of a United Nations Security Council resolution calling on President Bashar al-Assad to step down. To the dismay of American officials, Russia has continued to ship weapons, medicine, food and other supplies to Syria, essentially providing both a practical and political lifeline to Mr. Assad's government in the name of respecting Syria's sovereignty.
Mr. Baucus raised the American concerns about Syria in his meeting with Mr. Medvedev, who expressed a desire to work with the United States but reiterated a general sentiment among Russian officials that they had been betrayed after agreeing not to block a Security Council resolution authorizing a no-fly zone over Libya to protect civilians. In their view, the resolution was used to justify airstrikes that drove Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi from power.
Some officials here suggested that the meetings between Mr. Baucus and senior Russian leaders, including First Deputy Prime Minister Igor I. Shuvalov, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov, Economic Development Minister Elvira S. Nabiullina and Agriculture Minister Yelena Skrynnik, signaled that the anti-Americanism is largely presidential campaign theatrics intended for Russia's domestic audience and that Moscow is still committed to working with the United States.
The W.T.O. sets the rules governing global commerce and provides a forum for resolving disputes. Russia had sought to become a member for most of two decades, and some studies predict that it stands to gain as much as one percentage point in annual economic growth from membership. But even if the anti-Americanism subsides and order is restored in Syria, other obstacles remain.
More than two dozen members of Congress have signed on in support of legislation that would deny travel visas to Russian officials, and others around the world, linked to human rights abuses. The bill is named for Sergei L. Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who was arrested and died in prison after trying to expose a huge tax fraud by government officials. His supporters say he was denied medical care.
Sponsors of the bill, including Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, say they intend to attach it to any legislation to normalize trade relations with Russia. Supporters include Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is a fierce critic of the Russian government. The Obama administration opposes the bill, saying that it interferes with the State Department and that steps have been taken to deny visas to accused violators of human rights.
''There is more that we can do to support human rights, civil society and freedom of expression in Russia,'' Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, said in a recent floor speech. ''Passing the Magnitsky bill is one of them.''
Mr. Magnitsky's legal client, a British financier named William F. Browder, has made it a personal mission to win justice in the case, including approval of the legislation, and has hired a prominent Washington lobbyist to increase the pressure on Capitol Hill.
There are also humdrum issues of actual trade policy, including some agreements that need to be reached on regulations on pork products.
In trying to overcome the political obstacles, the Obama administration could face opposition from those who say that any concessions to Russia are not worthwhile, given the major disagreements on foreign policy, human rights and concerns about corruption, and especially because the amount of trade with Russia is small. There were slightly more than $8 billion in American exports to Russia in 2011, compared, for instance, to more than $100 billion to China.
To highlight the importance of the Russian market to individual companies, Mr. Baucus visited a John Deere factory in Russia, which he said helped support jobs in the United States, including at three suppliers in his home state, Montana.
In an interview, Mr. Baucus said that despite the uphill battle of passing any legislation in a presidential election year, he believed that Congress would ultimately see the wisdom of normalizing trade relations with Russia, or at least recognize that failing to do so would only punish American business.
''Even though this is an election year, the logic is unassailable,'' he said. ''This makes good sense for America. It will help create more American jobs.''

HEADLINE: Mitt, Michigan and a Couple of Cadillacs

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
Mitt Romney just can't stop wealth allusions from creeping into the conversation.
He did it again on Friday. At the end of a speech about his economic plan before the Detroit Economic Club, when it felt as though he was just winging it, he said: ''I love this country. I actually love this state. This feels good being back in Michigan. Um, you know the trees are the right height. The, uh, the streets are just right. I like the fact that most of the cars I see are Detroit-made automobiles. I drive a Mustang and a Chevy pickup truck. Ann drives a couple of Cadillacs, actually.''
Two Cadillacs? 
That's rich, literally.
That's not what you want to say when you are in Detroit, which, as I pointed out last week, has the highest poverty rate of any big city in America.
That's not what you want to say in a city where Megan Owens of the Detroit-based advocacy organization Transportation Riders United said on Friday that roughly half of its bus service has been eliminated in the past five or so years.
That's not what you want to say when discussing a tax-cut plan that, according to models prepared by the Tax Policy Center, would heavily weight the benefits toward the top of the income spectrum.
That's not what you want to say when, as David Cay Johnston of Reuters pointed out this week, Romney's plan would:
''Raise taxes on poor families with children at home and those going to college. Romney does this by reducing benefits from the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit and by ending the American Opportunity tax credit for college education.''
That's probably not the thing to say in Detroit after arguing in a now-famous New York Times Op-Ed article against the auto bailouts, saying: ''If General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye.''
That was probably not the thing to say on the day after Steven Rattner, the lead adviser on the Obama administration's auto task force in 2009, smacked you down in a New York Times Op-Ed article for suggesting that the government ''should have stayed on the sidelines'' and allowed the companies to go through '' 'managed bankruptcies' financed by private capital.''
As Rattner put it:
''That sounds like a wonderfully sensible approach -- except that it's utter fantasy. In late 2008 and early 2009, when G.M. and Chrysler had exhausted their liquidity, every scrap of private capital had fled to the sidelines. I know this because the administration's auto task force, for which I was the lead adviser, spoke diligently to all conceivable providers of funds, and not one had the slightest interest in financing those companies on any terms. If Mr. Romney disagrees, he should come forward with specific names of willing investors in place of empty rhetoric. I predict that he won't be able to, because there aren't any.''
Ouch. I need to catch my breath after that one.
O.K., carrying on.
The ''couple of Cadillacs'' comment probably wasn't the thing to say the day after the Pew Research Center found that most Americans now support the bailouts, with 56 percent saying ''the loans the government made to G.M. and Chrysler were mostly good for the economy.''
That probably wasn't the thing to say in a city where you published an op-ed in The Detroit News on Valentine's Day continuing to argue against the bailout, saying:
''This was crony capitalism on a grand scale. The president tells us that without his intervention things in Detroit would be worse. I believe that without his intervention things there would be better.''
That probably wasn't the thing to say the week that your campaign felt the need to remove this lovely little passage from The Detroit News's endorsement of you before sending it to reporters:
''We disagree with Romney on a point vital to Michigan -- his opposition to the bailout of the domestic automobile industry. Romney advocated for a more traditional bankruptcy process, while we believe the bridge loans provided by the federal government in the fall of 2008 were absolutely essential to the survival of General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. The issue isn't a differentiator in the G.O.P. primary, since the entire field opposed the rescue effort.''
The Detroit Free Press's endorsement this week echoed the complaint about Romney's opposition on the bailouts, calling him ''dead wrong'' and saying that in the past year he has been ''refashioning himself as something other than what his record suggests. He has made gestures toward economic and social radicalism, and eschewed the common sense of cooperative governing that made him a success in Massachusetts.''
But what is likely more telling about Romney's ineloquence and continued wealth-tainted asides that draw attention away from his message onto his wallet is this gem from his Friday endorsement by The Arizona Republic:
''There are better orators in American politics. Indeed, the Democrats appear to have one. And certainly there are Republicans who better project the passion for the office they seek. Steady, unflappable Romney would not a 'passion president' make.''
So, poor oratory, anemic passion, possessed of ''utter fantasy,'' and gestures toward radicalism while cruising in a couple of Caddies: That's probably not the image you want going into a make-or-break primary.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Russia's Stock Investors Betting on Putin's Re-election

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Five candidates are still campaigning in Russia's presidential election, but investors in the country's stock exchange seem to have already called the race. 
Equity analysts say a rally in the Russian market ahead of the election, still a week away, shows that investors are confident that Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin will win the election smoothly and with enough legitimacy to avoid short-term political and economic instability.
Since the beginning of the year, the Russian stock market has regained the ground it lost late last year, when street protests erupted in Moscow.
Those protests have since grown, but so has investor confidence that they pose no serious challenge, at least in the short term, to Mr. Putin and may in fact exert a positive influence on equity markets by elevating pressure on his government to bring about economic change. Rising oil prices have also helped bolster confidence in Russia's resource-dependent economy.
''We had a bit of overshooting in the perception of political risk in December,'' said Yaroslav Lissovolik, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank in Moscow. ''We've seen a change in the perception of this movement in the short to medium term.''
Investors' calculations, too, have changed.
Russia's dollar-denominated RTS index dropped faster than any other major market in the world in December when the protests against Mr. Putin began. That month, the index dropped 10.3 percent, compared with a 1.3 percent decline, on average, for all emerging market stock exchanges in December, according to the MSCI emerging markets index.
Russia has now recovered this relative loss. The RTS closed on Friday up 24.1 percent for the year, compared with a 15.5 percent gain for emerging markets generally, according to the Morgan Stanley index.
Mr. Putin promotes himself as a candidate who can guarantee stability for Russian citizens. Investors are also interested in political stability because the Russian stock market is already volatile for other reasons.
Investors still face a number of risks, including a decline in the prices for oil and other commodities that underpin the economy. Another concern is that the government will stall on promised policy changes intended to reduce the dependence on cyclical commodity prices.
''Our interest as investors, and their interests as citizens who want to improve the business and economic environment, are the same,'' Roland Nash, senior partner and the chief investment strategist of Verno Capital, an investment management firm in Moscow, said of the protesters.
Analysts also attribute the rebound in Russian stocks to factors unrelated to Russian politics: rising oil prices because of unrest in the Middle East and positive economic news from the United States.
''If the global markets go up, the Russian market goes up even more,'' said Peter Westin, the chief economist at Aton, an investment bank in Moscow. ''The politics haven't gone away.''

HEADLINE: China: Nuclear Talks With North Korea Make Progress but Reach No Agreement

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Two days of talks designed to start the process of ridding North Korea of its nuclear arsenal made some progress but fell short of any concrete results, the chief American negotiator said on Friday.
The fact the talks took place relatively soon after the ascension of the new North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, was in itself helpful and opened a small window on to the secretive country, the negotiator, Glyn T. Davies, said.
''We've been able to illuminate the issues a bit better and gain a better understanding of their rationale,'' Mr. Davies said after a third and final session in Beijing with the North Korean vice foreign minister, Kim Kye-gwan, and a team of North Korean diplomats. 
The talks focused on trying to persuade the North Koreans to suspend operations at a uranium enrichment plant and to agree to international inspectors to verify the suspension.
In December, just before the death of Kim Jong-il, who led North Korea for 17 years, the Obama administration was believed to have come close to an arrangement for such a freeze. Kim Jong-un, the son of Kim Jong-il, is largely unknown to Washington, and the talks in Beijing were seen as an opportunity to take a measure of his positions.
Mr. Davies, without offering specifics, suggested that the talks in Beijing on Thursday and Friday had again almost reached the goal of suspension of activities at the uranium enrichment plant but narrowly failed to bridge differences.
The meetings were the third round of talks since last summer between the United States and North Korea that are aimed at persuading North Korea to accept ''pre-steps'' that would then lead to the resumption of six-nation talks involving the United States, South Korea, Japan, Russia and China.
The United States wants North Korea to also improve its relations with South Korea, an American ally, as a condition for the resumption of the six-nation talks.
Those multiparty talks, which have been on and off since their inception in 2003, are aimed at persuading North Korea to dismantle its nuclear arsenal.
In 2006, North Korea became the ninth country to have detonated a nuclear device. In 2009, it announced it had successfully conducted a second nuclear test. In 2010, the leadership unveiled an advanced uranium enrichment plant.
Evans Revere, a former principal deputy assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs at the State Department, said the decision by the new North Korean regime to meet with Mr. Davies showed there would be continuity and stability in the leadership from father to son.
Immediately after the death of the elder Mr. Kim, Washington was awash with speculation that the new young leader, who is in his late 20s and who attended boarding school in Switzerland, would be undermined by veteran military generals loyal to his father.
''The various factors driving the DPRK to return to talks have not changed,'' Mr. Revere said, using the acronym for the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.
These factors, he said, were severe shortages of food, fuel and fertilizer that make the North Korean population among the most deprived in the world. Under the terms of an eventual agreement with the six nations, North Korea would be provided with economic and other assistance in exchange for the end of its weapons program.
But North Korea's insistence that it is ''a full fledged nuclear weapons state,'' made it extremely difficult to achieve the larger American goal of rolling back the entire North Korean nuclear program, said Jonathan D. Pollack, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and the author of a recent book on North Korea, ''No Exit.''
''Pyongyang sees political pluses in meeting with the U.S., but Davies no doubt conveyed that sustained negotiations are simply not in the cards without tangible signs and actions by North Korea that there is something to negotiate about,'' Mr. Pollack said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Auto Workers' Union Seeks to Marshal Working-Class Voters Behind the President

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
DETROIT -- The United Automobile Workers union, a primary beneficiary of President Obama's decision to rescue domestic carmakers, is now trying to return the favor.
As Mitt Romney prepared to deliver an economic address here on Friday declaring Mr. Obama's three years in office a ''failed presidency,'' hundreds of union members gathered on the top level of a parking deck as a freezing drizzle fell.
''Thank you, President Obama!'' shouted the union's president, Bob King. He gripped a bullhorn as he exhorted the crowd, ''Everyone!'' They roared back, ''Thank you, President Obama!''
It was the beginning of an effort by the U.A.W. and others in the labor movement to put their vast political organizations into motion behind Mr. Obama, testing their power in a difficult economy after years of declining membership. This is an election that both parties say could turn on their ability to win over working-class voters in the industrial Midwest, where battlegrounds like Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin could determine the outcome. 
Mr. Obama will meet in Washington next week with 1,700 U.A.W. leaders to talk about steps to ensure that the economic recovery lasts and to signal to them that he shares their concerns about income inequality and preserving the middle class, the White House said on Friday.
One of organized labor's motivating issues in the election is addressing disparities in wealth, a topic that Mr. Romney, whose worth is estimated at as much as $250 million, inadvertently drew more attention to Friday when he said in his speech that he and his wife owned four American cars, including two Cadillacs. And Mr. Romney has criticized the auto bailout as ''crony capitalism'' that benefited ''union bosses'' at the expense of taxpayers, a position that has left him battling to win working-class voters in the face of union opposition.
In an attempt to outnumber Republicans at the polls in November, union officials are getting an early start with voter registration drives in their plants. Successful efforts to curb collective bargaining rights in neighboring states like Wisconsin and Indiana are adding to a sense of urgency already heightened by the steep decline in ranks. The union has about 400,000 members -- less than a third of its size 30 years ago.
Mr. King has told local chapter officials they should aim to have conversations with every member they oversee about the importance of voting in this election. Other officials are busy raising money for the U.A.W.'s political fund.
And a new online organizing network for the union, called Gimme Five, is constantly adding new members, who are notified by text message and e-mail about events like Friday's protest, a joint effort planned with a local Democratic Party group.
''We plan to be very active in this election,'' Mr. King said in an interview. ''We're building a broad coalition that we hope will help President Obama get re-elected.''
The U.A.W.'s efforts come on the heels of activities by other large unions that have rallied to the president's side, like the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Last month it spent $1 million on advertising attacking Mr. Romney in Florida. Now it is preparing another round of advertising in Ohio, which will hold its primary on March 6.
The ''super PAC'' supporting Mr. Obama joined forces with the Service Employees International Union to run commercials mocking Mr. Romney for saying that he pays an income tax rate of only about 14 percent.
While the federal loan package to General Motors and Chrysler, which cost about $80 billion, is hailed by the U.A.W. and other unions as a success, Mr. Romney and many other Republicans see it as an example of government meddling at its worst.
In the industry restructuring that followed the auto rescue of 2009, the U.A.W., long a major contributor to Democrats, was given an ownership stake in Chrysler and became one of G.M.'s largest shareholders. Pensions of some union members and retirees were left intact, while salaried, nonunion employees took big hits.
The fight over the role of organized labor in American business is likely to be one of the more divisive of the election, with Republicans arguing that unions harm competitiveness in a global economy and Democrats saying that they are necessary to preserve a middle-class way of life.
That debate is already playing out in Michigan. In an appearance before a supportive Tea Party crowd north of Detroit on Thursday night, Mr. Romney committed himself to rolling back the rights of unions in a state-by-state effort to end mandatory enrollment at companies where a union has formed. ''It is extraordinary that we force people to join a union whether they want to do it or not,'' said Mr. Romney, who was born and raised in Michigan and is the son of a former governor and auto executive.
In Michigan, which is slowly adding jobs after losing more of them in the last decade than anywhere else, it may be harder for Republicans to argue that unions are a drag on business.
The assembly lines here are rolling out more cars. Parts makers are setting up booths at job fairs in search of new engineers. And factory workers at General Motors will soon receive $7,000 bonuses.
Unemployment is still high. But at 9.3 percent, a percentage point higher than the national average, it is nearly two percentage points lower than it was last summer.
Eric Watters, 41, a chief steward at the Chrysler assembly plant in Sterling Heights, said it still distressed him to think about the day in 2009 when his supervisor announced that the factory was shutting down. They were told to cover all the equipment as if they were never coming back. ''It was an eerie feeling,'' Mr. Watters said. ''Your entire life is hanging at the very end of the string.''
But about three years later, the plant has added a shift and is bringing in new workers -- workers whom Mr. Watters and his colleagues are now trying to register to vote.
''Being a union man, you have to be politically active, because our strength is in numbers,'' he said.
At the rally on Friday, many U.A.W. members said that the near-death experience of American carmakers had energized them in a way they did not expect.
''We've been threatened with losing our jobs,'' said Percy Johnson, a tradesman who works at the General Motors factory that produces the Chevy Volt. ''That's what this is about. And we're motivated like never before.''

HEADLINE: Consortium To Buy Two Units Of El Paso

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED; Peter Lattman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
8:31 p.m. Updated
The El Paso Corporation agreed on Friday to sell its exploration and production businesses to a consortium led by Apollo Global Management for about $7.15 billion, striking one of the biggest leveraged buyouts since the end of the financial crisis.
In buying the units, Apollo and its partners - a group that includes Riverstone Holdings, the Russian-born industrialist Len Blavatnik and several unnamed investors - are the latest to find attractive takeover targets in North America's oil and gas patch. 
''Apollo is acquiring a company with an impressive portfolio of valuable natural resource assets,'' Josh Harris, senior managing director at Apollo, said in a statement.
The deal also provides a respite from a sharp slowdown in mergers activity for the year to date. Announced worldwide deal volume has plunged 35 percent from the previous year, according to Thomson Reuters.
At the heart of the latest round of deals is a boom in drilling for natural gas and related compounds through techniques like hydraulic fracturing. Late last year, a group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts struck a $7.2 billion takeover of the Samson Investment Company, one of the country's biggest privately held energy companies.
Many of these transactions have led to a rafter of new oil and gas billionaires, whose companies were snatched up after infusions of capital from private equity backers.
Friday's deal was made possible through Kinder Morgan's $21.1 billion takeover of El Paso itself, which will create the biggest network of oil and gas pipelines on the continent. To help pay for that transaction, Kinder Morgan said it would sell off El Paso's exploration and production units.
Despite the attractiveness of those divisions, which include parts of shale formations in Texas and Colorado, analysts and investors had regarded the units as nonessential for some time. El Paso announced last spring that it was exploring spinning them off to shareholders to focus on its pipeline operations.
Those holdings had been the subject of controversy in 2003, after El Paso admitted to having overstated its proven natural gas reserves.
Last spring's announcement spurred interest from potential buyers, according to a person briefed on the matter. But it took the Kinder Morgan deal and a formal auction of the businesses to prompt formal interest from Apollo and other suitors.
Apollo and its partners were regarded as formidable candidates relatively early on in the process, in part because they sought to buy the El Paso businesses in one transaction, making for a cleaner sale, according to people briefed on the matter.
Within the corps of advisers to the Apollo consortium, the deal was known internally as ''Project Everest,'' according to a person briefed on the matter.
Apollo has struck a number of energy deals in recent years, including selling Parallel Petroleum to a unit of Samsung in December for nearly $800 million after buying the company in 2009 for about $483 million. And Riverstone is a well-known investor in energy companies, having participated in at least 24 deals last year, according to data from Capital IQ.
The Apollo-led group is expected to put up about $3 billion in capital to back the deal, a relatively high amount of equity for a leveraged buyout but fairly standard for an energy deal. The consortium will also draw upon about $5.5 billion in financing arranged by seven banks, led by Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase.
One possible hitch for Friday's deal is a lawsuit filed in Delaware by El Paso shareholders arguing that the company's sale to Kinder Morgan is flawed and should be reopened to other potential buyers. The Apollo-led leveraged buyout is contingent on the closing of the earlier deal, according to one of the people briefed on the matter.
El Paso was advised by Evercore Partners and Barclays Capital.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Letter, Buffett Says Successor at Berkshire Is Lined Up

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Warren E. Buffett, 81, did not name the candidate, and emphasized that he and his longtime business partner, the 88-year-old Charlie Munger, were not going anywhere. 

 BODY:
It has long been one of Wall Street's favorite guessing games: Who will succeed Warren E. Buffett as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway
Mr. Buffett, in his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders on Saturday, said for the first time that he had chosen a successor. But Mr. Buffett, 81, did not name the candidate, and emphasized that he and his longtime business partner, the 88-year-old Charlie Munger, were sticking around.
"Do not, however, infer from this discussion that Charlie and I are going anywhere; we continue to be in excellent health, and we love what we do," wrote Mr. Buffett, who over five decades has built Berkshire, based in Omaha, into one of America's largest companies.
By signaling a clear succession plan, Mr. Buffett hopes to reassure investors who have expressed concern over Berkshire's future leadership. Berkshire's share performance has lagged the broader stock market over the last two years, and Wall Street analysts partly blame the uncertainty surrounding a new chief executive.
It was only a year ago that Berkshire disclosed in a securities filing that it had identified four current managers "who are capable of being C.E.O." But just weeks after that filing, David Sokol, a top lieutenant of Mr. Buffett whom many considered the front-runner, resigned when he was accused of violating the company's insider trading policies.
Mr. Sokol's departure, a major embarrassment for Mr. Buffett, went unmentioned in the letter. But he praised the work of several executives who are thought to be leading candidates to succeed him as chief, including Ajit Jain, the head of the company's reinsurance operations; Tad Montross, chief of the insurance business General Re; and Matthew Rose at the railroad unit Burlington Northern Santa Fe.
Beyond succession issues, the 22-page letter delved into the performance of Berkshire's vast holdings, providing insights into the country's business prospects.
"In short, when you look at Berkshire, you are looking across corporate America," wrote Mr. Buffett, whose net worth is about $50 billion, according to Forbes magazine.
With a market capitalization of about $200 billion, Berkshire ranks among the top 10 most valuable companies in the United States, roughly the same size as General Electric and Google. The conglomerate has holdings large and small, like the giant utility MidAmerican Energy and the modest confectioner See's Candies.
Berkshire on Saturday reported net income last year of about $10.3 billion, which was off 21 percent from 2010. The company's book value, or net worth - Mr. Buffett's preferred yardstick for performance - increased 4.6 percent, outpacing the broader stock market's 2.1 percent return.
Among the assets that weighed on Berkshire's performance were its holdings in the housing sector, which include the homebuilder Clayton Homes, the carpet maker Shaw and Acme Brick.
"Last year, I told you that 'a housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so,' " wrote Mr. Buffett. "I was dead wrong."
He said that housing remained in a depression and was "the major reason a recovery in employment has so severely lagged the steady and substantial comeback we have seen in almost all other sectors of our economy."
"Wise monetary and fiscal policies play an important role in tempering recessions, but these tools don't create households nor eliminate excess housing units," Mr. Buffett added. "Fortunately, demographics and our market system will restore the needed balance - probably before long."
Only then, Mr. Buffett said, will home building pick up and unemployment substantially drop.
Many Wall Street investors pay the closest attention to Berkshire's roughly $100 billion in stock and bond holdings. The stock portfolio's biggest change in 2011 was Mr. Buffett's $11 billion investment in International Business Machines, a purchase that gave Berkshire a 5.5 percent stake in the technology giant.
"As was the case with Coca-Cola in 1988 and the railroads in 2006, I was late to the I.B.M. party," Mr. Buffett said. "I have been reading the company's annual report for more than 50 years, but it wasn't until a Saturday in March last year that my thinking crystallized. As Thoreau said, 'It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.' "
Last August, Mr. Buffett also made a $5 billion investment in the preferred shares of Bank of America, a vote of confidence for the struggling financial institution. On Saturday, Mr. Buffett said the banking industry was "back on its feet."
At Bank of America, Mr. Buffett said that "some huge mistakes were made by prior management" but that its current chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, "has made excellent progress in cleaning these up, though the completion of that process will take a number of years."
In his annual dispatch, Mr. Buffett steered clear of the tax-reform debate. In recent months, he made as many headlines in Washington as he did on Wall Street, inserting himself into the debate over whether the United States government should raise taxes on the wealthy. In an opinion article in The New York Times, Mr. Buffett told Congress to stop "coddling" him and other affluent Americans. He called on lawmakers to increase their taxes and close loopholes to address the soaring budget deficit.
He said in the article that his tax rate of 17 percent was a lower percentage than the rate paid by anyone else in his office, including his secretary.
The White House seized upon Mr. Buffett's piece. President Obama has made "the Buffett Rule" - a mandate that millionaires pay at least 30 percent of their incomes in taxes - a focus of his efforts to overhaul the tax code. Mr. Buffett's secretary, Debbie Bosanek, sat in Michelle Obama's box at the State of the Union address last month.
He remains at the center of the tax-reform debate. Last week, in a television interview on CNN, Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, said that Mr. Buffett should "just write a check and shut up."
Mr. Buffett has said that when he dies, Berkshire will split his job into three parts - a chief executive, a nonexecutive chairman and several investment managers of its large stock and bond portfolio. Late last year, he said that his son Howard Buffett would succeed him as nonexecutive chairman.
On the money-management side of the business, Mr. Buffett highlighted in his letter his recent hiring of two previously unheralded money managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, to help oversee his $77 billion stock portfolio.
"Both of these men have outstanding investment skills," Mr. Buffett wrote. "Each will be handling a few billion dollars in 2012, but they have the brains, judgment and character to manage our entire portfolio when Charlie and I are no longer running Berkshire."
He said that Mr. Combs had already built a $1.75 billion portfolio, and Mr. Weschler would soon create one of a similar size.
"Both Ted and Todd will be helpful to the next C.E.O. of Berkshire in making acquisitions," Mr. Buffett wrote. "They have excellent 'business minds' that grasp the economic forces likely to determine the future of a wide variety of businesses. They are aided in their thinking by an understanding of what is predictable and what is unknowable."
In searching for clues into Mr. Buffett's successor, the letter perhaps heaped the most explicit praise on Mr. Jain, the head of Berkshire's large reinsurance business. Mr. Jain, 60, is a native of India who graduated from Harvard Business School and worked at the consulting firm McKinsey earlier in his career. He has worked at Berkshire for more than two decades.
"His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, most importantly, brains in a manner that is unique in the insurance business," Mr. Buffett wrote. "Charlie would gladly trade me for a second Ajit. Alas, there is none."

HEADLINE: The Weekend Word: Returning the Favor

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at the president's weekly address and happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times
The United Automobile Workers union, a primary beneficiary of President Obama's decision to rescue domestic car makers, is now trying to return the favor, Jeremy W. Peters writes. Mitt Romney, meanwhile, is battling to win working-class voters in the face of union opposition because of his criticism of a federal bailout of the auto industry.
Style trumped substance on Friday in Detroit, where Mr. Romney delivered a highly anticipated, detailed address packed with previously unknown details about his plan for the American economy. But his message was overshadowed by the imagery of Mr. Romney speaking to a tiny crowd in a near-empty stadium, Michael Barbaro and Michael D. Shear report.
Scores of Democrats and a fair number of Republicans in Congress are riled up over a transportation bill and the stipulation to stop a 30-year practice of putting aside 20 percent of the highway trust fund dollars for public transit, Jennifer Steinhauer reports. Transportation projects usually draw a warm embrace from both parties, and this case illustrates the difficulties of passing even popular legislation in a divided Congress.
A high-profile tussle over an abortion bill has thrust Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia into the national spotlight, but not in the way he had in mind, Sabrina Tavernise reports. Pressure over what some opponents called a "rape bill" served as a major distraction to Mr. McDonnell's image of an attractive candidate for vice president on a Republican ticket.
Weekly Address
Mr. Obama will hark back to the State of the Union address in his speech this week, highlighting policy areas from January, including energy development, that he plans to refocus on in coming months. And in a speech in Miami on Friday, Mr. Obama issued a pre-emptive rejection of what he says is a typical plan of action for Republicans during an election year.
"I'll save you the suspense: step one is drill, step two is drill and step three is keep drilling," he said. "It's a bumper sticker. It's not a strategy to solve our energy challenge. It's a strategy to get politicians through an election."
His strategy relies on technological developments in biofuel, oil, gas, wind, solar and nuclear energy. But in the meantime, he proposed taking steps like ending an annual subsidy to the oil industry that costs the federal government $4 billion in taxpayer money. "While there are no silver bullets when it comes to gas prices, it's time to end taxpayer giveaways to an industry that's never been more profitable, and use that money to reduce our deficit and double-down on a clean energy industry that's never been more promising."
Around the Web
After initially being told that his campaign lacked eight signatures needed to qualify for the Republican presidential primary, a recount confirmed that Rick Santorum had met the requirements to stay on Indiana's ballot, The Indianapolis Star reports.
Happenings in Washington
The president will host the 2012 Governors' Dinner at the White House on Sunday.

HEADLINE: Santorum's Vision of America

BYLINE: KATHARINE Q. SEELYE


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Santorum painted a grim picture of American life on Friday night, offering not a feel-good speech but a feel-bad speech. 

 BODY:
LINCOLN PARK, Mich. - Rick Santorum painted a grim picture of American life on Friday night, offering not a feel-good speech but a feel-bad speech.
He was talking to a small crowd here at a Knights of Columbus hall about his plans for his first 100 days in office, assuming he wins the Republican nomination for president and beats President Obama in the fall. In the course of laying out his remedies, he described a country that sounded plagued with ills.
It has a president who does not understand why it is great, he said. Mr. Obama has created a "hostile" environment for business, Mr. Santorum said, in part because of the president's "ineptitude."
As for energy and the price of gas, "things are only going to get worse."
Businesses are being strangled by hundreds of useless regulations, all of which he will review and some of which he may repeal in his first 100 days.
"Americans don't like to be regulated," he said. "They don't like people being there and micromanaging everything they do."
Fewer than 200 people, including a group of nuns, who said they wanted to support Mr. Santorum's "stand on life," had come out on this chilly Friday night in a suburb south of Detroit to hear the presidential aspirant. They filled about a third of a small, low-ceilinged meeting hall, just days before Michigan and Arizona hold their primaries.
Mr. Santorum, who may be smarting from negative reviews of his debate performance on Wednesday night in Arizona, spoke for almost an hour, with frequent digs at the news media. His bleak recitation left his listeners, who were standing the entire time, mostly silent except for their occasional applause.
His underlying theme was that he is a man of abiding principle and conviction with a 10-point "economic freedom agenda" to revitalize American industry and limit the spending and reach of government. But his description of the problems that he hopes to address seemed to cast a pall over the room.
Manufacturing is "dying on the vine," he said, and so is small-town America.
President Obama's health care plan is "trampling" on the rights of Americans to make their own decisions, Mr. Santorum said. "This is one of the most outrageous affronts to the First Amendment in this country," he said, drawing perhaps his most enthusiastic applause.
He said the housing market was in terrible shape and noted that this had even hit home for him, so to speak. "I'm in a situation in our own house," he said, referring to his residence in a Virginia suburb of Washington. "We happened to buy in a very bad year," he said, and "the value of my house is a fraction of what it was when I bought it."
Mr. Santorum described the steel town in western Pennsylvania where he grew up as a place of hulking mills that were sitting empty. He and his neighbors reveled in the old glory days of the Pittsburgh Steelers, which was "all we had to hang on to because the steel industry was collapsing."
One of the few bright spots in his speech was his notation that Pittsburgh had "bounced back," with shopping malls and high-tech companies now occupying the old mills. "It's a great place to live again," he said, because the free-market worked -- not because of any bailout in which the government picks winners and losers.
"You may not like my position on bailouts, but I've been principled and consistent, unlike other people in this race," he said, an allusion to Mitt Romney, who is leading in delegates.
Mr. Santorum relived his own glory days, too, recalling that he was "a rabble-rouser and a troublemaker" in the House and went to the Senate in 1995 with a reputation as "a bad dude." He became especially animated as he described his protestations against Senator Mark Hatfield, a Republican from Oregon who was chairman of the Appropriations Committee, for failing to support a balanced budget amendment.
"Of course, they just beat me upside the head about as hard as you can in that town," he said, but he stood firm to his view that Republicans should stand for limited spending and limited government.
He spoke to "the breakdown of the American family," and noted that 40 percent of births now occur outside of marriage. "As a result," he said, "more and more people are on the margins of society."
Americans, he said, are inclined to take care of one another and their neighbors and build strong communities. "One of the great things about America is we believe if we just do that, everything is going to be fine in America," he said, in an urgent tone. "You know what? It usually is. But not now."
He said those in Washington were creating a system "that's going to rob you of the opportunity to do that and start managing how you do those things. And those institutions that you were going to be a part of, they're going away."
Mr. Santorum concluded by saying he had shared his vision with the people here because the news media would not write about it. "This is the vision I've been talking about since I was driving around in a pickup truck in Iowa," he said. "And you know what? Americans are responding to it. They aren't responding to all the garbage."
"They're responding to a vision about what affects them," he added. "That's what this campaign's going to be about. We're starting again here tonight, and we'll finish this campaign on a high note and a positive vision and a winning one for America."

HEADLINE: What Happens in Massachusetts...

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
BRIMFIELD, Mass. -- Spurred on by a gambling law so new that the agency charged with enforcing it does not yet exist, developers are scouring this state for places to build casinos -- looking in cities and on the coast, off the Massachusetts Turnpike, by the stadium where the New England Patriots play, and even in little towns like this one, known for its summer antiques fairs and not much else.
Brimfield, population 3,600, would be perfect for a ''New England-style resort in the woods,'' says MGM Resorts International, the company that owns the Bellagio, the Mirage and other giants of the Las Vegas strip. 
After shunning the concept for years, Massachusetts, seeking solutions to its budget woes, last fall became the first New England state to pass a broad law allowing resort casinos. Now others may not be far behind.
Under the Massachusetts law, which allows for three casinos to be built in three different regions, the state will pocket 25 percent of the gambling proceeds, plus 40 percent of the proceeds from a separate slot parlor that it will also allow. It is a potential bonanza that, combined with thousands of promised jobs, has much of New England poised to cast aside Yankee restraint and follow suit.
The type of law that Massachusetts passed is different from the more limited arrangement Connecticut has with two Indian tribes, which gives the tribes exclusive rights to offer casino gambling at Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun in exchange for a portion of their revenues.
In New Hampshire, which dreads losing tourism money to Massachusetts, lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow up to four casinos there. Maine just granted its first casino license to a six-year-old Bangor slot parlor that will add table games next month, and a second casino is expected to open in Oxford this year. Both are the result of voter referendums. Rhode Island, which already has two slot parlors, will hold a referendum in November on whether to allow table games at one of them.
In Connecticut, the two tribes that offer gambling at Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun are now worried about losing patrons to Massachusetts. The Mohegan tribe is hoping to win one of the Massachusetts casino licenses and open a Mohegan Sun location in Palmer, a town of 12,750, which borders Brimfield.
The region's compact size makes the threat of losing money to gambling enterprises in neighboring states all the bigger, said Clyde Barrow, a professor at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, who studies gambling laws. ''They already have people leaving to gamble,'' he said of other New England states. ''They can continue watching those jobs and revenues leave their state or pass gambling legislation to keep them.''
Just how many jobs and how much revenue the Massachusetts casinos will generate, though, is an open question. State officials have estimated revenues of $300 million to $400 million a year, and up to $300 million in one-time licensing fees. But in other states with casinos, revenues have often fallen short of early projections.
The industry has also struggled in the recession; Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun have each lost about 20 percent of their business since the downturn began, according to Mr. Barrow, and both are mired in debt.
So far, at least nine developers are actively seeking land or drafting casino proposals in Massachusetts, where Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, signed the law in November. In addition to MGM, they include other big-name companies like Wynn Resorts, which hopes to build near Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, a town of 17,000, and Caesars, which is looking at East Boston.
Most are promising that the casinos in Massachusetts, home to fiercely protected stone walls, white steeples and town greens, will look nothing like their Las Vegas cousins. In Palmer, Mohegan Sun has proposed a building with a trestle-like design in front -- a nod to the town's history as a railroad hub. In Brimfield, where the proposed casino site is in a valley below an overlook, MGM officials said the design would be understated, with stone and wood elements and perhaps even a grass roof.
''Envision, if you will, cascading buildings that come down the hillside so they tuck into that valley,'' said Bill Hornbuckle, MGM's chief marketing officer. Some Massachusetts towns, like Palmer, are eagerly embracing the prospect of a casino; others, like Foxborough, are already vowing to block any plans.
In Brimfield, where MGM says its project, tentatively named Rolling Hills Resort, would create about 3,000 permanent jobs, many people are taking a wait-and-see approach, said Thomas C. Marino, a member of the town's governing body, called the select board.
''The money a casino talks about can be intoxicating and the numbers are really staggering,'' Mr. Marino said. ''We don't want to get blinded by that.''
The project would need approval from town voters and from a new state gambling commission. Brimfield voters would also have to agree to change the zoning of the proposed site, which is on 150 rural acres in the hilly northwest corner of town.
MGM is also proposing that a new exit ramp be built from the Massachusetts Turnpike, which passes just south of its proposed site, to avoid routing casino traffic through town.
MGM has already opened an office in Brimfield, and the select board is seeking a consultant to help it negotiate. At a recent meeting, Diane Panaccione, board chairwoman, listed what the town might need if a casino opened. The Fire Department would need aerial equipment and a new substation. The Board of Health is worried about water supply and sewage disposal.
The elementary school might need more teachers of English as a second language -- the schools in Ledyard, Conn., hired more than a dozen after Foxwoods opened there in 1992, Ms. Panaccione said.
While not taking a position on the casino yet, Ms. Panaccione noted that it could help the town's tax base, which took a hit when two tornadoes swept through last summer, destroying 42 homes and damaging more than 100.
Virginia Irvine, a resident of Brimfield who helped lead a successful fight against a wind turbine proposal here last year, said she worried that after the tornados, residents might be more tempted to approve a casino. ''We will have a big fight about this,'' she said, ''because there are people that will say, 'How can you turn down millions of dollars?' ''

HEADLINE: A Place for Two, Drums Not Included

BYLINE: By JOYCE COHEN

 BODY:
AFTER graduating from Fordham University in 2008, Abbe Ouziel returned home to live with her parents in Fort Lee, N.J.
It was a practical move. She had graduated into a bad economy with a degree in dance.
Her friends from outside the city, who had to find housing when they were booted from the dorm, were envious. ''It was pretty great, aside from the fact I was used to living at Columbus Circle,'' said Ms. Ouziel, 25, who had spent four years there in a Fordham dormitory.
She had to get used to taking a bus and a subway to the Upper West Side, where she teaches Gyrotonics, an exercise technique. She intended to remain with her parents ''until I thought of a good reason to move and start paying rent,'' she said.
The reason surfaced last fall. Her boyfriend, Jon Shiffman, 26, wanted to move to New York City. Mr. Shiffman, a drummer, had been living with his mother in Teaneck, N.J., because he traveled so often he couldn't justify shelling out good money for an apartment. But now he was planning to switch careers and start course work at City College in preparation for the school's physician assistant program. 
''I had been on the road for the last five years and never really had a place of my own,'' he said, ''so I was extremely gung-ho about finding a place in time for classes to start. I didn't want to commute into college.''
The couple decided to hunt for a one-bedroom on the Upper West Side for $1,400 to $1,600 a month. On that budget, Mr. Shiffman and Ms. Ouziel knew they would have to go way uptown, probably beyond Morningside Heights.
Mr. Shiffman scoured Craigslist and visited a few open houses. But something was always wrong. One place had a ''pipe with towels wrapped around it, which seemed like an ominous sign,'' he said.
Ms. Ouziel's friends insisted that she would know immediately when she had found the right place, but she was unsure.
Early this winter, Mr. Shiffman contacted Michael Rider, an agent at A. C. Lawrence & Company, who had rentals in Inwood and Washington Heights. Mr. Rider took the couple to a handsome, newly renovated one-bedroom, for $1,400 a month, on West 188th Street. But it was on the ground floor, with two bedroom windows right on the street.
They moved on to Magaw Place, where another one-bedroom, small and unrenovated but livable, also cost $1,400. Now, however, they were starkly aware of the appeal of a newly redone interior. ''If we had to live there, we would have been fine with it,'' Mr. Shiffman said, ''but there wasn't any real wow factor.''
The wow came at a just-renovated one-bedroom for $1,600 a month on West 173rd Street near Broadway in Washington Heights, high enough to have a view of the George Washington Bridge. ''I kind of at that moment understood when people said that, when you walk in and feel you should be there, you'll know,'' Ms. Ouziel said.
Unprepared to have found a place so quickly, they gathered the necessary paperwork, which they provided to Mr. Rider the next morning.
But they were too late. ''We got scooped on the apartment within a half hour, which is not uncommon,'' Mr. Rider said.
Ms. Ouziel was heartbroken. ''I am green to this whole situation,'' she said, ''and never considered the fact you can apply to an apartment and not get it. But then I realized that happens all the time.'' Having seen several perfectly fine places, they were sure to see more.
A few days later, with Ms. Ouziel at work, Mr. Shiffman ventured out again with Mr. Rider, this time to a $1,500-a-month one-bedroom on Pinehurst Avenue in Hudson Heights. It was completely gutted, with renovations about to begin.
Even in its unfinished state, Mr. Shiffman liked the space, a large rectangle. ''If you are the first tenant,'' he said, ''it feels it was built for you.''
The following Sunday, Mr. Shiffman and Ms. Ouziel drove to the neighborhood. They were joined by his mother, Joanne Kennedy, who had worked for years at what was then Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. In fact Mr. Shiffman had spent his babyhood nearby on Cabrini Boulevard.
''I decided I wanted to live here before I got out of the car,'' Ms. Ouziel said. ''I had never seen a neighborhood like this in Manhattan.'' She loved the calm streets, away from busy Broadway.
Ms. Kennedy, a nurse practitioner, was thrilled to revisit her old neighborhood. ''Oh, my heavens, it brought back such nostalgia,'' she said. Frank's Market on West 187th Street, once a butcher shop, was now a gourmet purveyor. ''This place had such a renaissance. It was wild. I loved it.''
This time the only glitch was the landlord's concern about having a drummer for a tenant. Mr. Shiffman allayed those fears: he keeps his drums at his mother's house. ''If you are serious about drums here,'' he said, ''you pretty much have to get a rehearsal studio.''
The couple signed a one-year lease on the unfinished apartment, paying a broker's fee of $1,850. They had seen the superintendent's home, and knew theirs would be renovated in a similar style, so they weren't worried. ''I could tell it was going to be great,'' Ms. Ouziel said. ''And I didn't think we would find anything like it.''
They moved in last month, shortly before Mr. Shiffman started classes. They are a bit short on closet and cabinet space, but a trip to Ikea produced a clothes rack and some shelves.
They have less light than they expected, but more heat. ''I am someone who is always freezing,'' Ms. Ouziel said, ''but in this apartment I am always hot. We had to get a lighter comforter.''
Happily, she again feels like a New Yorker. Mr. Shiffman drives to New Jersey several times a week to teach drums, with each round-trip over the George Washington Bridge costing a painful $12.
If he returns late at night, he can't always find a spot on the right side of the street.
''You have to get lucky some nights,'' he said, ''but midday you can always find parking, and weekends you can mostly find parking.''

HEADLINE: Long Trip From Skid Row to the Screen

BYLINE: By ARI KARPEL

 BODY:
THE prospect of adapting for the screen a memoir about writing, addiction and homelessness is fraught with challenges. To start with, there is the subject matter, so well trod as to feel cliched. And when it came to the specifics of Nick Flynn's well-reviewed reminiscence about his own troubles and those of his derelict father, the obstacles piled up: not one but two narrators and a title that wouldn't pass muster with family newspapers, among other issues. Then there were the usual film project travails that involved several studios and visions, not to mention a filmmaker with his own demons.
Paul Weitz, who adapted the book and directed what's now known as ''Being Flynn,'' opening Friday in New York and Los Angeles, had a novel solution to the initial problem: ''I think that the first mistake you can make is to try to make it feel fresh,'' he said. But he went on to explain, ''It's easy to forget that it's individuals going through things, rather than issues.'' 
Luckily Mr. Weitz had one of the individuals in question at his disposal. Nick Flynn had written the source material, ''a potent, distinctive autobiography,'' according to The New York Times Book Review, though it called the book ''Another Bull Night ...'' rather than use the actual, profanity-laced title. ''The M.P.A.A. wouldn't allow that title, and they wouldn't allow asterisks to replace words,'' Mr. Weitz said by phone, referring to the Motion Picture Association of America. ''That was upsetting, and I kind of knew it was coming down the pike. But yeah, I'm stressed about it.''
Amid such stumbling blocks Mr. Weitz, whose work includes the movies ''American Dreamz'' and ''In Good Company,'' as well as the play ''Lonely I'm Not'' (coming soon to Off Broadway), was compelled by the questions raised by Mr. Flynn's story, about a struggling, self-destructive writer (played by Paul Dano) who works in the homeless shelter where his alcoholic father (Robert DeNiro), a man plagued by grandiose notions of his own unfulfilled writing talent, winds up staying. The intriguing themes included ''whether you're fated to become your father, or whether you can become your own person,'' said Mr. Weitz, who also cited the interplay between creativity and egotism.
While the circumstances of his upbringing differ dramatically from those of Mr. Flynn's, Mr. Weitz has struggled with comparable issues. ''My dad was a pretty successful fashion designer,'' he explained, referring to the John Weitz, a men's wear heavyweight, who died in 2002. ''But what he wanted to be in life was a writer, and he was a very loving but fairly tortured fellow. And so I've always wanted to react to that, to try to avoid some of his specific brand of pain, coming from creativity.''
Mr. Weitz said he had battled his own brand, a pain that fed his drive to get ''Being Flynn'' made. ''I felt like I had nothing to lose, because there's ways in which I've let myself down as a filmmaker,'' he said. Unwilling to specify the films he was referring to, Mr. Weitz went on to attribute his self-perceived failings to ''an overestimation of my own ability and clout.''
To hear him speak of the years-long ''Kafkaesque'' process it took to get ''Being Flynn'' made, Mr. Weitz seems to suffer from the opposite, an excess of humility. ''I came to think of it as an exercise that might never come to fruition,'' he said. ''It wasn't difficult to write. It was only difficult to write it well.'' By his count Mr. Weitz did 30 versions of the script. (Mr. Flynn read each one.) ''I'd been telling Nick, 'Bear with me, I'm going to get the movie made,' but I was, at some point, kind of lying to him, because all signs were to the contrary.''
Perhaps more than Mr. Weitz's own limitations, the project suffered from the changing economics of the movie business. Since the book was optioned by Sony Pictures roughly eight years ago, films with grown-up themes have become even more difficult to get made, and budgets for them have sunk to new lows. Hired early on, Mr. Weitz turned out a script appropriate, in his description, for a ''Romanian art-house film.'' Mr. Flynn called that version ''weird and dark and poetic.''
Naturally it did not get a green light from Sony. The film eventually landed at Fox 2000, where it took a turn toward comedy. ''It was like: 'This will be too much for audiences,' or 'They won't get this. Let's make this a little happier,' '' Mr. Flynn said of the studio's notes. ''It's a movie about a homeless street alcoholic, what,'' he used an expletive ''do you want?''
''They just drained the darkness out of it until it became kind of unrecognizable,'' he said.
''Paul was trying to accommodate the studio,'' explained Mr. DeNiro, who came on board at that point, drawn by what he called Mr. Weitz's ''special feelings'' for the material. Eventually the project made its way to Focus Features, but production on ''Little Fockers,'' starring Mr. DeNiro and directed by Mr. Weitz, delayed it. ''I made it clear to Paul that if he does 'Little Fockers' or not, we'd still do this movie,'' Mr. DeNiro recalled. (That film was released in 2010.)
At last ''Being Flynn'' received the go-ahead at Focus, which had no problem with the dark material, reinstating Mr. Weitz's ''Romanian art-house'' script, but it had to be shot for about $8 million, according to a person close to the production who was not authorized to speak to the press.
At that point the challenge became making it all work on screen. To portray the writing process of both main characters Mr. Weitz chose a risky device: double narration. ''My brother and I did that on 'About a Boy,' '' he said, referring to Chris Weitz, his fellow writer and director on that 2002 film, which starred Hugh Grant. ''I think the key is that they be unreliable narrators. If they're literally saying what's going on, then you're in trouble.''
Then there was the issue of homelessness. Though the movie's scenes of Mr. DeNiro's character sleeping on the street in the cold are a stark depiction of a harsh reality, Mr. Weitz worked to focus on the individual. ''I thought it was fascinating that a man with a massive ego ended up becoming homeless,'' he said.
Mr. DeNiro added, ''There's no sentiment about being homeless, it's just the way he existed.''
The portrayal of addiction came with a similar mandate. ''It was important to us not to glorify those circumstances,'' Mr. Dano said. ''The thing that was most fascinating to me in the research process was realizing how ordinary it is, how easy it is'' to become an addict.
At its core ''Being Flynn'' is less about addiction than self-hatred and ego, two matters suggested by the memoir's original title as well as its on-screen one. ''To have your name on a title seems like a gross act of egotism,'' the author said. Still, Mr. Flynn, who was on the set every day, acknowledged the bizarre experience of reliving his life by witnessing actors recreate it. ''It's one thing to go through it, but to watch someone have 20 takes at it is a whole different thing,'' he said, adding that he took to joking about it. ''After the 20th take I'd say to Paul Dano: 'I got it right the first time, every time. So why is it taking you 20 times to get it?' ''
Though, Mr. Flynn said, by the time the shoot was done, Mr. Dano would land scenes in one take. ''He became a better me by the end.''

HEADLINE: Nascar Remains Low on Its Main Fuel

BYLINE: By VIV BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- When the charismatic Trevor Bayne won the prestigious Daytona 500 last year as a 20-year-old part-time driver in his second Nascar Sprint Cup start, it could have been a turning point for a sport eager to draw young fans.
Drivers like Bayne are Nascar's future. But he will have to be patient. No high-profile sponsor has offered Bayne a regular ride in the Cup Series. So a year after his stunning victory, he arrived at Daytona as a part-timer once again. He will start 40th in Sunday's Daytona 500 in the No. 21 Ford. 
''When I won the 500, in the back of my mind, I was thinking I'm set now,'' Bayne said last month. ''We call it a lifer. Once you won a Cup race, you used to be a lifer. But it just shows how tough it is.''
Bayne is the latest victim of a recession that has yet to loosen its grip on a sport that runs on sponsorship dollars. Although some new corporate sponsors have come, many have cut back on their commitments, and others are backing off as contracts expire.
The result is a contraction that goes all the way to the top in Nascar. Roush Fenway Racing, Ford's showcase team that once placed five racecars in the Cup playoff Chase and inspired the Nascar rule limiting teams to four competitors, has three drivers this season. David Ragan, who drove the No. 6 Ford, was out of a ride when United Parcel Service reduced its investment, and Roush Fenway reportedly laid off 100 to 125 employees. The team also reduced its commitment in the Nationwide Series, with the defending series champion, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., running a full schedule and Bayne, whose 2011 season was interrupted by a mysterious illness, without full sponsorship.
''This is the roughest economic depression that we've had,'' the team owner Jack Roush said.
Roush Fenway is not alone. Two seats were lost when Red Bull shuttered its team after last season, leaving Brian Vickers without a ride. (Kasey Kahne had signed with Hendrick Motorsports.) Richard Childress Racing also dropped to three cars when General Mills cut back its sponsorship, costing Clint Bowyer, a five-time race winner and three-time season-ending playoff participant, his seat in the No. 33 Chevrolet. Hendrick is the only four-car team left in Sprint Cup.
''It's definitely the worst I've ever seen,'' Bowyer said. ''It's very tough. It's a sponsor-driven sport; it always has been ever since the first day I came into this and kind of learned the ropes. Man, it's tough everywhere.''
Bowyer secured his own sponsorship with 5-hour Energy and signed with midlevel Michael Waltrip Racing. Driver moves are typical from year to year. But this off-season turned into an almost desperate game of musical chairs as drivers scrambled to find new rides with options limited.
''Never seen this kind of shrinkage before, because it never got so big before,'' said the veteran driver Mark Martin, who will race part time for Waltrip this season.
He added: ''Until the euphoric time through the late '90s and from 2000 to whatever, '07, '08, it was more like it is now. So it's not alarming to me other than everyone tends to get comfortable and used to a certain way, and now it's much tougher and things have thinned out and opportunities are tougher and you have to work a lot harder for less. Everybody does.''
Not only are there fewer top teams this season, but they also have less support. Asked about the $20 million to $25 million sponsorships thought to be common a few years ago, the team owner Roger Penske said ''a good full-time sponsorship'' today is $12 million to $13 million.
Penske has attracted new sponsorship, as have a number of teams, but mostly in smaller amounts. Roush Fenway is struggling to find full sponsorship for Matt Kenseth, the 2003 Cup champion.
If Nascar is concerned about contraction, Brian France, its chairman, is not saying.
''Well, the economy will do that,'' he said. ''It will have an effect on the sponsorship model, the funding of the teams and various reasons teams also move around or get smaller.''
The worry about having races with fewer than 43 cars appears to have passed. Michael Waltrip Racing expanded with Bowyer, and Ragan has found a ride with Front Row Motorsports. It is one of several smaller teams that perhaps could not have entered the sport at its height in the mid-2000s, but saw an opening as others have left. The latest newcomer is BK Racing, which is taking over the old Red Bull team with the drivers David Reutimann and Landon Cassill.
The new teams are not financed at the same level as the top teams, though. And that will reduce the number of competitive rides.
In addition, the back of the field is increasingly being filled with so-called start-and-park racecars. They are in the starting lineups but do not finish, stopping after a certain number of laps to save the equipment for the next race. Many see this as an opening for new owners who could eventually develop competitive teams. But when the economy improves for Nascar, some of those teams will probably be replaced by megateams that have been waiting for a chance to expand.
''I think America is scared; I think the corporations are scared to make big investments,'' said Jeff Burton, who drives for Richard Childress Racing. ''I will say this: The number of sponsors we have in this sport is acceptable. We have more sponsors today spending less money on the sport. But those same sponsors are spending less money on everything they do. So the fact that they still want to be part of the sport is very encouraging.''
Roush also seems hopeful. He plans to have a four-car team again, perhaps next season. Either Bayne or Stenhouse, who is driving the No. 6 in the Daytona 500, will be in line for that full-time ride.
It cannot happen soon enough for Bayne, who earned his shot a year ago.
''I have time to get there,'' Bayne said. ''I want to be up there battling with the best.''

HEADLINE: A Vietnamese Standby, Where Veggies Are King

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE LYNESS

 BODY:
VIETNAMESE cuisine has been making its way into the American restaurant scene for a couple of decades. But in Connecticut it remains far less represented than Thai food, with which it shares many ingredients. So it was a pleasure to visit Saigon City in Old Saybrook, where a wood-burning fireplace in the dining room offers the appropriate midwinter atmosphere for New England diners and where the appealing Vietnamese and Thai dishes that gained good reviews for the restaurant more than a decade ago continue to be served at prices that barely account for inflation.
Saigon City is owned by Vu Nguyen and his wife, Bernadette, both of Vietnamese descent. The restaurant opened in New Haven in 1986 and moved to Old Saybrook 10 years later. Mr. Nguyen does all the cooking; his wife runs the front of the house. 
One of the joys of Vietnamese cuisine, which is generally less spicy than Thai food, is the abundant use of greens and fresh herbs. Appetizers and grilled meats and seafood are eaten wrapped in lettuce with herbs and sliced vegetables, and the meal practically always includes a salad platter of soft lettuces mixed with other vegetables and herbs, like coriander, cucumbers, mint, basil, scallions and bean sprouts. With a nod to that tradition, most of the dishes at Saigon City were attractively presented on a bed of lettuce with sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, house-pickled vegetables and fresh herbs (coriander was missing one night, but upon request our waitress brought us a small bowl of it).
On the evenings I ate there, many of the best dishes were the salads. Most were hefty enough to work as a main course. A spicy Thai squid salad featured bite-size pieces of squid, scored and steamed. Appropriately tender, the squid was served on one of the ubiquitous heaps of vegetables and sprinkled with rice powder; the spicy sauce tasted of lemon, lime, lemongrass and chile paste. A Thai beef salad was also served with a mix of greens and vegetables and a similar but more assertive dressing; it suffered in comparison with other beef salads I've tasted in that the beef had been broiled, rather than grilled, and lacked the traditional charred flavor. The Vietnamese special salad combined shrimp with slices of chicken breast and chopped peanuts on an array of vegetables tossed with a milder dressing of fish sauce with sugar and lemon.
For appetizers, battered Thai chicken wings were nicely crisp, as were Vietnamese spring rolls. The spring rolls enclosed rice vermicelli and a well-seasoned pork mixture; they were especially good folded into pieces of lettuce and dipped in the omnipresent nuac cham, a sweet, chile-spiked condiment based on Vietnamese fish sauce.
Summer rolls -- shrimp, chicken and rice vermicelli wrapped in rice paper -- were straightforward but would have been improved with more herbs. Skewered pork was a bit overcooked, but its honey marinade, with garlic and lemongrass, gave it a nice flavor. A bowl of pho, Vietnam's classic beef-noodle soup, was warming and pleasant but not as meaty-tasting as some of the best.
Some entrees had a fine home-cooked flavor but were nothing out of the ordinary, like the squid saute, which was prepared with a medley of vegetables in a sweet hoisin-like sauce. A plate of barbecue beef bun -- broiled strips of flank steak served on a bed of lettuce with rice noodles, herbs, vegetables, peanuts and a sweet sauce -- was fresh but bland (the requested bowl of fresh coriander helped). And the rice-batter pancake, filled with shrimp, mushrooms and bean sprouts, was not as crisp as others I've eaten.
The roast duck, however, was terrific. In a phone conversation after my visits, Mr. Nguyen explained that the duck is marinated overnight in a mixture of five-spice powder, coriander, ginger and soy sauce, then roasted and grilled to order. The result is flavorful, tender meat cloaked in very crisp skin. A Thai green-curry chicken with coconut and vegetables was also delicious, as was a dish of ''shaking tofu.'' The cubed tofu is first deep-fried to firm it, Mr. Nguyen said, then wok-sauteed (thus the ''shaking'') in a mixture of soy sauce and ginger that creates a delicious flavor and a well-caramelized exterior.
For dessert, a warm banana cake, made with sticky rice and served with sweetened coconut sauce, was a lovely surprise. The rice was first simmered with coconut juice until soft, then combined with pieces of fried banana, wrapped in banana leaf and steamed; the result of this twice-cooking was a very smooth mixture delicately infused with the flavor of banana. Other offerings -- sticky rice with mango, flan made with coconut milk, and ginger and green tea ice creams -- were less intriguing but finished the meal nicely.

HEADLINE: Stepping Out With Style And Batteries

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- MOVIE critics are always a bit suspicious when they aren't allowed to preview a film until it's already in theaters. Does the studio know that it has made a stinker, and fears that bad reviews will warn the public away?
I felt similar trepidation when an invitation finally arrived to drive the Fisker Karma. After all, this luxurious plug-in hybrid -- like the Chevrolet Volt, it is electrically driven, with a gasoline engine that extends the range of its battery pack -- has been on sale since summer, with cars delivered to customers in December. What took Fisker Automotive so long to show off its pretty baby?
The road to market proved bumpy, with the Karma arriving two years later than promised with a base price ($103,000) some $20,000 over the original estimate. Along the way, Fisker got a $169 million start-up loan from the federal government for the car, which is assembled in Finland.
Another disappointment was the rather dismal fuel-economy rating of 20 m.p.g., on premium fuel, when the internal-combustion engine is engaged. 
But none of that seemed relevant when I was finally able to drive the Karma, unsupervised, on a recent bright afternoon here.
Admittedly, I was at the wheel only long enough for initial impressions -- not the usual weeklong test drive -- but I was able to do whatever I wished. Alas, I had no chance to flaunt Hollywood's latest environmental status symbol by pulling up to the red carpet at the Oscars.
At first sight, the Karma seems a concept car come to life -- and, in fact, it is. Little of the design has changed since it was unveiled at the 2008 Detroit auto show. This includes its low-set body, its voluptuous curves and even its huge 22-inch wheels and tires. Those caused a bit of consternation for designers of the distinctive, intricate double-wishbone suspension, but any problems they encountered seem to have been solved.
As a former designer of BMWs and Aston Martins, Henrik Fisker objects to bold design studies that are watered down for production. ''I also believe hybrids don't have to be boring,'' Mr. Fisker said in an earlier interview. ''Or ugly.''
Like the similarly sized Aston Martin Rapide and Porsche Panamera, the Karma is a fastback sedan masquerading as a coupe. It's a handsome disguise, though with its handlebar-mustache grille it comes off as one-fourth of a barbershop quartet. My drive was delayed over and over as passers-by volunteered praise for its rakish style.
The interior is appealing as well, but low-key. The minimalist treatment is largely free of the usual array of buttons, switches and dials; those functions are mostly consigned to a 10.5-inch touch-screen that looks like a complex Etch A Sketch.
Paddles on either side of the steering wheel engage two driving modes: thrifty Stealth or rowdy Sport, which provides an assist from the gas-driven generator. Two ''hill'' settings increase the degree of regenerative braking when you ease off the accelerator. The gearshift is a small cone-shaped device on the center console.
The driving position is comfortable, but the seats are snug even for adults of average size and weight. The low roofline results in blind spots.
My $116,000 test car had the EcoChic package that includes textile -- not leather -- upholstery and salvaged wood trim. Though the Karma is made for the slim, the car could stand a diet; at 5,600 pounds, it weighs nearly as much as the mammoth Rolls-Royce Phantom. Despite its aluminum components, the Karma carries the weight of batteries, electric motors and a gas generator.
Although Fisker says the Karma's performance was benchmarked against comparable grand-touring sedans, it is not an electrifying performer. In battery-only Stealth mode, it accelerates to 60 m.p.h. in 7.9 seconds, on par with a Honda Odyssey minivan. The top speed in that mode is 95 m.p.h.
For a jolt of performance there is Sport mode, when the output of the 600-pound, 22-kilowatt-hour battery pack is supplemented by a 2-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine from General Motors. In Sport, the car reaches 60 m.p.h. in about 6 seconds, right up there with a Volkswagen Golf GTI.
Running on either battery or generator power, the Karma is driven electrically by a pair of motor-generators between the rear tires; they deliver a little over 400 horsepower to the single-speed limited-slip rear differential. Torque is stated to be nearly 1,000 pound-feet -- a rather stunning figure -- all available as soon as the car starts moving.
When I started my brief drive, the electric range was shown to be 48 miles (the E.P.A. rates actual electric range at 32 miles), with 286 miles for the potential combined electric-gasoline range.
In three hours behind the wheel, I never fully depleted the battery. And while I covered 34 miles, the meters showed I'd used up 40 miles of range.
The E.P.A. estimates the gasoline-equivalent mileage when running on electricity is 52 m.p.g.e. But like the Volt, if your daily drive is less than 40 miles or so, and you don't engage the gas engine's assist before recharging, you may use no fossil fuel at all. It takes about six hours on a 220-volt charger to replenish the depleted battery pack.
The gas engine never drives the wheels. When it is running, it acts solely as a generator to maintain the battery pack's state of charge. While the engine could theoretically recharge the batteries, it was not designed to do so, Mr. Fisker said, as that would increase the car's emissions. As it is, the Karma carries an unimpressive ''ultra low'' emissions rating, not the partial zero-emissions rating of many conventional cars.
Although engaging the gas engine is easy enough, I seldom felt the need. Though not necessarily nimble or light on its feet, the Karma has very responsive steering and solid grip. The turning radius is rather large, but the car carves a smart line through sinuous twists and turns. The Karma is eerily quiet, even when the gas engine kicks in. At low speeds, the car emits a low-frequency sci-fi noise as a pedestrian warning.
We ran some errands around town, parallel-parked at a strip mall, loaded sacks of groceries and drove down a dirt road to a farm stand.
We picked up and left off passengers, toured neighborhoods at low speeds; sped onto freeways and endured stop-and-go traffic. We detoured through the mountains and along curving country roads. The Karma performed competently, and it looked good all the while.
So a starlet is born. My date with the Fisker was an entertaining sneak preview that left me eager for a full-length performance. Let's hold the curtain call till then.

HEADLINE: Hey, Actos: Accountants Have Dreams, too!

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is a co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
In their book ''Freakonomics,'' Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt explain, among other things, the odd economic behavior that guides many drug dealers. In one gang they described, the typical street-corner guy made less than minimum wage but still worked extremely hard in hopes of some day becoming one of the few wildly rich kingpins. This behavior isn't isolated to illegal activity. There are a number of professions in which workers are paid, in part, with a figurative lottery ticket. The worker accepts a lower-paying job in exchange for a slim but real chance of a large, future payday.
This more or less explains Hollywood. Yes, the Oscars may be an absurd spectacle of remarkably successful people congratulating themselves for work that barely nudges at the borders of meaningful human achievement. But it's also a celebration of a form of meritocratic capitalism. I'm not talking about the fortunes lavished on extremely good looking people; no, I mean the economic system that compels lots of young people to work extremely hard for little pay so that it's possible to lavish fortune on the good-looking people. That's the spirit of meritocratic capitalism! 
Hollywood is, in some ways, the model lottery industry. For most companies in the business, it doesn't make economic sense to, as Google does, put promising young applicants through a series of tests and then hire only the small number who pass. Instead, it's cheaper for talent agencies and studios to hire a lot of young workers and run them through a few years of low-paying drudgery. (Actors are another story altogether. Many never get steady jobs in the first place.) This occupational centrifuge allows workers to effectively sort themselves out based on skill and drive. Over time, some will lose their commitment; others will realize that they don't have the right talent set; others will find that they're better at something else.
When it's time to choose who gets the top job or becomes partner, managers subsequently have a lot more information to work with. In the meantime, companies also get the benefit of several years of hard work from determined young people at below-market pay. (Warner Brothers pays its mailroom clerks $25,000 to $30,000, a little more than an apprentice plumber.) While far from perfect, this strategy has done a pretty decent job of pushing those with real promise to the top. Barry Diller and David Geffen each started his career in the William Morris mailroom.
Hollywood is merely the most glamorous industry that puts new entrants -- whether they're in the mailroom, picking up dry cleaning for a studio head or waiting on tables between open-call auditions -- through a lottery system. Even glamour-free industries offer economic-lottery systems. Young, ambitious accountants who toil away at a Big Four firm may have modest expectations of glory, but they'll be millionaires if they make partner. The same goes at law firms, ad agencies and consulting firms. Startups explicitly use a lottery system, known as stock options, to entice young people to work for nothing. Wall Street, however, is a special case. It offers extremely high entry salaries and enormous potential earnings.
Even professions that can't offer as much in the way of riches operate as a lottery system. Academia, nonprofit groups, book publishers and public-radio production companies also put their new recruits through various forms of low-paid hazing, holding out the promise of, well, more low pay but in a job that provides, for some, something more important than money: satisfaction. In the language of economics, these people are consuming their potential wages in happiness. (Honestly, economists talk this way.)
This system is unfair and arbitrary and often takes advantage of many people who don't really have a shot at the big prize. But it is far preferable to the parts of our economy where there are no big prizes waiting. That mailroom clerk at Warner Brothers may make less than a post office clerk (maybe even half as much), but the latter has less chance of a significant promotion. Workers in retail sales, clerical settings, low-skill manufacturing and other fields tend to have loose, uncommitted bonds to their industries, and their employers have even looser commitments to them. These jobs don't offer a bright future precisely because they don't require a huge amount of skill, and therefore there's no need to do much merit-sorting.
But part of the American post-World War II economic miracle was that most people didn't have to choose between a high-stakes-lottery job or a lousy dead-end one. Steelworkers, midlevel corporate executives, shopkeepers and plumbers were all able to make a decent amount from the start of their careers with steady, but never spectacular, raises throughout. These two tiers actually supported each other. Strivers were able to dream bigger because they had a solid Plan B. New York City and Los Angeles are buoyed by teachers, store owners, arts administrators and others who came to town to make it big in film or music or publishing, eventually gave up on that dream and ended up doing fine in another field.
Now, many economists fear that the comfortable Plan B jobs are disappearing. Technology and cheaper goods from overseas have replaced many of the not-especially-creative professions. A tax accountant loses clients to TurboTax; many graphic designers have been replaced by Photoshop; and the small shopkeeper by Home Depot, Walmart or Duane Reade. Though a lottery economy is valuable to various industries, the thought of an entire lottery-based economy, in which a few people win big while the rest are forced to toil in an uncertain and not terribly remunerative dead-end labor pool, is unfair and politically scary. If large numbers of people believe they have no shot at a better life in the future, they will work less hard and generate fewer new ideas and businesses. The economy, as a whole, will be poorer.
It's not clear what today's eager 23-year-old will do in 5 or 10 years when she decides that acting (or that accounting partnership) isn't going to work out after all. The best advice may be to accept that economic success in America will come as much from the labor lottery as from hard work and tenacity. The Oscars make clear that there is only so much room at the top. In a lottery-based economy, you need some luck, too; now, perhaps, more than ever. People should be prepared to enter a few different lotteries, because the new Plan B is just going to be another long shot in a different field. The role model of our time should be an actress who was never nominated for an Oscar. Hedy Lamarr did well enough on the screen but, just in case, she spent her free time developing something called frequency-hopping spread-spectrum. It's a wireless-communication technique still in use in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Not bad for a fallback.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. Hollywood is the most glamorous lottery-style business in the U.S. economy.
2. It's hardly the only one.
3. But now the Plan B jobs are evaporating.

HEADLINE: Tables Have Turned for Corporate Earnings and Stocks

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine.

 BODY:
A YEAR ago, when the United States economy looked stuck in the mud, stocks received a much-needed push from stronger-than-expected corporate earnings.
Indeed, while the economy expanded by just four-tenths of 1 percent at the start of last year, stocks still managed to gain ground in the first quarter -- largely because of a 20 percent surge in profits among companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
This year, though, the tables have turned. It's the economy that appears to be gaining traction. The unemployment rate, for instance, has fallen faster than expected, and consumer borrowing has rebounded much more rapidly than many economists had thought it would. Yet corporate profits have begun to sputter. 
Earnings for the S.& P. 500 are predicted to climb just 6 percent this year, down from 16 percent in 2011, according to S.& P. Capital IQ. And even that may be too optimistic, some market strategists say.
The slowdown has already begun, as profits grew just 8 percent in the fourth quarter last year, versus the same period in 2010. That's the slowest growth rate ''since the recovery in earnings began over two years ago,'' said Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.
So is this year's rally suddenly in jeopardy?
Not necessarily. Yes, it's true that over the long run, corporate profits are a major driver of stock market performance. But there is virtually no correlation between earnings growth and stock price movements in any single calendar year, said Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer at the Leuthold Group.
Mr. Ramsey has studied market performance going back to 1938, and has discovered that in the 16 best years for stocks, eight actually coincided with declines in corporate earnings. And profits rose in 13 of the 16 worst years for stocks.
It just goes to show that earnings aren't a predictor of stock performance; it's the other way around. The equity market is a forward-looking gauge of the health of the economy, which in turn affects profits.
So don't assume that this year's rally must be threatened by weaker-than-expected earnings. Instead, it may simply be foreshadowing a profit rebound in 2013, just as last year's flat stock market predicted this year's modest profit outlook.
For the record, Mr. Ramsey says he believes that S.& P. 500 profits will decline this year, versus 2011. Yet he thinks domestic and foreign stocks are likely to produce double-digit gains.
Jason Hsu, chief investment officer at the investment consulting firm Research Affiliates, says that this ''is a classic case of the dichotomy between the health of the economy and the health of corporate earnings.''
So just as they did last year, investors face two conflicting trends.
''It's hard to say which one is ultimately going to dominate,'' Mr. Hsu says. But, he notes, investors understand that earnings are cyclical and that profit growth had to slow eventually.
On the other hand, there has been better-than-expected news about the domestic economy, coupled with signs of improvement from Europe. So in the short run, he says, the markets are likely to react to the economy.
''As long as improvements to the economy and the European crisis dominate the headlines, I think the earnings slowdown is going to be somewhat of a nonissue for the time being,'' he said.
Mark R. Freeman, chief investment officer at the Westwood Holdings Group, an asset management firm, says investor confidence will really be put to the test when first-quarter earnings reports start rolling in this spring.
Right now, first-quarter 2012 profits are expected to grow barely 1 percent versus the same period in 2011, according to S.& P. Capital IQ. But if earnings don't at least meet those modest expectations, and instead decline, investors might rethink their newfound confidence in the economy, he says.
OF course, he adds, one other factor must be taken into account.
In an environment of low interest rates, when the bond market is offering record-low yields, investors have begun to look to other asset classes as potential sources of income.
''The equity market isn't just promising decent dividend income, but also the ability to grow that income in the future,'' Mr. Freeman says. ''The irony of ironies is that it may not be earnings growth that props up stock prices like last year. It may be income.''

HEADLINE: Families Stake a Claim To Long Island City

BYLINE: By ANTHONIA AKITUNDE

 BODY:
THE third wave of gentrification is just now being felt in Long Island City, Queens. Artists and other creative types colonized the area's warehouses several decades ago, followed by a burst of high-rise development aimed at singles and couples who wanted a lower-cost alternative to Manhattan.
Now apartments that can accommodate families are in demand, and buildings on the drawing board or under construction will have playrooms as amenities, along with gyms and rooftop spaces, area brokers say. 
''We're just seeing the infancy, no pun intended,'' said David J. Maundrell, the president of brokerage firm aptsandlofts.com, which has many listings in the area. ''By the time the child is ready for preschool, there will be many options for them, and they can grow and stay in the community for 10 years.''
Families living in Long Island City now laud the neighborhood's new waterfront parks, its relative affordability and a congenial sense of community that, they say, makes the area feel like a suburban extension of New York City.
But Long Island City's location remains a chief draw. ''The fact that we both work in the city was a key reason we moved to L.I.C.,'' said Jackie Freund, a mother of two who came to the neighborhood eight years ago when she and her husband, Lee, began thinking about having children. ''We didn't want to commute over 45 minutes each way and lose precious time with our family.''
A short commute is also attractive for parents who want to keep their children enrolled in Manhattan or Brooklyn schools.
In the first quarter of last year, said Jonathan J. Miller of the appraisal company Miller Samuel, the average size of units sold was 822 square feet. In the fourth quarter it was 1,364 square feet. Mr. Miller cautioned against seeing the figure as a long-term trend, but Eric Benaim, the president of the brokerage firm Modern Spaces NYC, said about 40 percent of his clients were seeking two-bedroom or larger units. ''In most of those cases,'' he said, ''they are families.''
Among the new buildings, the 122-unit L Haus, at 11-02 49th Avenue, offers three-bedroom condos as big as 1,800 square feet, along with a 10,000-square-foot yard; it is over 60 percent sold. A 157-unit rental complex at 17-19 27th Street, scheduled to open later this year, will have a playroom.
With few three-bedroom apartments available to rent, two-bedrooms are in high demand. According to market reports from the brokerage MNS, two-bedrooms saw the largest rent increases in Long Island City over the last two years.
Parents say the area still lacks conveniences geared toward families. The 7 subway line can be finicky, they say, and Food Cellar & Co., the area's main grocery, is more a high-end than a day-to-day kind of store.
''We need more services,'' said Catalina Villamizar, who moved to the area from Midtown when she became pregnant with her now 3-year-old son. ''More day care, places to get a kid's haircut, doctors, all that kind of stuff.''
Anticipating growth, public and private schools are expanding. Public School 78Q plans a new facility for kindergarten through Grade 5, and Les Enfants Montessori School in Long Island City has expanded its space to accommodate 100 more students. There are also plans for a new high school, and a 22,000-square-foot waterfront library is scheduled to open in 2013.
Ilana Angeliades, the director of Lolly's Learning Center, a preschool for 2- to 5-year-olds, says that her program is at full capacity, and that parents have even taken to calling before their children are born. In December, in response to a demand for infant care, Ms. Angeliades and Natasha Parmar opened Brighter Babies, for children as young as 3 months old.
Yet despite the presence of more strollers on the streets and expectant mothers in restaurants, Long Island City is no Park Slope, said Dan Miner, the senior vice president of the Long Island City Partnership, an economic development group.
''Park Slope has been a mature residential neighborhood for 100 years,'' Mr. Miner said. ''Long Island City is progressing along at its own course.''

HEADLINE: Overwhelmed, And Prone to Procrastinate

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
SINCE time began, it seems, people have been putting off till tomorrow what they could have done today -- berating themselves and inconveniencing others in the process.
It wouldn't be a problem except that time eventually runs out. ''You may delay, but time will not,'' said Benjamin Franklin.
In the world of work, procrastination has ''expensive and visible costs,'' said Rory Vaden, a corporate trainer, who points to research showing that the average employee admits to wasting two hours a day on nonwork tasks. 
People know that procrastination hurts themselves, others and their work, so why do they do it? One answer, especially in these times, is that they are overwhelmed, said Julie Morgenstern, a productivity consultant in New York and author of ''Time Management From the Inside Out.''
Since the recession, work teams have shrunk and workloads and pressures have grown, she said. Companies are asking their workers to be more innovative and creative -- and at the same time more efficient. It's a recipe for paralysis.
Technology like e-mail, Facebook and Twitter, meanwhile, offers more avenues for distraction. Answering a trivial e-mail or attending to other minutiae can provide a momentary sense of accomplishment, or a ''quick win,'' Ms. Morgenstern said.
Often, procrastinators are ''extremely concerned about what other people think of them,'' said Joseph R. Ferrari, a psychology professor at DePaul University and author of ''Still Procrastinating? The No Regrets Guide to Getting It Done.''
These people would rather be accused of lacking effort than lacking ability; the idea is: ''If I never finish, I can never be judged,'' he said. And there can be a fear of success, too: ''If I do well, you might expect more from me next time, and I don't know if I can come through,'' he said.
An accomplice of procrastination is perfectionism. Waiting until the last minute gives perfectionists the perfect excuse: they just didn't have enough time, Ms. Morgenstern said. Perfectionists often tend to need the pressure of the deadline to force themselves to finish.
''The most productive people tend to focus on progress over perfection,'' said Mr. Vaden, author of ''Take the Stairs: 7 Steps to Achieving True Success.'' Remember, he said: ''Success is messy.''
Procrastination often emerges in connection with long-term projects, said Chrisoula Andreou, associate philosophy professor at the University of Utah and co-editor of ''The Thief of Time: Philosophical Essays on Procrastination.''
You can tell yourself that putting off one step in a long process is merely a deviation, and ''each deviation in itself seems negligible,'' but eventually this behavior becomes the rule rather than the exception and the work is never finished, she said.
Find a way to ''invest a symbolic significance in each small step'' you take during a long project, Professor Andreou suggested. This could involve rewarding yourself with a dinner or a massage, for example, when you achieve an incremental goal.
You can also try to ''alter your environment in a way that discourages procrastination,'' she said. Software is available to make the Internet inaccessible at certain times, for example.
People who procrastinate are often plagued by guilt, Ms. Morgenstern said, but beating yourself up is not a solution. Instead, identify the specific areas where you are procrastinating -- say, writing, business development, networking or management duties -- and map out the steps required to achieve your goal.
The new world of work, with its inevitable interruptions, ''requires the skill of breaking large projects into small, completable steps that are anywhere from half an hour to two hours -- three hours tops,'' she said. And if you aren't sure what the next steps are, she said, don't be afraid to ask someone for help.
TIME management techniques may work for some people, but they will probably be ineffective for the 20 percent of people who are chronic procrastinators, Professor Ferrari said. These people tend to put things off at home, at work, in relationships -- in all areas of their lives, and they are experts at coming up with plausible excuses each time they are late, he said.
''To tell the chronic procrastinator 'Just do it,' would be like saying to a clinically depressed person, 'Cheer up,' '' he said.
For these chronic ''procs,'' as he calls them, sessions with a psychologist who focuses on cognitive behavior therapy may be the only path to bringing their time -- and their lives -- under control, he said.

TESTED 2012 Nissan Murano SL
WHAT IS IT? Midsize crossover with two rows of seats.
HOW MUCH? Base S starts at $30,365 with front-wheel drive. SL as tested was $41,280 with all-wheel drive, cargo mat and navigation package.
WHAT MAKES IT RUN? 3.5 liter V-6 with a continuously variable automatic transmission. 
IS IT THIRSTY? Somewhat, as are some other vehicles in its class. The federal mileage estimate is 18 m.p.g. in town and 23 on the highway with all-wheel drive; the rating for front-drive versions isn't much better at 18/24 m.p.g.
ALTERNATIVESFord Edge, $28,350; Hyundai Santa Fe V-6, $25,950; Mazda CX-7 s Touring, $27,250; Toyota Venza LE V-6, $30,125.
THE drive from New Hampshire to Montpelier, Vt., on U.S. Highway 302 can be challenging. The road twists and turns, and the pavement is rough and rumpled, making it a perfect testbed for judging how well the Nissan Murano has held up since the second-generation crossover was introduced three years ago as a 2009 model.
Last year the Murano received some cosmetic upgrades, including a new grille, bumper and taillights, and some interior refinements. There have been no significant mechanical changes.
The Murano rides on the company's ''D'' platform, which also underpins the Altima midsize sedan. With the Murano, Nissan has struck a nice balance between a smooth ride and responsive handling, a crucial compromise that has tripped up many an automaker. The bias here is toward comfort, but I suspect that most drivers will find the Murano's driving dynamics perfectly acceptable.
The power comes from a version of Nissan's familiar, and much praised, VQ V-6, rated at 260 horsepower and 240 pound-feet of peak torque. The engine responds smartly pretty much whenever you want it, thanks partly to one of the best continuously variable transmissions from any automaker. The only downside is a droning sound around 2,000 r.p.m. under a very light throttle.
The interior looked good with beige leather seats and heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, an appreciated feature on a chilly New England day. The front seats are heated, of course, and toasted rear seats are available on the fancy LE.
Controls for the radio, heating and air-conditioning systems are user-friendly and generally intuitive, with large knobs. The dual sunroof is a nice touch, admitting a lot of light on a gray day, although the one in the back doesn't open.
With eight-way power adjustments and a power lumbar support, the driver's seat was comfortable throughout a daylong drive. My front-seat passenger, however, complained about his seat, which lacked the lumbar control and had only four-way power adjustments. The split, flat-folding back seat on the test car had a power return feature; pushing a button in the cargo area returns the folded seatbacks to an upright position.
The test vehicle, at more than $40,000, was rather costly. But Mike Drongowski, Nissan's senior manager for product planning, said the Murano was competing with luxury models like the Lexus RX 350 and the Acura MDX. Among nonluxury brands the Ford Edge has turned out to be a main competitor.
The Murano is surprisingly thirsty for a vehicle with a continuously variable transmission, given that one advantage of that type of gearbox is its infinite number of gear ratios, which let the engine run at close to optimal speeds for better fuel economy. The all-wheel-drive version of the Hyundai Santa Fe, which weighs about the same, is rated 2 m.p.g. better in town and 3 higher on the highway.
The shortcoming has not escaped Nissan.
''We recognize we need to do a better job of improving our fuel economy, and you'll certainly see that in a new generation,'' Mr. Drongowski said.
Nissan has not announced when it will bring out the next Murano, but given the typical five- to six-year life cycle of Nissan models, the next all-new version may arrive in 2014 or 2015.
Fuel economy aside, the Murano has held up remarkably well against new competitors. And an all-wheel-drive model with fewer frills can be had, dealer inventories permitting, for around $32,000. Such a vehicle would offer the same ride, handling and practicality and would represent, I think, a rather good deal.

HEADLINE: A Good Question

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
AN e-mail came in the other day with a subject line that I couldn't ignore. It was from the oil economist Phil Verleger, and it read: ''Should the United States join OPEC?'' That I had to open.
Verleger's basic message was that the knee-jerk debate we're again having over who is responsible for higher oil prices fundamentally misses huge changes that have taken place in America's energy output, making us again a major oil and gas producer -- and potential exporter -- with an interest in reasonably high but stable oil prices. 
From one direction, he says, we're seeing the impact of the ethanol mandate put in place by President George W. Bush, which established fixed quantities of biofuels to be used in gasoline. When this is combined with improved vehicle fuel economy -- in July, the auto industry agreed to achieve fleet averages of more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025 -- it will inevitably drive down demand for gasoline and create more surplus crude to export. Add to that, says Verleger, ''the increase in oil production from offshore fields and unconventional sources in America,'' and that exportable U.S. surplus could grow even bigger.
Then, add the recent discoveries of natural gas deposits all over America, which will allow us to substitute gas for coal at power plants and become a natural gas exporter as well. Put it all together, says Verleger, and you can see why America ''will want to consider joining with other energy-exporting countries, like those in OPEC, to sustain high oil prices. Such an effort would support domestic oil and gas production and give the U.S. a real competitive advantage over countries forced to pay high prices for imported energy -- nations such as China, European Union members, and Japan.''
Indeed, Bloomberg News reported last week that ''the U.S. is the closest it has been in almost 20 years to achieving energy self-sufficiency. ... Domestic oil output is the highest in eight years. The U.S. is producing so much natural gas that, where the government warned four years ago of a critical need to boost imports, it now may approve an export terminal.'' As a result, ''the U.S. has reversed a two-decade-long decline in energy independence, increasing the proportion of demand met from domestic sources over the last six years to an estimated 81 percent through the first 10 months of 2011.'' This transformation could make the U.S. the world's top energy producer by 2020, raise more tax revenue, free us from worrying about the Middle East, and, if we're smart, build a bridge to a much cleaner energy future.
All of this is good news, but it will come true at scale only if these oil and gas resources can be extracted in an environmentally sustainable manner. This can be done right, but we need a deal between environmentalists and the oil and gas industry to lock it in -- now.
Says Hal Harvey, an independent energy expert: ''The oil and gas companies need to decide: Do they want to fight a bloody and painful war of attrition with local communities or take the lead in setting high environmental standards -- particularly for ''fracking,'' the process used to extract all these new natural gas deposits -- ''and then live up to them.''
Higher environmental standards may cost more, but only incrementally, if at all, and they'll make the industry and the environment safer.
In the case of natural gas, we need the highest standards for cleanup of land that is despoiled by gas extraction and to prevent leakage of gas either into aquifers or the atmosphere. Yes, ''generating a kilowatt-hour's worth of electricity with a natural gas turbine emits only about half as much CO2 as from a coal plant,'' says Harvey, and that's great. ''But one molecule of leaked gas contributes as much to global warming as 25 molecules of burned gas. That means that if the system for the exploration, extraction, compression, piping and burning of natural gas leaks by even 2.5 percent, it is as bad as coal.''
Hence, Harvey's five rules for natural gas are: Don't allow leaky systems; use gas to phase out coal; have sound well drilling and casing standards; don't pollute the landscape with brackish or toxic water brought up by fracking; and drill only where it is sensible.
I'd add a sixth rule for crude oil. No one likes higher oil prices. But -- perversely -- the high price benefits America as we rapidly become a bigger oil producer and it ensures that investments will continue to flow into energy efficient cars and trucks. If we were smart, we would establish today a floor price for any barrel of crude oil or gallon of gasoline sold or imported into America -- and tax anything below it. A stable, sufficiently high floor price serves the environment, our technology investments and our energy productivity. As our producers succeed, we would become increasingly energy self-sufficient, keep a lot more dollars at home for our Treasury, stimulate innovation on renewables and drive down the global oil price that is the sole source sustaining Iran and other petro-dictators.
But all of this depends on an understanding between the oil industry and the environmentalists. If President Obama could pull that off, it would be a huge contribution to America's security, economy and environment.

HEADLINE: Yemen Swears In New President to the Sound of Applause, and Violence

BYLINE: By LAURA KASINOF

 BODY:
SANA, Yemen -- Yemen's first new president in more than three decades was sworn in on Saturday, taking over a country with a broken economy, crumbling infrastructure, violent separatist movements, an active Qaeda franchise and Islamist militants in control of large swaths of territory.
After a year of antigovernment protests and rising insecurity in a country the United States sees as a critical ally in the fight against Al Qaeda, Yemenis were hopeful that the new government led by Abed Rabu Mansour Hadi, the former vice president, represented a fresh start.
But as if to underscore the problems Mr. Hadi faces, hours after he took the oath of office and promised to continue the war on Al Qaeda, militants attacked government targets in the southeastern port of Mukalla, killing at least 21 soldiers.
The swearing-in ceremony, in a room in Parliament packed with legislators, diplomats and journalists, was strikingly cheerful. Members of the former ruling party and the opposition, who fought bitterly over the past year, greeted one another with smiles, handshakes and kisses on the cheek. 
When Mr. Hadi entered, the room burst into applause. He took the oath standing between two men who led enemy camps last year, Yahya al-Rayie, the Parliament speaker and a loyalist of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and Himyar al-Ahmar, whose tribesmen fought government forces on the streets of northern Sana.
''I know that there are complex and interlocking crises: economic, social and security,'' Mr. Hadi said afterward.
He called the fight against Al Qaeda ''a national and religious duty.'' And in an indirect reference to his predecessor, the autocratic Mr. Saleh, he urged officials from both sides to work together to ''build a strong state through establishing institutions that are not based on a single personality.''
Mr. Hadi, 65, had been chosen as a consensus candidate by the former ruling party and the opposition, and was confirmed in a one-candidate election on Tuesday. The election was part of a United States-backed deal to end the political crisis and remove Mr. Saleh from office.
Despite the lack of choice, the turnout was heavy, said by the government to be 65 percent, suggesting that after more than a year of protests and unrest in which hundreds were killed, Yemenis were eager to embrace change.
''We consider this a historic day for Yemen,'' said Ali al-Mamari, a legislator who quit Mr. Saleh's party last spring after government supporters used violence against peaceful protesters. ''All year there was a revolution, but now a new revolution started that is without weapons, without conflict, to transform our country into a civil state. I am incredibly happy.''
The challenges remaining, however, are immense.
''This transfer of presidential power is historic for Yemen,'' said April Alley, a regional analyst for the International Crisis Group. ''But it's the days ahead that are going to really matter.
''There are the economic and security challenges that are immediate,'' she said. ''And also there are political challenges when it comes to pulling the country back together, dealing with the separatist movement in the south and a different set of grievances with the Houthis,'' rebels who control Saada Province in the north.
The United States, which sees Yemen largely through the lens of counterterrorism, is expected to be involved in restructuring the military into what it hopes will be a more effective force against Al Qaeda. President Obama's chief counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, raised those concerns in private meetings with Mr. Hadi in Sana last week.
Even the accomplishment being celebrated on Saturday, the end of Mr. Saleh's 33-year rule, was tempered by the reality that he still wields considerable influence. His relatives control most of the military and government security agencies, and it is not known how independent Mr. Hadi, a longtime Saleh loyalist, will be.
Mr. Saleh kept a low profile on Saturday and, despite having promised to hand over power formally to Mr. Hadi, did not attend the ceremony. He had been in the United States for medical treatment for injuries sustained in an attack on his presidential palace last June, and returned to Yemen early Saturday. He ''returned to his private residence in Sana, not the presidential palace,'' said Mohammed Albasha, a spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy in Washington, without elaborating.
Mr. Hadi is charged with leading a transition to democracy, and his new unity government, composed of members of Mr. Saleh's party and the opposition, is to begin a national dialogue on a new constitution. If that effort is to succeed, the government will need to find a way to bring in the separatists in the south and the Houthis in the north.
The south has been discriminated against and marginalized by the Saleh government since north and south Yemen unified in 1990, and many southerners bitterly hate the Sana government. Although Mr. Hadi is from the southern province of Abyan, he fled to Sana in the 1980s and is seen as a traitor by many in the south.
Last spring, a Qaeda-linked militant group called Ansar al-Sharia seized large areas in the south as government forces fled, either defecting or joining the fight against armed opposition fighters in the capital, Sana.
It was not clear if that group was behind the attacks in Mukalla on Saturday. In one case, a suicide car bomb exploded in front of the presidential palace on the outskirts of town. At least 21 soldiers and a civilian, a woman, were killed, the Defense Ministry said. There were also clashes in front of a government security building, residents said.
West of Mukalla, in Aden, there was a gun battle between government forces and armed civilians believed to belong to the southern separatist movement, residents said.
In the capital, however, officials tried to focus on the progress the day symbolized more than the problems that lie ahead. ''This is the beginning of the end of the crisis in Yemen,'' said Sultan al-Barakani, a legislator from Mr. Saleh's party.
The American ambassador, Gerald Feierstein, was among those in attendance. ''This is a victory for all of Yemen,'' he said. ''I think anyone sitting here today knows that real change happened.''
Yemenis also held out hope that whatever comes next must be better than what they have endured for the past year.
Haitham Jarallah, 20, who has known no leader other than Mr. Saleh, was in his father's corner store, near the old city, with a crowd of neighbors, listening to the radio broadcast of Mr. Hadi being sworn into office.
''Always I was with Ali Abdullah Saleh, but now we will stand with Mr. Hadi,'' Mr. Jarallah said. ''A new chapter opened in Yemen's history.''

HEADLINE: Broken Trust In God's Country

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
SUGARCREEK, Ohio
THIS village is as sweet as its name. Main Street climbs gently from a tidy railroad crossing, past a few gift shops to the simple brick First Mennonite Church.
Beyond the hamlet lie the farms and buggy-traveled lanes of the eastern Ohio Amish country, one of the largest clusters of Amish and Mennonite settlements in the nation. Craft markets, furniture shops and restaurants dot the county roads. Those businesses carry the names -- Yoder, Miller, Troyer, Beachy -- that fill entire chapters of the slim local telephone book.
This postcard from a gentler and simpler America is about as unlikely a place imaginable for the news that broke in September: one of Sugarcreek's own, a prominent member of what some people here call the Plain Community, was under arrest, accused by federal prosecutors of running a Ponzi scheme that betrayed his neighbors' trust and wiped out more than $16 million of their savings.
The news media made the obvious comparisons. 
The elderly defendant, Monroe L. Beachy, had been a respected financial figure in his community for decades -- just like Bernard L. Madoff, the master swindler.
As in the Madoff case, Mr. Beachy's seemingly successful investment firm employed several members of his family. He, too, first attracted clients who shared his religious faith. And he, too, was accused of defrauding charities, congregations, even his own relatives. Predictably, headlines have branded Mr. Beachy ''the Amish Bernie Madoff,'' although he is presumed innocent as he heads to trial next month.
But the most intriguing aspect of Monroe Beachy's story is how different it seems from Bernie Madoff's -- and from almost every other story with a ''Ponzi scheme'' headline over the years.
While victims of Mr. Madoff's fraud, like most Ponzi victims, condemned their accused betrayer in court as a monster, many of Mr. Beachy's investors have said in court that it is more important to forgive him than to recover their money.
While the Madoff case and others like it have inevitably created conflict between longtime investors fighting to keep their fictional profits and more recent investors trying to recover lost principal, some Beachy investors urged that their own share of his estate should be given to those in greater need.
And while Mr. Madoff's wife and sons instantly became social pariahs in Manhattan, Mr. Beachy's wife and children remain at his farmstead here, living peacefully with their neighbors.
But like the Madoff case, the Beachy case has left an indelible mark on the nation's bankruptcy record.
It became the forum for a rare bankruptcy court battle over religious freedom, with Mr. Beachy's Amish and Mennonite creditors insisting that the court's way of dealing with his downfall could not be squared with their faith or with his.
''Monroe Beachy in his time of distress breached the trust of his fellow Amish and Mennonites'' by entering an ''environment of coercion and self-protection in the bankruptcy court,'' a group of church elders told the judge, urging him to put the case into the hands of the church where it belonged.
That would accomplish three worthy goals, they said. It would allow a less expensive, more advantageous financial workout ''based on Christian principles of love and care for the poor and needy.'' It would create a setting in which ''Biblical forgiveness and restoration can be found between Monroe Beachy'' and those he is accused of betraying. And it would repair ''the tarnished testimony and integrity of the Plain Community.''
The Beachy name is not only common in Sugarcreek but also notable in the history of the Plain Community, which encompasses a number of Amish and Mennonite sects. One is known as the Beachy Amish, a splinter sect formed in the late 1920s and named for a founding bishop, Moses M. Beachy.
Monroe Beachy, in his late 70s, is married and has five adult children, three sons and two daughters, all living in the Sugarcreek area. He and his wife, Alma, and their daughters live in a tidy home on a 60-acre farm near the muddy verge of Township Road 162, barely wide enough for two cars to pass. The two-story house next door, which he built for his family in 1988, is now a son's home. Monroe Beachy does not drive a car; his only vehicle is a horse-drawn buggy, valued at $3,300, including the horse.
Under oath at a creditor meeting in August 2010, he described his background. He has an eighth-grade education, he said, and attended a few high school classes. As an adult, he took some tax-preparation courses with H & R Block. With an associate, he formed an informal partnership, A & M Investments, in the mid-1980s to operate an H & R Block franchise, but the partnership was dissolved in 2000 and the franchise was sold. Thereafter, Mr. Beachy retained sole control of A & M Investments but also set up his own business, Payrolls & More, which processed paychecks for small businesses.
He was clearly a trusted community figure. He served for 15 years as treasurer of the Amish Helping Fund, a nonprofit that collects money from the Plain Community and uses it to provide mortgages for the purchase of farms and homes in that community. He kept the group's records in a separate fireproof file box at his modest office at 122 West Main Street, across from the First Mennonite Church.
His A & M Investments eventually took in about $33 million, paying investors a fixed return that was better than they could get at the bank. He kept a share of their interest earnings as his fee. He assured those who asked that he invested in only very low-risk government bonds, regulators said in court filings.
In a modest way, Mr. Beachy helped the local economy, making undocumented loans on a handshake to the owners of a bakery and a popular noodle company, who paid him back when they could. He invested cash for dozens of businesses -- a general store, several furniture makers, two concrete companies, an electric supply company and at least one large Amish-style restaurant.
Word spread about his safe, steady returns. Parents encouraged their children to practice thrift by opening A & M accounts, too. By spring 2010, he was mailing his simple one-page, seven-line statements to almost 2,700 investors, largely Amish and Mennonite, in more than two dozen states from Alaska to Arkansas.
THEN, on June 30, 2010, it all came crashing down.
That day, Mr. Beachy abruptly filed for bankruptcy, declaring liabilities of $33.2 million and assets of just $17.9 million. Two of the region's small newspapers reported that there was a note on the door of A & M's darkened office: ''Due to an investigation A & M Investments is closed.''
One of the papers, followed more closely by the Amish community, reported receiving a statement in which Mr. Beachy disclosed the bankruptcy filing and said: ''I deeply regret the concerns caused in our community and the shortfall in A & M's investments. I took this action to ensure that account holders are treated as fairly as possible.''
The first creditor meeting was held that August, in the banquet hall of the Carlisle Inn in nearby Walnut Creek, one of the few places within reach that could accommodate the estimated 600 people who attended.
Under questioning by the bankruptcy trustee, Mr. Beachy explained that some ''bad investments were made'' and had gone sour, wiping out roughly half of his investors' savings. He said these losses were in dot-com stocks and other stocks related to the Internet.
What about his assurances that he invested only in safe government bonds? ''If we misled anyone, we did not do it on purpose,'' he told one investor who questioned him. He said he had relied on recommendations from several advisers, including a broker in New York named Paul Chironis, and had failed to cut losses and seek advice many years ago, when the losses occurred.
The court-appointed bankruptcy trustee, Anne Piero Silagy, pressed Mr. Beachy about when he had decided to file for bankruptcy.
''When the subpoena was issued,'' he said.
When the trustee opened the floor to questions, a man named Ryan Miller asked Mr. Beachy the obvious follow-up question: What subpoena?
''A subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission.''
Mr. Miller persisted. ''For what?''
''To examine the bank accounts,'' Mr. Beachy said.
Lawyers with the Chicago office of the S.E.C. would not disclose what drew their attention to Mr. Beachy or why they served him with the subpoena that prompted his hasty bankruptcy filing. But by September 2010, the government's concerns were emerging in court filings.
Daniel M. McDermott, the Justice Department's United States Trustee for the northern Ohio region, asserted in one document that Mr. Beachy had been insolvent at least since December 2001 and probably as early as 1998, when his handwritten ledger showed his portfolio's market value as $23.6 million, while investors were owed $26.6 million. Mr. Beachy hid these losses from his clients and continued to accept new cash, Mr. McDermott said.
Moreover, the ledgers for two entire years -- from January 1999 to December 2000, a period that included the bursting of the dot-com bubble -- were missing, without explanation, according to Mr. McDermott. Investigators believed A & M Investments had been a Ponzi scheme, he reported.
The portrait of Mr. Beachy's financial career sketched out in a civil lawsuit filed by the S.E.C. last February contrasted sharply with the homespun biography he gave creditors six months earlier.
In July 1987, according to regulators, Mr. Beachy had passed the qualifying exam for a Series 6 securities license from Finra, the securities industry's self-regulatory group. The license entitled him to sell mutual funds and variable annuities. Finra's records show he was licensed through H. D. Vest Investment Services of Irvine, Tex., a national network of independent brokers and tax advisers that was acquired by Wells Fargo in 2001 and sold by the bank last year.
In 1998, according to court records, Mr. Beachy was among a handful of investors who paid $1.8 million to become preferred shareholders in W. J. Nolan & Company, a tiny brokerage firm in New York City. At the time, the firm was already in serious trouble with its regulators, and in October 2001 it closed its doors.
The preferred shareholders sued in state court in New York to recover their investment. In response, the firm sued two of its former brokers, contending that they had been responsible for misleading the preferred shareholders. One of those brokers was Mr. Chironis, the broker Mr. Beachy said had advised him in his disastrous foray into technology stocks.
In a telephone interview last week, Mr. Chironis denied that he had misled the preferred shareholders and said he did not feel that he had any responsibility for the losses Mr. Beachy incurred on those shares, or on any other investment he made over the years. ''He was always in control of his own accounts,'' Mr. Chironis said.
The W. J. Nolan litigation was settled out of court in 2004, the same year Mr. Beachy terminated his Series 6 registration with Finra. But Mr. Beachy did not terminate his relationship with Mr. Chironis, according to regulators. Mr. Beachy said at the creditor meeting in 2010 that not breaking his ties to the broker was ''another mistake'' he regretted.
In April 2010, less than three months before Mr. Beachy received the subpoena, the S.E.C. filed an administrative case accusing Mr. Chironis of defrauding the Sisters of Charity, an order of mostly elderly nuns in the Bronx. In January 2011, he was barred from the securities industry after he settled the S.E.C. case without admitting any wrongdoing and agreed to pay $350,000 to the nuns. Regulators would not say if their interest in Mr. Beachy grew out of the Chironis case.
Mr. Chironis said his dealings with Mr. Beachy went back more than a decade. But the assets Mr. Beachy still owned when he went bankrupt were certainly riskier than the plain-vanilla bonds his clients thought he was buying.
He had invested in various brand-name mutual funds, including one of the T. Rowe Price Spectrum funds, as well as the Pioneer Fund and Fidelity Magellan. He had $1.4 million in one high-yield mutual fund -- also known as a junk bond fund -- and smaller investments in other high-yield funds. And he had $350,000 in a margin account at the New York firm through which he dealt with Mr. Chironis.
Those holdings were at odds with Mr. Beachy's assurances to creditors that he had turned away from riskier investments after his dot-com losses and had never traded on margin.
More than a dozen churches, church building funds, fellowships and ministries lost money in Mr. Beachy's downfall. One family's losses included the emergency savings relied upon by its daughter and son-in-law, serving as missionaries in Central America.
Many A & M accounts were small by Wall Street standards, but were crucial in a community whose citizens may have religious scruples against drawing Social Security benefits. The anxiety and confusion of many elderly investors is evident in the handwritten notes in the bankruptcy court docket.
''Greetings in the Name of Jesus!'' one 76-year-old widow in the Miller clan wrote. ''I had [$]4,327.80 in A & M Investments with Monroe Beachy. And I would like to tell you that I need it very badly.'' She described her current ailments, osteoarthritis and diabetes, and concluded: ''I hope and pray you can send me my money back. I need it. Thank you kindly.''
WITHIN weeks of Mr. Beachy's bankruptcy, religious leaders were working on a proposal to handle the settlement of claims outside the court process, using the cash remaining in the estate, as well as donations from Amish and Mennonite communities nationwide.
In a document submitted to the court, the ad hoc committee organizing the effort explained the Plain Community's feelings about the bankruptcy. ''Bankruptcy is morally abhorrent and is not consistent with the values we hold,'' the committee said. ''It is a dishonorable discharge of debts.''
One passage in the document called for Mr. Beachy's clients to seek reconciliation with him. Forgiving a brother does not require shielding him from his fate, it said. But extending charity ''to those harmed, and to those that have done the harm is our testimony to the world of love and forgiveness.''
Wayne H. Wengerd, the committee chairman, said last week that he had known the effort ''was a long shot -- but it was important to provide a testimony to the world and to our own people about what we stand for.'' He added: ''We were willing to sacrifice to live out those teachings. The teachings are more important than money.''
The committee also sent out a letter of apology from Mr. Beachy:
''Hello: At A & M Investments our aim was to provide a decent rate of interest and for a number of years it worked. However some investments in stocks and bonds should not have been made and when they went bad I should have asked for advice from other people and the church. Instead I kept this to myself and went on hoping to recover at least some of the loss. But then we were forced to shut down at a low point in the economy and the loss is large. I am really sorry for this.''
He concluded: ''I have made a confession to God and the church and feel I have been forgiven. I hope you can forgive me too.''
For the Amish plan to be put into action, the bankruptcy court would have had to dismiss Mr. Beachy's case and turn back the clock to the moment before his filing. Only then could his dealings with creditors follow a different path.
The committee's vigorous campaign to have the Beachy case dismissed, based on the First Amendment's religious freedom protections and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, won wide support. More than 2,300 creditors filed form letters with the court endorsing the plan.
THERE may have been some practical reasons for that. The public's fascination with the charm of the Amish is the bedrock of the tourist economy here, and the Sugarcreek scandal was an ugly scar on that landscape. A solution emphasizing fundamental Amish values might well neutralize any damage that the Beachy case inflicted on the Amish image.
But the campaign's intensity left some non-Amish creditors feeling uncomfortable. One grandmother recalled attending a meeting at which supporters insisted on a ''standing vote,'' not a secret ballot. She opposed the plan, she said, but she remained seated because she felt intimidated at having her position exposed publicly.
No such qualms afflicted the S.E.C. legal staff, the United States Trustee's office and the bankruptcy trustee. In court, they all stood firmly against the alternative plan. It would lack judicial oversight and protections against mismanagement or unequal treatment, they argued. And it could well be unconstitutionally unfair to a small minority of non-Amish creditors, who would be steered out of court and into a religious forum tacitly endorsed by the government.
Last March, Federal Bankruptcy Judge Russ Kendig in Canton, in the federal courthouse closest to Sugarcreek, ruled that ''delegating insolvency proceedings to a religious body'' would be unconstitutional.
Given the high constitutional hurdle, the judge said, Mr. Beachy simply had not ''met his burden'' for showing why his case should be dismissed after it had started moving through the court. Once ''the rock begins to roll,'' he concluded, something much stronger than a change of mind is required to stop it.
No part of this story contrasts as sharply with the real Bernie Madoff case as what happened next.
In the Madoff bankruptcy, virtually every adverse ruling has been appealed by the losing side, as have disputed decisions in countless other high-profile bankruptcy cases. But when the Amish leaders lost their passionate plea, rooted in their deeply held religious beliefs, they simply sent the judge a letter.
''We are agreed among ourselves to accept your ruling as the will of Almighty God in this matter,'' they wrote, after thanking him for considering their point of view so carefully. ''If there is anything which we can do as members of the Amish-Mennonite community to facilitate the bankruptcy process and help bring it to a speedy conclusion please do not hesitate to contact any member'' of the committee.
On Sept. 15, 2011, more than a year after Monroe Beachy closed his office and made his fateful trip to bankruptcy court, federal prosecutors held a press conference in Cleveland to announce that he had been indicted on mail fraud charges arising from a ''scheme to defraud'' that they said dated back to 1990.
He is scheduled to go to trial next month in Youngstown. If convicted, he faces a possible jail term of up to 20 years. His court-appointed defender, a prominent Youngstown criminal defense lawyer, J. Gerald Ingram, did not respond to messages seeking comment on the case.
The bankruptcy case in Canton, meanwhile, is moving forward. The trustee, Ms. Silagy, is optimistic that up to 50 cents on the dollar ultimately can be returned to investors, according to her lawyer, Bruce R. Schrader. Some creditors have filed letters with the court expressing frustration with the delay, but he said that only about 400 creditor claims, out of 2,600, have not been pursued in court.
The criminal trial, scheduled to open on March 19, will no doubt generate new headlines in Sugarcreek -- which would much rather tell the world the sort of news it had last month: the village will soon install one of the world's largest cuckoo clocks.
Mayor Clayton Weller of Sugarcreek says he hopes the trial will not cause renewed rancor. ''I personally feel that the people are accepting what has happened,'' he said. ''They are understanding, and most of them are forgiving.''
But as the church fathers see it, something of lasting importance was tried in Sugarcreek.
''A hundred years from now, what will be the difference about how much money we had here?'' asked Emery E. Miller, a village resident and a proponent of the alternative plan, at the first creditors meeting. ''But a hundred years from now, there will be a difference in how we responded to this from our moral being, from a moral level -- the choices we made to forgive or not to forgive.''

HEADLINE: The Country Just Over the Fence

BYLINE: By PAUL THEROUX. 
PAUL THEROUX is the author, most recently, of ''The Tao of Travel: Enlightenments From Lives on the Road.'' His new novel, ''The Lower River,'' will be published in May by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

 BODY:
A SIMPLE painted sign on a wooden board -- ''To Mexico'' -- was propped near the door in the fence, but it was the fence itself that fascinated me. Some masterpieces are unintentional, the result of a freakish accident or an explosive act of sheer weirdness, and the fence that divides Nogales, Ariz., from Nogales, Mexico, is one of them.
In a lifetime of crossing borders I find this pitiless fence the oddest frontier I have ever seen -- more formal than the Berlin Wall, more brutal than the Great Wall of China, yet in its way just as much an example of the same folie de grandeur. Built just six months ago, this towering, seemingly endless row of vertical steel beams is so amazing in its conceit you either want to see more of it, or else run in the opposite direction -- just the sort of conflicting emotions many people feel when confronted with a peculiar piece of art.
You can, of course, also go through it, which is what I wanted to do. And there was the entryway, just past J. C. Penney and Kory's clothing shop -- a door in the wall at the end of hot, sunlit Morley Avenue. 
After leaving my car at a secure parking lot ($4 a day), I showed my passport to the United States border guard, who asked about my plans. Business?
''Just curiosity,'' I said. When he made a disapproving squint, I added, ''Don't you go over now and then?''
''Never been there,'' he said.
''It's 10 feet away!''
''I'm staying here,'' he said, his squint now suggesting that I should be doing the same.
I pushed the turnstile and stepped through the narrow door -- no line, no other formalities -- into the state of Sonora, Mexico, where I was instantly, unmistakably in a foreign land. The roads were bumpier, the buildings vaguely distressed; I was breathing in the mingled aromas of bakeries, taco stands and risen dust.
Glancing back a moment later, I could not see Arizona anymore, only the foreground of Mexico -- small children kicking a ball, men in sombreros conferring under a striped awning, steaming food carts.
I TREASURE border crossings, and the best of them are the ones where I've had to walk from one country to another, savoring the equality of being a pedestrian, stepping over the theoretical line that is shown on maps, from Cambodia into Vietnam, from Pakistan into India, from Turkey into the Republic of Georgia. Usually a frontier is a river -- the Mekong, the Rio Grande, the Zambezi; or a mountain range -- the Pyrenees, the Rwenzoris. It can also be a sudden alteration in topography, a bewildering landscape transformation -- hilly Vermont flattening into Quebec. But just as often a border is a political expedient -- irrational yet unremarkable -- creating a seamless no man's land, just a width of earth, bounded by fences.
I am nattering on about this border fence, partly because it is a visual marvel, something like a stockade, and also because, as the guard demonstrated, it calls for a decision. Do you go through, or stay home? It used to be a more casual proposition. Nogalans remember when it was a modest enclosure known as la linea, the line, when the main street between the two towns was more or less contiguous.
''We had a parade every spring,'' Nicolas Demetrio Kyriakis told me. Nicolas, from an entrepreneurial family of Greek immigrants to Mexico, is a regidor, a Nogales town counselor and one of the advisors to Nogales's mayor. ''Floats went down the street and into Nogales, Arizona. A coronation was held on a platform on la linea, and the Fiesta de Mayo Queen was crowned. Both towns celebrated.''
That was 30 years ago. Back then Nogales, Mexico, was still a destination for servicemen from big, busy Fort Huachuca, a United States Army post about 25 miles as the crow flies to the northeast. Visitors from Tucson and beyond would pop over for a break from the routine, an opportunity to buy clay pots, sombreros, drink a world-class margarita, and visit a taqueria or sample local food. In the 1940s, cowboy films were made in the area. Hollywood actors crossed the border to eat and raise mild hell in La Caverna, a well-known club run by Nicolas's cousins.
Such was the bond of the two border towns that when the old elegant Hotel Olivia on the Mexican side caught fire in the 1960s, and the situation became desperate, water hoses were tossed over the fence by the fire brigade in Arizona to help the local bomberos put it out, an act of neighborliness that is still fondly remembered by the Nogalans.
But everyone I spoke to agreed that conditions have changed. They said that when soldiers from Huachuca stopped visiting after 9/11 and guards started asking to see passports, the influx of visitors slowed to a trickle. And there was another theme: since the emphasis across America was on scrutinizing aliens, why would anyone wish to become an alien oneself? The repeated news stories of cartels taking over didn't help: cross the Mexican border and risk dying like a dog.
''After the bombing of the World Trade Center, things went down,'' Juan Cordero, the director of the Department of Economic Development in this part of Sonora, told me. ''But it was massage parlors and bars on Canal Street, and curio shops downtown, an old-fashioned business model. Sure, we still had lots of American factories in our industrial area -- thousands of people are employed there -- but we have just a few tourists.''
And yet, here I was, a tourist, savoring the satisfaction of having eased myself into another country to enjoy the difference, with the tourist's presumption that I deserved a good time. And I had the instant gringo's assurance that my country, and my car, were just behind the tall fence at the frontera.
So what can you do with a couple of days in Nogales? Take advantage of its nearness, first of all. Buy cowboy boots, or pots, or folk art. I came away with a hand-carved set of dominoes, some silver coins and cleaner, whiter teeth.
On my first day I had a margarita at the Salon Regis. I asked the bartender about events in town. He thought a moment, then said, ''Super Bowl on Sunday.''
Dinner at La Roca, which is just minutes from the fence, was pleasurable for my being in the hands of the sort of knowledgeable dark-suited old waiters that have disappeared from most of the world's restaurants. Many have worked at La Roca since it opened (its 40th anniversary was celebrated this year). These men were the stalwarts at the restaurant at my hotel too, the Hotel Fray Marcos. At La Roca I had tortilla soup and as an entree a Mexican melange of fresh shrimp from Guaymas on the Sonoran coast. Elsewhere in town, even the smaller places such as Leos or Zapatas offered plates of dried shredded beef known as mochomos and delicious tacos.
I found the Nogalans courtly and easy to meet, grateful to have a visitor to the point where one demonstration of neighborliness was an offer of a swig of bacanora, a drink made from agave and Sonora's gift to the world of drinkable rocket fuel -- stronger than tequila.
It is obvious from the empty streets of downtown Nogales that very few visitors stay the night, but I found that overnighting simplified my experience of the place. The Hotel Fray Marcos has mixed reviews but I found it excellent (my suite went for around $80). It was also conveniently near the office of Dr. Jose Saturno, who on successive days worked on my teeth -- the full limpieza ($54) y blanquiamento ($250).
There have always been inexpensive dentists in Nogales, but the combination of rising health costs in the United States (and the fact that many retiree health plans don't include dental) along with the availability of cheap real estate in Nogales has created a dentistry boom here, which is expanding to include spa and other services as well.
At Laser Tech over on Obregon Street, Dr. Francisco Vazquez enlarged his dental practice a year ago to include a dermatology unit, and his wife (and mother of three), Martha Gonzales, opened a spa with treatments that included not only massage and steam baths but also ''ancient rituals'' inspired by the Aztecs, and for good measure hired Dr. Angel Minjares, whose specialties are theology and psychology, for ''assessments.''
Their businesses are among the approximately 60 dental ''wellness'' practices here, mainly concentrated in a three-block area all within easy walking distance from the border gate. Most of the patients are American retirees nipping over for the day from Tucson or nearby Green Valley.
Gerd Roehrig, an older Tucson resident originally from Germany, was seeing Dr. Ernesto Quiroga about an implant. What would have cost him $4,500 in his hometown of Tucson, he said, was about a third of that in Nogales. Creating a further enticement, Dr. Quiroga recently invested $150,000 in a 3-D scanning machine for CAT scans.
''I guess Canal Street could now be called Root Canal Street,'' I said to Juan Cordero, after my treatment.
He sighed. ''People are worried, '' he said. ''They think Nogales is dangerous. You know the expression poner salsa a los tacos?''
Slather sauce on the tacos -- exaggerate.
To try to get a handle on just how dangerous my visit was, I asked to meet the Secretary for Public Safety in Sonora and was introduced to Ernesto Munro Palacio, a 6-foot-3 businessman and former pitcher for the Monterrey Sultans, who, since 2009, has been responsible for security in the state.
''Prior to [2009] there was very little investment in security,'' he said. ''But within the past two years Sonora had invested $100 million in helicopters, armored cars and surveillance planes, to find the landing strips of organized crime and the marijuana farms.''
Murders are a problem all over Mexico, and they have devastated cities like Ciudad Juarez, which is a cartel battleground. But Secretary Munro said that in Nogales the murder rate has declined from 210 in 2010 to 83 in 2011 and that they are almost exclusively drug related.
''Ask your people if they know the name of one American who's been killed in Sonora,'' he said. ''No tourist has ever been killed in Nogales.''
The State Department said that in the two years from Jan. 1, 2010, to Dec. 31, 2011, there were 21 reported homicides of American citizens in Nogales and advises that visitors to Sonora travel on main roads and only during daylight hours. Meanwhile, the Arizona governor, Jan Brewer, who earlier this month said that she should be an ''ambassador for Sonora,'' enthusiastically promotes tourism in the area. I heard even more robust testimonials about Sonora, and Nogales in particular, from the Americans I met seeking dental care, who remarked on the hospitality of the city.
The Bianchis, a retired couple from Tucson I met in a waiting room, were content. ''We come here all the time,'' Mr. Bianchi said. ''I got bridgework. And, hey, people are nice.''
Nogales is a border town trying to save itself, and I think succeeding. I was struck, walking the city, by the distinct air of foreignness mingled with a pleasing ordinariness -- children at play on school playgrounds, shoppers, churchgoers -- the pleasures and routines of Mexico. The visible absence of travelers gives the city a greater feel of difference, as do the brightly painted houses that dot hillsides, the result of a scheme by the Nogales mayor, Jose Angel Hernandez Barajas, who created an Urban Image Department, which provides free paint for any who wish to spruce up their home. He has also created schools and sports programs, as well as teams of street cleaners.
The streets of Nogales are as tidy as any on the American side, and full of surprises. On my way to see the boomtown that lies beyond downtown and the dental clinics, I passed a two-story sculpture of a muscular naked youth spearing a winged reptilian figure sprawled at his feet. Officially known as ''The Defeat of Ignorance'' (''La Derrota de la Ignorancia''), the statue (designed by the Spanish sculptor Alfredo Just, in the late 1960s) is fondly referred to by Nogalans as mono bichi -- ''the naked guy'' in a local phrase that is partly Yaqui. (Nogalans scatter their speech with Yaqui words that are incomprehensible elsewhere, like buki for child and yori blanco for white man.)
I was to discover that the neighborhoods just across the fence are not representative of the town at large, which is a lesson in how to know another country: stay longer, travel deeper, overcome timidity. Tourists usually stick close to the fence, which accounts for the density of curio shops, and now the density of dental practices. But that downtown of Nogales is misleading.
DRIVING a few miles south with Juan Cordero I saw how Nogales sprawled, with newly built and modern subdivisions near more modest ones, all comprising Nuevo Nogales. ''This is the main economic engine driving Nogales,'' Juan said. The majority of the 32,000 people employed in Nogales work in the Industrial Area in factories making cellphone components, semiconductors, air ducts for jumbo jets. Most of the names are familiar -- Otis Elevator, Black & Decker, Chamberlain garage door openers, Rain Bird Sprinklers, General Electric, Watts Water Technologies, Flextronics, B/E Aerospace. Some companies like Kimberly-Clark and Motorola have been here since the late 1960s. The lives and working conditions of such employees are well described in William T. Vollmann's ''Imperial,'' an exhaustive account of an area that encompasses California and Mexico, which in its complexity and conflict resembles the Nogales border.
These are skilled workers. Those without education or manufacturing skills, the so-called campesinos, look elsewhere for work, and often cross the border to find it. Many who end up in the United States without papers are caught, jailed for a period, and bused to the border. This, too, is a revelation from the other side of the high fence.
Nogales is where they are dumped. Peg Bowden, a retired nurse, brought me to El Comedor, a shelter run by American Jesuits near the Mariposa gate just about a mile west of downtown Nogales. Ms. Bowden told me she was so shocked by the savage attack on Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson in January 2011 that she decided to do something humane: ''I needed to connect with something positive.'' She joined a group of Samaritans -- ''a bunch of renegade senior citizens whose mission is to prevent deaths in the desert,'' and she volunteered at El Comedor, working a few days a week, crossing the border from Arizona.
As a trained nurse she is useful, treating bullet wounds and severe hypothermia and the effects of starvation and exposure -- common among border crossers. ''Last week we had a girl who'd been lost in the desert for three days. She was 14.''
It was another day in Nogales, another revelation for me, and by far the most melancholy. In El Comedor, 160 lost souls, most of them adults, and four small children, were seated on benches, at communal tables, eating breakfast in an open-sided shelter at the side of the road.
Some had been longtime residents in the United States -- Alejandro, a restaurant worker in North Carolina for 13 years, Arnulfo a carpenter for 11.
''I spent 20 years in Napa picking strawberries,'' Maria, an older woman in a long black dress, told me. ''My husband and children are there. I came to Mexico for my father's funeral.'' She was wearing her funeral dress. She couldn't return to the United States, nor did she have a home in Mexico anymore.
They were soft-spoken, humbled and hopeless. A woman in her 20s, Rosalba, had spent four days in the desert. She had blistered feet, a deep wound from a cactus thorn and a severe infection. Some had been caught making their first crossing. Others had been sent home after years in the United States.
The saddest case to me was a woman from Oaxaca. Abandoned, with no money, no prospects and no hope of making a living in Oaxaca, she left her three children in the care of her mother and crossed the border with four other women, in the hope of finding work. Somehow separated from the other women, she was found in the desert.
''It's like 'Sophie's Choice,' '' Peg Bowden said.
She accepted her fate, but I will never forget the sight of her alone at the table, a plate of food before her, eyes tightly shut, hands together uplifted in prayer.
I was just a tourist. The fence, which I discovered is less than three miles long, had hidden all of this -- the downtown, the factories, the restaurants, the residential subdivisions, the mall, the migrants, sad stories, happy stories.
It's there for anyone to discover, and so simple. It was as illuminating to me as any foreign travel I have taken anywhere in the world. In some ways, being so near home and taking less effort, it seemed odder, freighted with greater significance, this wider world at the end of Morley Avenue, just behind the fence.

HEADLINE: Record Number of Amateurs at Tournament in New Jersey

BYLINE: By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

 BODY:
The World Amateur Team Championships, held every year in four cities over Presidents' Day weekend, seem to be a rough barometer for how the economy is doing.
In 2008, before the recession really took hold (although it had begun the previous December), 291 teams and 1,250 players, a record number, competed in the Amateur Team East event in Parsippany, N.J. 
The next year, the number of teams in the East dipped to 283. In 2010, just after the recession ended, there were 271 teams and 1,150 players. The next year, participation rose to 1,200 players.
Last weekend, the East championship set another record with 294 teams and about 1,300 players. The Amateur Team South tournament, held in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., also had a record number of players this year, according to the United States Chess Federation.
Steve Doyle, who has directed the East tournament for years, said in an e-mail that he believed an improvement in the economy had accounted for the rise.
The teams at each event are made up of four players, and the average rating cannot exceed 2,200, the level of a master. There are no cash prizes, but the competition is fierce.
There is entertainment value, too: players are encouraged to come up with team names based on current events, with a favorite chosen by a tournament vote. This year's winner in the East was ''Team Romney: We Play Both Sides of the Board,'' which beat out ''Occupy the Center: 99 Percent Solution'' and ''Tried the Brady Gambit, but Welker Dropped the Pieces,'' an allusion to the New England Patriots' performance in the Super Bowl.
The East title came down to a battle between a team led by Robert Hess, one of the country's top players, and one led by Rusudan Goletiani, a former United States women's champion. In the end, Hess beat Goletiani, and his team edged hers, 2.5 to 1.5, to win the championship.
Hess chose the Alapin Variation of the Sicilian Defense and gained a small edge out of the opening. But he lost that advantage when he played 15 Qd4 instead of 15 Bg5.
Later, Goletiani should have played 22 ... f6, which would have undermined Hess's outpost on d6. After 25 ed6, the pawn on d6 was uncomfortable for her.
Hess's 35 Rc6 was a mistake; he should have played 35 Nb5. But Goletiani missed her chance. She could have played 35 ... Ne7, when she would have won the d6 pawn after 36 Rc7 Nf5 37 Rd3 Nd6. She made a second error with 38 ... Rd7. Instead, 38 ... a5 would have been fine. After losing the a pawn, she faced an uphill fight.
Perhaps she should have tried 48 ... Nh2, as after 49 a5 ba5 50 ba5 Ng4 51 a6 Nf6 52 Nc7 Nd7 53 a7 Nb6, it would not have been clear how White could have won.
Goletiani could not trade knights by playing 52 ... Nc4 because she would have lost. But after 59 Ke6, she could not stop Hess from gobbling up her pawns, so she resigned.

HEADLINE: The Car Pool Lane Can Be Yours, for a Price

BYLINE: By JOSIE GARTHWAITE

 BODY:
THE businessman at the front of the early boarding line for your last cross-country flight may have gotten there without enduring 100,000 miles sardined into Row 34. Quite possibly, his privileged frequent-flier status was a credit card perk -- or even bought outright.
Lately, that concept of putting a price on convenience has been adapted as a way to manage traffic congestion. Going beyond the existing model of rewarding commuters who fill the empty seats in their cars, these programs offer access to lanes once reserved for high-occupancy vehicles.
In short, the H.O.V. lane is making way for the High Occupancy Toll lane.
Since October, a program created to improve traffic flow in restricted-use lanes around Atlanta has made it possible for solitary motorists to buy their way into the express lane; car pools of three or more, eligible alternative-fuel vehicles, motorcycles and an expanded fleet of buses can still scoot in free. Payment is made using an electronic transponder, and under what the Georgia Transportation Department calls value pricing, tolls increase as traffic in the restricted lane builds. The rate can vary from 1 cent to 90 cents a mile. 
The goal of the program, logically, is to keep traffic in the restricted lane moving at a reliable pace. Still, it did not have the intended effect of improving commutes along the 15.5-mile stretch of Interstate 85 in Gwinnett and DeKalb Counties -- at least, not at first.
''Before this was put in, we didn't have daily gridlock,'' said Howard Rodgers, who commutes from his Lawrenceville home, in Gwinnett County.
He has found plenty of support for his view. Within a month of the HOT lane's opening, Mr. Rodgers and a coalition of local groups had gathered thousands of signatures on a petition calling on state and county authorities to stop or suspend the program immediately.
The source of his displeasure: ''The time it takes me to get home, and the time away from my family,'' Mr. Rodgers said in a telephone interview. Driving in the free lanes, he said, the 45-mile trip home from work during rush hour had doubled to a 90-minute or even two-hour grind since the conversion. He credits the petition drive for the state's decision to delay a second lane-access project.
The shake-up of who gets to use express lanes, and at what price, extends beyond Atlanta. California air-quality regulators ended single-occupant H.O.V. privileges for many types of hybrids last summer, revising the list of eligible vehicles to exclude older, conventional hybrids like the Toyota Prius in favor of plug-in hybrids and battery-electric cars. Likewise, the rules controlling lane access for hybrids in Virginia will change in July.
Like Atlanta, which secured a $110 million Transportation Department grant in 2008 for congestion reduction projects, cities including Dallas, Denver, Houston and Los Angeles have completed or are now converting car pool lanes to high-occupancy toll lanes with federal support. In December, Virginia secured a $20 million federal grant for a HOT lane project in the works for Interstate 95. The project, with a projected cost of more than $940 million, will connect with HOT lanes already under construction on the Capital Beltway.
Nicknamed Lexus lanes in the 1990s by critics who pointed out that many drivers would not be able to afford the privilege, HOT lanes are rarely introduced without some opposition. The debate over how to unclog American highways pits free-market fixes -- pricing schemes based on travel demands at specific times of day -- against government incentives that restrict roadways as a carrot for desirable behaviors like car-pooling or driving a less polluting car.
On Interstate 85 in Atlanta, motorists left the new toll lane virtually vacant for the first few days. Gov. Nathan Deal soon stepped in, slashing the maximum charge for traveling the full length of the corridor at peak travel times to $3.05, from $5.50, after less than a week of operation. And he asked federal authorities to allow two-person car pools to drive free in the toll lane. The Federal Highway Administration decided to maintain the three-person car pool requirement for HOT lane funds, however, writing in November that it was still too early to evaluate the program's effectiveness.
The old system was far from ideal. According to the Georgia Department of Transportation, morning travel speeds in the two-person car pool lane peaked at 36 miles an hour in 2005-6. In 2009, the lane picked up to 45 m.p.h. at the height of the morning commute. But the state attributed the increase to short-term gas shortages, gas price spikes, a slowing economy and road improvements, and worried that by 2015 the H.O.V. lane travel speeds would average only 26 m.p.h.
Indeed, cities including Seattle and Minneapolis have used HOT lanes to maintain average speeds upward of 50 m.p.h. in the toll lane more than 95 percent of the time. Even in Atlanta, where the program has met vocal opposition, the lane was used for about 7,300 trips each weekday in its first month, officials reported. By January that had grown to more than 11,600 trips per weekday.
In the first full work week of December, average speeds during the morning peak ranged from 39 to 63 m.p.h., compared with 30 to 57 m.p.h. in the general lanes. Toll rates reached no more than $3.75, and the daily trip averages for the month were $1.16.
Of course, commuters could have all of those benefits -- driving in the express lane without paying tolls -- if they traveled in car pools.
Eliminating the prized privilege for hybrids may have had some unintended consequence in the transition period while plug-in models remain relatively scarce. Researchers with the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Berkeley found that banning solo hybrid drivers from the car pool lane appeared to slow traffic across all lanes. Possibly because drivers feel uncomfortable blazing past stopped traffic at 70 m.p.h., and probably because cars switching out of the car pool lane must decelerate more, the researchers suggest, greater congestion in adjacent lanes slows travel speeds in the car pool lane.
According to Ellen Hanak, a senior policy fellow with the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, paid express lanes can do a lot more for changing behavior and reducing congestion than free car pool lanes.
''The nature of how land use and residential development and job development has occurred, we have more and more situations where car pools are just not convenient for people,'' she said in an interview at the organization's San Francisco headquarters.
Federal census data released last fall showed that in 2009 just 10 percent of United States workers took car pools to work; 76 percent of American workers drive to work alone. For suburban residents commuting to jobs in a city, solo driving is even more common, at 82 percent.
Despite thriving grass-roots ride-sharing plans like the ''casual car pool'' across the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, a lot of H.O.V. lanes have been underused, Ms. Hanak said. ''The idea with HOT lanes was 'O.K., let's use the capacity better and put a price on the availability of a faster lane.' ''
Although the old perception of HOT lanes as a privilege for the rich persists, Ms. Hanak said, ''Anybody who's a driver can at certain times find it really valuable to get somewhere faster. Time can be money for everybody.''
Not surprisingly, many businesses and researchers see technology as part of the solution. For example, I.B.M., the California Transportation Department and the Center for Innovative Transportation at the University of California, Berkeley have joined in a research initiative intended to bring more real-time data into traffic management.
Ms. Hanak said she believed technology could play an even larger role in smoothing the flow of highway traffic.
''Technology has evolved to the point where it's possible to move toward a system where we're charged in general for road use the way people are charged on these express lanes,'' she said.
For any solution, the ultimate test may be surviving some level of irrationality on the road.
''You've got to deal with this organic thing, which is the driving public,'' Ms. Hanak said.

HEADLINE: What High-I.Q. Investors Do Differently

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale.

 BODY:
YOU don't have to be a genius to pick good investments. But does having a high I.Q. score help?
The answer, according to a paper published in the December issue of The Journal of Finance, is a qualified yes.
The study is certainly provocative. Even after taking into account factors like income and education, the authors concluded that people with relatively high I.Q.'s typically diversify their investment portfolios more than those with lower scores and invest more heavily in the stock market. They also tend to favor small-capitalization stocks, which have historically beaten the broader market, as well as companies with high book values relative to their share prices. 
The results are that people with high I.Q.'s build portfolios with better risk-return profiles than their lower-scoring peers.
Certainly, caution is needed here. I.Q. tests are controversial as to what they measure, and factors like income, quality of education, and family background may not be completely controlled for. But the study's results are worth pondering for their possible implications.
The paper, by Mark Grinblatt of the University of California, Los Angeles, Matti Keloharju of Aalto University in Helsinki and Juhani Linnainmaa of the University of Chicago took advantage of some unusual data. The crucial numbers came from, of all places, Finland.
Why there? Two reasons. First, Finland requires all able young men to perform military service. As a result, the authors were able to obtain I.Q. test scores of all of men conscripted in Finland from 1982 to 2001.
Second, Finland had a wealth tax, and its citizens had to report their investment portfolios to the government. This means the authors could compare the men's I.Q. scores and their investing habits, as well as link those factors to other individual data. Similar data sets aren't available in other countries, however, so we may not want to generalize too much.
Still, the results are interesting. The authors didn't claim that people with high scores had some kind of monopoly on stock-picking genius. What they did contend was that these people tended to follow basic rules of successful investing.
In some ways, it's a puzzle why I.Q. scores would matter in this regard. After all, the view that people should diversify their investments, to avoid putting all their eggs in one basket, is widely accepted. It's not hard to diversify a portfolio or to have someone do it for you.
And another time-proven rule of investing -- that people should put a substantial amount of their money in the stock market -- might have its detractors, no matter what their I.Q. scores. That is especially possible given the volatility in the financial markets in recent years.
Yet only about half of all American adults have money in the stock market, directly or indirectly. So maybe something else is going on. If people can't figure out the financial markets on their own, they can entrust their money to professionals or heed professional advice. The real problem may not be that many people lack investing savvy or smarts. Perhaps what they lack is trust, or confidence in whom to trust.
Three economists, Luigi Guiso of the Einaudi Institute for Economics and Finance, Paola Sapienza of Northwestern and Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago, argued in a paper published in 2008 that many households avoid investing directly in stocks out of vague fears that they might be deliberately misled or cheated. Using results from a survey of households, this time in the Netherlands, the economists showed that those who indicated a high level of trust were 50 percent more likely to invest in the stock market. They were also more likely to have diversified their stock holdings. The paper, titled ''Trusting the Stock Market,'' was published in The Journal of Finance.
Knowing whom to trust, and relying on those who are trustworthy, is itself an aspect of intelligence. Mr. Guiso and his co-authors cited research that suggested that investment decisions relied significantly on a part of the brain called the Brodmann area 10. This region of the frontal cortex is believed to be associated with our ability to make inferences about others' preferences and beliefs based on their actions. Such social intelligence seems to reward some people more than others with an ability to put standard investment advice into practice.
Successful investing requires that we judge other people, and it relies on an ability to develop a good model of others' minds. It requires that we put into perspective recent angry rhetoric against Wall Street and understand that, while some criticisms are surely justified, others are just as surely exaggerated.
Anyone, regardless of background or education, may worry about being misled. The professionals tell us that the stock market is the best place to invest, but such assurances don't help us when the market swoons. Many pros assured us that housing prices would never decline, either.
But if we can somehow foster more trust in investment professionals, a full spectrum of people -- whatever their I.Q.'s -- might adopt a more successful approach toward investing.
THE Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 and now under the command of Richard Cordray, ought to be an important vehicle to help bring about such trust, by responding to complaints and making rules that will help restore confidence. The Office of Financial Education, one of its divisions, would seem to have a big role in this effort.
But there is only so much this agency can do. It has a budget amounting to less than $2 for every American adult in 2012, and much of that will go toward activities it is taking over from the Office of Thrift Supervision and other agencies.
The government, as well as those in financial and educational spheres, must think about how we can restore and strengthen ordinary people's trust in the financial markets. It doesn't take a high I.Q. to see that it's in everyone's interest to get basic financial decisions right.

HEADLINE: Black at Stuy

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS; Robert Gebeloff and Hiten Samtani contributed reporting.

 BODY:
LIKE a city unto itself, Stuyvesant High School, in Lower Manhattan, is broken into neighborhoods, official and otherwise. The math department is on the 4th of its 10 floors; biology is on the 7th. Seniors congregate by the curved mint wall off the second-floor atrium, next to lockers that are such prime real estate that students trade them for $100 or more. Sophomores are relegated to the sixth floor.
In Stuyvesant slang, the hangouts are known as ''bars.'' Some years ago, the black students took over the radiators outside the fifth-floor cafeteria, and the place soon came to be known as the ''chocolate bar,'' lending it an air of legitimacy in the school's labyrinth of cliques and turfs.
It did not last long. This year, Asian freshmen displaced the black students in a strength-in-numbers coup in which whispers of indignation were the sole expression of resistance. There was no point arguing, said Rudi-Ann Miller, a 17-year-old senior who came to New York from Jamaica and likes to style her hair in a bun, slick and straight, like the ballerina she once dreamed of becoming. 
''The Asian kids, they're just everywhere,'' she said.
When the bell rings and the school's 3,295 students spill out of classrooms into the maze of hallways, escalators and stairs like ants in a farm, blacks stand out because they are so rare. Rudi was one of 64 black students four years ago when she entered Stuyvesant, long considered New York City's flagship public school. She is now one of 40.
Asians, on the other hand, make up 72.5 percent of Stuyvesant's student body (they are 13.7 percent of the city's overall public school population), a staggering increase from 1970, when they were 6 percent of Stuyvesant students, according to state enrollment statistics. Back then, white students made up 79 percent of Stuyvesant's enrollment; this year, they are 24 percent, and 14.9 percent systemwide.
Hispanic students are 40.3 percent of the system. Currently, they make up 2.4 percent of Stuyvesant's enrollment, while blacks, who make up 32 percent of the city's public school students, are 1.2 percent.
New York City has eight specialized high schools whose admission is based entirely on the results of an entrance exam, a meritocratic system that does not consider race or ethnicity. The top score on the exam is 800. In recent years, the cutoff for Stuyvesant has been around 560; Rudi scored 594.
Earning a spot at Stuyvesant is unquestionably a badge of honor, sort of a secret knock to an exclusive club. As high school admissions decisions are revealed across the city in the coming week, many people are concerned that it is a club that black students -- and, to a similar extent, Latinos -- have an increasingly hard time cracking.
No one claims that the disparity is caused by overt discrimination. But in a school that is devised to attract the best of the best, parents and educators alike find the demographics troubling. It has become a question of perception as to who belongs.
The school's parent coordinator, Harvey Blumm, said that when he visited middle schools whose enrollments were overwhelmingly black and Latino, it was not uncommon to find students who had never heard about the specialized high school exam; or to meet students who had signed up for the exam, but had never thought of taking a practice test or prep course -- something common among white and Asian students; or to have guidance counselors tell him that Stuyvesant ''isn't for our kids.''
RUDI, who lives in the Wakefield section of the Bronx, attended sixth and seventh grades in Jamaica, and eighth grade in Mount Vernon, a Westchester County suburb. Her father, Donovan Miller, a director of accounting at Bronx Community College, recalled asking a colleague for advice about enrolling Rudi, the youngest of his three children, in ''the best New York City high school.'' The colleague advised Mr. Miller that he had to sign her up for the specialized high school exam and, if he wanted to improve her odds, to have her take some kind of test preparation program.
Many Stuyvesant students start preparing for the exam months, even years, in advance. There are after-school, weekend and summer classes run by large companies like Kaplan and Princeton Review, as well as by neighborhood outfits like Aim Academy, in the predominantly Chinese enclave of Flushing, Queens, and the Khan's Tutorial branch in nearby Jackson Heights, home to thousands of families from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Rudi took Kaplan's 12-week program, which met on Saturdays at Fordham University, at a cost of $750, the summer after seventh grade. (Students take the exam in October of their eighth-grade year.) Her tutor, a Stuyvesant graduate, persuaded her to make the school her first choice.
Her mother, Annmarie Miller, a nursing assistant at a hospital in the Bronx, recalled a cousin's reaction when she mentioned Rudi's pick: ''You have to be Chinese or Indian to get in there.'' A co-worker, also black, ''said the exam is built to exclude blacks because it's heavy on math, and black people can't do math,'' Mrs. Miller said.
Rudi said she has never felt uncomfortable at Stuyvesant, but she has felt puzzled. She has been the only black person in most of her classes, and often goes hours without seeing another. The school's attendance sheets have names and pictures of the students, and she said teachers were quick to learn who she is; there are few others like her, she said.
For Rudi, being black at Stuyvesant has been a journey of self-discovery. In Jamaica, as in parts of the Bronx, it is not skin color that distinguishes people, she said, but the car they drive, the neighborhood they live in or the job they have.
At school, she embraced her racial identity, becoming president last May of the Black Students League, the smallest of the school's four diversity clubs, which usually draws fewer than 10 regulars to its weekly meetings. She had run unopposed.
Rudi said the league wasn't ''about black power or anything like that,'' but to ''make Stuy aware of our community and our culture.''
It has been a frustrating task.
As part of Black History Month, the league screened an hourlong documentary, ''Slavery and the Law,'' which chronicles the status of blacks from colonial times through the civil rights era. There were 100 chairs in front of the pull-down screen at Stuyvesant's sixth-floor library; 15 students showed up.
''We've just never had the numbers to make it work,'' Rudi lamented.
Rudi's paternal grandfather arrived in America in 1968 and ultimately became a citizen. He paved the way for her parents, who arrived in 2006 to build their future -- in a house in the suburbs at first, then just over the city line in a suburban-seeming slice of the Bronx, on a street of children-at-play signs and matching brick homes. Rudi stayed behind in Jamaica to finish seventh grade, on a government scholarship at Campion College, a school her father described as the best in Jamaica, with her sister, Nadia, who was finishing college. (They have an older brother, who still lives there.)
Rudi landed at Kennedy International Airport on July 4, 2007, to live her parents' American dream. Nadia, who arrived a year later, gave modeling a try, and graduated from flight school before she discovered she was afraid of heights. Now she works at a bank and is considering medical school.
''Have you ever seen a doctor who's unemployed?'' Nadia, 25, asked their mother one night before dinner.
Rudi said, ''My sister is definitely smarter than me.'' Nadia said Rudi worked harder.
In January, a week before her midyear exams, Rudi e-mailed a friend, ''I'm STRESSED and SLEEP DEPRIVED! In fact, I won't be going to sleep tonight (second night in a row. ... Oh, well!)''
By then, she had already been accepted via early admission to Yale, her first choice. Nadia could not understand why Rudi did not just coast until graduation.
''I don't want to be an embarrassment to my teachers,'' Rudi said.
She has also had enough of the grumbling at Stuyvesant that black students do better in the college-admissions game because of their skin color.
YEAR after year, certain middle schools in New York -- Mark Twain Gifted and Talented in Coney Island, Brooklyn, and the Christa McAuliffe Middle School in nearby Bensonhurst -- send dozens of students to Stuyvesant, according to Mr. Blumm, the parent coordinator. (Last year, 112 students from Mark Twain and 85 from Christa McAuliffe enrolled at Stuyvesant, he said.) But years can go by without a single student from District 7, in a poor and heavily immigrant section of the South Bronx, earning admission.
Sometimes, Mr. Blumm said, blacks and Latinos who do well enough on the entrance exam to get into Stuyvesant are lured away by prestigious private high schools, which offer them full scholarships and none of the issues that even elite public schools have to contend with, like tight budgets and overcrowding. Last year, 11 black students enrolled. Eleanor Archie, an assistant principal who is black, said it was the fewest she can recall in her more than 20 years at Stuyvesant.
''That's what we keep worrying about,'' Ms. Archie said. ''It keeps getting smaller and smaller.''
Opraha Miles, who was president of the Black Students League before her graduation from Stuyvesant in 2010, said she feared the club would disappear for lack of members and interest. She said she used to have to ''hunt people down,'' dragging them from the chocolate bar to the league's meetings to ensure a quorum.
Ms. Miles, now 19 and a sophomore at Wesleyan University, remembered a discussion the league hosted when she was at Stuyvesant on the school's demographics, during which an Asian boy said, she recalled, ''Something to the effect that it wasn't our fault, but that blacks aren't smart enough; they don't work hard enough'' to get in.
''It still stings,'' she said.
In a separate discussion about their dwindling ranks, Ms. Miles said, a black student suggested, ''Why not go to the middle schools people like us attend and tell the kids about Stuyvesant?''
Stanley Teitel, the school principal, excused Ms. Miles and several others from class for a few hours so they could visit a school in Canarsie, Brooklyn, where the group spoke to an auditorium packed with sixth and seventh graders, fielding questions about what it was like to go to a school that was the stuff of legend, and if it was really that hard to get in.
The city does not track the race and ethnicity of students who take the specialized high school exam, only of those who receive offers from one of the schools, said a spokesman for the city's Education Department. In 2010, 28,280 students took the test; 5,404 scored high enough to earn a slot. The department did not have race or ethnicity information for 979 of those with sufficiently high scores because they came from private schools or from outside the city, and questions of race and ethnicity are not part of the exam application. But of the remainder, 47 percent were Asian, 23 percent were white, 6 percent were Hispanic, and 5 percent were black, according to city records.
Over the years, there have been a host of efforts to increase the number of black and Latino students at Stuyvesant and the other large specialized high schools in the city, Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Technical High School, like making interviews and grade-point averages part of the admissions process. At Brooklyn Tech, 10 percent of the 5,332 students today are black -- sizable in the realm of specialized high schools, but also a big drop from 1999-2000, when 24 percent were black. At Bronx Science, 3.5 percent of the 3,013 students are black, down from 9 percent in 1999-2000.
The number of blacks at Stuyvesant peaked in 1975, when they made up 12 percent of the school's enrollment, or 303 of the school's 2,536 students. In 1980, there were 212 black students; in 1990, 147; in 2000, 109; and in 2005, 66, state records show.
Lisa Mullins, who graduated from Stuyvesant in 1977 and is among the core members of its Black Alumni Association, suggested in an interview that the schools should automatically accept the valedictorian and salutatorian of every city middle school, an echo of the Texas program that grants admission to the state's flagship public university to the top 10 percent of graduates of every high school. Last week, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to the Texas program from a white student who said she had been rejected because of her race.
Ms. Miles, for her part, said the city needed do a better job disseminating information about the test and the free preparatory programs available.
The city's Education Department has been offering such a program, with weekend and summer coaching sessions to promising but disadvantaged sixth graders -- and, this year only, seventh graders -- for more than 20 years. Its original mission was to increase the number of blacks and Latinos, but after a legal challenge in 2007, income became its main eligibility criteria. Since then, however, the program has shrunk -- 2,800 students attended in 2008, down from 3,800 two years before -- and even among those who participated, black and Latino students were far less likely to take the entrance exam than Asians and whites. This year, Stuyvesant's Black Alumni Association started offering a more modest version of the tutoring program, benefiting about 100 students. (How they fared will not be known until this week's admissions letters are sent out.) The middle school visits by the Black Students League and others from Stuyvesant's diversity clubs have become an annual tradition.
About 10 years ago, Stuyvesant opted out of a program established in the 1970s to give disadvantaged students with exam scores just below the cutoff level a chance to study over the summer and earn a slot at the school.
Mr. Teitel, the principal, declined to comment for this article, but explained his decision last year, at a forum that was held after a video by a group of white students rapping racist and otherwise offensive lyrics made its way to YouTube. He said that a change in Education Department policies meant he could take into the program only students who scored too low for admission to any of the city's specialized schools, but not those who missed Stuyvesant's cutoff and got in somewhere else.
That would have most likely meant that students in the target group would have tested 80 or 90 points below the lowest-scoring student Stuyvesant had admitted -- a gap, he said, too wide for most of them to overcome.
''They would find it incredibly difficult to succeed,'' Mr. Blumm, the parent coordinator, said in an interview.
ABOUT three-quarters of Stuyvesant's students are immigrants or children of immigrants. Yet Angel Colon, a portly Puerto Rican who serves as adviser to the schools' diversity and community-service student groups, said he realized one day that there was a problem with the colorful brochures the black students brought to the middle schools they visited: ''There wasn't a black or brown face in the crowd,'' he said.
Mr. Colon, 44, whose formal education ended upon graduation from high school in the Bronx, has turned his office, on the seventh floor at Stuyvesant, into a kind of refuge for the school's gay, Latino and black students, drawing them partly with a generous supply of cookies and Rice Krispie Treats. The students seek him out for his simple wisdom -- ''You've got to be happy with who you are,'' he might tell them -- and his nonjudgmental ear.
A lot of black students, he said, have confided, ''If I could do it all over again, I don't know if I would have come here.''
''There's something very isolating,'' Mr. Colon said, ''about being one of the very few.''
Rudi has never harbored regrets. There have been disappointing and enraging moments, she said, like when a good friend, the only black senior in Stuyvesant's esteemed speech-and-debate team, was given a book on rap lyrics as a holiday gift from a white boy she had been mentoring.
Like many of her white and Asian classmates who make lengthy treks from the outer reaches of Brooklyn and Queens to Stuyvesant's campus near the site of ground zero, Rudi begins each day before dawn. She sets the alarm on her cellphone for 5:30 a.m., and puts it at the edge of her bed so she has to get up to turn it off. At 6:15, she rouses her father, who drives her to the Wakefield/241st Street stop on the No. 2 train to Manhattan.
One recent morning on the train, she rested her head on an environmental science book as thick and heavy as an encyclopedia volume, squeezed on each side by strangers drinking coffee and nodding off. Blue earphones piped in Bob Marley and U2 tunes, her antidote against the rattle of the hourlong ride.
After exiting at Chambers Street, she quick-stepped west, then across a pedestrian bridge and into the exclusive club, book pressed against her chest like armor as she lost herself in a sea of arriving students. Hers was the only black face in sight.
A System Divided: This is the first in an occasional series of articles examining the changing racial distribution of students in New York City's public schools and its impact on their opportunities and achievements.

HEADLINE: In Teacher Ratings, Good Test Scores Are Sometimes Not Good Enough

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN and ROBERT GEBELOFF; Alex Vadukul contributed reporting.

 BODY:
At Public School 234 in TriBeCa, where children routinely alight for school from luxury cars, roughly one-third of the teachers' ratings were above average, one-third average and one-third below average.
At Public School 87 on the Upper West Side, where waiting lists for kindergarten spots stretch to stomach-turning lengths, just over half the ratings were above average. The other half were average or below average on measure, based on student test scores.
And at Public School 29 in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, where many young parents move to send their children, four of the teachers' ratings were above average, seven were average and five were below.
The New York City Education Department on Friday released the ratings of some 18,000 teachers in elementary and middle schools based on how much they helped their students succeed on standardized tests. The ratings have high margins of error, are now nearly two years out of date and are based on tests that the state has acknowledged became too predictable and easy to pass over time. 
But even with those caveats, the scores still provide the first glimpse to the public of what is going on within individual classrooms in schools. And one of the most striking findings is how much variation there can be even within what are widely considered the city's best schools, the ones that each September face a crush of eager parents.
At Public School 321 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, for example, 10 teacher ratings were above average, 13 were average and 5 were below. At Public School 89 in TriBeCa, one of six rated math teachers received higher-than-average rankings, a lower rate than in the city as a whole. In many cases, teachers received two career ratings, one for math and one for English.
The principal cause of the wide variation within schools is the methodology of the ratings, which compares teachers with similar student demographics and scores. For teachers in schools with high-achieving students, good test results are often not good enough, at least by the standards set by the formula.
The city acknowledged that the model was ''too sensitive'' among teachers whose students did either very well or very poorly. That lesson was shared with schools and the state ''as it creates a new model for teacher evaluations,'' said Matthew Mittenthal, an Education Department spokesman.
The data, for example, showed 73 cases in which teachers whose students produced consistently outstanding test scores -- at or above the 84th percentile citywide -- were nonetheless tagged as below average. The reason? The formula expected even better results, based on the demographics and past performance of the students.
While the formula is only one aspect of teacher evaluations, the system represents a sea change in that teachers of such high-performing students will be held accountable for student improvement even if their students are far from failing.
In one extreme case, the formula assigned an eighth-grade math teacher at the prestigious Anderson School on the Upper West Side the lowest possible rating, a zero, even though her students posted test scores 1.22 standard deviations above the mean -- normally good enough to rank in the 89th percentile. Her problem? The formula expected her high-achieving students to be 1.84 standard deviations higher than the average -- roughly the 97th percentile.
Not all teachers who work with the city's better-off students can be ''above average,'' said Sean Corcoran, an associate professor of educational economics at New York University who has written about the city's scores, developed through a system called value-added modeling.
''The value-added measures are controlling for many of these factors,'' Mr. Corcoran said, ''so even if you just take the top students in the city, there is going to be a full distribution of teachers working with them, from high scoring to low.''
For parents, seeing the rankings of the teachers they know well can be shocking. Vicki Kahn, a parent at Public School 333, the Manhattan School for Children on the Upper West Side, was surprised to see that some of the teachers whom she considers outstanding had poor ratings, including one who routinely sends many of her students to a highly selective middle school.
''It seems completely wrong,'' Ms. Kahn said, adding that one of the co-teachers in the sixth grade did not even get a rating, in an apparent mistake.
Anna Rachmansky, whose son is a fifth grader at P.S. 89 in TriBeCa, was visibly stunned upon discovering that a teacher she held in high regard scored in the 10th percentile in math.
''I'm very surprised she would get poor in anything,'' Ms. Rachmansky said. ''She's a very strong educator.''
Sandra Blackwood, the co-president of the parent teacher association at Public School 41 in Greenwich Village, said she had little confidence that the data would be meaningful, though she felt it was important to look.
''If it is anything like the school grading system,'' she said, ''it will probably be highly arbitrary.''
Though parents can get a peek inside school buildings for the first time to see differences among teachers, it does not help if the underlying information is incorrect, Elizabeth Phillips, the principal of P.S. 321, said.
''What people don't understand is that they are just not accurate,'' she said. ''We are talking about minute differences in test scores that cause a teacher to score in the lowest percentiles,'' like a teacher whom she finds great and who scored in the sixth percentile because her students went to a 3.92 average test score from a 3.97, out of a possible 4.
And that is not to mention one teacher who had test scores listed for a year she was out on child care leave, Ms. Phillips said.
''The only way this will have any kind of a positive impact,'' she said, ''would be if people see how ridiculous this is and it gives New York State pause about how they are going about teacher evaluation.''
Despite the problems in the data, Dr. Corcoran said he did think the rankings could be useful in conjunction with classroom observations and what a parent already knew about a teacher. ''Even if you don't learn anything about teachers in the middle, which is most of them,'' he said, ''maybe you can see who the standouts are and who are the lowest performers.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Sunday about the publication by the New York City Education Department of performance rankings for 18,000 teachers misspelled the surname of a parent at Public School 333 on the Upper West Side who was surprised that some of the teachers whom she considered outstanding had earned poor ratings. She is Vicki Kahn, not Khan.

HEADLINE: Ultrasound: A Pawn in the Abortion Wars

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM. 
A national correspondent for The New York Times who covers religion and politics.

 BODY:
''INFORMED consent.'' It sounds so reasonable.
That's the stated goal of legislation being considered in Virginia that would require a woman seeking an abortion to first have an ultrasound, giving her an opportunity to examine the developing fetus and hear its heartbeat.
The anti-abortion groups promoting this idea say it serves patients' rights -- a way to empower women with information. That argument held in nine other states that have adopted ultrasound requirements in recent years.
But in Virginia, abortion rights advocates succeeded in reframing the proposal in the public mind as, instead, an outrageous threat to women's dignity. With their argument that the bill would force many women to undergo invasive vaginal ultrasounds, they helped start an uproar that led Virginia's governor and Legislature to back down and seek a weaker ultrasound law. 
The original bill did not explicitly mention vaginal ultrasounds, which involve placing a wand inside the body. But it required doctors to offer patients a clear picture of the fetus and a chance to listen to its heartbeat. In the first trimester, when most abortions take place, that requires a vaginal probe, not the ''jelly on the belly'' abdominal scans done later in the pregnancy, when the fetus is larger.
Abortion rights advocates seized the opportunity. ''Akin to rape,'' one legislator called the bill. ''Asking doctors to commit a sex crime,'' declared another. Liberal women's groups fanned outrage over ''forced vaginal penetration,'' and Virginia was mocked on comedy shows.
Trying to head off a political debacle, Gov. Bob McDonnell, who is believed to harbor higher political ambitions, said on Wednesday that the bill must be amended ''to explicitly state that no woman in Virginia will have to undergo a transvaginal ultrasound involuntarily.'' A revised law is expected to pass in coming days -- still requiring that a woman have an ultrasound and be offered descriptions of the fetus, but giving her the right to refuse a vaginal probe. Informed consent or legalized rape? Vital help for women, or the deliberate infliction of shame?
''To frame an issue is to reduce it to a story for which there is only one possible outcome,'' said Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguistics scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. In this case, he said, anti-abortion forces tried to define the ultrasound mandate as something benign and nonpolitical, while their opponents, with unaccustomed success, have cast it in the most ominous terms.
Amid the clamor over invasive probes, anti-abortion groups protested -- correctly -- that vaginal ultrasounds are commonly performed before first-trimester abortions anyway. They help determine, for example, whether gestational age is early enough to permit a drug-induced rather than a surgical abortion.
But it is an intolerable leap, many doctors and women's groups say, from a medical decision between doctor and patient to a requirement based on politics and religion. Equally objectionable, they say, is prescribing what information a woman should hear.
''There are no other situations where the legislature injects itself into the examining room and dictates how physicians practice,'' said Dr. Scott Spear, medical director for Planned Parenthood in central Texas and the Austin region.
Since early this month, after a federal appeals court said it did not violate the Constitution, a Texas law that is even stronger than the Virginia proposal has been in effect, with far less hue and cry. Not only must doctors perform vaginal ultrasounds in many cases, but they must face the monitor toward the patient, making it hard for her to look away, and they must describe the image in detail.
Tracy Weitz, a sociologist and expert on abortion care at the University of California, San Francisco, said that timing could be a factor in the sharp reaction to Virginia's proposal. It closely followed the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation's plan to cut its financial support to Planned Parenthood and the fight over the contraception mandate, she noted, so ''the Virginia law is a stand-in for a larger set of angers.''
The idea of requiring vaginal probes, in particular, stirred up potent emotions, Ms. Weitz said. ''It feels like old-school punishment of women for sexual impropriety, and I think that's why people are responding so viscerally.''
Since around 2005, passing state ultrasound requirements has been a major goal of the anti-abortion movement as it seeks to chip away at the right to abortion guaranteed by Roe v. Wade. The drive started with several states' requiring doctors to perform ultrasounds as part of pre-abortion counseling and to offer women the chance to look at the monitor. Recently, the laws have gotten tougher, said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager with the liberal Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive health.
Oklahoma, North Carolina and Texas passed laws requiring that the ultrasound screen face the woman and spelling out in detail what the doctor must describe, effectively requiring vaginal probes in most cases. The laws in Oklahoma and North Carolina remain blocked as federal courts consider whether they violate First Amendment rights.
''For a long time it was about shaming women,'' Ms. Nash says of the evolving ultrasound proposals. ''And now it's about humiliating women.''
But Mary Spaulding Balch, director of state legislation for National Right to Life, says that placing the screen before the patient and requiring doctors to point out the physical features of the fetus does women a favor -- giving them information they need without forcing them to agonize over whether they want it.
''When someone is already under a great deal of stress, the burden should not be on the person to ask,'' she says. ''The responsibility should be on the provider to tell, or in this case, display.''
It is an article of faith among abortion opponents that when women seeking abortions see evidence of a living thing in their bodies, some change their minds. This is fed by anecdotes from so-called crisis-pregnancy centers run by religious groups promoting abortion alternatives.
But studies in clinics indicate that viewing an ultrasound does not change minds, says Ms. Weitz, the sociologist.
''The women who come in for an abortion know what they are doing,'' she told me. Six in 10 women seeking abortions, she added, have already had a baby.
''Women are having abortions because of the conditions of their lives, their economic situation, their partner situation, their age,'' she said, ''and the ultrasound doesn't change that.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A news analysis article last Sunday about the role of ultrasound in abortion debates misspelled, at one point, the surname of a medical sociologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies abortion care. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, she is Tracy Weitz, not Dietz.

HEADLINE: Moral Hazard: A Tempest-Tossed Idea

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
THE reports outraged America: In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, people who fled the ravaged Gulf Coast were spending disaster relief, paid for by taxpayers, on tattoos, $800 handbags and trips to topless bars.
It turned out that few, if any, Katrina evacuees actually did any such thing. A vast majority used debit cards issued by FEMA to buy necessities like food and clothing. But the damage was done: FEMA swore that it would never hand out money like that again.
Behind this brouhaha was an idea that Americans seem particularly preoccupied with. It is called ''moral hazard'' -- an obscure insurance term that has taken on new currency in our troubled economy. We've heard a lot about moral hazard lately, first in connection with the bailouts for big banks, and now with efforts to help homeowners who got in over their heads. 
Moral hazard sounds like the name of a video game set in a bordello, but in economic terms it refers to the undue risks that people are apt to take if they don't have to bear the consequences. In other words, if the money is free, why not spend it on a designer purse? If you know that you'll be bailed out, why not roll the dice on some tricky mortgageinvestments -- or splurge on a home that you can't really afford?
Moral hazard became part of the national conversation in the financial crisis of 2008, when ordinary Americans wondered why they should rescue banks that helped drive the economy off a cliff. Now those same banks point to moral hazard to explain why they can't do more to help people with mortgages. And it's not just banks -- the Tea Party movement was inspired by outrage over a government plan to, as Rick Santelli put it in a famous rant on CNBC, ''subsidize the losers' mortgages.''
The cherished American ideal of self-reliance has a flip side: discomfort with the idea of bailouts and safety nets. The notion that even a small portion of such aid might find its way to the undeserving can be enough to scuttle support, or restrict help so drastically that few can use it. The specter of moral hazard haunts a basic tension in American life: to what extent are people responsible for their own problems? The more trouble you're in, moral hazard suggests, the less we should help.
Bankers say that generously easing loan terms or reducing mortgages outright would only encourage homeowners who can pay to pretend they can't. It would also, the bankers say, send a dangerous message: a financial commitment isn't really a commitment. Economists and policy makers say the bankers are right -- but only to a point. Shaun Donovan, the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said that there was a ''nugget of truth'' to the moral hazard argument. But he also said that the best evidence indicated that only about 10 or 15 percent of mortgage defaults were by homeowners still financially capable of paying their mortgages. Most troubled homeowners, like the Katrina victims, are genuinely hard up.
Kamala D. Harris, the attorney general of California, is adamant that homeowners are not looking to abuse the system. ''I have met with these families,'' she said, ''and every single one of them wants to pay to stay in their homes.''
Still, the $26 billion deal that authorities struck with banks this month over foreclosure abuses -- a main element of which will require the banks to reduce homeowner debt -- angers some. Homeowners who keep paying their mortgages, even if their homes have lost value, reasonably wonder why neighbors who weren't as responsible are getting help.
On the other hand, the problems in the housing market are a problem for all of us. Many economists and housing experts agree that the debt that now looms over homeowners is holding back a broad recovery.
Since the settlement was announced, pressure has mounted for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage giants whose loans are not eligible for the deal, to allow debt relief for their borrowers as well. But concerns over moral hazard, among other things, have held them back.
MORAL hazard has long been used to explain why social safety nets like welfare, unemployment insurance and workers' compensation should be less generous. It is almost always applied to the recipients, rather than the providers, of such benefits. A lot of energy has gone into arguing that higher workers' comp payments, for example, make workers careless. Far less is said about how lower workers' comp invites moral hazard for employers by, say, making them less attentive to workplace safety.
Economists have longcomplained that moral hazard could easily be described in more neutral language, like ''misaligned incentives.'' But the term, with its implied judgment, has stuck.
It seems to have originated in the 19th-century insurance industry. (Hazard was a popular game of dice.) Insurers drew a bright line between natural hazards, like storms, and moral hazards, like playing with matches, that stemmed from what the 1867 edition of the Aetna Guide to Fire Insurance called ''carelessness and roguery.''
Today, insurers battle moral hazard with co-pays and deductibles. If you have health insurance, you are, based on the theory of moral hazard, less likely to avoid smoking, and more likely to go to the doctor for a common cold. But in a 2005 article in The New Yorker, titled ''The Moral Hazard Myth,'' Malcolm Gladwell noted that people with insurance do not check into hospitals for their enjoyment, and that people without insurance forgo preventive care that could save thousands of dollars. Moral hazard also overlooks the noneconomic costs of risky actions like smoking -- costs like ruined lungs, suffering and death.
''The economics of moral hazard work to convince us that, however well intentioned, social responsibility is a bad thing,'' Tom Baker, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in ''On the Genealogy of Moral Hazard,'' a historical account published in 1996. ''Moral hazard signifies the perverse consequences of well-intentioned efforts to share the burdens of life, and it also helps deny that refusing to share those burdens is mean-spirited or self-interested.''
That is not to say that there is no such thing as moral hazard. Economists point to a 2008 settlement in which Countrywide Financial announced that it would modify subprime loans for people who were delinquent. Suddenly, many of Countrywide's subprime customers stopped paying.
But remedies can be designed to reduce moral hazard, said Adam J. Levitin, a Georgetown University law professor and mortgage expert. He points out that Countrywide, now owned by Bank of America, offered help only to those in default, instead of to all those who were given suspect loans. In the case of the debit cards, an investigation found that FEMA neither checked the identity of recipients nor told them how the money could be spent.
Under the new foreclosure settlement, only homeowners who were already delinquent will be eligible for principal reduction.
Plenty of other factors keep homeowners from trying to shirk commitments, said Elyse D. Cherry, C.E.O. of a community development group, Boston Community Capital. Ruined credit makes it harder to borrow money, get an apartment and, with employers increasingly doing credit checks, find a job. Moving is hard on families. And then there are the larger social costs: pockmarked neighborhoods and declining property values.
Moral hazard, Ms. Cherry said, ''is hogwash.'' That is an interesting view coming from a woman who runs what might be considered a petri dish for moral hazard. Boston Community Capital buys homes that have gone into foreclosure, then sells them back to the original owner at a price they can afford. If homeowners later sell at a profit, they must split the proceeds with Boston Community Capital.
Presumably anyone who heard about the program, which is small, would be tempted to default. Banks are so sensitive to this possibility that many forbid the resale of a foreclosed home to its original owner, even though it would make no difference to the banks' bottom line.
But usually, the clients have defaulted long before hearing about the program. Some, in fact, are packed and waiting for eviction.
Consider the case of one Boston Community client. In one view, she might seem like a classic case of moral hazard -- the kind of person many Americans are loath to help. When the banks offered to lend her money against the rising value of her home, she happily accepted. Now she owes $400,000 on a house worth closer to $100,000. Aiding her now might only encourage that type of behavior.
Another view is that she is a working person striving for the American Dream. She had every reason to believe that her bankers knew more about finance than she did. She paid a contractor for renovations; he absconded. When the recession hit, her work dried up and her home's value dropped. Now, she'd love to buy back the home for its current market price.
WHICH view is correct?
Ms. Cherry answers that question with a question: Does it matter? Moral hazard, she said, has been used to fend off solutions long enough.
''Let's assume that the guy who says, 'I paid my mortgage; why shouldn't she pay hers?' wins, right?'' Ms. Cherry said. ''Now what do we do? How is that a strategy for getting out of the problem that we're in?''

HEADLINE: G-20 Meeting Focuses on Euro Firewall Fund

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN and ANNIE LOWREY; Elisabeth Malkin reported from Mexico City, and Annie Lowrey from Washington.

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- As finance ministers from the Group of 20 countries began a two-day meeting here dominated by the European sovereign debt crisis, the United States was adamant that European nations must do more to buffer their economies.
At the center of the dispute is the reluctance of cash-rich economies like China and Japan to contribute new money to the International Monetary Fund without a commitment from European countries to expand their own stabilization fund first. The United States has said that it will not contribute new money to the I.M.F. 
The issue of that ''European firewall'' is dominating the discussions here among finance ministers and the heads of central banks of the leading economies.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said Saturday that although European countries had made progress over the past few months in averting a ''catastrophic financial failure,'' more work was needed to ''put in place a stronger, more credible firewall.''
Europe is constructing a permanent fund of 500 billion euros, or about $668 billion, called the European Stability Mechanism, which will be in place this summer. Euro ministers are expected to discuss whether to expand it to about $1 trillion in a meeting in early March.
The I.M.F. has announced plans to raise an additional $500 billion in lending resources, to help in Europe and elsewhere. But fund-raising has stalled, as the world waits to gauge the reaction from European officials.
Germany, for one, has indicated that it does not think the firewall should be made bigger at this point. There is concern that additional money might ease pressure on the more indebted countries in the euro zone, such as Spain and Italy, to pull back from commitments to undertake structural changes that will prove painful for their citizens. At the same time, any additional contribution by Germany would need public support at home.
With any resolution unlikely this weekend, countries are expected to continue talks on the firewall at the annual spring I.M.F. meeting in Washington.
The meetings come at the end of a week in which Europe and the I.M.F. approved a bailout plan for Greece of 130 billion euros, or about $173 billion, in return for a new round of austerity measures.
For the Mexican hosts, there was some irony in watching the Europeans wrangle over debt three decades after Mexico helped set off the Latin American debt crisis. After years of painful adjustment, Mexico's economy now has low debt, well-managed fiscal accounts and an inflation rate that is under control.
Mr. Geithner said that European action to shore up banks and rescue Greece had staved off the short-term crisis, but he warned that more needed to be done. ''It's important not to rest on that progress,'' he said, and to acknowledge that it was based ''in part on the expectation that there are more actions to come.''
In an interview, Angel Gurria, the secretary general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and a former finance minister of Mexico, argued that a very strong firewall was needed to prevent the debt crisis from spreading.
''Let's say a trillion from the Europeans, half a trillion from the I.M.F.,'' he said Friday. ''You put this kind of money together, and you announce that it's going to be there, ready to deal with anybody that wants to mess with any other country. I think you're never going to have to use it.''
Although the European debt crisis is at the center of talks here, countries are also expected to discuss efforts by the European Union and the United States to gain support for sanctions against Iran. The European Union will cut off Iranian oil imports beginning in July in order to put pressure on Tehran over its nuclear program.

HEADLINE: Ghastly Outdated Party

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
IT'S finally sinking in.
Republicans are getting queasy at the gruesome sight of their party eating itself alive, savaging the brand in ways that will long resonate.
''Republicans being against sex is not good,'' the G.O.P. strategist Alex Castellanos told me mournfully. ''Sex is popular.''
He said his party is ''coming to grips with a weaker field than we'd all want'' and going through the five stages of grief. ''We're at No. 4,'' he said. (Depression.) ''We've still got one to go.'' (Acceptance.) 
The contenders in the Hester Prynne primaries are tripping over one another trying to be the most radical, unreasonable and insane candidate they can be. They pounce on any traces of sanity in the other candidates -- be it humanity toward women, compassion toward immigrants or the willingness to make the rich pay a nickel more in taxes -- and try to destroy them with it.
President Obama has deranged conservatives just as W. deranged liberals. The right's image of Obama, though, is more a figment of its imagination than the left's image of W. was.
Newt Gingrich, a war wimp in Vietnam who supported W.'s trumped-up invasion of Iraq, had the gall to tell a crowd at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Okla., that defeating Obama -- ''the most dangerous president in modern American history'' -- was ''a duty of national security'' because ''he is incapable of defending the United States'' and because he ''wants to unilaterally weaken the United States.'' Who killed Osama again?
How can the warm, nurturing Catholic Church of my youth now be represented in the public arena by uncharitable nasties like Gingrich and Rick Santorum?
''It makes the party look like it isn't a modern party,'' Rudy Giuliani told CNN's Erin Burnett, fretting about the candidates' Cotton Mather attitude about women and gays. ''It doesn't understand the modern world that we live in.''
After a speech in Dallas on Thursday, Jeb Bush also recoiled: ''I used to be a conservative, and I watch these debates and I'm wondering, I don't think I've changed, but it's a little troubling sometimes when people are appealing to people's fears and emotion rather than trying to get them to look over the horizon for a broader perspective.''
Alan Simpson, the former Republican senator from Wyoming, recently called Santorum ''rigid and homophobic.'' Arlen Specter, who quit the Republicans to become a Democrat three years ago before Pennsylvania voters sent him home from the Senate, told MSNBC: ''Where you have Senator Santorum's views, so far to the right, with his attitude on women in the workplace and gays and the bestiality comments and birth control, I do not think it is realistic for Rick Santorum to represent America.'' That from the man who accused Anita Hill of perjury.
Republicans have a growing panic at the thought of going down the drain with a loser, missing their chance at capturing the Senate and giving back all those House seats won in 2010. More and more, they openly yearn for a fresh candidate, including Jeb Bush, who does, after all, have experience at shoplifting presidential victories at the last minute.
Their jitters increased exponentially as they watched Mitt belly-flop in his hometown on Friday, giving a dreadful rehash of his economic ideas in a virtually empty Ford Field in Detroit, babbling again about the ''right height'' of Michigan trees and blurting out that Ann ''drives a couple of Cadillacs.''
Romney's Richie Rich slips underscore what Ed Rollins, a Republican strategist, told the Ripon Forum: ''If we are only the party of Wall Street and country clubbers, we will quickly become irrelevant.''
Santorum, whose name aptly comes from the same Latin root as sanctimonious, went on Glenn Beck's Web-based show with his family and offered this lunacy: ''I understand why Barack Obama wants to send every kid to college,'' because colleges are ''indoctrination mills'' that ''harm'' the country. He evidently wants home university schooling, which will cut down on keggers.
His wife, Karen, suggested that her husband's success is ''God's will'' and that he wants ''to make the culture a better culture, more pleasing to God.''
The barking-mad Republicans of Virginia are helping to make the party look foolish and creepy. A video went viral on Friday in which Delegate Dave Albo comically regaled his fellow lawmakers on the floor of the Statehouse with his own Old Dominion version of ''Lysistrata'': he suggested that he was denied sex with his wife because of a Republican-sponsored bill that would have made ultrasounds, often with a vaginal probe, mandatory for women seeking abortions.
With music, red wine and a big-screen TV, he made a move on his wife, Rita, while she was watching a news report about the bill. ''And she looks at me and goes, 'I've got to go to bed,' '' Albo said as his colleagues guffawed.
The Republicans, with their crazed Reagan fixation, are a last-gasp party, living posthumously, fighting battles on sex, race, immigration and public education long ago won by the other side.
They're trying to roll back the clock, but time is passing them by.

HEADLINE: 'Attention Must Be Paid,' the Online Version

 BODY:
Willy Loman enters the digital age this month, as The New York Times kicks off an online series of discussions, interviews, video presentations and perhaps the occasional heated argument about Arthur Miller's ''Death of a Salesman,'' which opens on Broadway on March 15 in a new production starring Philip Seymour Hoffman. Here is a play that holds a special place in American culture. But why? We'll figure out the answers together over the next several weeks. 
Join in a conversation between two writers for The Times, the theater critic Charles Isherwood and the columnist Joe Nocera, about the play's relevance in a time of economic upheaval. Share with us recollections of your favorite Willy, the most moving Linda, the most boffo Biff you ever saw -- whether it was on Broadway or in your high school auditorium. We'll be talking to Mike Nichols, the veteran director who is in charge of the new production, and we'll be hearing from contemporary playwrights discussing Miller's importance to their work and to the American theater. Above all we hope the series will inspire everyone to engage with this classic text with fresh eyes. If you want to dig up that dusty copy from the shelf, or download a new one, please do.
The conversations begin on March 1 on ArtsBeat: nytimes.com/artsbeat.

HEADLINE: Back to First Principles On Religious Freedom

BYLINE: By DOROTHY SAMUELS

 BODY:
Catholic bishops, leading Republicans and other social conservatives persist in portraying the Obama administration's new rule requiring employer health plans to cover birth control without a co-pay as an assault on religious freedom.
But the real departure from the Constitution is their specious claim to a right to impose their religious views on millions of Americans who do not share them. Virtually all American women, including Catholic women, use contraceptives sometime in their lives. In essence, the bishops and their allies are arguing that they are above the law and their beliefs should be elevated over pressing societal interests.
The political ruckus over the issue has tended to obscure a central fact: the legal case against the policy is remarkably weak. The contraception benefit is plainly constitutional and a proper exercise of government power under Supreme Court precedent and a federal law dealing with exercise of religion. 
As with other church-state disputes, the starting point is the text of the First Amendment, which says, ''Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'' The nation's founders were seeking a protective balance, one that gave wide berth to religious belief but drew a line at government entanglement with religion or favoring one faith over another.
Deciding the proper balance in individual cases can be hard. However, by applying existing law and precedent, judges should have little trouble dismissing the argument that President Obama trampled on the religious freedom of employers like hospitals and universities with religious affiliations by having insurance companies provide free contraceptive coverage to the institutions' employees.
Insupportable claims of religious infringement are being made in other contexts, too. Religious service providers say it is religious discrimination to deny them government contracts to help human-trafficking victims or arrange adoptions because of their unwillingness to provide emergency contraception or stop discriminating against qualified gay couples.
Several lawsuits challenging the contraception rule have already been filed, and two main legal elements come into play: the Supreme Court's 1990 ruling in Employment Division v. Smith and the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act (R.F.R.A.), which Congress passed in response to that ruling.
The Smith decision, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, involved two workers who sought unemployment benefits after they were fired for using peyote, an illegal drug. The court found that Oregon could deny the benefits -- even though the workers said their use of peyote was part of a religious ritual -- under the general principle that Oregon's ban on peyote was a ''valid and neutral law of general applicability.''
The justices said the First Amendment's protections do not mean individuals are free to violate valid laws simply by claiming a sincere religious objection. To ''make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land'' would have the anarchic effect of permitting ''every citizen to become a law unto himself,'' Justice Scalia wrote. The court said the state could exempt religious peyote use from drug laws, but was not constitutionally required to do so. Under the Smith case, the administration policy on contraceptive coverage is clearly constitutional: it is a neutral regulation enacted with no motive to discriminate against religious interests.
The R.F.R.A. statute, however, uses a far stricter standard. Any federal government actions that ''substantially burden a person's exercise of religion,'' it says, must advance a compelling interest and be the least restrictive means of doing so. Even under that test, the new contraceptives policy should survive legal challenge. It clearly advances the government's compelling interest in promoting women's health and autonomy, and broad participation is the least restrictive way to carry out a complicated national health reform.
But courts should not even reach that question since the provision of preventive services without a co-pay does not interfere with a religious practice or ceremony. There is no impediment to the exercise of religion, especially since the administration has revised its original rule, which exempted churches, mosques and other houses of worship -- and now also relieves colleges, hospitals, charities and other religiously affiliated groups from having to provide contraceptive coverage directly. The rule does not interfere with church governance, prevent anyone from voicing opposition, or force anyone to use contraceptives in violation of religious beliefs.
The administration's decision to put the burden on insurance companies to offer women contraceptives free of charge to accommodate the objections of religious employers was a retreat under pressure. But that move made the policy even less susceptible to any plausible constitutional attack.
Opponents of the contraception rule claim the fight isn't about birth control, but religious liberty. It's about both, though they are right that the battle for religious exemptions goes well beyond birth control coverage -- to employment discrimination, zoning, mandated reporting of child abuse, a pharmacist's duty to fill valid prescriptions and that of hospitals to give life-saving emergency care. And now, the bishops and conservative religious groups are lobbying to get Congress to pass a law that would let any private employer opt out of covering any medical treatment as a matter of faith. That is an outrageous assault on the First Amendment.

HEADLINE: A Million Jobs

 BODY:
The American economy was terrifyingly close to the brink in 2008 and 2009, and the impending collapse of General Motors and Chrysler threatened to be the final push. When the companies begged the federal government to save them from financial catastrophe, President George W. Bush and later President Obama ignored strong Republican objections, saving a signature American industry and the whole country from an even deeper crash.
Four years later, there are 1.45 million people who are working as a direct result of the $80 billion bailout, according to the nonpartisan Center for Automotive Research, both at the carmakers and associated businesses downstream in the economy. Michigan's unemployment level is at its lowest level in three years. G.M. is again the world's biggest automaker, and both companies are reporting substantial profits. 
And yet Mitt Romney, along with the other Republican presidential candidates, has spent the days before the Michigan primary denouncing the bailout that has rescued his native state. Mr. Romney has been especially vociferous in his insistence that he would have allowed the carmakers to go bankrupt, and said he believes they could somehow have clawed their way back to profitability without a dollar of federal assistance.
''The president tells us that without his intervention things in Detroit would be worse,'' he wrote recently in The Detroit News. ''I believe that without his intervention things there would be better.''
This critique is detached from reality. Steven Rattner, who was Mr. Obama's lead auto adviser, wrote in The Times on Friday that not a single dollar of private capital could be found to prop up the companies, despite desperate efforts, and he challenged Mr. Romney to name one investor who might differ. The Detroit News, which otherwise enthusiastically endorsed Mr. Romney in the primary, said he was dead wrong about the bailout. Only the government was in a position to save the auto industry from ''the darkest hour of its history,'' the newspaper's editorial board wrote.
Mr. Romney slid into this quicksand in 2008 with an Op-Ed essay in The Times arguing against government help for Detroit. It included the memorable prediction that if the bailout were granted, ''you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye.'' Having been criticized for his inconsistency on so many other issues, he apparently feels he cannot back away from this one -- no matter that his argument has proved so wrong.
These days he has added a new trope: union-bashing. He is now calling the bailout ''crony capitalism'' because it was designed to save union jobs. He charges that Mr. Obama used the Treasury to help his political allies. ''While a lot of workers and investors got the short end of the stick, Obama's union allies -- and his major campaign contributors -- reaped reward upon reward, all on the taxpayer's dime,'' he wrote earlier this month.
High labor costs were undeniably part of Detroit's problems. But his claim that the government did not do nearly enough to drive those costs down in the bailout is just flat-out wrong. Labor made substantial concessions.
After earlier agreeing to let newly hired workers make half the wage of current employees, unions consented in the bailout deal to give up cost-of-living increases, dental coverage, and some vacation benefits and work rules. Unions also took the gamble of accepting a company stock fund to pay for their health benefits, instead of cash.
Mr. Romney is oblivious to those givebacks, expressing anger that a health care fund for nearly half a million United Automobile Workers retirees (''union-boss controlled'') got a higher priority in the bailout than lenders to Chrysler.
In a speech on Friday, he continued to insist that the U.A.W. and federal fuel-economy standards were somehow imperiling the future of the industry, even though neither seems to have halted the carmakers' current success.
Neither Mr. Romney nor any of the Republican candidates are able to admit that sometimes only the government can rescue a major sector of the economy. Any autoworker, however, can explain it to them.

HEADLINE: Growing Support for Drug Testing of Welfare Recipients

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) -- Conservatives who say welfare recipients should have to pass a drug test to receive government assistance have momentum on their side.
The issue has come up in the Republican presidential campaign, with Mitt Romney calling it an ''excellent idea.'' 
Nearly two dozen states are considering measures that would make drug testing mandatory for welfare recipients, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Wyoming lawmakers advanced such a proposal last week.
Driving the measures is a perception that people on public assistance are misusing the money and that cutting off their benefits would save money for tight state budgets -- even as statistics have largely proved both notions untrue.
''The idea from Joe Taxpayer is, 'I don't mind helping you out, but you need to show that you're looking for work, or better yet that you're employed, and that you're drug and alcohol free,' '' said Edward A. Buchanan, a Republican who is the speaker of the Wyoming House.
Supporters are pushing the measures despite warnings that courts have struck down similar programs, ruling that the plans amount to an unconstitutional search of people who have done nothing more than seek help.
''This legislation assumes suspicion on this group of people,'' State Representative W. Patrick Goggles, a Democrat, said during a debate on the Wyoming measure late Thursday. ''It assumes that they're drug abusers.''
About three dozen states have taken up such measures over the years. But the idea has prompted political debates across the nation as lawmakers seek new ways to fight off the effects of the recession.
This year, conservative legislators in 23 states -- including Mississippi, where lawmakers want the random screenings to include a test for nicotine -- are moving forward with proposals.
Mr. Romney, in an interview this month in Georgia, supported the idea. ''People who are receiving welfare benefits, government benefits, we should make sure they're not using those benefits to pay for drugs,'' Mr. Romney said to WXIA-TV in Atlanta.
One of his rivals, Newt Gingrich, addressed the topic with Yahoo News in November, saying he considered testing a way to curb drug use and lower costs to public programs.
''It could be through testing before you get any kind of federal aid -- unemployment compensation, food stamps, you name it,'' Mr. Gingrich said.
In Idaho, budget analysts concluded last year that such a testing program would cost more than it would save, prompting lawmakers to drop the idea.
Recent federal statistics indicate that welfare recipients are no more likely than the general population to abuse drugs. Data show that about 8 percent of people use drugs illegally. Before a random drug testing program in Michigan was suspended by a court challenge, about 8 percent of its public assistance applicants tested positive.

HEADLINE: Romney Braces For A Long Haul

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY; Jim Rutenberg reported from Troy, Mich., and Jeff Zeleny from Washington. Robert Pear contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
TROY, Mich. -- Whether Mitt Romney wins or loses the Michigan and Arizona primaries on Tuesday, his advisers are warning donors and other supporters to prepare for a longer, more bruising and more expensive fight for the Republican presidential nomination that may not be settled until at least May.
That is prompting a new round of intensified fund-raising by his financial team, which had hoped by this point to be collecting money for a general election match with President Obama. The campaign is increasingly trying to quell anxiety among Republican leaders, while intently focusing on the mechanics of accumulating delegates needed to secure the nomination.
Mr. Romney's aides said they were confident their sustained attacks portraying Rick Santorum as a Washington insider, and Mr. Santorum's shaky debate performance in Arizona on Wednesday, had slowed their rival's recent surge here in Michigan. 
But Mr. Romney is by no means in the clear, they said, as he fights to avert a loss in the state where he was born and raised -- and where less than three weeks ago he was expected to win handily, before Mr. Santorum's surprise triumphs in Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri.
Regardless of the results Tuesday, Mr. Santorum is preparing to fight on for weeks or months, enticed by new rules that award delegates in early primaries and caucuses based on each candidate's share of votes. ''The race is going to go a long time,'' he said after addressing a meeting here of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group.
The party's new delegate system is a major contributor to the prolonged nature of the contest, along with the advent of supportive and well-financed ''super PACs'' that have helped Mr. Romney's competitors stay in the delegate hunt when their candidacies might otherwise have withered without enough cash.
For many Republicans, the question is not just whether Mr. Romney will eventually capture the nomination, but at what cost.
There is a growing sense among party leaders that the primary fight has gone on long enough and that continued attacks by the candidates and their allies have steered the conversation away from the economy and could damage the party's prospects in the fall.
As Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum traded a new round of sharp charges in Michigan on Saturday, some Republican leaders expressed concern about the effects of a prolonged and nasty primary fight.
''The general election prospects for Republicans certainly would be better served if more focus was spent on Obama's policies and the failures of those policies,'' said Haley Barbour, the former governor of Mississippi and a longtime party leader. ''There's still time for that, but it would improve our prospects greatly.''
Mr. Barbour was speaking at the winter meeting of the National Governors Association in Washington, where the presidential race and the alarm over its intense negativity were central topics.
Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, who endorsed Mr. Romney, said he was disappointed by the acrimony that had overshadowed plans to create jobs and lift the economy. ''That's what citizens care about,'' he said. ''They don't like all the bickering. It does not add value.''
Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana said it had fed his fears that ''our side might not offer a bold enough and specific enough and constructive enough -- and I would say inclusive enough -- alternative.'' He said the Republican race would almost certainly not be settled by May 8, the date of the primary in his state.
Indeed, Mr. Romney's campaign has warned donors and supporters that even with his victories in the coming contests, the Republican competition may very well last until at least the middle of May. They said the situation did not indicate diminishing prospects for Mr. Romney but rather was the result of the party's delegate-allocation rules and the additional time those require for any candidate to accumulate the 1,144 delegates necessary to secure the nomination.
The acknowledgment that the intraparty competition will most likely continue into the spring would seem to sweep aside the Romney campaign's hope that it could string together a series of early victories sufficient to claim the nominee's mantle -- symbolically, at least -- and begin focusing exclusively on Mr. Obama.
Mr. Romney's victories have come in fits and starts, leaving the party facing chatter about a contested convention this summer in Tampa, Fla., if none of the candidates have won the 1,144 delegates needed.
Gov. Paul R. LePage of Maine raised it as a possibility again in an interview on Saturday, saying that the current candidates had ''injured themselves'' and the party through their negativity and that delegates to the Republican National Convention should ''pick a fresh face.'' (Mr. Daniels, frequently mentioned as such a possible contender, unequivocally declared he would not do so on Saturday.)
Even as Mr. Santorum appealed to conservatives for support in Michigan on Saturday, his allies were already advertising on his behalf in the next round of states to vote, another indication of how the candidates are planning to keep trading punches no matter what the outcome is on Tuesday.
In interviews, Mr. Romney's aides and supporters dismissed that notion of a new entrant, and said their campaign was built to go the distance if necessary.
''We're just going to have to work a little harder, and this team will do it,'' said Mel Sembler, a member of Mr. Romney's finance team, adding that it would be ''ready to supply whatever he needs to win this primary'' campaign.
''We're all on the telephone again,'' he said, ''and we're getting it done. It's just going to take longer.''
Reflecting the unsettled outlook, aides to both Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum are playing down the importance of the Michigan and Arizona primaries. Those contests are preludes to the biggest day of voting in the Republican campaign on March 6, with 10 states and 437 delegates at play on Super Tuesday.
That terrain is far less hospitable to Mr. Romney than Michigan and Arizona, particularly a swath of Southern states, where polls suggest that he is trailing Mr. Santorum and Newt Gingrich. Mr. Gingrich is aggressively trying to revive his candidacy on Super Tuesday in Georgia, the state he represented in Congress.
Here in Michigan, some Republican leaders suggested that the time had come for the party to rally around one candidate, however imperfect.
''I don't have that spark behind any one candidate at the moment,'' said Anna Mouser, the Republican chairwoman in Grand Traverse County. ''But we do need to decide on our nominee. Some of these primaries are dragging out months and months and months, which leaves little time to raise money, unite and go out and defeat the Democrats.''

HEADLINE: 'Salesman' Comes Calling, Right on Time

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
THERE is never a wrong time to take a fresh look at a great work of art. But some moments are riper than others for re-encountering plays in particular, which are most fully alive when they are onstage, and then retreat to the bookshelves -- or digital form, today -- when they are not being performed. The current moment could hardly be more opportune for another wrenching rendezvous with Willy Loman, the American dreamer fighting a losing battle with fortune in Arthur Miller's ''Death of a Salesman.''
More than a decade after the last Broadway revival, Philip Seymour Hoffman takes up the burden of Willy's sample cases and the doubts, fears and dreams spilling out of them, in a new production directed by Mike Nichols and co-starring Linda Emond and Andrew Garfield, opening March 15 at the Barrymore Theater. 
Nobody doesn't know ''Death of a Salesman,'' of course. It may be the first play you read in high school, or even appeared in in high school, as Mr. Hoffman did, playing Willy. (Somehow it's not hard to picture a teenage Mr. Hoffman bent down by care, schlepping those cases onstage.) Regular revivals on Broadway as well as in regional and amateur theaters have made it one of a small handful of gold-plated stage classics that have practically become a part of the collective psyche.
But the sharp economic downturn that followed the bursting of the housing bubble, and the discovery of the dubious financial practices behind it, casts a revivifying new light on the plight of the Loman family. In both its small details -- paying off a mortgage after 25 hard years is a plot point -- and its implied questions about the hollowness of some cherished American ideals, the play feels unusually, perhaps unhappily, timely.
In this spirit, over the next few weeks The New York Times is presenting a series of online discussions and interactive forums on the ArtsBeat blog that will explore the play and its contexts -- then and now -- with American playwrights, artists involved in the coming production, and readers. (More details are here.)
In an essay written for The Times on the first anniversary of the play's 1949 opening, Miller described Willy's tragedy, in ringing tones, as that of ''a man who did believe that he alone was not meeting the qualifications laid down for mankind by those clean-shaven frontiersmen who inhabit the peaks of broadcasting and advertising offices.'' Hearing the ''thundering command to succeed'' he found himself with no recourse but ''to stare in the mirror at a failure.''
With employment continuing to lag and millions of homes in foreclosure, there are surely many men and women avoiding the mirror and its accusations, believing, like Willy, that their inability to achieve the golden ideal of financial success is somehow a personal indictment. In the more than half-century since the play opened the compulsion to measure a man's worth by the size of his paycheck has probably become only more pronounced in American culture.
The ethos of the banker-gods and C.E.O.'s set the overriding cultural tone for much of the last 30 years, as the salaries of leading company executives have skyrocketed, figures like Donald Trump and Warren Buffett have become national luminaries, and the care and tending of the stock market became not just a primary priority of the government but an obsession of the average American too, endlessly exposed to the gyrations of the markets via cable and network news channels.
The economic collapse -- the Great Recession, it has come to be called -- has ignited a prickly questioning of these priorities. The Occupy Wall Street movement has brought an intensified focus on the growing inequities in the economy and the dubious practices of the bankers so recently seen as worship-worthy titans, if not oracles. I expect there will be particularly hearty chuckles greeting a line I had forgotten from the play. When Willy is boasting to his brother that his sons are ''fearless characters,'' his neighbor Charley wryly comments, ''Willy, the jails are full of fearless characters.''
Willy's brother Ben then chimes in, with a laugh: ''And the stock exchange, friend.''
The Great Depression was the formative event in Miller's young life. In a 1958 speech, later printed in Harper's magazine, he called it ''the ground upon which I learned to stand.'' Born in 1915, he was the son of first-generation immigrants. His father became a successful manufacturer of women's coats, and during Miller's early years the family lived in splendor, in a town house in a neighborhood of Harlem populated by prosperous Jewish families. But Miller's father had invested much of his money in the stock market, and when the crash came in 1929, the family was cast into comparative poverty, moving from their plush town house to a small house in Brooklyn.
The character of Willy was most closely modeled on an uncle, Miller said, but his father's precipitous fall from affluence to abjection, and his restless attempts over the years to re-establish himself in business, surely find an echo in Willy's desperate determination to make himself into the success in the eyes of the world that he cannot stop imagining himself to be.
Aside from its implicit critique of the notion of valuing a man's life by the rung he occupies on the ladder of commerce, other elements in the play resonate freshly today. Among the most famous phrases, recurring in the dialogue almost like an incantation, is Willy's fervid emphasis on the importance of being ''well liked,'' once again using a quantitative measure to establish a human being's inherent value. His son Biff, Willy asserts, will inevitably rise in the world, despite the moral failings they both swat away like pesky gnats, because he is ''well liked,'' not merely ''liked,'' as is Charley's studious son Bernard.
Thanks to the explosion in social media, being ''well liked'' has become practically a profession in itself. Adults as well as teenagers keep assiduous count of their Facebook friends and Twitter followers, and surely are inwardly if not outwardly measuring their worth by the rise or fall of the number. People are turning themselves into products, both for profit and for pleasure, and the inevitable temptation is to equate the popularity of your brand with your fundamental self-worth.
Many of us are willingly become versions of Willy Loman, forever on the road -- that is, online -- selling ourselves and advertising our lifestyles: describing the meal we just consumed at a restaurant (with uploaded photograph of course) or the trip we're planning to take. A social-media gadfly (or, say, me) might suggest that there are vestiges of Willy's tormenting self-doubt in the need to advertise every moment of our life so assiduously, as if constant Facebook updates could vanquish the inner voice whispering in Willy's ear that his life is built on sand.
Of course it is hardly necessary to consider the social and economic developments that are mirrored or prefigured in the drama to emerge provoked by a viewing of ''Death of a Salesman.'' It has become an established classic not just in America but on the world's stages. (Miller himself directed a production in China in 1983.) It succeeded despite the contemporary complacency of postwar America -- when it was attacked from forces on the right as ill-disguised Communist propaganda from a confirmed lefty -- just as it will likely succeed in attracting audiences today who can relate to Willy's struggle to maintain a foothold in the upward-striving American middle class. (Although at more than $100 a ticket, sadly, Broadway has priced itself out of the market of a lot of middle-class Americans.)
The play moves us on any number of levels, perhaps most fundamentally as a mid-century American version of that classic dramatic archetype dating back to the Greeks: the family in mortal conflict with itself. The Loman family's conspiracy to support Willy in his delusions -- at least until Biff decides he has to destroy his father's illusions to save himself -- is drawn from true filial and marital love, and it is in observing how little this love can do to save Willy that the play is most devastating. He is too consumed by the belief that his failure to succeed, and to inculcate success in his sons, has somehow disqualified him for full membership in the human race.
Despite Willy's delusions and moral evasions, Miller always insisted on the nobility in his struggle. ''The play is really about mortality and leaving something behind,'' he told The Times during an interview on the occasion of the Chinese production. ''Willy Loman is trying to write his name on a cake of ice on a hot July day.'' His contradictions and his failings are all human and all common, which is why the hallucinatory last day of his life will always retain the power to command not just our pity but our respect too.

HEADLINE: Points Lose Favor

BYLINE: By VICKIE ELMER

 BODY:
WITH interest rates at or near record lows, many borrowers are seeing little reason to pay points when buying or refinancing a home. Some are even opting for what's known as ''negative points,'' agreeing to a slightly higher rate to help pay closing costs.
The trend away from points, which buy down the interest rate in exchange for an upfront fee, partly reflects borrower sentiment that rates are already low enough, the industry experts say. 
In New York and other areas with a mobile population, many people avoid mortgages with points, because they know they won't be staying put long enough to break even on the costs, which typically takes five to seven years, according to Norman Calvo, the president of Universal Mortgage, a mortgage broker in Brooklyn.
''If you're young and buying your first apartment,'' Mr. Calvo said, ''chances are you're going to be moving on.''
Only about 5 percent of Universal's customers pay points, he said. Nationwide, 32 percent of loans for purchases had paid points in December, down from 47 percent in December 2008, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
A point equals 1 percent of the loan amount, so paying one point on a $250,000 refinancing costs an extra $2,500 at closing, atop other mortgage fees, taxes and escrow amounts. Paying a point usually reduces the interest rate by 0.25 points over its term, so for instance instead of 4 percent, the rate is 3.75 percent.
The average number of points paid in 2011, according to a Freddie Mac survey, was 0.7 percentage points, less than half the levels people paid in the 1990s. The average has been 0.7 percent for three years, after it hit a low of 0.4 percent in 2007; in 1995 it averaged 1.8 percent, according to Freddie Mac data.
The chief advantage to paying points is you lower your rate and your monthly payment based on a one-time charge, said Neil Diamond, a mortgage banker with Legacy Real Estate in Commack, N.Y. Your mortgage professional should take time to find out what works for your circumstances, then structure the loan and fees and commission accordingly, he said.
So how do you know if paying points is worthwhile? There are two key considerations: how long you plan to live in a home, and how much you can afford in closing costs.
Many mortgage professionals suggest a rule of thumb on living in a home for at least five years to reap the savings. Others suggest doing an analysis of your financial goals, along with a direct comparison of no-point and point mortgages. Once you've filled out a mortgage application, ask for good-faith estimates on both options, said Chanda Gaither, a housing counselor with La Casa de Don Pedro, which works on affordable housing and neighborhood development in Newark.
People should also consider how much cash they have in reserve for emergencies and unexpected housing costs, Ms. Gaither said; that may be more important than a slightly lower rate.
Sometimes a seller will offer to pay a point or two on the mortgage as a concession. But, ''with rates as low as they are, people are not coming out of their pockets to pay for points,'' especially for refinancings, said Russell Tucker, a senior vice president of Investors Home Mortgage in Short Hills, N.J.
Some borrowers, meanwhile, go for negative points, which is also called a lender rebate or points in reverse. In exchange for accepting a higher rate, the lender agrees to give the borrower a credit, which is usually used for closing costs.
Mr. Calvo says these rebates can be ''a really, really great option'' to defray costs, especially for larger mortgages. He said he recently closed a $2 million loan on which the borrower agreed to accept a rate of 4.75 percent, instead of 4.5 percent, in exchange for a $20,000 credit in closing costs.

HEADLINE: In Letter, Buffett Says a Successor at Berkshire Is Lined Up

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
It has long been one of Wall Street's favorite guessing games: Who will succeed Warren E. Buffett as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway?
Mr. Buffett, in his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders on Saturday, said for the first time that he had chosen a successor. But Mr. Buffett, 81, did not name the candidate, and emphasized that he and his longtime business partner, the 88-year-old Charlie Munger, were sticking around.
''Do not, however, infer from this discussion that Charlie and I are going anywhere; we continue to be in excellent health, and we love what we do,'' wrote Mr. Buffett, who over five decades has built Berkshire, based in Omaha, into one of America's largest companies.
By signaling a clear succession plan, Mr. Buffett hopes to reassure investors who have expressed concern over Berkshire's future leadership. Berkshire's share performance has lagged the broader stock market over the last two years, and Wall Street analysts partly blame the uncertainty surrounding a new chief executive. 
It was only a year ago that Berkshire disclosed in a securities filing that it had identified four current managers ''who are capable of being C.E.O.'' But just weeks after that filing, David Sokol, a top lieutenant of Mr. Buffett whom many considered the front-runner, resigned when he was accused of violating the company's insider trading policies.
Mr. Sokol's departure, a major embarrassment for Mr. Buffett, went unmentioned in the letter. But he praised the work of several executives who are thought to be leading candidates to succeed him as chief, including Ajit Jain, the head of the company's reinsurance operations; Tad Montross, chief of the insurance business General Re; and Matthew Rose at the railroad unit Burlington Northern Santa Fe.
Beyond succession issues, the 22-page letter delved into the performance of Berkshire's vast holdings, providing insights into the country's business prospects.
''In short, when you look at Berkshire, you are looking across corporate America,'' wrote Mr. Buffett, whose net worth is about $50 billion, according to Forbes magazine.
With a market capitalization of about $200 billion, Berkshire ranks among the top 10 most valuable companies in the United States, roughly the same size as General Electric and Google. The conglomerate has holdings large and small, like the giant utility MidAmerican Energy and the modest confectioner See's Candies.
Berkshire on Saturday reported net income last year of about $10.3 billion, which was off 21 percent from 2010. The company's book value, or net worth - Mr. Buffett's preferred yardstick for performance - increased 4.6 percent, outpacing the broader stock market's 2.1 percent return.
Among the assets that dragged on Berkshire's performance were its holdings in the housing sector, which include the homebuilder Clayton Homes, the carpet maker Shaw, and Acme Brick.
''Last year, I told you that 'a housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so,' '' wrote Mr. Buffett. ''I was dead wrong.''
He said that housing remained in a depression and was ''the major reason a recovery in employment has so severely lagged the steady and substantial comeback we have seen in almost all other sectors of our economy.''
''Wise monetary and fiscal policies play an important role in tempering recessions, but these tools don't create households nor eliminate excess housing units,'' Mr. Buffett added. ''Fortunately, demographics and our market system will restore the needed balance - probably before long.''
Only then, Mr. Buffett said, will home building pick up and unemployment substantially drop.
Many Wall Street investors pay the closest attention to Berkshire's roughly $100 billion in stock and bond holdings. The stock portfolio's biggest change in 2011 was Mr. Buffett's $11 billion investment in International Business Machines, a purchase that gave Berkshire a 5.5 percent stake in the technology giant.
''As was the case with Coca-Cola in 1988 and the railroads in 2006, I was late to the I.B.M. party,'' Mr. Buffett said. ''I have been reading the company's annual report for more than 50 years, but it wasn't until a Saturday in March last year that my thinking crystallized. As Thoreau said, 'It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.' ''
Last August, Mr. Buffett also made a $5 billion investment in the preferred shares of Bank of America, a vote of confidence for the struggling financial institution. On Saturday, Mr. Buffett said the banking industry was ''back on its feet.''
At Bank of America, Mr. Buffett said that ''some huge mistakes were made by prior management'' but that its current chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, ''has made excellent progress in cleaning these up, though the completion of that process will take a number of years.''
In his annual dispatch, Mr. Buffett steered clear of the tax-reform debate. In recent months, he made as many headlines in Washington as he did on Wall Street, inserting himself into the debate over whether the United States government should raise taxes on the wealthy. In an opinion article in The New York Times, Mr. Buffett told Congress to stop ''coddling'' him and other affluent Americans. He called on lawmakers to increase their taxes and close loopholes to address the soaring budget deficit.
He said in the article that his tax rate of 17 percent was a lower percentage than the rate paid by anyone else in his office, including his secretary.
The White House seized upon Mr. Buffett's piece. President Obama has made ''the Buffett Rule'' - a mandate that millionaires pay at least 30 percent of their incomes in taxes - a focus of his efforts to overhaul the tax code. Mr. Buffett's secretary, Debbie Bosanek, sat in Michelle Obama's box at the State of the Union address last month.
He remains at the center of the tax-reform debate. Last week, in a television interview on CNN, Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, said that Mr. Buffett should ''just write a check and shut up.''
Mr. Buffett has said that when he dies, Berkshire will split his job into three parts - a chief executive, a non-executive chairman and several investment managers of its large stock and bond portfolio. Late last year, he said that his son Howard Buffett would succeed him as non-executive chairman.
On the money-management side of the business, Mr. Buffett highlighted in his letter his recent hiring of two previously unheralded money managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, to help oversee his $77 billion stock portfolio.
''Both of these men have outstanding investment skills,'' Mr. Buffett wrote. ''Each will be handling a few billion dollars in 2012, but they have the brains, judgment and character to manage our entire portfolio when Charlie and I are no longer running Berkshire.''
He said that Mr. Combs had already built a $1.75 billion portfolio, and Mr. Weschler would soon create one of a similar size.
''Both Ted and Todd will be helpful to the next C.E.O. of Berkshire in making acquisitions,'' Mr. Buffett wrote. ''They have excellent 'business minds' that grasp the economic forces likely to determine the future of a wide variety of businesses. They are aided in their thinking by an understanding of what is predictable and what is unknowable.''
In searching for clues into Mr. Buffett's successor, the letter perhaps heaped the most explicit praise on Mr. Jain, the head of Berkshire's large reinsurance business. Mr. Jain, 60, is a native of India who graduated from Harvard Business School and worked at the consulting firm McKinsey earlier in his career. He has worked for Berkshire for more than two decades.
''His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, most importantly, brains in a manner that is unique in the insurance business,'' Mr. Buffett wrote. ''Charlie would gladly trade me for a second Ajit. Alas, there is none.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Syrian Conflict Poses the Risk Of Wider Strife

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Reporting was contributed by Tim Arango from Baghdad; Ethan Bronner from Jerusalem; Michael Wines from Beijing; David M. Herszenhorn from Moscow; Thom Shanker, Eric Schmitt and Mark Landler from Washington; Adam Nossiter from Dakar, Senegal; John F. Burns from London; Nicholas Kulish from Berlin; and Dan Bilefsky and Scott Sayare from Paris.

 BODY:
PARIS -- More than a year after it began, the Arab awakening has had its seasons. After a world-shaking spring, then on through summer, autumn and winter, one country after another -- Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen -- has toppled autocrats, with varying amounts of blood. Some governments have stamped out revolts, like Bahrain. Others have tried modest reforms, like Morocco, or idled on the sidelines (think Algeria and Saudi Arabia).
Now it is nearly spring again, and there is Syria.
As the dead pile up and diplomacy fails to stem the violence, it is clear that this conflict is unique in significant ways, difficult to predict and far riskier to the world. Unlike Libya, Syria is of strategic importance, sitting at the center of ethnic, religious and regional rivalries that give it the potential to become a whirlpool that draws in powers, great and small, in the region and beyond. 
''Syria is almost the only country where the so-called Arab Spring could change the geostrategic concept of the region,'' said Olivier Roy, a French historian of the Middle East. He offered as a counterexample Egypt and Tunisia, where new leaders seemed to be keeping similar alliances and geopolitical positions. ''But in Syria,'' Mr. Roy said, ''if the regime is toppled, we have a totally new landscape.''
Many consider the conflict another inevitable revolution that will eventually overthrow President Bashar al-Assad. But in the months since Syrians revolted -- and as Mr. Assad has unleashed his army against them -- the country has already become a proxy fight for larger powers in the region and beyond.
For decades, Syria was the linchpin of the old security order in the Middle East. It allowed the Russians and Iranians to extend their influence even as successive Assad governments provided predictability for Washington and a stable border for Israel, despite support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian territories.
But the burgeoning civil war in Syria has upset that paradigm, placing the Russians and Americans and their respective allies on opposite sides. It is a conflict that has sharply escalated sectarian tensions between Shiites and Sunnis and between Iran and Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf nations. And it has left Israel hopeful that an enemy will fall, but deeply concerned about who might take control of his arsenal.
''What makes Syria so much more complicated than Libya is that the strategic issues are as prominent as the moral ones,'' said Anne-Marie Slaughter, a Princeton professor and until recently the director of policy planning at the State Department.
''Syria couldn't be more strategically located, and the prospect of letting a full-fledged civil war erupt is incredibly dangerous,'' she said, adding that it would become a proxy war between the gulf states and Saudi Arabia against Iran. ''And then Israel is in there, too.''
Washington is keenly aware of the larger forces at play and of the dangers of another military intervention in an Arab country.
''It's an arena right now for all of the various interests to play out,'' said Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in an interview on CNN. ''Turkey clearly has an interest, a very important interest. Russia has a very important interest. Iran has an interest.''
For Russia, the fall of Mr. Assad, an ally and arms customer, would further diminish its influence in the region. If Mr. Assad goes, any new government will note Russia's support for him, including a steady supply of weapons. Arabs across the region, who are demanding their rights and freedoms, may resent it, too.
''Even switching sides at this point won't help,'' said Dmitry Gorenburg, a Russia scholar with the Center for Naval Analyses, a federally financed research group based in Virginia.
For the United States, the conflict is a bundle of risks and contradictions that has made Washington's stance -- frustrating those who favor a more robust intervention -- far more cautious than it was in Libya.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has called any comparison of Syria to Libya a ''false analogy.'' In the largest sense, Libya could be seen as a strategic sideshow, on the edge of the Arab awakening, while Syria is quite clearly at center stage. Mr. Assad's crackdown, which has killed at least 6,000 civilians, has seized international attention and presented a vexing moral dilemma about intervention.
If the responsibility to protect civilians is a legitimate new part of international law, why would it apply to Libya and not to Syria? Why shouldn't the world intervene in what is already a one-sided civil war? Without a robust intervention, what happens to the momentum and principles of the Arab Spring? Will Western calls for democracy and equal rights suffer and help radical Islamists rise to power?
For Washington, Europe and the Sunnis of Saudi Arabia and the gulf, the impact on Iran is as important as the fate of Mr. Assad. Syria is one of Iran's closest allies. It was nearly alone in supporting Iran, not Iraq, in their war in the 1980s. Syria is Iran's main conduit to supply aid and weapons to Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
Mr. Assad's fall would be a major defeat for Iran, so it is giving his government money, arms and advice, say intelligence officials of two Western countries.
The United States and Europe -- with tenuous Russian and Chinese support -- have isolated Iran economically and diplomatically to try to forestall Tehran from being able to build a nuclear weapon. The conflict in Syria complicates that delicate diplomacy, but a new Syrian government could be a greater blow to Iranian influence than any sanction the West has mustered so far. It could also revive democratic protests in Iran.
But the administration is ruling out direct military intervention in this conflict. After a decade of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a limited intervention in Libya that was harshly criticized by Republicans, President Obama wants no new military adventure in an election year. Nor does the Pentagon, especially given Syria's integrated air defense system, supplied by Russia.
Not least, American officials point out the murky nature and incoherence of the armed opposition to Mr. Assad and note that the Free Syrian Army, formed by exiled Syrian Army officers, defectors and militias, does not control significant territory in Syria where arms could be supplied.
For now, the administration has no intention to arm Syrian opposition groups, despite public advocacy by two senior Republican senators for such a course. Some light weapons are getting to the rebels, mostly through Jordan and Lebanon, but not enough to make a significant difference.
Pentagon officials said planners had been asked to look at a range of military options for Syria, but they anticipated no American involvement. Of course, they said the same for Libya, until the White House changed course.
Of the many combustible dynamics involved in the crisis in Syria, the Sunni-Shiite schism is one of the most potent. Mr. Assad's government is dominated by the minority Alawites, whose sect is an offshoot of Shiite Islam. The Iranians are Shiites, as are the leaders in Iraq. The Saudis and most of the gulf states are Sunnis. So are many extremist groups, like Al Qaeda, which view the conflict with their own, complicating agendas.
There is some evidence that Sunni radicals are turning their attention to Syria, with weapons and fighters trickling across the border from Iraq and Al Qaeda's leaders calling for jihad in Syria.
But there is reason for skepticism, too, as ''Al Qaeda'' has become a kind of phantom cited by almost anyone -- the Assad government to bolster claims that its opponents are terrorists, Washington as another reason to shun deeper entanglement.
The central issue is how to speed up what many now regard as the inevitable collapse of the Assad government without plunging the society into a civil war, said Volker Perthes, a German scholar of the region who runs the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.
''Arming the rebels and bringing about a civil war will prolong the regime,'' Mr. Perthes said. ''A real war is what Assad really wants, because it would allow him to overcome the reluctance of the great majority of the armed forces to fight.''
A real war would also be messy. Turkey, which shares a border with Syria, fears the growing instability and sectarian bloodshed. It worries about more refugees spilling over the border, having already accepted thousands. Israel, too, fears chaos. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed the idea that the Arab Spring will produce governments any kinder to Israel than the dictators who could at least enforce order.
As Syria slips deeper into turmoil, an alternative to Mr. Assad is not ready. The Syrian National Council is still trying to broaden its representation, establish its credibility inside the country and improve links with the independent Free Syrian Army. The Arab League and Western nations, like the United States and France, want to help, much as they helped to sell the Libyan Transitional National Council as an alternative government to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
Bassma Kodmani, a member of the executive board of the Syrian National Council, said that with the upsurge in deaths in Idlib and Homs, including those of at least two Western journalists and a Syrian blogger, the council's view was shifting toward encouraging foreign intervention, as painful as that might be. ''We are really close to seeing that military intervention may well be the only solution,'' she said. ''There are two evils, military intervention or protracted civil war.''
Indeed, the more blood that is spilled, the less likely that all parties will be able to coexist once the violence finally stops.
Ms. Kodmani said a ''Yemen'' model, whereby the Assads leave Syria and give up power to trusted elements in the current government, was already unacceptable, because military units under government control had killed civilians. ''The other crucial difference is that Yemen took six months and had 1,200 dead,'' she said, a toll already surpassed in Syria. ''We can't live with another six months at this pace of repression and killing.''
Even so, foreign military intervention seems unlikely. Russia, stung in Libya, has said it would veto any United Nations Security Council resolution mandating force.
On Friday, in Tunis, countries referring to themselves as the ''Friends of Syria'' -- minus Russia and China -- met with the Syrian National Council to discuss what the White House calls ''further steps'' and ''additional options'' against the Assad government, including calls for an immediate cease-fire, the provision of humanitarian aid and a United Nations peacekeeping force.
The Syrian government is in no mood to surrender. While there are signs of disintegration of central control, with only a minority in the armed forces willing to shoot unarmed citizens, for the most part, the military and security forces have not broken.
Sanctions are badly hurting the business class that supports the government. A senior Syrian security official recently moved his family out of the country, while a member of the large Assad family transferred funds abroad, a senior Obama administration official said.
But the longer Mr. Assad holds on to power, the more people will die. That is bound to make any political transition a bloody one, with a higher risk of revenge killings and attacks against those minorities, including Alawites and Christians, who have supported the government.
''The window for a peaceful transition is closing,'' the senior administration official said. ''It's now more a question of what happens after he falls. Can he fall fast enough that grievances won't fester?''

HEADLINE: The Greatness Of Ike

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
THIS year, two decisions will be made with long-term implications for how we think about the presidency. In November, voters will decide whether to give Barack Obama a second term in office. And sometime before then, the National Capital Planning Commission will decide whether to go forward with Frank Gehry's plan for a Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial.
The Gehry design is, well, Gehry-esque: it reimagines the traditional monumental form, using huge metal screens to depict the landscape of Eisenhower's Kansan childhood while devoting far less space to his accomplishments in World War II and the White House. (The only significant statue will portray Eisenhower as a barefoot boy, rather than a war leader or president.) 
The design has been widely criticized -- by the Eisenhower family, by architectural traditionalists and by right-of-center columnists like George Will and David Frum. Some of the critiques are purely aesthetic, but the most important ones are substantive: as planned, the critics argue, the memorial sells the supreme allied commander's greatness short.
What's interesting, though, is that by emphasizing Eisenhower's ordinariness rather than his heroism, Gehry is arguably being conventional rather than radical. As conceived, his memorial would ratify Eisenhower's current place in our national memory, not revise it.
Gehry's vision, as The Washington Post's Philip Kennicott writes, implies that while ''Eisenhower was a great man ... there were other Eisenhowers right behind him, other men who could have done what he did.'' Far from being a bold reimagining, this is a near-perfect summary of the way many Americans already regard their 34th president.
It's not that Americans don't like Eisenhower or think fondly of his service to their country. (Jean Edward Smith's new ''Eisenhower in War and Peace'' is the latest in a line of briskly selling Ike biographies.) But he is not nearly as beloved as many of his midcentury contemporaries. He's overshadowed as a war leader both by F.D.R. and by his many colorful subordinates, and his two-term presidency has attracted little of the posthumous enthusiasm that made his ''give 'em hell'' predecessor a folk hero and his martyred successor an icon.
In a 2011 Gallup poll on the greatest president, Eisenhower came in a lame 12th, in a tie with Jimmy Carter. He performs solidly in scholarly surveys, but he's frequently ranked behind his prominent 20th-century rivals.
In part, this underestimation is a result of the political persona Eisenhower cultivated -- an amiable, grandfatherly facade that concealed a ruthless master politician. In part, it reflects the fact that his presidency has always lacked an ideological cheering section. Liberals (who preferred Adlai Stevenson) generally remember the Eisenhower administration as a parenthesis between heroic Democratic epochs, while conservatives (who favored Robert Taft) recall a holding pattern before their Goldwater-to-Reagan ascent.
But ultimately Eisenhower is underrated because his White House leadership didn't fit the template of ''greatness'' that too many Americans pine for from their presidents. He was not a man for grand projects, bold crusades or world-historical gambles. There was no ''Ike revolution'' in American politics, no Eisen-mania among activists and intellectuals, no Eisenhower realignment.
Instead, his greatness was manifested in the crises he defused and the mistakes he did not make. He did not create unaffordable entitlement programs, embrace implausible economic theories, or hand on unsustainable deficits to his successors. He ended a stalemated conflict in Korea, kept America out of war in Southeast Asia, and avoided the kind of nuclear brinkmanship that his feckless successor stumbled into. He did not allow a series of Middle Eastern crises to draw American into an Iraq-style intervention. He did not risk his presidency with third-rate burglaries or sexual adventurism. He was decisive when necessary, but his successes -- prosperity, peace, steady progress on civil rights -- were just as often the fruit of strategic caution and masterly inaction.
Perhaps ''other men'' could have achieved this combination of steadiness, competence and successful crisis management, as the Eisenhower memorial's impersonal design seems to suggest. But few of them have occupied the Oval Office these last 50 years. Instead, from the 1960s down through the eras of George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- from ''pay any price, bear any burden'' to ''you never want a serious crisis to go to waste'' -- the defining vices of the modern presidency have been hubris, recklessness and overreach.
This is why the memorial controversy really matters. Eisenhower deserves a monument that puts him where he belongs -- in the very first rank of American leaders -- because the nation needs to be reminded of where true presidential greatness lies. Plenty of politicians combine inspiring rhetoric with grand ambitions. Far fewer have the gifts required to steer the ship of state away from every rock and reef, and bring it, eight long years later, undamaged into port.

 BODY:
Stella McCartney proposed that we take the tube. The concert was at the 02 arena in London's East End, and the traffic that December evening was sure to be heavy. She tried to make the prospect of cold stations and uncertain routes seem an adventure, but her husband, Alasdhair Willis, a tall, pleasant man with a slight Yorkshire accent, prevailed upon her (''Stell . . .'') to order a car. So at 6:45, joined by their son Miller, 6, and daughter Bailey, 5, who were being allowed to stay up late on a school night, along with a nanny, we set off in a black minivan to see her 69-year-old father perform a three-hour extravaganza of Beatles and Wings favorites with Jumbotron flashbacks of the Fab Four. Two more children, Beckett, 3, and a baby girl named Reiley, stayed home with a baby sitter in Notting Hill. 
As Miller and Bailey clowned and laughed on the jump seat, Stella called her father to report our progress. Miller, who had already announced, ''I want Granddad to sing 'Back in the U.S.S.R.'!'' then got on the phone, his freckled face beaming as he made his request. Stella gave an amused sigh. She was wearing a dark gray sweater -- a sample from a knitwear fitting held that afternoon -- with jeans and black high heels. Despite the number of sweaters and leggings she and her design team had pinned, pulled and ripped apart, the four-hour session ended on schedule at 4 p.m., and despite how numbingly tedious this work had been, she seemed refreshed by the thought of going to watch Bailey's ballet recital, which was scheduled for 5 at the nearby home of a friend. After that, of course, there was the concert.
In the arena's backstage, Stella and her husband greeted several tour hands. The corridor was crowded with friends and other special guests spilling out of a party room where drinks were being served. Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones wandered past, trailed by a young woman. Paul McCartney's new wife, Nancy Shevell, a slim, fine-boned woman who had been helping her husband get ready, came up, and Stella gave her a hug. We found Paul in his dressing room, a suite done in velvet-dark hues with a row of suits and shirts along one wall. He shook hands and then excused himself, saying he still had some warming up to do, and went into the next room, followed by Bailey and Miller. Soon there was the sound of gargling.
When the concert got going, Stella was on her feet, swaying and tossing her reddish blond hair and singing along. She has an excellent voice. She also inherited her father's chubby-cheeked countenance and his self-armored ease. By contrast, Mary McCartney, Stella's older sister and confidante, who came to the show with two of her sons and their young friends, seemed happy to remain seated most of the time. A photographer, Mary is darkly pretty and laid-back, but like her mother, Linda, she has no wish to master public life. Later, when I spoke to Laura Eastman Malcolm, Linda's younger sister, she described a trip in the family's station wagon: ''Paul was driving, and Mary turns to me and in this disapproving tone says: 'Do you like the fans? I'm sure you hate them!' She was 8. Paul loves the fans. He can deal with them.'' The implication is that Stella can also deal with public life. She says that, sure, the fans used to freak her out, too. ''You're like a little wall of defense,'' she told me a few days later. ''There's dad, and you're like this little wall in front, trying to spot who's going to attack.'' She laughed. ''And then you grow up, and you realize he's cool with it. He's done it since he was 17.''
Stella wanted to stay for the final encore, but Alasdhair, in a quiet voice, said that it was getting late and maybe we should leave, and Stella, without dropping her eyes from his face, said all right. The ride back to Notting Hill went quickly, with Stella now between Bailey and Miller on the jump seat. The children showed no sign of sleepiness, and Miller begged for a story.
Knowing that her son was fascinated by World War II history, Stella, who had been reading a book of letters written by the legendary Mitford sisters, began telling the story of Unity Mitford, the daughter of an aristocratic British family who insinuated herself into Hitler's inner circle and later shot herself in the head after Britain declared war on Germany. Suddenly, horribly, McCartney realized she couldn't possibly finish the story. She giggled with loopy fatigue. ''Oh, dear!'' Miller looked up, waiting for the denouement. ''And then,'' she said hurriedly, ''the English lady became very sad.''
The next morning, Stella would board a plane to Rome, where she was opening a new shop.
She may be one of the most interesting designers in the world today, but when she started out, the fashion world didn't have many nice things to say about Stella McCartney. A prominent designer in New York, at the mention of her name, used to shriek like a blue jay, ''The incredibly untalented Ms. McCartney!'' And there was the public put-down by Karl Lagerfeld when, in 1997, he learned that he was being succeeded at Chloe by a 25-year-old woman who was only two years out of fashion school. ''I think they should have taken a big name,'' he snipped. ''They did, but in music, not fashion.''
The man who hired McCartney for Chloe, Mounir Moufarrige, surely recognized the value of her famous family name. Moufarrige, an unctuous, hand-kissing executive, is the same individual who, a dozen years later, made Lindsay Lohan ''artistic adviser'' of Ungaro. McCartney was well aware of his game but also felt confident that she could run a Paris fashion house. After all, few major designers have come into the business better prepared than McCartney -- if being exposed, from birth, to the demands of touring, celebrity and the media counts as preparation. As for Moufarrige, she said with a wry smile, ''He was really my last connection to the McCartney thing.''
McCartney took with her to Chloe her best friend and classmate from Central Saint Martins, Phoebe Philo, with whom she had already started a talked-about label in her apartment in Notting Hill. ''I mean, we were living in each other's pockets,'' McCartney says. ''We were stuck like glue.'' The clothes that she and Philo designed for Chloe were exactly what you'd expect from two English girls out to make their mark in a Paris dominated by the brash talents of John Galliano at Dior, Alexander McQueen and, as of October 2000, Tom Ford at Yves Saint Laurent. McCartney and Philo's clothes were equally brash -- freely and crudely expressing the desires of young women for sex and fun -- with skintight pants, skimpy sequined dresses and airbrushed T-shirts (McCartney used T-shirts her parents bought in the '70s as a source).
McCartney and Philo, both single at the time, were presumably interested in those things themselves. Gwyneth Paltrow, who has been a close friend of McCartney's since they met in 1999, remembers being shocked at her wildness. ''I've actually never seen someone go from such a free spirit to such a kind of beautifully conventional, hard-working life as a wife and mother,'' she told me. ''She was in full fun mode when I met her, and I just fell in love with her. She was shockingly honest. I always say there's this kind of hidden ghetto side to Stella. She's tough. She doesn't back down from someone who might have less to lose than her.''
After McCartney left Chloe, some speculated that there was tension between her and Philo. But McCartney insists that ''we didn't have that fashion-chick falling out; we just moved on.'' According to Ralph Toledano, the respected executive who took over Chloe from Moufarrige and today runs the fashion division of Puig, McCartney pulled the design weight at Chloe -- not Philo, as many assumed. ''Phoebe had a lot of input,'' Toledano says, ''but Stella was running the show.'' One reason people concluded that McCartney was less talented was that Philo went on to triumph without her at Chloe // -- and later became the much celebrated minimalist designer of Celine -- while McCartney's first show for her own label was a flop. In what she now calls ''a massive misstep,'' McCartney sent out plastic guitar purses and clothes trashed with Cockney rhyming slang. The Allied bombing of Afghanistan had commenced the night before.
''I don't think you can blame that!'' she said, laughing at the memory. In a burst of British irreverence, she also hired Saint Martins students for her design team rather than professionals. ''But the biggest mistake was I was trying to be something that I wasn't.''
Where she has succeeded since then is in designing for exactly who she is. Now 40 years old, she has developed a witty, down-to-earth approach to dressing women like her: well-to-do, yes, but working women with lives of responsibility and complexity, women who have more use for a well-cut pantsuit for work or a roomy knit jumpsuit for hanging out with girlfriends than they do for a floor-length gown. McCartney is one of the very few designers, male or female, who make clothes for all hours of the day and not just the evening. In fact, red-carpet fashion has never been McCartney's strength. Kate Hudson, a friend, recalled wearing a dress by McCartney to the Oscars and laughing with her afterward, because ''I was on every worst-dressed list possible.'' Much more successful was a group of ultracurvy black cocktail dresses with a sheer, polka-dot panel down one side that McCartney designed in early 2011, after the birth of her last child, as if to announce she was ready to go out again. They were a huge hit with customers; in magazines, the dress looked as good on Jane Fonda as it did on Gisele.
It sounds incredibly simple, but after more than a decade of dead-serious conceptualism, postmodern irony and Galliano-type showmanship, the fashion industry feels stuck for ideas: designing from life for life -- rather than returning to the '60s, say, or drawing inspiration from the ''warrior woman'' or some other female fantasy -- feels fresh and modern.
The offices for McCartney's company are on Golborne Road, not far from the pots-and-old-boots charm of Portobello Road, and a 10-minute drive from her home. There are three levels, with the 13 members of the design staff, including merchandisers and designers for shoes and children's wear, on the top floor. Frederick Lukoff, the chief executive who previously worked at Apple and Lanvin, told me: ''This is a company of mothers. It's a unifying trait. These are organized, efficient moms. There are not many men, and the few are usually stunned by the level of organization of the women.''
In December, I attended several design meetings with McCartney and her team -- Carolina Brodasca, Natasha Cagalj, Sara Jowett, Frances Howie -- and I had the impression, most of the time, that they were finishing one another's sentences. The people around McCartney seem to have no trouble voicing their opinions about designs. ''I don't think she's competitive in that way,'' Jowett explained. ''She's like, 'Great, if you're doing something brilliant, then let's do that.' '' As Tom Ford, a close friend of McCartney's for the past 15 years, said: ''Stella is not competitive in the girl arena. She is a girlfriend.''
I later asked McCartney about the lack of hierarchy and attitude in her office. ''You know, the fashion industry has got some funny personalities,'' she said delicately. ''We don't. We like a nice atmosphere. We don't see the point in too much ego or competition. We just want to get on with it.''
When the Gucci Group (now PPR) agreed to back McCartney in 2001, the designer struck a very good deal for herself, the kind that was uncommon even then and almost certainly would not happen today. With the advice of her uncle, the lawyer John Eastman, McCartney negotiated equal ownership, 50-50. ''They were fighting for 51 percent, and I just kept holding out,'' she told me. ''The very healthful part of the relationship is that we're doing well, and they allow us to work in a fairly separate manner. Luckily, we're a strong-enough brand, and a different-enough brand, so they can see the value in the 50 percent they don't own.''
I asked McCartney if she ever considered asking her father for money to start her company so she could have full control. ''We don't do things like that in my family,'' she said. ''We work.'' Plus, by teaming with Gucci, she would also get its production and distribution know-how.
When I spoke to Francois-Henri Pinault, the chairman of PPR, he recalled only two occasions of mild tension: once after he bought Puma in 2007 and asked McCartney if she would consider doing a line for Puma rather than for Adidas, where she has had a popular women's performance line since 2004; and again when he transferred her much-liked chief executive to another PPR brand. She made her objections clear in both instances, Pinault said. (She prevailed on Adidas, but lost on the C.E.O.) He added: ''It's always the same with Stella. It's a tough discussion, but when it's over, it's over. She knows that she's the co-owner of the brand, its creative mind.''
Today the company has estimated annual sales of $120 million, a figure that doesn't reflect the brand's full retail power with licenses. And McCartney is expanding: in 2010, after a successful children's-wear line for Gap, she started Stella McCartney Kids. And at this summer's Olympics in London, British athletes will be wearing uniforms her company designed for Adidas, the team sponsor. This year, the company, which does most of its business in Europe and the United States, plans to open its first stores in China. McCartney has hinted in the past that she might not want to stay in fashion forever, but Lukoff dismisses the idea that she would ever sell. ''That's not the McCartney way,'' the C.E.O. said, adding: ''She's building an asset. She looks at the figures with keen interest.''
Those figures have not been much affected by the recession. Her clothing is as expensive as other designer labels -- a minidress from her summer line sells for about $2,200 -- but because she offers a full wardrobe rather than primarily evening wear, there is a larger price range than in a lot of her competitors' lines. (On the low end, for instance, is a T-shirt dress for $395.)
The sweater fitting on the day of the concert took place in a narrow, high-ceilinged studio at the rear of the building, with a view of a parking lot. Around 4 p.m., Brodasca told McCartney that she needed to look at some sunglasses designs before she left for her daughter's ballet recital.
''The folder is big, so I might have it sent to your house, and you can look through it this week,'' Brodasca said.
McCartney frowned. ''They always do this,'' she said to me. ''They give me folders. 'Take it home with you.' When I go home, I don't have time to do that.''
Brodasca continued, ''We're going to use them for the next two collections, so whatever you mark. . . .''
''I'll do it now, then,'' McCartney said.
She glanced at her BlackBerry. Each night, her longtime assistant, Samantha Merry, sends her an updated text of her appointments. That week, Beckett's preschool was holding its Christmas pageant and Miller was in a concert. McCartney's life is highly scheduled -- as a matter of salvation, her sister Mary suggested. ''I think Stella would crack up if she felt that she wasn't organized and was missing things with the kids; that would make her unhappy.'' She added, ''And it's not the way we grew up.''
After a quick look at the sunglasses, McCartney said it was time to leave for the recital, and I followed her out to her gray Mini Cooper. She tossed her black bag into the back next to two child's seats. Leaving the lot, she hung a left, hit the clutch and shifted, and in a moment we were sailing through the dark, winding, residential streets of Notting Hill. A few minutes later, we rumbled to a stop in front of a large house and went inside to watch six little girls dance in a room seemingly created for such a purpose.
Later I asked McCartney if her Mini was turbocharged.
She laughed. After a moment she said: ''My mum used to have a Mini Cooper. She had it custom-sprayed this metallic hot pink. She had a little microphone put in it, and she would sing to her eight-track. And she had a bench seat put in the front, and she'd always have four dogs in the back. My mum was renowned for collecting us late from school. I'd be on the village lane in Peasmarsh, and all of sudden -- yeeooww -- racing around the corner was this pink Mini with Neil Young screaming out.''
McCartney is in many ways her mother's daughter. Like Linda, who died in 1998, McCartney doesn't often wear makeup or fuss with her hair (though she doesn't go so far as to cut it herself, as her mother did) or worry much about her critics. That so many of her designs seem to say, ''This is me, whether you like it or not,'' suggests the depth of her mother's influence.
''She's a paradox, I've always thought,'' says Andrea Barron, a documentary-film producer, who has been a close friend of McCartney's for more than 20 years. ''She's as male as she is female. She's as feminine as she is strong. She's always present. She's one of those people, if you're talking, who listens. She's got balls, but she's gentle. Every paradox, and I've thought this since Day 1.'' For good or bad, contrast -- the stylistic refuge of many designers in the past 20 years -- is also at the heart of McCartney's fashion, with a masculine pajama print complemented by a swirly white trim taken from a ceramic pattern, a combination she used recently for minidresses. But she does the effect well, in a way that feels true to her.
The seesawing between one thing and the other relates, naturally, to her upbringing: the public/private nature of Paul and Linda's life, the to and fro between her ''more gritty Liverpool side,'' as she put it, and her cosmopolitan, well-to-do American side. In a work or social situation, you can almost see her drawing from both parts of herself, her conversational manner direct and mildly ironic. (One person, commenting on her ability to make people feel special, said, ''I can never work out when it's completely natural and when it isn't.'')
Perhaps the most obvious way her parents have influenced her is in her thinking about animal cruelty. She is the only high-end designer who makes exclusively nonleather handbags and shoes. Her Falabella bags, which feature a chain detail along the edge, are hugely popular -- according to Lukoff, accessory sales have grown fourfold in the last three years. Talking about her insistence on being leather-free, McCartney told me that she doesn't think the rules of the fashion industry change very much. ''They do on the design level, how a dress is made, but when it comes to how business is done, people pretty much follow the same rules,'' she said. ''Obviously I believe that using crocodile or leather to make a handbag is cruel. But it's also not modern, you're not pushing innovation.''
McCartney lobbies on behalf of PETA, as her parents did, appearing in a recent graphic video that exposes inhumane practices in the leather-goods industry. But she doesn't hype her ethics with hangtags. In part that's because she wants consumers to love a bag for its design, not as something eco, and in part it's because the system of fair-trade, sustainable, ecological products is not perfect. ''You can be making organic sweaters, fair trade, in Peru and the next month, that company is no longer in business,'' she said. ''Or it rained for a week, and the women couldn't get to work. So there are a million things that can shift the rules, which I think is interesting.''
Some of McCartney's best and most surprising designs seem to come from a world of happy homemakers. At the end of her spring 2011 show, following chic pantsuits and grown-up denim play outfits, she sent out shifts and blazers done in an oversize botanical print of lemons and oranges: a retro look with overtones of decorative aprons. (''A lot of people thought we had put a tablecloth on the runway,'' Cagalj says.) But McCartney was comfortable with the association. ''She's two women, in a sense,'' Barron told me. ''She's the woman who stands behind her man -- I'm sure you've seen that with Alasdhair. She cooks. She's that total '50s woman. But she's also the Madonna type, the woman who does everything herself.''
Her friends agree that marriage has changed McCartney. She and Willis met as she was setting up her company; he was then the publisher of Wallpaper magazine, which ran a creative agency on the side. He came to a meeting to discuss a logo design. Two years later, they married. ''One of the smartest things she has ever done is choose Alasdhair as her husband and the father of her kids,'' Paltrow told me. ''They complement each other. He's Northern, very practical -- not buttoned-up, but he's not like an American guy talking about his feelings all over the place. She's like a firecracker.''
Their wedding was in a castle in Scotland: three days of games, teas and horseback riding, and a singular gesture of love by the groom. ''We were having a cocktail on the lawn after the ceremony, and Alasdhair was making a toast, and he said, 'I'd like to announce a new addition to our family.' So we all thought she was pregnant,'' Paltrow, a bridesmaid, recounted. ''And then out from this row of trees comes this thoroughbred horse. Everyone burst into tears.'' Later, the bride and groom -- she having changed into a dress of her own design embroidered with stars -- hit the dance floor in a bit of Fred and Ginger choreography that had been rehearsed for weeks. ''It was insane,'' Paltrow said.
Even if marriage has calmed her, she still doesn't back down from a fight. The McCartney narrative has long included the story that, in 2001, when she left Chloe to start her own line, she turned down opportunities to design Givenchy and Gucci. According to McCartney, Tom Ford tried to persuade her -- over her protests that she didn't work with fur and leather -- to take the creative-director job at Gucci while he designed Yves Saint Laurent, which Gucci Group had recently acquired. ''He said: 'Just come to my studio and look at everything. Maybe you'll do it,' '' she recalled, shaking her head. ''As if all those exotic skins and corduroy hamster fur were going to turn me on and make me change my entire ethic.''
But when I spoke to Ford, he said: ''It was never a conversation about taking over at Gucci. I think she might have interpreted that at a certain point.'' He said he was aware of previous statements she made in the press, but ''I just never corrected her.''
''Oh, he's a lying, cheating . . . what?'' McCartney exclaimed, when I repeated his comment. ''That's the weirdest thing. Why would he take me into an office and show me every dead animal? Oops!'' She laughed and, frowning, said to me: ''How are you going to handle that? 'Stella says she got offered Gucci but she didn't . . . LOSER!' '' She continued to chuckle.
That Friday afternoon was a busy one for the design team on Golborne Road. In addition to garments for the fall runway show, set for March 5 in Paris, there was a preseason collection and a separate one that McCartney planned to show during London Fashion Week. Also, she and Brodasca had a Skype meeting with people from Adidas to discuss Olympic gymnastics uniforms. Starting at noon, at the table in the conference room, the design team began looking at line sheets and samples of fabric and yarn as they determined what they liked or still needed.
Looking at some jacquards and prints, McCartney said: ''This is all very exciting, but it really needs monitoring. Because in my head, I've got 500 different shows here.''
Jowett said, ''Well, the prints will hold it all together, and the technique will just add to the depth of what you -- ''
McCartney shook her head. ''I think we've just got to narrow it down.''
''We're low on time and manpower, let's put it that way,'' Brodasca said.
''And what about our fluid woman, she's not here,'' McCartney said, using shorthand for a soft garment. ''We have to help her.'' She turned to Howie. ''Almost a silk jersey. Is it not going to give you enough structure?''
When I left the office at 5, they were still working, empty teacups sitting amid the line sheets.
Almost every Friday night, McCartney and her husband leave London with their kids and dog and drive two hours to their country home, a former Georgian manor on about 400 acres, where they have a couple of horses, some ponies and a small flock of sheep, as well as extensive flower and vegetable gardens that Willis designed.
When I arrived at 9:30, McCartney, wearing jeans, an old brown sweater and heavy socks, was waiting in the doorway. She took my coat and said that she was making dinner. The children had already gone to bed. The house was utterly still. In the kitchen, Willis was throwing logs onto a fire in the walk-in fireplace, and McCartney was at the counter making pasta and a salad. A long trestle table stood in front of the fire. The walls were a pale blue, and the original stone floors were uneven and gleaming.
A large window above the sink overlooked the stable yard -- part of the property still to be renovated, as I saw the next morning -- and on the wall was a chart with each of the children's names, followed by rows of stars designating rewards and privileges. ''It's a way of keeping order,'' McCartney said. There was a corridor lined with boots and coats, and next to it was a breakfast room, where on one wall was an enormous photograph taken by Linda McCartney in the '70s of Paul and his children playing by a wooden fence at their farm in Scotland. ''We used to play on that fence for hours,'' McCartney said.
McCartney had warned that spending time with her would require weathering some conditions: vomit, tantrums, dog hair. But her children were well behaved and seemingly secure. The next day, when Reiley went down for a nap, Beckett was off with his father, and Miller and Bailey had returned to the weekend's central event -- the arrival of four wild kittens that were now living in the barn -- we sat on a big sofa in the living room and talked about Alexander McQueen, her good friend (they struck their deals with Gucci around the same time) who committed suicide in 2010. Before that, he was known to cut off contact for weeks at a time. She says she understands the desire to retreat.
''There are a lot of pressures,'' she said. ''It's overwhelming to leave the house sometimes. Even if I didn't have kids, I would be the same, but I think my brain is occupied with things other than fashion, fashion, fashion.''
Later, over a lunch McCartney prepared, I raised the idea with Willis that McCartney's brand might one day extend beyond fashion, not unlike the examples of Ralph Lauren or Calvin Klein.
Willis, who owns a brand-consulting firm that represents David Beckham, among others, said: ''I think Stella is associated with a value system -- sustainability, moral values -- that's absolutely relevant to the times. The other brands are just beginning to catch on to her values, but they don't have the authenticity. So the opportunity for her business to go into hotels and food -- ''
''Eggplant Parmesan?'' she interjected lightly.
Willis, serious, said to her, ''Ultimately, what you offer the market is derived from how you live your life.'' And then to me: ''It's not as if she's fabricated these beliefs for the sake of her business. People see that.''
But McCartney was not interested in discussing her brand or her business or her future when the afternoon was slipping away and it would be dark soon.
''Do you want to stay in the kitchen or go for a walk?'' she said, shifting her weight from one stockinged foot to the other. So we put on our coats and headed out into the field, taking Miller with us.

HEADLINE: True Innovation

BYLINE: By JON GERTNER. 
The author of the forthcoming ''The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation.''

 BODY:
''INNOVATION is what America has always been about,'' President Obama remarked in his recent State of the Union address. It's hard to disagree, isn't it? We live in a world dominated by innovative American companies like Apple, Microsoft, Google and Facebook. And even in the face of a recession, Silicon Valley's relentless entrepreneurs have continued to churn out start-up companies with outsize, world-changing ambitions.
But we idealize America's present culture of innovation too much. In fact, our trailblazing digital firms may not be the hothouse environments for creativity we might think. I find myself arriving at these doubts after spending five years looking at the innovative process at Bell Labs, the onetime research and development organization of the country's formerly monopolistic telephone company, AT&T.
Why study Bell Labs? It offers a number of lessons about how our country's technology companies -- and our country's longstanding innovative edge -- actually came about. Yet Bell Labs also presents a more encompassing and ambitious approach to innovation than what prevails today. Its staff worked on the incremental improvements necessary for a complex national communications network while simultaneously thinking far ahead, toward the most revolutionary inventions imaginable. 
Indeed, in the search for innovative models to address seemingly intractable problems like climate change, we would do well to consider Bell Labs' example -- an effort that rivals the Apollo program and the Manhattan Project in size, scope and expense. Its mission, and its great triumph, was to connect all of us, and all of our new machines, together.
In his recent letter to potential shareholders of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg noted that one of his firm's mottoes was ''move fast and break things.'' Bell Labs' might just as well have been ''move deliberately and build things.'' This sounds like the quaint pursuit of men who carried around slide rules and went to bed by 10 o'clock. But it was not.
Consider what Bell Labs achieved. For a long stretch of the 20th century, it was the most innovative scientific organization in the world. On any list of its inventions, the most notable is probably the transistor, invented in 1947, which is now the building block of all digital products and contemporary life. These tiny devices can accomplish a multitude of tasks. The most basic is the amplification of an electric signal. But with small bursts of electricity, transistors can be switched on and off, and effectively be made to represent a ''bit'' of information, which is digitally expressed as a 1 or 0. Billions of transistors now reside on the chips that power our phones and computers.
Bell Labs produced a startling array of other innovations, too. The silicon solar cell, the precursor of all solar-powered devices, was invented there. Two of its researchers were awarded the first patent for a laser, and colleagues built a host of early prototypes. (Every DVD player has a laser, about the size of a grain of rice, akin to the kind invented at Bell Labs.)
Bell Labs created and developed the first communications satellites; the theory and development of digital communications; and the first cellular telephone systems. What's known as the charge-coupled device, or CCD, was created there and now forms the basis for digital photography.
Bell Labs also built the first fiber optic cable systems and subsequently created inventions to enable gigabytes of data to zip around the globe. It was no slouch in programming, either. Its computer scientists developed Unix and C, which form the basis for today's most essential operating systems and computer languages.
And these are just a few of the practical technologies. Some Bell Labs researchers composed papers that significantly extended the boundaries of physics, chemistry, astronomy and mathematics. Other Bell Labs engineers focused on creating extraordinary new processes (rather than new products) for Ma Bell's industrial plants. In fact, ''quality control'' -- the statistical analysis now used around the world as a method to ensure high-quality manufactured products -- was first applied by Bell Labs mathematicians.
So how can we explain how one relatively small group of scientists and engineers, working at Bell Labs in New Jersey over a relatively short span of time, came out with such an astonishing cluster of new technologies and ideas? They invented the future, which is what we now happen to call the present. And it was not by chance or serendipity. They knew something. But what?
At Bell Labs, the man most responsible for the culture of creativity was Mervin Kelly. Probably Mr. Kelly's name does not ring a bell. Born in rural Missouri to a working-class family and then educated as a physicist at the University of Chicago, he went on to join the research corps at AT&T. Between 1925 and 1959, Mr. Kelly was employed at Bell Labs, rising from researcher to chairman of the board. In 1950, he traveled around Europe, delivering a presentation that explained to audiences how his laboratory worked.
His fundamental belief was that an ''institute of creative technology'' like his own needed a ''critical mass'' of talented people to foster a busy exchange of ideas. But innovation required much more than that. Mr. Kelly was convinced that physical proximity was everything; phone calls alone wouldn't do. Quite intentionally, Bell Labs housed thinkers and doers under one roof. Purposefully mixed together on the transistor project were physicists, metallurgists and electrical engineers; side by side were specialists in theory, experimentation and manufacturing. Like an able concert hall conductor, he sought a harmony, and sometimes a tension, between scientific disciplines; between researchers and developers; and between soloists and groups.
ONE element of his approach was architectural. He personally helped design a building in Murray Hill, N.J., opened in 1941, where everyone would interact with one another. Some of the hallways in the building were designed to be so long that to look down their length was to see the end disappear at a vanishing point. Traveling the hall's length without encountering a number of acquaintances, problems, diversions and ideas was almost impossible. A physicist on his way to lunch in the cafeteria was like a magnet rolling past iron filings.
Another element of the approach was aspirational. Bell Labs was sometimes caricatured as an ivory tower. But it is more aptly described as an ivory tower with a factory downstairs. It was clear to the researchers and engineers there that the ultimate aim of their organization was to transform new knowledge into new things.
Steven Chu, secretary of the Department of Energy, won a Nobel Prize in 1997 for his work at Bell Labs in the early 1980s. He once said that working in an environment of applied science like Bell Labs ''doesn't destroy a kernel of genius, it focuses the mind.'' At Bell Labs, even for researchers in pursuit of pure scientific understanding, it was obvious that their work could be used.
Still another method Mr. Kelly used to push ahead was organizational. He set up Bell Labs' satellite facilities in the phone company's manufacturing plants, so as to help transfer all these new ideas into things. But the exchange was supposed to go both ways, with the engineers learning from the plant workers, too. As manufacturing has increasingly moved out of the United States in the past half century, it has likewise taken with it a whole ecosystem of industrial knowledge. But in the past, this knowledge tended to push Bell Labs toward new innovations.
Mr. Kelly believed that freedom was crucial, especially in research. Some of his scientists had so much autonomy that he was mostly unaware of their progress until years after he authorized their work. When he set up the team of researchers to work on what became the transistor, for instance, more than two years passed before the invention occurred. Afterward, when he set up another team to handle the invention's mass manufacture, he dropped the assignment into the lap of an engineer and instructed him to come up with a plan. He told the engineer he was going to Europe in the meantime.
In sum, he trusted people to create. And he trusted them to help one another create. To him, having at Bell Labs a number of scientific exemplars -- ''the guy who wrote the book,'' as these standouts were often called, because they had in fact written the definitive book on a subject -- was necessary. But so was putting them into the everyday mix. In an era before cubicles, all employees at Bell Labs were instructed to work with their doors open.
Saddled with a difficult problem, a new hire there, an anxious nobody, was regularly directed by a supervisor toward the guy who wrote the book. Some young employees would quake when they were told to ask a question of famous mathematicians like Claude Shannon or legendary physicists like William Shockley. Still, Bell Labs' policy was not to turn them away.
THERE was another element necessary to Mervin Kelly's innovation strategy, an element as crucial, or more crucial even, than all the others. Mr. Kelly talked fast and walked fast; he ran up and down staircases. But he gave his researchers not only freedom but also time. Lots of time -- years to pursue what they felt was essential. One might see this as impossible in today's faster, more competitive world. Or one might contend it is irrelevant because Bell Labs (unlike today's technology companies) had the luxury of serving a parent organization that had a large and dependable income ensured by its monopoly status. Nobody had to meet benchmarks to help with quarterly earnings; nobody had to rush a product to market before the competition did.
But what should our pursuit of innovation actually accomplish? By one definition, innovation is an important new product or process, deployed on a large scale and having a significant impact on society and the economy, that can do a job (as Mr. Kelly once put it) ''better, or cheaper, or both.'' Regrettably, we now use the term to describe almost anything. It can describe a smartphone app or a social media tool; or it can describe the transistor or the blueprint for a cellphone system. The differences are immense. One type of innovation creates a handful of jobs and modest revenues; another, the type Mr. Kelly and his colleagues at Bell Labs repeatedly sought, creates millions of jobs and a long-lasting platform for society's wealth and well-being.
The conflation of these different kinds of innovations seems to be leading us toward a belief that small groups of profit-seeking entrepreneurs turning out innovative consumer products are as effective as our innovative forebears. History does not support this belief. The teams at Bell Labs that invented the laser, transistor and solar cell were not seeking profits. They were seeking understanding. Yet in the process they created not only new products but entirely new -- and lucrative -- industries.
There's no single best way to innovate. Silicon Valley's methods have benefited our country well over the course of several decades. And it would be absurd to return to an era of big monopolies. Today's telecom industries are thriving, and customers likewise have access to a dazzling range of affordable devices and services, which most likely would not have been true had the old phone company remained intact. Though it had custody of the world's most innovative labs, AT&T introduced new products and services slowly, and rarely cheaply. As Time magazine once put it, ''Few companies are more conservative; none are more creative.''
But to consider the legacy of Bell Labs is to see that we should not mistake small technological steps for huge technological leaps. It also shows us that to always ''move fast and break things,'' as Facebook is apparently doing, or to constantly pursue ''a gospel of speed'' (as Google has described its philosophy) is not the only way to get where we are going. Perhaps it is not even the best way. Revolutions happen fast but dawn slowly. To a large extent, we're still benefiting from risks that were taken, and research that was financed, more than a half century ago.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The cover photograph last Sunday with an opinion essay about Bell Labs and its contributions to scientific and technological innovation was published in error. The picture, from Magnum Photos, most likely showed workers at Allied Chemical in 1967 -- not at Bell Labs in New Jersey in 1966. The photograph had been incorrectly labeled in the studio of the photographer, Elliott Erwitt.
Also, a timeline with the essay incorrectly attributed a distinction to Bell Labs, based on information from the Web site of its corporate successor, Alcatel-Lucent. In 1933, Bell Labs gave the first demonstration of long-distance transmission of three-channel high-fidelity stereo sound -- not the first transmission of stereo sound. (Clement Ader demonstrated two-channel stereo sound transmission in Paris in 1881.)

HEADLINE: Regulating Our Sugar Habit

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The government regulates tobacco and alcohol. Why not diet? 

 BODY:
When Ronda Storms, a Republican state senator in Florida, is accused of nanny-state-ism for her efforts on behalf of a sane diet, it's worth noting. When she introduced a bill to prevent people in Florida from spending food stamps on unhealthy items like candy, chips and soda, she broke ranks: few of her party have taken on Big Food. And as someone who has called for the defunding of an educational Planned Parenthood program and banning library book displays supporting Gay and Lesbian Pride Month, she is hardly in her party's left wing. Not surprisingly, she's faced criticism from every corner: Democrats think she's attacking poor people, and Republicans see Michelle Obama. Soon after Storms proposed the bill, she told me, "Coca-Cola and Kraft were in my office" hating it.
Yet she makes sense. "It's just bad public policy to allow unfettered access to all kinds of food," she told me over the phone. "Why should we cut all of these programs and continue to pay for people to use food stamps to buy potato chips, Oreos and Mountain Dew? The goal is to feed good food to hungry people."
To some, dictating what recipients of benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program can eat seems unfair. But when the program began in 1939 it aimed both to feed the unemployed and to aid farm recovery. Participants received $1.50 in stamps for every cash dollar spent, 50 cents of which was designated for purchase of agricultural surplus. That's already a directive on spending, but perhaps more important is that nearly three-quarters of a century ago almost the only thing you could buy - with or without regulation - was real food. Since then Big Food has moved our diet in the wrong direction, and now we have a surplus of empty calories.
The argument for limiting the use of food stamps to actual food is consistent with established policy. They're already disallowed for tobacco, alcohol,vitamins, pet foods, household supplies and (with some exceptions) food meant to be eaten on premises. Payments have been based on the cost of a "nutritionally adequate diet."
Let me state the obvious: there is no nutritional need for foods with added sugar.
All of this is part of the bigger question: How do we regulate the consumption of dangerous foods? As a nation, we've accepted the need to limit the marketing and availability of tobacco and alcohol. The first is dangerous in any quantity, and the second becomes dangerous when overconsumed.
And added sweeteners, experts increasingly argue, have more in common with these substances than with fruit. In a recent paper in Nature, Robert H. Lustig, Laura A. Schmidt and Claire D. Brindis remind us that for the first time, chronic diseases pose a greater health threat than infectious ones, and of the three main risk factors for chronic diseases - alcohol, tobacco and diet - two are regulated and one is not.
The authors specifically target "any sweetener containing the molecule fructose (which makes sugar sweet) that is added to food in processing" as the key problem in our current diet, and correlate the rise in consumption of sugar with a rise in disease, listing the many ways in which sugar's effects on the body are similar to those of alcohol. Their contention is that sugar is hardly "an empty calorie," but rather an actively harmful one: "Fructose can trigger processes that lead to liver toxicity and a host of other chronic metabolic diseases."
Added sugar is not the only dangerous food. But unlike animal products, for example, which we also overconsume, it has no benefits. Yet we down it at the rate of 150 pounds per person per year, and while scientists argue whether it is addictive in humans (it meets the criteria for addiction in animals), it is most certainly habit-forming. Lustig and his co-authors suggest that actions like imposing taxes on added sugar or establishing a minimum age for purchase of sodas (they mention 17 in their paper) would reduce consumption.
The question "Is this necessary?" is unavoidable. But as obesity and its consequences ravage our health care system, we struggle not only with our own diets but also with preventing our children from falling into the same traps. Last year a brigade of parents stood watch outside a corner store in North Philadelphia in an attempt to prevent their kids from buying junk food.
They've been called foot soldiers, but you might call them vigilantes. Vigilantism occurs when people believe the government isn't doing its job. We need the government on our side. It must acknowledge the dangers caused by the most unhealthy aspects of our diet and figure out how to help us cope with them, because this is the biggest public health challenge facing the developed world.

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: Thurgood Marshall foresaw the dangers of Citizens United, but did anyone fully realize the consequences? 

 BODY:
If enacted, the tax proposals Mitt Romney outlined last week to the Detroit Economic Club would provide multimillion-dollar benefits to a newly powerful constituency: the rich men and women who are bankrolling "super PACs."
These policies - a 20 percent cut in marginal income tax rates; lowering the corporate tax to 25 percent; eliminating the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax; retaining the favorable 15 percent rate on capital gains - would warm the hearts and fatten the wallets of the six men who have given $1 million or more to Restore Our Future, Romney's super PAC.
The Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United, and a series of related cases, especially SpeechNow.org v. Federal Election Commission, which was decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, have not just gutted campaign-finance reform. They have undermined the democratic character of the presidential nomination process by empowering the rich to exert disproportionate control over it.
The nation's financial elite has acquired new leverage over politics just when the gap between the top 0.1 percent and the rest of the nation has already reached monumental proportions.
Two years ago, in Citizens United, the high court suggested that huge contributions would not corrupt candidates or create the appearance of corruption, because the money would go to technically independent expenditure committees. It would be difficult to find a campaign consultant for either party who would say that the court's view reflected political reality.
Already, by my count, 20 members of the Forbes 400, whose combined wealth is $135.8 billion, have given a total of $33 million - that's an average of $1.65 million each - to candidate-specific super PACs. And it's February.
Their contributions and those of their fellow mega-donors have already had a major impact. Without the $10 million donation by Sheldon and Miriam Adelson to the super PAC Winning Our Future, Newt Gingrich would have been forced out of the race long ago.
Romney was twice able to resurrect his campaign, in Iowa and Florida, because of the backing of a super PAC. Armed, as of Jan. 31, with nine contributions of $1 million or more from six men and three corporations and 14 more contributions of $500,000 to $750,000, Restore Our Future did the job.
As Mike McIntire and Michael Luo demonstrated in Sunday's Times, the putative independence of presidential super PACs from the candidates they support is a fiction. 
"It's just ridiculous," Fred Wertheimer, of Democracy 21, an organization that seeks to limit to the influence of money in politics, told me: 
The Supreme Court and the statutes are very clear that the independence has to be total and full between the super PAC and the candidate's campaign. The F.E.C. is interpreting the statute and Supreme Court decisions in ways that allow the candidate-specific super PAC and the candidate's campaign to be joined at the hip.
Only super PACs can collect and spend unlimited amounts from wealthy individuals, corporations and unions. "This gives the super PAC the capacity to raise and spend far more money than the standard PAC. It is what makes the super PAC super," Richard Briffault, a Columbia law professor, writes in a forthcoming article in the Minnesota Law Review: 
The rise of super PACs suggests that the real impact of Citizens United is likely to be the re-validation of the unlimited use of private wealth generally in elections, not just spending by corporations and unions.
That's exactly what's happened. The close ties between candidates and super PACs undermine post-Watergate reforms that were designed to limit the size of contributions to federal candidates. The sole restriction on a presidential super PAC today is that it cannot coordinate its activities with the candidate's campaign.
It is striking how quickly the courts have transformed the world of money and politics. Just 22 years ago, in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, which endorsed a Michigan ban on corporate contributions, Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for a 6-to-3 majority, affirmed the constitutionality of:
preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption in the political arena by reducing the threat that huge corporate treasuries, which are amassed with the aid of favorable state laws and have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas, will be used to influence unfairly election outcomes.
Citizens United explicitly rejected Marshall's warning regarding the dangers posed by the impact of concentrated wealth on the political process. The court declared that nominally "independent" committees can take unlimited individual and corporate contributions because they have an arm's-length relationship with the favored candidate that insulates that candidate from the potentially corrupting power of campaign cash.
Writing for the 5-to-4 majority, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy suggested that "independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption." Large donors "may have influence over or access to elected officials," but that "does not mean that those officials are corrupt."
The 2012 election is shaping up as a confrontation between two opposing camps, one calling for policies to ameliorate inequality at the expense of the affluent, the other for policies likely to increase it.
The Supreme Court has tilted the playing field in favor of those who have benefitted most from rising inequality, giving the richest Americans a new tool to control the political process at a moment when their economic power has reached heights unequaled since 1929.

HEADLINE: With Enrollment Plunging, a New Jersey Powerhouse Will Close

BYLINE: By NATE SCHWEBER

 BODY:
ELIZABETH, N.J. -- The oldest parochial school in New Jersey, St. Patrick High School in Elizabeth, which earned a reputation as a basketball powerhouse, will shutter at the end of the school year, the Archdiocese of Newark said.
Despite a shrinking student body, St. Patrick became well known in recent years for producing a disproportionate number of Division I college players, several of whom went on to play in the N.B.A., including Samuel Dalembert of the Houston Rockets, Al Harrington of the Denver Nuggets and Kyrie Irving of the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
''It's a great school that did a lot of great things for a lot of kids,'' said the longtime coach Kevin Boyle, who led the team to a 26-1 record last season before leaving for Montverde Academy in Florida.
He added, ''It's very unfortunate, but what are you going to do?''
Enrollment at the school, a stocky, red-brick building hunkered in the seat of Union County's troubled First Ward, plunged precipitously in recent years, said James Goodness, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Newark. In the last five years, it fell by more than 100, to 151 students. Only 20 freshmen were signed up for the fall of 2012, he added. To compensate, the archdiocese had given the school $100,000 subsidies each of the last four years.
''The school just was not able to meet basic costs,'' Goodness said Sunday.
Many school employees could see that dropping enrollment was creating economic woes for the school, Goodness said. But the news that the school would close, passed down via a letter two weeks ago from the archbishop, John J. Myers, and announced to faculty on Friday, still hurt.
''It's an awful feeling, like someone hit me in the stomach with a bag of bricks,'' said Rae Miller, 44, an assistant basketball coach at the school.
Former players said that the atmosphere at St. Patrick instilled in them the habits for success. Grant Billmeier, 27, who went on to be a two-time captain for Seton Hall's basketball team, credits his alma matter for his achievements.
''It's more than just a school, more than just a basketball team, it was like a family,'' said Billmeier, now the coordinator of basketball operations at Seton Hall.
The high school is on Court Street, amid blocks lined with dollar stores, liquor stores and bail bond shops, and in the shadow of the two aged, gray spires of St. Patrick Church. Outside, the rush of cars on the New Jersey Turnpike can be heard, along with the whoosh of jets from Newark Airport. The sign in front reads, ''St. Patrick High School, Est. 1868'' and features a cartoon of a short, bearded man in a green suit with his fists raised for fighting.
Donald Myers, 16, a freshman at Washington High School, a public school that faces St. Patrick across from Jackson Park, said he considered transferring to the Catholic school but learned that its declining enrollment had created a vicious cycle.
''I had friends who went to St. Patrick, but they transferred out because the student body was too small,'' he said. ''I thought about going over there last year and this year,'' but when he saw everybody leaving, ''I was like, Uh-uh, they don't have the resources.''
The closing of St. Patrick continues an unsettling trend in inner-city Catholic schools, particularly in North Jersey, where Paterson Catholic shuttered in 2010 and St. Mary in Jersey City shut down in 2011.
Adrian Wojnarowski, who wrote a book called ''The Miracle of St. Anthony'' -- about St. Patrick's Jersey City archrival, St. Anthony, which handed St. Patrick its only loss last season, in the state tournament -- called the news ''devastating.''
''You couldn't imagine high school games with more on the line; they weren't just fighting for parochial titles or New Jersey titles, they were fighting for national prominence,'' he said. ''There will never be anything like this again.''
St. Anthony Coach Bob Hurley, who first faced St. Patrick for the state title in 1973, said: ''Particularly in the last 15 years, it's become one of the best rivalries in the country. But when enrollment gets to a certain number, around 200, you're on a respirator.''
Mike Rice, the coach at Rutgers, said he always scouted St. Patrick players, knowing their scrappy surroundings and strong work ethic made for excellent athletes.
''Those kids from St. Patrick were kind of in the underdog role from not having bright, shiny facilities like everyone else,'' he said. ''They knew how to grind out a win. They were tough, hard-nosed individuals that just played hard and got better.''

HEADLINE: What Ails Europe?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Lisbon
Things are terrible here, as unemployment soars past 13 percent. Things are even worse in Greece, Ireland, and arguably in Spain, and Europe as a whole appears to be sliding back into recession.
Why has Europe become the sick man of the world economy? Everyone knows the answer. Unfortunately, most of what people know isn't true -- and false stories about European woes are warping our economic discourse.
Read an opinion piece about Europe -- or, all too often, a supposedly factual news report -- and you'll probably encounter one of two stories, which I think of as the Republican narrative and the German narrative. Neither story fits the facts. 
The Republican story -- it's one of the central themes of Mitt Romney's campaign -- is that Europe is in trouble because it has done too much to help the poor and unlucky, that we're watching the death throes of the welfare state. This story is, by the way, a perennial right-wing favorite: back in 1991, when Sweden was suffering from a banking crisis brought on by deregulation (sound familiar?), the Cato Institute published a triumphant report on how this proved the failure of the whole welfare state model.
Did I mention that Sweden, which still has a very generous welfare state, is currently a star performer, with economic growth faster than that of any other wealthy nation?
But let's do this systematically. Look at the 15 European nations currently using the euro (leaving Malta and Cyprus aside), and rank them by the percentage of G.D.P. they spent on social programs before the crisis. Do the troubled GIPSI nations (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy) stand out for having unusually large welfare states? No, they don't; only Italy was in the top five, and even so its welfare state was smaller than Germany's.
So excessively large welfare states didn't cause the troubles.
Next up, the German story, which is that it's all about fiscal irresponsibility. This story seems to fit Greece, but nobody else. Italy ran deficits in the years before the crisis, but they were only slightly larger than Germany's (Italy's large debt is a legacy from irresponsible policies many years ago). Portugal's deficits were significantly smaller, while Spain and Ireland actually ran surpluses.
Oh, and countries that aren't on the euro seem able to run large deficits and carry large debts without facing any crises. Britain and the United States can borrow long-term at interest rates of around 2 percent; Japan, which is far more deeply in debt than any country in Europe, Greece included, pays only 1 percent.
In other words, the Hellenization of our economic discourse, in which we're all just a year or two of deficits from becoming another Greece, is completely off base.
So what does ail Europe? The truth is that the story is mostly monetary. By introducing a single currency without the institutions needed to make that currency work, Europe effectively reinvented the defects of the gold standard -- defects that played a major role in causing and perpetuating the Great Depression.
More specifically, the creation of the euro fostered a false sense of security among private investors, unleashing huge, unsustainable flows of capital into nations all around Europe's periphery. As a consequence of these inflows, costs and prices rose, manufacturing became uncompetitive, and nations that had roughly balanced trade in 1999 began running large trade deficits instead. Then the music stopped.
If the peripheral nations still had their own currencies, they could and would use devaluation to quickly restore competitiveness. But they don't, which means that they are in for a long period of mass unemployment and slow, grinding deflation. Their debt crises are mainly a byproduct of this sad prospect, because depressed economies lead to budget deficits and deflation magnifies the burden of debt.
Now, understanding the nature of Europe's troubles offers only limited benefits to the Europeans themselves. The afflicted nations, in particular, have nothing but bad choices: either they suffer the pains of deflation or they take the drastic step of leaving the euro, which won't be politically feasible until or unless all else fails (a point Greece seems to be approaching). Germany could help by reversing its own austerity policies and accepting higher inflation, but it won't.
For the rest of us, however, getting Europe right makes a huge difference, because false stories about Europe are being used to push policies that would be cruel, destructive, or both. The next time you hear people invoking the European example to demand that we destroy our social safety net or slash spending in the face of a deeply depressed economy, here's what you need to know: they have no idea what they're talking about.

HEADLINE: Long Lines As Senegal Chooses A President

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

 BODY:
DAKAR, Senegal -- A volatile test for this small West African nation's established democracy unfolded on Sunday as voters decided whether the country's elderly president should be permitted to stay in power.
President Abdoulaye Wade, reported to be 85 but probably older, is seeking a third term in spite of a constitutional limit that allows for no more than two. His decision to press for continued power, sanctified by handpicked lawyers and judges, has created an uproar in a peaceful country used to looking askance at African neighbors where democratic rules are regularly flouted.
After weeks of sporadic protests downtown, rock-throwing at the police and tear-gas volleys in response, voters filled the sandy courtyards of dilapidated school buildings and other polling places on Sunday to choose among Mr. Wade, a French-trained lawyer whose political career has lasted five decades, and a field of 13 opponents, including 3 of his 6 former prime ministers. Mr. Wade himself was loudly booed as he went to vote Sunday at his home precinct in Dakar, the capital. 
At one polling place, at a school in the working-class Dakar neighborhood of Ouakam, the mood was largely against the president, who has been in power since 2000. Voters repeatedly expressed anger that Mr. Wade was showing disrespect for the law and Senegal's tradition of democracy in a country that has never seen a military coup d'etat.
Voters in long lines -- much longer than usual, some said -- snaked around the low, tan-colored school building to cast their ballots under the palm trees in the brilliant sunshine. Many were young, a group that is especially disenchanted with the elderly Mr. Wade and that has been hit hard by the unemployment crisis in Senegal, where the jobless rate is over 50 percent.
''The country is in danger. We've got a president who doesn't have the right to three terms,'' said Mamadou Gueye, 35, a tobacco company executive.
Mansour Diop, 41, a hospital administrator, said: ''We've got a president who wants a third term, which is totally against the Constitution. It's not allowed. He tried to force things, and now see what this has brought.''
Mr. Diop added, ''I don't even consider him a candidate.''
There will be a second round of voting in March if none of the candidates wins more than 50 percent. Results from the first round are expected this week.
Mr. Wade has built roads and highways during his years in power, but his government has also been accused of corruption, an issue that was raised repeatedly in the American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks. He is also accused of squandering scarce resources in an impoverished country that depends on foreign aid.
A 180-foot-high Soviet Social Realism-style statue to the ''African Renaissance'' -- which cost $27 million and which Mr. Wade erected to tower over the Ouakam neighborhood in Dakar -- has emerged as a symbol of the president's misplaced priorities. The poverty rate here is well over 50 percent.
''He likes power because he loves the privileges,'' a principal opponent, Macky Sall, one of Mr. Wade's former prime ministers, said in an interview. ''The cars, the planes, the money.''
Senegal's place on the United Nations Human Development Index has hardly changed under Mr. Wade's rule, and it still must import more than half its rice, the national staple, despite the loudly trumpeted but largely unrealized plans to transform the faltering agricultural sector, a major employer for the 12.5 million people.
Mr. Wade's determination to run for a third term has been openly criticized by the country's principal aid donors, France and the United States, with both countries suggesting in the weeks leading up to the election that he should reconsider.
''For us it is somewhat regrettable,'' a top State Department official, William Fitzgerald, told French radio in January.
The criticism from abroad has infuriated the prickly Mr. Wade, one of the last of the founding generation of African nationalists who led their countries out of European colonialism. ''I am not docile,'' Mr. Wade told the French newspaper Journal du Dimanche over the weekend. ''Like Senghor, I would reply, 'I am not a Negro house-boy,' '' he said, referring to the country's revered founding president, the poet Leopold Sedar Senghor, who died in 2001.
Meanwhile, there were fears that the unrest -- small-scale so far, with the well-trained police force largely showing restraint -- might spill over into something uglier if Mr. Wade was declared the winner.
''If Wade says he has won, I'm afraid it will be like the Ivory Coast,'' said Alassane Ndiaye, 34, a woodworker who voted on Sunday. He was referring to the recent civil war in that country that was set off when the president refused to give up power after losing an election. ''It will bring chaos.''

HEADLINE: Airlines, Emissions and Europe's Sensible Plan

 BODY:
The carbon dioxide from airplanes accounts for about 3 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, a share projected to go up as air traffic rises. The European Union is now requiring airlines that fly into or out of Europe to pay a fee for these emissions. This is a smart response to an urgent problem. The United States and the other nations opposing the program should either come up with a better idea -- soon -- or drop their objections. 
Under the scheme, essentially a cap-and-trade system, airlines will be given an emissions ceiling and allocated permits. They will have to buy new permits only if they exceed the ceiling. This will put a premium on operating more efficiently. And Europe's hope is that it will avert any increase in emissions and lead to a modest drop, beginning with a 3 percent cut this year compared with a 2004-6 baseline.
The United States, Russia, China and 20 other nations opposed to the plan met in Moscow last week to plot a response. Though no specific actions were agreed, there was much belligerent talk, and even a list of possible retaliatory actions, including levies on European-based airlines that fly internationally. Russia suggested that it might withdraw permissions for European airlines to fly over Siberia on routes from Europe to Asia.
For the sake of their own financial survival, many airlines are trying to become more efficient. But like the power industries, many of which have vociferously resisted cap and trade, they want to change on their own schedule, and without the threat of penalties.
Governments are clearly listening to their airlines. Many, notably Russia and China, also bristle at what they see as an insult to their sovereignty. The Obama administration says it would prefer a global agreement under United Nations auspices. That would be great. But Europe argues, with some justification, that talks aimed at such an agreement have been going on fruitlessly for 15 years, while the problem of climate change continues to grow.
It is not yet clear how many airlines, if any, will exceed their allotment, and by how much. Some of them have already added small surcharges -- $3 in the case of Delta Air Lines -- in anticipation of having to pay something when the E.U. presents the bill.
The cost estimates are all over the lot. The E.U. expects a first-year increase of $2.60 in the price of a ticket between Europe and China. The International Air Transport Association says increases could be in the $20 to $45 range. Either way, passengers are not looking at charges much greater than what it now costs to check a single bag. This seems a small price to pay for encouraging more efficient airlines and beginning to address global warming.

HEADLINE: Regulating Our Sugar Habit

BYLINE: By MARK BITTMAN

 BODY:
When Ronda Storms, a Republican state senator in Florida, is accused of nanny-state-ism for her efforts on behalf of a sane diet, it's worth noting. When she introduced a bill to prevent people in Florida from spending food stamps on unhealthy items like candy, chips and soda, she broke ranks: few of her party have taken on Big Food. And as someone who has called for the defunding of an educational Planned Parenthood program and banning library book displays supporting Gay and Lesbian Pride Month, she is hardly in her party's left wing. Not surprisingly, she's faced criticism from every corner: Democrats think she's attacking poor people, and Republicans seeMichelle Obama. Soon after Storms proposed the bill, she told me, ''Coca-Cola and Kraft were in my office'' hating it.
Yet she makes sense. ''It's just bad public policy to allow unfettered access to all kinds of food,'' she told me over the phone. ''Why should we cut all of these programs and continue to pay for people to use food stamps to buy potato chips, Oreos and Mountain Dew? The goal is to feed good food to hungry people.'' 
To some, dictating what recipients of benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program can eat seems unfair. But when the program began in 1939 it aimed both to feed the unemployed and to aid farm recovery. Participants received $1.50 in stamps for every cash dollar spent, 50 cents of which was designated for purchase of agricultural surplus. That's already a directive on spending, but perhaps more important is that nearly three-quarters of a century ago almost the only thing you could buy - with or without regulation - was real food. Since then Big Food has moved our diet in the wrong direction, and now we have a surplus of emptycalories.
The argument for limiting the use of food stamps to actual food is consistent with established policy. They're already disallowed for tobacco, alcohol,vitamins, pet foods, household supplies and (with some exceptions) food meant to be eaten on premises. Payments have been based on the cost of a ''nutritionally adequate diet.''
Let me state the obvious: there is no nutritional need for foods with added sugar.
All of this is part of the bigger question: How do we regulate the consumption of dangerous foods? As a nation, we've accepted the need to limit the marketing and availability of tobacco and alcohol. The first is dangerous in any quantity, and the second becomes dangerous when overconsumed.
And added sweeteners, experts increasingly argue, have more in common with these substances than with fruit. In a recent paper in Nature, Robert H. Lustig, Laura A. Schmidt and Claire D. Brindis remind us that for the first time, chronic diseases pose a greater health threat than infectious ones, and of the three main risk factors for chronic diseases - alcohol, tobacco and diet - two are regulated and one is not.
The authors specifically target ''any sweetener containing the molecule fructose (which makes sugar sweet) that is added to food in processing'' as the key problem in our current diet, and correlate the rise in consumption of sugar with a rise in disease, listing the many ways in which sugar's effects on the body are similar to those of alcohol. Their contention is that sugar is hardly ''an empty calorie,'' but rather an actively harmful one: ''Fructose can trigger processes that lead to liver toxicity and a host of other chronic metabolic diseases.''
Added sugar is not the only dangerous food. But unlike animal products, for example, which we also overconsume, it has no benefits. Yet we down it at the rate of 150 pounds per person per year, and while scientists argue whether it is addictive in humans (it meets the criteria for addiction in animals), it is most certainly habit-forming. Lustig and his co-authors suggest that actions like imposingtaxes on added sugar or establishing a minimum age for purchase of sodas (they mention 17 in their paper) would reduce consumption.
The question ''Is this necessary?'' is unavoidable. But as obesityand its consequences ravage our health care system, we struggle not only with our own diets but also with preventing our children from falling into the same traps. Last year a brigade of parents stood watch outside a corner store in North Philadelphia in an attempt to prevent their kids from buying junk food.
They've been called foot soldiers, but you might call them vigilantes. Vigilantism occurs when people believe the government isn't doing its job. We need the government on our side. It must acknowledge the dangers caused by the most unhealthy aspects of our diet and figure out how to help us cope with them, because this is the biggest public health challenge facing the developed world.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Across Arizona, Immigration Ire On Back Burner

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
CHANDLER, Ariz. -- The angry protests over Arizona's tough policies focused on illegal immigrants are mostly gone. The sponsor of the state's touchstone immigration bill has been recalled, while two sheriffs who championed the crackdown are enmeshed in legal difficulties. And there has been a notable decline in police activity aimed at illegal immigrants, easing a long period of anxiety among Mexican communities.
Two years after Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, signed legislation that required all immigrants to carry documentation or face arrest -- a law that set off protests here and stirred a national boycott of the state -- concern about illegal immigration is no longer the all-consuming issue it had been for so long.
The fading of the issue, at least for now, was most recently on display in the Republican presidential primary. At a debate here last week, it took an hour before the issue that has shaken Arizona for five years was raised. 
''There's no doubt that in Arizona, there is immigration fatigue,'' said Scott Smith, the mayor of Mesa and a Republican. ''People want to talk about things that impact them every day. And the reality is that in Arizona, illegal immigration does not affect you as much as not having a job.''
''It's still important,'' Mr. Smith said. ''It's just not as controversial here as it once was.''
The change has prompted worry among some of the leading advocates of tough immigration policies, even as they predict that the tide will change again -- perhaps when the employment situation improves here and the flow of illegal immigrants slipping across the border picks up, or when the Supreme Court rules on a challenge to the Arizona law, SB 1070, later this year.
''It is not a front-burner issue now, because it's been displaced largely by our dismal economy,'' said State Representative John Kavanagh, a Republican. ''It worries me, but I understand why it happens. And I just always remind people that the illegal immigration issue hasn't gone away. It's just been overshadowed and temporarily shifted to the back burner.''
Ms. Brewer -- who announced on Sunday that she was endorsing Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, in this state's primary on Tuesday -- said in an interview that she had been disappointed by the limited discussion of policy on immigration and Mexico in last week's Republican presidential debate and during the campaign.
''I would have liked to see a candidate come forward who understands the terrible disarray the state of Mexico is in. It's a fractured, inoperable state right now,'' Ms. Brewer said. ''Everybody says they all have different ideas, but they all are basically saying pretty much the same thing.''
The economic problems here -- joblessness, home foreclosures -- have contributed to this shift in attention, along with the fact that there have been no recent crimes or arrests involving illegal immigrants. But not incidentally, this has taken place as some of the best-known players in the fight against illegal immigration here have run into legal and political troubles.
The sponsor of the original bill, Russell Pearce, the former head of the State Senate, was recalled from office in November in a display of the backlash that has caused alarm among Republican leaders. Joseph M. Arpaio, the sheriff of Maricopa County who has become one of the leading advocates of tough immigration policy, has been accused by the Justice Department of anti-Latino bias and abuses of authority.
Sheriff Paul Babeu of Pinal County was forced to step down as a co-chairman of Mr. Romney's Arizona campaign last week amid accusations that he had threatened to deport a former lover -- who was from Mexico -- after he threatened to publicize their relationship. Mr. Babeu, who is now running for Congress, had appeared with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, in a particularly tough immigration ad that Mr. McCain had used in his 2010 Senate run.
''The media coverage hasn't been so great because Joe Arpaio is facing indictment, so he is laying pretty low,'' said Bruce Merrill, an Arizona pollster and political analyst. ''We have not had any arrests. When the media covers it, it causes the attention to go up. There's a feeling here that it's not as important as it once was.''
None of which is to say that immigration is not a major concern for most people in this border state, or that the passions could not arise again. ''Around the country, jobs and the economy are on people's minds,'' said Representative Ben Quayle, Republican of Arizona. ''You can talk about the economy and you can talk about how we are going to secure our borders.''
Mr. Merrill said his own polls had found that immigration continued to be listed as a top concern of voters here; the difference was that it had been joined by the economy and joblessness.
Chip Scutari, a political consultant, said attitudes among Arizona voters from both parties were more nuanced than was reflected in the actions of the Republican-controlled Legislature. ''Many of the voters who support 1070 also support an earned path to citizenship,'' he said of the immigration law. ''I think border issues are in the mix. But because there's been such a quagmire, it's lost some of its sex appeal.''
Whatever the case, the waning interest may be something of a gift to the Republican presidential candidates, sparing them from being drawn into a ''who can be tougher on illegal immigrants'' fight that might hurt their appeal to Latino voters.
''They all kind of danced with the same rhetoric, but none of them wanted to embrace it as a central issue,'' said Representative Raul M. Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat. ''I think there was a calculated issue to minimize talking about something where they could lose voters.''
Whatever the short-term benefit for Republicans, Democrats and some Latino leaders argue that the party has suffered long-lasting damage. The spate of legislation has helped Democrats register more Latino voters and increase turnout in local elections, similar to what happened in California after Republicans supported tough immigration measures, including Proposition 187, the 1994 initiative that would have cut off public services to illegal immigrants.
''There has been a tangible, palpable momentum shift in the state, which is essentially saying, 'Well that was a disaster, and what should we do about it?' '' said James E. Garcia of the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. ''But the damage that the Republican Party did to itself in this state is absolutely comparable to what the Republican Party in California did to itself.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about the decreased focus on Arizona's illegal immigration policies misstated the timing of a campaign advertisement that featured Senator John McCain of Arizona and Sheriff Paul Babeu, who recently stepped down as a co-chairman of Mitt Romney's Arizona campaign amid accusations that he threatened to deport a former lover. The advertisement was for Mr. McCain's 2010 Senate campaign, not for his 2008 presidential run.

Accounts
Arby's Restaurant Group, Atlanta, shifted its creative account to Crispin Porter & Bogusky, part of MDC Partners, from BBDO New York, part of the BBDO North America division of BBDO Worldwide, which is owned by the Omnicom Group. Spending was estimated at more than $110 million. Although the decision was made without a review, it came a month after Russ Klein joined Arby's as chief marketing officer; when he was global chief marketing officer at Burger King, he used Crispin Porter as his creative agency.
The change by Arby's came six days after a presentation at a conference by Bob Kraut, senior vice president for advertising and marketing communications at Arby's, during which he said the ads by BBDO New York, which carried the theme ''It's good mood food,'' helped contribute to gains in awareness for the Arby's brand as well as sales. In a statement, John Osborn, president and chief executive at BBDO New York, said: ''There's not much to say. The numbers speak for themselves. We're proud of our contributions to the Arby's business.'' 
U.S. Cellular, Chicago, named Mullen, Boston, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, as advertising agency of record for creative and digital assignments. Spending was estimated at $100 million. The creative account had been handled by Publicis & Hal Riney, San Francisco, part of the Publicis Groupe, and the digital account had been handled by another Publicis Groupe agency, Publicis Modem.
Weather Channel Companies, Atlanta, hired the New York office of Bartle Bogle Hegarty as creative agency of record. Spending has not been determined. Weather Channel Companies -- owned by a consortium that includes the NBCUniversal division of Comcast, Bain Capital and the Blackstone Group -- has not had a creative agency of record in recent years.
People
Steffan Postaer joined the San Francisco office of Gyro as executive creative director, succeeding Justin Curtis, who left, the agency said, to pursue new opportunities. Mr. Postaer will join Robert Ray, president of the office, in leading Gyro San Francisco. Mr. Postaer had most recently been chairman and chief creative officer at the Chicago office of Euro RSCG Worldwide, part of the Havas Worldwide unit of Havas.
Alain Groenendaal, president and chief executive of Wing, part of the Grey Group division of WPP, will also serve as president and chief executive of the Grey Latin America division of the Grey unit of the Grey Group. He succeeds Riccardo Ferraris, who led Grey Latin America and Grey Brazil and will now concentrate, the agency said, on Grey Brazil. Also, Andrew Speyer, vice president and head of strategy at Wing, which specializes in campaigns aimed at Spanish-speaking Americans, was promoted to managing director.
Rick Beispel joined CNBC, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., as senior vice president for strategic client development, leading a new strategic sales unit. He had been senior vice president for new business development at the Nickelodeon kids and family group, New York, part of the MTV Networks division of Viacom. CNBC is part of the NBCUniversal division of Comcast.
Gillian Gorman Round joined Conde Nast Publications, New York, part of Advance Publications, as senior vice president for brand development, a new post. She had been senior vice president for marketing at the Lancome USA division of the L'Oreal Group.
Miscellany
Advertising revenue for national cable networks that run commercials totaled $22.1 billion last year, up 7.8 percent from $20.5 billion in 2010, according to a report from the Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau, New York.
Revenue for out-of-home advertising rose 4 percent last year compared with 2010, according to a report from the Outdoor Advertising Association of America, Washington. The year ended with a 3 percent gain in the fourth quarter, compared with the same period of 2010. Growth categories included schools, camps and seminars; media and advertising; miscellaneous services and amusements; and financial.
Global marketers are becoming more optimistic, according to the February report of the Warc Global Marketing Index, as a recovery in the Americas paces gains in marketing spending around the world. The index for the Americas reached 62.9, compared with 56.5 in January, and the index for Europe also rose, albeit slightly, to 52 from 50.4.
Facebook, which last year became the No. 1 seller of online display advertising, according to eMarketer, New York, may be passed next year by Google, whose online display ad revenue is growing faster than expected. According to a report by eMarketer, Facebook's total will be $2.58 billion in 2012 and $3.29 billion in 2013, while Google's total will be $2.54 billion in 2012 and $3.68 billion in 2013. The gap may grow even larger in 2014, eMarketer predicted, with a total of $4.76 billion for Google and $3.75 billion for Facebook.
The Demand Institute was formed by the Conference Board and Nielsen Holdings to study how consumer demand is changing around the world. Mark Leiter, executive vice president at Nielsen, will be chairman of the institute and Jonathan Spector, president and chief executive at the Conference Board, will be vice chairman.
Advertising spending in Japan last year fell 2.3 percent compared with 2010, according to an annual report by Dentsu, Tokyo, which attributed the decline largely to the effects of the earthquake and tsunami on the Japanese economy. It was the fourth consecutive year of declines, following declines of 1.3 percent in 2010, 11.5 percent in 2009 and 4.7 percent in 2008.

HEADLINE: Risk and Riches in User Data: Opt-Out Provision Would Halt Some, but Not All, Web Tracking

BYLINE: By TANZINA VEGA

 BODY:
Last Thursday federal regulators, members of advertising trade groups and technology companies gathered in Washington to announce new initiatives to protect consumers' privacy online.
But, as it turns out, privacy is in the eye of the beholder.
The Obama administration has pushed hard for a privacy bill of rights that would give consumers more control over what personal data is collected online and what limits would be placed on that data.
The advertising and technology industries, which have been under pressure to do more to ensure privacy, said they would support a ''Do Not Track'' mechanism that would be clearly and uniformly adopted by browser vendors and would allow consumers to opt out of having some companies, but not all, keep data on their online activities.
While the agreement would limit certain types of data collection, consumers would hardly be invisible on the Web. 
'' 'Do Not Track' is a misnomer. It's not an accurate depiction of what's going on,'' said Stuart P. Ingis, the head of the Digital Advertising Alliance, a trade group representing the advertising industry, which regards consumer behavior as crucial to its business. ''This is stopping some data collection, but it's not stopping all data collection.''
Thursday's announcement was the administration's first digital initiative since the antipiracy legislation known as the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, was met with furious reaction from the technology industry last month, and eventually dropped.
The issue of digital privacy, especially how users' data is collected online and then employed to show those users ads tailored to them, has been hotly debated for years.
The announcements represent the attempt to satisfy consumer privacy concerns while not stifling the growth of online advertising, which is seen as the savior of media and publishing companies as well as the advertising industry. According to the Interactive Advertising Bureau, digital advertising revenues in the United States were $7.88 billion for the third quarter of 2011, a 22 percent increase over the same period in 2010.
The industry's compromise on a ''Do Not Track'' mechanism is one result of continuing negotiations among members of the Federal Trade Commission, which first called for such a mechanism in its initial privacy report; the Commerce Department; the White House; the Digital Advertising Alliance; and consumer privacy advocates.
Until now, methods for opting out of custom advertising varied depending on the privacy settings of a user's browser or whether a user clicked on the blue triangle icons in the corners of some digital ads. Under the new system, browser vendors will build an option into their browser settings that, when selected, will send a signal to companies collecting data that the user does not want to be tracked.
The agreement covers all the advertising alliance's members, including Google, Yahoo, AOL, Time Warner and NBCUniversal.
Privacy advocates complain that the mechanism does not go nearly far enough in part because it affects only certain marketers. Many publishers and search engines, like Google, Amazon or The New York Times, are considered ''first-party sites,'' which means that the consumer goes to these Web pages directly. First-party sites can still collect data on visitors and serve them ads based on what is collected.
''There's never been an expectation that all first-party data collection would be stopped,'' Mr. Ingis said.
But third-party sites, which are networks that collect and use data to serve advertising tailored to the user, like DoubleClick (which is owned by Google); Advertising.com, owned by AOL; and a multitude of smaller ad networks would be restricted in the data they can collect on users if they select a Do Not Track option. Such companies would be limited to using data for purposes like market research and analytics but could not create detailed profiles on users or show them ads based on online behavior.
Some consumer privacy advocates, while offering measured praise for the new privacy option, saw the move as an attempt to thwart a more restrictive stance on data collection. Jeffrey Chester, the head of the Center for Digital Democracy, which is pushing for more restrictions on data collection, called the move a win for the advertising lobby.
In a statement, Mr. Chester said: ''We cannot accept any 'deal' that doesn't really protect consumers, and merely allows the data-profiling status quo to remain. Instead of negotiations, C.D.D. would have preferred the White House to introduce new legislation that clearly protected consumers online.''
But advertisers have plenty to fear if consumers use Do Not Track in large numbers. ''If there's a high rate of opt-out, it's an issue,'' said George Pappachen, the chief privacy officer of the Kantar Group, the research and consultant unit of WPP. ''Our position is data should flow,'' Mr. Pappachen said, adding that data helps drive innovation and newer commercial models.
Mike Zaneis, the senior vice president for public policy and general counsel of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, said large-scale adoption of the opt-out mechanism would have a severe effect on digital advertising networks and third parties that work with publishers to sell behaviorally targeted ads.
''The reality is if you had 50-80 percent of consumers opting out it could have a really significant negative impact on the third-party ad model,'' Mr. Zaneis said. ''There is no eraser button for the Internet. But we can address consumers' concerns about having certain data about them collected, especially data for advertising and marketing.''
Google, which is one of the biggest players in online advertising, would also be affected because it is both a first- and third-party publisher. The company earns most of its nearly $40 billion in revenue through search-related advertising, which would not be affected by Do Not Track.
But its display advertising business, driven largely by its DoubleClick ad network, representing some $5 billion in revenue, is considered third party and could be affected. The company expects to have the Do Not Track option on its Chrome browser by the end of 2012.
For advertisers, a lot will depend on how consumers respond. A recent study from the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press seemed to contain mixed signals on the issue: 56 percent of the respondents thought the government should not become more involved with regulating how Internet companies handle privacy issues. Yet 59 percent said collection of user data for targeted advertising was an unjustified use of a person's private information.
And there are still unresolved technical issues regarding Do Not Track, including what defines tracking and how that would apply to first-party and third-party Web sites. Over the last few months the World Wide Web Consortium, an international group that sets voluntary technical standards for the Web, has been working with representatives from companies like Microsoft, Google and Nielsen, along with academics, privacy advocates, legislators and digital advertising groups, to define the technical standard of Do Not Track.
The consortium is also considering whether sites like Facebook, whose ''like'' button is used across multiple Web sites, would be considered first-party or third-party sites.
''I do think you will see a lot of contention going forward about what Do Not Track means,'' said Thomas Roessler, the technology and society domain leader at the consortium.
Whether any companies should be allowed to collect data and follow users online, regardless of who they are, remains ''the million-dollar question,'' said Alex Fowler, the global privacy leader at Mozilla, the nonprofit organization that created the Firefox browser. Firefox was one of the first to include a Do Not Track option.
''When you look at user testing, the expectation for the user for Do Not Track means, don't behaviorally target me and also don't collect information on me,'' Mr. Fowler said.

HEADLINE: Loud Oscar Roar for 'The Artist': 5 Wins

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY and BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Flattery will get you everywhere.
''The Artist,'' a love letter to Hollywood, got hugs, kisses and the best-picture Oscar on Sunday at the 84th Academy Awards ceremony here. The film also took the awards for best actor and best director, in a minisweep that found the movie industry paying tribute to not just the movie but to its own roots as well.
''I want to thank Billy Wilder, I want to thank Billy Wilder and I want to thank Billy Wilder,'' said Michel Hazanavicius, the film's director, in keeping with a self-referential theme that ruled the evening.
Thomas Langmann, the producer, accepting his award for a mostly silent, black-and-white fable about an actor's struggle with the end of silent film, said the achievement was dedicated to his father, the deceased French director Claude Berri. 
Until Sunday no silent film had won the top Oscar since ''Wings,'' at the first Academy Awards ceremony in 1929. But nostalgia ruled the night, as ''Hugo,'' about another silent star, Georges Melies, won a string of less prominent awards, and ''Midnight in Paris,'' a comic time trip to Paris in the 1920s, took the prize for original screenplay for Woody Allen.
Meryl Streep, a winner for her portrayal of a doddering Margaret Thatcher in ''The Iron Lady,'' made her victory look like a shock. But she hadn't won since 1983, even though she reigns as the actor with the most nominations in the history of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, with 17 in all. Ms. Streep said she could imagine half of America gasping: ''Oh no! Oh, come on! Why her? Again?'' as her name was read.
When the only surprise is a victory by Ms. Streep, you know things are going by the script. Viola Davis, for her work in ''The Help,'' had been considered a strong candidate as the best-actress winner.
''Merci, beaucoup, I love you!'' shouted Jean Dujardin, as he picked up his award as best actor for a movie that was conceived in France, but showered its adoration on the Hollywood of yore.
After a dry spell in the early evening, ''The Artist'' gained momentum as the major awards were presented, beginning with a prize for Mr. Hazanavicius. The winner unscrolled a long string of French-accented ''thank yous'' that included Uggie the dog.
Christopher Plummer, born in 1929, won his first Academy Award, as best supporting actor, for ''Beginners.'' ''You're only two years older than me, darling -- where have you been all my life?'' said Mr. Plummer, in picking up a statuette that was first given for films made in 1927 and 1928.
It was long overdue recognition for Mr. Plummer, who had appeared in dozens of films over more than 50 years, and finally won for his portrayal, in ''Beginners,'' of a father who in his final years acknowledges being gay.
''Congratulations to Mr. Plummer; the average age of the winners has now jumped to 67,'' joked Mr. Crystal.
That was before Woody Allen, 76, won a best original screenplay Oscar for ''Midnight in Paris,'' bumping the average age still higher. That film was another nostalgia trip, about literary Paris in the 1920s. In keeping with a personal tradition, Mr. Allen was a no-show, and left the Academy to accept its own prize on his behalf.
Closer to present time, Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash had just won an adapted-screenplay Oscar for ''The Descendants.'' It was welcome recognition for a movie that once appeared among the front-runners for best picture, but seemed to falter as a grueling, monthslong campaign season showered pre-Oscar prizes on ''The Artist.''
There was a dollop of drama to the proceedings.
As the show passed its midpoint, ''Hugo'' had made the only show of force. A 3-D tale, set in Paris, it had won five Oscars, for cinematography, art direction, sound editing, sound mixing and visual effects.
Meanwhile, two hours in, ''The Artist,'' supposedly the night's front-runner, had won only two awards, those for its Jazz Age costume design and musical score. If the early snubs sent a shiver through Harvey Weinstein, whose company distributed ''The Artist'' in the United States, he could take comfort, at least, in a win for ''Undefeated.''
That film, about a black urban high school football team and its white coach, was also distributed by the Weinstein Company, and took the Oscar for best documentary feature. One of the film's makers drew a gasp in the auditorium when he broke Oscar protocol by tossing off a strictly forbidden obscenity -- something rare at the tightly controlled Academy Awards.
Chris Rock followed with a racial joke, about black men getting lousy roles even in animated films. It may have been in questionable taste, but it jarred the show closer to modern times.
''Rango'' was the animation winner, from the director Gore Verbinski and Paramount Pictures. Both DreamWorks Animation, which had ''Kung Fu Panda 2'' in the running, and Walt Disney's Pixar Animation, which had no nominee in the category at all, had watched their grip on the prize slip to Mr. Verbinski, who had never before made an animated film.
Elizabeth Taylor was the capper in an especially crowded memorial sequence that paid tribute to one after another among the film figures who died in the last year. The actor Ben Gazzara, the movie executive John Calley, and the Oscar show producers Gil Cates and Laura Ziskin were among them.
Finally, the show settled into its inevitable rhythm of presentation, thanks, and congratulatory applause -- in a typical Oscar broadcast, only a relatively small sliver goes to production numbers and pranks by the host. But the montage moments kept coming.
As the end neared, actors like Julia Roberts and Robert Downey Jr. were on film carrying on about why they love film. ''I've never had any of those feelings,'' said Mr. Crystal.
And the demographic jokes never stopped. ''Perky gets old fast with this crowd,'' Ben Stiller warned Emma Stone, as she milked a bit that wound around her status as a first-time presenter.
Indeed it was a mirth-by-any-means-necessary kind of night: Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Chris Rock, Kristen Wiig, Kermit the Frog and a parade of other comedians were among the presenters.
Mr. Crystal, his vaudeville grin firmly in place, set the tone early, opening the show with a song-and-dance montage that managed to send up the nine best-picture nominees, Tom Cruise, the movie ''Bridesmaids,'' and his own aging career all at once.
''This is my ninth time, my ninth time hosting the Oscars,'' he quipped in an opening monologue that seemed bent on leaving no one out. ''Just call me 'War Horse.' '' Pointing one of his barbs directly at the film industry, he added, ''Nothing can take the sting out of the world's economic problems like watching millionaires present each other with gold statues.''
The theater was gilded and draped in red, as were many of the starlets. The idea was to mimic a glamour that came with the movies of old -- a time when, perhaps, they mattered a little more than they do in an age of multiplatform entertainment.
The big show-business smile that infused the ceremony was more than a ratings ploy. It was also an effort by the Academy to move past a tumultuous Oscar season that left the organization bruised if not bloodied.
Mr. Crystal came aboard as host at the last minute in November, pinch-hitting for Eddie Murphy, who dropped out when Brett Ratner, his friend and a producer of the show, resigned amid a media storm over his use of an anti-gay slur at a panel discussion in Hollywood. Simultaneously, the normally staid Academy had to deal with infighting over its new chief executive, Dawn Hudson, and the changes she was trying to implement. Ms. Hudson finally defended herself a few days ago in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.
A generally weak box-office performance among the year's nine best-picture contenders -- only one of which, ''The Help,'' amassed more than $100 million in domestic ticket sales -- had already caused worry about the Oscar show's ratings potential. Then moviedom took an added blow to its confidence, watching this year's Grammy Awards show attract about 40 million viewers as music fans rallied around the death of Whitney Houston; last year's Oscars drew 37.9 million viewers.
Meanwhile, a demographic survey by The Los Angeles Times renewed questions about the 5,800-member Academy's cultural relevance. Membership was found to be overwhelmingly white, male and 60ish. The results echoed conventional wisdom, but provoked new debate about whether the Oscars still mattered to an increasingly diverse America, let alone a global audience.
The television ratings may provide a clue. (At 3 hours 8 minutes, the show ranked among the shorter broadcasts in recent history.) In the meantime, the longing for past glory was perhaps most wistfully expressed by Bret McKenzie, whose composition, ''Man or Muppet,'' won for best original song.
Backstage, Mr. McKenzie modestly allowed that his song, for the film ''The Muppets,'' couldn't hold a candle to Paul Williams and Kenneth Ascher's ''Rainbow Connection,'' which has been Kermit the Frog's theme song through the years.
That song was a classic, Mr. McKenzie said; his own, he contended, was nothing by comparison. Somewhere in that was a lesson for the night.

HEADLINE: In the Romney Campaign, Precision Has Its Pitfalls

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER; Michael Barbaro contributed reporting from Shelby, Mich.

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's campaign typically leaves little to chance, so when his aides discovered three drunken homeless men on a bench, smoking and shouting, outside Nashua City Hall in New Hampshire, where Mr. Romney was set to receive a major endorsement, they swung into action.
Will Ritter, the 28-year-old director of candidate operations and advance, went to a diner and bought the men hot sandwiches and coffee. He then sat down with them, chatted about their life stories and eventually struck a deal. The men, he said, were welcome to stay and be a part of the event as long as they did not disrupt it with heckling. The men agreed, and the endorsement in November went off without a hitch. 
That kind of tight management and obsession with detail, right down to the size of the American flags hung at Romney events, is precisely the image the campaign wants to convey as it seeks to present Mr. Romney as an exacting and disciplined chief executive whose candidacy is infused with inevitability. But the blunder in Detroit on Friday, when Mr. Romney agreed to deliver an economic address to 1,200 people in a 65,000-seat stadium -- a display of bad political visuals that all but swamped his message four days before the Michigan primary -- showed how even his organization can slip up under the grueling strain of a long campaign.
And while Mr. Romney is now counting more than ever on superior organization and planning to pull him through what is shaping up to be a protracted state-by-state battle for delegates, he continues to fight the perception among some voters that he, like the operation working to elect him, is a triumph of political engineering over passion and authenticity.
Every presidential campaign crystallizes its candidate's personality, proclivities and preoccupations, including, four years ago, President Obama's ''no drama'' ethos and Senator John McCain's freewheeling ''maverick'' bid, which led to his selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate.
''Every organization is a reflection of the principal, and I think there's an attention paid to detail, ample planning is done, and this is not a campaign that says, 'Well, let's just wing it and see what happens,' '' said Kevin Madden, a Romney adviser. ''If you look at campaigns, how they're managed and organized is often a reflection of what you expect your presidency to be like.''
But a candidate who promotes an image as a skilled manager can suffer more when things go awry. And the no-folding-chair-out-of-place meticulousness has at times contributed to the perception of Mr. Romney as a distant figure. In the run-up to his trouncing by Rick Santorum in Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri, Mr. Romney, seeking to minimize potentially troublesome unscripted moments, had begun eschewing long town-hall-style question-and-answer sessions with voters -- a hallmark of his New Hampshire strategy, with their spontaneous and personal exchanges -- in favor of large rallies and events with narrow messages.
The Romney campaign has always been a tightly controlled shop. Even as it was imploding amid internal feuding and turf battles in 2008, Mr. Romney stanched most leaks and concealed the full magnitude of the breakdown until after he had withdrawn from the race.
Four years later, his campaign has returned leaner and sleeker, and with an even more disciplined aura. It relentlessly monitors Twitter, pushing back on individual messages. It tries to control the images that photographers can produce, sometimes limiting their position to encourage wide shots showing Mr. Romney surrounded by a huge crowd. And its young staff members -- often blamed, incorrectly, for any and all leaks -- are all but forbidden to even chat with the press.
Other campaigns have struggled to simply organize events. Mr. Santorum recently held a rally in almost complete darkness, giving his face a ghoulish hue. And a lapse in communications between Newt Gingrich's national and local staffs caused him to cancel a meeting with Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada, a popular Republican who was reportedly embarrassed by the episode.
''You can't beat President Obama with an unorganized, under-resourced candidate,'' Eric Fehrnstrom, a top adviser to Mr. Romney, said before the stadium event in Detroit. ''A few of our opponents can't make the ballot in some states or put together full slates of delegates. They even have trouble organizing a press charter. Mitt Romney is not only the best person to go against Obama on jobs and the economy, he also happens to be the candidate with the most effective campaign operation.''
When Mr. Romney's crowds began growing rapidly in Iowa, the campaign's young advance staff mobilized, calling friends from previous campaigns to come out and volunteer and scrambling to secure larger venues and extra rooms.
But it is impossible to engineer chance out of everything in presidential politics, and even before Friday, Mr. Romney and his aides had had their hiccups.
After a poor debate performance last month, Mr. Romney's advance team failed to generate much of crowd for a rally in Florence, S.C. The result: a scaled-down version of what would happen in Detroit, with Mr. Romney pictured in the next day's newspapers in an oversize ballroom, addressing a crowd more typical of a city comptroller's race.
A few days later, his team planned an appearance at Tommy's Country Ham House in Greenville, S.C., only to find out that Mr. Gingrich, then his biggest rival, was holding an event there at the same time. (The restaurant told reporters that while someone there had spoken to Mr. Gingrich's camp, Mr. Romney's staff had not called to set something up.)
Mr. Romney averted a Ham House showdown by showing up an hour early, thereby fueling reports that despite his aides' protestations, he was running scared from Mr. Gingrich.
On Tuesday morning in Shelby, Mich., several members of Mr. Romney's advance staff agonized and obsessed over how to straighten out a banner that said, ''Cut the spending.'' Though the banner seemed perfectly level, they kept finding flaws.
Soon, a group of five had gathered, lifting the left side, then lowering it just so. An all-clear sign was given, then rescinded.
''Are we still worried about this?'' one asked after repeated attempts to get everything exactly right.
''Yes,'' came the reply. ''It's still off by a hair.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Deficit Dilemma

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama was backstage at an auditorium at George Washington University last April preparing to give a major speech, when William M. Daley, then his chief of staff, spied an unexpected guest in the audience: Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, whose budget plan Mr. Obama was about to shred.
''Try to tell the president!'' Mr. Daley directed an aide.
It was too late to deliver a warning. Mr. Obama went on stage and outlined his proposal to reduce deficits -- but not before he flayed the Ryan plan, saying its deep tax cuts and deeper spending reductions would harm students, seniors, the disabled and the nation. 
''It's not going to happen as long as I'm president,'' Mr. Obama vowed.
Ten months later, the attack that left Mr. Ryan fuming in the front row is better remembered than the ideas Mr. Obama presented that day, administration supporters lament.
It came just a few months after the president had opted not to endorse the recommendations of a deficit commission he had created in hopes of brokering a bold, bipartisan deficit deal. That gave rise to a portrayal that has stuck, popularized by Republicans, pundits and some Democrats: that the president, out of political timidity, snubbed his own panel's plan.
Mitt Romney, a Republican presidential candidate, recently charged that Mr. Obama ''simply brushed aside'' the plan by the so-called Bowles-Simpson commission (named after its two chairmen) -- even though he and most Republicans reject it for its proposed tax increases. Warren E. Buffett, an Obama ally, has said ignoring the plan was ''a travesty.'' Former Representative John M. Spratt Jr., a Democrat on the commission, said the administration had had an opportunity ''to stand up and be counted, and for the most part they weren't there.''
Yet starting with that April speech, Mr. Obama has come to adopt most of the major tenets supported by a majority of the commission's members, though his proposals do not go as far. He has called for cutting deficits more than $4 trillion over 10 years by shaving all spending, including for the military, Medicare and Social Security; overhauling the tax code to raise revenues and lower rates; and writing rules to lock in savings.
But he did so months after the commission's report in December 2010, and largely without acknowledging that he was borrowing from its recommendations. That caution reflected White House concerns about liberals' hostility to the plan and, aides say, Mr. Obama's certainty that Republicans would reject anything he endorsed.
The story of how Mr. Obama dealt with Bowles-Simpson illuminates his struggles with the deficit politics that have curbed his ambitions and forced him to confront the limits of his persuasive powers. Faced with an even more intransigent opposition after Republicans captured the House in the 2010 elections, Mr. Obama made a tactical retreat, suppressing his instincts to ''go big'' in favor of a go-slow approach.
He settled into trench warfare, waiting for House Republicans to make their fiscal moves and betting they would get so much criticism that ultimately they would compromise -- much like what happened between President Bill Clinton and Republicans in the 1990s. Last summer, Mr. Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner nearly clinched a ''grand bargain'' reducing deficits up to $3 trillion over 10 years, but the deal fell apart over taxing the wealthy -- an issue that continues to divide the parties.
Today, Mr. Obama and Republicans are battling rather than making deals, positioning themselves for an election that will determine which side has the upper hand in December, when critical budget deadlines could force a compromise in a lame-duck Congress.
Despite the impasse, Mr. Obama appears to have reaped some advantages. Polls show that voters overwhelmingly agree with him that higher taxes on the wealthy must be part of a solution. And by smaller margins, voters favor him over Congressional Republicans when asked who can better reduce deficits while protecting needed programs. That plays to his re-election strategy: while the midterms amounted to a referendum on his record, Mr. Obama is framing 2012 as a choice between two distinct approaches.
But the downsides for Mr. Obama have become clear. His partisan turn undercuts a central promise of his 2008 campaign, to rise above the rancor. And by neither embracing Bowles-Simpson nor explaining his objections and quickly offering an alternative, Mr. Obama arguably failed to show leadership on perhaps the country's biggest problem. This month, in a New York Times/CBS News poll, 59 percent of Americans disapproved of his handling of the deficit.
Looking back, administration officials insist that Mr. Obama was right not to adopt the commission plan. ''You couldn't get a C-plus on a political strategy paper that argues that would be the way to get something done,'' said Gene Sperling, an economic adviser.
Three weeks ago Mr. Obama met with Erskine B. Bowles, a former chief of staff to Mr. Clinton who was a co-chairman of the commission along with former Senator Alan K. Simpson, a Republican. In speeches nationwide, the chairmen have expressed disappointment that the president -- and Republicans -- did not take up their plan.
On a quiet Friday in a room off the Oval Office, Mr. Bowles and Mr. Obama chewed over cheeseburgers and their differences.
''The president wanted to make sure that we understood that he had had a strategy to take the framework of what we'd negotiated'' on the commission, Mr. Bowles said, ''and to use that as a vehicle to negotiate a deal.''
Mr. Obama said that if he had ''put his arms around'' the plan immediately, Mr. Bowles recalled, it ''would have been savaged by Republicans, and that would have killed it.''
A Commission Is Born
From the start, some Obama advisers were wary of a commission. But while the administration was consumed in its first year with initiatives that critics would denounce as big-government liberalism -- the stimulus package to help revive the economy and the health care law -- the president had mused to aides about a bipartisan panel to address the mounting debt. He had inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit for 2009, roughly the size of the 2012 shortfall, and benefits for an aging population soon would increase deficits to unsustainable levels.
In the summer of 2009, he charged economic advisers with researching the history of presidential commissions. Their findings were discouraging: in decades of such panels, only one, the 1983 Greenspan commission to save a bankrupt Social Security system, had produced results.
By 2010, signs of economic recovery alternated with reports of continued high unemployment and home foreclosures. Inside the White House, an intensifying debate over a commission reflected the tension between those seeking continued stimulus, including Lawrence H. Summers, then the senior economic adviser, and those emphasizing deficit reduction, chiefly the former budget director, Peter R. Orszag.
Mr. Orszag argued that forming a panel could buy the administration support for more stimulus measures and time to write a deficit plan. His allies included political advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe, who saw a commission's appeal to independent voters.
Mr. Summers had backing from Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, who shared others' concerns that a commission might box the president in with proposals he could not support or pass. Also opposed were legislative aides, who channeled the objections of Congressional Democratic leaders to a panel they could not control.
But the president, by all accounts, still favored the idea, arguing it was the only way to get Republicans to accept tax increases and Democrats to support savings in entitlement programs. Ultimately, the White House was backed into creating a panel: it was the price moderate Democrats exacted to raise the debt limit that winter so the nation could keep borrowing to pay its bills.
On Feb. 18, 2010, Mr. Obama signed an executive order creating a panel of 18 lawmakers and outsiders, without the support of Congressional leaders of either party. Weeks earlier he had endorsed bipartisan legislation establishing a commission, but the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, and six other Republican co-sponsors of the bill then switched course to help defeat it. Their reversal was seared in Mr. Obama's memory, aides say, and later would influence his decision not to adopt the commission report, lest he spoil it as a basis for compromise.
An Ambitious Plan
When the commission finished nine months later, the political landscape had been upended by Republicans' takeover of the House.
On Dec. 1, 2010, Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson unveiled an ambitious package of spending cuts and revenue increases that was supported two days later by 11 of the 18 commissioners -- five from each party, including all three conservative Senate Republicans, and an independent business executive. While three votes short of the 14 needed to force a Congressional vote, it raised hopes that the blueprint could lead to compromise between Mr. Obama and Republicans.
But all three House Republicans on the panel opposed the plan. One was Mr. Ryan, a darling of small-government conservatives and a Republican with presidential ambitions, who was about to become chairman of the Budget Committee.
For all of its subsequent import, Mr. Obama's initial response to Bowles-Simpson was little debated at the White House, aides say. Not one adviser supported embracing it.
The plan called for more revenues and deeper military cuts than Mr. Obama supported. If he were to adopt it, aides worried, Republicans would assail him not only for raising taxes on all Americans but also for cutting Medicare -- this after a campaign in which Republicans had successfully attacked the Medicare savings in the health care law. Advisers also saw no prospect that Mr. Obama's endorsement would prompt the newly empowered, Tea Party-inspired Republicans to compromise.
And economic stimulus was the main concern as a lame-duck Congress met that December. The administration, fearful of another recession, wanted tax cuts for workers and small businesses and continued unemployment assistance, while Republicans needed a deal to force Mr. Obama to extend the Bush-era tax cuts on the wealthy, due to expire on the last day of the year.
''The White House's focus was totally, rightly, on making sure that we bought that recession insurance,'' Mr. Summers said.
On Dec. 3, Mr. Obama issued a statement praising the commission and promising to review its work. Yet his priorities seemed clear. ''Jobs and growth are our most urgent need,'' he said, before nodding to deficit reduction.
Republicans and conservative commentators would accuse Mr. Obama of pandering to his liberal base; centrist Democrats would call the moment a missed opportunity, when Mr. Obama should have put down his fiscal marker.
''There were lots of ways he could have grasped hold of it and used the fact that we had Republican support for it -- and even conservative Republicans' support -- without completely walking away from it,'' Mr. Bowles said.
Mr. Simpson was similarly disappointed. But he said Mr. Obama's endorsement would never have won over Republicans, and might have been toxic. When it comes to Mr. Obama, Mr. Simpson said, ''Their venom is even better than rattlesnake fangs.''
Debate Over Emphasis
In early January, with Mr. Obama's State of the Union address and annual budget request weeks away, aides debated what more he might say.
They agreed his emphasis would be on ''winning the future'' -- a new slogan for investments in education, infrastructure and technology. But officials recall economic advisers like Jacob J. Lew, then the budget director, pressing Jon Favreau, the chief speechwriter, for more on deficit reduction.
Opposition from Congressional Democrats scotched economic advisers' idea of proposing to change the cost-of-living formula for Social Security, something Bowles-Simpson had urged. And Mr. Favreau pushed back to keep the speech broad, with support from Mr. Axelrod, and finally Mr. Obama.
''From the very beginning, we were very much supportive of the direction of Bowles-Simpson, but we had some reservations on specifics,'' Mr. Lew said. Had Mr. Obama adopted its proposed $1 trillion in military savings over 10 years and $2 trillion in revenues, he said, ''it would have been explosive'' to Republicans.
But in hindsight, some advisers say Mr. Obama perhaps should have moved earlier to seize the high ground on deficit reduction and outline the proposals he would unveil in April. Other advisers say the administration simply was not ready. It was locked in a war over 2011 spending with Republicans, who threatened to shut down the government.
That spring, Mr. Ryan produced his budget, which had little in common with the Bowles-Simpson plan. Indeed, Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson objected that it would spare the military, weaken the safety net and slash taxes so much that deficits would persist for decades. Opponents staged protests, and Republicans, already dropping in polls, were fighting a losing battle for a special House election that turned on opposition to a Ryan proposal to make Medicare a voucher system.
At the White House, the Republicans' troubles raised hopes for eventual compromise.
Mr. Daley, the new chief of staff, opened private lines to leading Republicans. Mr. Obama traded calls with Senator Tom Coburn, one of Congress's most conservative Republicans, a member of the Bowles-Simpson majority who had joined a bipartisan ''Gang of Six'' senators struggling to write its recommendations into legislation.
Days before the House passed the Ryan budget, Mr. Obama unveiled his deficit-reduction framework at George Washington University. Loosely based on Bowles-Simpson, it similarly called for up to $4 trillion in savings, over 12 years instead of 10; for a ratio of $2 in spending cuts for every $1 of revenues; for all spending to be on the table, including military and entitlement programs, and for strict budget rules.
He proposed to ''build on the fiscal commission's model'' -- slashing popular tax breaks ''so that there's enough savings to both lower rates and lower the deficit.'' But Mr. Obama, who to date has suggested few specifics, would raise fewer new revenues than Bowles-Simpson because he refuses to increase taxes on those who make less than $250,000 annually, though many economists say all Americans will have to pay more eventually. Despite liberals' opposition, Mr. Obama called for unspecified changes in Social Security to ensure its long-term solvency. And he directed Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to negotiate with Congress.
What captured attention, however, was his attack on the Ryan plan.
''My naivete was thinking, O.K., we'll put our budget out there first and then he'll loosen up and start coming to us and we'll really start talking,'' Mr. Ryan recalled. ''And what we got was the back of his hand.''
Mr. Ryan bolted from the hall after the speech. Mr. Sperling ran after him to explain that the Obama team had not known he would attend and had not set him up to witness the attack. ''You just poisoned the well,'' Mr. Ryan snapped.
Mr. Obama, now hopeful, aides said, that he had set the stage for compromise, met the next day with Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson. Both had been in the audience. ''What did you think?'' he asked, according to Mr. Simpson. ''I thought it was harsh,'' Mr. Bowles said.
''I didn't think I was,'' Mr. Obama replied.
''I thought it was like inviting a guy to his own hanging,'' Mr. Simpson said.
A Deal Collapses
After a golf game in June, Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner began secret talks.
In a few weeks, they seemed within a handshake of a potentially historic deal. Mr. Obama offered more than ever before, including changes in the Social Security cost-of-living formula and slowly raising Medicare's eligibility age to 67, an idea that went beyond Bowles-Simpson. Mr. Boehner would support $800 billion in 10-year revenues.
But in a drama that transfixed the world amid threats of an American default, the talks collapsed, revived and finally died.
Mr. Obama, in early August, accepted a smaller deficit-reduction package with only spending cuts to secure Republican votes to raise the debt limit. A ''super-committee'' charged with finding more savings failed last fall, setting in motion $1.2 trillion in automatic cuts beginning in January 2013 unless the two sides identify alternative savings.
Since then, in speeches around the country, Mr. Obama has emphasized job-creation spending and tax cuts more than deficit reduction. Gone from his still-pending legislation are some of the concessions he offered Mr. Boehner -- presumably in reserve for the elusive grand bargain.
At their recent lunch, Mr. Obama assured Mr. Bowles he would not give up. Mr. Bowles said the president talked of seeing ''a real opportunity'' for compromise after the election, when Republicans will be eager to avoid the expiration of Bush tax cuts and automatic cuts in military spending -- suggesting another chance for a deal inspired by Bowles-Simpson.
''To see his commitment,'' Mr. Bowles said, ''gave me real hope.''

HEADLINE: Santorum Makes Case For Religion In Public Sphere

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO; Reporting was contributed by Viv Bernstein and Ashley Parker from Daytona Beach, Fla.; Jim Rutenberg from New York; and Katharine Q. Seelye from Marquette, Mich.

 BODY:
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. -- With two days left before the high-stakes Republican primaries in Arizona and Michigan, Rick Santorum delivered a full-throated defense of religion in public life on Sunday, appealing to the social conservatives who have revived his presidential campaign.
In an escalation of the sometimes fiery language that he has used throughout the race, Mr. Santorum declared that colleges were no longer a ''neutral setting'' for people of faith and described how he had become sickened after reading John F. Kennedy's 1960 speech calling for the rigid separation of religion and politics.
''What kind of country do we live in that says only people of nonfaith can come into the public square and make their case?'' Mr. Santorum said on the ABC News program ''This Week.''
''That makes me throw up,'' he said, adding later, ''I don't believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute.'' 
His rival Mitt Romney, who has struggled to persuade conservatives of his ideological commitment, made his own, subtler case to the same constituency on Sunday. He traveled to Florida to visit the site of the Daytona 500 Nascar race, long a favorite of conservative Republican voters, after having disputed what he said was the misconception that, as a former governor of Massachusetts, ''I can't be conservative.''
''But, you know, if you look at my record in Massachusetts, I'm a solid conservative -- a committed conservative with the kind of principles I think America needs,'' Mr. Romney said on Fox News Sunday, ticking off his record of cutting taxes, enforcing illegal immigration laws and opposing same-sex marriage.
The vigorous last-minute overtures underscored how much the focus of the contest had swung from economic issues to social concerns, even in states that have suffered during the financial crisis as much as Michigan and Arizona have.
Polls shows the candidates running roughly even in Michigan, as well as nationally, and the question for both of them is how Mr. Santorum's provocative and assertive outreach to the religious right will resonate with voters, both in the contests this week and in the dozen on ''Super Tuesday'' on March 6.
The two leading Republicans are trading increasingly caustic and personal attacks as they challenge the depth of the other's conservatism. Mr. Romney has portrayed Mr. Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, as a creature of Washington who was willing to compromise his beliefs to vote for the federal No Child Left Behind law and to back the 2004 re-election of Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, a supporter of abortion rights.
Mr. Santorum has accused Mr. Romney of lacking an ideological backbone, pointing to his previous support of abortion rights and to the heath care plan he enacted in Massachusetts. ''I don't understand what team he's on,'' Mr. Santorum said on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday. ''It's not the same team that I'm on.''
For Mr. Romney, the stakes are especially high on Tuesday. A loss in Michigan would represent a searing setback in his home state and would reinforce the sense that the party's rank and file is unwilling to come together behind him.
For Mr. Santorum, a defeat could threaten to sap the energy that he has built with victories over Mr. Romney in Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri. In a sign of his potential staying power, he will get Secret Service protection, starting within the next few days,
On a day when both candidates vied for the affections of conservative voters, it was Mr. Santorum's language that stood out.
Appearing on ''This Week,'' Mr. Santorum was asked about several of his recent comments, including why he derided President Obama -- whom he called a ''snob'' -- for encouraging all Americans to attend college.
''There are lot of people in this country that have no desire or no aspiration to go to college, because they have a different set of skills and desires and dreams,'' Mr. Santorum said.
Mr. Santorum also suggested that social conservatives are under assault on college campuses. ''We have some real problems at our college campuses with political correctness,'' he said.
In that interview, Mr. Santorum defended his criticism of Kennedy's famous speech about separation of church and state.
''The idea that the church can have no influence or no involvement in the operation of the state is absolutely antithetical to the objectives and vision of our country,'' Mr. Santorum said.
Kennedy, then a presidential candidate, gave the speech to quiet claims that he would answer to the Vatican because he was a Roman Catholic. Mr. Santorum is also a Catholic.
Mr. Romney had to defend himself against a new wave of complaints that he was out touch because of his remark in the economically depressed city of Detroit on Friday that his wife, Ann, owned a ''couple of Cadillacs.''
Asked about it on Fox News, Mr. Romney said simply, ''I just am who I am.''
''If people think that there is something wrong with being successful in America, then they better vote for the other guy,'' he said.
Still, his campaign seemed sensitive to the caricature of Mr. Romney as a multimillionaire who is disconnected from ordinary voters. It arranged for him to mingle for two hours with fans and drivers at the Daytona International Speedway in Florida. He recalled driving (''sometimes a little fast'') up and down the streets near his home in Michigan, which he playfully likened to an illegal racetrack.
Mr. Romney's Florida trip might have seemed like an odd, if confident, detour from states that will be voting on Tuesday. But Michigan has an ample share of Nascar fans. And the campaign hoped that images of Mr. Romney at the speedway would circulate widely through the Southern states that vote on March 6.
But the crowd initially booed Mr. Romney, who occasionally struck a discordant note, as when he approached a group of fans wearing plastic ponchos. ''I like those fancy raincoats you bought,'' he said. ''Really sprung for the big bucks.'' And when asked if he was a fan of the sport, he mentioned that ''I have some great friends who are Nascar team owners.''
Although he was not in Daytona, Mr. Santorum will have a presence at the race, which was postponed until Monday: his campaign has sponsored car No. 26, a Ford driven by Tony Raines. Mr. Santorum, on ''This Week,'' said he had spoken with Mr. Raines about a race-day strategy that seemed to mirror his own. ''I'm hoping that for the first, you know, maybe 300, 400 miles,'' Mr. Santorum said, ''he's sitting way, way back, letting all the other folks crash and burn, and then sneak up at the end and win this thing.''

HEADLINE: Blackstone Makes $2 Billion Natural Gas Investment

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: The investment will help Cheniere Energy build a facility in Sabine Pass, La., where natural gas will be compressed, chilled and shipped to Europe, Asia and other foreign markets on giant ships. 

 BODY:
Sending natural gas halfway across the world is no easy task. But it just got a little easier, thanks to the Blackstone Group.
The private equity behemoth announced on Monday that it had made a $2 billion equity investment in Cheniere Energy Partners, an outpost of Cheniere Energy, the Houston-based energy company. The investment will help the company build a facility in Sabine Pass, La., where natural gas will be compressed, chilled and shipped to Europe, Asia and other foreign markets on giant ships.
"Obtaining this financing will be a significant milestone for the advancement towards construction of the first two liquefaction trains," said Charif Souki, Cheniere's chief executive, in a statement announcing the transaction. "Blackstone is one of the world's largest private equity investors, with significant experience in the energy sector and a history of successful development of large scale energy projects. We look forward to a successful working relationship with Blackstone."
 Packaging natural gas for shipping, which requires expensive refrigeration and purification equipment to produce liquefied natural gas, has been a pet project of Mr. Souki's for years. After a boom in domestic natural gas production several years ago, he saw an opportunity to export natural gas from the United States to foreign markets, where supply is shorter and prices are higher.
"The arbitrage is so clear," Mr. Souki told The New York Times in 2011, referring to the differential between domestic prices for natural gas and the prices it can command abroad.
The first two liquefaction facilities Cheniere is building will cost a combined $4.5 billion to $5 billion, the company said in the announcement. Blackstone's investment of $2 billion will take the form of convertible units that will become common stock when the facilities begin commercial operation, which Cheniere expects to happen in 2016. Construction will begin in the first half of this year, the company said.
Blackstone has done business with Cheniere before, having financed a $250 million convertible debt security for the company in 2008. As part of the new deal, the private equity firm expects to appoint four directors to Cheniere Energy Partners' board of directors.
Blackstone's equity investment was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.
"We have been impressed with the vision and capability of Cheniere's management," said David I. Foley, the Blackstone executive overseeing the deal with Cheniere, in the release. 
Mr. Foley added that the investment would give Cheniere a "compelling opportunity to develop the first natural gas liquefaction export facility in the continental United States, creating thousands of jobs for American workers and providing significant benefits to the local economy and the State of Louisiana."

HEADLINE: New Magazine Aims for 'Luxury Customers'

BYLINE: AMY CHOZICK


HIGHLIGHT: Du Jour, a new digital and print magazine that is expected to be introduced in the fall, will be aimed at 235,000 deep-pocketed readers. 

 BODY:
Do you have a net worth of $5 million? A house worth more than $1.5 million? An average income of more than $250,000? And an affinity for bargain hunting?
If you answered yes, then, aside from being extremely lucky, you're just the reader for Du Jour, a new digital and print magazine. The publication comes from Jason Binn, founder of luxury magazines like Hamptons, Ocean Drive, Gotham and Aspen Peak, and a chief adviser of the Gilt Groupe, which offers online bargains on luxury goods.
Mr. Binn, in collaboration with Gilt Groupe and Hudson News, has devised a data analysis system that aims to cull three million high-end subscribers who sign up to receive a weekly Du Jour e-mail newsletter.
A quarterly lifestyle luxury magazine expected to be introduced in the fall will be mailed to 235,000 readers who fit the publisher's high-end criteria (as per above). An additional 15,000 print copies will be sold on newsstands. The digital editions will allow readers to click and buy products and services featured in editorial spreads.

"We have three million fully engaged Gilt members," Mr. Binn said in an interview. "These are real shoppers spending hundreds of millions of dollars."
All this may sound painfully pre-recession, but strong advertising revenue at a handful of luxury magazines shows that marketers are still eager to pay for a targeted platform with which to reach the well-heeled.
Advertising revenue at W magazine increased 14.3 percent in the quarter that ended last Dec. 31, compared with the same period in 2010, according to the Association of Magazine Media. Departures, American Express's high-end magazine, had a 46.2 percent increase in advertising revenue in the same period, the association said. Earlier this month, Bloomberg started a new luxury glossy magazine called Bloomberg Pursuits.
Du Jour will aim at readers in cities like New York, Miami, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco. Half the editorial content in each issue will be focused on a local region. Seasonal editions in the Hamptons, Aspen and Sun Valley also will be available. A full-page ad in the print edition will cost $32,000, according to Du Jour's ad sales materials.
But it's not the sexy locales that make Du Jour unique, Mr. Binn said. Plenty of competitors home in on high-end cities, but Du Jour has access to Gilt Groupe's trove of subscribers, an online club of shoppers who already have an obsession with all-things name brand. (And yes, Mr. Binn said the uber-wealthy still like a good bargain. Who knew?)
In order to receive the magazine, readers must meet five of seven criteria, including donating $10,000 or more annually to philanthropic causes or offline luxury purchases of $100,000 or more annually.
"We can make sure they can really afford what they see," Mr. Binn said. "They love bargains but they're also big luxury customers."

HEADLINE: The Greenback Is Born

BYLINE: MARC EGNAL


HIGHLIGHT: To pay for the Civil War, Congress created the modern American currency. 

 BODY:
During the first two months of 1862 the finances of the federal government were in dire straits. The pressing question was, given the strength of special interests, would Congress have the courage to adopt the necessary legislation?
The financial situation could not have been more grim. The War Department could no longer pay the country's soldiers and sailors; generals hounded Washington for money. Government revenues, which came chiefly from the tariff, fell from an annual average of $60 million during the prewar years to $42 million once the war began. At the same time government spending, which typically had matched income, soared. By the summer of 1861 Salmon P. Chase, the secretary of the Treasury, needed $1 million a day to cover expenses; by the end of the year he needed twice that amount. 
The secretary's first recourse, in the spring of 1861, was to borrow from bankers at home and abroad. But foreign bankers spurned the beleaguered republic, while institutions in New York, Boston and Philadelphia subscribed only $100 million of the $150 million loan that Chase floated. In July 1861 Congress issued $50 million of unsecured Treasury notes, but their value fell when banks refused to accept the money at face value. Angered, Chase proposed a system of national banks. But he mapped out no plans for the immediate crisis. 
Instead, leadership came from a small group of Congressional Republicans, including
representatives Elbridge Spaulding and Thaddeus Stevens and Senator John Sherman of Ohio. Before the war these men had been strong advocates of the economic measures - such as a protective tariff and internal improvements - that marked the Republican Party. They now set forth a bold program: It began with printing $150 million of legal tender Treasury notes, which bankers and soldiers alike would receive in payment for their services. These bills would be supported by extensive taxes, including an income tax. Once those initiatives were in place, Congress would implement Secretary Chase's plan for a national banking system.
Spaulding, Sherman, Stevens and others who worked with them had a broad vision of American growth, built on a vibrant national economy with a strong central government. They extolled a harmonious nation of free farmers and manufacturers, with special interests kept in check by national laws. And they emphasized the need for sacrifice in the common cause: Spaulding, for example, made clear that the next step - heavy taxation - must soon follow the emission of Treasury notes. "Direct taxation, excises, and internal duties are new features within the United States," he remarked. "They will be heavy burdens on the people, but essential to sustain the circulation of demand Treasury notes. The tax-gatherer will be an unwelcome visitor to most people, but his face must soon be familiar." 
It would be worth it, they argued. Sherman explained how the new currency would benefit the nation, as well as allowing the government to pay its debts. "When you issue these $150,000,000 of currency," he said, "it will permeate all over this country; it will be the blood of the whole system . . . It will enable men to carry on their business and make their exchanges all over the country."
Opposition soon emerged to the first component of the program: the issuance of legal tender paper money. Democrats in Congress denounced the measure, fearing that the legislation encouraged the emergence of big government. It would "subjugate the States and the people perpetually to the Federal Government," one Ohio Democrat complained. Still, Democrats and "Unionists" made up only a fourth of Congress, and so were in no position to block the legislation.
More worrisome for Spaulding and Sherman was the influence of the Eastern banks, and the Republicans who spoke for these institutions. The influence of the bankers was particularly marked in the congressional delegations from New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont and Maine. The new legislation, financiers declared, violated the sanctity of contracts. They wanted the government to continue paying the interest on bonds in silver and gold - not paper. Financiers also denounced any initiative that might restrict the right of local banks to issue paper money, a common practice at the time. It was big source of their profits, after all: the big banks discounted these notes, taking a cut from every transaction. The major banks also issued their own currency, expanding their capacity to make loans. 
Congressmen who defended the interests of the banks argued that the law was unconstitutional and would "ruin the business prosperity of the country," as one put it. Although the banking interest was beaten back in the House, financiers gained a partial victory in the Senate: The upper house accepted the legal tender clause, but insisted that interest on bonds be paid in gold. "A doleful sound came up from the caverns of bullion brokers, and from the saloons of the associated banks," reported Thaddeus Stevens. "Their cashiers and agents were soon on the ground, and persuaded the Senate, with but little deliberation, to mangle and destroy what it had cost the House months to digest, consider and pass . . . It makes two classes of money - one for the banks and brokers and another for the people." When delegates from the two houses conferred, the Senate version prevailed. The bill that Lincoln signed on Feb. 25, 1862, issued $150 million in legal tender notes but provided that the interest on bonds would be paid in gold. 
The new bills, soon called "greenbacks" from the distinct color of their ink, were widely accepted. This measure, however, was but the first act of an economic drama that would continue during the war - and in the years that followed. In July 1862 the Income Tax Act became law, and in February 1863 Lincoln signed the National Banking Act. In 1866 punitive taxes finally forced local banks to withdraw their notes.
So did Congress in early 1862 have the courage and will to adopt the needed legislation? Clearly, only in part. The lawmakers had addressed the issue and taken an important step forward. The battle to shape the nation's finances had been joined, not concluded.

HEADLINE: Is Corporate Debt Worth Subsidizing?

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Two finance professors at the University of Chicago say corporate debt among weaker companies, by hastening bankruptcy for inevitable failures, is a social good that can merit encouragement. 

 BODY:
Americans have always treated debt as a favorite vice. We like to borrow and we like to cluck at borrowers. But lately the balance has tilted toward clucking. Debt is in ill repute.
And that is why you should read this contrarian paper from two professors at the University of Chicago, arguing not only that borrowing is good, but that borrowing is so good that it should be heavily subsidized by the federal government.
The paper, it should be said, is about corporations. It seems to me that some of the most interesting implications are for large banks and mortgages. More on that point at the end of this post. But first the article itself:
The authors write that debt is good because it hastens inevitable failures.
That borrowing hastens failure is widely accepted, but it is generally taken as a bad thing. The Obama administration, to take a timely example, suggested in its recent proposals for corporate tax reform that the government should reduce subsidies for borrowing to limit failures.
"A tax system that is more neutral towards debt and equity will reduce incentives to overleverage and produce more stable business finances, especially in times of economic stress," the administration said.
But the authors of the new paper, Zhiguo He and Gregor Matvos of the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago, note that when failure is inevitable, it is best for society if it happens as quickly as possible.

Take an industry - say, makers of telephones - that is in decline. There are three factories, but only enough business for two. The sooner one factory closes, the better for the other two, and the quicker that its resources, including its employees, can turn to more productive work.
And all things equal, the factory with the most debt is likely to close first. The people who own companies do not have the same interests as the people who lend them money. Indeed, the more they borrow, the more they owe, the greater the potential benefits of filing for bankruptcy.
"In sharp contrast to much of the previous literature, we emphasize that the conflict of interest between debt and equity can be socially desirable," the authors write. "Debt financing generates welfare by facilitating efficient exit."
Without trying to summarize the whole paper, it's worth noting that this argument rests on several assumptions that warrant further scrutiny.
The argument is strongest if weaker firms borrow more than stronger ones. But clearly this is not always the case. Some research shows that private equity firms, for example, prefer to acquire companies with above-average earnings, according to a recent overview of the subject by Eileen Appelbaum, an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research (no relation to me).
It also glides over the difference between declining industries like telephone makers and those facing temporary shocks, like airlines after 9/11. High levels of debt leave companies equally vulnerable in both cases, but society doesn't benefit if companies with long-term prospects cannot survive short-term setbacks.
Third, such an argument rests on its evidence that government subsidies are necessary to produce the desired outcomes. I will leave it to others to evaluate the elaborate proofs offered for this assertion.
And now a final point, circling back to the very beginning. This is not just a paper about the benefits of debt. It is a paper about the beneficial combination of debt and bankruptcy. It is the ability to escape from debts, according to the paper, that makes borrowing worth subsidizing in the first place.
Which raises a question: Why should not the same logic apply to large banks and homeowners? The government offered heavy subsidies to encourage borrowing by both groups, but neither one has been allowed to fail.
The government chose to bail out the banking industry rather than penalizing its bondholders. And federal law prohibits homeowners from erasing mortgage debts in bankruptcy. In both cases, by encouraging borrowing without bankruptcy, the government accelerated the inevitable - right into a brick wall where the exit should have been. We're still living with the consequences.

HEADLINE: Michael Douglas Tackles Greed for F.B.I.

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: The actor, who played the infamous Gordon Gekko in "Wall Street," taped a public service announcement for the agency, emphasizing the illegality of insider trading. 

 BODY:
Gordon Gekko is cooperating with the F.B.I.
No, there's not another big-budget Oliver Stone follow-up to "Wall Street" in the works. Instead, Michael Douglas, who played the financier in the 1987 movie and the sequel, is now starring in a straight-to-television video for the Federal Bureau of Investigation meant to root out insider trading - the same crime that brought down the high-flying Mr. Gekko.
A one-minute spot that points out that illicit trading is, in fact, illegal might not seem a priority. But the new video - now showing on CNBC and Bloomberg Television - is part of the government's broader initiative aimed at drawing cooperating witnesses and tipsters from Wall Street.
 For years, insider trading was not a top focus at the bureau, so would-be informants might not have known where to turn, the thinking went. Now that the crime is front-and-center for securities investigators, the video is part reminder, part plea for those who have seen something illegal to say something.
"The movie was fiction, but the problem is real," Mr. Douglas, sans the slicked-back hair that his character sported, says in the announcement, which was unveiled on Monday. "If a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is."
The video, shot last November in the Trump Hotel in Manhattan, is also an effort to raise the F.B.I.'s public profile. Or, as David A. Chaves, a supervisor and special agent, said on Monday, "It's important for us to have the F.B.I. brand out on Wall Street."
For years, the bureau toiled in relative obscurity as federal prosecutors received praise for winning convictions in white-collar cases. Time magazine recently had Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, on its cover with the headline, "This Man Is Busting Wall Street."
Yet there are a number of government agencies ferreting out wrongdoing on Wall Street, from the F.B.I. to the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators. To build their cases, investigators are using aggressive tactics once reserved for organized crime and terrorism cases, such as wiretaps and well-placed cooperators.
Add to that arsenal their newest weapon: publicity, compliments of Mr. Douglas.
And, as the F.B.I. noted on Monday, what better spokesman against insider trading than Mr. Gekko, who came to personify Wall Street crime in both the 1980s and in the recent financial crisis with the 2010 sequel, "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps."
"The more people out there aware of the problem, the more opportunities we have to get tips," said Richard T. Jacobs, a supervisory special agent at the F.B.I. who helped bring the Galleon Group insider trading case, which resulted in the conviction of the billionaire hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam.
The latest federal operation, an outgrowth of the Galleon investigation, is called Perfect Hedge. It has already yielded 64 arrests and ensnared other big names in the hedge fund world. That effort, F.B.I. agents said Monday, is likely to continue for years to come as the network of sources they have developed multiplies and more tips flow in.
But the intense focus on insider trading has drawn criticism from outsiders, who call it a distraction from more important crackdowns. On the heels of the financial crisis, which crippled the global economy, the government has filed few cases tied to wrongdoing at the major banks and lenders that prompted the upheaval.
The idea to create a public service announcement about insider trading began last year, as the bureau worked to broaden the network of potential tipsters on Wall Street. Without a budget to throw cash at the project, the F.B.I. lined up a free production team and several networks that were willing to show their appeal.
And who might star in such a video? "I thought there was only one person to do it," said Mr. Chaves, who came up with the idea. Mr. Douglas, he said, is "such a revered man in Hollywood and I think just a wonderful person."
Mr. Douglas, 67, who two decades ago said Gordon Gekko was the best role he ever had, obliged. The actor, who recently underwent treatment for throat cancer, felt he needed to set the record straight about insider trading, Mr. Chaves said.
In the wake of the popularity of the first "Wall Street," Mr. Douglas would receive high-fives and handshakes from real-life traders and bankers when he walked the streets of Manhattan. The Wall Streeters loved Mr. Gekko, who declares in the film that "greed, for lack of a better word, is good."
But the outpouring of love for such a character befuddled Mr. Douglas, who won a best-actor Academy Award for his role in the first Wall Street film.
Mr. Douglas wondered why he was being thanked, according to Mr. Chaves, who quoted him as saying: "I'm a criminal in the movie. Don't they realize that?"

HEADLINE: More Affluent Students Are Choosing Community Colleges, Study Finds

BYLINE: LILY ALTAVENA


HIGHLIGHT: A study from Sallie Mae says that 22 percent of college students with a family income of over $100,000 opted for a community college last year. Four years ago, it was at 16 percent. 

 BODY:
Inside Higher Ed reported on a study from Sallie Mae that said 22 percent of college students with a family income of over $100,000 opted for a community college last year. Four years ago, it was at 16 percent. 
Stephen G. Katsinas, the director of the University of Alabama's Education Policy Center, attributed the rise to increasing acceptance of community colleges. Tuition is also significantly cheaper than a four-year university and allows students to live at home. These younger and more affluent students also expect a rich on-campus community, complete with updated facilities, the report said. 
The article profiled Raritan Valley Community College, located in suburban New Jersey, and quoted Casey Crabill, the college's president. The college has seen a 49 percent rise in students under 21 in the past five years, and is now working to accommodate their new population:
Raritan Valley has had plenty of recent success stories, including students who have transferred to Cornell University, the University of California at Berkeley and other high-profile institutions. Crabill said the publicity has helped convince more traditional students that the two-year college is a good choice. 
"Our profile peaked at the same time" that the recession began, she said.
The college has taken many steps to respond to the changing demographics on its main campus. To improve student amenities, college officials remodeled the cafeteria and expanded and updated the fitness center. The college also created a first year experience office and related programming. A new student life and leadership center is in the works, with a related fund-raising campaign launched in 2010.
The College Board recently published a study that said four out of five community college students want to transfer to a four-year institution.

HEADLINE: 10 Activities for Learning About Leap Year and Other Calendar Oddities

BYLINE: PATRICK HONNER and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Ways to learn about leap day and the intricacies of how the calendar works. 

 BODY:
It's 2012, which means it's leap year. And leap day, Feb. 29, is upon us. 
For this occasion, we bring you 10 ways to learn about and work with the calendar and to make leap day a teachable moment. 
1. Pick a Date, any Date 
You've probably noticed that your birthday falls on a different day of the week each year. This is because a calendar year does not consist of a whole number of weeks. 
Each normal calendar year has 365 days, which means there are 52 full weeks and one extra day. If there were exactly 52 weeks between birthdays, your birthday would be on the same day of the week every year, but that extra day knocks the cycle out of sync. 
For example, under normal circumstances, if your birthday was a Monday one year, it would fall on a Tuesday the next year. Leap years change the equation. If there is a leap day between your birthdays, then the cycle is off by two days. Thus, if your last birthday before this leap day was on a Monday, your first birthday after the leap year will be on a Wednesday.
Make sense? Test yourself by trying to calculate the day of the week for specific days, like March 15, 2009, or July 21, 2007. Look at the front page of the New York Times from that day to see if you calculated correctly. Hint: The further back in time you go, the more leap years, and thus, the more extra days there are to consider.
Go back more than 100 years and the math gets even more complicated. Usually a year is a leap year if it is divisible by four, like 2012, or 1992. But leap year gets canceled every hundred years or so to keep the calendar in balance with Earth's orbit. 
So the rule, in reality, works like this: If the year is divisible by four, it's usually a leap year.
But there are exceptions. If the year is divisible by 100 but not by 400, it is not a leap year, and if the year is divisible by 400, then it is a leap year. You can read more about determining leap years on TimeandDate.com's leap year page.
In fact, this kind of calendar math is so challenging, a question on the 2012 American Mathematics Competition asked for day of the week Charles Dickens was born, the date being Feb. 7, 1812. See if you can figure out the answer, and check your answer on Wolfram Alpha. Then explore the many formulas and algorithms for computing the day of the week for any date in history.
2. Calendar Reform
Suffering from calendar confusion? Tired of leap years, leap days and leap seconds? You're not alone. The astronomer Richard Conn Henry and the economist Steve Hanke have proposed a new calendar that stays the same every year. The Hanke-Henry calendar employs a 364-day year and a "mini-month" every few years that balances the cosmic equation. 
And this isn't the first try at calendar reform. Check out these articles from The New York Times's archives: from 1922, a proposal of a 364-day year and "Freaks of the Calendar," which shows that calendar confusion has been around since at least 1892. Now, write an Op-Ed pieceproposing your own solution to calendar confusion. 
3. Happy Birthdays
How rare is a leap day birthday? If we assume that every day is equally likely to be a birthday, the probability that a person's birthday is a non-leap-day (say, Aug. 18) would be 1 out of 365, or about 0.27 percent. We can calculate the probability of a leap day birthday thus: 

        
Assume one leap day every four years.
        
In four years, there are 365 * 4 + 1 = 1,461 total days.
        
The probability of a leap day birthday would be around 1 /1,461, or 0.068 percent.
Take a poll in your school to find out everyone's birth date; collect the data and make a chart. What are the most common birthdays in your school? The least common? Does each day represent 0.27 percent of the total school population? Are there any general trends? And does anyone have an elusive leap day birthday?
4. The Final Frontier
Leap year on Earth arises because of the strange relationship between the length of our year (Earth's rotation around the sun) and the length of our day (Earth's rotation about its axis). But what do the days and years look like on other worlds in our galaxy? 
Get more information about the orbits of the planets, and their days and years. Explore the calendar of Mars and try to figure out a suitable calendar for the Martian year. And if you think the year and day on Mars is strange, be sure to check out Mercury. 
You can even calculate your age on Jupiter and other planets.
5. One Small Leap
Recently, 700 delegates from 70 nations met in Geneva to decide whether to keep or abolish the "leap second," an extra second tacked on once every few years to synchronize atomic clocks with Earth's rotational cycle. 
Explore the reasons for and against this time-keeping convention and how the U.S. Atomic Clock works to keep standard time and consider your own position on the leap second. (The result of the international meeting was to postpone the decision for three years, so you've got time to make up your mind.)
On a somewhat related note, you can also take on the question of daylight saving time and various nations' policies on the subject as well as how it plays a role in our understanding of time.
6. Calendar Calculations
Leap day is just one of many mathematically interesting opportunities to explore the calendar. Another is palindrome days, which occur when the date, written as a series of numbers, can be read the same backward and forward. For example, Nov. 2, 2011, was a palindrome day, as the numeric date 11/02/2011 (or 11022011) reads the same forward and backward. How rare are palindrome days? When will the next palindrome day occur?
Another interesting oddity is the permutation day which occurs when the year can be rearranged to form the day and the month. For example, Feb. 12, 2011, is a permutation day, since 2012 can be rearranged to form 02 and 12. When is the next permutation day? How often do they occur?
Play with the calendar and invent your own mathematical holidays, like pi day, or explore other calendar math like the number of Friday the 13ths that occur each year.
7. Show Me the Money
Many workers are paid yearly salaries, which means they earn a set amount of money per calendar year. Since salaries are typically not adjusted for leap year, this means that, during a leap year, an employee will probably end up working one extra day for the same yearly salary.
How much does this "free day" affect your daily wages? Check out average yearly salaries for positions like an architect in New York City, and calculate the average daily pay by dividing the yearly salary by 365. Divide the salary by 366 to compute the average daily pay for a leap year, and compare. How much does leap year cost workers? 
It's not all bad news, though. Rental payments are typically made on a monthly basis, too. Check out the monthly costs of real estate rentals in your area. How much is that rent-free day in February worth?
8. What a Difference a Day Makes
Use this extra 24 hours to think about just how much happens every single day, and different ways to quantify a day. 
For example, how much do companies earn on a daily basis? Check out the financials on companies like Apple, Netflix or Ford, and calculate their daily revenues, net income and labor costs.
Or think of a single day in terms of population. How many births, deaths, and divorces occur every day in the United States? Check out data at the Census Bureau and calculate how much the population changes from day to day.
Yet another way to parse a day is to quantify how people spend their time and analyze trends in the data.
9. The More Things Change ...
Look at The New York Times from the last leap day, Feb. 29, 2008, which included coverage of Barack Obama's presidential aspirations, the increasing number of homeowners walking away from their mortgages and the uneasy relationship between the United States and Pakistan. Use Times Topics to do some research and get up to date on the issues, and and write a follow-up article to your chosen story. Then, find a story from this year's leap day New York Times and look into the future to write a follow-up for next leap day.
10. Take Your Own Leap
Some people like to think of leap day as a quadrennial gift, a free 24 hours that exists outside our normal routines. Find a way to use your free day to do something different. The City Room blog asks, "How Will You Spend Your Extra 24 Hours?" and posts answers found in The Times from 1892 to 1972. They invite you to tell them what you'll do by commenting on the post.
Other ideas? Get a recommendation for a new book to read, or a new (or old) movie to see. Read about a new place you haven't yet been, or explore new ideas that you haven't yet learned. Take a leap!

HEADLINE: Answers to Reader Questions on Knicks' Chemistry

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Howard Beck, the N.B.A. reporter for The Times, answers questions from readers. 

 BODY:
Howard Beck, who covers the N.B.A. for The Times, answers questions from readers.
Q.
A.
The Knicks have done a great job of accumulating talent - some high-priced, some bargain-priced - over the last two years. But I wouldn't get too carried away with the value premise. Amar'e Stoudemire is not earning anywhere close to his $18 million salary right now, and his contract is uninsured because of past injuries, making him nearly untradeable. Tyson Chandler has been a fantastic addition, but I know some team executives who consider him overpriced at $54 million over four years. In all likelihood, Fields and Lin will re-sign for about $5 million each this summer. That will put the Knicks very close to the luxury-tax threshold, limiting their ability to sign free agents under the new labor deal. In the future, luxury-tax teams will have even more restrictions placed on them. So the Knicks need to get every ounce of production out of the group they have because they won't have much flexibility in the coming years.
Q.
 Simon Eng, New York City
A.
At one time, it seemed a given that the Knicks would chase Nash this summer, or pursue Felton as a backup plan if Nash signed elsewhere. But Lin's emergence (assuming he can sustain the momentum) means the Knicks no longer have a glaring need at point guard. Also, re-signing Lin will require using the midlevel exception, which probably eliminates the Knicks from pursuing another major free agent. The only other exception they will have available is the biannual exception (about $1.9 million). Otherwise, they can sign players only to minimum salaries.
Q.
 Steve, New York
A.
I believe this will be one of the great philosophical questions of our time. But why stop there? Maybe Jeremy can do some acting and get a SAG card, too? Buy a home in Sag Harbor?
Q.
Matt Barbarasch, New York
A.
Unquestionably, Mike D'Antoni and his staff deserve major credit for Lin's ascendance and the Knicks' revival. In fact, D'Antoni and Lin have been perfect for each other: D'Antoni's system has given Lin a perfect platform to shine, and Lin in turn has brought D'Antoni's offense back to life. Overlooked, too, is that D'Antoni gives his players great latitude on the court, which allows them to relax and work through their mistakes. He has given Lin the freedom to keep growing on the court, rather than obsessing over his high turnover count or his missed shots. As I've reported previously, D'Antoni was never in danger of being fired during the Knicks' January struggles; ownership is committed to keeping him through the end of the season. Whether he is brought back remains an open question and will most likely depend on the Knicks' playoff success. Best guess: he needs to make the second round to win a new contract. He has the strong support of several key players, most notably Lin, Amar'e Stoudemire, Tyson Chandler, Baron Davis and Jared Jeffries.
Q.
A.
The Knicks have a lot invested in Carmelo Anthony, both monetarily and otherwise. They are not going to jettison him after only a year. They need to see how good the Anthony-Stoudemire-Chandler-Lin lineup can be before making any hasty decisions. This franchise has gone through tremendous and continual upheaval in the last four years. What it needs now is stability.
Q.
A.
Dwight Howard's discontent with the Magic is well established at this point, and I'm not sure there's any way to reverse it. He wants what every superstar of this generation seems to want: a superstar teammate. The Magic do not have one, and I don't believe they have the means to acquire one before the trading deadline. Howard clearly wants to join Deron Williams, either in Brooklyn or Dallas.
Q.
Jonnygwiz, Oslo
A.
The simple answer is that the Knicks needed more 3-point shooting and athleticism on the perimeter. Smith, for all of his warts on and off the court, is a tremendous talent. He can play shooting guard and small forward, two spots at which the Knicks needed depth. He is a huge upgrade over Bill Walker and obviously more seasoned than Iman Shumpert. The Knicks needed insurance in the backcourt, given Shumpert's nagging knee injury and the uncertainty over Baron Davis's ability to recover fully from a back injury. All of that said, Smith is a wild card, both as a personality and as a player. There are concerns about his disrupting the Knicks' newfound chemistry, and the decision to sign him was not unanimous.
Q.
Yoshi Hill, New York
A.
I think it's much too soon to predict Lin's future, but I also believe we're way past the point of writing off his February breakout as some sort of aberration. Lin is a legitimate talent, one with great skill, athleticism and size (6 foot 3, 212 pounds) for his position and an indefatigable drive to keep improving. Any doubts about his ability to compete against elite teams should have been erased with the victories over the Mavericks and the Lakers. Lin obviously struggled against Miami, but the Heat are a uniquely versatile defensive team, and they clearly focused all of their energy on shutting Lin down. That is, in itself, a huge compliment. Lin is a virtual rookie, and he clearly has more growth ahead of him. But I think he has established himself as a long-term N.B.A. starter, at a minimum. Whether he can be a top-10 point guard or an All-Star remains to be seen, but I think he has the talent to get there.
In general, though, I view the question this way: We didn't see Lin coming, so we shouldn't assume too much about where he's going. We should just enjoy the ride.
Q.
Adam, New York
A.
I've been tweeting the Knicks' second-quarter lineups all season, as sort of a running gag to point out how awful the bench was. Lin's emergence has changed everything, eliminating the need to play Mike Bibby and Toney Douglas, or to use Shumpert at point guard, a position he is not yet ready for. Lin has made several players (notably Steve Novak and Jared Jeffries) better just by creating easier shots. And of course, with J.R. Smith and Baron Davis now playing, and Harrellson returning soon, the Knicks' bench is significantly improved. D'Antoni, who famously prefers a tight rotation, has openly mused about playing 10 guys in the second half of the season.
Q.
TMV, France
A.
I'll ask James Dolan the next time he speaks to reporters.
Q.
SportingTFC, New York
A.
It's an interesting question, but not one the Knicks (or the N.B.A.) really need to worry about. The Knicks will be able to pay Lin about $5 million in a starting salary - far beyond what the Chinese league teams generally pay. By comparison, Kenyon Martin's contract in China this season was reportedly valued at $2.6 million, which was described as a record. Beyond that, the fact is that American-born players want to play in the N.B.A., where the quality of play is the highest and the long-term rewards are the greatest. Assuming Lin remains a valuable player - and I believe he will -- I don't think there's any chance that he leaves New York.
Q.
Ernie, Bayside, N.Y.
Q.
Adam, New York
Q.
Back to Basics Rob, New York
A.
Clearly, there is much consternation about Carmelo these days - a profound change from a year ago, when most Knicks fans were delirious over the acquisition. It's well established that the trade with Denver was pushed through by Knicks ownership, over the concerns of Donnie Walsh and the basketball operations staff. The Knicks gave up too many assets, jammed their payroll for years to come and wed themselves to a player who had made it out of the first round only once in his career.
Anthony is a gifted and versatile scorer, among the best of his generation. He has the talent to fit into any style of offense if he is willing to commit to it. But Anthony has never been a willing passer (or defender), and he prefers to rely on his one-on-one skills rather than allow the offense to create easy shots - not only for him, but for everyone. It is up to Anthony to adapt and evolve if he ever wants to be known as more than a scorer, or to have any chance at winning a title. Otherwise, he'll just be remembered as a taller Allen Iverson.
Q.
Andrew, New York
A.
I don't see either one being traded any time soon. But as a practical matter, the answer is Carmelo. Amar'e is nearly impossible to trade because his contract is uninsured, due to a history of knee and eye injuries. He is owed $65 million over the next three seasons, which most teams view as a huge risk, especially in the new, tighter N.B.A. economy. The salary cap is stagnant, and the penalties for exceeding the luxury tax are becoming stiffer. Also, Stoudemire's production and efficiency are way down, raising concerns that he may be in decline.
Q.
Rmyklo, Main Line, Pa.
A.
First, thank you for giving me the 76ers. Best gift ever. For my first act as owner, I'm giving Collins a raise. He's a class act and an excellent coach. Love your question, too. History shows that with rare exceptions, superstars win titles. And, generally, the more stars, the better. I don't think my newly acquired team (and thanks again for that) can win it all with a cast of merely good-to-very-good players. That said, there are only a handful of truly transcendent players in the N.B.A. And with those players now conspiring to form superteams in a handful of cities, there are fewer stars left for the rest of the league. I'd love to see a team break through with a different approach, as the Pistons did in 2004. Last year's Mavericks showed that you can win a championship with a single superstar and a well-chosen cast of supporting players. Those teams provide some hope for a league that has too many franchises and not enough elite talent to go around. (Of course, as I say that, the Mavericks are quietly plotting to sign Deron Williams and Dwight Howard this summer to form their own superteam.)

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
Investigators Scrutinize MF Global Wire Transfers | Federal investigators examining the final days at MF Global and how customer money went missing are poring over scores of wire transfers in and out of the brokerage firm, including the possible movement of $325 million that may have belonged to customers, according to people briefed on the matter.
The suspicious transfer, which until now has not been made public, was first discovered in the early hours of Oct. 31, the day the firm filed for bankruptcy. Initially, MF Global attributed a shortfall of more than $1 billion in customer money to an "accounting error," records show. But after hours of searching, executives acknowledged to regulators in the firm's offices in Chicago that the shortfall was real - and may have been caused in part by the $325 million transfer, said one of the people briefed on the matter.
It remains unclear where that money went, or even if it belonged to customers. But it is one of many significant wire transfers that federal authorities - including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation - have spent months reviewing to piece together MF Global's final days.

HEADLINE: What is Facebook Worth? A View From India

BYLINE: PRASHANT AGRAWAL


HIGHLIGHT: What can a Mumbai taxi driver's Facebook use tell us about the company's value? 

 BODY:
I couldn't help but notice my taxi driver's spanking new Nokia phone on a recent ride in Mumbai.
No, he wasn't carrying the high-end Lumia "smart phone" (retail price about 30,000 rupees, or $611), but it certainly wasn't a basic phone either. It had a qwerty keyboard, wi-fi and Internet access. Pankaj, the taxi driver, said it cost him a cool 6,000 rupees, roughly a third of his monthly income.
Impressed, I asked him "What do you use the Internet for?"
"Facebook," he said.
"You are on Facebook?"
"Yes, of course."
"How much do you pay for net access?"
"99 rupees (about $2) a month."
For Pankaj, Facebook was the main reason to sign up for an Internet plan. While unlimited Internet plans in India cost north of 750 rupees a month ($15 a month), metered plans, or those based on downloaded amounts, start at 99 rupees for 1GB ($2 a month).
He isn't alone. Go onto most any mobile carrier's Web site in India and there is a social networking tab describing how to get onto Facebook. Facebook is prominently featured in many mobile carrier advertisements as a reason to get a data plan. One carrier, Vodafone, even introduced a phone that offered unlimited Facebook use for a year, free with the 3,810 rupee phone purchase.
With over 40 million users and growth of more than 1 million users per month, India is already Facebook's third-largest market. That growth, much like India's Internet usage, is coming not just at the top of the economic pyramid, but across it.
Facebook users represent one of the youngest and most attractive market segments in India. To reach this group in its entirety, companies have few options because of divisions in language and education. Pankaj may watch Hindi-language television shows, his wife may read Gujarati newspapers and neither may read a magazine. India's crowd-pleasing staples, Hindi movies and cricket, may be the only other ways, outside of Facebook, to reach this group.
And India is expected to surpass the United States as the largest Facebook user base sometime in the next five years.
As investors ponder the value of Facebook, users like Pankaj might be worth considering. After all, he earns approximately $300 a month and was willing to spend $2 a month to access the Internet, just to use Facebook. For him, like most of us, the Internet means access to knowledge, social interaction and entertainment. And for him, the portal to that access is Facebook. With long periods of downtime as he waits for fares, he uses Facebook to communicate with his friends, play games and "learn," he said.
When number crunchers try to evaluate the value of a Facebook user, one Holy Grail question has emerged: What if Facebook could charge its users $1 a month? With 750 million users that would lead to revenues of nearly $10 billion a year from user charges alone.
The question is purely hypothetical. Facebook's founders have long pledged that they won't charge its customers. After all, the company derives its power from its user base. But Pankaj shows that Facebook has become such an indispensable part of the lives of folks around the world that they are, in effect, willing to pay for it.
Reams have been written and will be written about the value of Facebook before its initial public offering later this year. Like Google in its early days, Facebook may not have figured out all the ways to monetize its massive customer base, but the view from India is clear - it has grabbed the interest, and the income of users, rich and poor alike.

HEADLINE: Bending the Tax Code, and Lifting A.I.G.'s Profit

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A.I.G. is unlikely to pay a cent of taxes this year, nor by some estimates, for at least a decade, thanks to a rule that the Treasury Department bent for several hobbled companies a few years ago. 

 BODY:
Last week, the American International Group reported a whopping $19.8 billion profit for its fourth quarter. It was a quite a feat for a company that was on its death bed just a little over three years ago, so sick that it needed a huge taxpayer bailout.
But if you dug into the numbers, it quickly became clear that $17.7 billion of that profit was pure fantasy - a tax benefit, er, gift, from the United States government. The company made only $1.6 billion during the quarter from actual operations. Yet A.I.G. not only received a tax benefit, it is unlikely to pay a cent of taxes this year, nor by some estimates, for at least a decade.
The tax benefit is notable for more than simply its size. It is the result of a rule that the Treasury unilaterally bent for A.I.G. and several other hobbled companies in 2008 that has largely been overlooked.
 This rule-twisting could deprive the government of tens of billions of dollars, assuming the firm remains profitable. The tax dodge -- and let's be honest, that's what it is -- also will most likely help goose the bonuses of A.I.G.'s employees, some of whom helped create many of the problems that led to its role in the financial crisis.
"We suggest that Congress give its members standing to challenge such manipulation in court," J. Mark Ramseyer, a Harvard professor, and Eric B. Rasmusen, a professor at Indiana University, wrote in a paper last year. The paper provocatively asked: "Can the Treasury Exempt Its Own Companies From Tax?" (While the paper addressed A.I.G, it focused on the tax treatment bestowed on another bailout recipient, General Motors. Citigroup, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also received similar treatment.)
Here's the back story: A.I.G.'s tax benefit comes in large part from its immense "net operating losses" during its depths of despair in 2008 before its rescue. The government had to dump $182 billion into the company after it was crippled by bad bets it had made insuring mortgage-backed securities.
The tax benefit comes in the form of something called net operating losses - NOLs in Wall Street parlance - that could be worth more than $25 billion, possibly more. Those losses can be very valuable, in part because companies can spread them over many years to lower or wipe out their income tax bills.
However, according to longstanding tax laws, if a company files for bankruptcy or is taken over, it loses the ability to use its net operating losses. A.I.G. would fit that profile perfectly: on the verge of bankruptcy, the federal government took control of A.I.G., exchanging its bailout billions for shares in the company. The government - taxpayers - still own 77 percent of the company, down from 92 percent three years ago.
Still, the Treasury issued "notices" exempting A.I.G. from losing its right to make use of its net operating losses. In total, the insurer estimated that those losses were worth $26.2 billion as of 2009, and it claimed almost $9 billion in other "unrealized loss on investments."
Analysts at Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase last year estimated that the tax benefits from the losses propped up A.I.G. stock by $5 to $6 a share. Its shares closed at $28.66 on Monday, just shy of the $29 mark that the government says it needs to sell its shares to break even.
A.I.G. believes that these losses are so valuable that it has a poison pill to bar a corporate takeover.
All of this brings us to the inevitable questions: How did this happen? Why would Treasury exempt A.I.G. from the law? And if taxpayers own a majority of A.I.G., aren't we the beneficiaries of the rule-bending?
A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment, as did a spokesman for A.I.G.
However, senior Treasury officials said privately that they had exempted A.I.G. because they did not consider the rescue to be a traditional takeover. The original law preventing companies from using the losses after a takeover were intended to prevent corporations from buying failing companies with lots of losses simply for the tax benefits.
Moreover, the officials said A.I.G.'s tax benefit would help taxpayers because it would raise the insurer's share price. That may be true, but that assumes that the government is able to sell its shares and exit its investment. That's still a big "if." (Though I do bet it will eventually happen.)
The tax break for A.I.G. also perversely benefits employees who are paid based on the company's performance and usually in stock, which is being lifted by this backdoor handout. The biggest beneficiary is Robert H. Benmosche, A.I.G.'s chief executive since 2009, who has been granted tens of thousands of shares.
In the meantime, the government - desperate to increase revenues - is missing an easy stream of guaranteed taxes from a company that taxpayers bailed out. Sure, the tax bill might hurt the price of A.I.G.'s stock price in the short term, but if Mr. Benmosche does his job right, the company won't have to post fantasy profits.
An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that under longstanding securities laws, a company that files for bankruptcy or is taken over loses the ability to use its net operating losses. Such rules are governed under tax rules.

HEADLINE: Life of a 'Salesman': An Online Discussion

BYLINE: CHARLES ISHERWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: Charles Isherwood kicks off an online discussion series on the history and significance of Arthur Miller's 1949 drama "Death of a Salesman." 

 BODY:
3:33 p.m. | Updated 
Attention will be paid.
For the next few weeks I'll be leading an online discussion here about the high hopes and hard life of one of the American theater's most famous characters. Willy Loman, and the play that immortalized him, Arthur Miller's 1949 classic "Death of a Salesman," are returning to Broadway in a new production starring Philip Seymour Hoffman.
It's a great chance to dust off old memories and old texts and to ask new questions. Does the play's implicit criticism of the American ideal of success feel compelling today? If you saw it years ago, maybe even in high school, will it still have the power to provoke?
I'll explore these questions and others with actors, directors, scholars and others. Please join the conversation by putting your ideas and questions into the comments section below, or tweet them using the hash tag #salesmanqs so that I can include them when I sit down with my guests.
I started with an essay in the Feb. 26 issue of Arts & Leisure exploring some of the reasons the play feels timely to me. This week I'll be joined by the Times business columnist Joe Nocera to talk about how it resonates in today's economic climate. We'll also be hearing from traveling salesmen, on whether they continue to feel that they're "out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine," as Charley's eulogy of Willy has it. 
Later on I'll talk to Mike Nichols, who directs the new production, about the influence of the original Elia Kazan production on the current one, which opens March 15. If you want to ask Mr. Nichols some questions, please pass them along. 
As is often the case with classic plays or novels we've lived with for most of our lives, "Death of a Salesman" can seem entirely different each time we renew our acquaintance with it. If your first exposure came in high school and you haven't read or seen it since, you may be surprised at stylistic innovations that barely registered at the time. Pick it up and see if the same thing happens for you. 
The debate the play ignited over whether a common man could properly be the subject of true tragedy has by now waned, with its stature in the canon having firmly answered in the affirmative. But given how often "Salesman" is produced - the last major New York revival, with Brian Dennehy, was in 1999 -- discussion remains lively about the actors who take these unforgettable parts. Was Dustin Hoffman -- so much smaller than Mr. Dennehy or Lee J. Cobb, who originated the role -- an ideal Willy? Please get ready to share memories of the production - or performance - that meant the most or taught you something new.
My own recent researches into the play brought fresh revelations. I was struck by Miller's confession that he laughed throughout its composition at Willy's contradictions and was slightly taken aback when audiences greeted the play as a profoundly sad one.
When I turned to the play I saw exactly where the humor resided and found myself laughing along with Miller. It is indeed funny how Willy can deride his son Biff as a "lazy bum" in one breath and three lines later emphatically tell his wife that "there's one thing about Biff - he's not lazy." These inconsistencies are, of course, what makes Willy such a consistently human character - and why we are still talking about him more than 50 years later. 
Readers, we've appreciated your comments. One request: Please don't give us your review of the current production yet. It's in previews and there are many of us who haven't seen it. We also think it's only fair to give the actors and directors a chance to iron out any kinks. Our critic will be there for opening night and after that we'll all talk and welcome your reviews. In the meantime, there are so many more topics to discuss.

HEADLINE: This Tribal Nation

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Economics, too. 

 BODY:
Digby sends us to Chris Mooney on how conservatives become less willing to look at the facts, more committed to the views of their tribe, as they become better-educated: 
For Republicans, having a college degree didn't appear to make one any more open to what scientists have to say. On the contrary, better-educated Republicans were more skeptical of modern climate science than their less educated brethren. Only 19 percent of college-educated Republicans agreed that the planet is warming due to human actions, versus 31 percent of non-college-educated Republicans.
...
But it's not just global warming where the "smart idiot" effect occurs. It also emerges on nonscientific but factually contested issues, like the claim that President Obama is a Muslim. Belief in this falsehood actually increased more among better-educated Republicans from 2009 to 2010 than it did among less-educated Republicans, according to research by George Washington University political scientist John Sides.
The same effect has also been captured in relation to the myth that the healthcare reform bill empowered government "death panels." According to research by Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan, Republicans who thought they knew more about the Obama healthcare plan were "paradoxically more likely to endorse the misperception than those who did not." 
What this made me think about was the way Christy Romer ended her excellent speech (pdf) laying out what we know about the effects of fiscal policy.:
The one thing that has disillusioned me is the discussion of fiscal policy. Policymakers and far too many economists seem to be arguing from ideology rather than evidence. As I have described this evening, the evidence is stronger than it has ever been that fiscal policy matters-that fiscal stimulus helps the economy add jobs, and that reducing the budget deficit lowers growth at least in the near term. And yet, this evidence does not seem to be getting through to the legislative process.
That is unacceptable. We are never going to solve our problems if we can't agree at least on the facts. Evidence-based policymaking is essential if we are ever going to triumph over this recession and deal with our long-run budget problems.
What Chris Mooney is telling us is that this is a vain hope. Highly educated political conservatives -- and this includes conservative economists -- are going to be persuadable by empirical evidence than the man or woman in the street. The more holes you poke in doctrines like expansionary austerity or supply-side economics, the more committed they will get to those doctrines.
This debate isn't going to be won by rational argument.

The Week's Bests
Lessons From Bad Reviews. Angie Hicks of Angie's List tells us what we can learn from customer reviews: "Look at bad reviews as the first step to seeking a solution. In our annual review of customer comments, we found that the companies most willing to reach out to clients submitting feedback are most likely to sport a top grade. Your customer interaction rarely has to end in irreconcilable differences. No matter the reviewer, an olive branch should always be extended when the forum allows such action."
Explanation for Bad Advice. Rajesh Setty wonders why smart people give bad advice: "I have seen this firsthand when highly accomplished and successful people come to talk at events without much preparation. Their reasoning - they have a 'wealth of experience' that they can draw upon so preparation is really optional. They mess up badly on their talk but they rarely get real feedback as to how badly they performed. This lack of real feedback gives them a feeling that everything is just fine and they continue on a slippery slope after that."
Ways to Improve Your E-mail Marketing. Justin Premick offers tips for getting customers to open newsletters, including: "Your subject line should convey what the e-mail is about while piquing subscribers' curiosity and interest, much as you would in a blog post title or sales page headline. You may find that certain types of subject lines, such as those that ask questions, tend to pull better response rates than others. However, don't fall into the trap of making all your subject lines feel the same; otherwise subscribers may decide that all your e-mails are the same and they don't need to open the one you just sent them."

HEADLINE: Stress-Testing Romney's Michigan Edge

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Our model gives Mitt Romney a four-point lead in Michigan - close enough that it is worth considering whether there are factors not being picked up by the polling. 

 BODY:
On Friday, Mitt Romney pulled into the lead in our polling-based forecasts of the Michigan Republican primary. The forecast model has now become more confident in that conclusion, in fact, because two new polls released on Sunday night also showed an advantage for Mr. Romney.
The new polls, from Public Policy Polling and We Ask America, gave Mr. Romney leads of two and four percentage points, respectively, over Rick Santorum. They join two other polls released after Wednesday's Republican debate, from Mitchell Research and Rasmussen Reports, that gave Mr. Romney leads of two points and six points, respectively.
There is less probability of an election night surprise when the polls are fairly consistent with one another, as they are in this case. That's why our model makes Mr. Romney a 77 percent favorite to win Michigan even though he has a relatively tenuous 4-point advantage there.
Still, if the forecast holds, the Michigan result would be the closest of any primary to date (Iowa and Maine were closer, but they were caucuses) - close enough that it is worth considering whether there are any factors that might not be picked up by the polling but which could work for or against either candidate.
In 2009, I developed a set of 15 clarifying questions for close elections that were meant to be applied in cases like these. The questions cover various hypotheses for why a candidate might overperform or underperform in polling or why it might not tell the whole story. Oftentimes, the questions balance out, but they do not always - in the New Jersey gubernatorial election in 2009, for instance, they tended to favor Chris Christie, which is why I said the odds were in his favor even though the polling showed a dead heat there.
Although the questions were phrased with the general election in mind, they can be easily adopted to a primary. Let's work through each question quickly. If most of them tend to favor Mr. Santorum, we might conclude that the race is more of a tossup. If they favor Mr. Romney instead, then he could be the favorite to beat the four-point spread that the model establishes.
A week or two ago, polls were finding that voters who were most certain or excited to vote in Michigan tended to favor Mr. Santorum, giving him a potential advantage especially in the case of low turnout. Now the surveys are more equivocal on that point. The Rasmussen Reports poll, for instance, showed a slightly larger lead for Mr. Romney (nine points) among those who said their choice was certain than it did overall.
Still, there has been enough overall evidence of the relative lack of enthusiasm for Mr. Romney throughout the nomination process to score this as a point in Mr. Santorum's favor.
Count this factor as a point in favor of Mr. Romney, who is widely regarded as having the better organization in the state. It should be noted that all the candidates' "ground games" are fairly weak by historical standards, and if Mr. Romney does not win Michigan, I think we'll need to ask whether this factor is quite all that it's cracked up to be. But having more boots on the ground can't hurt.
The incumbent rule is the notion that undecided voters tend to break toward the challenger in a close race. This was once regarded as a savvy piece of political wisdom, but the empirical evidence for it is lacking in recent years. 
More important, there isn't an incumbent in this race. Perhaps Mr. Romney is somewhat closer to being one, in that he is the more familiar face to Michiganders and won the state in 2008, but that's too tenuous to tally a point against him.
Most of the polls are no longer showing very many undecided voters. But in the survey that had the most, from Mitchell Research, they seemed more like the types of voters who would support Mr. Romney, as the undecideds were more likely to be female than male, and somewhat conservative rather than very conservative.
The rule also refers, however, to third-party candidates. Often (as in New Jersey in 2009), these candidates underperform in polling because voters conclude they are not viable and switch to one of the front-runners, not wanting to waste their vote.
There is an obvious analogy here in primaries, which is candidates who are well off the pace - in this case, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul. One of the more heartening numbers for Mr. Santorum comes from the Rasmussen Reports poll, which found that he would defeat Mr. Romney by two percentage points in a true two-way race. That might suggest that he could gain a percentage point or two if Mr. Gingrich's and Mr. Paul's supporters drift away from them.
Still, since Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Paul no longer have all that much support in Michigan, and since the demographics of the undecided vote seem to slightly favor Mr. Romney, we are calling this a wash. If we are seeing on Tuesday night that Mr. Gingrich is in the single-digits, however, Mr. Romney's advisers might have some reason to be nervous.
Although Mr. Romney generally had the stronger news cycles over the course of the last week, that should be priced into the model by now, since two of the polls were conducted on Sunday night and since the model also makes an effort to account for a candidate's momentum. So this category stands to consider more late-breaking developments that were too late to be accounted for by the polling. 
Mr. Romney did draw some negative headlines for his speech at Ford Field, which was inartfully staged and held before a mostly empty stadium. Still, the most recent polls postdate the Ford Field speech, so any impact should be accounted for.
Neither candidate, frankly, has done much to drive a message, with Mr. Romney's campaign (and his "Super PAC") running mostly negative ads, while Mr. Santorum has pivoted awkwardly between economic and social issues and competing critiques that he is too much of part of the Republican establishment and too conservative to be electable. No point awarded here.
This question, like the others, is phrased in the context of general elections, but there is an intuition here that can also be applied toward primaries. Is there evidence from other states - or from national polls - that one candidate has the momentum?
In this case, there is, enough to score a point for Mr. Romney. He has erased Mr. Santorum's lead in the Gallup national tracking poll and he has also gained ground in Arizona, where our model now projects a blowout victory for him. This data makes it less likely that the shift toward Mr. Romney in Michigan is some sort of statistical fluke.
Yes, Mr. Romney does, and so he scores another point. In the Public Policy Polling survey, Mr. Romney led by 33 points among those who have already cast early or absentee ballots. Although these voters represent only 17 percent of the projected turnout in the survey and although some of this is because Michigan's rules allow voters 60 and older to cast absentee ballots for any reason (a group with whom Mr. Romney performs strongly anyway), it's always nice to have a few votes in the bag.
This factor applies to cases were there are multiple races on the ballot and there could be coattails. However, the presidential primary is the only race on the ballot on Michigan on Tuesday, so it has no relevance here.
Many of the polls in Michigan are automated surveys that do not call cellphones. But there isn't much evidence on how this might bias the results against a candidate. The closest thing to an exception is probably Ron Paul, whose demographics are more cellphone-heavy, but he is not within striking distance in Michigan.
However, there is another group of voters that could be helpful to Mr. Santorum, which are Democrats who might cross over to vote for him in an effort to create turmoil in the Republican primary. Indeed, Michigan has a history of this type of tactical voting, which may have helped John McCain to a relatively clear victory there in 2000.
In theory, these voters should be captured in the polls like any others, but they may be screened out by likely voter models, who may regard them as dubious if they have not voted in past Republican primaries. I'm a little skeptical about how much of this will materialize, but it's enough to score a point for Mr. Santorum.
Yes - polls throughout the primaries and caucuses so far have underestimated Mr. Santorum's performance. Mr. Santorum scores a point here and it is perhaps the best reason to be optimistic about his chances.
With rare exception, Repubican candidates have drawn small-to-middling crowds throughout the nomination campaign, and Michigan seems to be no exception, with most reports describing audiences of perhaps 100 to 1,000 people. Estimates of crowd sizes at some Ron Paul events have been larger than that, but neither of the front-runners deserve a point here.
Mr. Romney has raised much more money than the other candidates in Michigan throughout the campaign - $1.6 million in itemized contributions, versus only about $50,000 for Mr. Santorum.
However, this category is meant to focus on fund-raising close to the election, and Mr. Romney's advantage was surprisingly tenuous in January. In that month, he raised $51,246 from 179 itemized donors in Michigan, according to his recent Federal Election Commission filing, versus $38,743 among 101 donors for Mr. Santorum. That's still a slight advantage, so we'll score a point for Mr. Romney, but the slowdown in fund-raising could be problematic for Mr. Romney in the longer term.
Mr. Santorum has run the more positive campaign and scores a point in this category. His "Super PAC" has run some preemptive and negative ads in the state, but they have been counterbalanced by positive spots - more than in Mr. Romney's case. 
Once again, this question is framed in terms of a general election, but can be applied to a primary by considering which candidate has more support from statewide officials. In this case, that is Mr. Romney, who scores a point because he was endorsed by Michigan's governor, Rick Synder, along with a series of other current and former elected officials. In the event of a disputed vote-count in Michigan - and remember, that has already occurred in two Republican states so far - they could weigh in favor of Mr. Romney.
If you've been keeping score, you'll find that we've counted five categories (No. 2, 7, 8, 13 and 15) in favor of Mr. Romney, and four (No. 1, 10, 11 and 14) in favor of Mr. Santorum. There was also a case for scoring point No. 3 and No. 4 in favor of Mr. Santorum, but we came down against doing so.
Overall, that is not much of an edge for either side - which leads me to conclude that we should trust the polls, which give an edge to Mr. Romney but also leave Mr. Santorum with plausible upset chances. If the result does not abide by the polls - say, Mr. Romney wins by 10 points, or Mr. Santorum wins by any margin - we can revisit these factors to consider which ones might have played the largest role in the unexpected result.

HEADLINE: Saving the Capitalist Goose

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Accounting rules and short-term perspectives discourage companies from embracing sustainability, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
 "Sustainable capitalism" is former Vice President Al Gore's new slogan, summarized in a manifesto written with the investment manager David Blood and elaborated in a new white paper. Echoing Aesop's classic fable, the authors urge efforts to protect the future flow of golden eggs by taking better care of the goose that lays them. 
Willingness to forgo current consumption in order to invest for future returns is, theoretically, a capitalist virtue. But many economists agree that current institutional arrangements induce "short-termism" (sometimes referred to as "managerial myopia") in corporate governance. 
The problem shows up even in such conventional measures of economic performance as investment and productivity. 
In a comprehensive overview published in Challenge magazine, the economists Christian Weller and Luke Reidenbach offer a number of reasons why distorted priorities contributed to lower productivity growth in the years leading up to the Great Recession and helped motivate passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

More detailed evidence of managerial bias is provided by a recent comparison of the investment behavior of otherwise similar public and private companies between 2001 and 2007 by the economists John Asker, Joan Farre-Mensa, and Alexander Ljungqvist, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
In public companies, ownership is dispersed among many shareholders, who find it easier to buy and sell shares than to influence management. As a result, managers are under pressure to generate short-term profits. In private companies, owners typically make longer-term commitments and have more influence over management. 
The comparison shows that private companies invested a much higher percentage of their assets (10 percent, compared with 4 percent among public companies) and were more responsive to changes in investment opportunities. 
Mr. Gore and Mr. Blood point to another form of short-termism that extends beyond company balance sheets. Their manifesto emphasizes the risks of environmental degradation and increased poverty and inequality. They outline five key steps that could be taken to encourage a longer view.
Three of these steps involve accounting reforms. One is quite simple: substitute annual earnings reports for conventional quarterly ones, requiring more patience from investors. Quarterly reports, long the standard in the United States, are less common in Europe.
Another, more challenging accounting reform would be to identify and incorporate risk from "stranded assets" - those whose value would drastically change if their unpriced effects were taken into account (as with a carbon tax that would assign a price to carbon emissions). 
A third mandate would go even further, requiring companies to integrate environmental, social and governance metrics into their decision-making processes. It's hard to imagine the process by which guidelines for such accounting could be agreed upon and enforced. But many self-described "socially responsible" investment funds have already moved in this direction. 
Mr. Gore and Mr. Blood founded an investment partnership named Generation that screens for long-term sustainability.
In the white paper, the authors point out that such changes would be likely to require securities regulators and stock exchanges to establish new rules. In 2011, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in South Africa instructed all its listed companies either to produce an integrated report or explain why they were not doing so. 
Beyond changes in accounting, the sustainable capitalism campaign calls for redesign of compensation plans to reward managers for long-term rather than short-term performance and "loyalty securities" that would offer a higher rate of return to investors willing to commit to a long period of ownership. 
Given the evidence that public companies tend to invest less than private ones, these measures might contribute to long-run profitability as well as long-run sustainability. A recent blog post in The Economist noted, "Even traditional unsustainable capitalists should give the manifesto a look."
As well they should. I'm not convinced that the recommendations that Mr. Gore and Mr. Blood offer go far enough to deliver sustainability. But they have done a good job of warning the business community that its goose may get cooked.

President Obama opted not to endorse the recommendations of a deficit commission he created, but later adopted many of the proposals in a modified form, Jackie Calmes reports. Mr. Obama's handling of the Bowles-Simpson plan illuminates his struggles with the deficit politics that have curbed his ambitions and forced him to confront the limits of his persuasive powers.

        
While Mitt Romney is now counting more than ever on superior organization and planning to pull him through a state-by-state battle for delegates, such an image can undercut a candidate as much as it benefits him, Ashley Parker writes. He continues to fight the perception that he, like the operation working to elect him, is a triumph of political engineering over passion and authenticity.

        
Illegal immigration is no longer the all-consuming issue it had been for so long in Arizona, Adam Nagourney reports. The economic problems - unemployment, home foreclosures - have contributed to the shift in attention, along with some Republicans fearing that the issue could alienate Latino voters.

        
Republican-led Legislatures are lagging in the creation of health insurance exchanges, a centerpiece of the 2010 health care law, until they know if President Obama will be able to enforce the new law or not, Robert Pear reports. While many states are waiting for a Supreme Court decision or even the November election results, they may run out of time for compliance, as the Obama administration will begin deciding on Jan. 1, 2013 whether each state is ready to run its own exchange or whether the federal government should do the job.

HEADLINE: Santorum Campaigns in Michigan's Upper Peninsula

BYLINE: KATHARINE Q. SEELYE


HIGHLIGHT: About 275 people came out on a snowy Sunday to see Rick Santorum, one of the few politicians to travel all the way up to Michigan's sparsely populated Upper Peninsula. 

 BODY:
MARQUETTE, Mich. -- About 275 people came out on a snowy Sunday to the Holiday Inn here to see Rick Santorum, one of the few politicians to travel all the way up to this town on Lake Superior in Michigan's sparsely populated Upper Peninsula.
"You can set this election on its ear," Mr. Santorum exhorted the friendly crowd as he urged them to "send a very clear and loud message from up here in the U.P., good conservative country."
Michigan votes Tuesday, and the next week is Super Tuesday, when voters in several states go to the polls. Mr. Santorum said of that important milestone in the primary calendar: "You can tee it up, right here in Michigan." Few states get the opportunity to have as dramatic effect on an election as Michigan has now, he said, leaving unsaid that the state is home to Mitt Romney, his chief rival for the Republican presidential nomination. A loss for Mr. Romney in Michigan could be a startling setback for his candidacy.
Mr. Santorum does not usually tailor his introductory remarks to his audiences, but because the U.P. is so neglected, he did so on Sunday. He talked about going to a local eatery, Lawry's Pasty Shop, for a "filling" breakfast. A pasty (pronounced PASS-tee) is like a chicken pot pie and is a U.P. specialty.
Mr. Santorum said he put Heinz ketchup on his pasty in an effort to blend his home culture of Pittsburgh with the local culture here. 
He was chattier and seemed more relaxed than he has at recent events. He told the audience that he had arranged for his logo to appear on top of a car at the Daytona 500 and, with a comic's timing, he drew out his description of advice he said he gave the driver.
"When you're starting way in the back of the pack, just hang back there for a while, let all the other cars in front of you" -- here he paused -- "wreck," he said to laughter, "and then run hard in the last few laps and win the race." It was lost on no one that this reflected the course of Mr. Santorum's campaign.
He spent the first part of his hour at the microphone discussing threats overseas and what he said were President Obama's inadequacies.
"We have a president who is uniquely weak in the face of evil," he said. "This president appeases," he added. "We are much less influential, powerful and I would argue we are a much less safe country under the last four years of this president."
He then delved into his main message, about what he calls economic freedom. He said that President Obama had denied Americans their freedom with laws like his health care plan, saying repeatedly and derisively that the president believes "he knows better than you."
His fury at the Obama health care plan, he said, is the reason he got into the presidential race. He vowed to repeal the health care law, saying it represented the government's failure to trust its own citizens. 
Mr. Santorum took several questions, the first of which was whether he supported the minimum wage. He noted that he had voted both for it and against it, depending on how many people were making the minimum wage at the time. "There should be a threshold level where people have some floor of protection," he said.
One man complained about Mr. Santorum's opposition to Mr. Obama's health care plan, which requires everyone to have health insurance. The man said his mother had not been able to get prenatal care until she was seven months into one of her pregnancies. "Is this the kind of freedom you want to give us?" the man asked. "This is what happens when poor people don't have health care."
Mr. Santorum said that under his plan, lower-income people could receive credit from the government to help them buy health insurance. "Government doesn't provide your home, your food, your car," he said, "you can do that yourself."
Another man said that he and his fiancee were "heavily Roman Catholic" and do not believe in what he called "the contraception law," a reference to Mr. Obama's directive that insurance companies provide coverage for contraception for employees of religious institutions even if those institutions oppose contraception on moral grounds.
Mr. Santorum said the issue was not one of contraception but of religious freedom. "This is about government flexing its muscle, it's about politics, it's about government forcing its will" on religious organizations, he said. "It may be the Catholic church today, it may be you tomorrow, or it may be your neighbor tomorrow," he said. "But one of these days, it's going to be you that they come after."
Interviews with many in the crowd afterward found virtually everyone supporting Mr. Santorum. 
Mini Newman, 53, an artist and musician who has home-schooled her children -- as has Mr. Santorum -- said her main reason for supporting him was his opposition to abortion rights.
Douglas Morton, 65, a retired executive at a community mental health center, said he had been wavering because he was worried that Mr. Santorum could not get elected. Even after Mr. Santorum won other states, he still had doubts, he said, but now that Mr. Santorum had taken the trouble to come up here and ask for his vote, he would give it to him.
"We're very impressed when people come up to see us," Mr. Morton said. "We're off the beaten path. So that played into my decision. And I suspect I'm not the only one."

HEADLINE: Political Geography: Michigan

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: A look at who is likely to vote in Michigan's Republican primary and where those voters live. 

 BODY:
After a long hiatus, our "Political Geography" feature is back for the Wolverine State. The goal, as always, is simply to give you a sense of who is likely to vote in Michigan's Republican primary and where those voters live.
FiveThirtyEight reached out to a couple of local experts to learn the lay of the land, including John Truscott, the president of the strategic communications firm Truscott-Rossman, who served as communications director and press secretary to former Gov. John Engler, and Jill Alper, a Democratic strategist who works at the public affairs firm Dewey Square Group.
The Detroit Area
Thirty-five percent of voters in Michigan's 2008 Republican primary came from the Detroit area: Wayne County, home to Detroit, and Macomb and Oakland Counties to the north of the city.
The continuing exodus from Detroit has swelled the populations of both Oakland and Macomb. Oakland County is well-off and white collar. Its Republican voters are fiscally focused and more moderate on social issues.
If Mitt Romney wins Michigan, Oakland County may be his foundation; he won 47 percent of the vote in there in 2008. The Romney name is well-known in the area. His brother Scott Romney, a prominent lawyer, lives in Birmingham.
Macomb County has somewhat lower income levels and a heavier concentration in manufacturing jobs. Although Mr. Romney won 45 percent of the vote there in 2008, the area's blue-collar demographic may provide fertile territory for Rick Santorum, and how he fares in Macomb will be a good indicator for his statewide prospects.
Indeed, Macomb and Oakland are classic swing counties in both primaries and general elections; Macomb was the county that gave rise to the term "Reagan Democrats." The winner in Oakland and Macomb prevailed statewide in the 2010 Republican primary for governor (Rick Snyder), and the 2008 Republican primary for president (Mr. Romney). In the 2010 general election, Mr. Snyder beat Virg Bernero, a Democrat, in Macomb and Oakland and was elected governor. In 2008, President Obama won these two counties with 55 percent and also won the state.
Wayne County, dominated by Detroit, is mostly Democratic, but there are Republican areas to the north and west of the city. The voters in these Republican pockets are similar to their party brethren in Oakland County. To the south of Detroit is another area of Republican support. The voters there resemble residents in Macomb more than Oakland. In general, the Republican votes in Wayne County will come from suburban communities.
The Southwest
Anchored by Michigan's second largest city, Grand Rapids, the southwest of the state is dotted with midsize industrial cities, as well as a few rural farming communities.
The southwest has historically been the most Republican part of Michigan, and is more socially conservative than the rest of the state. Grand Rapids, in Kent County, has a significant population of conservative Christians. Many people in this region have Dutch ancestry, and the Reformed Church in America -- an offshoot of the Dutch Reformed Church, which takes a conservative stance on abortion -- is prominent there.
Mr. Santorum probably needs to run up a sizable margin in the southwest to win the state. Mr. Romney won the region in 2008, but barely, beating Senator John McCain by just one percentage point. It was also Mike Huckabee's best part of the state.
The University Belt
Home to Michigan State University in East Lansing and the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, this could be Ron Paul's strongest area because of support from college students. There are certainly quite a few of them: Michigan State University and the University of Michigan have roughly 90,000 students combined, and the region is well educated and socially moderate.
The region also includes the state capital, Lansing. Between the state government and the large number of university professors, it is more dependent on public-sector jobs and has weathered Michigan's deep recession somewhat better than other portions of the state.
Still, the area includes its share of manufacturing towns and has its ties to the automotive industry. Slightly Democratic-leaning in general elections, the university belt is probably somewhat favorable territory for Mr. Romney. But it could also be a source of a few Democratic votes for Mr. Santorum, some of whom may be voting tactically in an effort to prolong the Republican nomination process.
North Central/Upper Peninsula
Rural and thinly populated, the north central region of Michigan's Lower Peninsula has historically voted Republican. The Upper Peninsula, however, has traditionally voted Democratic, somewhat like the far northern reaches of Minnesota and Wisconsin. The congressman who represented the region, Bart Stupak, a Democrat, retired before the 2010 election and was replaced by a Republican.
In the 2008 Republican primary, this area was extremely competitive. Mr. Romney barely edged out Mr. McCain, beating him by just one percentage point, 35 percent to 34 percent. The region could prove to be a wild card again this year. Union membership is especially high in northern Michigan, with many retired United Auto Workers members. But voters are also fairly conservative on social issues, particularly abortion.
The charts below detail county-level results from Michigan's 2008 Republican primary. Keep in mind, however, that we have seen some shifts in these patterns this year, since Mr. Romney was running to the right of Mr. McCain in 2008 but is generally seen as to the left of Mr. Santorum this year.

HEADLINE: Hoyer Pledges New Push on Deficit

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The House's No. 2. Democrat says talks will start soon, despite the conventional wisdom that a deal can't be reached until after the election. 

 BODY:
The House's second-ranking Democrat on Monday said that a bipartisan group of lawmakers from both sides of the Capitol was preparing to begin yet another effort to reach a "grand bargain" on deficit reduction - and that the fruits of negotiations could emerge within weeks.
Speaking to the centrist group Third Way, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip, sought to bury the widely held belief that any deal on taxes and deficits would have to wait until after the November election.
"Contrary to what some believe, we cannot afford to set this work aside," Mr. Hoyer said, according to the prepared text of his speech. "I'm here to give urgency to the pursuit now of an agreement designed to achieve fiscal sustainability over the long term,"
Congressional aides confirmed that the so-called Gang of Six in the Senate - now up to eight - has reconvened and is trying to move a bipartisan deficit reduction plan from a broad framework to detailed legislative language. Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader, has told the group he will not move forward until he sees real language and real momentum.
But Mr. Hoyer's promises will meet a skeptical Washington after so many failed efforts, including President Obama's deficit reduction commission, headed by Erskine B. Bowles and Alan K. Simpson; direct talks between the president and Speaker John A. Boehner; separate negotiations between Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the House majority leader, Eric Cantor; and finally the so-called "supercommittee" formed in the wake of last year's near-default on the federal debt.
An aide involved in the talks said external events could thrust the issue back into the spotlight well ahead of the November election.
A flare-up of the debt crisis in Europe or a resolution of that crisis could turn bond traders' attention to the United States deficit. The federal government could approach the statutory limit on borrowing sooner than expected. Pressure could grow to stop more than $1 trillion in automatic, across-the-board cuts to defense and non-defense programs, known as "sequester," or to extend President George W. Bush's tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 on Jan. 1. Or the White House could shift its attention back to deal-making ahead of Election Day.
"The conventional wisdom in Washington is that our window for reaching a solution is after the election, during a lame-duck session," Mr. Hoyer said. "By then, we'll know the shape of the 113th Congress, feel the pressure of the looming sequester, and once again confront the expiration of the '01 and '03 tax cuts. That's where people - including many in this room - see a leverage point for making progress. But the action necessary to reaching a solution requires bipartisan support and a sharing of responsibility for the tough decisions that must be made."
Mr. Hoyer said quiet work on a deal was ongoing and a legislative package should be ready before the House Republicans take up their own budget blueprint at the end of March.

HEADLINE: Santorum Draws the Faithful at Michigan Rally

BYLINE: KATHARINE Q. SEELYE


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Santorum tells Michigan residents they could alter the path of the Republican contest. 

 BODY:
LANSING -- At an energetic rally here, Rick Santorum said Monday afternoon that the Michigan primary on Tuesday could mark a turning point in the Republican presidential primary contest, assuming he wins.
"Tomorrow's a big day," he told about 300 people crowded into a hotel ballroom and an overflow room. "This could be a game-changing day," he said, referring to the chance to deliver an embarrassing blow to Mitt Romney, his chief rival, in the state where Mr. Romney grew up.
"You have the chance to be the inflection point in this race," Mr. Santorum declared, urging voters to "not pay attention to those who say: 'Oh,
we can't really elect someone who's too conservative. We need to appeal to moderate voters.' "
The supportive crowd groaned and said, "No, no."
Many in the crowd said they had been alerted to the event through their home-school networks or their churches. Mr. Santorum was introduced by two pastors, and there were refrains of "amen" during his speech.
He gave something of a stem-winder, hitting his usual points but with more vigor and less discussion of the economy than in his address in the morning to a Chamber of Commerce audience in Livonia.
The crowd here responded especially enthusiastically to his relentless criticisms of President Obama.
"He doesn't tell the truth," Mr. Santorum declared of the president. "He doesn't believe you are capable of gathering information, having that public discussion about how we're going to solve problems in America, having a discussion about Social Security and Medicare. No, those programs aren't to be solved, they're to be used as hammers for political gain," he said, clenching his teeth. "Never really talk about fixing anything, just talk about how the other side wants to destroy those programs. That's his M.O. Use it as a whipping horse. Throwing Grandma off a cliff, or whatever other verbiage they want to use."
 He portrayed Mr. Obama as fixated on the environment to the detriment of the economy and said he disagreed with this approach. "I believe that we are put on this earth to be good stewards of this earth; we are not here to serve the earth but to be stewards of the earth," he said.
 He also blamed high gas prices for the economic downturn in 2008, when George W. Bush was president.
 "We went into a recession in 2008 because of gasoline prices," he said. "The bubble burst in housing because people couldn't pay their mortgages because of $4 a gallon gasoline." 
 He was asked later by reporters whether he misspoke, since economists do not attribute the downturn to gas prices. He said that "energy prices were spiking in the summer of 2008, and that was a factor." At another point he said: "I said that was a factor. I'm sorry, I'll make sure I'm much more specific when I talk."
Saul Anuzis, the former chairman of the state Republican Party, who lives here and is supporting Mr. Romney, attended the Santorum rally and was observing the crowd.
"He's appealing well to Michigan's Bible Belt," Mr. Anuzis said, "and that's partly because he gets to define himself. If he had walked in this room a month ago, a lot of people here wouldn't know who he was."
Mr. Anuzis, who is now a Republican national committeeman, said he recognized only a few people in the crowd because they were not party activists.
About a dozen children who are or have been home-schooled stood behind Mr. Santorum, who has home-schooled his children with his wife, Karen. Scattered throughout the audience were restless toddlers and gurgling babies.
Dolores Kehl, 80, and her daughter, Cheryl Oberholtzer, 56, both of whom described themselves as mothers, each drove more than an hour to attend the event. They both liked his stances on the issues, especially what they said was his family orientation and his outspokenness on what Ms. Oberholtzer called "protecting our First Amendment rights to worship."
Ms. Oberholtzer noted that Mr. Santorum had been criticized after "blowing the debate" in Arizona last week, when he said he had voted against his principles by supporting President George W. Bush's education policy. But, she said, she liked that he admitted to a mistake and said he seemed truthful. "He has more integrity than any of them," she said.
Mr. Anuzis, who said he found Mr. Santorum "sanctimonious and hypocritical," said he expected Mr. Romney to win on Tuesday. If he did not, he said, "it would be a hit" but not a fatal one because Mr. Romney has organizations in all 50 states.

HEADLINE: Speaking of Money, I Have a Lot of It

BYLINE: DAN SCHNUR


HIGHLIGHT: How damaging is Mitt Romney's awkwardness on the subject of his millions? 

 BODY:
Why is someone who is so good at making money so bad at talking about it?
Mitt Romney is not the first presidential candidate who's had trouble communicating with working-class voters: John Kerry famously enjoyed wind-surfing, and George Bush blamed a poor showing in a straw poll on the fact that many of his supporters were "at their daughter's coming out party." 
Veritable battalions of Kennedys and Roosevelts have dealt with the economic and cultural gaps between themselves and the voters over the years without much difficulty. Not so Barack Obama, whose attempt to commiserate with Iowa farmers in 2007 about crop prices by mentioning the cost of arugula at Whole Foods fell flat.
Romney's reference last week to the fact that his wife "drives a couple of Cadillacs, actually" is not grounds in itself for a voter to oppose his candidacy. Neither was the $10,000 bet he offered to Rick Perry during a debate in December or the time he told a group of the unemployed in Florida that he was "also unemployed."
But his penchant for awkward references to his own wealth has underscored the suspicion that many voters have about his ability to understand their economic problems. His opponents in both parties are gleefully highlighting these moments as a way to drive a wedge between Romney and the working class voters who have become an increasingly important part of the Republican Party base.
The current economic circumstances have undoubtedly exacerbated the problem for Romney. Had Obama initially sought the presidency during a primary season dominated by concerns about the domestic economy rather than war in Iraq, his explanation that small town voters "get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them" might have created an opportunity for Hillary Clinton or even the populist message of John Edwards.
But Obama's early opposition to the Iraq war gave him a political firewall that protected him throughout that primary campaign, while Romney has no such policy safe harbor to safeguard him from an intramural backlash.
Romney and Obama share a lack of natural affinity for this key group of swing voters, but it is Romney who needs to figure out some way of addressing this shortcoming if he wants to make it to the White House. It's Romney's misfortune that the voters' prioritization of economic issues, his own privileged upbringing and his lack of connection with his party's base on other core issues put him in a much more precarious position than candidate Obama ever reached.
By the time the 2008 general election rolled around, Obama had bolstered his outreach to these voters by recruiting the blue-collar avatar Joe Biden as his running mate. Should Romney win the Republican nomination this year, his advisers will almost certainly be tempted by the working-class credentials that a proletarian like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie or Florida Senator Marco Rubio would bring to the ticket. 
Of more immediate concern to Team Romney should be how their candidate can overcome his habit of economic tone-deafness before Rick Santorum steals away enough working-class and culturally conservative voters to throw the Republican primary into complete and utter turmoil.
The curious thing about Romney's verbal missteps is how limited they are to this very specific area of public policy. He is usually quite articulate when talking about foreign affairs and national security. Despite his complicated history on social and cultural matters like health care and abortion, his explanations are usually both coherent and comprehensible, even to those who oppose his positions. It's only when he begins talking about economic issues - his biographical strength - that he seems to get clumsy.
At this point, the Romney campaign has three options for dealing with this challenge. The first is for their candidate to stop saying peculiar things about financial matters. That's not going to happen. 
The second possibility would be for him to outline a series of proposals specifically targeted at the needs of working-class and poor Americans, not only to control the damage from his gaffes but also to underscore the conservative premise that a right-leaning agenda will create opportunities for those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder. But while that approach might help Romney in a broader philosophical conversation, it's unlikely to offer him much protection from the attacks and ridicule that his unforced errors will continue to bring him.
The question is why Romney hasn't embraced a third alternative - admitting the obvious and then explaining why he gets so tongue-tied when the conversation turns to money. Romney's upbringing and religious faith suggest a sense of obligation to the less fortunate and an unspoken understanding that it isn't appropriate to call attention to one's financial success.
It wouldn't be that hard for him to say something like:
Americans tend to gravitate toward candidates who are self-aware about their shortcomings. There's no guarantee that this type of approach would work for Romney. But white working-class voters represent a critical support base for the Republican Party - and increasing numbers of them are shopping for an alternative with whom they feel some semblance of an emotional connection.

HEADLINE: Water Views With a Hint Of Daring And Danger

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
EVERETT, Wash. -- As commutes go, the 59-minute train trip from this suburb into downtown Seattle can be pretty sweet. The tracks, first laid in 1873, swerve between the scenic eastern edge of Puget Sound and the steep bluffs increasingly covered with houses overlooking the water.
''And this time of year'' said Steve Pratt, a regular rider, ''the sunsets are great.'' 
When you can see the sun, that is.
As Mr. Pratt knows, this time of year it often rains -- a lot. And those pretty bluffs get wet -- really wet. Eventually, all that water changes the alluvial soil from relatively stable to completely sodden. It also transforms Mr. Pratt and his fellow passengers. Instead of train riders, they become bus riders.
Sometimes those bluffs become so saturated that they collapse, sending earth, trees and more down onto the tracks. That halts passenger train service and forces Mr. Pratt and his fellow passengers to transfer to express buses, to once again endure (and mostly shrug off) a topographical drama less spectacular but far more common than the potentially deadly earthquakes, avalanches and tsunamis that loom in anxious minds across the Pacific Northwest: mudslides.
''It's kind of a pain because you never know until you get over here whether it's going to go or not,'' Mr. Pratt said, standing near the train platform at the Everett station just after getting off the No. 510 bus on an evening when a slide had closed the tracks. ''But it's just part of living in Puget Sound.''
Mudslides are a threat from the Appalachians to the Andes, but a few parts of western Washington are particularly vulnerable. According to engineering studies, at one point or another over the past 80 years, pretty much the entire 20-mile stretch of track between Everett and Elliott Bay in Seattle has been covered by a mudslide -- or a landslide, as they are technically (but not colloquially) called. And train tracks are just one victim.
On Wednesday, the day a slide closed the tracks, another one took out a house beside the water in Stanwood, north of Everett. The owner was in Mexico at the time and no one was hurt. But the slide demonstrated another peril: sometimes houses most at risk are not on top of cliffs but at the bottom, steps from the water.
The sound is dotted with slivers of beachfront property where tiny private developments have sprung up over time, sometimes consisting of a single street with houses squeezed onto subdivided lots. Often there are only a few dozen feet of buildable land between the water and the massive slopes that descend to it. The land is precious, and sometimes precarious.
''More and more people live in places that would not have been regarded as good places to be before,'' said Tim Walsh, the chief hazard geologist for the Washington Department of Natural Resources.
This month, as a second consecutive La Nina winter brings heavy rain, the department is trying out an online mapping tool that, using data from the National Weather Service, tries to gauge the rainfall saturation of certain areas of western Washington. The software does not try to predict which hillsides will collapse -- that would be a far more complicated and expensive prospect, involving ground sensors and telemetry -- but the state hopes it can at least alert local emergency managers to potential risks.
Mr. Walsh said that mudslides rarely get as much attention as other disaster threats, but that ''excluding earthquakes in California, they probably are the largest or maybe second largest cause of natural disaster economic losses.''
He noted that damage from mudslides, including houses and buildings destroyed, rail lines and roadways damaged, is often categorized as flood damage by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, even when there is no traditional flood. That can mask the true costs of mudslides.
''For most people, it's not covered by insurance, and so when you get hit by one of these it's a 100 percent loss,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''They're potentially covered by flood insurance, but most people don't have flood insurance.''
A staple of mudslide stories is the near miss -- the homeowner who had just dashed off to the grocery store or was asleep in the bedroom when a slide struck the garage, or the train that had passed by just minutes earlier. (In Stanwood, residents said, an elderly man living in a house next to the one destroyed had died just a day or two before the slide.)
But landslides can also be lethal. In a tragedy often recalled locally, a family of four was killed in 1997 when a slide knocked their house on Bainbridge Island into the sound during the night.
''Every few decades, you have a big event,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''They're sufficiently infrequent that you forget.''
Except on the train. Last year, the Seattle-Everett route had nearly 100 slides, the most in at least 20 years, according to Gus Melonas, a spokesman for Burlington Northern Santa Fe, which owns the tracks. No one was hurt, and this year the number of slides has been relatively small, at least so far.
Mr. Melonas said that of the 32,000 miles of track the railroad maintains in 28 states and two Canadian provinces, the Seattle-Everett route experiences by far the most slides. Burlington Northern keeps cranes, bulldozers and other equipment staged near the tracks and has sensors along the tracks that are supposed to alert trains to slides. In the summer, ditches are dug and culverts are maintained to steer water away from hillsides, Mr. Melonas said.
The railroad closes tracks to passenger service for at least 48 hours after a slide, but it usually reopens to freight within a few hours. The line is crucial for commerce; the Boeing Company uses it to transport huge parts from the Port of Seattle to its factory in Everett. But given the increasingly crowded region and the growing demand for use of the tracks -- Sound Transit started the Everett commuter run in 2004 -- slides are a problem that can only be managed, not solved, Mr. Melonas and several others said.
''We all know that this is a rain forest area in which we live,'' he said. ''This just goes with the territory out here.''

HEADLINE: Pending Home Sales Rebound to a Level Near April 2010

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Contracts to buy previously owned homes in the United States neared a two-year high in January, an industry group said on Monday, further evidence the housing market was slowly turning the corner. 
The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in January, increased 2 percent to 97 points, the highest reading since April 2010. New contracts generally lead sales by a month or two.
Housing data ranging from home building to resales have been relatively upbeat, buttressing other signs of underlying economic strength that should help the recovery better withstand rising gasoline prices and a recession in the euro zone.
The housing market is becoming less of a drag on the economy, and home construction is expected to add to growth this year for the first time since 2005.
''Clearly we had better weather conditions in January that might have helped, but we have a situation where we are seeing a number of housing statistics turn,'' said Michael H. Strauss, chief economist at Commonfund in Wilton, Conn. ''It suggests housing is going to be an additive to G.D.P. this year.''
December's index of pending home sales was revised to show a much smaller 1.9 percent drop instead of the previously reported 3.5 percent decline. In January, new contracts were up 8 percent from their year-ago level.
The rise in last month's index suggested home resales would increase for a second consecutive month in February, and it also bodes well for the spring sales season.
''This spring we expect to see continued forward momentum in the housing market as excess inventory is absorbed and low-cost mortgage debt becomes more prevalent,'' said John Tashjian, principal at Centurion Real Estate Partners in New York. ''A strong spring housing season will be a critical indicator toward predicting growth in the housing market for 2012.''
The market has been hampered by an oversupply of unsold homes, but the number of both new and previously owned properties for sale has been whittled down in recent months.
However, with the foreclosure tide yet to recede and continuing to depress prices, recovery will take awhile. A report due on Tuesday is expected to show that prices in 20 metropolitan areas tracked by the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller fell by 0.5 percent in December after declining by 0.7 percent in November.

HEADLINE: Renuzit Goes After Market Share by the Hunk

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
A campaign for a new product in a competitive category is being liberally peppered with sex, but the intent is lighthearted rather than lascivious.
The Renuzit brand of air fresheners, sold by a division of the household-products giant Henkel, is being expanded with the addition of a line named Renuzit Fresh Accents. The campaign, scheduled to begin in earnest this week, avoids the approach common for the category of presenting homes transformed into gorgeous showplaces by a spritz or whiff of fragrance.
Rather, the campaign, by an agency in Philadelphia named Red Tettemer & Partners, is centered on other gorgeous images: buff young men who are either shirtless or have opened their shirts to reveal chiseled midsections.
The jest is that Renuzit Fresh Accents is as gorgeous as the models because it is, the print, online and outdoor ads declare, ''the first air freshener designed to look as great as it smells.'' 
The ads carry headlines like ''Look at this gorgeous air freshener next to this gorgeous man'' and ''Now that is gorgeous and the man is not so bad either.''
A section of the Renuzit Web site devoted to Renuzit Fresh Accents can be found at renuzit.com/hellogorgeous. (Coincidentally, ads in a campaign for new Tide Pods, which plays off variations on ''pop,'' calls the tablets a ''Pop of hello gorgeous.'')
And the new Renuzit line is being sold ''at a gorgeous price,'' the ads proclaim -- that is, a value price that starts at $1.99 apiece. (The product is composed of a decorative holder and a gel that is billed as lasting 30 days.)
The campaign for Renuzit Fresh Accents, with a budget estimated at $5 million, is certainly not the first to use sex as a sales tactic. After all, Lillian Russell appeared in ads for Coca-Cola at the turn of the last century.
The campaign is, however, an example of a more recent trend, in which marketers take a tack that may be described as ''turnabout is fair play'': After decades of objectifying women to peddle products, Madison Avenue is now doing the same with men.
The trend takes two paths, straightforward and tongue-in-cheek. The serious side was on display during Super Bowl XLVI on Feb. 5, when H&M ran a commercial for a new line of bodywear bearing the David Beckham name that showed Mr. Beckham baring about as much of a body as can be bared in prime time on American broadcast television.
The silly side is typified by the long-running campaign for I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, which once featured Fabio, as well as commercials for brands like Old Spice. Another example of a campaign playfully serving up beefcake is a new one from the Clorox Company, for a new type of Liquid-Plumr called Liquid-Plumr Double Impact. Two hunky actors portray plumbers in a commercial filled with double entendres like ''a long snake to grab deep clogs.'' The actors also appear on the Liquid-Plumr Facebook fan page, at facebook.com/LiquidPlumr, where one poses partly bare-chested, displaying a muscular abdomen and the waistband of his briefs. The actors invite visitors to ''give us a call'' at 1-855-HOT-PLMR or send ''a steamy Plumr-Gram'' to Facebook friends.
The commercial for Liquid-Plumr Double Impact has received a mixed reception on social media, as typified by a blogger who describes it as ''cheeky'' but also believes it ''crosses'' the line of selling sex. Executives who sell Renuzit and work at Red Tettemer say they do not expect anyone to take the sex in their campaign seriously or to take offense at the ads.
Rather, they say, the hotties in the ads are supposed to represent the attractiveness of the decorative holders.
The goal is to offer the buyers of air fresheners, who are primarily women ages 25 to 54, an ''attractive'' product that ''fits into the home, something she wants right out there on the living room table'' rather than hidden on a top shelf, says Eric Schwartz, general manager for laundry and home care at the Henkel North America unit of Henkel in Scottsdale, Ariz.
''If there's one thing that gets the attention of the magazine reader, the online reader, in the cluttered, mundane world of air care, it's attractiveness,'' he adds. ''It's core to what consumers want to buy and use in the home.''
The campaign serves up ''the concept of attractiveness in a new way that would be memorable,'' Mr. Schwartz says, ''and potentially worth sharing in today's world of social media.''
The goal is ''to make a dollar's worth of spending'' on the campaign ''look like $10,'' he adds, as consumers ''find it humorous enough to pass on to friends and family.''
On Facebook, the campaign is in the spotlight on the Renuzit fan page, at facebook.com/Renuzit, and there is also a separate page under the rubric Gorgeous Man, where visitors are already posting comments both nice (''I'll take two!'') and naughty (''I'd like one in a size 'XL,' please'').
In another social media aspect of the campaign, so-called mom bloggers are being sent samples of the product and the ads and encouraged to write about them.
Mr. Schwartz is confident the ads will not be judged as exploiting sex because ''we're tying the advertising message to what we're trying to get across about the product,'' he says.
''I think the consumer is pretty savvy to marketing techniques,'' Mr. Schwartz says. ''They see the link between the attractiveness of the product and the advertising idea.''
Steve O'Connell, partner and executive creative director at Red Tettemer & Partners, echoes his client.
''Our effort was to keep it classy,'' says Mr. O'Connell, whose agency also creates campaigns for the Dial for Men product line sold by Henkel North America.
''We don't think it crosses the line,'' he adds. ''There's no sexual innuendo, there are no double entendres.''
As for the tone of the Renuzit Fresh Accents campaign, ''we don't want to take ourselves too seriously,'' Mr. O'Connell says.
''We want to have some fun with it,'' he adds, so the ads are presented ''with a wink,'' with an eye toward ''some shareability and talk value.''
If the ads were to say, '''Hey, this is a gorgeous air freshener,''' that would be ''boring,'' Mr. O'Connell says. ''Bring in a gorgeous man.''
''We didn't set out to objectify men,'' he adds, ''but you always see gorgeous women'' in ads because those responsible for creative tasks at agencies will say, '''There's a hot woman, so guys will pay attention.'''
''I'm an equal opportunity objectifier,'' Mr. O'Connell says, laughing.
Although the price of the product clearly plays a role in the campaign, the idea was ''not to lead with the price, but to lead with the attractiveness,'' Mr. O'Connell says, because ''the big part of the difference was its esthetics.''
The agency initially sought the models for the campaign in Philadelphia, he adds, but eventually cast the right kind of male pulchritude in New York.
''The fun tidbit we found on set,'' Mr. O'Connell says, is that one of the models was ''the guy in Beyonce's 'Irreplaceable' video.'' (His name is Bobby Roache.)
Renuzit Fresh Accents is a type of air freshener known, according to Mr. Schwartz, as ''nonelectric continuous action products,'' which cost less than plug-in or battery-operated air care items but more than a venerable, lower-tech Renuzit line, Renuzit Adjustables, which is often priced at 99 cents apiece.
Bringing out the new line is ''not just focused on the economic situation,'' Mr. Schwartz says, but clearly these days consumers are making choices ''between needs and wants.''
The nonelectric air fresheners are ''the one bright spot in an otherwise declining category,'' he adds.
The other marketers that sell air fresheners include powerhouses like SC Johnson & Son (Glade), Procter & Gamble (Febreze) and Reckitt Benckiser (Air Wick).
Reckitt Benckiser estimates the air freshener market in the United States at $2 billion annually; Henkel North America estimates it at $1.4 billion.
Reckitt Benckiser found success last year with a new product called Air Wick Flip & Fresh, a scented oil that is billed to last up to 45 days and costs around $2.99 for a single package and $4.99 for a twin package.
Red Tettemer created the Renuzit Fresh Accents campaign, which carries the theme ''Refresh. Renew. Renuzit,'' after being connected to the Renuzit brand executives by the Dial for Men brand executives, Mr. O'Connell says. Red Tettemer was awarded the Dial for Men account last March.
Henkel North America did not have an agency of record for Renuzit until recently, when Pereira & O'Dell in San Francisco was named to create campaigns for home care and laundry care products that, in addition to Renuzit, include Purex and Soft Scrub.
Red Tettemer ''has done great work for the company,'' Mr. Schwartz says, ''and will continue to work for the company.''
Henkel North America has been busily bringing out new products in several categories, among them Dial for Men Speed Foam Body Wash, Purex Complete 3-in-1 laundry sheets, Purex Ultra Packs tablets and a fabric softener, Purex Complete Crystals Softener.

HEADLINE: Decisive Vote Looms, Finally, For Whole Foods in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS

 BODY:
New varieties of hybrid tomatoes have been created in the time it has taken for one supermarket to rise in Brooklyn.
Eight years ago, Whole Foods Market bought a 4.2-acre site on the corner of Third Street and Third Avenue, steps from the infamous Gowanus Canal. Since then, the chain has had a ribbon-cutting and removed the toxic waste on the ground to the state's satisfaction -- but still there is no store. Whole Foods adjusted its plans because of the economy and community concerns about parking and traffic.
Twice in the past year it has fulfilled the city's requests for more analysis, and it has secured community board approval, even as a small but vocal opposition group says the project will hasten the end of affordability and enterprise in the industrial neighborhood. 
In the shadow of a Superfund site and between two neighborhoods that would seem to cry out for all things organic, the area remains underdeveloped; and Whole Foods has opened four other stores in Manhattan.
That could finally change on Tuesday, when a city panel is scheduled to vote on whether to approve a special permit for Whole Foods' proposed 52,000-square-foot, two-story store, which is more than five times bigger than the zoning regulations currently allow. Several people who have attended the public hearings and have been closely following the discussions said it appeared that the panel, the Board of Standards and Appeals, was set to approve the zoning variance.
While local shoppers and real estate developers cheer the potential of such a bountiful store, opponents attack it as a flawed plan from a national corporation that precluded other possibilities.
''There are other ways to develop a gigantic property, other than developing a single style of suburban supermarket,'' said Jennifer Gardner, a graduate student of urban planning and a researcher at the Gowanus Institute, a group formed by developers, planners and environmental professionals after the canal's federal Superfund designation in 2010.
But others see the store as a stimulus to the local economy.
''It's a responsible development,'' said Bill Appel, the executive director of the Gowanus Canal Community Development Corporation. He said the area along the canal, with its concrete and recycling plants, was a virtual wasteland between Park Slope and Carroll Gardens. ''You're waiting for a linchpin to unite these two vibrant areas,'' Mr. Appel said.
Lesley May, 41, shopping in Carroll Gardens recently with her two small children, said she usually drove to the Fairway market in Red Hook but would add Whole Foods to her weekly routine.
Anne McBrearty, in her 60s, who has lived in Park Slope since 1971, also supported the store. ''It will do nice things for Third Avenue,'' she said.
After all of its time and financial investments, Whole Foods is more than ready to proceed to the building phase. ''There seems to be this vision that we're a big-box store and not building and designing the store to be a part of the community,'' said Michael Sinatra, a regional spokesman for Whole Foods. ''We want to be a local community center.''
The six Whole Foods stores in New York City already sell local products, Mr. Sinatra said, including from Brooklyn companies like Sixpoint Ales, Brooklyn Brine and Salvatore Bklyn, a maker of ricotta. The new store would also produce 350 jobs, he said, 262 of them full-time. Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president, has supported the project, emphasizing its potential for job creation.
Original plans called for a parking deck and for the building to be partially underground, Mr. Sinatra said, but the current plan calls for a 248-space surface lot. The store will sell fruits and vegetables grown in a 20,000-square-foot rooftop greenhouse, and will have a charging station for electric cars. Whole Foods does not own the landmark Coignet Building on the corner but will repair its exterior, the company said. But members of the Gowanus Institute argue that a complex for small businesses and job training would better stimulate the local economy than one upscale store -- suggesting the advice to teach a man to fish instead of giving him a piece of grilled salmon from the prepared foods section.
The institute has proposed an alternative plan emphasizing these elements: a complex comprising a 10,000-square-foot Whole Foods store that would sell only local products, a building for food production and culinary arts training, and a building for green and creative industries. This approach could produce as many as 950 jobs, the institute said.
Other Gowanus workers fear that small businesses could be priced out of the neighborhood if, as expected, the store caused real estate values to soar.
At the Old American Can Factory across the street from the site, technology design companies share resources with neon-light manufacturers and musicians, forming a community of nearly 300 in a converted warehouse that seems to hum with creativity. Many there worry that the Whole Foods could lead to the rezoning of nearby properties.
''I do think it's a slippery slope,'' said Martin Bisi, a music producer who has operated a recording studio in the building since 1979, and has worked on albums by independent bands like Sonic Youth. ''My issue with this is what happens five years down the road, maybe even a decade. There's a lot of paranoia of people around here because we've seen in other parts of the city the process of what happens.''
Craig Hammerman, the district manager for the local community board, cautioned that any company wishing to build larger than the zoning regulations would be subject to the same rigorous review and variance approval as Whole Foods.
Bradford Reed, a musician in the warehouse who records music for television shows, said he was resigned to change.
''It would take a lot more than Whole Foods to outrage me,'' Mr. Reed said. ''I am saddened because it would be just more sterilization of this neighborhood.''
From a window of the studio he has kept for 23 years, he sees the former Jewish Press building, now a storage business painted a garish orange and navy.
As for the empty lot awaiting Whole Foods, Mr. Reed shrugged. ''That,'' he said, ''should be a park.''

HEADLINE: In Japan, Bankruptcy For a Builder Of PC Chips

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Elpida Memory, the world's third-largest maker of PC memory chips, filed for bankruptcy Monday with $5.6 billion in debt, crippled by competition, a faltering global economy and a shift from traditional PCs to smartphones and tablet computers. 
The manufacturer, which is based in Tokyo and makes memory chips for laptop and desktop computers, filed for protection from creditors after potential partners failed to make rescue bids, the company said.
Elpida's bankruptcy filing is the biggest ever by a Japan-based manufacturer and could represent the end of an era for a nation that once dominated the market for dynamic random-access memory chips, often known as DRAM chips.
Elpida will now undergo a court-led reorganization. It will be difficult, however, for Elpida to claw back into a market that will effectively be controlled by Samsung Electronics and Hynix, two South Korean companies that are the biggest makers of the chips. The two companies' grip on the global market could soon mean a rebound in chip prices, and higher price tags for consumers.
DRAM chips were invented in the 1960s in the United States, but Japanese companies priced American chip makers out of the market with cheaper and higher-quality technology.
But since then, Japan-based manufacturers have struggled to keep up with rising competition from South Korean rivals, which have better adapted to changes in technology -- including a shift by consumers toward smartphones and tablets, which use far fewer chips than laptops. Apple's iPad tablet computer, for example, primarily uses flash memory instead of DRAM.
Two Japan-based manufacturers, NEC and Hitachi, merged their memory businesses to form Elpida in 1999. Another Japanese maker, Fujitsu, abandoned the DRAM business the same year, and Toshiba followed suit in 2001.
Still, a persistent global glut in the chips has lowered prices.
Yukio Sakamoto, Elpida's president and chief executive, complained last year that the ''price of one DRAM now hardly buys you one rice ball.''
According to the market research firm iSuppli, Elpida ranked third in the global DRAM market with a 12 percent share in the three months to September, far behind Samsung Electronics, with 45 percent, and Hynix, with 22 percent.
Mr. Sakamoto said the company had been pushed into bankruptcy when offers from potential partners fell through. He declined to name potential deals or partners, however.
Elpida's bankruptcy filing is the biggest ever by a Japanese manufacturer, according to Shoko Research, a credit research company.

HEADLINE: A Growing French Flair Imbues the Thriving Business of Asia

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Gregory Joinau-Baronnet arrived in Hong Kong about a year ago with little more than a couple of suitcases and a desire to make a living in the wine business.
In France, Mr. Joinau-Baronnet had been a real estate agent specialized in selling wine-related property like vineyards. But business ground to a halt as the global financial crisis took hold in 2008. By late 2010, Mr. Joinau-Baronnet had had enough.
In January last year, he got on a plane to a place he knew was booming: Hong Kong, which is now attracting immigrants from France faster than its does from the United States, Britain or Germany. 
''I needed to move,'' said Mr. Joinau-Baronnet, 31, who has set up Jetson Trading, a small business that sells high-end wines and mineral water from his native Bordeaux. Guillaume Fortin, another Frenchman who arrived last year, joined him as sales manager.
As luxury companies storm Asia to soak up its rising wealth and sate a voracious appetite for their goods, a flood of French expats is arriving along with them, catering to the Asian nouveau riche with a savoir faire that is changing the face of the traditionally Anglo- Saxon communities in Hong Kong and Singapore. (Both cities are favored destinations for their functioning legal systems and access to hinterland markets in mainland China and Southeast Asia.)
The flow of Westerners who flock to Asia in search of jobs, business opportunities or a little Asian spice for the resume has picked up in the past few years, said James Carss, a senior executive at the recruitment firm Hudson in Hong Kong. And the French now lead that charge.
The French community in Hong Kong has grown more than 60 percent since 2006, and now numbers more than 10,000, according to the French consulate in the city. In Singapore, it has approximately doubled to more than 9,200 during the same period.
There are also sizeable French groupings in mainland China, Bangkok and southern India that also have expanded rapidly.
At least part of this growth has occurred because French companies associated with luxury, fine dining, wines, banking and other industries want French nationals on their local teams.
The sheer size of the United States, and Hong Kong's traditional ties to Britain, mean that there are still about 10 times as many Americans and many more Britons than French in the city, which is a special administrative region of China. But the number of American and British residents is rising only slowly: it has increased less than 10 percent since late 2006. The German community has stayed more or less flat.
The French influx can be heard, seen and felt all over the city. Walk through the bar districts or high-end shopping malls of Hong Kong, and it is likely you will encounter passers-by speaking French -- much more likely than it would have been two or three years ago. The French international school is bursting. French-run restaurants have multiplied.
Pastis, a small restaurant in the Central district of Hong Kong, has been a favored hangout for French expats since it opened in late 2009. At least two more French restaurants have opened in just the past few months. There is even a cafe with three dusty courts for boules, a lawn game popular in France, incongruously tucked away in a basement on Hong Kong island.
Hong Kong's appeal to shoppers from neighboring China, who benefit from the city's lower taxes on many goods, makes Hong Kong a key location for anyone catering to Chinese consumers. It has also helped ensure that the French community in Hong Kong is one of the largest in Asia.
''Asia in general, and China in particular, is booming,'' said Arnaud Barthelemy, the consul general of France in Hong Kong. French ''companies derive their growth from this region,'' he said, noting that many have subsidiaries or regional headquarters in the city.
Fanny Duguet is a case in point. She moved here with her husband and two young children last August, dispatched by her employer Richemont, the luxury goods giant, to help with the company's expansion in the region.
In a more independent vein, Edouard Malingue, a 38-year-old art dealer from Paris, decided Hong Kong offered better prospects than Europe or America for a new art gallery.
Mr. Malingue moved to Hong Kong in September 2009 and opened his gallery in the financial district a year later. Like other entrepreneurs, he was attracted by the lack of red tape and the relative ease of setting up a business.
Hong Kong is not without its challenges, however. Retailers have to work harder than in Europe or the United States to cultivate tastes and habits among customers who may not know the products or lifestyle they represent.
In Hong Kong, Mr. Malingue noted, ''there is not as much of a culture of visiting galleries as there is in Europe. It takes a lot more effort to grab peoples' attention.'' Despite the challenges, Mr. Malingue said, the gallery is now doing well.
Competition in many sectors, meanwhile, is fierce, as businesses rush to get in on the action. Salaries, if not augmented by increasingly rare benefits for expats, do not meet many Westerners' expectations. Both local and foreign employers generally prefer people with experience in Asia and language skills to match, said Mr. Carss, the recruitment executive.
In addition, commercial and residential rents are sky-high. Mr. Joinau-Baronnet, for example, is about to open a shop in the Tsim Sha Tsui neighborhood of Hong Kong. The rent on the small space he had to settle for is four times what a comparable space would cost in his native Bordeaux, and twice as much as in Paris, he said.
But he is undeterred. In addition to his new location in Hong Kong, he is considering a second store in Shenzhen or Guangzhou, just across the Chinese border, next year.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Pressure Grows on Fannie and Freddie to Reduce Principal on Some Loans

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
California's attorney general, Kamala D. Harris, has ratcheted up the pressure on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to allow debt reduction on their home loans by asking the mortgage finance giants to halt foreclosures in the state.
In a letter to Edward J. DeMarco, the regulator who controls Fannie and Freddie, Ms. Harris asked that foreclosures be suspended until his agency, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, completes a promised review of its policy forbidding debt reduction for delinquent homeowners who owe more than their home is worth.
Her letter, which was sent on Friday and disclosed on Monday, requests ''a thorough, transparent analysis of whether principal reduction is in the best interest of struggling homeowners as well as taxpayers.'' 
Mr. DeMarco has come under increasing pressure to allow debt forgiveness, also called principal reduction, since the announcement of a multibillion-dollar foreclosure abuse settlement that requires banks to write down mortgage debt for some eligible homeowners. Loans backed by Fannie and Freddie -- more than half of all outstanding mortgage loans -- are not eligible for relief under the settlement.
The two officials have been at odds on how to handle the mortgage crisis. Ms. Harris has suggested that Mr. DeMarco should resign because he was not doing enough to help the housing market recover. She has also sued Fannie and Freddie in an attempt to force them to answer questions about their foreclosure policies. About 80,000 Fannie and Freddie loans in California are in the process of foreclosure, according to an estimate by the attorney general's office.
Martha Coakley, the attorney general of Massachusetts, has also asked Mr. DeMarco to allow debt reduction, as have some housing analysts, who say that debt reduction is the surest way to prevent foreclosure.
Mr. DeMarco has resisted principal reduction, saying it would cost taxpayers too much.
Proponents of debt forgiveness note that roughly one out of five Americans owes more on a home than it is worth, and that negative equity totals almost $700 billion. Reducing some of that debt will save families' homes and save lenders money, they say, by reducing the number of foreclosures. In California, banks agreed to give $12 billion in debt reduction under the settlement, and the architects of the settlement hope that will pry open the spigot of debt reduction, which banks have been reluctant to do on a large scale.
''I know this effort will confirm what many economists have already concluded: principal reduction plans are the most helpful form of loss mitigation for homeowners and the most cost-effective for investors when compared to foreclosures,'' Ms. Harris wrote.
For his part, Mr. DeMarco has said that while debt forgiveness would save taxpayers money in the long run by preventing foreclosures, it would not save as much as another type of loan modification called forbearance. With forbearance, a portion of the debt is suspended until the end of the mortgage term or until the house is sold. The homeowner's payments are reduced but he does not regain an ownership stake in the home.
A recent letter to Mr. DeMarco from two Democratic members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform took issue with his reasoning. It said that using the Federal Housing Finance Agency's own analysis, principal reduction of Fannie Mae loans would save taxpayers more money than forbearance. It also questioned the assumptions underlying the agency's calculations.
A spokeswoman for the finance agency said it had sent a response to Ms. Harris's letter.
Mr. DeMarco has left the door open to allowing debt reduction, and recently the Treasury Department tripled its incentives to lenders to do principal reduction under its Home Affordable Modification Program, commonly referred to as HAMP, and offered them to Fannie and Freddie for the first time. The Federal Housing Finance Agency has said that it would review the new incentives.

HEADLINE: At Risk and Under Scrutiny

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
Who doesn't want to be in the top 1 percent of wage earners, political discomfort aside?
No one, though, is especially envious of another group of 1 percenters: the heaviest users of health care.
One percent of patients account for more than 25 percent of health care spending among the privately insured, according to a new study. Their medical bills average nearly $100,000 a year for multiple hospital stays, doctors' visits, trips to emergency rooms and prescription drugs.
And they are not always the end-of-lifers. They are people who suffer from chronic and increasingly common diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure. 
As the new federal health care law aims to expand care and control costs, the people in the medical 1 percent are getting more attention from the nation's health insurers.
''The huge opportunity is the at-risk people who are chronically ill,'' said Dr. Alan Muney, the chief medical officer for Cigna, a large health insurer. ''The problem in the health care system today is there is often too little too late or too much too often.''
Studies have already shown that Medicare spending is concentrated on a small group of individuals who are seriously ill. But an analysis by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, the research arm of IMS Health, a health information company in Danbury, Conn., provides a rare glimpse into the medical problems of people with private health insurance who are under 65. About three-quarters of them suffer from at least one chronic condition that could spiral out of control without proper care.
Health insurers are likely to have little choice other than to monitor these cases more closely, said Daniel Malloy, an executive at IMS Health. Under the federal health care law, which is expected to go into effect in 2014 if it is not struck down by the Supreme Court, insurers will no longer be able to deny coverage to anyone with a potentially expensive medical condition or put limits on how much they will pay in medical bills.
And avoiding these patients altogether will no longer be an option. Insurance companies will be required to enroll millions of new customers without the ability to turn them away or charge them higher premiums if they are sick. They will prosper only if they are able to coordinate care and prevent patients from reaching that top 1 percent, Mr. Malloy said. ''The insurance model is fundamentally changing,'' he said.
Many insurance executives say they are already developing programs to better address the needs of these patients. The insurers often work with employers that are self-insured to manage their workers' medical conditions, and companies are already demanding they do what they can to control costs.
''Once we've got patients, we're responsible,'' said Dr. Lonny Reisman, the chief medical officer for Aetna, another large insurer. ''We've always managed them as aggressively and effectively as we can.''
Insurers are becoming increasingly sophisticated in being able to identify those who are high spenders and those who are at risk of developing serious complications. ''It's important to know who they are and manage their conditions,'' said Dr. Pat Courneya, the medical director for the health plan offered by HealthPartners, a large health system based in Bloomington, Minn., which is a client of IMS. People with high medical bills often continue to be costly throughout the years, he said.
While diabetes, for example, typically costs about $12,000 a year to cover, a diabetic whose condition rages out of control can become one of the top spenders with expenses that average $102,000 a year, according to the IMS report. Uncontrolled, their diabetes may lead to a heart attack or stroke or they may lose their eyesight or have a limb amputated.
When Wendy Meath, a 59-year-old with diabetes, was hospitalized a year ago, she was identified by HealthPartners as someone who needed help to control her disease. She had been admitted for kidney stones, one of many possible complications of diabetes. Although she had insurance through her husband, she was unemployed.
Since leaving the hospital, where she was admitted for 12 days for a series of complications from the surgery to remove the stones, Ms. Meath has been in regular contact with one of HealthPartners' nurses, who serves as a case manager. The nurse calls at least once a month and checks in after she goes to the doctor for any developments. The health plan also assigned a social worker to help her with the cost of medications and other obstacles that were preventing her from taking better care of herself. ''It makes me feel like I'm not alone,'' Ms. Meath said.
''They're trying to prevent the big things from happening, which is great,'' she said.
The next challenge, say insurers, is to figure out how best to work with a person's doctor. Because many of these patients seem to be seeing many doctors and taking many medications, there may be no one who is accountable for the patients' overall health. ''You're going to see some gaps in care that led to this kind of progression,'' Mr. Malloy said.
Insurers say they are experimenting with different ways to pay doctors so they are more responsible for overseeing these patients. Cigna, for example, says it plans to pay doctors more to coordinate care or develop ways for the doctors to share in the savings generated when someone does not go to the hospital if the visit could have been avoided through better treatment.
But insurers are also still grappling with their understanding of human nature -- why some people simply don't take care of themselves or take their medicine or go to the doctor, even when it is clear that they should.
Aetna, for example, recently eliminated the co-payments in some of its health plans for certain medicines for people who have recently suffered a heart attack. In a recent study, however, many patients who got these medicines free were still not taking them.
''The reality is if we don't figure out how to get to the patients, we're not going to get where they need to be,'' Dr. Reisman said.

HEADLINE: A U.S. Boon In Low-Cost Borrowing

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- These are the best of times for the world's most ravenous borrower, the United States of America.
A combination of unusual and unsustainable forces has pushed the cost of borrowing as low as it has ever been, so low that many investors effectively are paying to lend money to the government.
Investors buying five-year federal debt are accepting such low interest rates that inflation is on pace to reduce the value of their investments by more than 1 percent each year. Yet demand for United States Treasuries remains much greater than the supply. 
The glut of cheap money has allowed the government to keep its annual deficits much smaller than it had expected, holding down the growth of the federal debt.
The Treasury Department, seeking to milk the moment, may start issuing debt with negative interest rates, making investors pay for the privilege of lending money to the government.
But a wide range of experts agrees that the bubble will eventually pop. The question, they say, is not if but when. There are signs that the era of low borrowing costs may be approaching its end, as the domestic economy shows signs of strength and Europe pulls back from economic immolation.
''We are in an unusual period right now in which net interest expense is temporarily depressed,'' William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech last week. ''This will not last.''
People have been predicting that rates will rise ever since the 2008 financial crisis sent investors piling into the safe haven of federal debt, driving down rates.
But what looked like a brief plunge has become a broad trough. The average rates that the government pays to investors in its debt have declined in each of the last five years, from 4.92 percent at the end of 2006 to 2.24 percent at the end of 2011. Rates have edged even lower so far this year. Adjusting for inflation, the government is borrowing at virtually zero cost.
As a result, while the size of the public debt more than doubled over the last five years, from less than $5 trillion to more than $10 trillion, the government's annual interest payments remained about the same.
In 2006, the bill was $226.6 billion. Last year, the bill was $227.1 billion. The numbers exclude debt held within the government, by the Social Security trust fund, and the cost of interest on those debts.
The danger, Mr. Dudley said last week, is that the current situation may lead some to underestimate the long-term cost of the debt when rates inevitably rise. The administration's recent budget projects that rates will increase gradually over the next decade, including about 1 percentage point this year. If the increase is just 1 percentage point larger this year, the deficit will grow by $13 billion. If the same higher trajectory holds over 10 years, the additional interest payments would approach $1 trillion.
The basic reason to expect higher rates is that investors usually demand compensation as a borrower's debts increase. And the government projects that its debt will grow rapidly in coming years.
The ratings agency Standard & Poor's last year removed some categories of United States debt from its list of the world's least risky investments, citing its concerns about the ability of the government to contain the growth through cutbacks in planned spending or increases in federal revenue.
So far, however, investors have grown only more clamorous for Treasuries.
The demand reflects the weakness of the domestic economy, and the Federal Reserve's determined campaign to drive down the cost of borrowing by purchasing more than $1.6 trillion in Treasury securities.
One less obvious benefit is that about 10 percent of federal interest payments are now collected by the central bank, which returns almost all of the money to Treasury because it is required by law to remit its profits.
The United States also has benefited from concerns about the health of European governments. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the benefits of investors fleeing Europe to buy Treasuries have roughly offset any other damage to the American economy from the struggles of the euro zone.
''There's a good argument that the net impact on the U.S. economy is zero, a little more or less,'' the I.M.F.'s chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, said in a recent interview.
All of this has prompted a flight to safety so determined that investors are lining up to accept the near certainty of small losses on Treasuries to avoid the possibility of larger losses on stocks, corporate bonds or the debt of other countries.
This month, when the government auctioned off one-year debt, Treasury agreed to pay 14 cents for every $100 that it borrowed, or 0.14 percent. Last week at the most recent auction of five-year debt, it agreed to pay 88 cents a year for every $100 that it borrowed. At a 2 percent inflation rate, investors would need to be paid $2 for every $100 they lent just to keep pace.
Treasury is now reviewing whether to let prospective lenders offer negative interest rates, meaning that they would pay the government rather than vice versa. It is expected to make a decision by May.
Some economists say they believe rates will remain low for years. David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, forecasts little change through 2013.
''While there have been some bright spots in the data, the economy probably won't be strong enough to justify rate increases,'' Mr. Greenlaw said.
Other economists expect that rates will begin to rise later this year, as the domestic economy improves and fears about Europe abate.
John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York, expects rates on 10-year Treasuries to reach 3.75 percent this year, up from about 2 percent now, as investors awaken from what he described as ''extreme risk aversion.''
But he added that he didn't understand why rates had remained low for this long.
''I have to say that it's a bit of an enigma,'' Mr. Ryding said. ''It's a conundrum.''

HEADLINE: A Family on the Cusp of Hope and Homelessness

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
The spirit of Lena Younger walks the rotting tenement corridors of Katori Hall's ''Hurt Village,'' and she surely can't be cheered by what she sees. Not that Mama Younger, the matriarch from Lorraine Hansberry's ''Raisin in the Sun,'' is ever mentioned by name in this sprawling, energy-packed play about the last days of a Memphis housing project in the early 21st century.
Still, it's hard not to think of this production, which opened on Monday night at the new Pershing Square Signature Center, as a rousing, latter-day response to Hansberry's watershed drama of 1959, ''A Raisin in the Sun.'' Like that play, Ms. Hall's latest offering is centered on an African-American family, ruled by an elderly woman of will, preparing to leave a shabby, claustrophobic apartment for a newer, brighter home. And like the Younger family of ''Raisin,'' Ms. Hall's clan is going to encounter plenty of obstacles before it can make that move. 
But while Hansberry's play ended on a note of tempered optimism, Ms. Hall (the young author of ''The Mountaintop,'' seen on Broadway earlier this season) suggests that, for many African-Americans, that promise of social betterment has never been fulfilled. The quiet rage that seethed through much of ''Raisin'' has been succeeded by an angry, whooping cry that is equal parts defiance and defeat. It's hardly surprising when one of the characters in ''Hurt Village'' cautions: ''It ain't good to want too much. End up disappointed.''
Where there's vitality, there's hope, though. And while ''Hurt Village'' has its problems, being depressing isn't one of them. The production begins with its 13-year-old heroine, Cookie (Joaquina Kalukango), rapping an exultant love-hate poem to Hurt Village, the apartment complex where she has grown up, on the eve of its demolition. When she chants, ''This be the war,'' what she's describing is a daily life in which you're always either armed for combat or as good as dead.
Much of what follows in this play, directed by Patricia McGregor and vividly acted by a cast that includes the formidable Tonya Pinkins, is infused with the locomotive rhythms of that opening declaration of war. ''Hurt Village'' elicits the adrenaline-stoked ambivalence in the competitive rapping and insult swapping that are among its characters' favorite forms of recreation.
Rap, of course, is by now a venerable art form. And the sort of escalating put-downs that are exchanged here have been a staple of sitcoms long before ''The Jeffersons'' (a show referred to with a roll of the eyes) flew up the Nielsen charts. But ''Hurt Village'' is as lucid as any work I know in identifying rap (and dissing) as both a weapon and a release, a brandishing of arms and of affection.
No wonder Cookie, a precocious but improbably innocent girl who brings to mind centuries of fictional portraits of burgeoning artists, wants to grow up to be a rapper. Her gift with a swift comeback rhyme is what's kept her afloat in a world that threatens to drown her.
Cookie lives with her great-grandmother, Big Mama (Ms. Pinkins), a strong but weary orderly at a veterans' hospital, and Crank (Marsha Stephanie Blake), a 26-year-old unemployed hairdresser, who had Cookie when she was 13. Cookie's long-absent father is Big Mama's grandson, Buggy (Corey Hawkins), a soldier who returns to Memphis shortly after the play begins.
They are all confronted with crises that Hansberry's Youngers never had to face. The stoical Big Mama loses it when she discovers, too late to make other plans, that she earns just enough money not to qualify for the new apartment. Crank, who is functionally illiterate, resents the academically gifted Cookie. Crank insists she has no use for Buggy, and she shares her sometime lover and neighbor, Cornbread (Nicholas Christopher), with her friend and rival, Toyia (Saycon Sengbloh).
As for Buggy, he's suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder from his time in Iraq. And he burns to avenge his mother's suicide, for which he blames Tony C (Ron Cephas Jones), the local drug lord. The ensuing turf war divides the neighborhood and pits two friends, Skillet (Lloyd Watts) and Ebony (Charlie Hudson III), against each other.
For all the strictly contemporary elements that feed the overstuffed plot of ''Hurt Village,'' the play also has an air of old-fashioned contrivance. It's definitely more persuasive and organic than ''The Mountaintop,'' a parablelike portrait of the last night in the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But it suffers from the same penchant for artificial dialogue that seems to be pasted onto the characters.
The use of projected Brechtian titles doesn't disguise a feeling that some of the scenes they preface would have creaked long before Hansberry's day. These include a pull-out-all-the-stops monologue in which Big Mama pleads for compassion in a welfare office and a vignette in which Cookie explains a science experiment (involving fleas trying to escape from a jar) with heavy symbolic resonance.
And as lively and infectious as the rap sequences are, some of the more somber conversational lines stop you cold with their strained poetry. (Big Mama: ''I musta did something wrong in another life, cause the more I talked to the sky, the more the moon laughed at me.'')
If the cast members are aware that what they're saying doesn't always come naturally, they never let on. They inhabit David Gallo's evocative urban-jungle jumble of a set (and Clint Ramos's sociologically exact costumes) with fervent and affecting conviction. And they make sure we feel the emotional double edge with which their characters regard one another.
No one is purely good or evil here, not even the long-suffering Big Mama or the murderous Tony C. Friends quickly become foes in this environment, and vice versa. Blame and guilt are everywhere. In ''Raisin'' (a play that also happens to have inspired the Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Clybourne Park,'' by Bruce Norris, which opens on Broadway this spring), the Youngers were able to unite against the common enemy of white, middle-class prejudice. In ''Hurt Village'' the enemy is harder to identify.
When Big Mama, feeling thwarted by the politics of the welfare office, says, ''Them folks don't care nothin' about us,'' Buggy has a sharp and immediate answer that echoes throughout this play: ''Where 'they' hidin' at? I ain't never seen no 'they.' 'They' is you and you and you.''

HEADLINE: A Costly Anachronism

 BODY:
In 1974, Congress enacted the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which limits trade with ''nonmarket'' countries that restrict emigration. While it did not mention the Soviet Union, it was clearly aimed at pressuring Moscow to grant Jews the freedom to leave the country. Two decades after the fall of Communism, that is no longer a problem, but the law is still in place. If Congress does not repeal it soon, the United States will be in violation of World Trade Organization rules and American exporters will pay higher tariffs than competitors for access to Russian markets. 
Since 1992, American presidents have taken advantage of a waiver in the law and granted Russia temporary, normal trade status, which sets lower duties on imports. Moscow has repeatedly asked Washington to make this status permanent, and successive presidents have promised to do so. The issue finally came to a head in December when Russia became the last major economy to win admission to the W.T.O. If Jackson-Vanik is not lifted, American exporters -- including big players such as Caterpillar and Boeing -- will be paying higher tariffs than European and Asian competitors.
This is not an easy time for President Obama to be arguing on behalf of anything that benefits the Russian government. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's autocratic ways are chilling as is his decision to promote his presidential campaign with a particularly scurrilous anti-Americanism. The Kremlin is also the top supporter and arms merchant to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.
More than two dozen members of Congress have endorsed legislation that would deny travel visas to Russian officials linked to human rights abuses and say they will attach it to any bill granting permanent normal trade status with Russia. The inspiration is Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who was arrested and died in prison after trying to expose a huge tax fraud by government officials.
The White House should press Russia publicly and privately on this case and other human rights abuses. But it is time to deal with the trade issue on its own.

HEADLINE: S.&P. 500 Closes at Highest Point Since Mid-2008

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at its highest level since mid-2008 on Monday, extending gains for a third session as oil prices retreated after a recent rally and data showed further improvement in the nation's housing market. 
The S.& P. and the Nasdaq both posted small gains, while the Dow closed barely lower.
An industry group reported that contracts for home resales hit the highest level in nearly two years in January, lifting the Dow Jones home construction index 1.5 percent.
A decline of about 1 percent in the price of oil relieved concerns that high energy prices could hurt the still-fragile economic recovery. Brent crude ended at $124.17, down $1.30.
''Anything above $120 to $130 is clearly the level at which the global economy is going to have a hard time growing at a pace that is consistent with a very robust rate of growth,'' said Natalie Trunow, chief investment officer of equities at Calvert Investment Management in Bethesda, Md.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 1.85 points, or 0.14 percent, at 1,367.59. It has rallied 9 percent since the start of the year, and it rose as high as 1,371.94 on Monday before paring gains.
Though the S.& P. 500 closed below the day's high, it was still its highest finish since June 2008.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 1.44 points, or 0.01 percent, at 12,981.51. The Nasdaq composite index was up 2.41 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,966.16.
The Dow industrials topped 13,000 several times during the day but failed, for the third time in the last five sessions, to close above that level.
Oil's recent rally has been driven by worries over disruptions to Middle East supplies resulting from sanctions against Iran. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Shares of Exxon Mobil ended down 0.1 percent at $87.23.
The fourth-quarter earnings period is in the final stretch. As of Monday, 468 S.& P. 500 companies had reported results, with 63 percent beating analysts' expectations.
On Monday, Lowe's, the home improvement chain, reported higher-than-expected quarterly sales, and its shares rose 18 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $27.34.
Biotech stocks fell after Dendreon said demand was soft for its high-priced Provenge prostate cancer treatment as the year began, and forecast slow sales growth in the first quarter.
Dendreon slumped $3.05, or 20.5 percent, to $11.81. The N.Y.S.E. Arca biotech index lost 1.5 percent.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 15/32, to 100 22/32, and the yield fell to 1.93 percent from 1.98 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: How To Frack Responsibly

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Fracking isn't going away.
To put it another way, the technique of hydraulic fracturing, used to extract natural gas from once-impossible-to-get-at reservoirs like the Marcellus Shale that lies beneath New York and Pennsylvania, has more than proved its value. At this point, shale gas, as it's called, makes up more than 30 percent of the country's natural gas supply, up from 2 percent in 2001 -- a figure that is sure to keep rising. Fracking's enemies can stamp their feet all they want, but that gas is too important to leave it in the ground.
Fred Krupp, the president of the Environmental Defense Fund, understands this as well as anyone. Last summer, he was a member of a small federal advisory panel that was charged by Steven Chu, the secretary of energy, with assessing the problems associated with fracking. The group came up with a long list of environmental issues. But it also concluded that ''the U.S. shale gas resource has enormous potential to provide economic and environmental benefits for the country.'' 
One thing I've always liked about the Environmental Defense Fund is its hardheaded approach. Founded by scientists, it believes in data, not hysteria. It promotes market incentives to change behavior and isn't afraid to work with industry. Utterly nonpartisan, it is oriented toward practical policy solutions.
And that has been its approach to fracking. When I spoke to him recently, Krupp didn't back away from the idea that domestic natural gas could be the ''bridge fuel'' that helps bring us toward a renewable energy future. Unlike others in the environmental movement, he and his colleagues at the Environmental Defense Fund don't want to shut down fracking; rather, their goal is to work with the states where most of the shale gas lies and help devise smart regulations that would make fracking environmentally safer.
Let's take one example: the problem of methane leaks. Every natural gas well leaks methane -- methane is natural gas, after all -- and while the natural gas that winds up being burned as fuel is, indeed, relatively clean, methane that escapes into the air is potent. Though it eventually disintegrates, for several decades methane can add significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.
Question No. 1: How much methane leaks into the air as a result of fracking? Incredibly, nobody knows. The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated the leak rate at a little more than 2 percent, but a recent study suggested it might be twice that. And a controversial Cornell University study last year said it was closer to 6 percent. Clearly, it is critical to know the answer, which is why the Environmental Defenses Fund is currently participating in a study that is expected to provide one.
Question No. 2: How big a difference will it make to the environment if industry can minimize methane leaks? A lot. To illustrate the point, Steven Hamburg, the group's chief scientist, showed me a model he had devised. It allowed me to see the effect on greenhouse gas emissions as methane leaks were reduced. Suppose, for instance, the current leak rate turns out to be 4 percent. Suppose we then reduce it in half. That would mean an immediate reduction in overall U.S. greenhouse gases by -- are you sitting down for this? -- 9 percent. If the leaks are reduced to 1 percent, the decrease in greenhouse gases jumps to 14 percent. (That number eventually gets smaller as the potency of the methane wears off.) Meanwhile, failing to reduce methane leaks largely eliminates the environmental advantage of natural gas over coal. You can plug in different estimates and get different results, but the point is this: There is no denying the huge difference it can make to the environment to reduce methane gas leaks.
Nor is this some kind of impossible dream. ''There are cost-effective ways to reduce methane leaks,'' says Michael Levi, an energy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. In fact, a number of the better producers, like Shell, are already employing technology to minimize leaks and taking other steps to drill for natural gas in a responsible fashion. Nor is there much doubt that the outcry by environmentalists over fracking helped awaken the industry to the problems.
But, of course, not all drillers can be counted on to drill responsibly, which is why regulation is so critical. ''Wouldn't it be better,'' I asked Krupp, ''for fracking to be regulated by the federal government rather than by the states? Wouldn't that mean better, more uniform regulation and tougher enforcement?''
Krupp frowned. ''Given the dysfunction in D.C., a state-by-state approach will be more effective,'' he said. ''We need to focus on getting the rules right, and complied with, in the 14 states which have 85 percent of the onshore gas reserves.''
Here's hoping that the anti-frackers someday join him.

HEADLINE: Michael Douglas Tackles Greed for F.B.I.

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and AZAM AHMED

 BODY:
Gordon Gekko is cooperating with the F.B.I.
No, there's not another big-budget Oliver Stone follow-up to ''Wall Street'' in the works. Instead, Michael Douglas, who played the financier in the 1987 movie and the sequel, is now starring in a straight-to-television video for the Federal Bureau of Investigation meant to root out insider trading - the same crime that brought down the high-flying Mr. Gekko.
A one-minute spot that points out that illicit trading is, in fact, illegal might not seem a priority. But the new video - now showing on CNBC and Bloomberg Television - is part of the government's broader initiative aimed at drawing cooperating witnesses and tipsters from Wall Street. 
For years, insider trading was not a top focus at the bureau, so would-be informants might not have known where to turn, the thinking went. Now that the crime is front-and-center for securities investigators, the video is part reminder, part plea for those who have seen something illegal to say something.
''The movie was fiction, but the problem is real,'' Mr. Douglas, sans the slicked-back hair that his character sported, says in the announcement, which was unveiled on Monday. ''If a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is.''
The video, shot last November in the Trump Hotel in Manhattan, is also an effort to raise the F.B.I.'s public profile. Or, as David A. Chaves, a supervisor and special agent, said on Monday, ''It's important for us to have the F.B.I. brand out on Wall Street.''
For years, the bureau toiled in relative obscurity as federal prosecutors received praise for winning convictions in white-collar cases. Time magazine recently had Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, on its cover with the headline, ''This Man Is Busting Wall Street.''
Yet there are a number of government agencies ferreting out wrongdoing on Wall Street, from the F.B.I. to the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators. To build their cases, investigators are using aggressive tactics once reserved for organized crime and terrorism cases, such as wiretaps and well-placed cooperators.
Add to that arsenal their newest weapon: publicity, compliments of Mr. Douglas.
And, as the F.B.I. noted on Monday, what better spokesman against insider trading than Mr. Gekko, who came to personify Wall Street crime in both the 1980s and in the recent financial crisis with the 2010 sequel, ''Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.''
''The more people out there aware of the problem, the more opportunities we have to get tips,'' said Richard T. Jacobs, a supervisory special agent at the F.B.I. who helped bring the Galleon Group insider trading case, which resulted in the conviction of the billionaire hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam.
The latest federal operation, an outgrowth of the Galleon investigation, is called Perfect Hedge. It has already yielded 64 arrests and ensnared other big names in the hedge fund world. That effort, F.B.I. agents said Monday, is likely to continue for years to come as the network of sources they have developed multiplies and more tips flow in.
But the intense focus on insider trading has drawn criticism from outsiders, who call it a distraction from more important crackdowns. On the heels of the financial crisis, which crippled the global economy, the government has filed few cases tied to wrongdoing at the major banks and lenders that prompted the upheaval.
The idea to create a public service announcement about insider trading began last year, as the bureau worked to broaden the network of potential tipsters on Wall Street. Without a budget to throw cash at the project, the F.B.I. lined up a free production team and several networks that were willing to show their appeal.
And who might star in such a video? ''I thought there was only one person to do it,'' said Mr. Chaves, who came up with the idea. Mr. Douglas, he said, is ''such a revered man in Hollywood and I think just a wonderful person.''
Mr. Douglas, 67, who two decades ago said Gordon Gekko was the best role he ever had, obliged. The actor, who recently underwent treatment for throat cancer, felt he needed to set the record straight about insider trading, Mr. Chaves said.
In the wake of the popularity of the first ''Wall Street,'' Mr. Douglas would receive high-fives and handshakes from real-life traders and bankers when he walked the streets of Manhattan. The Wall Streeters loved Mr. Gekko, who declares in the film that ''greed, for lack of a better word, is good.''
But the outpouring of love for such a character befuddled Mr. Douglas, who won a best-actor Academy Award for his role in the first Wall Street film.
Mr. Douglas wondered why he was being thanked, according to Mr. Chaves, who quoted him as saying: ''I'm a criminal in the movie. Don't they realize that?''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Cities Borrow From Pensions To Pay for Them

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- When New York State officials agreed to allow local governments to use an unusual borrowing plan to put off a portion of their pension obligations, fiscal watchdogs scoffed at the arrangement, calling it irresponsible and unwise.
And now, their fears are being realized: cities throughout the state, wealthy towns such as Southampton and East Hampton, counties like Nassau and Suffolk, and other public employers like the Westchester Medical Center and the New York Public Library are all managing their rising pension bills by borrowing from the very same $140 billion pension fund to which they owe money.
Across New York, state and local governments are borrowing $750 million this year to finance their contributions to the state pension system, and are likely to borrow at least $1 billion more over the next year. The number of municipalities and public institutions using this new borrowing mechanism to pay off their annual pension bills has tripled in a year.
The eagerness to borrow demonstrates that many major municipalities are struggling to meet their pension obligations, which have risen partly because of generous retirement packages for public employees, and partly because turbulence in the stock market has slowed the pension fund's growth. 
The state's borrowing plan allows public employers to reduce their pension contributions in the short term in exchange for higher payments over the long term. Public pension funds around the country assume a certain rate of return every year and, despite the market gains over the last few years, are still straining to make up for steep investment losses incurred in the 2008 financial crisis, requiring governments to contribute more to keep pension systems afloat.
Supporters argue that the borrowing plan makes it possible for governments in New York to ''smooth'' their annual pension contributions to get through this prolonged period of market volatility.
Critics say it is a budgetary sleight-of-hand that simply kicks pension costs down the road.
''You're undermining the long-term solvency of these funds and making the pension fund even more of a gamble than it already is,'' said Josh Barro, a senior fellow and pension expert at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research organization. The state, he said, is betting that the performance of the financial markets will improve over the next decade and bail the system out.
''If performance continues to be weak, then contribution rates will be even higher than the rates we're trying to avoid now, and you'll produce even more fiscal pain down the road,'' he said.
Nationwide, the cost of public retiree benefits has soared in recent years, and states including California, Connecticut and Illinois have been borrowing to pay, or even deferring, their pension bills. Many states are worse off than New York. New Jersey is still paying off bonds issued in 1997 to close a hole in its pension system.
And governors and lawmakers across the country have been trying to take steps to reduce future pension costs, with limited success.
But New York appears to be unusual in allowing public employers to borrow from the state's pension system to finance their annual contributions to that system.
The state's borrowing mechanism, approved in 2010 under Gov. David A. Paterson, was backed by public sector unions and by the state comptroller's office, which oversees the pension fund and prefers to call the borrowing a form of amortization, or paying a debt gradually, with interest. The public employers that borrow from the pension system essentially contribute less than they owe in a given year, and agree to repay the difference, with interest, over a decade.
Contributions to the pension system, which covers more than one million members, retirees and beneficiaries, are due annually from the state and municipal governments. As they struggle to pay their obligations under the current system, municipalities are borrowing $200 million this year, up from $45 million last year, the first year the borrowing plan was available, according to the state comptroller's office.
''I don't think any financial manager likes to see the can kicked down the road, and would prefer to see all costs paid for in the years that they are incurred,'' said Tamara Wright, the comptroller of Southampton. Southampton, on the East End of Long Island, recently borrowed a fifth of its pension bill -- $1.2 million of $6 million -- by decision of the town board.
''I certainly am sensitive to the board's concerns about the current economic times,'' she said.
The state is borrowing too -- $575 million in the current fiscal year, and $782 million in the next, under a budget proposed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.
The state's comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, said in a statement, ''While the state's pension fund is one of the strongest performers in the country, costs have increased due to the Wall Street meltdown.'' He added that ''amortizing pension costs is an option for some local governments to manage cash flow and to budget for long-term pension costs in good and bad times.''
The comptroller's office noted that only a part of the overall pension contributions owed by the state and municipalities was being borrowed. And it said the number of borrowers had risen partly because the borrowing plan only recently became available.
''It would not be fair to draw a characterization about statewide municipal finances from these numbers,'' said Kevin Murray, an executive deputy in the comptroller's office.
But it is clear that a number of major public employers are having trouble affording the state's current pension system.
''Sharp increases in pension costs are unsustainable and are devastating state and local governments,'' Robert Megna, Governor Cuomo's budget director, said in a statement.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, is proposing changes that would require future state employees to share a greater portion of their pension costs, and would allow them to opt into a 401(k)-style retirement plan. The proposal is known as Tier VI because it would be added to five existing pension benefit categories.
The governor's proposal has been met coldly by labor unions, as well as by many state lawmakers and Mr. DiNapoli, also a Democrat and an ally of the labor movement. The proposal is supported by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York as well as other municipal leaders, and by business groups.
''It's the most significant rising cost that we have,'' Scott Adair, the chief financial officer of Monroe County, said of pensions.
In Poughkeepsie, which is contributing $3.6 million into the state pension system this year and borrowing nearly $800,000, Mayor John C. Tkazyik, a Republican, said rising pension costs and new federal accounting requirements for retiree health coverage could have dire consequences.
''It could bankrupt the city,'' Mr. Tkazyik said, adding that the city had cut its work force, to 367 from 418 employees, in four years as it struggled to compensate.
The New York Public Library is borrowing nearly $2.9 million of a $14.7 million pension bill this year. A library spokeswoman said the decision to borrow came at the urging of the city, which finances a majority of the library's budget. The city has its own pension system, separate from the state, which has undergone its own fiscal stresses because of sharp contribution increases.
''After a strong recommendation from the city, the library decided to amortize its pension payments because of the cost savings to both the library and the city, which reimburses more than half of our pension costs,'' said Angela Montefinise, the library spokeswoman.
But the Bloomberg administration played down its role.
''The library system decides how to manage their finances,'' said Marc LaVorgna, a Bloomberg spokesman, adding, ''The decision was made by the libraries.''

HEADLINE: Michigan a Testing Ground for Doubt on Romney

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG; Michael Barbaro contributed reporting from Rockford, Mich., and Katharine Q. Seelye from Lansing, Mich.

 BODY:
ROYAL OAK, Mich. -- The Michigan presidential primary on Tuesday offers Rick Santorum -- and skeptical conservatives -- the best chance yet to turn nagging questions about Mitt Romney into deep doubts about his candidacy.
His defeat could send the nominating fight onto an unpredictable path and reset the Republican race.
But a victory here for Mr. Romney, along with one in the Arizona primary the same day, could help cool the misgivings that some Republicans have raised about him -- just in time for a challenging run of Super Tuesday contests next week that will allow another wave of voters to render judgment.
The Republican nominating contest, now entering its third month, remains alive with uncertainty. On Monday came word that Newt Gingrich had received another major infusion of support from Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate and his chief benefactor, to help pay for advertising in seven states. 
Representative Ron Paul of Texas, who has devoted most of his time organizing for a coming round of caucuses, drew large crowds to rallies in Michigan on the eve of the primary here. And as the race becomes a fight for delegates, Mr. Santorum has a few million dollars on hand, aides said, and a growing team of 20 new aides and a volunteer director already at work on the March 13 Hawaii caucuses.
The Santorum campaign, newly emboldened in its head-to-head confrontation here with Mr. Romney, sent Democrats telephone messages on Monday, reminding them that they, too, can vote in Michigan's primary. The outcome of the race -- and any last-minute mischief -- will provide a compass for the rest of the Republican nominating contest.
''We took it to him in his home state,'' said Michael Biundo, the campaign manager for Mr. Santorum. ''Either way we end up here, we're winners.''
At a Chamber of Commerce breakfast on Monday, Mr. Santorum was surrounded by Secret Service agents for the first time. He argued that Mr. Romney was ''uniquely unqualified'' to defeat President Obama because of the health care plan he signed as governor of Massachusetts. ''Why would we give this issue away?'' Mr. Santorum declared. ''It is the biggest issue in this race.''
Mr. Romney showed signs of confidence as he breezed onto the stage at the Royal Oak Music Theater on Monday night after a full day of campaigning. He presented himself as the best-equipped candidate to run on the economy, but still devoted much of his time during the day to Mr. Santorum, rather than his preferred target, Mr. Obama.
''Whoever wins Michigan won't get that many more delegates,'' G. Scott Romney, the candidate's older brother and a Detroit lawyer, said in an interview. ''But it has a momentum effect as we keep going on to the next several states.''
Here is a look at some of the dynamics that will be in play on Tuesday as Republicans vote in Michigan and Arizona, as well as the consequences beyond those contests as the presidential race heads into March.
Every Which Way He Can
Here in Michigan, Mr. Santorum has taken on Mr. Romney's former role. Where Mr. Romney won in Michigan four years ago by portraying himself as the conservative alternative to Senator John McCain of Arizona, Mr. Santorum now holds that title in relation to Mr. Romney.
And Mr. Santorum has attacked Mr. Romney as a lesser conservative on several fronts, including his support for an individual mandate for health insurance in Massachusetts and, as governor, for emission limits at some state power plants.
Mr. Santorum has made appeals to religious voters in ways that Mr. Romney, who supported abortion rights until 2005, cannot, stressing his opposition to abortion and the fact that he is a Roman Catholic who home-schools his children.
Mr. Romney has succeeded in piercing Mr. Santorum's conservative credentials by repeatedly pressing him for his own comments in last week's debate, in which he said he had voted against his own principles out of party loyalty to ''take one for the team.''
And some of Mr. Santorum's more provocative comments on religion have not helped, including his warning in 2008 -- publicized heavily last week by the Drudge Report-- that Satan had ''set his sights on the United States of America.''
Speaking of the Satan comment at a rally for Mr. Santorum in Arizona last week, a supporter, Cheryl Rosado, 30, said it made her wonder if Mr. Romney would fare better in the fall. Though she agreed with the warning, she said, ''I wouldn't say it at work.''
Blue-Collar Bounce
For all the talk about Mr. Santorum's position on social issues, he is also aggressively pushing to win over blue-collar workers here, including Democrats who are allowed to vote in the state's open primary on Tuesday and could make a critical difference if the race is as tight as polls suggest.
The campaign has taken the extraordinary step of placing automated telephone calls to Democratic households, telling them, ''Michigan Democrats can vote in the Republican primary.'' The message adds an item of local interest, saying: ''Romney supported the bailouts for his Wall Street billionaire buddies but opposed the auto bailouts. That was a slap in the face to every Michigan worker, and we're not going to let Romney get away with it.''
Here in Michigan, where the term ''Reagan Democrat'' was born because of those who voted for Ronald Reagan in the counties outside Detroit, Mr. Santorum told voters that he could repeat Mr. Reagan's success -- with their help -- here and in other manufacturing states, chief among them Ohio next week.
There is one hitch: Mr. Santorum opposed the auto bailout as well.
''I know that's not a popular topic here in Detroit, but at least I'm consistent,'' Mr. Santorum told a crowd on Monday, reminding Republicans that he opposed the federal bailout of Wall Street, unlike Mr. Romney.
He also has been quick to play up his own working-class roots as the grandson of a coal miner who grew up in the steel-producing area of Pennsylvania, a sharp contrast with his rival, who has stumbled with talk of owning several Cadillacs and, on Sunday, as he visited the Daytona 500, declared. ''I have some great friends who are Nascar team owners.''
Gingrich, Again
Twice Mr. Gingrich has been counted out of the Republican race, and twice he has come back. Now, he is vowing to stage another surge, and none of his remaining rivals is going to make the mistake of prematurely writing him off again.
Mr. Gingrich decided against competing in Michigan in any real way, a nod to his own low poll numbers in the state. But that also had the added benefit of allowing Mr. Santorum to coalesce the anti-Romney vote for maximum effect.
While Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum were attacking each other, with Mr. Paul spending his time in states with upcoming caucuses, Mr. Gingrich had the Super Tuesday state of Tennessee to himself on Monday, where he appeared alongside Fred D. Thompson, the state's former Republican senator and a popular actor.
Polls already show Mr. Gingrich competing strongly next week in Georgia, where he hopes to begin building his next comeback, and, with help from his newly rejuvenated ''super PAC,'' in other Southern states as well, including Mississippi and Alabama. With the injection of new money from Mr. Adelson, the super PAC will begin a $1.7 million television advertising campaign on Wednesday.
''The same media which said I was dead in the fall, I was ahead in December, I was dead in early January, I was ahead in mid-January, all of the sudden some of them are going to say,'' Mr. Gingrich said Monday. ''Gingrich will be back again.''

HEADLINE: Report Says China Puts Growth at Risk Unless It Eases Grip on Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- A new study by the World Bank and a Chinese government research organization warns that the country's economic growth is likely to diminish over the next few decades unless China alters its development model and rethinks the role of government in managing the economy.
The report, called ''China 2030,'' and produced by the bank and the Development Research Center, the government research organization, calls on Beijing to complete the transition to a market economy, scale back the power of state-owned companies, encourage private enterprise and confront rising inequality and environmental degradation. 
As remarkable as China's growth has been over the past three decades, the study suggests that the country's development pattern has been uneven and is unsustainable. The government should make significant changes, it says.
''The case for reform is compelling because China has now reached a turning point in its development path,'' Robert B. Zoellick, president of the World Bank, said in a speech in Beijing on Monday, when the report was released. ''Managing the transition from a middle-income to a high-income country will prove challenging; add to this a global environment that will likely remain uncertain and volatile for the foreseeable future, and the need for change assumes even greater importance.''
The release of the report comes at a critical juncture. China is now in the midst of a once-in-a-decade leadership transition, and the report's proposals could help influence the way the next generation of leaders governs.
Analysts also have growing concerns that China's economy is facing strong headwinds this year.
Economic weakness in Europe, Japan and the United States is threatening to dampen China's export boom. After years of heavy investment in public works, there are worries here, too, about inflation, the mounting debt of local governments and the possibility that big state-owned banks could be at risk.
Mr. Zoellick said in news conferences on Monday that he was reassured that the government would undertake bold changes and that he expected China's economy to remain strong this year, with a soft landing likely.
The 400-page report, however, says little about the immediate challenges facing China's economy. Instead, it lays out a road map packed with recommendations that the authors hope will lead to gradual reforms introduced over many years, if not over a decade or more.
If all goes well and China undertakes serious changes, the study predicts, its economy could grow by about 8 percent a year for the next few years and could sustain average annual growth of about 6.6 percent for nearly 20 years.
That annual growth, the study says, is likely to slow eventually to about 5 percent in the years leading up to 2030, more than enough to enable China to surpass the United States as the world's biggest economy.
Although the risks of a global economic downturn are a concern, the report said, bigger risks may arise from internal structural challenges, like weak domestic consumption, overinvestment in public works and increases in inequality.
Nicholas R. Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington and the author of ''Sustaining China's Economic Growth After the Global Financial Crisis,'' called the report a thorough benchmark assessment of China and its economy.
But he also said the study failed to offer detailed prescriptions for reforms or to explain why previous efforts had stalled.
''Many of these issues have been on the agenda for at least a decade,'' Mr. Lardy said in a telephone interview. ''But the report doesn't even attempt to explain what obstacles there are to doing these things. Until you shine a light on those things, it will be very difficult to understand why the changes haven't taken place.''
One of the study's main recommendations involves efforts to make China's economy more market-oriented, including scaling back the power of state-owned companies and altering the way the government allocates resources.
''The role of the government and its relationship to markets and the private sector need to change fundamentally,'' the report warned.
The study said that state-owned enterprises should be more commercially oriented, and that the government needed to improve financing opportunities for private companies and to expand the overhaul of the banking and financial sectors.
These changes, the report said, would cause state banks to compete more vigorously for customers and operate on a more commercial basis, eventually paving the way for financial reform and improving the integration of China's currency, the renminbi, into the international economy.
Analysts said the emphasis on proposals to change the state sector seemed surprisingly ambitious, particularly because one of the authors, the Development Research Center, operates under China's cabinet, or State Council. There has been a contentious debate in China in recent years about the power of state-owned companies and about vested interests that try to derail any reforms.
''This represents an attempt to put some more momentum behind the push to rein in the state sector,'' Andrew Batson, the research director at GK Dragonomics, a research company in Beijing, said of the study.
The report stopped well short of calling for the breakup or privatization of state-owned companies. But it did suggest that the ownership structure of state companies be diversified. The study also said that China's fiscal system should be overhauled, an undertaking that would probably make local governments less dependent on land auctions for revenue.
Among other things, the study called for China to build world-class universities, put greater emphasis on innovation, initiate land reform and improve the social safety net, while also moving to better integrate the country into the global economy.
Because local governments and state-run enterprises are powerful and often resist changes that would weaken their standing, it is unclear whether the report's recommendations will be adopted or even considered seriously by the government.
Despite calls from within China's leadership to bolster consumption and encourage private enterprise, reform has been slow in recent years. Part of the reason, experts say, is that China's export- and investment-led growth has been so successful that few leaders have been willing to press for radical adjustments for fear that they could undermine growth in the short run.
But the World Bank and researchers from the Development Research Center in Beijing contend that without significant structural changes over time, China could face serious economic and social risks in the future, challenges likely to be amplified as it tries to cope with an aging population, a weak social safety net and a widening gap between the rich and the poor.

HEADLINE: Bending Tax Code For A.I.G.

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Last week, the American International Group reported a whopping $19.8 billion profit for its fourth quarter. It was a quite a feat for a company that was on its death bed just a little over three years ago, so sick that it needed a huge taxpayer bailout.
But if you dug into the numbers, it quickly became clear that $17.7 billion of that profit was pure fantasy - a tax benefit, er, gift, from the United States government. The company made only $1.6 billion during the quarter from actual operations. Yet A.I.G. not only received a tax benefit, it is unlikely to pay a cent of taxes this year, nor by some estimates, for at least a decade. 
The tax benefit is notable for more than simply its size. It is the result of a rule that the Treasury unilaterally bent for A.I.G. and several other hobbled companies in 2008 that has largely been overlooked.
This rule-twisting could deprive the government of tens of billions of dollars, assuming the firm remains profitable. The tax dodge -- and let's be honest, that's what it is -- also will most likely help goose the bonuses of A.I.G.'s employees, some of whom helped create many of the problems that led to its role in the financial crisis.
''We suggest that Congress give its members standing to challenge such manipulation in court,'' J. Mark Ramseyer, a Harvard professor, and Eric B. Rasmusen, a professor at Indiana University, wrote in a paper last year. The paper provocatively asked: ''Can the Treasury Exempt Its Own Companies From Tax?'' (While the paper addressed A.I.G, it focused on the tax treatment bestowed on another bailout recipient, General Motors. Citigroup, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also received similar treatment.)
Here's the back story: A.I.G.'s tax benefit comes in large part from its immense ''net operating losses'' during its depths of despair in 2008 before its rescue. The government had to dump $182 billion into the company after it was crippled by bad bets it had made insuring mortgage-backed securities.
The tax benefit comes in the form of something called net operating losses - NOLs in Wall Street parlance - that could be worth more than $25 billion, possibly more. Those losses can be very valuable, in part because companies can spread them over many years to lower or wipe out their income tax bills.
However, according to longstanding tax laws, if a company files for bankruptcy or is taken over, it loses the ability to use its net operating losses. A.I.G. would fit that profile perfectly: on the verge of bankruptcy, the federal government took control of A.I.G., exchanging its bailout billions for shares in the company. The government - taxpayers - still own 77 percent of the company, down from 92 percent three years ago.
Still, the Treasury issued ''notices'' exempting A.I.G. from losing its right to make use of its net operating losses. In total, the insurer estimated that those losses were worth $26.2 billion as of 2009, and it claimed almost $9 billion in other ''unrealized loss on investments.''
Analysts at Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase last year estimated that the tax benefits from the losses propped up A.I.G. stock by $5 to $6 a share. Its shares closed at $28.66 on Monday, just shy of the $29 mark that the government says it needs to sell its shares to break even.
A.I.G. believes that these losses are so valuable that it has a poison pill to bar a corporate takeover.
All of this brings us to the inevitable questions: How did this happen? Why would Treasury exempt A.I.G. from the law? And if taxpayers own a majority of A.I.G., aren't we the beneficiaries of the rule-bending?
A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment, as did a spokesman for A.I.G.
However, senior Treasury officials said privately that they had exempted A.I.G. because they did not consider the rescue to be a traditional takeover. The original law preventing companies from using the losses after a takeover were intended to prevent corporations from buying failing companies with lots of losses simply for the tax benefits.
Moreover, the officials said A.I.G.'s tax benefit would help taxpayers because it would raise the insurer's share price. That may be true, but that assumes that the government is able to sell its shares and exit its investment. That's still a big ''if.'' (Though I do bet it will eventually happen.)
The tax break for A.I.G. also perversely benefits employees who are paid based on the company's performance and usually in stock, which is being lifted by this backdoor handout. The biggest beneficiary is Robert H. Benmosche, A.I.G.'s chief executive since 2009, who has been granted tens of thousands of shares.
In the meantime, the government - desperate to increase revenues - is missing an easy stream of guaranteed taxes from a company that taxpayers bailed out. Sure, the tax bill might hurt the price of A.I.G.'s stock price in the short term, but if Mr. Benmosche does his job right, the company won't have to post fantasy profits.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Praise the Debt Crisis And Pass the Foie Gras

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Tennis fans have the Tennis channel. World War II buffs have History. Billionaires have Bloomberg TV. It's a cable business-news outlet that serves as a tonic for beleaguered tycoons.
And that's why it was safe for four hedge-fund managers to discuss their feelings with the Bloomberg anchor Betty Liu over wine, foie gras and venison loin on a new quarterly show, ''Titans at the Table'' that had its premiere on Bloomberg TV last week and is now available online.
In a private dining room of the Modern, the Danny Meyer restaurant at the Museum of Modern Art, Steve Kuhn, the head of fixed-income trading at Pine River Capital Management, explained why he was so bullish on subprime mortgages. 
''Since the mortgage crisis, what's been wonderful is a lot of our competitors have gone away,'' Mr. Kuhn said. ''Fannie and Freddie are gone.''
The guests were guarded at first, but by the third glass of wine Jamie Zimmerman, chief executive officer of Litespeed Capital, a hedge fund that specializes in distressed companies, was almost gleeful. ''I'm having a wonderful time at work now because there are a lot of things that are going bankrupt,'' she said.
That's Wall Street talk, which doesn't always translate well to a family in foreclosure in Florida or a shop owner facing Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Nevada. But it matches the patois of Bloomberg TV, which celebrates profit and tries to humanize the markets. Gigi Stone, a Bloomberg correspondent, reported that an Academy Award is critical to a movie studio's bottom line. ''It all comes down to the Benjamins,'' she exclaimed.
Sometimes the channel even anthropomorphizes currencies. In a segment about European debt, an anchor gave a shout-out to the Euro, praising its feisty fighting spirit.
Bloomberg TV looks a lot like its two rivals, CNBC and Fox Business Network -- overcaffeinated anchors, pulsating stock tickers and fast-moving news crawls -- but has a different sensibility.
CNBC, perhaps reflecting the liberal bent of its sister cable channel, MSNBC, has a Jacobin streak that plays out in documentaries with titles like ''House of Cards'' and ''Filthy Rich'' that target insider trading, subprime mortgage bundling, Ponzi schemes, Wall Street bankers and foreign plutocrats.
Fox Business Network leans toward Fox News. A recent report on the rising price of oil was illustrated with a finger-wagging calculation of how much President Obama's fuel expenditures are costing the taxpayer when he travels on Air Force One: $179,000 a flight.
Bloomberg TV, which gives information away, is, almost by definition, the opposite of Bloomberg L.P., its parent company. Before he became New York's mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, built that billion-dollar empire on terminals that provide arcane financial data and complex analysis to big-time subscribers.
Bloomberg TV doesn't offer exclusive information or insider tips. Instead, in a blandly pleasant tone, it dispenses news investors can use, always emphasizing the bright side with headlines like ''Profiting From Debt Crisis.''
Which isn't to say that the Occupy Wall Street movement hasn't cast a shadow even on Bloomberg TV. It turned out that addressing public rage at Wall Street -- gingerly -- was at the top of the agenda of ''Titans at the Table.'' The guests talked about China, the presidential election and hedge funds, but most of all they talked about the rise of the 99 percent.
''One of the things politically and personally I worry about in our industry is that we are about to get demonized again,'' James Chanos, president and founder of the hedge fund Kynikos Associates, said. Mr. Chanos is best known for betting against Enron and is now shorting China. He spoke up after a phalanx of servers lifted five porcelain salvers in unison, releasing a floccus of steam from each dish.
Ms. Zimmerman, indignant, tried to object.
''I'm not saying fairly,'' Mr. Chanos interjected quickly. He explained that he was concerned that all the ado over Mitt Romney's wealth (''Bain, carried interest, Cayman islands'') would revive public animosity toward the haves.
Rising income inequality, the titans said, was hard to justify to the have-nots.
Michael E. Novogratz, a director of the Fortress Investment Group, said he tried to explain why Wall Street traders make such astronomical sums when he and his son visited Occupy Wall Street demonstrators last year.
''You can try to take time and explain why it's happened, globalization, intellectual capital being worth more than labor, us being in a very lucky industry in that we're in the center of an intellectual capital industry,'' Mr. Novogratz said. ''Those arguments fall deaf on people that are angry.''
He said he gave up and instead listened to the protesters. ''They perceived there was an undue -- and I'm not sure I would agree with this last point -- amount of influence being used by the people who have the money to really rig the game even further.''
No one broached the fraught topic of bailouts and being too big to fail, but several of the hedge fund managers said they could understand why so many average Americans were frustrated by a system that seems rigged in favor of the rich. ''There is certainly influence being used by people who have money to move the game,'' Mr. Novogratz said delicately.
And soon it was time for dessert.

HEADLINE: Thinker, Tailor

BYLINE: JACOB BROWN


HIGHLIGHT: Siki Im, architect by training, translates a complex worldview into highly appealing clothes. 

 BODY:
It's unclear whether any rats were actually spotted that night, but the abandoned meatpacking plant where Siki Im, a German-born designer of Korean descent, presented his first men's collection back in September of 2009 must have played host to a varmint or two. As editors arrived, a noisy band set up in the middle of the damp concrete floor. As the band drummed, the models - clad like castaways in bits and pieces of fine tailoring - encircled the band and audience. There was no fire pit in the middle, but there could have been.
Conjuring the spirit of William Golding's "Lord of the Flies" in order to introduce a line of exquisitely constructed men's suits seemed odd at the time, but odd in a good way, the perfect antidote to an overly commercial moment. It also felt brave: as New York continued to descend into the financial crisis, here was an upstart showing well-made suits with skirts, sleeveless suits and shorts/slacks with straps and bandages.
A few years before, Im had graduated from the Oxford Brookes School of Architecture, in London, and gone to work at a boutique architecture firm in New York. But throughout his studies he had idolized Helmut Lang, and he eventually got an opportunity he had long dreamed of: to work at Helmut Lang - albeit the Helmut-less Helmut Lang. Designing for what was now a large commercial company turned out to be an essential learning experience for Im. He discovered how product lines, merchandising and factories worked. But it didn't live up to what he had imagined creatively. "I mean just the name, you know?" he says. "Lang's design aesthetic changed everything."
So he decided to strike out on his own, despite the bad economy. 
As architects do when pitching a client, Im always begins a collection with an elaborate intellectual concept. This can be tricky, particularly in men's fashion, in which "concept" feels very art school very fast. And New York, as opposed to a city like London, doesn't easily forgive self-indulgent concept; it prefers a good business plan.
Im has pulled off both. His spring-summer 2010 collection successfully used the "Lord of the Flies" reference to establish a new grammar of tailoring: buttons and fasteners should all be covered, jacket pockets should fold over origami-like at the top to form a triangular flap, shirts should be tunic length under jackets, the skirt should interchange freely with the suit pant. While the styling and staging felt tribal, the actual pieces were more refined. Im seemed to imagine the island's society as a tabula rasa, asking himself: What would a new beginning for men's wear look like if I started it myself?
That debut proved he could translate high concept into functional, appealing, touch-it-and-feel-it clothes. His next collection was Wall Street-inspired, and seemed to cement Siki Im as a tailoring line. He discarded that identity the following season when he spun flowing silk sportswear out of an interest in "La Haine," the French film about xenophobia. Fall 2011 mined American Indian and Amish ideas of geometry and shape.
The current spring collection, called "The Topography of Globalization," would appear to be his most overtly political - although Im professes a different intention.
"I'm definitely influenced by academics who seem to have a more socialist leaning," he says, mentioning people like the French philosophers Jean Baudrillard and Gilles Deleuze. But "it's not their political opinion I am interested in - rather it's their cultural and social theories and observations that help in my design process."
In the notes that accompanied the spring show, references to Westernization, globalization and the Arab Spring were interwoven with quotes from the American Marxist philosopher and literary critic Fredric Jameson. The connection of such wide-ranging ideas to design, as Im put it, comes from the idea that globalization necessarily involves an import and an export. And he sees his collection posing an important question: If the Arab Spring represents - at least in part - an import of western democracy to the Middle East, what gets exported back to the West?
But here's the thing: you can forget all of that. You don't need to read those notes, or even care about them to like the clothes. And you certainly don't need to see how pieces were styled in the show to wear them. Just know that the cargo pockets are subtle. The prints are vaguely reminiscent of desert camo. The shirts and scarves are generous and draped. And the Siki Im grammar speaks volumes.

HEADLINE: How Meritocracy Divides Us

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: How upper-class self-segregation leads to working-class decline. 

 BODY:
Noah Millman, whose new blog at the American Conservative is well worth your time, raises a question about my qualified praise for Charles Murray's "Coming Apart," and particularly about my endorsement of Murray's argument that the growth of a meritocratic elite has had negative consequences for the Americans who haven't joined it:
I still want to hear the mechanism by which meritocracy causes trouble for the struggling working class. I'm assuming the mechanism is that the self-perpetuating "winners" of society come not to care about members of the working class, and conspire to promote their own interests to the detriment of those of the working class. But such an argument requires a view as to what that conspiracy consists of - how working class interests are frustrated in the real world. Are they prevented from organizing politically? Or forming unions to promote their economic interests vis-a-vis their employers? Are their wages being forced down by high levels of immigration, or by free-trade? Are taxes diverted to projects and services that benefit the meritocratic elite, and diverted away from areas that are predominantly working-class?
If I understand correctly, the argument Murray makes is that the negative impact is cultural. The "cultural elite" looks down on working-class culture, and at the same time the cultural elite declines to promulgate their own, more stable lifestyles as an aspirational goal for working-class families. To caricature the argument, if wealthy people drank more Bud and went hunting more often, working-class men would work harder to emulate the wealthy by staying employed and marrying their girlfriends ...
I wouldn't use the word "conspiracy," but I do think that some of the specific examples Millman cites are on point: Among both liberals and conservative elites, there's often an indifference to issues and problems that directly impact working class life but that cut against upper middle interests and concerns. (Democrats don't like to talk about the costs of mass immigration, Republicans tend to focus all their tax-reforming energy on reducing marginal tax rates at the top, etc.)
That said, the core causal mechanism that Murray identifies has to do with the distribution of human capital rather than the meritocratic elite's public policy priorities (or its taste in alcohol and recreational activities). The creation of an aptitude-based elite, he argues, has inevitably segregated America by talent: More than at any point in our history, the smartest people generally go to high school and certainly to college with one another, move en masse to "creative cities" after college, marry their fellow high achievers and then raise their kids in the cocoons of what Murray calls the SuperZips. The problem with this system isn't that the meritocrats look down on working-class culture (though "Coming Apart" does get in plenty of digs at elite snobbery). Rather, it's that the meritocrats don't in working class culture, and that "assortative mating" and geographic clustering have deprived lower-income communities of the social capital (and with it, strong civic institutions, political influence, and so on) that the smart and diligent possess. In this sense, Murray's analysis follows the late, great Christopher Lasch in arguing that meritocracy works almost well: Plucking the best and brightest from every walk of life and then encouraging them to live in community almost exclusively with one another means that the rest of the country is deprived of people who otherwise would have been local leaders, local entrepreneurs, the hubs of local social networks, etc.
This explains why Murray's general case for civic renewal at the end of "Coming Apart" includes a specific appeal to the new upper class, urging them to consider buying homes and joining local associations and raising their high-achieving children closer to the author's blue collar "Fishtown," and outside the cocoon of the SuperZIPS. This is not, to my mind, an entirely plausible vision; indeed, it has some of the same unrealism about human nature that you sometimes hear from those progressives who blame failed and failing public schools on the "selfish" parents who opt out of them (whether via private schooling or homeschooling or SuperZIP cocooning). And here again, as I said in my column on the book, I think Murray is far too dismissive of the public policy component in shaping the trends that he describes. (An America with easier commutes, more telecommuting and cheaper rents in SuperZIPs, for instance, might be somewhat less segregated by social and economic class.)
But as a diagnosis, I think his analysis of how meritocracy divides us is pretty much spot-on, and enormously important to understanding the state of our national life today. One of the epigraphs to my own book on Harvard and elite education was taken from Lasch's "Revolt of the Elites: "Meritocracy," it read, "is a parody of democracy." One of the virtues of "Coming Apart" is that it demonstrates exactly what that means in practice.

HEADLINE: Fitting the Tax Code to Today's Businesses

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: In seeking to overhaul the corporate tax system, it is important to look beyond corporations when thinking about the taxation of businesses, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
One area where Republicans and Democrats are in agreement on tax policy is that the United States should reduce its statutory corporate tax rate to no more than 28 percent from 35 percent. While this is a good idea, provided that it is paid for with base-broadening so that it does not add to the deficit, it is important to look beyond corporations when thinking about the taxation of businesses.
Traditional corporations - called C-corporations - have been declining as a form of business organization for many years. A recent report by the Joint Committee on Taxation found there were 1.9 million C-corporations in 1978 and 1.8 million in 2008. Over that period, the total number of businesses in the United States grew to 33.6 million from 15.2 million.
The number of C-corporations peaked at 2.6 million in 1986, when they constituted 13 percent of all businesses. By 2008, they had fallen to 5.4 percent. The key reason is that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 lowered the top federal income tax rate beneath the corporate tax rate for the first time.

Historically, the corporate tax rate was well below the top individual rate. During the 1950s, the corporate rate was 52 percent while the top individual rate was 91 percent; in the 1970s, the corporate rate was 48 percent and the top individual rate was 70 percent. On the eve of the Tax Reform Act, the corporate rate was 46 percent and the top individual rate was 50 percent.
The Tax Reform Act lowered the corporate rate to 34 percent and reduced the top individual rate to 28 percent. Thus, through most of the history of the income tax, C-corporations provided tax-sheltering opportunities for rich people. But after 1986, it became advantageous for rich people to reorganize their business affairs as S-corporations.
An S-corporation is a special type of corporation with a limited number of shareholders. Its key advantage is that income passes through to the shareholders without incurring a tax at the corporate level -- that is, income is taxed only once. By contrast, income earned by C-corporations is taxed twice - at the corporate level and again when its profits are paid to shareholders in the form of dividends.
Thus the maximum tax rate on income earned by S-corporations is the top individual rate of 35 percent. The rate on income earned by C-corporations would be 35 percent at the corporate level plus 15 percent on dividends paid, or 45 percent in total. (A dollar earned at the corporate level leaves 65 cents after tax; the additional 15 percent claims another 9.75 cents on the same income.)
S-corporations provide the same tax treatment that has long applied to sole proprietorships and partnerships. This is the major reason that the number of S-corporations has increased fourfold since 1986, to 12.1 percent today from 3.1 percent of all business in 1978. The percentage of sole proprietorships and partnerships has also increased.
According to a joint White House-Treasury Department report released last week, C-corporations reported 87 percent of all business receipts in 1980 and 78 percent of the total net income. In 2008, they accounted for 64 percent of gross receipts and 27 percent of the net income.
Gross receipts by partnerships rose to 14 percent of business receipts from 3 percent, sole proprietorships saw their share fall to 4 percent from 6 percent and S-corporations raised theirs to 18 percent from 3 percent. In terms of net income, the percentage accruing to partnerships went to 32 percent from 3 percent, to 19 percent for sole proprietorships from 18 percent and to 22 percent for S-corporations from 1 percent.
In short, so-called pass-through entities that are taxed only at the individual level represent the largest form of business organization, and one that has grown rapidly since 1986.
A new report from the Congressional Research Service examines pass-through entities and their economic significance. It notes that many are passive, tax-avoidance entities. At least 25 percent of partnership income and 10 percent of S-corporation income is passive.
The report also notes the distribution of income within pass-through entities. The vast bulk of partnership and S-corporation income is earned at the high end; much more of that for sole proprietorships is earned in the middle of the distribution.
Many analysts believe that the tax treatment among different forms of business organization ought to be equalized. The White House-Treasury report estimates that the effective marginal tax rate on new investments is 32.3 percent for C-corporations and only 26.4 percent for pass-through entities. This distortion biases economic decision-making and is ultimately bad for growth.
Although most of the talk today is about lowering tax rates on C-corporations, the economic distortion could also be eliminated by raising taxes on pass-through entities. One suggestion is to treat those above a certain size as C-corporations.
It is important to understand is that the vast bulk of businesses are not traditional corporations. Thus tax incentives targeting C-corporations may be less effective economically than their advocates believe. Conversely, tax policies related to individuals may be more important for businesses than is generally understood.

HEADLINE: In Romney's Old Neighborhood, Voters Worry More About the Future

BYLINE: STEVEN YACCINO


HIGHLIGHT: In Bloomfield Hills, voters care about the economy and social issues. 

 BODY:
BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. - Many voters left their cars running in the parking lot early Tuesday morning, the exhaust visible in the brisk air, as they filtered in and out of a firehouse here, where eight voting booths were lined up near a fire engine.
Mitt Romney has been spending a lot of time and money in recent weeks touting his local roots, reminding voters that he grew up in Michigan as the son of an auto executive and popular governor. "Michigan's been my home, and this is personal," he said in one ad that has been running throughout the state. 
Perhaps nowhere else are voters more aware of that fact than here in Bloomfield Hills. 
"He grew up over the hill there," said Rick Williams, 70, who voted for Mr. Romney and said growing up, he was a classmate of one of Mr. Romney's brothers. "We could walk to his house." 
Mr. Williams said he thought the local ties would ultimately help Mr. Romney in Tuesday's primary, but most voters here, even those who supported Mr. Romney, said it barely factored into their decision as they cast their ballots. 
"I don't think that's important," said Karen Lamb, 49, who voted for Mr. Romney because of his business experience. "We need a leader, an economic leader, and he has the right leadership capabilities. We're in a mess."
Some people might be bothered that Mr. Romney grew up in Michigan but did not support the federal bailout of the auto industry in 2008, said Dale Gerard, 51, who also voted for Mr. Romney. "If anything, it might have hurt him," he said. 
About 30 minutes north of Detroit, the township of Bloomfield Hills and its surrounding suburbs are expected to be strong areas for Mr. Romney, who despite his home-state credentials is in a tight race here with Rick Santorum.
Even in Mr. Romney's old neighborhood, Mr. Romney has his detractors.
Wearing a tie printed with the American flag, Sandy Munro, 62, cast his vote for Mr. Santorum because said he believed that Mr. Santorum was "probably the little more moral of the two."
"I think Romney was the right guy last time around to get the country back on its feet," he said about the 2008 election, adding that he liked Mr. Santorum's views on social issues. "Now what we need is a strong political leader to do something to get us out of the moral slump that we're in."
Others have been turned off by both candidates entirely as they clashed in recent weeks. 
"I'm not involved in all the silly social stuff," said Onjel Benson, 51, who decided to vote for Newt Gingrich because of his experience in Washington. "The Republicans don't like him, that's O.K. with me. The Democrats don't like him, that's O.K. with me. I think he has a plan and he's the smartest one of them."

HEADLINE: Victor in Throttling Case Publishes Guidelines on Taking AT&T to Court

BYLINE: BRIAN X. CHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Matt Spaccarelli, an unemployed student who won a small-claims fight with AT&#038;T over its throttling, or slowing down, of his smartphone, wants to make it easier for anyone whose smartphone was throttled to fight the carrier in court. Over the weekend, he published a Web site containing all the documentation he presented to a judge when he presented his case on Friday and won $850. 

 BODY:
Matt Spaccarelli, an unemployed student who won a small-claims fight with AT&T over its throttling, or slowing down, of his smartphone, wants to make it easier for anyone whose smartphone was throttled to fight the carrier in court. Over the weekend, he published a Web site containing the documentation he presented to a judge on Friday, which helped him win $850.
Mr. Spaccarelli filed the court case in mid-February and went to court with AT&T on Friday in Ventura Superior Court in Simi Valley, Calif. He claimed that AT&T had reduced the Internet transfer speeds of his iPhone to the point where it was so slow that it was unusable - in other words, severely limiting his "unlimited" data plan. The judge ruled in his favor.
On his Web site, www.taporc.com, Mr. Spaccarelli lists the forms a customer needs to go to small-claims court, as well a subpoena document that someone can use to request information from AT&T. He also includes documents describing what he read to the judge, as well as information about data speeds and government policies on networks.
"I don't want people to think this dude just got lucky," said Mr. Spaccarelli, emphasizing the importance of doing all your research before going to court.
Mr. Spaccarelli said he used these materials to help his brother, who has also been throttled by AT&T, file a court case on Monday night. He said he would be an expert witness for his brother, and for anyone who wanted to take AT&T to small-claims court, as long as they paid for his travel expenses.
"I said, 'I'll file it for you because I'm your brother,'" he said. "We'll make it 2-for-2 and do it in L.A. County. Different county with a different judge, same evidence."
AT&T, T-Mobile USA and Verizon each have data throttling policies that they enforce differently on customers with unlimited data plans. They say throttling is necessary to ensure that networks remain speedy and usable for the millions of customers switching from traditional cellphones to data-guzzling smartphones.

HEADLINE: More on 'Moral Hazard'

BYLINE: SHAILA DEWAN


HIGHLIGHT: Readers weigh in on how the term is rising and resonating in the national conversation. 

 BODY:
I had a lot of interesting reader responses to my Sunday article on moral hazard and its history. The concept has to do with what happens when you insulate people from the riskiness of their own actions. In the case of homeowners who can no longer afford their mortgages, moral hazard comes into play when you reduce their debt or their monthly payment. 
A mortgage expert wrote to say that homeowners should simply be asked to pay for the help they receive, perhaps in the form of a share of their profits if their homes increase in value. Another reader wrote of the racial aspect of moral hazard, saying, "Underneath the Katrina discussion, the welfare queen discussion, and others like it, going back to why we don't have universal health care, and why we are so stingy about unemployment benefits, is the attitude (now sotto voce, but in the past explicit) that African-Americans will take advantage of the system."
But only one reader sent in a visual. That was Hal R. Varian, the chief economist at Google (and erstwhile Times contributor), who submitted a graph - also known as a Google ngram - showing the frequency of the use of the term.

HEADLINE: Swap Talks Over Greece Could Test the Market

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Greece's restructuring of its debt could potentially prompt payouts on the country's credit-default swaps, a move that could send shivers through the financial system. 

 BODY:
The financial system could face a test this week as industry officials debate a provision of the Greek bailout.
Greece is preparing to overhaul its bonds next month, a restructuring that could potentially prompt payouts on credit-default swaps, the financial instruments that protect against losses on debt. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association will meet on Thursday to decide whether a certain aspect of the deal will make those payments necessary.
If parties have to make good on the credit-default swaps, the situation could send shivers through the market. An important and long-planned measure that aims to strengthen the derivatives market is not yet in place, raising questions about how the financial system will react if the credit-default swaps have to pay out.
In the financial crisis of 2008, banks feared that their trading partners might not be able to meet such obligations on derivatives and other financial arrangements. The situation set off a chain reaction that paralyzed global markets until governments and central banks provided enormous financial support.
To prevent a similar disaster from happening again, finance ministers in the United States and Europe committed in 2009 to move derivatives like credit-default swaps onto clearinghouses. These organizations, if they work properly, can sharply reduce the chances that a large bank will not make good on such contracts.
But credit swaps that pay out if a European country defaults are not yet centrally cleared. Instead, banks remain largely responsible for making sure the various parties can meet their obligations. While financial firms have taken steps to ensure counterparties can pay, some industry participants say the market would be far stronger if central clearing existed now for the swaps.
John Sprow, chief risk officer at Smith Breeden Associates, a fund management firm, said regulators could have used the relative calm in the markets over the last two years to reduce risks in places like the credit-default swap market. "There's no doubt, that, by having central clearing, you'd mitigate counterparty risk," he said.
A small number of credit-default swaps have moved onto clearinghouses, but not swaps on European sovereign debt, even though they are traded relatively frequently and lie at the heart of the Continent's debt maelstrom.
The reason for the delay in Europe appears to reside with the Financial Services Authority, the British financial regulator. The regulator has yet to approve credit-default swaps on sovereign debt for clearing. The American-based IntercontinentalExchange has said it is in a position to start doing so through a European arm. IntercontinentalExchange started clearing default swaps on Latin American government debt last year after it received approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The British regulator declined to comment.
 Clearinghouses have played a major role in strengthening other parts of the derivatives market, like futures. When executing trades through a clearinghouse, market participants have to back up their deals with adequate collateral in case they suddenly cannot make payments. As a result, when a potentially destabilizing event happens, banks are less likely to panic, because they believe money they are owed on trades will be paid.
With Greece moving toward default, all eyes are on how credit-default swaps will behave. One worry is that they may not pay out, even when bondholders suffer a loss. While the Greek bailout package could force investors to take a 70 percent haircut on the country's bonds, the restructuring was set up as a potentially voluntary exchange, an outcome that would not prompt the credit-default swaps.
But a voluntary exchange looks increasingly unlikely. Greece is preparing to use legal means to force all qualifying bondholders to accept a haircut.
Now, industry officials will have to decide whether the credit-default swaps will pay out.
This week, an undisclosed entity officially asked the International Swaps and Derivatives Association to debate whether a particular feature of the Greek debt exchange could activate the swaps. The association said Tuesday that a committee would consider this question on Thursday.
 One part of the Greek exchange being examined allows the European Central Bank to avoid a haircut on the Greek bonds it holds, even though other creditors take a hit. In effect, the committee has to decide whether this constitutes the type of "subordination" for non-E.C.B. bondholders that would prompt a payout on Greek credit-default swaps. Subordination describes the process of relegating a creditor's claim below that of others.
 Rating agencies have already said that the European Central Bank's move amounts to economic subordination for bondholders. But some lawyers don't think it will cause the default swaps to pay out, since subordination is narrowly defined in the swaps' contracts.
 "I can't see any legal event that would also be a credit event," said Simon Firth, a partner at Linklaters in London. A required payout would most likely happen if a bond issuer actually changed the terms of some existing bonds to make them subordinate, he said, and he added that shielding the central bank from losses did not appear to do this.
 Still, some analysts say they believe that such a move would undermine the credibility of credit-default swaps. "It may result in investors deciding it's just too uncertain to enter into C.D.S.," said Peter Green, a partner with Morrison & Foerster in London.

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
Bending the Tax Code, and Lifting A.I.G.'s Profit | Last week, the American International Group reported a whopping $19.8 billion profit for its fourth quarter. It was a quite a feat for a company that was on its death bed just a little over three years ago, so sick that it needed a huge taxpayer bailout, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in his DealBook column.
But if you dug into the numbers, it quickly became clear that $17.7 billion of that profit was pure fantasy -- a tax benefit, er, gift, from the United States government. The company made only $1.6 billion during the quarter from actual operations. Yet A.I.G. not only has received a tax benefit, it is unlikely to pay a cent of taxes this year, nor by some estimates, for at least a decade.
The tax benefit is notable for more than simply its size. It is the result of a rule that the Treasury unilaterally bent for A.I.G. and several other hobbled companies in 2008 that has largely been overlooked.
This rule-twisting could deprive the government of tens of billions of dollars, assuming the firm remains profitable. The tax dodge, and let's be honest, that is what it is, also will most likely help increase the bonuses of A.I.G.'s employees, some of whom helped create many of the problems that led to its role in the financial crisis.

HEADLINE: Heirloom Tomatoes Coming Soon to the Gowanus Canal

BYLINE: LIZ ROBBINS


HIGHLIGHT: After a long and torturous path, the first Whole Foods Market in Brooklyn is closer to becoming a reality. 

 BODY:
3:12 p.m. | Updated A city board on Tuesday unanimously approved a zoning variance necessary for Whole Foods Market to build its much-delayed store in Gowanus, Brooklyn, clearing the way for what the company and local supporters hope will be an economic stimulus for an underdeveloped area steps from a Superfund site. 
So let the garden grow in Brooklyn. The store, topped by a greenhouse and flanked by a parking lot, could be open as early as next year, the company said. 
The Board of Standards and Appeals voted 5-0, and that vote is final. Opponents of Whole Foods would have to pursue legal avenues to try to stop the store from moving forward. 
"We're really excited to be on to the next step and to join the community," said Michael Sinatra, the store's regional spokesman. "We're thrilled that the B.S.A., in their review process, has given us the vote of approval, much as we've gotten from area residents and the Community Board 6, the borough president and local City Council members." 
 Now, Whole Foods has to obtain the requisite city permits, after which the company said it could break ground as early as April. The company said it hoped to open in early-to-mid-2013. 
Twice over the past year, the board had asked Whole Foods Market to provide more analysis of why it needed the special permit to build a two-story, 52,000-square-foot store on the corner of Third Avenue and Third Street. 
Last year, the state said that Whole Foods had removed the toxic soil and capped the site to specifications that there was no longer contamination on the ground. 
This will be the first Whole Foods store in Brooklyn, and when it opens, the eighth in New York City. The seventh store, on 57th Street and Second Avenue, is set to open this August. 
The center of the opposition, the Gowanus Institute, a group formed by developers, planners and environmental professionals after the Gowanus Canal's Superfund designation in 2010, said that it was "disappointed" by the decision, but that it would not file a legal appeal. 
"It is clear that if built, the retail development will indeed forever alter the essential manufacturing character of the Gowanus neighborhood," the group said in a statement, indicating that a suburban-style supermarket could bring similar developments, threatening "low-income individuals who need affordable places to live and work and businesses that need the protection manufacturing zones in order to survive." 
The city councilwoman representing Gowanus, Sara M. Gonzalez, however, applauded the board's decision to clear the final hurdles for Whole Foods. "This project will bring development and commerce to a large, otherwise unused and stagnant lot in the area," she said in a statement. "Most importantly, Whole Foods will bring a much-needed shopping option to local residents and hundreds of well-paying jobs to my constituents."

HEADLINE: New York Fed Sells Former A.I.G. Assets to Credit Suisse

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The sale effectively signals the end of Maiden Lane II, one of two investment vehicles the Federal Reserve Bank of New York set up to house risky investments the government had acquired from the American International Group. 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Tuesday closed the chapter on another part of the financial crisis, selling mortgage bonds with a face value of about $6 billion to Credit Suisse.
The sale effectively signals the end of Maiden Lane II, one of two investment vehicles the New York Fed set up to house risky investments the government had acquired from the American International Group. 
The sale Tuesday will pay down a $19.5 billion loan from the government backing Maiden Lane II, and will generate about $2.8 billion in proceeds for taxpayers, according to the New York Fed. The regulator did not disclose other details about the sale.
"The completion of the sale of the Maiden Lane II portfolio has resulted in significant gains for the public and marks an important milestone in the wind-down of the extraordinary interventions necessitated by the financial crisis," William C. Dudley, the New York Fed's president, said in a statement.
The New York Fed purchased the securities as part of A.I.G.'s $182 billion government bailout in 2008, creating two investment vehicles named after the street that runs behind the bank's headquarters in lower Manhattan. Maiden Lane II consisted of about $20.5 billion worth of bonds tied to subprime mortgages that had rapidly soured as the housing market collapsed.
A.I.G., sensing that the bonds were poised for a rebound in value, made a $15.7 billion bid for the entire portfolio last year. But the New York Fed rebuffed the offer and instead sought to auction off the investments.
Though it found some acceptable bids last year, the New York Fed tried again last month after receiving an unsolicited bid from Goldman Sachs. Credit Suisse won that auction, buying securities with a face value of about $7 billion. A.I.G. later purchased some Maiden Lane II bonds worth about $2 billion.
The auction on Tuesday was prompted by an unsolicited offer by Morgan Stanley, and drew in Credit Suisse, Barclays Capital, Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch and the Royal Bank of Scotland as other bidders.

HEADLINE: A Record Buyout Turns Sour for Investors

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A $45 billion buyout in 2007 of the Texas utility TXU, later renamed Energy Future Holdings, has turned out poorly for its investors because of declining natural gas prices. 

 BODY:
Struck at the peak of the buyout boom five years ago, the $45 billion acquisition of the Texas energy giant TXU - the biggest leveraged buyout in history - has been a painful investment for its private equity owners.
They did not need Warren E. Buffett to remind them how bad things were.
America's most famous investor, in his annual shareholder letter on Saturday, highlighted his $2 billion wrong-way bet on the bonds of the company, which its new owners have renamed Energy Future Holdings. He called the investment "a big mistake" and said it was at risk of losing all of its value.
 "In tennis parlance, this was a major unforced error," Mr. Buffett wrote.
Mr. Buffett's grim view of his Energy Future Holdings position underscores the troubles facing the Texas utility, which is owned by a group of private equity firms led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, TPG Capital and the buyout arm of Goldman Sachs.
Last week, Energy Future Holdings reported a 2011 loss of $1.9 billion amid record low natural gas prices. Its retail business has lost about 17 percent of its customers over the last three years to cheaper rivals. Worsening the company's weak financial performance is its prodigious debt load of $35 billion, most of which was added to the balance sheet to finance the buyout.
Energy Future Holdings was the biggest of the so-called megabuyouts - huge deals struck during the market boom of 2005 to 2007. After the financial crisis hit, it seemed that these deals were destined for bankruptcy. Instead, most of them - a group that includes Freescale Semiconductor and Caesars Entertainment - have made it through the downturn, though the investment returns on these deals are expected to be modest. A few, like the hospital chain H.C.A., have earned big profits.
Not so with Energy Future Holdings. For now, the $8.3 billion in equity invested in the deal by the private equity owners has been all but wiped out on paper. K.K.R. is holding its Energy Future Holdings investment at 10 cents on the dollar, or down 90 percent, according to its latest securities filing.
Allan Koenig, a spokesman for Energy Future Holdings, defended the company. He said it was operating extremely well across all of its businesses, had increased its employment by 25 percent under private equity ownership, and was hedged against low natural gas prices this year. The company's weak financial performance won't cause any defaults on its debt obligations, he said, because it has restructured its balance sheet so the first maturities on its bonds do not come due until 2014.
Yet a growing chorus of analysts and bond investors is skeptical of Energy Future Holdings' ability to survive under its current debt-heavy capital structure. The company's bonds are trading at deeply distressed levels that suggest a high likelihood of default. Energy Future Holdings bonds due in 2015 recently traded at 28 cents on the dollar, offering a yield of 60 percent.
"If natural gas prices remain low, there is no way this can work in the long run," said Peter J. Thornton, an analyst at KDP Investment Advisors. 
Energy Future Holdings has avoided deeper problems by tapping the hot market for high-yield debt, or junk bonds. With the Federal Reserve signaling low interest rates into 2014, investors are shunning Treasuries and pushing into riskier bonds that pay higher yields.
This has allowed troubled companies like Energy Future Holdings to raise money in the bond market. In recent weeks, the company raised about $1.1 billion in high-yield bonds in part to repay loans that it owed to one of its subsidiaries.
But Mr. Thornton, the KDP analyst, said that repeatedly tapping the bond market to raise new funds was a Band-Aid solution to a larger problem.
"It seems to us that they're effectively borrowing more now to increase cash and be able to pay interest in the future," he said. "That's not a good long-term strategy."
The TXU takeover, which was announced in February 2007, was not supposed to turn out this way. A storied century-old business originally called Texas Power & Light, TXU was one of the most profitable utilities in the country. It operated in the large and deregulated Texas electricity market, with holdings that included the state's biggest power-generation business and largest electricity retailer. And as the economy boomed, demand for electricity rose.
It was such a promising deal that several of Wall Street's largest banks - Lehman Brothers and Citigroup among them - invested alongside K.K.R., TPG and Goldman.
The new owners recruited several Texas power brokers to join Energy Future Holdings and help the heavily regulated utility with government relations. They named as chairman Donald L. Evans, the former commerce secretary under President George W. Bush. James A. Baker III, a senior official in the Reagan and Bush administrations, was named advisory chairman.
While Mr. Evans and Mr. Baker have assisted the company on political and regulatory issues, they have no control over the price of natural gas, which has fallen since the buyout, putting pressure on the price of wholesale electricity.
Natural gas prices dropped to a 10-year low of $2.32 per million British thermal units last month, from about $13 during the summer of 2008, mainly because of an unusually warm winter. Andrew DeVries, an analyst at CreditSights, estimates that natural gas needs to reach a price of at least $6.15 for Energy Future Holdings to break even after its interest payments and other expenses.
Consensus expectations put long-term natural gas prices between $4.50 and $5, according to the futures market and an average of Wall Street analysts estimates as compiled by Bloomberg.
"The low price of natural gas provides a significant challenge for the company," John F. Young, the chief executive of Energy Future Holdings, acknowledged in the company's earnings call last week.
One reason for the plummeting price of natural gas has been the sharp rise in domestic natural gas exploration, which has created more supply. Extracting natural gas from shale, through a controversial process called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has created a drilling boom in the United States.
K.K.R. and TPG have benefited from the shale exploration boom in other areas of their private equity portfolios. K.K.R., for example, has had success investing in so-called shale plays. Beginning in 2009, the company placed two bets on natural gas exploration companies. It has since sold those investments, making billions in profit that offset the paper losses in Energy Future Holdings.
Those profits will not help the owners of Energy Future Holdings bonds, who would normally be among the first in line to recouping their investments in a restructuring. But given the company's dim prospects, even bondholders are worried. Mr. Buffett, the company's most prominent bondholder, said in his annual letter that unless gas prices rose substantially, the company's ability to pay interest on its bonds would soon be exhausted.
"Before the leveraged buyout, this was a highly profitable utility," said James Hempstead, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service. "Five years later, the company finds itself in deep financial distress with an untenable capital structure. The game may not be over just yet, but the prospects don't look so good."

Here are some suggestions for teaching and learning about the 2012 election season, followed by selected New York Times features and Learning Network lesson plans. Bookmark this page: we'll be adding activity ideas and resources as the march to the White House proceeds, and will link from here to all the election resources we publish.Meanwhile, we'd love to hear from you! Please share how you're approaching the election with students in the comment box below.Our Election 2012 UnitWe've designed our Election 2012 Unit to put teenagers front and center of this election. Students become the researchers, speechwriters and strategists of the competing campaign teams, and in the process they look critically at the candidates, issues and tactics used in this election.

Within each of four mini-units, teachers will find warm-up activities, research tasks, final projects, and handouts, and they can add or subtract pieces or further scaffold to fit their individual classes, time frames and curricular demands. Mini-Unit 1: Who are the candidates?
Project: Candidate Profiles Students research one candidate and retool his campaign to appeal to younger voters by creating brochures, slide shows, biographies or Facebook pages or other social media strategies to introduce him. Mini-Unit 2: What are the issues?
Projects: Issue-Based Campaign Materials and Debate Students survey each other on the issues that matter to them, then research one or more of these issues in order to create campaign materials like buttons, advertising, brochures or posters around it. They then debate the issues, either from the candidates' point of view or their own. Mini-Unit 3: How are the candidates trying to win the election?
Projects: Argumentative Essay and Campaign Speech Students critique campaign ads to analyze how the candidates this year are attempting to appeal to voters, then focus on one campaign strategy to write an essay answering the question, "Which candidate is running the better campaign?" They then write campaign speeches for the candidate they have researched. Mini-Unit 4: What Do You Think?
Projects: Student Editorial and Mock Election Students conduct a one-question interview on views about the election so far, then write an editorial in which they tell why they think one of the candidates should be elected. They then use the materials they have created and what they have learned so far to run a mock election. Ten More Ideas for Teaching the Election In addition to our Election Unit, we also have ten more suggestions for how you can teach the election in your classroom. Some of these ideas are incorporated within the unit described above. 1. Create Candidate Profiles Where do the presidential candidates stand on issues? How are they represented and defined in the media, and how accurate are those portrayals? What factors, including personal characteristics like hairstyles and dress as well as campaign theme songs, contribute to the candidates' images? Create a class wiki profiling the presidential candidates. 2. Do Election Math Look at the campaign season through a mathematical lens by following the delegate count, and then use the data to make projections or by examining the role that money plays in politics by investigating whether there is a correlation between campaign donations and poll numbers. Or, using the electoral map, map out various routes to the White House by examining states populations, the number of electoral votes each state has and how many electoral votes a candidate needs to win the presidency. Then determine which combinations of states could yield a victory. Create infographics that effectively tell the story of the election thus far. Also, look into what happens if the Republican convention ends up being brokered. 3. Explore the Art of Political Speechwriting and Delivery Examine a presidential candidate's stump speech, looking specifically at word choice and how it relates to meaning and effectiveness. Then write an original stump speech for a presidential candidate that uses similar oratorical approaches as the presidential candidates themselves use in their stump speeches. Finally, create an interactive version of your speech that provides explanatory annotations about the rhetorical moves you are making and their intended effect. 4. Play Campaign News Games Play campaign bingo or conduct a scavenger hunt by finding particular pieces of campaign news in an online or print edition of the Times. 5. Explore the Issues Choose one issue of interest and examine each of the candidates' stances on the issue. Create an issue booklet or Web site that maps out and describes - and perhaps even compares - each candidate's views, platform and history on this issue. You might even include how, if at all, the candidate has evolved on the issue over time. Additionally, students can work to develop their own position on this issue and write a letter to the editor or create a video that offers their personal take on the topic. 6. Examine Debate Strategies Watch excerpts from the presidential debates, paying particular attention to candidates' rhetorical moves and commonly heard themes or phrases. Then mine the debates for examples of issue- and character-based arguments as well as spin. After analyzing candidates' approaches to debating, discuss which debate moves were the most and least effective. Hold either a mock debate in which students take on the roles of presidential candidates or a mock post-debate "spin room" session, with students playing candidate staffers. During debates, they can take advantage of the "second screen" phenomenon and monitor Facebook, Twitter and other social media to see what viewers are saying in real time. They can also try live-"tweeting" or live-blogging a debate, focusing on key phrases and moments, or pulling together a narrative of Twitter posts using a tool like Storify. 7. Investigate Polling and Projection Data Examine the results of a recent poll or a selection of recent polls, particularly ones that have accompanying graphics. Hunt for trends in the polling data. What trends exist across different groups? What opportunities do these polls point to for each of the candidates? What polling results are surprising? Write letters to the editor, or letters of advice to the political party of presidential candidate of your choice, focusing on the one or two trends in the polling data that you think are the most significant. Alternatively, examine one of Nate Silver's data analyses on his blog, FiveThirtyEight, and then discuss his analysis. On what factors does Mr. Silver base his predictions? Has he been right in the past? 8. Create a Youth Campaign Reflect on your political ideology, your stance on important campaign issues and your political party affiliation. Draw on your political identity and ideology to develop a campaign designed to get teenagers not yet eligible to vote involved in the election. For example, they might get involved in a campaign like "Why Tuesday?" or "#16tovote," or they might participate in a rally or other event. 9. Investigate Young Voters' Role Consider what young voters are saying a selection of opinion pieces written by young people about the upcoming elections and how their level of involvement so far compares with youth involvement in the 2008 election. Then conduct a series of interviews to better understand how young voters in your community are approaching the 2012 race. Create a short documentary that tells the story of how young people in your community are approaching the election. 10. Follow Campaign News Follow news of the presidential campaign on a digital or timeline, Facebook page or Twitter feed over time, and engage in class discussion along the way. Along with adding breaking news, add weekly photographs to your feed to help tell the story of the campaign and provide material for analysis. Fact-check statements made by politicians on the class page whenever they hear something questionable. On Twitter, they can use the hashtag #asknyt to submit candidate comments made during debates that they think merit some scrutiny. Teaching Resources The Politics section includes, along with daily news stories, the political news blog The Caucus and the data analysis blog FiveThirtyEight, as well as candidate profiles, primary results by state, political polls and more.Visit the politics video channel for videos that capture specific elements of the campaign in footage and explanation.The Learning Network's civics section contains lesson plans pertaining to the presidency and government, including numerous activities related to past elections as well as the current election season.In addition, you can read about our list of free Web sites for teaching the election.Selected lesson plans and other resources are below. 2012 Election: Lesson Plans Ways to Engage: Election NightTeaching the Election in the Final Week: Bellwethers, Unicorns and Attack AdsReader Idea | Students Create Video Ads for Historical Presidential ElectionsIdeas for Addressing Mormonism in the ClassroomTeaching With the Presidential DebatesMatters of the Latter Day: Ideas for Addressing Mormonism in the ClassroomIdeas for English Language Learners | Election 2012Follow the Money: Understanding 'Super PAC' Spending in PoliticsThe United States of Numeracy: The Math of a Presidential CampaignThe Vice President as a Teenager: A Lesson  la 'Saturday Night Live'On the Stump: Examining the Form and Function of Campaign SpeechesCharacter vs. Characterization: Examining How Candidates and Politicians Are DefinedFirst Contest of the Year: Following the Iowa Caucuses10 Ways to Teach About Election Day The 2012 Election: Other Resources Student Opinion Question | Who Do You Hope Wins the Election?6 Q's About the News | Voter ID Laws and Election 2012Our Student Opinion Questions: "What Is Your Reaction to the First Presidential Debate?" thesecond presidential debate and the third?

HEADLINE: Memo to Mitt Romney: We Get It. You're Rich.

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: The presidential aspirant can't seem to stop reminding voters of his considerable wealth. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney doesn't like it when his rivals mention his considerable personal wealth. Way back (like two months ago) in New Hampshire, he castigated Newt Gingrich for reminding voters about his career in the leveraged-buyout business. Mr. Romney called that class warfare.
I don't blame Mr. Romney for his defensiveness. Wealth is not the best selling point for a political candidate during a slow, painful recovery from a deep, painful recession - especially at a time when income inequality has reached absurd proportions. But that raises the question: Why does Mr. Romney keep telling us how rich he is?

At a debate in Iowa, Mr. Romney challenged Rick Perry (remember him?) to a $10,000 bet. I guess it didn't occur to Mr. Romney that 10K is high stakes for the average voter.
Before the New Hampshire primary he said "I like being able to fire people." Granted, this was in the context of a conversation about insurance companies, not his time at Bain. But it was a tin-eared remark nonetheless. Besides, most of us don't have the power to fire the insurance companies that our employers have selected on our behalf.
Last Friday in Michigan, while babbling about the virtues of American automobiles, he said, "My wife drives a couple of Cadillacs."
That should sew up the more-than-one-luxury-car-per-person vote.
Most recently, there was his cringe-inducing appearance at the Daytona Speedway. Mr. Romney wandered through the Nascar crowd like an anthropologist in a pith helmet observing the natives. He was trying to be Just Plain Joe, but he ended up being Just Plain Thurston Howell III. "I like those fancy raincoats you bought," he said to a group of fans wearing plastic ponchos. "Really sprung for the big bucks."
Not content with just one lame attempt at levity, Mr. Romney also recalled driving "a little fast" as a youth near his Michigan home. That would be Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, one of the wealthiest small towns in America.
When asked if he was a stock-car racing fan, Mr. Romney said, "I have some great friends who are Nascar team owners."
It's hard to know why Mr. Romney has this tic. Asked about it on Fox News, Mr. Romney said, "I just am who I am." That's a rather strange remark, coming from Mr. Romney, who's generally content to be whoever Republican primary voters want him to be.
Mr. Romney added, rather defensively: "If people think that there is something wrong with being successful in American, then they better vote for the other guy."
There is indeed nothing wrong with success. But a guy who wants to be president probably shouldn't make a habit of flaunting it.

HEADLINE: Putin Offers to Save Europe From Decline and Irrelevance

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Ahead of Sunday's first round of Russian elections, Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian prime minister, lambasted Western leaders in a foreign policy review. But he also tempted Europe to accept Russia's embrace in a Union of Europe that would stretch from "Lisbon to Vladivostok". 

 BODY:
LONDON - If Vladimir V. Putin, as he claims, seeks a closer relationship with the rest of Europe, he is going about achieving it in a funny way.
The Russian prime minister, apparently headed for a return to the presidency according to polls ahead of the first round of elections scheduled for Sunday, has done little to endear himself to his country's western neighbors during the campaign.
Aside from highlighting deep divisions over Syria and Iran, Mr. Putin has been taking pot shots at European energy policy and attacking European governments for failing to lift visa requirements on Russians. Nearer to home, his government appears to be gearing up for a new "gas war" with Ukraine.
Odd timing, then, to come up with a vision for a Union of Europe - not to be confused with the 27-member European Union - that would stretch from "Lisbon to Vladivostok."
The idea figured in a lengthy peroration on foreign policy that Mr. Putin published on Monday. It portrayed the rest of Europe - once "an oasis of stability and order" - as an economic basket case whose problems could not but affect Russia's interests.
With the tone of a distant if kindly uncle, Mr Putin wrote: "We are by no means indifferent to developments in united Europe." Russia was already involved in international efforts to support Europe's ailing economies, and was "not opposed in principle to direct financial assistance in some cases."
The concept of a Union of Europe, a phrase Mr. Putin ascribed to Russian experts, was not a new one. Nor was its objective: a strengthened alliance with the rest of Europe that would reinforce Russia's position between the United States and the emerging powers of Asia.
Sergei Karaganov, a political analyst and former deputy director of European studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences, wrote in 2010 under the title: "A Union of Europe: The Last Chance?":
"If Europe does not unite, it will be the U.S. and China that will call the tune in the future world, and the brilliant half-millennium of Europe will be over."
Igor Yurgens, an adviser to Dmitri A. Medvedev, the outgoing president, made a similar argument back in 2008 when he wrote: "If isolated from one another, and of course in a climate of rivalry between Russia and Europe, neither will be able to claim a role of a first-class center of strength in the future world order comparable with the U.S. or China, instead becoming objects of politics of external forces."
There's little indication that Europe's present leaders want to jump aboard Mr. Putin's Union of Europe bandwagon. Like their historic predecessors, they are reluctant to be embraced by the Russian bear. As Mr. Putin's warnings about Europe's energy policies indicate, Russia can prove a coercive suitor.
Catherine Ashton, the European Union's High Representative for foreign affairs, is among those not so easily wooed. In a speech this month, she decried another job swap between the Russian president and prime minister that "made many Russian citizens feel that things were being decided between only two men, over the heads of voters."
If anyone needed help, it was not Europe but Russia itself, she suggested. "We will continue our support to modernize both Russia's economic basis and the foundations for a dynamic society oriented towards the future," she said.

HEADLINE: Prominent Democrat Endorses Third-Party Group

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: David Boren, a former Democratic senator and governor from Oklahoma who backed President Obama in 2008, is endorsing Americans Elect to provide "electric shock therapy" to the political system. 

 BODY:
Even as Republicans wage a bitter, intra-party feud for the right to challenge President Obama, a group called Americans Elect is steadily building support - and a 50-state infrastructure - for a bipartisan ticket that could challenge both parties for the White House.
That effort will get a fresh push on Tuesday from David Boren, a former Democratic senator and governor from Oklahoma who backed Mr. Obama in 2008 but says he is now looking for a way to provide "electric shock therapy" to the political system.
"The country is going to really be in deep trouble if we don't act soon," Mr. Boren, who is now president of the University of Oklahoma, said in an interview with The Caucus. "I think this is really a cry from many of us who are really concerned for the future of the country."
Mr. Boren is part of a small, but growing cadre of politicians from both sides of the aisle who are expressing displeasure with the political system - and the political gridlock it is producing. Just last week, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah and candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, voiced support for a third party, saying that the two-party system was broken. 
The negative and personal character attacks being flung by the Republican presidential candidates is adding to Mr. Boren's outrage at the process. On Tuesday, he will announce that he is endorsing the Americans Elect effort.
Asnoted earlier by Richard W. Stevenson in The New York Times, the Americans Elect group is planning to nominate a bipartisan ticket -- a presidential candidate from one party and a vice-presidential running mate from
another -- in the hopes of returning to an era when the two parties worked effectively together.
An online process will choose six finalists in May, each of whom will pick a running mate from another party. And then online voting will conclude in June with a two-person ticket that organizers say will be on the ballot in all 50 states in November.
Officials at the group said Monday that they had collected 2.4 million signatures and have ensured a place on the ballot in 16 states, including California. They have finished collecting signatures in another 13 states and say they are confident in their success. Mr. Boren's comments on Tuesday will come as the group presents its signatures to get on the ballot in his home state of Oklahoma.
But logistical concerns are only part of the battle. To have an impact, the Americans Elect effort must earn the respect and the blessings of big-name, establishment figures in both parties who are willing to risk the ire of their friends and colleagues by considering the possibility of a third ticket.
Mr. Boren took pains to say that his endorsement of Americans Elect does not mean that he necessarily will support the group's presidential ticket.
"If Americans Elect produces a ticket that is not well qualified, that I don't think has the strength to bring the country together, it's certainly possible that I would support President Obama's re-election," Mr. Boren said.
But that sentiment alone is likely to be seen as a blunt message by Mr. Obama's re-election team in Chicago.
Mr. Boren served as a Democratic governor in the late 1970s and then was a Democratic senator from 1979 to 1994. He currently serves as the co-chair of Mr. Obama's Intelligence Advisory Board. He praised Mr. Obama's national security successes and said that his endorsement of the Americans Elect group is not meant as a criticism of the president.
But at the same time, he said he no longer had any confidence that electing either a Democratic or Republican ticket would restore the sense of political comity that prevailed during much of his time in the Senate.
"What we have really seen is the inability of either party to reach across the aisle as we used to and reach a meeting of the minds," he said. "The most important ability the next president must have is to really bring the two parties together and make the two-party system work again in a way that it did 20 or 25 years ago."
There is deep suspicion among Republican and Democratic strategists that the Americans Elect effort is secretly aimed at helping one party or the other.
Mr. Boren said his friends in both parties had whispered to him their conspiracy theories. Republicans tell him the group is part of a plot to re-elect Mr. Obama. Democrats tell him they believe it's a front group to put a Republican in the White House next year.
"It's neither," he said, adding that he found interesting the "knee-jerk" reactions from both sides.
Mr. Boren said he had no interest in being on a ticket himself. And he declined to offer names of some people he said he knew to be considering running under the group's banner in the fall. But, he said, "I would be surprised if we did not have people who would be viewed as highly experienced."
"There are some very serious people thinking about entering the race through this process," he said.
Among the people who are often mentioned is Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire mayor of New York who dropped his Republican affiliation several years ago to become an independent. Mr. Bloomberg and his aides have long played coy about the possibility of a presidential run.
Others already involved in the group or mentioned as possible candidates include Christine Todd Whitman, a moderate Republican who served as governor of New Jersey, and Erskine Bowles, who served as White House chief of staff under Bill Clinton and was the president of the University of North Carolina for five years.
Buddy Roemer, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination, announced this month that he would seek to lead the Americans Elect ticket this year.
The group says that more than 2.6 million people have visited its Web site and that about 380,000 people have signed up to be "delegates" to the online convention that will pick the presidential ticket in June. The group has 460,000 Facebook fans.
Mr. Boren said that his discussions with the organizers of Americans Elect suggested that they shared a desire for a ticket that would embrace long-term fiscal reform, seek to pass a constitutional amendment to bar corporate contributions to politicians and appoint a bipartisan cabinet once elected.
But he conceded that the online community could choose a different kind of ticket that he would be unable to support.
"It could happen, and if it does, it wouldn't be something that I support," Mr. Boren said.
But he said that even if the Americans Elect ticket failed to win in November, the impact on the two major parties could be impressive. He said the mere presence of a third option for voters might encourage the creation of a bipartisan caucus in the Congress and a new willingness to work together.
"The American people have been saying, 'We wish we had a third choice, we wish we had a third way,'" Mr. Boren said. The question is, he added, "Are they really going to vote that way?"

HEADLINE: After Michigan and Arizona? More Angst

BYLINE: FRANK BRUNI


HIGHLIGHT: Even if Tuesday goes largely Romney's way, he'll be dogged by the sense that he still hasn't truly proven that he can engender enthusiasm where it doesn't naturally exist and where he doesn't enjoy a particular advantage. 

 BODY:
Cruising the Internet for campaign updates last weekend, I stumbled across this headline on the Politico web site, which wasn't the only one to trumpet the, um, news: "Daniels says he's a no."
At long last, clarity! Because the previous 27 times that Mitch Daniels, the governor of Indiana, had said he wouldn't jump into the presidential fray didn't really count. On one of those occasions, after all, he had crossed his heart but hadn't hoped to die. On another, he seemed to wink, or at least subsequent forensic analysis of video footage of the moment suggested that possibility. And on none of them had the Republican Party's situation devolved to so desperate a point.
So Republicans were still wishing. And reporters were still asking. 
And the results today from Michigan and Arizona are unlikely to put an end to that, no matter what they are.
Let's say Rick Santorum wins Michigan, if only by a percentage point. The panic already gripping the Republican Party will deepen and spread, because Santorum's chance to actually seize the nomination will look more plausible than ever. But he remains the longest of long shots to beat President Obama down the line. An economic calamity might get him there, because an economic calamity might get any Republican nominee there, but barring that? He's a potent turnoff to swing voters, who find many of his stances on social issues archaic and mean, for the simple reason that they are. And to moderate Republicans, he's an embarrassment. So they will keep fantasizing-and reporters will keep hypothesizing-about some last-minute intervention or convention hijinks to save the party from his potentially devastating impact on it.
Let's say Romney wins Michigan, and does it by four or five points. It will be said-rightly-that that's no better a result than he should always have been able to manage. Michigan, after all, is as close to a home state as he has. He went to high school there, and his father was once its popular governor. What's more, he won the state's Republican primary in 2008 by nine percentage points over John McCain. He can't do as well four years later?
Even if Tuesday goes largely Romney's way, he'll be dogged by the sense that he still hasn't truly proven that he can engender enthusiasm where it doesn't naturally exist and where he doesn't enjoy a particular advantage.
A victory in Arizona, like his victory in Nevada, would in small measure reflect-and to a certain degree be interpreted in terms of-a pronounced Mormon presence in the state. As the New York Times's Nate Silver noted in a recent post his FiveThirtyEight blog:
In the 2008 primary there, Mormon voters constituted 11 percent of the electorate - and Romney won 88 percent of their votes, versus 8 percent for John McCain.
If Romney posts similar numbers among Mormon voters this year in Tuesday's primary - and there's no reason to think that he won't - that works out a nine-point built-in advantage in the state. 
Indeed, most of his victories in the primaries so far have prosaic explanations other than the sheer hubba-hubba of his appeal. New Hampshire? It's something of a home state, too: he has a house there. Florida? He outspent Newt Gingrich five to one, unleashing a merciless barrage of attack ads. 
Michigan and Arizona victories wouldn't end the sense that Romney hasn't yet closed the deal. Questions would endure, as would many Republicans' disappointment in the awkwardness of his candidacy and their worry, based on what they've seen so far this year, that he'd bumble and misspeak his way into certain defeat by Obama.
The run-up to Michigan wasn't exactly reassuring. There was the "couple of Cadillacs" comment. There was the remark about not knowing much about the sport of NASCAR but having "some great friends that are NASCAR team owners."
In law they talk about "excited utterances," which are exceptions to the hearsay prohibition. Romney is bedeviled by "affluent utterances," which threaten to become nails in the coffin of his candidacy. Despite all the grief they cause, he can't stop making asides that are big bay windows into his remarkable riches. And that's not the best view to give voters at this particular moment in the American story, when joblessness remains high, the rebound from a slump remains tentative and there's more discussion than in a very long time about disparities in wealth and inequities in the tax code.
So tomorrow and later this week and possibly into next, when Super Tuesday does or doesn't start to settle what's left unsettled after Michigan, there will be stubborn dreams of Daniels. And persistent mirages of Chris Christie. And prayers said for help from Jeb Bush, who just six months ago was thought to have too much of a whiff of dynasty around him and to be too soon a reminder of a presidency that disappointed so many.
In the context of the current Republican field, he's suddenly an electoral ideal, a knight in shining Kennebunkport corduroys. That's where we're at.

HEADLINE: Without Reference to 'Snobs' or 'Indoctrination,' Santorum Supported College Access in 2006

BYLINE: TANYA CALDWELL


HIGHLIGHT: When running for Senate in 2006, Rick Santorum called for every Pennsylvanian to have access to higher education. 

 BODY:
It seems that Rick Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania who faces tough Republican primary battles Tuesday in Michigan and Arizona, shared some of President Obama's higher-education goals -- at least in 2006.
Mr. Santorum was speaking to a Tea Party group in Michigan on Saturday when he called Mr. Obama a "snob" for supporting higher education for all Americans.
But when he was running for the United States Senate in 2006, Mr. Santorum wanted all Pennsylvanians to go to college, according to Talking Points Memo, which posted a screen shot of the candidate's "commitment to higher education" from his 2006 campaign Web site.
"In addition to Rick's support of ensuring that primary and secondary schools in Pennsylvania are equipped for success, he is equally committed to ensuring (that) every Pennsylvanian has access to higher education," the site reads. "Rick Santorum has supported legislative solutions that provide loans, grants and tax incentives to make higher education more accessible and affordable."
The campaign site's use of the word "access" appears consistent with Mr. Obama's "Education Blueprint for an Economy Built to Last," which states that the United States is being outpaced internationally and suffers from a domestic "college attainment gap," and cites higher education as a "prerequisite for the growing jobs of the new economy."
As part of his continued focus on education, President Obama has presented an agenda that will ensure that America's students and workers receive the education and training needed for the jobs of today and tomorrow. The president's plan reflects a commitment to keeping the American promise alive by advancing educational opportunity that will lead to good jobs that pay well and provide greater security for the middle class.
Regaining America's global leadership in higher education attainment requires robust participation and effort to meet this goal from all colleges and universities - public and private, two-year and four-year, across all states and territories.
Mr. Obama has also called on all Americans to obtain at least one year of higher education or career training, whether at a community college, a four-year school, an apprenticeship or vocational training.
Last week, Mr. Santorum called Mr. Obama's higher-education goals a way to get people into "indoctrination mills" led by liberal professors. But a former professor of Mr. Santorum's told The New Republic that the candidate (who went to college and has three degrees) was never at a disadvantage for having conservative views.
The Choice has reached out to Mr. Santorum's campaign for comment, and will update this post if we receive a response.
Meanwhile, Mr. Obama rejected the indoctrination charge in remarks to the nation's governors at the White House on Monday.
"When I speak about higher education, we are not just talking about a four-year degree," he said. "We are talking about somebody going to a community college and getting trained for that manufacturing job that now is requiring someone walking through the door handling a million-dollar piece of equipment. And they can't go in there unless they have some basic training beyond what they received in high school."
Mr. Santorum's campaign seemed to back away from the "snob" comment on Monday, Michael D. Shear reported in The Caucus, The Times' political news blog.
Alice Stewart, the spokeswoman, said she was encouraged by Mr. Obama's encouragement of trade or vocational schools. 
"We're glad that the president clarified that after Rick pointed that out," Ms. Stewart said on MSNBC. "That's exactly what Rick was saying."

HEADLINE: To Autoworkers, Obama Turns Up Oratory

BYLINE: HELENE COOPER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama was in full campaign mode and resembled his 2008 self in a rousing speech at a United Auto Workers conference in Washington. 

 BODY:
In case there are any Michigan voters who haven't heard, President Obama had this message on Tuesday morning as the state's primary got underway: three years ago, he helped save the auto industry with a controversial bailout.
Mr. Obama highlighted this decision during a rousing speech to the United Auto Workers conference in Washington. The president was in full campaign mode, resembled his 2008 self, throughout his address, which was conveniently timed as Michigan voters were headed to the polls.
"Just a few years ago, nearly one in five autoworkers were handed a pink slip," Mr. Obama said. "And as the financial crisis hit with its full fury, America faced a hard and once unimaginable reality: two of the Big Three - G.M. and Chrysler - were on the brink of failure."
And then, he got to the punch-line that he has been perfecting ever since the Republican campaign road-show headed to Michigan, where Mitt Romney has been trying to live down an Op-Ed piece he wrote in The New York Times in 2008 headlined "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt."
Mr. Obama has been gleefully bringing that up at just about every public event. His speech Tuesday, before a raucous crowd of the Democratic Party's labor base, gave him the ultimate platform. "Some politicians," Mr. Obama said, "even said we should 'let Detroit go bankrupt!'"
The crowd booed. Mr. Obama paused, dramatically.
"You remember that?" he said.
More boos.
Another pause, then Mr. Obama started grinning, clearly enjoying himself. "Think about what that choice would have meant for this country, if we had turned our backs on you, if America had thrown in the towel. G.M. and Chrysler wouldn't exist today."
Mr. Obama, when he chooses to and as he did consistently in 2008 during his run for president, can turn up the oratory. The crowd of autoworkers and labor leaders were eating up every word - and their energy appeared to further amp up Mr. Obama. The president fed them one line after another, and several times detoured from his prepared remarks, like when he gave an endorsement for the new Chevy Volt that included a promise to buy one - in five years time, of course.
"I got to sit in a Chevy Volt, even though Secret Service wouldn't let me drive it," Mr. Obama said, to cheers. "I enjoyed sitting in it. And four or five years from now when I'm not president no more and I can drive myself, I'm gonna buy one."
From the crowd came the chant every president likes to hear: "Four more years! Four more years!" Mr. Obama broke into another beaming smile.
It was with that smile still stretched across his face that he - again - went after Mr. Romney, although never mentioning him by name. "It's been fun watching these folks trying to completely rewrite history now that you're back on your feet," he told the autoworkers.
He went into a long riff about the hard labors of union workers, and sought to turn Republican rhetoric about American values against the party. "Let me tell you, I keep hearing people talk about values all the time," Mr. Obama said, his voice rising. "Hard work, that's a value."
Mr. Obama even channeled Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who died in 2009. "He used to say, 'What is it about working men and women they find so offensive?'"
Mr. Obama's campaign advisers had been enjoying Rick Santorum's rise in the polls in Michigan, and say that even as Mr. Romney has surged back in that state - the state he grew up in - they have gleaned important tips for the general election. At the top of that list, they say, will be looking for more ways to beat up Mr. Romney for writing that Op-Ed in 2008.
Not surprisingly, Republicans were quick to respond Tuesday.
"President Obama is known for putting his re-election over keeping his promises to the American people," said Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman with the Republican National Committee. "Obama's speech to U.A.W. today is no different. This is an insider deal for his union cronies who got billions in bailout money and are now backing Obama's re-election campaign."

HEADLINE: Putin Offers to Save Europe From Decline and Irrelevance

BYLINE: THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE


HIGHLIGHT: Ahead of Sunday's first round of Russian elections, Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian prime minister, lambasted Western leaders in a foreign policy review. But he also tempted Europe to accept Russia's embrace in a Union of Europe that would stretch from "Lisbon to Vladivostok". 

 BODY:
LONDON - If Vladimir V. Putin, as he claims, seeks a closer relationship with the rest of Europe, he is going about achieving it in a funny way.
The Russian prime minister, apparently headed for a return to the presidency according to polls ahead of the first round of elections scheduled for Sunday, has done little to endear himself to his country's western neighbors during the campaign.
Aside from highlighting deep divisions over Syria and Iran, Mr. Putin has been taking pot shots at European energy policy and attacking European governments for failing to lift visa requirements on Russians. Nearer to home, his government appears to be gearing up for a new "gas war" with Ukraine.
Odd timing, then, to come up with a vision for a Union of Europe - not to be confused with the 27-member European Union - that would stretch from "Lisbon to Vladivostok."
The idea figured in a lengthy peroration on foreign policy that Mr. Putin published on Monday. It portrayed the rest of Europe - once "an oasis of stability and order" - as an economic basket case whose problems could not but affect Russia's interests.
With the tone of a distant if kindly uncle, Mr Putin wrote: "We are by no means indifferent to developments in united Europe." Russia was already involved in international efforts to support Europe's ailing economies, and was "not opposed in principle to direct financial assistance in some cases."
The concept of a Union of Europe, a phrase Mr. Putin ascribed to Russian experts, was not a new one. Nor was its objective: a strengthened alliance with the rest of Europe that would reinforce Russia's position between the United States and the emerging powers of Asia.
Sergei Karaganov, a political analyst and former deputy director of European studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences, wrote in 2010 under the title: "A Union of Europe: The Last Chance?":
"If Europe does not unite, it will be the U.S. and China that will call the tune in the future world, and the brilliant half-millennium of Europe will be over."
Igor Yurgens, an adviser to Dmitri A. Medvedev, the outgoing president, made a similar argument back in 2008 when he wrote: "If isolated from one another, and of course in a climate of rivalry between Russia and Europe, neither will be able to claim a role of a first-class center of strength in the future world order comparable with the U.S. or China, instead becoming objects of politics of external forces."
There's little indication that Europe's present leaders want to jump aboard Mr. Putin's Union of Europe bandwagon. Like their historic predecessors, they are reluctant to be embraced by the Russian bear. As Mr. Putin's warnings about Europe's energy policies indicate, Russia can prove a coercive suitor.
Catherine Ashton, the European Union's High Representative for foreign affairs, is among those not so easily wooed. In a speech this month, she decried another job swap between the Russian president and prime minister that "made many Russian citizens feel that things were being decided between only two men, over the heads of voters."
If anyone needed help, it was not Europe but Russia itself, she suggested. "We will continue our support to modernize both Russia's economic basis and the foundations for a dynamic society oriented towards the future," she said.

HEADLINE: For Companies, Tax Code Adds to Debt's Appeal

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: While the president's review of corporate taxation looked at the tax advantages of debt, it had no proposals to change the situation, probably because that would cause uncertainty and complications. 

 BODY:
Corporate America's love affair with debt is driven by a heavy subsidy, courtesy of the federal tax code. It's an unhealthy preference that the Obama administration is now reviewing.
The problem arises because the interest that corporations pay on their debt is deductible on their federal taxes.
To understand the effect of this deduction, imagine if you could deduct the interest you pay on your debt. I am not just talking about the deduction on your home mortgage. This would be a deduction for all of the interest paid on your credit card bills, auto loans and any other loans you had, including the one from Uncle Mikey.
What would be the effect? First, you would have more money in your pocket. That 10- or 15-something percent interest rate on your credit card would be effectively reduced by up to a third, depending upon your tax rate.
But because debt is now cheaper, you may be more likely to borrow to make purchases rather than purchase items outright. If so, you would end up taking on more aggregate debt and saving less. Before the 1986 tax overhaul, credit card interest could in fact be deducted. Congress eliminated this loophole, in part, because members thought it encouraged just this sort of behavior.
This is what is occurring in corporate America. Companies can finance investment from either debt or equity. But profit on an investment financed with equity - stock issued by the company - is taxed. In contrast, if the project is financed with debt, then only the profit after interest payments are made is taxed. This means debt-financed investments are cheaper than equity.
This creates a bias by corporations toward debt.
The big winners are capital-intensive industries that rely heavily on debt to finance their operations, like utilities and manufacturers. But companies owned by private equity firms also benefit substantially since they borrow substantial amounts of cash in buyouts.
The debt bias is even greater when you take into account the tax deduction for rapid depreciation of investment. The Treasury estimates that corporations pay an effective marginal tax rate of 37 percent, allowing for depreciation, when they issue stock to invest in goods and equipment. In contrast, if a company finances the purchase with debt, the effective marginal tax rate is minus 60 percent when the effect of accelerated depreciation is taken into account. This means that for every $100 of debt taken on and invested, the effective tax deduction is $160. But for equity, the company and its investors pay $37.
Compare this with tax-friendly Ireland, where the effective marginal tax rate is 15 percent for an equity investment in equipment, but minus 4 percent when the investment is financed with debt. Or Japan, where the tax rate rises to 49 percent for equity and is also minus 4 percent for debt financing.
Some complain that the base tax rate of 35 percent in the United States is too high. But in the case of debt and depreciation, the United States is a world leader. The United States tax subsidy for debt when depreciation is taken into account is almost triple the average for the Group of 7 and other developed countries.
While overall United States corporate debt levels have fallen over the years, it is not hard to conclude that the tax code is creating incentives for companies to take on more debt than they otherwise would. The extra debt can lead to higher bankruptcy rates, higher administration costs and excessive risk-taking. Too much debt can make recessions last longer as companies struggle to shake off their burden.
When President Obama announced his proposal on the corporate tax code, much of the attention was on the suggested reduction in the corporate tax rate, to 28 percent from 35 percent.
But Mr. Obama's proposal also recognized that "outsized reliance on debt financing can increase the risk of financial distress and thus raise the likelihood of bankruptcy." But the proposal does not address whether to eliminate the interest tax deduction.
Wouldn't that be the simple answer to the problem?
Nothing is ever simple in taxes, alas. Eliminating the interest tax deduction may reduce investment, and result in country arbitrage as companies shift debt and equity to offshore subsidiaries with more favorable tax regimes.
A report last year from the International Monetary Fundsuggested that the debt bias be eliminated by allowing companies to have an equivalent deduction for equity. But giving a tax deduction for equity would only make things more complex because companies would then argue over how equity should be valued for the deduction. And overall corporate tax rates would probably have to rise to account for this adjustment.
The International Monetary Fund's recommendation was in line with that of a bipartisan panel established by President George W. Bush in 2005, which proposed putting debt and equity on equal footing for tax purposes.
The fund's report also examined why the debt tax deduction might be appropriate. Banks are generally less willing to lend to corporations because they have insufficient information about them. A debt tax deduction can make borrowing easier for companies.
Moreover, there are reasons to allow corporations, but not people, to deduct debt. The tax deduction on debt comes about because corporations are taxed only on their earnings. The interest paid is subtracted from their earnings. Corporations are not using this debt to finance their day-to-day operations as people might; this is debt taken on to make investments.
It is the uncertainty and complications surrounding an elimination of the debt tax deduction that probably kept the Obama administration from proposing a solution. No doubt, the administration is also positioning itself for hard bargaining ahead. And realistically the chance of any tax overhaul's occurring before the election is about the same as that of an outbreak of world peace.
The president did hint at which course he prefers, however. The report focused on how the United States is oversubsidizing debt compared with other nations, establishing a case for cutting back the debt deduction to put it on parity with those of other countries. This option was also laid out by his Economic Recovery Advisory Board in its 2010 report on tax reform. In that case, only a portion of debt would be tax deductible rather than all of it.
This seems a sensible place to start, reducing the huge subsidy for debt to bring the United States more in line with other nations. This is one area of the global economy where the United States may be too competitive. Subsidizing corporate debt is just too risky.

HEADLINE: Live Blogging Michigan and Arizona Primaries

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The Times is providing live updates and analysis from the Republican primaries in Michigan and Arizona. 

 BODY:
The race for the Republican presidential nomination is not likely to be settled on Tuesday, though much is at stake for Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum as voters in Michigan and Arizona head to the polls. The race in Michigan remains tight and its delegates are likely to be split between the two main rivals, but the state is an important one for Mr. Romney, who was born and raised there, and won it convincingly in 2008. It also offers Mr. Santorum - and skeptical conservatives - the best chance yet to turn nagging questions about Mr. Romney into deep doubts about his candidacy. 
Arizona is a different story. Mr. Romney has been building support in the state for months, aided by an endorsement from Senator John McCain and the state's significant Mormon population, which voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Romney in 2008. Though Mr. Santorum made an aggressive push there last week, late polling suggests its 29 delegates are out of his reach.

6:57 P.M. | Exit Polls: Evangelicals and Catholics
The evangelical Christian vote has been somewhat all over the map in this year's nominating contests. Exit poll results showed Mr. Romney winning white evangelical voters in Nevada, Mr. Gingrich winning them in South Carolina, and the evangelical vote dividing between Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich in Florida. Earlier, in Iowa, Rick Santorum won a plurality of white evangelicals.
(There were no exit or entrance polls in the Colorado, Missouri, Minnesota contests that Mr. Santorum swept earlier this month.) 
Intensifying his pursuit of socially conservative voters in recent days, Mr. Santorum, who is Catholic, defended the role of religion in public life this weekend, dismissing John F. Kennedy's call for the separation of religion and politics, and saying that college campuses in America are not a "neutral setting" for people of faith.
In Michigan, nearly 4 in 10 primary voters are white Christian evangelicals, according to early exit poll results, and about 3 in 10 are Catholic.
Catholic voters made up at least about third of voters in both New Hampshire and Florida - and in both of those states, they swung for Mr. Romney.
But only about 1 in 7 voters in Michigan said that abortion mattered most to their vote today. Even among social conservatives, the economy was the No. 1 issue - nearly half of white evangelical voters said the economy mattered most to their decision, with nearly a quarter saying either abortion or the deficit mattered the most.

6:32 P.M. | Romney Looks to Win Conservative Voters
When Mr. Romney won Nevada's caucus on the heels of another victory in Florida, his campaign argued that he had finally made inroads with voters who call themselves very conservative.
In fact, in Nevada, Mr. Romney finally won that category, capturing 46 percent of the "very conservative" vote, while Mr. Gingrich only took 25 percent and Mr. Santorum (who did not campaign much there) took 15 percent.
But was that a fluke? Many of those who said they were very conservative also were Mormons, a group much more inclined to vote for Mr. Romney, who is a Mormon.
And a few days later, Mr. Romney got walloped in Colorado, Missouri and Minnesota. Exit and entrance polling was not available, but Mr. Santorum's campaign claimed credit for scoring big among the most conservative voters in those states.
Now, watching how those voters cast their ballots in Michigan and Arizona will be very interesting.
In Michigan, Mr. Santorum should have an edge. He has been talking at length about social issues, speaking in the kind of language that helps to fire up the Tea Party and evangelical bases of the Republican Party.
Arizona might be a bit different. The candidates have spent less time there, and immigration is a bigger deal in the border state. How does that cut for very conservative voters? That's unclear. Mr. Romney has tacked sharply to the right on the issue of illegal immigration, but Mr. Santorum is no liberal on the issue either.
The results of the "very conservative" block are probably of greater importance for Mr. Romney, who still faces questions about his ability to excite that kind of voter. If he improves tonight, that will help his campaign going forward.

6:22 P.M. | Exit Polls: Enthusiasm Gap in Arizona
An indicator of the lack of enthusiasm for the candidates on the ballot, half of Republican primary voters in Arizona said they strongly favored the candidate for whom they had just voted. Additionally, only about three in four said they would definitely vote for the Republican nominee in November. Among supporters of Mr. Paul, this figure was about one in three.
Only a bare majority of Arizona Republican primary voters said they had a favorable impression of Mr. McCain, the Republican nominee in the 2008 presidential election. Mr. McCain's tepid favorability suggests that his endorsement of Mr. Romney may not be influential. 
Three in five Arizona Republican primary voters said that working in business better prepared a candidate to serve as president than working in government. This was also the dominant view among supporters of every candidate except for Mr. Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, whose supporters were more favorable toward government experience.
Nearly half of Arizona voters said that last week's debate was an important factor in their vote.
- 
6:09 P.M. | Exit Polls: The Economy Wins Again
As was the case in every previous exit poll conducted in this nomination race, voters in the Arizona Republican primary overwhelmingly picked the economy as their No. 1 issue in deciding whom to support (about half of all responses). The second biggest issue cited by voters was the budget deficit (about one-third of responses). The economy was the top issue concern for supporters of Mr. Romney, Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich, but supporters of Ron Paul felt that the budget deficit was more important.
Also repeating the pattern found in other exit polls this season, Arizona Republican primary voters said that the most important candidate quality was the ability to beat Mr. Obama (nearly two in five responses). While this was true among supporters of Mr. Romney, Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich, supporters of Mr. Paul were more likely to say that being a true conservative was the candidate quality they prized most (about one in three responses). 
Half of Republican primary goers in Arizona said that a candidate sharing their religious beliefs was somewhat or greatly important to their vote. 
Just as in 2008, about one in five voters said they believed abortion should be illegal in all cases.
While 40 percent of Republican primary voters in Florida said that most illegal immigrants working in the United States should be offered a chance to apply for citizenship, in Arizona this option received the support of only one in three - about equal to the number saying they should be deported. 
- 
6:01 P.M. | Santorum and Female Voters
Has Mr. Santorum angered women?
For the past week, Mr. Santorum has been taking positions that might turn off some women, especially independents from the suburbs. He focused on contraception for days and over the weekend called Mr. Obama a "snob" for advocating on behalf of college.
Those are subjects that may fire up Mr. Santorum's base, but they threaten to depress his vote among women, particularly in the parts of Michigan that are more moderate.
So the question will be whether women will decide they would rather support Mr. Romney, and whether that support will be enough to help overcome Mr. Romney's other weaknesses.
If that gender gap between the two candidates begins to widen as the night progresses, Mr. Santorum could find himself on the losing side tonight.
- 
5:58 P.M. | Exit Polls: College Graduates and Union Members
How well will Mr. Santorum's remarks about President Obama's being a "snob" about college education go over in Michigan, and who were his targets? 
Today's exit polls showed that about half of Michigan primary voters held a college degree, and about 3 in 10 had attended some college or held an associate's degree. In Florida, New Hampshire and Nevada, most college graduates supported Mr. Romney, while they were more divided in Iowa and South Carolina.
Michigan also has one of the highest union membership rates in the country. In today's primary, early exit poll results showed about one-quarter of voters said there was a union member in their household, and about one in seven said they were a union member themselves. In 2008, union households broke evenly for Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney.
- 
5:53 P.M. | Exit Polls: In Michigan, a More Moderate Electorate
With the first waves of exit polls in from voters in Michigan and Arizona, the state of Michigan has a slightly more moderate electorate than some previous Republican caucus and primary contests in 2012.
About 6 in 10 primary voters in Michigan consider themselves conservative, with about 3 in 10 saying they are very conservative and about the same number saying they are moderate, according to preliminary exit poll results.
One reason that Republican primary voters in Michigan may appear less conservative than other early nominating contests is that Michigan does not require voters to be registered Republicans, so anyone, including independents and Democrats, can temporarily call himself or herself a Republican and enter the voting booth.
And at least one candidate is taking advantage of that flexibility to try to improve his chances.
Mr. Romney has called Mr. Santorum's automated phone call lobbying Democrats to vote against Mr. Romney a "dirty trick." But Mr. Romney himself has admitted to voting in a Democratic primary as a registered independent, for Paul Tsongas, whom he thought would make the weakest Democratic presidential candidate in 1992.
So did Democrats really come out to vote in the Republican contest more than usual today? It's hard to say: Exit poll results showed that about 1 in 10 voters in Michigan today said they usually think of themselves as a Democrat. In 2008, 7 percent of Republican primary voters identified as Democrat, and in 2000, 17 percent did.
Of the other early nominating contests with exit polls, New Hampshire, which Mr. Romney won handily, had the most moderate electorate, with just 22 percent of voters saying they were very conservative, and a slim majority saying they were conservative.
In Nevada and Iowa, more than 8 in 10 voters said they were conservative, and nearly half of all primary voters said they were very conservative. Nearly 7 in 10 voters in South Carolina and Florida considered themselves conservative.

5:30 P.M. | Arizona Looks Like Less of a Nail-Biter
There are 29 delegates at stake in Arizona, and the Republicans gathered there last week for what was being billed as the last debate of the Republican contest. But in the end, the contest there is ending up as something of an afterthought, overshadowed by the fight going on in Michigan on Tuesday. The candidates have barely been in the state since the debate.
One reason? Polls suggest that this will be an easy win for Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor. For what it's worth, he received the endorsement of Jan Brewer, the Republican governor of Arizona, last week, and has the backing of Senator John McCain. And the state has a sizable population of Mormons - Mr. Romney is a Mormon - who turned out at the campaign rallies he held during his last visit to the state last week.
Unlike Michigan, this is a closed primary, meaning that only registered Republicans are permitted to vote. Polls close at 9 p.m. Eastern time. In 2008, the primary was won by Mr. McCain in what was also something less than a nail-biter.
- 
5:28 P.M. | Could Early Voters Turn Michigan?
As the Michigan votes start rolling in tonight, keep an eye on the votes that were cast before today.
Early voting rewards campaigns that are highly organized, like Mr. Romney's. They can identify voters that might support a candidate, make sure they get an early ballot, and follow up to make sure voters fill out and returns their ballot.
The expectation is that Mr. Romney's campaign has done well in early voting in Michigan. That could give him an early lead as the voting gets under way. But that lead could evaporate if Mr. Santorum's election-day voters turn out in much larger numbers.
Early voting has already made a difference in the 2012 campaign. Mr. Romney's campaign methodically pushed his supporters in Florida to vote early, helping him defeat Newt Gingrich during the primary there at the end of last month.
Will it make the same difference in Michigan? We should know soon enough.
- 
5:13 P.M. | Setting the Stage in Michigan and Arizona
The intensity of the rhetorical battle between Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum before the primaries in Michigan and Arizona would suggest that a denouement might finally be at hand.
But it's possible that little will be settled Tuesday night.
In part, that's because the race in Michigan appears to be very close; a matter of just a few thousand votes could separate the victor from his nearest competitor. Winning by a hair will hardly confer unstoppable momentum.
There's also the delegate count. Almost all of Michigan's delegates are awarded at the district level: two delegates for the winner of each Congressional district. The rules raise the real possibility that the winner of the popular vote could be on the losing end of the delegate tally.
And finally, there's Arizona. A decisive win there for Mr. Romney - who is far ahead in the state polls, even as he struggles in Michigan - would muddle the political picture from the two contests even further.

HEADLINE: Parsing the Exit Polls in Michigan and Arizona

BYLINE: ALLISON KOPICKI and DAVID R. JONES


HIGHLIGHT: Highlights so far, based on surveys of voters leaving the primary polls: a moderate electorate in Michigan and an enthusiasm gap in Arizona. 

 BODY:
10:37 p.m. | Updated 

Santorum Strong with Conservatives in Michigan
Leading up to today's primaries, Rick Santorum campaigned heavily in Michigan, but spent little time or money in Arizona, and that bet showed at the polls.
According to exit poll results, Mr. Santorum found strength among a number of key groups in Michigan to rival Mitt Romney in his home state: union households, strong supporters of the Tea Party, white evangelical Christians and those who consider themselves very conservative.
He also held a strong advantage over Mr. Romney among Michigan voters who said it mattered somewhat or a great deal that a candidate shares their religious beliefs, and those who said being a true conservative or having strong moral character mattered most in their vote.
While Mr. Santorum's recent lobbying effort to sway social conservatives to his side may have worked with evangelical Christians, it did not tempt Catholic voters - their vote divided between him and Mr. Romney. Nearly half of Catholic women voters in Michigan went for Mr. Romney, compared to less than a third for Mr. Santorum.
Voters in Michigan had concerns about Mr. Santorum's electability, hurting his opportunity of snatching the state away from Mr. Romney. Only about a quarter of Michigan primary voters said Mr. Santorum was the candidate most likely to defeat President Obama in November, and electability ranked among the most important factors for voters.
The economy was the overarching issue for Michigan voters, and nearly half of those who said the economy was their main concern were supporting Mr. Romney.
Mr. Santorum had a difficult time finding any groups to support him in large enough numbers to make a difference in his bid in Arizona, where he had little to no campaign presence and his debate performance there last week was considered lackluster.
In Arizona, Mr. Romney swept nearly all voting blocs. The former Pennsylvania senator only led Mr. Romney - and not by much - among strong Tea Party supporters, white evangelical Christians, and late-deciding voters, and tied or nearly tied with Mr. Romney among the lowest income and the most conservative voters. -Allison Kopicki
In Michigan, a More Moderate Electorate
With the first waves of exit polls in from voters in Michigan and Arizona, the state of Michigan has a slightly more moderate electorate than some previous Republican caucus and primary contests in 2012.
About 6 in 10 primary voters in Michigan consider themselves conservative, with about 3 in 10 saying they are very conservative and about the same number saying they are moderate, according to preliminary exit poll results.

Today's exit polls showed that about half of Michigan primary voters held a college degree, and about 3 in 10 had attended some college or held an associate's degree. In Florida, New Hampshire and Nevada, most college graduates supported Mr. Romney, while they were more divided in Iowa and South Carolina.
Michigan also has one of the highest union membership rates in the country. In today's primary, early exit poll results showed about one-quarter of voters said there was a union member in their household, and about one in seven said they were a union member themselves. In 2008, union households broke evenly for Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney. 
So did Democrats really come out to vote in the Republican contest more than usual today? It's hard to say: Exit poll results showed that about 1 in 10 voters in Michigan today said they usually think of themselves as a Democrat. In 2008, 7 percent of Republican primary voters identified as Democrat, and in 2000, 17 percent did.

In Nevada and Iowa, more than 8 in 10 voters said they were conservative, and nearly half of all primary voters said they were very conservative. Nearly 7 in 10 voters in South Carolina and Florida considered themselves conservative. -Allison Kopicki
The Economy Wins Again
As was the case in every previous exit poll conducted in this nomination race, voters in the Arizona Republican primary overwhelmingly picked the economy as their No. 1 issue in deciding whom to support (about half of all responses). The second biggest issue cited by voters was the budget deficit (about one-third of responses). The economy was the top issue concern for supporters of Mr. Romney, Mr. Santorum and Newt Gingrich, but supporters of Representative Ron Paul felt that the budget deficit was more important.

Half of Republican primary goers in Arizona said that a candidate sharing their religious beliefs was somewhat or greatly important to their vote. 
Just as in 2008, about one in five voters said they believed abortion should be illegal in all cases.
While 40 percent of Republican primary voters in Florida said that most illegal immigrants working in the United States should be offered a chance to apply for citizenship, in Arizona this option received the support of only one in three - about equal to the number saying they should be deported. -David R. Jones
Enthusiasm Gap in Arizona
An indicator of the lack of enthusiasm for the candidates on the ballot, half of Republican primary voters in Arizona said they strongly favored the candidate for whom they had just voted. Additionally, only about three in four said they would definitely vote for the Republican nominee in November. Among supporters of Mr. Paul, this figure was about one in three.

Even among social conservatives, the economy was the No. 1 issue - nearly half of white evangelical voters said the economy mattered most to their decision, with nearly a quarter saying either abortion or the deficit mattered the most. -Allison Kopicki

Views on Abortion
If Mr. Santorum does manage to do better in Michigan than in Arizona, as many expect, differences on the issue of abortion could be a reason. Although anti-abortion sentiment was similar in both states (three in five voters were opposed), abortion was mentioned at least two times more often as an important issue to voters in Michigan (picked by one in seven voters) than in Arizona. And in both states, Mr. Santorum's supporters were more likely to pick this issue as important to their vote than were supporters of any of the other candidate.-David R. Jones

HEADLINE: Huckabee Will Host a Presidential Forum on Fox News

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: The program is scheduled to be broadcast on Saturday, and Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum have agreed to appear. 

 BODY:
The Republican presidential candidates may have grown tired of debating one another. But there's still one television invitation they won't turn down: Mike Huckabee's.
Mr. Huckabee will host his third presidential forum on Saturday, an executive for the Fox News Channel said on Tuesday. So far three candidates, Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum, have committed. Ron Paul has still not indicated whether he will attend. 
The program, which is scheduled from 8 to 10 p.m., will be broadcast from Ohio, the executive said, speaking anonymously because a formal announcement had not been made.
Mr. Huckabee will focus the forum on jobs and the economy, a particularly potent subject in Ohio where the manufacturing sector has suffered greatly. Underscoring that distress, the setting for the event will be a now-shuttered DHL plant in Wilmington.
Wilmington was devastated when DHL, the shipping giant, reduced its United States workforce by 9,500 three years ago. The city, with only about 12,000 residents at the time, had thousands of jobs disappear.
During the program, Mr. Huckabee will be joined by Elaine Chao, a labor secretary to George W. Bush and now a Fox News contributor, and three Ohio residents whose lives have been affected by the recession.
Mr. Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas and Republican candidate for president in 2008, has said he would remain neutral during the primary and make no endorsement. Yet that has not stopped candidates from seeking his favor. His two other televised forums were attended by the leading Republican candidates.
Some candidates have even used Mr. Huckabee in their ads, much to his dismay. He demanded that Mr. Gingrich pull an ad that contained an old quote of his questioning Mr. Romney's honesty. Rick Perry, who withdrew from the race last month, used a picture of him standing with Mr. Huckabee in one of his commercials.
And a recent ad from Mr. Santorum featured a glowing quote praising the former Pennsylvania senator. "I adore Rick Santorum's conviction," Mr. Huckabee is quoted saying. 
Saturday also happens to be the date of another political event: the Washington state caucuses.

9:13 P.M. | Anxious Romney Supporters Await Returns From Michigan
NOVI, Mich. - With 20 minutes until the polls closed in Michigan, a rumor (whispered by a Romney surrogate) whipped through the news corps: Mr. Romney was going to come out and address the crowd with a "surprise" announcement. And then, just as quickly, a new, more official verdict came down from his staff: No, there would be no early glimpse of Mr. Romney.
Instead, the guests in the ballroom, which is still filling up with a mix of nervous aides, finance types and supporters, had to settle on busying themselves with the huge projector on the left side of the room broadcasting Fox News.
When the current polls flashed across the bottom of the screen - Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum in a dead heat with 40 percent each - the crowd offered up a scattered cheer. When Mr. Paul and Mr. Gingrich's far lower totals appeared next, they booed.
The next time the TV flashed results, Mr. Santorum had pulled into the lead - 40 percent to 38 percent. And then, a few minutes later, the screen crackled with static, and then flicked off. No word on whether the campaign didn't like the new numbers, or there were technical difficulties, but now the projector simply reads: "Romney."
However, good news was near. Moments after 9 p.m., an announcer spoke over the audio system to say that The Associated Press and CNN had called Arizona - a winner-take-all state - for Mr. Romney. A cheer went up in the room, and "Dancing in the Street" began blaring, as supporters in the bleachers didn't quite dance, but swayed slightly as they shook American flags and red-white-and-blue pom-poms.
- 
8:59 P.M. | Paul Speaks to Supporters in Virginia
Before the races in Michigan or Arizona were called Tuesday, Mr. Paul pledged that he would continue his presidential campaign.
Speaking from Virginia, where he hopes to do well in the voting on next Tuesday, Mr. Paul said that his campaign was "still winning a lot of delegates and that's what counts."
And he said that "it is our message that appeals to the independents, to the Democrats and to the Republican base. It's the message of liberty and the message of liberty is what we were all about."
As he has in previous election-night speeches, Mr. Paul railed against the federal government, calling for the end to the income tax and the end to the Federal Reserve System.
That prompted cheers from the raucous crowd: "End the Fed! End the Fed!"
Mr. Paul's presidential campaign has focused on caucus states, where he believes his committed supporters are more likely to turn out. There are several states holding caucuses on Tuesday.
But Mr. Paul talked very little about the logistics of his campaign on Tuesday night. Instead, he used his brief platform on national television to offer his typical stump speech.
He bemoaned warmongering and called for troops to come home from wars abroad, prompting the audience to chant, "Bring them home! Bring them home."
A surprised Mr. Paul said: "You know all my lines!"
He also called for a smaller federal government that did not spend so much and did not borrow as much.

9:00 P.M. | Romney Wins Arizona; Locked in Tight Race in Michigan
Mr. Romney has won the Republican presidential primary in Arizona, based on preliminary exit polling, but is locked in a tight battle with Mr. Santorum in Michigan, a crucial electoral battleground where Mr. Romney's hometown advantage has all but evaporated.
Mr. Romney's victory in Arizona will earn him 29 delegates, extending the lead he already has over his rivals. The win comes after his rivals largely conceded that the former Massachusetts governor would win the border state.
But Michigan has been a much tougher challenge for Mr. Romney, who was raised in the state and whose father served as the state's governor. Exit polls and early returns showed Mr. Santorum mounting a fierce challenge to Mr. Romney in a state that was not expected to be close just weeks ago.
Very conservative voters and evangelical Christians appeared to be backing Mr. Santorum in large numbers, according to preliminary results of surveys of voters by Edison Research of Somerville, N.J. The surveys show Mr. Romney is getting strong support from older voters, high income voters and moderates. Mr. Romney also won voters who said defeating Mr. Obama mattered the most in making their decision.
A loss by Mr. Romney in Michigan would be a blow to a campaign that had once hoped to quickly dispatch Republican rivals so its candidate could turn his attention to Mr. Obama and the general election campaign this fall.
Mr. Santorum had pushed hard in Michigan in the last several days even as his aides said they would be happy with a narrow loss given the prior expectation that it should have been an easy state for Mr. Romney to win.
In the last 24 hours, Mr. Romney took strong exception to a final appeal by Mr. Santorum to Michigan Democrats. Mr. Santorum's campaign paid for a series of automated telephone calls to Democratic households urging a vote against Mr. Romney.
That angered Mr. Romney, who called it a "dirty trick." Mr. Santorum defended the effort, saying he was merely proving that he can reach out to moderate voters and even to Democrats.
Exit polls seemed to show that about 1 in 10 of the voters in Michigan identified themselves as Democrats. Mr. Santorum was winning about half of those voters.

8:39 P.M. | Gingrich Speaks in Georgia
Newt Gingrich the professor returned to the airwaves on Tuesday, delivering a rambling lecture - and concession speech - long before polls closed in Arizona and Michigan.
Mr. Gingrich, whose popularity has plunged in national and state polls, basically ignored both states, heading instead to his home state of Georgia, which will vote next Tuesday.
It was there, at a college where he once taught, that Mr. Gingrich offered remarks about his continuing presidential campaign.
But it was not your typical concession speech.
For more than 15 minutes, Mr. Gingrich first related several stories about his past in Georgia, including one about how he and friends tried to cut down a dying tree, only to see it crash into a house.
He then went into a lecture about energy, the subject that he has been focused on for days.
"I think this is the most important election in our lifetime," Mr. Gingrich said. "Re-electing Barack Obama will be a disaster for the country."
Gone was the fiery political combatant who railed against Mr. Romney and his Republican rivals during the South Carolina and Florida primaries earlier this year. In fact, as he talked and talked, Mr. Gingrich hardly mentioned the other Republican candidates.
In its place, Mr. Gingrich returned to his roots as a sharp-tongued critic of Mr. Obama as he assailed the president for apologizing to the Afghanistan president for the burning of the Koran.
"I think the commander in chief owes a great deal of loyalty to the people who serve the United States of America," Mr. Gingrich said. "No one in this administration is prepared to stand up for any of our values. They are very prepared to apologize to people who want to kill us."

7:58 P.M. | Automobile Politics
Mr. Romney has taken a lot of grief for saying that his wife, Ann, drives "a couple of Cadillacs."
Lucky for Mr. Romney, Cadillac owners tend to vote Republican. And even better, they go to the polls regularly. 
Car preferences are among the data points that political strategists mine for the habits of potential voters - all part of the increasingly sophisticated effort by campaigns to use statistics to gain an edge.
Campaigns analyze consumer choices, including soft drinks and beer, television shows and magazine subscriptions. With this data, they can identify consumers' likely party affiliations and even how often they vote.
When it comes to cars, the results are often predictable. It probably won't surprise anyone to learn that the data, as collected by Scarborough Research, show that drivers of hybrid automobiles nationwide tend to skew Democrat and are highly likely to vote. The same goes for Subaru owners. Saab and Volvo owners also lean left and vote in large percentages, though not by as wide a margin.
Toyota and Honda drivers skew slightly to the left and are modestly more likely to show up at the ballot box. 
Jaguar, on the other hand, has the highest concentration of high-turnout Republicans. That brand is followed by Lincoln, Buick, Lexus and Cadillac. Mercedes-Benz drivers also tend to be Republican and vote at higher than average rates.
Ford is a Republican-leaning brand, but its voter participation rates are close to average. The same is true for Chevrolet, Jeep and Porsche.
In Michigan, the heart of the domestic auto industry, those patterns largely hold, but with some surprising variations.
The most Republican brand and the one with the highest voter turnout is Hummer. Volvo, which is often stereotyped as the car brand of choice for college professors and other well-off liberal professionals, skews Republican in Michigan.

7:34 P.M. | In Michigan, Romney Criticizes Santorum Democrats
LIVONIA, Mich. - Michigan - the state where Mr. Romney grew up as the son of an auto executive turned governor, and the state where he thinks the trees are still just "the right height" - turned into an unexpectedly close race between Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum. When Mr. Romney heads to his election night party Tuesday evening, it remains to be seen just how much of a "party" it will be.
Though it is entirely possible that Mr. Romney could win Michigan and Arizona tonight, helping tamp down the threat from Mr. Santorum and regaining some momentum of his own, Mr. Romney sought to lower expectations during a news conference Tuesday morning at his Michigan headquarters.
As late as Monday, Mr. Romney had been showing signs of confidence here, going so far as to predict a Michigan win. But on the day that voters headed to the polls, he struck a slightly softer note.
While Arizona is a winner-takes-all state, Michigan awards its delegates proportionally, and Mr. Romney made a show of focusing on the delegates rather than winning the entire state.
"What we are after is delegates, so make sure we cover all the Congressional districts where we think we have the best shot of picking up delegates," he said. "This is a race to get the delegates I need to become our nominee. We've got delegates here in Michigan, of course, district by district."
Mr. Romney added that, in Michigan, "We have got to make sure that each one of those 14 districts we get as many of them as possible and get the delegates I need."
Mr. Romney also began his remarks by referring to a flap that erupted Monday night, when Mr. Santorum's campaign admitted to calling Democratic voters to urge them to head to the polls to vote against Mr. Romney.
Later, when asked why Michigan seemed to be proving a more difficult state for him to win than expected, Mr. Romney again returned to the Santorum "robocalls."
"I think the hardest thing about predicting what's going to happen today is whether Senator Santorum's effort to call Democrat households and tell them to come out and vote against Mitt Romney is going to be successful or not," he said.
Later, in the lobby of the hotel where Mr. Romney and his staff are staying, aides sought to play up Mr. Santorum's Democrats-to-the-polls strategy, making a point of chatting with reporters about the tactic.
Though Mr. Romney stepped up Tuesday to take some of the blame for his struggling campaign, if he loses tonight, expect him and his team to lay as much of the results as possible at the feet of Mr. Santorum - and his pesky Democrats.

7:18 P.M. | Where's Newt?
Mr. Gingrich is sitting out the Arizona and Michigan primaries. He decided not to aggressively contest Arizona, and he has skipped Michigan altogether, hoping that Mr. Santorum's strength there will do serious damage to Mr. Romney. 
Instead, Mr. Gingrich is putting all his hopes for a comeback into a Southern strategy that calls for him to do well next week on Super Tuesday by winning Georgia, his former home, and finishing credibly in Tennessee and Oklahoma. It is a long-shot strategy, but Mr. Gingrich has been counted out at least twice before in this campaign and has bounded into the lead. If Mr. Santorum performs poorly in Michigan, Mr. Gingrich will be able to renew his claim to be the conservative alternative to Mr. Romney. And he is likely to be helped by a new $1.7 million television advertising campaign from his "super PAC" in the South, including in Mississippi and Alabama, which vote on March 13.
"I think for sure we're going to carry Georgia," Mr. Gingrich said Tuesday morning on NBC's "Today" show. 
Still, he was playing an unusual degree of defense in his must-win state. He began a three-day bus tour of Georgia on Tuesday. 
In recent days, he has boiled down his message to almost a single populist issue - a promise to get gas prices to $2.50 a gallon. But given Mr. Gingrich's restless mind, it is unlikely to remain the only issue for long.

7:07 P.M. | Exit Polls: Views on Abortion
If Mr. Santorum does manage to do better in Michigan than in Arizona, as many expect, differences on the issue of abortion could be a reason. Although anti-abortion sentiment was similar in both states (three in five voters were opposed), abortion was mentioned at least two times more often as an important issue to voters in Michigan (picked by one in seven voters) than in Arizona. And in both states, Mr. Santorum's supporters were more likely to pick this issue as important to their vote than were supporters of any of the other candidate.

6:57 P.M. | Exit Polls: Evangelicals and Catholics
The evangelical Christian vote has been somewhat all over the map in this year's nominating contests. Exit poll results showed Mr. Romney winning white evangelical voters in Nevada, Mr. Gingrich winning them in South Carolina, and the evangelical vote dividing between Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich in Florida. Earlier, in Iowa, Mr. Santorum won a plurality of white evangelicals.
(There were no exit or entrance polls in the Colorado, Missouri and Minnesota contests that Mr. Santorum swept this month.) 
Intensifying his pursuit of socially conservative voters in recent days, Mr. Santorum, who is Catholic, defended the role of religion in public life this weekend, dismissing John F. Kennedy's 1960 speech on the separation of religion and politics, and saying that college campuses in America are not a "neutral setting" for people of faith.
In Michigan, nearly 4 in 10 primary voters are white Christian evangelicals, according to early exit poll results, and about 3 in 10 are Catholic.
Catholic voters made up at least about one-third of voters in both New Hampshire and Florida - and in both of those states, they swung for Mr. Romney.
But only about one in seven voters in Michigan said that abortion mattered most to their vote today. Even among social conservatives, the economy was the No. 1 issue - nearly half of white evangelical voters said the economy mattered most to their decision, with nearly a quarter saying either abortion or the deficit mattered the most.

6:32 P.M. | Romney Looks to Win Conservative Voters
When Mr. Romney won Nevada's caucus on the heels of another victory in Florida, his campaign argued that he had finally made inroads with voters who call themselves very conservative.
In fact, in Nevada, Mr. Romney finally won that category, capturing 46 percent of the "very conservative" vote, while Mr. Gingrich only took 25 percent and Mr. Santorum (who did not campaign much there) took 15 percent.
But was that a fluke? Many of those who said they were very conservative also were Mormons, a group much more inclined to vote for Mr. Romney, who is a Mormon.
And a few days later, Mr. Romney got walloped in Colorado, Missouri and Minnesota. Exit and entrance polling was not available, but Mr. Santorum's campaign claimed credit for scoring big among the most conservative voters in those states.
Now, watching how those voters cast their ballots in Michigan and Arizona will be very interesting.
In Michigan, Mr. Santorum should have an edge. He has been talking at length about social issues, speaking in the kind of language that helps to fire up the Tea Party and evangelical bases of the Republican Party.
Arizona might be a bit different. The candidates have spent less time there, and immigration is a bigger deal in the border state. How does that cut for very conservative voters? That's unclear. Mr. Romney has tacked sharply to the right on the issue of illegal immigration, but Mr. Santorum is no liberal on the issue either.
The results of the "very conservative" block are probably of greater importance for Mr. Romney, who still faces questions about his ability to excite that kind of voter. If he improves tonight, that will help his campaign going forward.

6:22 P.M. | Exit Polls: Enthusiasm Gap in Arizona
An indicator of the lack of enthusiasm for the candidates on the ballot, half of Republican primary voters in Arizona said they strongly favored the candidate for whom they had just voted. Additionally, only about three in four said they would definitely vote for the Republican nominee in November. Among supporters of Mr. Paul, this figure was about one in three.
Only a bare majority of Arizona Republican primary voters said they had a favorable impression of Mr. McCain, the Republican nominee in the 2008 presidential election. Mr. McCain's tepid favorability suggests that his endorsement of Mr. Romney may not be influential. 
Three in five Arizona Republican primary voters said that working in business better prepared a candidate to serve as president than working in government. This was also the dominant view among supporters of every candidate except for Mr. Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, whose supporters were more favorable toward government experience.
Nearly half of Arizona voters said that last week's debate was an important factor in their vote.
- 
6:09 P.M. | Exit Polls: The Economy Wins Again
As was the case in every previous exit poll conducted in this nomination race, voters in the Arizona Republican primary overwhelmingly picked the economy as their No. 1 issue in deciding whom to support (about half of all responses). The second biggest issue cited by voters was the budget deficit (about one-third of responses). The economy was the top issue concern for supporters of Mr. Romney, Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich, but supporters of Ron Paul felt that the budget deficit was more important.
Also repeating the pattern found in other exit polls this season, Arizona Republican primary voters said that the most important candidate quality was the ability to beat Mr. Obama (nearly two in five responses). While this was true among supporters of Mr. Romney, Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich, supporters of Mr. Paul were more likely to say that being a true conservative was the candidate quality they prized most (about one in three responses). 
Half of Republican primary goers in Arizona said that a candidate sharing their religious beliefs was somewhat or greatly important to their vote. 
Just as in 2008, about one in five voters said they believed abortion should be illegal in all cases.
While 40 percent of Republican primary voters in Florida said that most illegal immigrants working in the United States should be offered a chance to apply for citizenship, in Arizona this option received the support of only one in three - about equal to the number saying they should be deported. 
- 
6:01 P.M. | Santorum and Female Voters
Has Mr. Santorum angered women?
For the past week, Mr. Santorum has been taking positions that might turn off some women, especially independents from the suburbs. He focused on contraception for days and over the weekend called Mr. Obama a "snob" for advocating on behalf of college.
Those are subjects that may fire up Mr. Santorum's base, but they threaten to depress his vote among women, particularly in the parts of Michigan that are more moderate.
So the question will be whether women will decide they would rather support Mr. Romney, and whether that support will be enough to help overcome Mr. Romney's other weaknesses.
If that gender gap between the two candidates begins to widen as the night progresses, Mr. Santorum could find himself on the losing side tonight.
- 
5:58 P.M. | Exit Polls: College Graduates and Union Members
How well will Mr. Santorum's remarks about President Obama's being a "snob" about college education go over in Michigan, and who were his targets? 
Today's exit polls showed that about half of Michigan primary voters held a college degree, and about 3 in 10 had attended some college or held an associate's degree. In Florida, New Hampshire and Nevada, most college graduates supported Mr. Romney, while they were more divided in Iowa and South Carolina.
Michigan also has one of the highest union membership rates in the country. In today's primary, early exit poll results showed about one-quarter of voters said there was a union member in their household, and about one in seven said they were a union member themselves. In 2008, union households broke evenly for Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney.
- 
5:53 P.M. | Exit Polls: In Michigan, a More Moderate Electorate
With the first waves of exit polls in from voters in Michigan and Arizona, the state of Michigan has a slightly more moderate electorate than some previous Republican caucus and primary contests in 2012.
About 6 in 10 primary voters in Michigan consider themselves conservative, with about 3 in 10 saying they are very conservative and about the same number saying they are moderate, according to preliminary exit poll results.
One reason that Republican primary voters in Michigan may appear less conservative than other early nominating contests is that Michigan does not require voters to be registered Republicans, so anyone, including independents and Democrats, can temporarily call himself or herself a Republican and enter the voting booth.
And at least one candidate is taking advantage of that flexibility to try to improve his chances.
Mr. Romney has called Mr. Santorum's automated phone call lobbying Democrats to vote against Mr. Romney a "dirty trick." But Mr. Romney himself has admitted to voting in a Democratic primary as a registered independent, for Paul Tsongas, whom he thought would make the weakest Democratic presidential candidate in 1992.
So did Democrats really come out to vote in the Republican contest more than usual today? It's hard to say: Exit poll results showed that about 1 in 10 voters in Michigan today said they usually think of themselves as a Democrat. In 2008, 7 percent of Republican primary voters identified as Democrat, and in 2000, 17 percent did.
Of the other early nominating contests with exit polls, New Hampshire, which Mr. Romney won handily, had the most moderate electorate, with just 22 percent of voters saying they were very conservative, and a slim majority saying they were conservative.
In Nevada and Iowa, more than 8 in 10 voters said they were conservative, and nearly half of all primary voters said they were very conservative. Nearly 7 in 10 voters in South Carolina and Florida considered themselves conservative.

5:30 P.M. | Arizona Looks Like Less of a Nail-Biter
There are 29 delegates at stake in Arizona, and the Republicans gathered there last week for what was being billed as the last debate of the Republican contest. But in the end, the contest there is ending up as something of an afterthought, overshadowed by the fight going on in Michigan on Tuesday. The candidates have barely been in the state since the debate.
One reason? Polls suggest that this will be an easy win for Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor. For what it's worth, he received the endorsement of Jan Brewer, the Republican governor of Arizona, last week, and has the backing of Senator John McCain. And the state has a sizable population of Mormons - Mr. Romney is a Mormon - who turned out at the campaign rallies he held during his last visit to the state last week.
Unlike Michigan, this is a closed primary, meaning that only registered Republicans are permitted to vote. Polls close at 9 p.m. Eastern time. In 2008, the primary was won by Mr. McCain in what was also something less than a nail-biter.
- 
5:28 P.M. | Could Early Voters Turn Michigan?
As the Michigan votes start rolling in tonight, keep an eye on the votes that were cast before today.
Early voting rewards campaigns that are highly organized, like Mr. Romney's. They can identify voters that might support a candidate, make sure they get an early ballot, and follow up to make sure voters fill out and returns their ballot.
The expectation is that Mr. Romney's campaign has done well in early voting in Michigan. That could give him an early lead as the voting gets under way. But that lead could evaporate if Mr. Santorum's election-day voters turn out in much larger numbers.
Early voting has already made a difference in the 2012 campaign. Mr. Romney's campaign methodically pushed his supporters in Florida to vote early, helping him defeat Newt Gingrich during the primary there at the end of last month.
Will it make the same difference in Michigan? We should know soon enough.
- 
5:13 P.M. | Setting the Stage in Michigan and Arizona
The intensity of the rhetorical battle between Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum before the primaries in Michigan and Arizona would suggest that a denouement might finally be at hand.
But it's possible that little will be settled Tuesday night.
In part, that's because the race in Michigan appears to be very close; a matter of just a few thousand votes could separate the victor from his nearest competitor. Winning by a hair will hardly confer unstoppable momentum.
There's also the delegate count. Almost all of Michigan's delegates are awarded at the district level: two delegates for the winner of each Congressional district. The rules raise the real possibility that the winner of the popular vote could be on the losing end of the delegate tally.
And finally, there's Arizona. A decisive win there for Mr. Romney - who is far ahead in the state polls, even as he struggles in Michigan - would muddle the political picture from the two contests even further.

HIGHLIGHT: The Times is providing live updates and analysis from the Republican primaries in Michigan and Arizona.

10:55 P.M. | Breaking Down Romney's Support
Mr. Romney's big victory in Arizona and his strong showing in Michigan were both largely fueled by the same coalition of voters that have consistently expressed their support for Mr. Romney in exit polls throughout the primary season. In particular, Mr. Romney once again did best among older voters, better educated voters and higher income voters.
In terms of issues, Mr. Romney won in both states by large margins among voters who felt that the economy was the most important issue and among those who felt the budget deficit was the most important issue.
Voters who were looking primarily for a candidate who can beat President Obama also gravitated to Mr. Romney, as did those who said experience was the most important candidate quality.
Mr. Romney, who has had to answer questions about his positions on abortion, also did much better than his opponents among voters who would approve of abortion being legal in most or all cases.
In recent weeks, Mr. Romney has been less of a heavy favorite than he had been before the voting started in January, but he continues to do best among voters who say they made up their minds before January.
Arizona Mormons Provide an Edge

Mr. Romney polled slightly better overall in Arizona than in Michigan, but the exit polls reveal that an important source of his advantage in Arizona may have been the state's Mormon population.
Among almost every group, Romney actually polled about the same in Arizona as he did in Michigan. However, his performance was surprisingly strong in a few areas. One clear advantage was among the state's Mormon population. Mormons made up nearly one out of every seven voters in Arizona's primary. Mr. Romney carried 9 in 10 of these Mormon votes.
But this advantage among Mormons also appeared to produce some other unusual voting patterns. For example, while Mr. Paul had been consistently winning younger voters, in Arizona Mr. Romney won twice as many votes among those 18 to 29. This reason becomes more clear when one considers that Mormon voters are considerably younger than the typical Arizona voter. While only 1 in 10 Arizona voters overall were between 18 to 29, among Mormons nearly 4 in 10 fell into this age category.
Similarly, while in other states Mr. Romney had generally been losing among voters who said abortion should be illegal in all cases, in Arizona he drew almost as much support as Mr. Santorum (about 2 in 5 of these voters). However, if Mormon voters are excluded, Mr. Romney only wins half as many anti-abortion votes as Mr. Santorum.

10:43 P.M. | Romney Declares Victory, With a Sense of Relief
There was a palpable sense of relief on the faces of Mr. Romney's aides as Michigan was called for their candidate - by four or five points - and they emerged from their backstage holding area. Senior advisers high-fived one another and hugged, and made little effort to hide the profound relief they felt over averting an embarrassing defeat. At least one Michigan staff member had tears in her eyes.
When Mr. Romney took the stage, at first accompanied by his wife, Ann, and his oldest son, Tagg, Mrs. Romney made a point of giving shout-outs to a long list of Michigan surrogates - including Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, Donald Trump and Kid Rock, who played a mini-show (a lone number - the Romney campaign's theme song, "Born Free") Monday night.
And Mr. Romney, before beginning his victory night speech that attacked Mr. Obama, also acknowledged what a squeaker the race had become.
"We didn't win by a lot, but we won by enough, and that's all that counts," Mr. Romney said, thanking the volunteers who had knocked on doors and made phone calls for his campaign.
- 
10:39 P.M. | Santorum Addresses Supporters and Pivots to Ohio
Mr. Santorum declared himself thankful for placing second in Michigan's primary on Tuesday, saying that he "came into the backyard of one of my opponents" and did well where no one had expected him to.
Mr. Santorum talked for about 20 minutes without directly acknowledging that he had failed to win the Michigan primary and barely mentioned the name of Mr. Romney, his chief rival.
Instead, he quickly sought to return to the message of small government and help for manufacturing that had dominated his campaign before he began talking about social issues in the past week.
"It's getting harder for people to make ends meet because we have a government that is crushing us every single day," Mr. Santorum said.
He pledged an energy policy that expands oil drilling and criticized Mr. Obama as a leader who always says "no" to the efforts of Americans to produce energy.
"We need a president who says 'yes' to the American people on energy production," Mr. Santorum said.
With an eye on the Ohio primary coming up in a week, Mr. Santorum renewed his pledge to take the corporate tax on manufacturing to zero - an issue that could play well in the Rust Belt state.
He also vowed to repeal Mr. Obama's health care plan. It was then that he mentioned Mr. Romney by name, saying that Republicans needed a candidate who would provide a contrast with the president.
"Not Romneycare or Obamacare," he said, but "you care, because that's what we believe in in America."
- 
10:34 P.M. | Santorum Was Strong With Conservatives in Michigan
Leading up to today's primaries, Mr. Santorum campaigned heavily in Michigan, but spent little time or money in Arizona, and that bet showed at the polls.
According to exit poll results, Mr. Santorum found strength among a number of important groups in Michigan to rival Mr. Romney in his home state: union households, strong supporters of the Tea Party, white evangelical Christians and those who consider themselves very conservative.
He also held a strong advantage over Mr. Romney among Michigan voters who said it mattered somewhat or a great deal that a candidate share their religious beliefs, and those who said being a true conservative or having strong moral character mattered most in their vote.
While Mr. Santorum's recent lobbying effort to sway social conservatives to his side may have worked with evangelical Christians, it did not lure Catholic voters - their vote was divided between him and Mr. Romney. Nearly half of Catholic female voters in Michigan went for Mr. Romney, compared with less than a third for Mr. Santorum.
Voters in Michigan had concerns about Mr. Santorum's electability, hurting his opportunity of snatching the state away from Mr. Romney. Only about a quarter of Michigan primary voters said Mr. Santorum was the candidate most likely to defeat Mr. Obama in November, and electability ranked among the most important factors for voters.
The economy was the overarching issue for Michigan voters, and nearly half of those who said the economy was their main concern were supporting Mr. Romney.
Mr. Santorum had a difficult time finding any groups to support him in large enough numbers to make a difference in his bid in Arizona, where he had little to no campaign presence and where his debate performance last week was considered lackluster.
In Arizona, Mr. Romney swept nearly all voting blocs. Mr. Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, only led Mr. Romney - and not by much - among strong Tea Party supporters, white evangelical Christians, and late-deciding voters, and was tied or nearly tied with Mr. Romney among the lowest income and the most conservative voters.
- 
10:14 P.M. | Romney Wins Close Primary in Michigan
Mitt Romney has narrowly won the Republican presidential primary in Michigan, deflecting a powerful challenge from Rick Santorum and bolstering his hopes of becoming the Republican nominee.
Only weeks ago, Mr. Romney had viewed his home state of Michigan as a firewall against his rivals, an important battleground state where his background and his message would carry the day.
That changed dramatically in the wake of victories by Mr. Santorum in Colorado, Missouri and Minnesota this month. Within days, Mr. Santorum surged to a double-digit lead in Michigan.
In the past two weeks, Mr. Romney battled back, aided by millions of dollars in negative campaign ads broadcast by the "super PAC" backing his campaign, and a stepped-up attack on Mr. Santorum's record.
Mr. Santorum also stumbled in a debate last week, giving Mr. Romney several opportunities to hammer his claims to being the most principled, conservative candidate. In particular, Mr. Romney seized on Mr. Santorum's admission that he voted in Congress against his principles at times.
For Mr. Romney, the victory helps mitigate what might have become a crisis for his White House bid as the campaign heads into the biggest single day of voting in one week. Voters in 10 states will cast ballots on Super Tuesday a week from now.
But the difficulty that Mr. Romney had in Michigan served to once again highlight his weakness with the base of the Republican Party. And it raised new questions about whether he could compete effectively across the Rust Belt in the general election this fall.
Mr. Santorum has already said he planned to campaign hard in Ohio, a critical state that will hold its primary next Tuesday. The race there may quickly become the next major battlefield for the two candidates. Mr. Santorum has claimed an advantage in the state, which is geographically and demographically similar to his own home state of
Pennsylvania.
Mr. Romney may also struggle in several other states. Newt Gingrich is already campaigning in Georgia, Tennessee and Oklahoma: states where Mr. Romney is not expected to do well.
For Mr. Santorum, the loss in Michigan will slow the momentum he gained from the earlier victories in February. But aides said they expected that Mr. Santorum's fund-raising could still accelerate because he was so competitive in the state.
Very conservative voters and evangelical Christians backed Mr. Santorum in larger numbers than they did Mr. Romney, according to surveys of voters by Edison Research of Somerville, N.J. But the surveys showed that Mr. Romney was getting strong support from older voters, high income voters and moderates. Mr. Romney also won voters who said defeating Mr. Obama mattered the most in making their decision.
Mr. Santorum appeared to also get a bump from Democrats, though not as much as some had predicted. Exit poll surveys suggested that about 9 percent of those who voted identified themselves as Democrats.
Mr. Santorum also benefited from his appeals to conservative voters for the past week. He criticized contraception, said that President John F. Kennedy's comments about a church-state separation made him "throw up," and he called Mr. Obama a "snob" for advocating college.

9:13 P.M. | Anxious Romney Supporters Await Returns From Michigan
NOVI, Mich. - With 20 minutes until the polls closed in Michigan, a rumor (whispered by a Romney surrogate) whipped through the news corps: Mr. Romney was going to come out and address the crowd with a "surprise" announcement. And then, just as quickly, a new, more official verdict came down from his staff: No, there would be no early glimpse of Mr. Romney.
Instead, the guests in the ballroom, which is still filling up with a mix of nervous aides, finance types and supporters, had to settle on busying themselves with the huge projector on the left side of the room broadcasting Fox News.
When the current polls flashed across the bottom of the screen - Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum in a dead heat with 40 percent each - the crowd offered up a scattered cheer. When Mr. Paul and Mr. Gingrich's far lower totals appeared next, they booed.
The next time the TV flashed results, Mr. Santorum had pulled into the lead - 40 percent to 38 percent. And then, a few minutes later, the screen crackled with static, and then flicked off. No word on whether the campaign didn't like the new numbers, or there were technical difficulties, but now the projector simply reads: "Romney."
However, good news was near. Moments after 9 p.m., an announcer spoke over the audio system to say that The Associated Press and CNN had called Arizona - a winner-take-all state - for Mr. Romney. A cheer went up in the room, and "Dancing in the Street" began blaring, as supporters in the bleachers didn't quite dance, but swayed slightly as they shook American flags and red-white-and-blue pom-poms.
- 
8:59 P.M. | Paul Speaks to Supporters in Virginia
Before the races in Michigan or Arizona were called Tuesday, Mr. Paul pledged that he would continue his presidential campaign.
Speaking from Virginia, where he hopes to do well in the voting on next Tuesday, Mr. Paul said that his campaign was "still winning a lot of delegates and that's what counts."
And he said that "it is our message that appeals to the independents, to the Democrats and to the Republican base. It's the message of liberty and the message of liberty is what we were all about."
As he has in previous election-night speeches, Mr. Paul railed against the federal government, calling for the end to the income tax and the end to the Federal Reserve System.
That prompted cheers from the raucous crowd: "End the Fed! End the Fed!"
Mr. Paul's presidential campaign has focused on caucus states, where he believes his committed supporters are more likely to turn out. There are several states holding caucuses on Tuesday.
But Mr. Paul talked very little about the logistics of his campaign on Tuesday night. Instead, he used his brief platform on national television to offer his typical stump speech.
He bemoaned warmongering and called for troops to come home from wars abroad, prompting the audience to chant, "Bring them home! Bring them home."
A surprised Mr. Paul said: "You know all my lines!"
He also called for a smaller federal government that did not spend so much and did not borrow as much.
- 
9:00 P.M. | Romney Wins Arizona; Locked in Tight Race in Michigan
Mr. Romney has won the Republican presidential primary in Arizona, based on preliminary exit polling, but is locked in a tight battle with Mr. Santorum in Michigan, a crucial electoral battleground where Mr. Romney's hometown advantage has all but evaporated.
Mr. Romney's victory in Arizona will earn him 29 delegates, extending the lead he already has over his rivals. The win comes after his rivals largely conceded that the former Massachusetts governor would win the border state.
But Michigan has been a much tougher challenge for Mr. Romney, who was raised in the state and whose father served as the state's governor. Exit polls and early returns showed Mr. Santorum mounting a fierce challenge to Mr. Romney in a state that was not expected to be close just weeks ago.
Very conservative voters and evangelical Christians appeared to be backing Mr. Santorum in large numbers, according to preliminary results of surveys of voters by Edison Research of Somerville, N.J. The surveys show Mr. Romney is getting strong support from older voters, high income voters and moderates. Mr. Romney also won voters who said defeating Mr. Obama mattered the most in making their decision.
A loss by Mr. Romney in Michigan would be a blow to a campaign that had once hoped to quickly dispatch Republican rivals so its candidate could turn his attention to Mr. Obama and the general election campaign this fall.
Mr. Santorum had pushed hard in Michigan in the last several days even as his aides said they would be happy with a narrow loss given the prior expectation that it should have been an easy state for Mr. Romney to win.
In the last 24 hours, Mr. Romney took strong exception to a final appeal by Mr. Santorum to Michigan Democrats. Mr. Santorum's campaign paid for a series of automated telephone calls to Democratic households urging a vote against Mr. Romney.
That angered Mr. Romney, who called it a "dirty trick." Mr. Santorum defended the effort, saying he was merely proving that he can reach out to moderate voters and even to Democrats.
Exit polls seemed to show that about 1 in 10 of the voters in Michigan identified themselves as Democrats. Mr. Santorum was winning about half of those voters.

8:39 P.M. | Gingrich Speaks in Georgia
Newt Gingrich the professor returned to the airwaves on Tuesday, delivering a rambling lecture - and concession speech - long before polls closed in Arizona and Michigan.
Mr. Gingrich, whose popularity has plunged in national and state polls, basically ignored both states, heading instead to his home state of Georgia, which will vote next Tuesday.
It was there, at a college where he once taught, that Mr. Gingrich offered remarks about his continuing presidential campaign.
But it was not your typical concession speech.
For more than 15 minutes, Mr. Gingrich first related several stories about his past in Georgia, including one about how he and friends tried to cut down a dying tree, only to see it crash into a house.
He then went into a lecture about energy, the subject that he has been focused on for days.
"I think this is the most important election in our lifetime," Mr. Gingrich said. "Re-electing Barack Obama will be a disaster for the country."
Gone was the fiery political combatant who railed against Mr. Romney and his Republican rivals during the South Carolina and Florida primaries earlier this year. In fact, as he talked and talked, Mr. Gingrich hardly mentioned the other Republican candidates.
In its place, Mr. Gingrich returned to his roots as a sharp-tongued critic of Mr. Obama as he assailed the president for apologizing to the Afghanistan president for the burning of the Koran.
"I think the commander in chief owes a great deal of loyalty to the people who serve the United States of America," Mr. Gingrich said. "No one in this administration is prepared to stand up for any of our values. They are very prepared to apologize to people who want to kill us."

Mr. Romney has taken a lot of grief for saying that his wife, Ann, drives "a couple of Cadillacs."
Lucky for Mr. Romney, Cadillac owners tend to vote Republican. And even better, they go to the polls regularly. 
Car preferences are among the data points that political strategists mine for the habits of potential voters - all part of the increasingly sophisticated effort by campaigns to use statistics to gain an edge.
Campaigns analyze consumer choices, including soft drinks and beer, television shows and magazine subscriptions. With this data, they can identify consumers' likely party affiliations and even how often they vote.
When it comes to cars, the results are often predictable. It probably won't surprise anyone to learn that the data, as collected by Scarborough Research, show that drivers of hybrid automobiles nationwide tend to skew Democrat and are highly likely to vote. The same goes for Subaru owners. Saab and Volvo owners also lean left and vote in large percentages, though not by as wide a margin.
Toyota and Honda drivers skew slightly to the left and are modestly more likely to show up at the ballot box. 
Jaguar, on the other hand, has the highest concentration of high-turnout Republicans. That brand is followed by Lincoln, Buick, Lexus and Cadillac. Mercedes-Benz drivers also tend to be Republican and vote at higher than average rates.
Ford is a Republican-leaning brand, but its voter participation rates are close to average. The same is true for Chevrolet, Jeep and Porsche.
In Michigan, the heart of the domestic auto industry, those patterns largely hold, but with some surprising variations.
The most Republican brand and the one with the highest voter turnout is Hummer. Volvo, which is often stereotyped as the car brand of choice for college professors and other well-off liberal professionals, skews Republican in Michigan.

7:34 P.M. | In Michigan, Romney Criticizes Santorum Democrats
LIVONIA, Mich. - Michigan - the state where Mr. Romney grew up as the son of an auto executive turned governor, and the state where he thinks the trees are still just "the right height" - turned into an unexpectedly close race between Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum. When Mr. Romney heads to his election night party Tuesday evening, it remains to be seen just how much of a "party" it will be.
Though it is entirely possible that Mr. Romney could win Michigan and Arizona tonight, helping tamp down the threat from Mr. Santorum and regaining some momentum of his own, Mr. Romney sought to lower expectations during a news conference Tuesday morning at his Michigan headquarters.
As late as Monday, Mr. Romney had been showing signs of confidence here, going so far as to predict a Michigan win. But on the day that voters headed to the polls, he struck a slightly softer note.
While Arizona is a winner-takes-all state, Michigan awards its delegates proportionally, and Mr. Romney made a show of focusing on the delegates rather than winning the entire state.
"What we are after is delegates, so make sure we cover all the Congressional districts where we think we have the best shot of picking up delegates," he said. "This is a race to get the delegates I need to become our nominee. We've got delegates here in Michigan, of course, district by district."
Mr. Romney added that, in Michigan, "We have got to make sure that each one of those 14 districts we get as many of them as possible and get the delegates I need."
Mr. Romney also began his remarks by referring to a flap that erupted Monday night, when Mr. Santorum's campaign admitted to calling Democratic voters to urge them to head to the polls to vote against Mr. Romney.
Later, when asked why Michigan seemed to be proving a more difficult state for him to win than expected, Mr. Romney again returned to the Santorum "robocalls."
"I think the hardest thing about predicting what's going to happen today is whether Senator Santorum's effort to call Democrat households and tell them to come out and vote against Mitt Romney is going to be successful or not," he said.
Later, in the lobby of the hotel where Mr. Romney and his staff are staying, aides sought to play up Mr. Santorum's Democrats-to-the-polls strategy, making a point of chatting with reporters about the tactic.
Though Mr. Romney stepped up Tuesday to take some of the blame for his struggling campaign, if he loses tonight, expect him and his team to lay as much of the results as possible at the feet of Mr. Santorum - and his pesky Democrats.

7:18 P.M. | Where's Newt?
Mr. Gingrich is sitting out the Arizona and Michigan primaries. He decided not to aggressively contest Arizona, and he has skipped Michigan altogether, hoping that Mr. Santorum's strength there will do serious damage to Mr. Romney. 
Instead, Mr. Gingrich is putting all his hopes for a comeback into a Southern strategy that calls for him to do well next week on Super Tuesday by winning Georgia, his former home, and finishing credibly in Tennessee and Oklahoma. It is a long-shot strategy, but Mr. Gingrich has been counted out at least twice before in this campaign and has bounded into the lead. If Mr. Santorum performs poorly in Michigan, Mr. Gingrich will be able to renew his claim to be the conservative alternative to Mr. Romney. And he is likely to be helped by a new $1.7 million television advertising campaign from his "super PAC" in the South, including in Mississippi and Alabama, which vote on March 13.
"I think for sure we're going to carry Georgia," Mr. Gingrich said Tuesday morning on NBC's "Today" show. 
Still, he was playing an unusual degree of defense in his must-win state. He began a three-day bus tour of Georgia on Tuesday. 
In recent days, he has boiled down his message to almost a single populist issue - a promise to get gas prices to $2.50 a gallon. But given Mr. Gingrich's restless mind, it is unlikely to remain the only issue for long.

If Mr. Santorum does manage to do better in Michigan than in Arizona, as many expect, differences on the issue of abortion could be a reason. Although anti-abortion sentiment was similar in both states (three in five voters were opposed), abortion was mentioned at least two times more often as an important issue to voters in Michigan (picked by one in seven voters) than in Arizona. And in both states, Mr. Santorum's supporters were more likely to pick this issue as important to their vote than were supporters of any of the other candidate.

6:57 P.M. | Exit Polls: Evangelicals and Catholics
The evangelical Christian vote has been somewhat all over the map in this year's nominating contests. Exit poll results showed Mr. Romney winning white evangelical voters in Nevada, Mr. Gingrich winning them in South Carolina, and the evangelical vote dividing between Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich in Florida. Earlier, in Iowa, Mr. Santorum won a plurality of white evangelicals.
(There were no exit or entrance polls in the Colorado, Missouri and Minnesota contests that Mr. Santorum swept this month.) 
Intensifying his pursuit of socially conservative voters in recent days, Mr. Santorum, who is Catholic, defended the role of religion in public life this weekend, dismissing John F. Kennedy's 1960 speech on the separation of religion and politics, and saying that college campuses in America are not a "neutral setting" for people of faith.
In Michigan, nearly 4 in 10 primary voters are white Christian evangelicals, according to early exit poll results, and about 3 in 10 are Catholic.
Catholic voters made up at least about one-third of voters in both New Hampshire and Florida - and in both of those states, they swung for Mr. Romney.
But only about one in seven voters in Michigan said that abortion mattered most to their vote today. Even among social conservatives, the economy was the No. 1 issue - nearly half of white evangelical voters said the economy mattered most to their decision, with nearly a quarter saying either abortion or the deficit mattered the most.

6:32 P.M. | Romney Looks to Win Conservative Voters
When Mr. Romney won Nevada's caucus on the heels of another victory in Florida, his campaign argued that he had finally made inroads with voters who call themselves very conservative.
In fact, in Nevada, Mr. Romney finally won that category, capturing 46 percent of the "very conservative" vote, while Mr. Gingrich only took 25 percent and Mr. Santorum (who did not campaign much there) took 15 percent.
But was that a fluke? Many of those who said they were very conservative also were Mormons, a group much more inclined to vote for Mr. Romney, who is a Mormon.
And a few days later, Mr. Romney got walloped in Colorado, Missouri and Minnesota. Exit and entrance polling was not available, but Mr. Santorum's campaign claimed credit for scoring big among the most conservative voters in those states.
Now, watching how those voters cast their ballots in Michigan and Arizona will be very interesting.
In Michigan, Mr. Santorum should have an edge. He has been talking at length about social issues, speaking in the kind of language that helps to fire up the Tea Party and evangelical bases of the Republican Party.
Arizona might be a bit different. The candidates have spent less time there, and immigration is a bigger deal in the border state. How does that cut for very conservative voters? That's unclear. Mr. Romney has tacked sharply to the right on the issue of illegal immigration, but Mr. Santorum is no liberal on the issue either.
The results of the "very conservative" bloc are probably of greater importance for Mr. Romney, who still faces questions about his ability to excite that kind of voter. If he improves tonight, that will help his campaign going forward.

6:22 P.M. | Exit Polls: Enthusiasm Gap in Arizona
An indicator of the lack of enthusiasm for the candidates on the ballot, half of Republican primary voters in Arizona said they strongly favored the candidate for whom they had just voted. Additionally, only about three in four said they would definitely vote for the Republican nominee in November. Among supporters of Mr. Paul, this figure was about one in three.
Only a bare majority of Arizona Republican primary voters said they had a favorable impression of Mr. McCain, the Republican nominee in the 2008 presidential election. Mr. McCain's tepid favorability suggests that his endorsement of Mr. Romney may not be influential. 
Three in five Arizona Republican primary voters said that working in business better prepared a candidate to serve as president than working in government. This was also the dominant view among supporters of every candidate except for Mr. Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, whose supporters were more favorable toward government experience.
Nearly half of Arizona voters said that last week's debate was an important factor in their vote.
- 
6:09 P.M. | Exit Polls: The Economy Wins Again
As was the case in every previous exit poll conducted in this nomination race, voters in the Arizona Republican primary overwhelmingly picked the economy as their No. 1 issue in deciding whom to support (about half of all responses). The second biggest issue cited by voters was the budget deficit (about one-third of responses). The economy was the top issue concern for supporters of Mr. Romney, Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich, but supporters of Ron Paul felt that the budget deficit was more important.
Also repeating the pattern found in other exit polls this season, Arizona Republican primary voters said that the most important candidate quality was the ability to beat Mr. Obama (nearly two in five responses). While this was true among supporters of Mr. Romney, Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich, supporters of Mr. Paul were more likely to say that being a true conservative was the candidate quality they prized most (about one in three responses). 
Half of Republican primary goers in Arizona said that a candidate sharing their religious beliefs was somewhat or greatly important to their vote. 
Just as in 2008, about one in five voters said they believed abortion should be illegal in all cases.
While 40 percent of Republican primary voters in Florida said that most illegal immigrants working in the United States should be offered a chance to apply for citizenship, in Arizona this option received the support of only one in three - about equal to the number saying they should be deported. 
- 
6:01 P.M. | Santorum and Female Voters
Has Mr. Santorum angered women?
For the past week, Mr. Santorum has been taking positions that might turn off some women, especially independents from the suburbs. He focused on contraception for days and over the weekend called Mr. Obama a "snob" for advocating on behalf of college.
Those are subjects that may fire up Mr. Santorum's base, but they threaten to depress his vote among women, particularly in the parts of Michigan that are more moderate.
So the question will be whether women will decide they would rather support Mr. Romney, and whether that support will be enough to help overcome Mr. Romney's other weaknesses.
If that gender gap between the two candidates begins to widen as the night progresses, Mr. Santorum could find himself on the losing side tonight.
- 
5:58 P.M. | Exit Polls: College Graduates and Union Members
How well will Mr. Santorum's remarks about President Obama's being a "snob" about college education go over in Michigan, and who were his targets? 
Today's exit polls showed that about half of Michigan primary voters held a college degree, and about 3 in 10 had attended some college or held an associate's degree. In Florida, New Hampshire and Nevada, most college graduates supported Mr. Romney, while they were more divided in Iowa and South Carolina.
Michigan also has one of the highest union membership rates in the country. In today's primary, early exit poll results showed about one-quarter of voters said there was a union member in their household, and about one in seven said they were a union member themselves. In 2008, union households broke evenly for Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney.

5:53 P.M. | Exit Polls: In Michigan, a More Moderate Electorate
With the first waves of exit polls in from voters in Michigan and Arizona, the state of Michigan has a slightly more moderate electorate than some previous Republican caucus and primary contests in 2012.
About 6 in 10 primary voters in Michigan consider themselves conservative, with about 3 in 10 saying they are very conservative and about the same number saying they are moderate, according to preliminary exit poll results.
One reason that Republican primary voters in Michigan may appear less conservative than other early nominating contests is that Michigan does not require voters to be registered Republicans, so anyone, including independents and Democrats, can temporarily call himself or herself a Republican and enter the voting booth.
And at least one candidate is taking advantage of that flexibility to try to improve his chances.
Mr. Romney has called Mr. Santorum's automated phone call lobbying Democrats to vote against Mr. Romney a "dirty trick." But Mr. Romney himself has admitted to voting in a Democratic primary as a registered independent, for Paul Tsongas, whom he thought would make the weakest Democratic presidential candidate in 1992.
So did Democrats really come out to vote in the Republican contest more than usual today? It's hard to say: Exit poll results showed that about 1 in 10 voters in Michigan today said they usually think of themselves as a Democrat. In 2008, 7 percent of Republican primary voters identified as Democrat, and in 2000, 17 percent did.
Of the other early nominating contests with exit polls, New Hampshire, which Mr. Romney won handily, had the most moderate electorate, with just 22 percent of voters saying they were very conservative, and a slim majority saying they were conservative.
In Nevada and Iowa, more than 8 in 10 voters said they were conservative, and nearly half of all primary voters said they were very conservative. Nearly 7 in 10 voters in South Carolina and Florida considered themselves conservative.

5:30 P.M. | Arizona Looks Like Less of a Nail-Biter
There are 29 delegates at stake in Arizona, and the Republicans gathered there last week for what was being billed as the last debate of the Republican contest. But in the end, the contest there is ending up as something of an afterthought, overshadowed by the fight going on in Michigan on Tuesday. The candidates have barely been in the state since the debate.
One reason? Polls suggest that this will be an easy win for Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor. For what it's worth, he received the endorsement of Jan Brewer, the Republican governor of Arizona, last week, and has the backing of Senator John McCain. And the state has a sizable population of Mormons - Mr. Romney is a Mormon - who turned out at the campaign rallies he held during his last visit to the state last week.
Unlike Michigan, this is a closed primary, meaning that only registered Republicans are permitted to vote. Polls close at 9 p.m. Eastern time. In 2008, the primary was won by Mr. McCain in what was also something less than a nail-biter.

5:28 P.M. | Could Early Voters Turn Michigan?
As the Michigan votes start rolling in tonight, keep an eye on the votes that were cast before today.
Early voting rewards campaigns that are highly organized, like Mr. Romney's. They can identify voters that might support a candidate, make sure they get an early ballot, and follow up to make sure voters fill out and returns their ballot.
The expectation is that Mr. Romney's campaign has done well in early voting in Michigan. That could give him an early lead as the voting gets under way. But that lead could evaporate if Mr. Santorum's election-day voters turn out in much larger numbers.
Early voting has already made a difference in the 2012 campaign. Mr. Romney's campaign methodically pushed his supporters in Florida to vote early, helping him defeat Newt Gingrich during the primary there at the end of last month.
Will it make the same difference in Michigan? We should know soon enough.
- 
5:13 P.M. | Setting the Stage in Michigan and Arizona
The intensity of the rhetorical battle between Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum before the primaries in Michigan and Arizona would suggest that a denouement might finally be at hand.
But it's possible that little will be settled Tuesday night.
In part, that's because the race in Michigan appears to be very close; a matter of just a few thousand votes could separate the victor from his nearest competitor. Winning by a hair will hardly confer unstoppable momentum.
There's also the delegate count. Almost all of Michigan's delegates are awarded at the district level: two delegates for the winner of each Congressional district. The rules raise the real possibility that the winner of the popular vote could be on the losing end of the delegate tally.
And finally, there's Arizona. A decisive win there for Mr. Romney - who is far ahead in the state polls, even as he struggles in Michigan - would muddle the political picture from the two contests even further.

11:27 P.M. | Anti-Bailout Position Does Not Hurt Romney
Given Mr. Romney's 2008 Op-Ed piece opposing government aid to Detroit automakers, many expected this issue to resonate in the state's Republican primary. Even Mr. Santorum's campaign made a last-minute push to get disgruntled union workers to vote against Mr. Romney for this reason. While primary voters were almost evenly divided on the issue, those who supported the bailout were no more likely to back Mr. Santorum over Mr. Romney.
On the other hand, union membership did make a significant difference in voters' preferences. One in eight voters said they personally belonged to a union and one in four said someone in their household did. Mr. Santorum handily won both of these groups, but lost to Mr. Romney among nonunion households.
- 
10:55 P.M. | Breaking Down Romney's Support
Mr. Romney's big victory in Arizona and his strong showing in Michigan were both largely fueled by the same coalition of voters that have consistently expressed their support for Mr. Romney in exit polls throughout the primary season. In particular, Mr. Romney once again did best among older voters, better educated voters and higher income voters.
In terms of issues, Mr. Romney won in both states by large margins among voters who felt that the economy was the most important issue and among those who felt the budget deficit was the most important issue.
Voters who were looking primarily for a candidate who could beat Mr. Obama also gravitated to Mr. Romney, as did those who said experience was the most important candidate quality.
Mr. Romney, who has had to answer questions about his positions on abortion, also did much better than his opponents among voters who would approve of abortion being legal in most or all cases.
In recent weeks, Mr. Romney has been less of a favorite than he had been before the voting started in January, but he continues to do best among voters who say they made up their minds before January.
Arizona Mormons Provided an Edge

Mr. Romney polled slightly better overall in Arizona than in Michigan, but the exit polls reveal that an important source of his advantage in Arizona may have been the state's Mormon population.
Among almost every group, Mr. Romney actually polled about the same in Arizona as he did in Michigan. However, his performance was surprisingly strong in a few areas. One clear advantage was among the state's Mormon population. Mormons made up nearly one out of every seven voters in Arizona's primary. Mr. Romney carried 9 in 10 of these Mormon votes.
But this advantage among Mormons also appeared to produce some other unusual voting patterns. For example, while Mr. Paul had been consistently winning younger voters, in Arizona, Mr. Romney won twice as many votes among those 18 to 29. This reason becomes more clear when one considers that Mormon voters are considerably younger than the typical Arizona voter. While 1 in 10 Arizona voters overall were between 18 to 29, among Mormons nearly 4 in 10 fell into this age category.
Similarly, while Mr. Romney had generally been losing among voters in other states who said abortion should be illegal in all cases, he drew almost as much support in Arizona as Mr. Santorum (about two in five of these voters). However, if Mormon voters are excluded, Mr. Romney won only half as many anti-abortion votes as Mr. Santorum.

10:43 P.M. | Romney Declares Victory, With a Sense of Relief
NOVI, Mich. - There was a palpable sense of relief on the faces of Mr. Romney's aides as Michigan was called for their candidate - by four or five points - and they emerged from their backstage holding area. Senior advisers high-fived one another and hugged, and made little effort to hide the profound relief they felt over averting an embarrassing defeat. At least one Michigan staff member had tears in her eyes.
When Mr. Romney took the stage, at first accompanied by his wife, Ann, and his oldest son, Tagg, Mrs. Romney made a point of giving shout-outs to a long list of Michigan surrogates - including Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, Donald Trump and Kid Rock, who played a mini-show (a lone number: the Romney campaign's theme song, "Born Free") Monday night.
And Mr. Romney, before beginning his victory night speech that attacked Mr. Obama, also acknowledged what a squeaker the race had become.
"We didn't win by a lot, but we won by enough, and that's all that counts," Mr. Romney said, thanking the volunteers who had knocked on doors and made phone calls for his campaign.
Mr. Romney declared his win in Michigan to be a "great victory" and used his speech to assail Mr. Obama's leadership as he vowed to oust him from the White House.
Mr. Romney did not mention Mr. Santorum or his other rivals in the speech, preferring instead to keep his attention trained on the general election.
"Our campaign, as you know, is about restoring the promise of America," Mr. Romney said during remarks in Michigan. "I'm going to deliver on more jobs, less debt, smaller government."
For Mr. Romney, the victory in Michigan - and another in Arizona - was a much-needed push in his efforts to become the Republican Party's nominee.
But he used the platform of a nationally televised speech to skip over the remaining months of the primary to discuss what could be a battle with Mr. Obama in the fall.
"These days when he's not spending our money or infringing on our rights, he's running for re-election," Mr. Romney said of the president. "He thinks he deserves a second term. He says we can't wait, to which I say, oh yes, we can."
- 
10:39 P.M. | Santorum Addresses Supporters and Pivots to Ohio
Mr. Santorum declared himself thankful for placing second in Michigan's primary on Tuesday, saying that he "came into the backyard of one of my opponents" and did well where no one had expected him to.
Mr. Santorum talked for about 20 minutes without directly acknowledging that he had failed to win the Michigan primary and barely mentioned the name of Mr. Romney, his chief rival.
Instead, he quickly sought to return to the message of small government and help for manufacturing that had dominated his campaign before he began talking about social issues in the past week.
"It's getting harder for people to make ends meet because we have a government that is crushing us every single day," Mr. Santorum said.
He pledged an energy policy that expands oil drilling and criticized Mr. Obama as a leader who always says "no" to the efforts of Americans to produce energy.
"We need a president who says 'yes' to the American people on energy production," Mr. Santorum said.
With an eye on the Ohio primary coming up in a week, Mr. Santorum renewed his pledge to take the corporate tax on manufacturing to zero - an issue that could play well in the Rust Belt state.
He also vowed to repeal Mr. Obama's health care plan. It was then that he mentioned Mr. Romney by name, saying that Republicans needed a candidate who would provide a contrast with the president.
"Not Romneycare or Obamacare," he said, but "you care, because that's what we believe in in America."
- 
10:34 P.M. | Santorum Is Strong With Conservatives in Michigan
Leading up to today's primaries, Mr. Santorum campaigned heavily in Michigan, but spent little time or money in Arizona, and that bet showed at the polls.
According to exit poll results, Mr. Santorum found strength among a number of important groups in Michigan to rival Mr. Romney in his home state: union households, strong supporters of the Tea Party, white evangelical Christians and those who consider themselves very conservative.
He also held a strong advantage over Mr. Romney among Michigan voters who said it mattered somewhat or a great deal that a candidate share their religious beliefs, and those who said being a true conservative or having strong moral character mattered most in their vote.
While Mr. Santorum's recent lobbying effort to sway social conservatives to his side may have worked with evangelical Christians, it did not lure Catholic voters - their vote was divided between him and Mr. Romney. Nearly half of Catholic female voters in Michigan went for Mr. Romney, compared with less than a third for Mr. Santorum.
Voters in Michigan had concerns about Mr. Santorum's electability, hurting his opportunity of snatching the state away from Mr. Romney. Only about a quarter of Michigan primary voters said Mr. Santorum was the candidate most likely to defeat Mr. Obama in November, and electability ranked among the most important factors for voters.
The economy was the overarching issue for Michigan voters, and nearly half of those who said the economy was their main concern were supporting Mr. Romney.
Mr. Santorum had a difficult time finding any groups to support him in large enough numbers to make a difference in his bid in Arizona, where he had little to no campaign presence and where his debate performance last week was considered lackluster.
In Arizona, Mr. Romney swept nearly all voting blocs. Mr. Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, only led Mr. Romney - and not by much - among strong Tea Party supporters, white evangelical Christians, and late-deciding voters, and was tied or nearly tied with Mr. Romney among the lowest income and the most conservative voters.
- 
10:14 P.M. | Romney Wins Close Primary in Michigan
Mitt Romney has narrowly won the Republican presidential primary in Michigan, deflecting a powerful challenge from Rick Santorum and bolstering his hopes of becoming the Republican nominee.
Only weeks ago, Mr. Romney had viewed his home state of Michigan as a firewall against his rivals, an important battleground state where his background and his message would carry the day.
That changed dramatically in the wake of victories by Mr. Santorum in Colorado, Missouri and Minnesota this month. Within days, Mr. Santorum surged to a double-digit lead in Michigan.
In the past two weeks, Mr. Romney battled back, aided by millions of dollars in negative campaign ads broadcast by the "super PAC" backing his campaign, and a stepped-up attack on Mr. Santorum's record.
Mr. Santorum also stumbled in a debate last week, giving Mr. Romney several opportunities to hammer his claims to being the most principled, conservative candidate. In particular, Mr. Romney seized on Mr. Santorum's admission that he voted in Congress against his principles at times.
For Mr. Romney, the victory helps mitigate what might have become a crisis for his White House bid as the campaign heads into the biggest single day of voting in one week. Voters in 10 states will cast ballots on Super Tuesday a week from now.
But the difficulty that Mr. Romney had in Michigan served to once again highlight his weakness with the base of the Republican Party. And it raised new questions about whether he could compete effectively across the Rust Belt in the general election this fall.
Mr. Santorum has already said he planned to campaign hard in Ohio, a critical state that will hold its primary next Tuesday. The race there may quickly become the next major battlefield for the two candidates. Mr. Santorum has claimed an advantage in the state, which is geographically and demographically similar to his own home state of
Pennsylvania.
Mr. Romney may also struggle in several other states. Newt Gingrich is already campaigning in Georgia, Tennessee and Oklahoma: states where Mr. Romney is not expected to do well.
For Mr. Santorum, the loss in Michigan will slow the momentum he gained from the earlier victories in February. But aides said they expected that Mr. Santorum's fund-raising could still accelerate because he was so competitive in the state.
Very conservative voters and evangelical Christians backed Mr. Santorum in larger numbers than they did Mr. Romney, according to surveys of voters by Edison Research of Somerville, N.J. But the surveys showed that Mr. Romney was getting strong support from older voters, high income voters and moderates. Mr. Romney also won voters who said defeating Mr. Obama mattered the most in making their decision.
Mr. Santorum appeared to also get a bump from Democrats, though not as much as some had predicted. Exit poll surveys suggested that about 9 percent of those who voted identified themselves as Democrats.
Mr. Santorum also benefited from his appeals to conservative voters for the past week. He criticized contraception, said that President John F. Kennedy's comments about a church-state separation made him "throw up," and he called Mr. Obama a "snob" for advocating college.

9:13 P.M. | Anxious Romney Supporters Await Returns From Michigan
NOVI, Mich. - With 20 minutes until the polls closed in Michigan, a rumor (whispered by a Romney surrogate) whipped through the news corps: Mr. Romney was going to come out and address the crowd with a "surprise" announcement. And then, just as quickly, a new, more official verdict came down from his staff: No, there would be no early glimpse of Mr. Romney.
Instead, the guests in the ballroom, which is still filling up with a mix of nervous aides, finance types and supporters, had to settle on busying themselves with the huge projector on the left side of the room broadcasting Fox News.
When the current polls flashed across the bottom of the screen - Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum in a dead heat with 40 percent each - the crowd offered up a scattered cheer. When Mr. Paul and Mr. Gingrich's far lower totals appeared next, they booed.
The next time the TV flashed results, Mr. Santorum had pulled into the lead - 40 percent to 38 percent. And then, a few minutes later, the screen crackled with static, and then flicked off. No word on whether the campaign didn't like the new numbers, or there were technical difficulties, but now the projector simply reads: "Romney."
However, good news was near. Moments after 9 p.m., an announcer spoke over the audio system to say that The Associated Press and CNN had called Arizona - a winner-take-all state - for Mr. Romney. A cheer went up in the room, and "Dancing in the Street" began blaring, as supporters in the bleachers didn't quite dance, but swayed slightly as they shook American flags and red-white-and-blue pom-poms.
- 
8:59 P.M. | Paul Speaks to Supporters in Virginia
Before the races in Michigan or Arizona were called Tuesday, Mr. Paul pledged that he would continue his presidential campaign.
Speaking from Virginia, where he hopes to do well in the voting on next Tuesday, Mr. Paul said that his campaign was "still winning a lot of delegates and that's what counts."
And he said that "it is our message that appeals to the independents, to the Democrats and to the Republican base. It's the message of liberty and the message of liberty is what we were all about."
As he has in previous election-night speeches, Mr. Paul railed against the federal government, calling for the end to the income tax and the end to the Federal Reserve System.
That prompted cheers from the raucous crowd: "End the Fed! End the Fed!"
Mr. Paul's presidential campaign has focused on caucus states, where he believes his committed supporters are more likely to turn out. There are several states holding caucuses on Tuesday.
But Mr. Paul talked very little about the logistics of his campaign on Tuesday night. Instead, he used his brief platform on national television to offer his typical stump speech.
He bemoaned warmongering and called for troops to come home from wars abroad, prompting the audience to chant, "Bring them home! Bring them home."
A surprised Mr. Paul said: "You know all my lines!"
He also called for a smaller federal government that did not spend so much and did not borrow as much.
- 
9:00 P.M. | Romney Wins Arizona; Locked in Tight Race in Michigan
Mr. Romney has won the Republican presidential primary in Arizona, based on preliminary exit polling, but is locked in a tight battle with Mr. Santorum in Michigan, a crucial electoral battleground where Mr. Romney's hometown advantage has all but evaporated.
Mr. Romney's victory in Arizona will earn him 29 delegates, extending the lead he already has over his rivals. The win comes after his rivals largely conceded that the former Massachusetts governor would win the border state.
But Michigan has been a much tougher challenge for Mr. Romney, who was raised in the state and whose father served as the state's governor. Exit polls and early returns showed Mr. Santorum mounting a fierce challenge to Mr. Romney in a state that was not expected to be close just weeks ago.
Very conservative voters and evangelical Christians appeared to be backing Mr. Santorum in large numbers, according to preliminary results of surveys of voters by Edison Research of Somerville, N.J. The surveys show Mr. Romney is getting strong support from older voters, high income voters and moderates. Mr. Romney also won voters who said defeating Mr. Obama mattered the most in making their decision.
A loss by Mr. Romney in Michigan would be a blow to a campaign that had once hoped to quickly dispatch Republican rivals so its candidate could turn his attention to Mr. Obama and the general election campaign this fall.
Mr. Santorum had pushed hard in Michigan in the last several days even as his aides said they would be happy with a narrow loss given the prior expectation that it should have been an easy state for Mr. Romney to win.
In the last 24 hours, Mr. Romney took strong exception to a final appeal by Mr. Santorum to Michigan Democrats. Mr. Santorum's campaign paid for a series of automated telephone calls to Democratic households urging a vote against Mr. Romney.
That angered Mr. Romney, who called it a "dirty trick." Mr. Santorum defended the effort, saying he was merely proving that he can reach out to moderate voters and even to Democrats.
Exit polls seemed to show that about 1 in 10 of the voters in Michigan identified themselves as Democrats. Mr. Santorum was winning about half of those voters.

8:39 P.M. | Gingrich Speaks in Georgia
Newt Gingrich the professor returned to the airwaves on Tuesday, delivering a rambling lecture - and concession speech - long before polls closed in Arizona and Michigan.
Mr. Gingrich, whose popularity has plunged in national and state polls, basically ignored both states, heading instead to his home state of Georgia, which will vote next Tuesday.
It was there, at a college where he once taught, that Mr. Gingrich offered remarks about his continuing presidential campaign.
But it was not your typical concession speech.
For more than 15 minutes, Mr. Gingrich first related several stories about his past in Georgia, including one about how he and friends tried to cut down a dying tree, only to see it crash into a house.
He then went into a lecture about energy, the subject that he has been focused on for days.
"I think this is the most important election in our lifetime," Mr. Gingrich said. "Re-electing Barack Obama will be a disaster for the country."
Gone was the fiery political combatant who railed against Mr. Romney and his Republican rivals during the South Carolina and Florida primaries earlier this year. In fact, as he talked and talked, Mr. Gingrich hardly mentioned the other Republican candidates.
In its place, Mr. Gingrich returned to his roots as a sharp-tongued critic of Mr. Obama as he assailed the president for apologizing to the Afghanistan president for the burning of the Koran.
"I think the commander in chief owes a great deal of loyalty to the people who serve the United States of America," Mr. Gingrich said. "No one in this administration is prepared to stand up for any of our values. They are very prepared to apologize to people who want to kill us."

7:58 P.M. | Automobile Politics
Mr. Romney has taken a lot of grief for saying that his wife, Ann, drives "a couple of Cadillacs."
Lucky for Mr. Romney, Cadillac owners tend to vote Republican. And even better, they go to the polls regularly. 
Car preferences are among the data points that political strategists mine for the habits of potential voters - all part of the increasingly sophisticated effort by campaigns to use statistics to gain an edge.
Campaigns analyze consumer choices, including soft drinks and beer, television shows and magazine subscriptions. With this data, they can identify consumers' likely party affiliations and even how often they vote.
When it comes to cars, the results are often predictable. It probably won't surprise anyone to learn that the data, as collected by Scarborough Research, show that drivers of hybrid automobiles nationwide tend to skew Democrat and are highly likely to vote. The same goes for Subaru owners. Saab and Volvo owners also lean left and vote in large percentages, though not by as wide a margin.
Toyota and Honda drivers skew slightly to the left and are modestly more likely to show up at the ballot box. 
Jaguar, on the other hand, has the highest concentration of high-turnout Republicans. That brand is followed by Lincoln, Buick, Lexus and Cadillac. Mercedes-Benz drivers also tend to be Republican and vote at higher than average rates.
Ford is a Republican-leaning brand, but its voter participation rates are close to average. The same is true for Chevrolet, Jeep and Porsche.
In Michigan, the heart of the domestic auto industry, those patterns largely hold, but with some surprising variations.
The most Republican brand and the one with the highest voter turnout is Hummer. Volvo, which is often stereotyped as the car brand of choice for college professors and other well-off liberal professionals, skews Republican in Michigan.

7:34 P.M. | In Michigan, Romney Criticizes Santorum Democrats
LIVONIA, Mich. - Michigan - the state where Mr. Romney grew up as the son of an auto executive turned governor, and the state where he thinks the trees are still just "the right height" - turned into an unexpectedly close race between Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum. When Mr. Romney heads to his election night party Tuesday evening, it remains to be seen just how much of a "party" it will be.
Though it is entirely possible that Mr. Romney could win Michigan and Arizona tonight, helping tamp down the threat from Mr. Santorum and regaining some momentum of his own, Mr. Romney sought to lower expectations during a news conference Tuesday morning at his Michigan headquarters.
As late as Monday, Mr. Romney had been showing signs of confidence here, going so far as to predict a Michigan win. But on the day that voters headed to the polls, he struck a slightly softer note.
While Arizona is a winner-takes-all state, Michigan awards its delegates proportionally, and Mr. Romney made a show of focusing on the delegates rather than winning the entire state.
"What we are after is delegates, so make sure we cover all the Congressional districts where we think we have the best shot of picking up delegates," he said. "This is a race to get the delegates I need to become our nominee. We've got delegates here in Michigan, of course, district by district."
Mr. Romney added that, in Michigan, "We have got to make sure that each one of those 14 districts we get as many of them as possible and get the delegates I need."
Mr. Romney also began his remarks by referring to a flap that erupted Monday night, when Mr. Santorum's campaign admitted to calling Democratic voters to urge them to head to the polls to vote against Mr. Romney.
Later, when asked why Michigan seemed to be proving a more difficult state for him to win than expected, Mr. Romney again returned to the Santorum "robocalls."
"I think the hardest thing about predicting what's going to happen today is whether Senator Santorum's effort to call Democrat households and tell them to come out and vote against Mitt Romney is going to be successful or not," he said.
Later, in the lobby of the hotel where Mr. Romney and his staff are staying, aides sought to play up Mr. Santorum's Democrats-to-the-polls strategy, making a point of chatting with reporters about the tactic.
Though Mr. Romney stepped up Tuesday to take some of the blame for his struggling campaign, if he loses tonight, expect him and his team to lay as much of the results as possible at the feet of Mr. Santorum - and his pesky Democrats.

Mr. Gingrich is sitting out the Arizona and Michigan primaries. He decided not to aggressively contest Arizona, and he has skipped Michigan altogether, hoping that Mr. Santorum's strength there will do serious damage to Mr. Romney. 
Instead, Mr. Gingrich is putting all his hopes for a comeback into a Southern strategy that calls for him to do well next week on Super Tuesday by winning Georgia, his former home, and finishing credibly in Tennessee and Oklahoma. It is a long-shot strategy, but Mr. Gingrich has been counted out at least twice before in this campaign and has bounded into the lead. If Mr. Santorum performs poorly in Michigan, Mr. Gingrich will be able to renew his claim to be the conservative alternative to Mr. Romney. And he is likely to be helped by a new $1.7 million television advertising campaign from his "super PAC" in the South, including in Mississippi and Alabama, which vote on March 13.
"I think for sure we're going to carry Georgia," Mr. Gingrich said Tuesday morning on NBC's "Today" show. 
Still, he was playing an unusual degree of defense in his must-win state. He began a three-day bus tour of Georgia on Tuesday. 
In recent days, he has boiled down his message to almost a single populist issue - a promise to get gas prices to $2.50 a gallon. But given Mr. Gingrich's restless mind, it is unlikely to remain the only issue for long.

If Mr. Santorum does manage to do better in Michigan than in Arizona, as many expect, differences on the issue of abortion could be a reason. Although anti-abortion sentiment was similar in both states (three in five voters were opposed), abortion was mentioned at least two times more often as an important issue to voters in Michigan (picked by one in seven voters) than in Arizona. And in both states, Mr. Santorum's supporters were more likely to pick this issue as important to their vote than were supporters of any of the other candidate.

6:57 P.M. | Exit Polls: Evangelicals and Catholics
The evangelical Christian vote has been somewhat all over the map in this year's nominating contests. Exit poll results showed Mr. Romney winning white evangelical voters in Nevada, Mr. Gingrich winning them in South Carolina, and the evangelical vote dividing between Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich in Florida. Earlier, in Iowa, Mr. Santorum won a plurality of white evangelicals.
(There were no exit or entrance polls in the Colorado, Missouri and Minnesota contests that Mr. Santorum swept this month.) 
Intensifying his pursuit of socially conservative voters in recent days, Mr. Santorum, who is Catholic, defended the role of religion in public life this weekend, dismissing John F. Kennedy's 1960 speech on the separation of religion and politics, and saying that college campuses in America are not a "neutral setting" for people of faith.
In Michigan, nearly 4 in 10 primary voters are white Christian evangelicals, according to early exit poll results, and about 3 in 10 are Catholic.
Catholic voters made up at least about one-third of voters in both New Hampshire and Florida - and in both of those states, they swung for Mr. Romney.
But only about one in seven voters in Michigan said that abortion mattered most to their vote today. Even among social conservatives, the economy was the No. 1 issue - nearly half of white evangelical voters said the economy mattered most to their decision, with nearly a quarter saying either abortion or the deficit mattered the most.

6:32 P.M. | Romney Looks to Win Conservative Voters
When Mr. Romney won Nevada's caucus on the heels of another victory in Florida, his campaign argued that he had finally made inroads with voters who call themselves very conservative.
In fact, in Nevada, Mr. Romney finally won that category, capturing 46 percent of the "very conservative" vote, while Mr. Gingrich only took 25 percent and Mr. Santorum (who did not campaign much there) took 15 percent.
But was that a fluke? Many of those who said they were very conservative also were Mormons, a group much more inclined to vote for Mr. Romney, who is a Mormon.
And a few days later, Mr. Romney got walloped in Colorado, Missouri and Minnesota. Exit and entrance polling was not available, but Mr. Santorum's campaign claimed credit for scoring big among the most conservative voters in those states.
Now, watching how those voters cast their ballots in Michigan and Arizona will be very interesting.
In Michigan, Mr. Santorum should have an edge. He has been talking at length about social issues, speaking in the kind of language that helps to fire up the Tea Party and evangelical bases of the Republican Party.
Arizona might be a bit different. The candidates have spent less time there, and immigration is a bigger deal in the border state. How does that cut for very conservative voters? That's unclear. Mr. Romney has tacked sharply to the right on the issue of illegal immigration, but Mr. Santorum is no liberal on the issue either.
The results of the "very conservative" bloc are probably of greater importance for Mr. Romney, who still faces questions about his ability to excite that kind of voter. If he improves tonight, that will help his campaign going forward.

6:22 P.M. | Exit Polls: Enthusiasm Gap in Arizona
An indicator of the lack of enthusiasm for the candidates on the ballot, half of Republican primary voters in Arizona said they strongly favored the candidate for whom they had just voted. Additionally, only about three in four said they would definitely vote for the Republican nominee in November. Among supporters of Mr. Paul, this figure was about one in three.
Only a bare majority of Arizona Republican primary voters said they had a favorable impression of Mr. McCain, the Republican nominee in the 2008 presidential election. Mr. McCain's tepid favorability suggests that his endorsement of Mr. Romney may not be influential. 
Three in five Arizona Republican primary voters said that working in business better prepared a candidate to serve as president than working in government. This was also the dominant view among supporters of every candidate except for Mr. Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, whose supporters were more favorable toward government experience.
Nearly half of Arizona voters said that last week's debate was an important factor in their vote.
- 
6:09 P.M. | Exit Polls: The Economy Wins Again
As was the case in every previous exit poll conducted in this nomination race, voters in the Arizona Republican primary overwhelmingly picked the economy as their No. 1 issue in deciding whom to support (about half of all responses). The second biggest issue cited by voters was the budget deficit (about one-third of responses). The economy was the top issue concern for supporters of Mr. Romney, Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich, but supporters of Ron Paul felt that the budget deficit was more important.
Also repeating the pattern found in other exit polls this season, Arizona Republican primary voters said that the most important candidate quality was the ability to beat Mr. Obama (nearly two in five responses). While this was true among supporters of Mr. Romney, Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich, supporters of Mr. Paul were more likely to say that being a true conservative was the candidate quality they prized most (about one in three responses). 
Half of Republican primary goers in Arizona said that a candidate sharing their religious beliefs was somewhat or greatly important to their vote. 
Just as in 2008, about one in five voters said they believed abortion should be illegal in all cases.
While 40 percent of Republican primary voters in Florida said that most illegal immigrants working in the United States should be offered a chance to apply for citizenship, in Arizona this option received the support of only one in three - about equal to the number saying they should be deported. 
- 
6:01 P.M. | Santorum and Female Voters
Has Mr. Santorum angered women?
For the past week, Mr. Santorum has been taking positions that might turn off some women, especially independents from the suburbs. He focused on contraception for days and over the weekend called Mr. Obama a "snob" for advocating on behalf of college.
Those are subjects that may fire up Mr. Santorum's base, but they threaten to depress his vote among women, particularly in the parts of Michigan that are more moderate.
So the question will be whether women will decide they would rather support Mr. Romney, and whether that support will be enough to help overcome Mr. Romney's other weaknesses.
If that gender gap between the two candidates begins to widen as the night progresses, Mr. Santorum could find himself on the losing side tonight.
- 
5:58 P.M. | Exit Polls: College Graduates and Union Members
How well will Mr. Santorum's remarks about President Obama's being a "snob" about college education go over in Michigan, and who were his targets? 
Today's exit polls showed that about half of Michigan primary voters held a college degree, and about 3 in 10 had attended some college or held an associate's degree. In Florida, New Hampshire and Nevada, most college graduates supported Mr. Romney, while they were more divided in Iowa and South Carolina.
Michigan also has one of the highest union membership rates in the country. In today's primary, early exit poll results showed about one-quarter of voters said there was a union member in their household, and about one in seven said they were a union member themselves. In 2008, union households broke evenly for Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney.
- 
5:53 P.M. | Exit Polls: In Michigan, a More Moderate Electorate
With the first waves of exit polls in from voters in Michigan and Arizona, the state of Michigan has a slightly more moderate electorate than some previous Republican caucus and primary contests in 2012.
About 6 in 10 primary voters in Michigan consider themselves conservative, with about 3 in 10 saying they are very conservative and about the same number saying they are moderate, according to preliminary exit poll results.
One reason that Republican primary voters in Michigan may appear less conservative than other early nominating contests is that Michigan does not require voters to be registered Republicans, so anyone, including independents and Democrats, can temporarily call himself or herself a Republican and enter the voting booth.
And at least one candidate is taking advantage of that flexibility to try to improve his chances.
Mr. Romney has called Mr. Santorum's automated phone call lobbying Democrats to vote against Mr. Romney a "dirty trick." But Mr. Romney himself has admitted to voting in a Democratic primary as a registered independent, for Paul Tsongas, whom he thought would make the weakest Democratic presidential candidate in 1992.
So did Democrats really come out to vote in the Republican contest more than usual today? It's hard to say: Exit poll results showed that about 1 in 10 voters in Michigan today said they usually think of themselves as a Democrat. In 2008, 7 percent of Republican primary voters identified as Democrat, and in 2000, 17 percent did.
Of the other early nominating contests with exit polls, New Hampshire, which Mr. Romney won handily, had the most moderate electorate, with just 22 percent of voters saying they were very conservative, and a slim majority saying they were conservative.
In Nevada and Iowa, more than 8 in 10 voters said they were conservative, and nearly half of all primary voters said they were very conservative. Nearly 7 in 10 voters in South Carolina and Florida considered themselves conservative.

5:30 P.M. | Arizona Looks Like Less of a Nail-Biter
There are 29 delegates at stake in Arizona, and the Republicans gathered there last week for what was being billed as the last debate of the Republican contest. But in the end, the contest there is ending up as something of an afterthought, overshadowed by the fight going on in Michigan on Tuesday. The candidates have barely been in the state since the debate.
One reason? Polls suggest that this will be an easy win for Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor. For what it's worth, he received the endorsement of Jan Brewer, the Republican governor of Arizona, last week, and has the backing of Senator John McCain. And the state has a sizable population of Mormons - Mr. Romney is a Mormon - who turned out at the campaign rallies he held during his last visit to the state last week.
Unlike Michigan, this is a closed primary, meaning that only registered Republicans are permitted to vote. Polls close at 9 p.m. Eastern time. In 2008, the primary was won by Mr. McCain in what was also something less than a nail-biter.
- 
5:28 P.M. | Could Early Voters Turn Michigan?
As the Michigan votes start rolling in tonight, keep an eye on the votes that were cast before today.
Early voting rewards campaigns that are highly organized, like Mr. Romney's. They can identify voters that might support a candidate, make sure they get an early ballot, and follow up to make sure voters fill out and returns their ballot.
The expectation is that Mr. Romney's campaign has done well in early voting in Michigan. That could give him an early lead as the voting gets under way. But that lead could evaporate if Mr. Santorum's election-day voters turn out in much larger numbers.
Early voting has already made a difference in the 2012 campaign. Mr. Romney's campaign methodically pushed his supporters in Florida to vote early, helping him defeat Newt Gingrich during the primary there at the end of last month.
Will it make the same difference in Michigan? We should know soon enough.
- 
5:13 P.M. | Setting the Stage in Michigan and Arizona
The intensity of the rhetorical battle between Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum before the primaries in Michigan and Arizona would suggest that a denouement might finally be at hand.
But it's possible that little will be settled Tuesday night.
In part, that's because the race in Michigan appears to be very close; a matter of just a few thousand votes could separate the victor from his nearest competitor. Winning by a hair will hardly confer unstoppable momentum.
There's also the delegate count. Almost all of Michigan's delegates are awarded at the district level: two delegates for the winner of each Congressional district. The rules raise the real possibility that the winner of the popular vote could be on the losing end of the delegate tally.
And finally, there's Arizona. A decisive win there for Mr. Romney - who is far ahead in the state polls, even as he struggles in Michigan - would muddle the political picture from the two contests even further.

HEADLINE: Breaking Down Romney's Support

BYLINE: DAVID R. JONES


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's victories in Michigan and Arizona were fueled by a familiar coalition, with Mormons providing an extra edge in Arizona. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's big victory in Arizona and his strong showing in Michigan were both largely fueled by the same coalition of voters that have consistently expressed their support for Mr. Romney in exit polls throughout the primary season. In particular, Mr. Romney once again did best among older voters, better educated voters and higher income voters.
In terms of issues, Mr. Romney won in both states by large margins among voters who felt that the economy was the most important issue and among those who felt the budget deficit was the most important issue.
Voters who were looking primarily for a candidate who can beat President Obama also gravitated to Mr. Romney, as did those who said experience was the most important candidate quality.
Mr. Romney, who has had to answer questions about his positions on abortion, also did much better than his opponents among voters who would approve of abortion being legal in most or all cases.
In recent weeks, Mr. Romney has been less of a heavy favorite than he had been before the voting started in January, but he continues to do best among voters who say they made up their minds before January.

Arizona Mormons Provide an Edge
Mr. Romney polled slightly better overall in Arizona than in Michigan, but the exit polls reveal that an important source of his advantage in Arizona may have been the state's Mormon population.
Among almost every group, Mr. Romney actually polled about the same in Arizona as he did in Michigan. However, his performance was surprisingly strong in a few areas. One clear advantage was among the state's Mormon population. Mormons made up nearly one out of every seven voters in Arizona's primary. Mr. Romney carried 9 in 10 of these Mormon votes.
But this advantage among Mormons also appeared to produce some other unusual voting patterns. For example, while Mr. Paul had been consistently winning younger voters, in Arizona Mr. Romney won twice as many votes among those 18 to 29. This reason becomes more clear when one considers that Mormon voters are considerably younger than the typical Arizona voter. While only 1 in 10 Arizona voters overall were between 18 to 29, among Mormons nearly 4 in 10 fell into this age category.
Similarly, while in other states Mr. Romney had generally been losing among voters who said abortion should be illegal in all cases, in Arizona he drew almost as much support as Rick Santorum (about 2 in 5 of these voters). However, if Mormon voters are excluded, Mr. Romney only wins half as many anti-abortion votes as Mr. Santorum.

PERSON: Eleanor Callahan 

HEADLINE: Eleanor Callahan, 95, Photographic Muse

BYLINE: By RICHARD B. WOODWARD

 BODY:
Eleanor Callahan, the muse for her husband, Harry Callahan, whose varied and sensual photographs of her taken over more than 50 years can be said to rank with Alfred Stieglitz's of Georgia O'Keeffe, died on Tuesday in a hospice in Atlanta. She was 95.
The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Barbara Callahan Hollinger. 
With her raven hair and ripe figure, Eleanor Callahan is one of the most recognizable models in the history of 20th-century photography, an inseparable part of both the life and work of one of its most renowned artists. Clothed and standing among trees in a public park, or nude and turned to the wall while clutching a radiator in an empty room, she served as a formal element within Mr. Callahan's austere compositions as well as a symbol of womanhood. From 1941 to his death in 1999, she allowed herself to be photographed by him, without complaint, hundreds of times.
Eleanor Annetta Knapp was born on June 13, 1916, to an electrician and a homemaker in Royal Oak, Mich. The middle of three daughters and the only one not to go to college, she supported herself (and later her family) with her shorthand and typing.
She met Harry Callahan on a blind date in 1933 when both worked for Chrysler in Detroit. She was a 17-year-old secretary, and he was a 21-year-old clerk in the parts department. They married three years later after he dropped out of college, mainly because he had missed being with her. Although he began to photograph earnestly in 1938, he often credited a 1941 lecture he attended by Ansel Adams with having ''freed'' him to pursue a career as an artist.
With no money between them to speak of, it was economical for the frugal Mr. Callahan to feature his wife in his pictures.
''I never initiated any of the poses myself,'' she said in a 2006 interview with the curator Julian Cox. ''Everything, photographically, was purely from Harry.'' She confessed to being ''a little uncomfortable about frontal nudity,'' but noted that ''there was not too much of that.''
In 1950, Barbara, their only child, was born, and soon mother and child were appearing in pictures that are themselves signal images of familial tenderness.
The Callahans were married for 63 years. ''And they were, I'd say, all nice ones,'' Mrs. Callahan said. ''We never had any real fights.''
The trust and interdependence between them has been chronicled in several exhibitions, most recently in ''Harry Callahan: Eleanor,'' which opened in 2007 at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta; and in ''Harry Callahan at 100,'' the retrospective now at the National Gallery in Washington.
In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Callahan is survived by two grandchildren.
As the family moved from Detroit to Chicago to Providence, R.I., Mrs. Callahan managed her husband's business affairs, leaving him all the time he wanted to be an artist. For most of their early life she earned more money as an office assistant than he did as a teacher. But even after the 1970s, when he became a lionized figure and had offers from many other models, he seldom photographed anyone but her.
''He just liked to take the pictures of me,'' she told an interviewer in 2008. ''In every pose. Rain or shine. And whatever I was doing. If I was doing the dishes or if I was half asleep. And he knew that I never, never said no. I was always there for him. Because I knew that Harry would only do the right thing.''

HEADLINE: British Authorities Demolish Protest Camp at St. Paul's Cathedral

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL; Julia Werdigier contributed reporting.

 BODY:
LONDON -- Moving after midnight, bailiffs supported by police officers dismantled a tent encampment outside St. Paul's Cathedral here early Tuesday, ending a four-month protest that caused tension within the Church of England and resonated with Britons opposed to what they see as runaway capitalist greed.
Inspired by the Occupy Wall Street protest at Zuccotti Park in New York, the camp was started late last year amid a deep economic slowdown, as jobs were being lost and social services cut even as Britain's investment bankers sought large bonuses. 
Many protesters had begun to take down their tents last week after losing a battle in court over whether they could stay. But about 50 tents remained as the bailiffs, who are responsible for enforcing English judicial decrees, and police officers moved across the plaza in front of St. Paul's.
A handful of protesters resisted, and police officials said 20 people were arrested after they clambered atop a rickety wooden structure for a final, noisy protest, holding banners aloft and rattling tambourines. Riot officers surrounded the platform and bailiffs dismantled it, witnesses said.
Many left the camp voluntarily on Tuesday. ''We haven't got any choice, and I'd rather protect the tent for another day without it being destroyed by the bailiffs,'' said Gary Sherborne, 50, speaking to The Press Association news agency.
Kai Wargalla, a 27-year-old student from Germany, said he had been part of the protest since it began in mid-October. ''It's really sad what's happening today, but I think we can be proud of what we have achieved.''
The protest fed into a broader public outrage that led many British banks to reduce bonuses to their staffs.
In a statement on Tuesday, the cathedral's authorities said the protest had also forced a re-examination of ''important issues about social and economic justice and the role the cathedral can play.''
''We regret the camp had to be removed by bailiffs,'' the authorities said, promising to continue to promote the issues raised by those from the encampment.
Shortly after the protest began, church officials were sharply divided about the institutional response to the protesters' presence outside one of London's best-known buildings, where, among many notable moments, Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer embarked on their ultimately doomed marriage in 1981.
Some, like the Rev. Giles Fraser, a top cathedral official, resigned, arguing that the church's mission to seek social justice should make it the protesters' natural ally. ''Riot police clearing the steps of St Paul's Cathedral was a terrible sight,'' Mr. Fraser said Tuesday. ''This is a sad day for the church.''
But others said the overriding concern had to be clearing the camp so that St. Paul's, which draws thousands of worshipers every week, could continue to operate without visitors' complaining of the protesters' presence.
In essence, the debate reflected a longstanding historical quandary since the Church of England is part of the country's establishment, raising questions about how far it can go in promoting social justice and embracing causes some might perceive as too radical if its views depart from the national consensus.
In the end, the dispute over what to do about the camp was resolved by lawyers rather than theologians. The land on which the protesters camped is owned by the City of London Corporation, which argued that the presence of the demonstrators interfered with passers-by and worshipers and violated zoning laws.
After the court ruled in the City of London's favor last week, the protesters took their demand for a stay to the Court of Appeal, which rejected their case.
Many British banks reduced staff bonuses by about 40 percent this year after reporting a drop in income for last year.
The chief executives of the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, both partly owned by the government after receiving bailouts, bowed to pressure and did not take bonuses for last year. The chief executive of Barclays declined to comment on whether he would take a bonus. HSBC said Monday that it awarded its chief executive $6.6 million in pay and bonuses deferred from previous years, up from $3.9 million for 2010, after profits rose 27 percent last year.

HEADLINE: There Be Dragons

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
In medieval times, areas known to be dangerous or uncharted were often labeled on maps with the warning: ''Beware, here be dragons.'' That is surely how mapmakers would be labeling the whole Middle East today.
After the onset of the Arab awakenings, it was reasonable to be, at worst, agnostic and, at best, hopeful about the prospect of these countries making the difficult transition from autocracy to democracy. But recently, looking honestly at the region, one has to conclude that the prospects for stable transitions to democracy anytime soon are dimming. It is too early to give up hope, but it is not too early to start worrying. 
Lord knows it is not because of the bravery of the Arab youth, and many ordinary citizens, who set off these awakenings, in search of dignity, justice and freedom. No, it is because the staying power and mendacity of the entrenched old guards and old ideas in these countries is much deeper than most people realize and the frailty or absence of democratic institutions, traditions and examples much greater.
''There is a saying that inside every fat man is a thin man dying to get out,'' notes Michael Mandelbaum, the foreign policy expert at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. ''We also tend to believe that inside every autocracy is a democracy dying to get out, but that might not be true in the Middle East.''
It was true in Eastern Europe in 1989, added Mandelbaum, but there are two big differences between Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Many Eastern European countries had a recent liberal past to fall back on -- after the artificially imposed Soviet communism was removed. And Eastern Europe also had a compelling model and magnet for free-market democracy right next door: the European Union. Most of the Arab-Muslim world has neither, so when the iron lid of autocracy comes off they fall back, not on liberalism, but Islamism, sectarianism, tribalism or military rule.
To be sure, we have to remember how long it took America to build its own liberal political order and what freaks that has made us today. Almost four years ago, we elected a black man, whose name was Barack, whose grandfather was a Muslim, to lead us out of our worst economic crisis in a century. We're now considering replacing him with a Mormon, and it all seems totally normal. But that normality took more than 200 years and a civil war to develop.
The Arabs and Afghans are in their first decade. You see in Syria how quickly the regime turned the democracy push there into a sectarian war. Remember, the opposition in Syria began as a largely peaceful, grass-roots, pan-Syrian movement for democratic change. But it was deliberately met by President Bashar al-Assad with murder and sectarian venom. He wanted to make the conflict about his Alawite minority versus the country's Sunni Muslim majority as a way of discrediting the opposition and holding his base.
As Peter Harling and Sarah Birke, experts on the Middle East who have been in Syria, wrote in a recent essay: ''Rather than reform, the regime's default setting has been to push society to the brink. As soon as protests started ... state media showed staged footage of arms being found in a mosque in Dara'a, the southern city where protests first broke out, and warned that a sit-in in Homs ... was an attempt to erect a mini-caliphate. This manipulation of Syrians meant the regime was confident that the threat of civil war would force citizens and outside players alike to agree on preserving the existing power structure as the only bulwark against collapse.''
You see the same kind of manipulation of emotions in Afghanistan. U.S. troops accidentally burned some Korans, and President Obama apologized. Afghans nevertheless went on a weeklong rampage, killing innocent Americans in response -- and no Afghan leader, even our allies, dared to stand up and say: ''Wait, this is wrong. Every week in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq, Muslim suicide bombers kill other Muslims -- holy people created in the image of God -- and there's barely a peep. Yet the accidental burning of holy books by Americans sparks outbursts and killings. What does our reaction say about us?'' They need to have that conversation.
In Egypt, every day it becomes clearer that the Army has used the Tahrir uprising to get rid of its main long-term rival for succession -- President Hosni Mubarak's more reform-minded son, Gamal. Now, having gotten rid of both father and son, the Army is showing its real hand by prosecuting American, European and Egyptian democracy workers for allegedly working with ''foreign agents'' -- the C.I.A., Israel and the Jewish lobby -- to destabilize Egypt. This is a patently fraudulent charge, but one meant to undermine the democrats demanding that the Army step aside.
The Arab/Muslim awakening phase is over. Now we are deep into the counter-revolutionary phase, as the dead hands of the past try to strangle the future. I am ready to consider any ideas of how we in the West can help the forces of democracy and decency win. But, ultimately, this is their fight. They have to own it, and I just hope it doesn't end -- as it often does in the land of dragons -- with extremists going all the way and the moderates just going away.

HEADLINE: Women's Health Care at Risk

 BODY:
A wave of mergers between Roman Catholic and secular hospitals is threatening to deprive women in many areas of the country of ready access to important reproductive services. Catholic hospitals that merge or form partnerships with secular hospitals often try to impose religious restrictions against abortions, contraception and sterilization on the whole system. 
This can put an unacceptable burden on women, especially low-income women and those who live in smaller communities where there are fewer health care options. State regulators should closely examine such mergers and use whatever powers they have to block those that diminish women's access to medical care.
Gov. Steve Beshear of Kentucky, for example, recently turned down a bid by a Catholic health system to merge with a public hospital that is the chief provider of indigent care in Louisville. He cited concerns about loss of control of a public asset and restrictions on reproductive services.
The nation's 600 Catholic hospitals are an important part of the health care system. They treat one-sixth of all hospital patients, and are sometimes the only hospital in a small community. They receive most of their operating income from public insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid and from private insurers, not from the Catholic Church. They are free to deliver care in accord with their religious principles, but states and communities have an obligation to make sure that reproductive care remains available. This should be a central goal for government officials who have a role in approving such consolidations.
As Reed Abelson wrote in a recent report in The Times, these mergers are driven by shifts in health care economics. Some secular hospitals are struggling to survive and eager to be rescued by financially stronger institutions, which in many cases may be Catholic-affiliated. By one estimate, 20 mergers between Catholic and non-Catholic hospitals have been announced over the past three years and more can be expected.
The 2009 ''Ethical and Religious Directives'' issued by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops warns that Catholic institutions should avoid entering into partnerships ''that would involve them in cooperation with the wrongdoing of other providers.'' Catholic hospitals have refused to terminate pregnancies, provide contraceptive services, offer a standard treatment for ectopic pregnancies, or allow sterilization after caesarean sections (women seeking tubal ligations are then forced to have a second operation elsewhere, exposing them to additional risks).
In one case, the sole hospital in a rural area in southeastern Arizona announced in 2010 that it would partner with an out-of-state Catholic health system, and would immediately adhere to Catholic directives that forbid certain reproductive health services. As a result, a woman whose doctors wanted to terminate a pregnancy to save her life had to be sent 80 miles away for treatment. A coalition of residents, physicians and activists campaigned against the merger and it was called off before it was finalized.
Over the past 15 years, MergerWatch, an advocacy group based in New York City, has helped block or reverse 37 mergers and reached compromises in 22 others that saved at least some reproductive services. As mergers become more common, state and local leaders would be wise to block proposals that restrict health services.

HEADLINE: Swap Talks Could Test The Market

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
The financial system could face a test this week as industry officials debate a provision of the Greek bailout.
Greece is preparing to overhaul its bonds next month, a restructuring that could potentially prompt payouts on credit-default swaps, the financial instruments that protect against losses on debt. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association will meet on Thursday to decide whether a certain aspect of the deal will make those payments necessary.
If parties have to make good on the credit-default swaps, the situation could send shivers through the market. An important and long-planned measure that aims to strengthen the derivatives market is not yet in place, raising questions about how the financial system will react if the credit-default swaps have to pay out. 
In the financial crisis of 2008, banks feared that their trading partners might not be able to meet such obligations on derivatives and other financial arrangements. The situation set off a chain reaction that paralyzed global markets until governments and central banks provided enormous financial support.
To prevent a similar disaster from happening again, finance ministers in the United States and Europe committed in 2009 to move derivatives like credit-default swaps onto clearinghouses. These organizations, if they work properly, can sharply reduce the chances that a large bank will not make good on their contracts.
But credit swaps that pay out if a European country defaults are not yet centrally cleared. Instead, banks remain largely responsible for making sure the various parties can meet their obligations. While financial firms have taken steps to ensure counterparties can pay, some industry participants say the market would be far stronger if central clearing existed now for the swaps.
John Sprow, chief risk officer at Smith Breeden Associates, a fund management firm, said regulators could have used the relative calm in the markets over the last two years to reduce risks in places like the credit-default swap market. ''There's no doubt, that, by having central clearing, you'd mitigate counterparty risk,'' he said.
A small number of credit-default swaps have moved onto clearinghouses, but not swaps on European sovereign debt, even though they are traded relatively frequently and lie at the heart of the Continent's debt maelstrom.
The reason for the delay in Europe appears to reside with the Financial Services Authority, the British financial regulator. The regulator has yet to approve credit-default swaps on sovereign debt for clearing. The American-based IntercontinentalExchange has said it is in a position to start doing so through a European arm. IntercontinentalExchange started clearing default swaps on Latin American government debt last year after it received approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The British regulator declined to comment.
Clearinghouses have played a major role in strengthening other parts of the derivatives market, like futures. When executing trades through a clearinghouse, market participants have to back up their deals with adequate collateral in case they suddenly cannot make payments. As a result, when a potentially destabilizing event happens, banks are less likely to panic, because they believe money they are owed on trades will be paid.
With Greece moving toward default, all eyes are on how credit-default swaps will behave. One worry is that they may not pay out, even when bondholders suffer a loss. While the Greek bailout package could force investors to take a 70 percent haircut on the country's bonds, the restructuring was set up as a potentially voluntary exchange, an outcome that would not prompt the credit-default swaps.
But a voluntary exchange looks increasingly unlikely. Greece is preparing to use legal means to force all qualifying bondholders to accept a haircut.
Now, industry officials will have to decide whether the credit-default swaps will pay out.
This week, an undisclosed entity officially asked the International Swaps and Derivatives Association to debate whether a particular feature of the Greek debt exchange could activate the swaps. The association said Tuesday that a committee would consider this question on Thursday.
One part of the Greek exchange being examined allows the European Central Bank to avoid a haircut on the Greek bonds it holds, even though other creditors take a hit. In effect, the committee has to decide whether this constitutes the type of ''subordination'' for non-E.C.B. bondholders that would prompt a payout on Greek credit-default swaps. Subordination describes the process of relegating a creditor's claim below that of others.
Rating agencies have already said that the European Central Bank's move amounts to economic subordination for bondholders. But some lawyers don't think it will cause the default swaps to pay out, since subordination is narrowly defined in the swaps' contracts.
''I can't see any legal event that would also be a credit event,'' said Simon Firth, a partner at Linklaters in London. A required payout would most likely happen if a bond issuer actually changed the terms of some existing bonds to make them subordinate, he said, and he added that shielding the central bank from losses did not appear to do this.
Still, some analysts say they believe that such a move would undermine the credibility of credit-default swaps. ''It may result in investors deciding it's just too uncertain to enter into C.D.S.,'' said Peter Green, a partner with Morrison & Foerster in London.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: For Corporations, the U.S. Tax Code Adds to Debt's Allure

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff, a former corporate lawyer, is a professor of law and finance at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
Corporate America's love affair with debt is driven by a heavy subsidy, courtesy of the federal tax code. It's an unhealthy preference that the Obama administration is now reviewing.
The problem arises because the interest that corporations pay on their debt is deductible on their federal taxes.
To understand the effect of this deduction, imagine if you could deduct the interest you pay on your debt. I am not just talking about the deduction on your home mortgage. This would be a deduction for all of the interest paid on your credit card bills, auto loans and any other loans you had, including the one from Uncle Mikey. 
What would be the effect? First, you would have more money in your pocket. That 10- or 15-something percent interest rate on your credit card would be effectively reduced by up to a third, depending upon your tax rate.
But because debt is now cheaper, you may be more likely to borrow to make purchases rather than purchase items outright. If so, you would end up taking on more aggregate debt and saving less. Before the 1986 tax overhaul, credit card interest could in fact be deducted. Congress eliminated this loophole, in part, because members thought it encouraged just this sort of behavior.
This is what is occurring in corporate America. Companies can finance investment from either debt or equity. But profit on an investment financed with equity - stock issued by the company - is taxed. In contrast, if the project is financed with debt, then only the profit after interest payments are made is taxed. This means debt-financed investments are cheaper than equity.
This creates a bias by corporations toward debt.
The big winners are capital-intensive industries that rely heavily on debt to finance their operations, like utilities and manufacturers. But companies owned by private equity firms also benefit substantially since they borrow substantial amounts of cash in buyouts.
The debt bias is even greater when you take into account the tax deduction for rapid depreciation of investment. The Treasury estimates that corporations pay an effective marginal tax rate of 37 percent, allowing for depreciation, when they issue stock to invest in goods and equipment. In contrast, if a company finances the purchase with debt, the effective marginal tax rate is minus 60 percent when the effect of accelerated depreciation is taken into account. This means that for every $100 of debt taken on and invested, the effective tax deduction is $160. But for equity, the company and its investors pay $37.
Compare this with tax-friendly Ireland, where the effective marginal tax rate is 15 percent for an equity investment in equipment, but minus 4 percent when the investment is financed with debt. Or Japan, where the tax rate rises to 49 percent for equity and is also minus 4 percent for debt financing.
Some complain that the base tax rate of 35 percent in the United States is too high. But in the case of debt and depreciation, the United States is a world leader. The United States tax subsidy for debt when depreciation is taken into account is almost triple the average for the Group of 7 and other developed countries.
While overall United States corporate debt levels have fallen over the years, it is not hard to conclude that the tax code is creating incentives for companies to take on more debt than they otherwise would. The extra debt can lead to higher bankruptcy rates, higher administration costs and excessive risk-taking. Too much debt can make recessions last longer as companies struggle to shake off their burden.
When President Obama announced his proposal on the corporate tax code, much of the attention was on the suggested reduction in the corporate tax rate, to 28 percent from 35 percent.
But Mr. Obama's proposal also recognized that ''outsized reliance on debt financing can increase the risk of financial distress and thus raise the likelihood of bankruptcy.'' But the proposal does not address whether to eliminate the interest tax deduction.
Wouldn't that be the simple answer to the problem?
Nothing is ever simple in taxes, alas. Eliminating the interest tax deduction may reduce investment, and result in country arbitrage as companies shift debt and equity to offshore subsidiaries with more favorable tax regimes.
A report last year from the International Monetary Fundsuggested that the debt bias be eliminated by allowing companies to have an equivalent deduction for equity. But giving a tax deduction for equity would only make things more complex because companies would then argue over how equity should be valued for the deduction. And overall corporate tax rates would probably have to rise to account for this adjustment.
The International Monetary Fund's recommendation was in line with that of a bipartisan panel established by President George W. Bush in 2005, which proposed putting debt and equity on equal footing for tax purposes.
The fund's report also examined why the debt tax deduction might be appropriate. Banks are generally less willing to lend to corporations because they have insufficient information about them. A debt tax deduction can make borrowing easier for companies.
Moreover, there are reasons to allow corporations, but not people, to deduct debt. The tax deduction on debt comes about because corporations are taxed only on their earnings. The interest paid is subtracted from their earnings. Corporations are not using this debt to finance their day-to-day operations as people might; this is debt taken on to make investments.
It is the uncertainty and complications surrounding an elimination of the debt tax deduction that probably kept the Obama administration from proposing a solution. No doubt, the administration is also positioning itself for hard bargaining ahead. And realistically the chance of any tax overhaul's occurring before the election is about the same as that of an outbreak of world peace.
The president did hint at which course he prefers, however. The report focused on how the United States is oversubsidizing debt compared with other nations, establishing a case for cutting back the debt deduction to put it on parity with those of other countries. This option was also laid out by his Economic Recovery Advisory Board in its 2010 report on tax reform. In that case, only a portion of debt would be tax deductible rather than all of it.
This seems a sensible place to start, reducing the huge subsidy for debt to bring the United States more in line with other nations. This is one area of the global economy where the United States may be too competitive. Subsidizing corporate debt is just too risky.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Amid Victory, Echo of Doubt

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
SOUTHFIELD, Mich. -- After 5 caucuses, 6 primaries, 20 debates and $30 million in television commercials, Mitt Romney leaves here facing the same stubborn question: Can a onetime Northeastern governor with a history of ideological migration win the Republican presidential nomination in the era of the Tea Party, with all its demands of political purity and passion?
Mr. Romney's victory here, in the state where he was born and raised, should help him quiet some of the anxiety in the party about his strength as a candidate. But Rick Santorum, in their sometimes vitriolic head-to-head matchup, exposed once again Mr. Romney's weakness among social conservatives, making the kinds of fervent appeals to evangelicals that Mr. Romney, a onetime supporter of abortion rights, could not and, he suggested on Tuesday, would not. 
''I'm not willing to light my hair on fire to try to get support,'' Mr. Romney said.
Mr. Romney chose Michigan nearly a year ago to deliver a speech in which he tried to inoculate himself against criticism that his Massachusetts health care law was the model for the national overhaul pushed by President Obama. But the issue continued to dog him in the primary campaign, undercutting his support among small-government Tea Party supporters.
''Why would we nominate someone who is uniquely unqualified to take on the biggest issues of the day in this election?'' Mr. Santorum asked a gathering of conservatives near here last week.
In a region that was hit especially hard by the economic downturn, the main rationale for Mr. Romney's hoped-for general election candidacy against Mr. Obama -- that his business acumen is desperately needed to fix the economy -- began to show pressure cracks amid signs of job growth and returning corporate profits. As Michigan and Arizona voters went to the polls on Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 13,000 for the first time since 2008.
Mr. Romney's victories on Tuesday over Mr. Santorum in Michigan and Arizona, after a triple-loss three weeks ago in Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri, showed once again that when his back is against the wall, he and his muscular campaign operation can find a way to win. He remains his party's most plausible nominee and benefits from an experienced organization and deep-pocketed backers.
But he continues to face questions about whether, should he win the nomination, he will be able to capture the energy of the conservative constituencies that have propelled the party when it has had electoral success in recent years, especially evangelicals and the Tea Party movement.
''It does seem that his campaign is having a tough time sort of garnering that -- not just that support, but that energy that's needed,'' former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, a favorite of the movement, said in an interview late Tuesday. ''Whether Romney wins or loses in Michigan tonight, just the fact that he's had such a fight in his home state is evidence of that blessing not yet being given to him across the board.''
Ms. Palin said that if Mr. Romney became the nominee she would support him ''100 percent,'' but that he still had considerable work to do to get important portions of the party base on his side. Particularly important, she said, are ''those that are part of that Tea Party grass-roots movement,'' who ''really get offended when the establishment of either party tries to anoint the candidate.''
With his victories Tuesday, Mr. Romney increased his early lead where it matters most in the nominating fight -- in delegates.
But he heads into Super Tuesday next week -- when 10 states, including Georgia, Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia, will hold contests -- with his vulnerabilities more exposed to the political elements than they have been so far. And his rivals, chief among them Mr. Santorum and also Newt Gingrich, are promising to press very strong challenges in nearly all of those states.
Mr. Romney's unforced errors here threatened to turn his appeal as a seasoned and successful chief executive against him by allowing his critics and opponents to portray him instead as an out-of-touch capitalist far removed from the deep concerns of the middle class.
They quickly seized on his statements that his wife owned two Cadillacs and that some of his close friends owned Nascar teams.
By contrast, Mr. Santorum has successfully played up his own working-class credentials, something he is planning to do with more focus in coming battlegrounds like Ohio. As Foster S. Friess, who has donated heavily to the ''super PAC'' supporting Mr. Santorum, said in an e-mail on Tuesday, Mr. Santorum is ''a coal miner's grandson to boot.''
But Mr. Santorum has been able to press a still more aggressive case that Mr. Romney has ceded the Tea Party's antigovernment position through his health care plan, among other policies he pushed while governor of Massachusetts. ''Santorum has done a good job in pointing out that Achilles' heel in Romneycare,'' Ms. Palin said.
And Mr. Santorum has cast the contest with Mr. Romney as a choice between going along to get along and sticking to the principles that helped the Republicans win last November.
''We don't need a Pyrrhic victory,'' he told the conservative group Americans for Prosperity last week. ''Every time we've nominated a moderate, we've lost. Every time we've nominated a conservative -- a complete conservative on all of the issues, by the way -- we've won.''
Yet there are those conservatives who view Mr. Romney as plenty conservative enough and are eager to move on to the battle to defeat Mr. Obama, with Mr. Romney as the nominee.
''Frankly, the candidates are so close ideologically, I just think that we're losing sight of the huge gulf between our candidates and Obama,'' said James Bopp Jr., a conservative lawyer and party official in Indiana who supports Mr. Romney. ''We're suffering from the 'grass is always greener' syndrome.''
For his part, Mr. Romney appeared stoic on Tuesday as he worked out in a hotel gym here in the early afternoon, telling a reporter who was exercising nearby that he was planning for a long night -- which is likely to be followed by several more before the party has a nominee.

HEADLINE: Cablevision Says Income Dropped 47%

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The Cablevision Systems Corporation posted a 47 percent decline in fourth-quarter income on Tuesday and said its free cash flow would be lower this year because of an increase in capital expenses, results that set off a 10 percent decline in its share price. 
Discussing the earnings on a conference call, the chief financial officer, Gregg Seibert, said the company planned no increases in subscriber fees this year, a move that, along with investments in cable set-top boxes and costs to upgrade networks, would reduce free cash flow.
Fourth-quarter net income fell to $60.5 million, or 22 cents a share, from $114 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier, when AMC Networks contributed to profit, the company said. Net sales rose 7.3 percent to $1.69 billion. Analysts had forecast $1.68 billion on average.
Stock in Cablevision, which is based in Bethpage, N.Y., fell almost 10 percent, to $14.13 a share.
Cablevision's chief executive, James Dolan, said on the conference call that the company would cease offering its lowest-price introductory packages to new subscribers because rates had become too low to make economic sense.
Mr. Dolan said he would run Cablevision's operations for the foreseeable future instead of immediately hiring a replacement for the former chief operating officer Tom Rutledge, who left in December.
Cablevision lost 14,000 video subscribers in the quarter, compared with the average analyst estimate for a decline of 9,000. As Cablevision duels for customers with Verizon FiOS, video margins are being squeezed as prices decline to entice new subscribers, said Michael McCormack, an analyst at Nomura Securities International in New York. Cable operating margin, excluding one-item adjustments, was 39.1 percent, down from a year ago as a result of increases in programming costs, Mr. Seibert said.
The company added a net of 20,000 high-speed data customers and 31,000 phone subscribers in the quarter. Analysts had expected 16,000 net broadband additions and 19,000 phone customers.

Struck at the peak of the buyout boom five years ago, the $45 billion acquisition of the Texas energy giant TXU - the biggest leveraged buyout in history - has been a painful investment for its private equity owners.
They did not need Warren E. Buffett to remind them how bad things were.
America's most famous investor, in his annual shareholder letter on Saturday, highlighted his $2 billion wrong-way bet on the bonds of the company, which its new owners have renamed Energy Future Holdings. He called the investment ''a big mistake'' and said it was at risk of losing all of its value.
''In tennis parlance, this was a major unforced error,'' Mr. Buffett wrote. 
Mr. Buffett's grim view of his Energy Future Holdings position underscores the troubles facing the Texas utility, which is owned by a group of private equity firms led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, TPG Capital and the buyout arm of Goldman Sachs.
Last week, Energy Future Holdings reported a 2011 loss of $1.9 billion amid record low natural gas prices. Its retail business has lost about 17 percent of its customers over the last three years to cheaper rivals. Worsening the company's weak financial performance is its prodigious debt load of $35 billion, most of which was added to the balance sheet to finance the buyout.
Energy Future Holdings was the biggest of the so-called megabuyouts - huge deals struck during the market boom of 2005 to 2007. After the financial crisis hit, it seemed that these deals were destined for bankruptcy. Instead, most of them - a group that includes Freescale Semiconductor and Caesars Entertainment - have made it through the downturn, though the investment returns on these deals are expected to be modest. A few, like the hospital chain H.C.A., have earned big profits.
Not so with Energy Future Holdings. For now, the $8.3 billion in equity invested in the deal by the private equity owners has been all but wiped out on paper. K.K.R. is holding its Energy Future Holdings investment at 10 cents on the dollar, or down 90 percent, according to its latest securities filing.
Allan Koenig, a spokesman for Energy Future Holdings, defended the company. He said it was operating extremely well across all of its businesses, had increased its employment by 25 percent under private equity ownership, and was hedged against low natural gas prices this year. The company's weak financial performance won't cause any defaults on its debt obligations, he said, because it has restructured its balance sheet so the first maturities on its bonds do not come due until 2014.
Yet a growing chorus of analysts and bond investors is skeptical of Energy Future Holdings' ability to survive under its current debt-heavy capital structure. The company's bonds are trading at deeply distressed levels that suggest a high likelihood of default. Energy Future Holdings bonds due in 2015 recently traded at 28 cents on the dollar, offering a yield of 60 percent.
''If natural gas prices remain low, there is no way this can work in the long run,'' said Peter J. Thornton, an analyst at KDP Investment Advisors.
Energy Future Holdings has avoided deeper problems by tapping the hot market for high-yield debt, or junk bonds. With the Federal Reserve signaling low interest rates into 2014, investors are shunning Treasuries and pushing into riskier bonds that pay higher yields.
This has allowed troubled companies like Energy Future Holdings to raise money in the bond market. In recent weeks, the company raised about $1.1 billion in high-yield bonds in part to repay loans that it owed to one of its subsidiaries.
But Mr. Thornton, the KDP analyst, said that repeatedly tapping the bond market to raise new funds was a Band-Aid solution to a larger problem.
''It seems to us that they're effectively borrowing more now to increase cash and be able to pay interest in the future,'' he said. ''That's not a good long-term strategy.''
The TXU takeover, which was announced in February 2007, was not supposed to turn out this way. A storied century-old business originally called Texas Power & Light, TXU was one of the most profitable utilities in the country. It operated in the large and deregulated Texas electricity market, with holdings that included the state's biggest power-generation business and largest electricity retailer. And as the economy boomed, demand for electricity rose.
It was such a promising deal that several of Wall Street's largest banks - Lehman Brothers and Citigroup among them - invested alongside K.K.R., TPG and Goldman.
The new owners recruited several Texas power brokers to join Energy Future Holdings and help the heavily regulated utility with government relations. They named as chairman Donald L. Evans, the former commerce secretary under President George W. Bush. James A. Baker III, a senior official in the Reagan and Bush administrations, was named advisory chairman.
While Mr. Evans and Mr. Baker have assisted the company on political and regulatory issues, they have no control over the price of natural gas, which has fallen since the buyout, putting pressure on the price of wholesale electricity.
Natural gas prices dropped to a 10-year low of $2.32 per million British thermal units last month, from about $13 during the summer of 2008, mainly because of an unusually warm winter. Andrew DeVries, an analyst at CreditSights, estimates that natural gas needs to reach a price of at least $6.15 for Energy Future Holdings to break even after its interest payments and other expenses.
Consensus expectations put long-term natural gas prices between $4.50 and $5, according to the futures market and an average of Wall Street analysts estimates as compiled by Bloomberg.
''The low price of natural gas provides a significant challenge for the company,'' John F. Young, the chief executive of Energy Future Holdings, acknowledged in the company's earnings call last week.
One reason for the plummeting price of natural gas has been the sharp rise in domestic natural gas exploration, which has created more supply. Extracting natural gas from shale, through a controversial process called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has created a drilling boom in the United States.
K.K.R. and TPG have benefited from the shale exploration boom in other areas of their private equity portfolios. K.K.R., for example, has had success investing in so-called shale plays. Beginning in 2009, the company placed two bets on natural gas exploration companies. It has since sold those investments, making billions in profit that offset the paper losses in Energy Future Holdings.
Those profits will not help the owners of Energy Future Holdings bonds, who would normally be among the first in line to recouping their investments in a restructuring. But given the company's dim prospects, even bondholders are worried. Mr. Buffett, the company's most prominent bondholder, said in his annual letter that unless gas prices rose substantially, the company's ability to pay interest on its bonds would soon be exhausted.
''Before the leveraged buyout, this was a highly profitable utility,'' said James Hempstead, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service. ''Five years later, the company finds itself in deep financial distress with an untenable capital structure. The game may not be over just yet, but the prospects don't look so good.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Snowe Opts Not to Seek Re-election In Maine

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Jonathan Weisman and Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Citing excessive partisanship and a dispiriting political environment, Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a three-term Republican from Maine, said Tuesday that she would not run for re-election in November. Her surprise decision delivered a potential blow to Republicans who need just a handful of seats to regain control of the Senate; Ms. Snowe was considered one of their safer incumbents.
''After 33 years in the Congress this was not an easy decision,'' said Ms. Snowe, 65, a moderate who served 16 years in the House before moving to the Senate. ''My husband and I are in good health. We have laid an exceptionally strong foundation for the campaign, and I have no doubt I would have won re-election.'' 
But in sharp comments citing the lack of comity in the current Congress as a motivating factor in her sudden retirement, Ms. Snowe, who spent a career voting against her Republican colleagues almost as often as with them, said she had had enough.
''I do find it frustrating,'' she said, ''that an atmosphere of polarization and 'my way or the highway' ideologies has become pervasive in campaigns and in our governing institutions.''
She added: ''Unfortunately, I do not realistically expect the partisanship of recent years in the Senate to change over the short term. So at this stage of my tenure in public service, I have concluded that I am not prepared to commit myself to an additional six years in the Senate, which is what a fourth term would entail.''
Ms. Snowe cast key votes on bills that were dear to Democrats, including the economic stimulus measure and a law upending the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy governing gay men and lesbians in the military. She was facing a Tea Party-backed challenger, but her opponent had failed to gain much traction in a state where Ms. Snowe was popular and had the backing of the new Republican governor.
Despite her reputation for crossing the aisle, Ms. Snowe stood firm against the health care overhaul in 2009, even though she had worked closely with Democrats on the issue for years. She complained that party leaders were ramming the measure through without offering sufficient chance to consider changes, and the experience colored her relationship with top Democrats.
Democrats in Washington immediately and gleefully cast their gaze north Tuesday, where a Maine victory that seemed unthinkable just a few hours earlier suddenly seemed possible. Representative Chellie Pingree, a Democrat widely expected to jump into the race, said in a statement, ''This upcoming election is critical to the future of our working families around the country, and in the coming days I will carefully consider how I can best serve the people of Maine.'' The filing date for the Maine primary is March 15, leaving new contenders little time.
Republicans said they were ready for the challenge. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement: ''While I would never underestimate the fight ahead in defending any open Senate seat, Republicans remain well positioned to win back a Senate majority in November.''
Maine has a quirky independent electoral flavor; it elected Paul R. LePage, a Tea Party-supported Republican, as governor in 2010 and has had two moderate Republican senators -- Ms. Snowe and Susan Collins -- for the last 15 years.
Ms. Snowe stands out in a body with relatively few women, her regal attire, tied-back hair and low and purposeful locution all signature trademarks. Over the years, she tussled with members of her own party, whom she often disappointed, and Democrats, with whom she just as often, and vehemently, disagreed.
As a longtime member of the Senate Finance Committee, Ms. Snowe frequently played a critical role in shaping tax legislation. In 2001, she helped trim President George W. Bush's initial $1.7 trillion, 10-year tax cut to $1.35 trillion.
After the 2010 elections, it appeared that Ms. Snowe could face a serious challenge from the right, but that threat had begun to fizzle. Last week, Andrew Ian Dodge, a Maine Tea Party leader, dropped out of the Republican primary contest; Scott D'Amboise, a businessman, remains in that race, but so far he has shown little fund-raising strength.

HEADLINE: Romney Regains Stride With Victories in 2 States

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Reporting was contributed by Steven Yaccino from Bloomfield Hills, Mich.; Michael Barbaro from Livonia, Mich.; and Marjorie Connelly and Allison Kopicki from New York.

 BODY:
SOUTHFIELD, Mich. -- Mitt Romney fought back a vigorous challenge from Rick Santorum in Michigan on Tuesday, narrowly carrying his native state, and won the Arizona primary in a pair of contests that reasserted his control over the Republican presidential race as it advances to critical Super Tuesday contests next week.
His victory over Mr. Santorum here in Michigan was far from commanding, but it was most likely sufficient to dampen the rising clamor from across the Republican Party about his ability to win over conservatives and connect with voters. The tussle with Mr. Santorum highlighted ample concerns about Mr. Romney, but his win spared his campaign from deep turmoil.
''I stand ready to lead our party to victory and our nation back to prosperity,'' Mr. Romney told a jubilant crowd of supporters. ''It's a critical time in America.'' 
The victory by Mr. Romney in Arizona, which awarded him the state's entire allotment of 29 delegates, was overshadowed by the battle in Michigan. He prevailed in the statewide popular vote by four percentage points, relying on large margins in the counties around Detroit where he spent his childhood, but the fight for delegates was closer.
Michigan awards its 30 delegates by Congressional district, which meant Mr. Santorum would either leave Michigan with nearly the same number as Mr. Romney or only slightly fewer. Mr. Santorum beamed when he took the stage before a cheering crowd in Grand Rapids and reminded his supporters of how far he had come.
''A month ago they didn't know who we are,'' Mr. Santorum said, moments after calling Mr. Romney to concede. ''They do now.''
As the Republican presidential nominating fight enters its third month, the race remains far from deciding the nominee who will challenge President Obama. A dozen primaries and caucuses will take place over the next week, dominated by Super Tuesday, when more than 400 delegates will be at stake.
Representative Ron Paul of Texas spoke Tuesday evening from Virginia, a state where only he and Mr. Romney qualified for the ballot next week. Having built an extensive network of supporters in caucus states, including several holding contests on Super Tuesday, Mr. Paul pledged to stay in the race, declaring that his campaign is ''still winning a lot of delegates, and that's what counts.''
Newt Gingrich, who did not actively campaign in Michigan or Arizona, is hoping to revive his candidacy next week in Georgia and Tennessee. His allies are airing a new ''super PAC'' television advertisement on his behalf starting Wednesday, aggressively taking on Mr. Romney across several Southern states.
It was not an overstatement -- at least in the view of many Republicans -- to say that Mr. Romney's candidacy was on the line in Michigan, far more than in the previous eight contests this year. He was born here, and his father, George, is fondly remembered for his service as governor nearly a half-century ago. Four years ago, Mr. Romney won the state by nine percentage points.
But after losing a string of contests to Mr. Santorum, Mr. Romney was hardly greeted with warmth and affection here. A place that his advisers hoped would offer an easy victory turned into a fierce battleground, with Mr. Santorum's popularity among social conservatives, as well as his working-class appeal, threatening to complicate Mr. Romney's path to the nomination.
The Republican electorate here, along with elsewhere across the country, is different from the one Mr. Romney encountered in 2008. His candidacy is facing tests that he did not go through during his first presidential bid.
In the primaries on Tuesday, the Romney campaign relied on the same coalition of voters who have consistently supported his candidacy during the seesawing series of Republican primaries and caucuses. He did best among older voters, better-educated voters and higher-income voters in Michigan and Arizona.
When Mr. Romney accepted victory, he kept his sights squarely on Mr. Obama. He did not mention Mr. Santorum or any of his rivals as he attempted to remind Republicans of his electability.
''Our campaign is about more than just replacing a president,'' Mr. Romney said. ''It's about restoring the promise of America.''
Against the backdrop of a slowly rebounding economy, the Michigan primary provided an early test of the challenges Republicans will face when they confront Mr. Obama in the fall. The revival of the automobile industry played a central role in the race, particularly the 2008 government rescue that Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum opposed.
The economy overwhelmed all other issues, according to surveys of primary voters in both Michigan and Arizona, with Mr. Romney winning by large margins among those who believe the issue was the most important. Voters who were looking primarily for a candidate who can beat Mr. Obama also gravitated to Mr. Romney, as did those who said experience was the most important candidate quality.
About 3 in 10 Michigan voters said someone in their household had lost a job in the last three years, according to surveys of voters conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool of television networks and The Associated Press.
As Mr. Romney and his family savored the victory on Tuesday evening, his advisers braced for another challenging stretch of contests next week, particularly in Tennessee, Georgia, Oklahoma and Ohio. His aides acknowledge that he will struggle to all of those states.
Mr. Romney, who has been beset by verbal missteps in recent weeks, accepted a share of blame for his struggle to make the case that he is the party's strongest prospective nominee, but he declared, ''I am who I am.''
''It's very easy to excite the base with incendiary comments,'' Mr. Romney told reporters before the polls closed. ''We've seen throughout the campaign that if you're willing to say really outrageous things that are accusatory and attacking President Obama that you're going to jump up in the polls.''
In Michigan, nearly 4 in 10 primary voters were white Christian evangelicals, according to the voter surveys, and about 3 in 10 were Catholic. Mr. Santorum made aggressive appeals to both groups.
Pat Tschirhart, 77, a Catholic who cast his ballot at a church in the Detroit suburb of Novi, said he sided with Mr. Santorum on many social issues -- most passionately abortion -- but had voted for Mr. Romney because he was the best ''anybody-but-Obama'' candidate.
Michigan does not identify voters by political party, so people who consider themselves independents and Democrats were free to participate in the primary. The rules created a stir, with Mr. Romney accusing Mr. Santorum of trying to ''kidnap our primary process'' by urging union members and Democrats to support Mr. Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania.
The surveys did not suggest that more Democrats voted in the Michigan primary this year. Interviews with voters, along with a telephone survey of those who cast absentee ballots, found that 1 in 10 said they usually identified as a Democrat. In 2008, 7 percent of voters in the Republican primary thought of themselves as Democrats, and in 2000, 17 percent did.
But Mr. Romney poured the full weight of his campaign into Michigan, hoping a victory would ease the qualms conservatives are openly expressing about his candidacy. The strategy was risky, particularly with the surging popularity of Mr. Santorum, but he and his advisers concluded that it was his only option.

HEADLINE: In Ohio, Santorum Tries to Widen Message While Keeping Base Excited

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE; Trip Gabriel reported from Perrysburg, and Katharine Q. Seelye from Kalamazoo, Mich.

 BODY:
PERRYSBURG, Ohio -- Even on primary day in Michigan, where he lost narrowly, Rick Santorum detoured into neighboring Ohio on Tuesday with an eye on an important state that votes next week on Super Tuesday.
Addressing an audience of several hundred in this town outside Toledo, Mr. Santorum covered a lot of ground: taxes, manufacturing, energy. At one point, he even tapped a black rock on the lectern to make a point about oil trapped in shale. ''This rock leaches oil,'' he said, accusing President Obama of delaying aggressive energy exploration.
But what really excited the audience was Mr. Santorum's appeal on social issues, including a revival of his recent salvos on college education and the separation of church and state. 
The voters' reaction demonstrates Mr. Santorum's challenge in the days ahead: He needs to keep the excitement in his base of social conservatives -- the evangelicals, anti-abortion activists and Tea Party members who support him fervently -- but he may not be able to win without expanding that base.
In Ohio, as in Michigan and elsewhere in the Rust Belt, the key to doing so probably lies in more focus on an economic message and a direct appeal to voters hit hard by the economic downturn.
Despite the loss in Michigan, the view inside the Santorum campaign is that he succeeded just by forcing Mitt Romney to sweat so much in his native state, spending dollars that might have been directed to Super Tuesday states. ''Our goal was to make this a two-person race and we've done that,'' said John Brabender, a top strategist for Mr. Santorum. ''It's a race that no one thought would be competitive and we're walking away with a lot of delegates.''
His aides argue that Mr. Santorum has begun to address the economy more directly, as he did at the Detroit Economic Club and before a Chamber of Commerce audience. His plan to revive manufacturing was aimed squarely at blue-collar voters with whom he believes he has an advantage, given his roots in a steel town in western Pennsylvania.
''In Ohio the issues are always jobs -- energy, jobs and manufacturing,'' said Mike DeWine, the state's attorney general, who recently switched his endorsement to Mr. Santorum from Mr. Romney.
''He hit that very strong today. That's a perfect message for Ohio,'' Mr. DeWine added, after campaigning with him in Perrysburg.
But, as The Wall Street Journal's conservative-friendly editorial page noted this month: ''Mr. Santorum often gives the impression that he views the economy as a secondary issue, something he'll get to after he saves the traditional family.''
Mr. Santorum's speech on Tuesday night -- not much of a concession speech -- could be seen as a road map of how he might adjust his candidacy now. In Michigan, he veered off into controversial positions that may have alienated some voters, particularly women, and he devoted part of his speech to his mother and wife. He said that both are strong women who balanced professional careers and motherhood, perhaps an attempt to quell some of the anger that arose recently over passages in his 2005 book that took working mothers to task for not staying home.
He also addressed the economy.
Mr. Romney, who has made his business acumen the centerpiece of his campaign, senses that the economy, which voters say is their most important issue, is a major Santorum weakness. On Tuesday he called him ''an economic lightweight.''
Mr. Santorum's passion in his campaign speeches is reserved for what he calls economic freedom -- from regulations and an intrusive government. That inevitably leads him to discuss President Obama and his health care law, a topic that gets Mr. Santorum's blood boiling, and that of his listeners.
His biggest applause lines are often his attacks on the president and his portrayal of Mr. Obama is an elitist, someone who ''knows better than you'' how to spend your money -- a portrayal that often fuels a sense of class warfare.
On the eve of Tuesday's primary, Mr. Santorum held a rally at a Christian academy in Kalamazoo, Mich., that had the feel of a revival meeting, especially as he railed against the president.
But Mr. Santorum was surely preaching to the converted. His loss in Michigan raises the possibility that he has hit a ceiling with Republican primary voters; he may even have damaged himself with some by a string of controversial comments, particularly his assertion that President Obama is a ''snob'' for advocating that every American have access to a college education.
Even some high-profile Republicans who have stayed neutral in the race noted that going to college had long been part of the American dream.
In some speeches, Mr. Santorum has portrayed an America in decline. He has been panned by some conservative pundits.
In a column this month in The New York Post, John Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary Magazine, called Mr. Santorum a ''sourpuss.''
''The former Pennsylvania senator looks like he swallowed a lemon -- and he acts like America is the lemon he swallowed,'' he wrote. ''There is no way that a man who expresses such a dark view of the American national character can win the presidency.''
But Mr. Santorum has proven, if nothing else, that he will continue in this Republican nominating battle. The question is whether people will see him as a ''sourpuss,'' or will see something else -- an alternative to Mr. Romney.
''The thing I've seen in Ohio in the last three or four months, they didn't know Santorum,'' Mr. DeWine said. ''People would come up to me and say, 'I like that Santorum guy. I saw him at a debate.' I think what Rick has going for him, the more people see him the more they like him. He wears on people well.''

HEADLINE: Stimulus Is Maligned, But Options Were Few

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
It was the winter of 2009 and the United States economy was shrinking. In the last three months of 2008 the economy had contracted at an annual rate of 8.9 percent, the sharpest decline in more than half a century. It shrank at a 6.9 percent rate the next quarter. By February 2009 the country had lost more than five million jobs.
We know what President Obama did. In February, he pushed Congress to pass the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, an $831 billion fiscal stimulus package aimed at creating demand for goods and services to reignite growth and stop the downward spiral.
Only three Republican senators voted for the bill -- Susan Collins, Olympia Snowe and Arlen Specter (who as a result of the vote had to change parties). Since then, Republicans have condemned the legislation as an unmitigated disaster. ''These policies have made our economic woes worse,'' the House speaker, John Boehner, wrote earlier this month on the third anniversary of the bill's enactment. They ''left millions of Americans out of work and made the future of job-crushing debt even more daunting for our children and grandchildren.'' 
The attack hardly fits an economy that appears finally to be gathering steam. By the end of last year the economy had recovered to its peak size in 2007, before the recession. Employment is growing at a steady, though modest, clip. The jobless rate is 8.3 percent, down from 10 percent at its peak in October 2009.
Perhaps more intriguingly, the Boehner attack suggests a question: Were there other plausible choices? And would they have fixed the economy sooner?''
Around the world, governments were trying to stimulate their economies at the time -- on the right as well as on the left, totalitarian autocracies and parliamentary democracies. By early 2009, China had announced stimulus policies amounting to 4.8 percent of its gross domestic product. The austere Germans put in place measures worth about 3.4 percent of their G.D.P. to bolster flagging demand. A study published by the New York Fed found the average fiscal stimulus in a group of some 40 developed and developing countries was slightly less than 3 percent of national output.
There were alternatives. After an initial experiment with government stimulus in 2009, many European countries reversed course and slashed their budgets to try to restore fiscal balance, in the expectation that this would reassure businesses and investors that government finances were under control, and give them the confidence to invest and bolster the economy. But so far, these policies have proved to be an unmitigated disaster.
Britain -- which has its own currency and enjoys low interest rates -- offers perhaps the best parallel to the United States. In 2010 the coalition government of David Cameron came into office promising to undo the stimulus policies of its predecessor. It cut spending across the board, asking government departments to slash budgets by 25 to 40 percent. And it shot Britain's incipient economic recovery in the foot.
By the end of last year the British economy was still 4 percent smaller than it was before the recession started four years earlier. And it is expected to contract a little more this year. Even after budget cuts, the government's debt is bigger, compared with the size of the economy, than when Mr. Cameron took office.
By comparison, despite criticism of its size and composition by both the right and the left, the stimulus by the Obama administration did add to jobs and growth. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates it will have contributed at least 1.6 million jobs and perhaps as many as 8.4 million by 2013.
This month, the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago surveyed a panel of economic experts of different political persuasions about the impact of the president's stimulus package: eight out of 10 said it had contributed to lower unemployment by the end of 2010. There was less consensus on whether its benefits would exceed its long-term costs, including higher taxes to pay for the spending. Still, when asked if the policy was worth it, four times as many economists agreed as disagreed.
Regarding the children crushed by debt, no plausible economic strategy would have kept the budget deficit from mushrooming. President Obama's fiscal stimulus package of February 2009 cost the equivalent of about 5 percent of the nation's yearly output, most of which was spent over four years. Wrapping in other attempts by the Obama administration to ignite demand -- from the payroll tax cut and extended unemployment assistance to the ''cash for clunkers'' program to encourage drivers to buy a fuel-efficient car -- the cost rises to some $1.25 trillion, which amounts, on average, to about 2.1 percent of the nation's annual output from 2009 through 2012.
While this is not cheap, it accounts for a small share of the budget deficit, which topped 10 percent of the country's G.D.P. in 2009 and remained at 8.7 percent last year, swollen by plummeting tax revenue and mandatory expenditures as the country sank into recession and unemployment surged.
Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard who has written extensively about financial crises and their aftermath, says he thinks it unlikely that an alternative path would have delivered a much better outcome. Given the heavy debt burden on American families, he says the pattern of low and volatile growth and the growing deficit ''would have happened under anyone.''
For sure, Republicans would have calibrated economic stimulus differently -- heavier on tax cuts and lighter on government spending. A Republican stimulus in 2009 might have been smaller; more focused on tax cuts and incentives for investment by business with less emphasis on extended unemployment insurance or transfers for struggling states.
These differences are not trivial. Chances are, the package would have delivered less bang for the buck. Most economists say they believe that tax cuts and rebates would have been less likely to generate new sales than direct government spending, because households swamped by debt were likely to save their windfall.
But it is easy to forget that Mr. Obama's stimulus wasn't the first. In early 2008 George W. Bush pushed a $170 billion package to prop up an economy already shrinking as the housing bubble deflated. The Bush administration also drafted the first $17.4 billion tranche of the bailout for General Motors and Chrysler, which is now maligned by the campaign of Mitt Romney as ''crony capitalism on a grand scale.'' Had John McCain rather than Barack Obama followed, chances are he would have opted to continue along that path.
Mr. Rogoff -- an accomplished chess player -- explains that there is a term in chess called an ''only move,'' a move forced by circumstance -- the only one available to avoid immediate defeat. The Obama administration's efforts to stimulate the sagging economy, he says, fit that description. It is unlikely that Republicans would have done much differently.
Republicans on the campaign trail are now vowing to undo President Obama's economic strategy, which they claim has done so much damage to the American economy, and return the country to immediate austerity. Mr. Romney, for instance, promises to reduce federal spending to 20 percent of the nation's output by 2016, down from about 24 percent today.
But it's hard to tell whether to believe this embrace of frugality. Responding to a question about the deficit during a campaign speech in Michigan last week, Mr. Romney pointed out: ''if all you're thinking about doing is cutting spending, as you cut spending you'll slow down the economy, so you have to create at the same time pro-growth tax policies.''
To figure out what his pro-growth policies might consist of, it's useful to turn to his track record as governor of Massachusetts: in 2005 Mr. Romney proposed a $600 million stimulus package to create 20,000 jobs over five years, at a cost of $30,000 a job. That sounds familiar.

HEADLINE: Europe Delays Debt Talks After Signs of Uncertain Support

BYLINE: By JACK EWING, STEPHEN CASTLE and MELISSA EDDY; Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, Stephen Castle from Brussels and Melissa Eddy from Berlin. Raphael Minder contributed reporting from Spain.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Domestic politics in euro zone countries emerged again on Tuesday as a serious obstacle to resolving the European debt crisis, contributing to a decision by officials to postpone a crucial meeting they had planned for Friday. The setbacks illustrated again how hard it has been to reconcile impatient financial markets with democratic processes.
Ireland said it would hold a referendum on an agreement to impose fiscal discipline on members of the euro zone. The prospect of more political turmoil seemed to unsettle investors, even though the country's approval is not needed for the accord to take effect. Irish voters have a history of rejecting European Union measures at the polls; the euro dropped after the news before recovering.
In Germany, the constitutional court issued a ruling on Tuesday that was likely to slow parliamentary approval of emergency measures in response to the debt crisis. The ruling came a day after members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's party rebelled against helping to pay for the latest plan to rescue Greece. 
At the meeting on Friday, European leaders planned to discuss building a stronger financial firewall to prevent debt problems in one country from spreading to others. The delay means a decision to increase the bailout fund is not likely to come until later in March. The meeting had been expected to take place after a summit meeting of all 27 European Union heads of government, which will still proceed.
Darkening the outlook, an official report highlighted how much risk remained in the euro zone. Portugal faces a sharp contraction this year as austerity measures take their toll, the International Monetary Fund said in an assessment of the country's progress in overcoming its debt and economic problems. The warning came a day after Spain said that its budget deficit last year was much larger than expected, highlighting how difficult it is to cut borrowing and restore economic growth simultaneously.
Leaders outside Europe, including Timothy F. Geithner, the United States Treasury secretary, have urged euro zone leaders to increase the firewall by hundreds of billions of euros, to at least a trillion euros, or nearly $1.35 trillion. But officials in Berlin say expanding the size of the fund could send a negative signal to financial markets while Greece is involved in a complicated bond swap. They contend that the move would sap confidence by implying that large countries like Italy or Spain were also at risk.
Other European leaders think the euro zone should take advantage of improved sentiment after the European Central Bank vastly expanded its low-cost loans to banks in recent months and officials made progress on a second Greek bailout. Increasing the firewall would restore confidence and help the euro zone emerge from an economic downturn, other leaders argue.
Still, the leaders decided it was not a good time to press Germany, said one official who was not authorized to speak publicly.
On Monday, the German Parliament approved its contribution to the latest Greek rescue package by an overwhelming majority, but 17 members of Mrs. Merkel's government voted against it and three abstained. That was a rebuke to Mrs. Merkel. German political parties expect loyalty from their members of Parliament. It is rare for them to vote against their own blocs.
Polls show that a large majority of Germans believe that attempts to save Greece are futile and a waste of their money -- a view shared by many professional economists.
''How long will countries like Greece endure reform policies that are in many respects illusory?'' the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper wrote in a front-page editorial on Tuesday. ''And how long will taxpayers in the donor countries be willing and able to finance such grand political-economic experiments?''
A euro zone official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said, ''Germany doesn't seem ready yet to swallow that pill, so it just made no sense to have a meeting that would put pressure on them.''
Irish voters would probably approve their country's participation in a euro zone fiscal discipline pact, approval that would be required were Ireland itself to need a second bailout. But the vote would be close, according to a poll cited by Reuters. Approval by at least 12 of the 17 countries in the euro zone would be needed for the pact to take effect.
In 2008, Ireland rejected the Lisbon Treaty, a measure to streamline the European Union's operations, but it later approved it after changes were made. It was not certain when the new vote would be held, but probably not for several months.
The European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, has called for the resources of a temporary bailout fund to be combined with that of a new permanent fund. The permanent fund would have 500 billion euros. The temporary fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, has about 250 billion euros, of which about 100 billion will probably be used to finance the latest bailout of Greece.
Finance ministers in the euro zone will meet on Thursday to decide whether to go ahead with the bailout, which depends on Greece's carrying out additional spending cuts and measures intended to make the economy function better.
Christine Lagarde, president of the International Monetary Fund, said last week that the scale of the I.M.F. contribution to the next Greek rescue would depend upon Europe's willingness to increase the firewall.
Germany's highest court ruled on Tuesday that Germany must convene all 620 members of its Parliament to approve most emergency measures to be taken by the euro zone's rescue fund. The court said a nine-member committee set up to approve urgent action by the bailout fund was ''in large part'' unconstitutional. The panel could authorize only some government bond purchases by the bailout fund, it said.
Andreas Vosskuhle, the lead presiding judge, said in a televised announcement of the court's decision that it was based on the need to guarantee ''as much parliamentary legitimization as possible.''
The ruling Tuesday does not affect any existing German decisions on aid for struggling euro zone partners, but it does mean that future approval may take longer and become more difficult.
''It demonstrates that the court remains a key hurdle with regard to the debt crisis,'' said Thomas Costerg, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank. ''There is a dilemma between the need for democratic accounting and the need for efficiency and speed: gathering the Parliament for each E.F.S.F. money disbursement is quite cumbersome.''
In an update on Portugal's progress, a team from the I.M.F., as well as the European Commission and the European Central Bank, praised the country's progress in cutting its deficit, strengthening its banks and deregulating the labor market. But they warned that the economy was likely to contract 3.25 percent this year after falling 1.5 percent in 2011. In a statement, they said Portugal still needed to do more to remove impediments to growth, like dismantling quasi cartels that raise prices for local services.
''Portugal is making good progress toward adjusting its economic imbalances,'' the three institutions said in the statement. ''Determined implementation of reforms remains key to ensure economic recovery and fiscal sustainability.''
Like all of the troubled countries, Portugal is trying to restore economic growth while sharply cutting government spending. On Monday, Spain reported that its budget deficit in 2011 was 8.5 percent of gross domestic product, much higher than had been expected, largely because regional governments did not meet their spending goals.
The European Commission indicated Tuesday that it was unlikely to relax financial targets for Spain despite news that the country was falling behind.
''We are not talking about giving flexibility,'' Olivier Bailly, a spokesman for the European Commission, said Tuesday, adding that member states needed to ''maintain commitments.''
In a bit of encouraging news, the European Commission's economic sentiment indicator, released Tuesday, rose in February to its highest level since October. The data suggested that an economic downturn that began in the euro zone at the end of 2011 could end soon. But there remains a large gap between northern Europe and troubled countries like Greece, Portugal and Italy.
The sentiment indicator ''confirms our expectation that the economic divide between the euro zone countries will remain substantial in 2012,'' Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank, wrote Tuesday in a note to clients.

HEADLINE: Obama Revs Up Oratory, Reminding Autoworkers of Bailout

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama channeled his 2008 campaign persona on Tuesday, using an energetic speech before the United Auto Workers conference to remind Michigan on primary day that he helped save the auto industry with a controversial bailout even as Mitt Romney was calling for the leading car companies to seek bankruptcy.
''Just a few years ago, nearly one in five autoworkers were handed a pink slip,'' Mr. Obama said in a full-bore address filled with applause lines for a core Democratic constituency. ''And as the financial crisis hit with its full fury, America faced a hard and once unimaginable reality: two of the Big Three -- GM and Chrysler -- were on the brink of failure.'' 
And then, he gleefully got to the punch line that he has been perfecting ever since the Republican campaign road show headed to Michigan, where Mr. Romney has been trying to live down the infamous Op-Ed article headlined ''Let Detroit Go Bankrupt'' that he wrote in The New York Times in 2008.
''Some politicians,'' Mr. Obama said, ''even said we should 'let Detroit go bankrupt!' '' The crowd booed, and Mr. Obama paused, dramatically, then added, ''You remember that?''
There were more boos; the president was clearly enjoying himself.
''Think about what that choice would have meant for this country, if we had turned our backs on you, if America had thrown in the towel. GM and Chrysler wouldn't exist today.''
Mr. Obama, when he chooses to and as he did consistently in 2008 during his initial run for president, can turn up the oratory. And he has carefully chosen his spots in recent months to make sure he shared in the news coverage devoted to the Republican presidential race.
The autoworkers and labor union leaders in the crowd were eating up every word -- and their energy appeared to amp up Mr. Obama further. The president fed them one line after another, and several times detoured from his prepared remarks, as when he gave an endorsement for the new Chevy Volt that included a promise to buy one -- in five years' time, of course.
''I got to sit in a Chevy Volt, even though Secret Service wouldn't let me drive it,'' Mr. Obama said, to cheers. ''I enjoyed sitting in it. And four or five years from now, when I'm not president no more and I can drive myself, I'm going to buy one.'' For that, he got a chant of ''Four more years!''
Mr. Obama never mentioned Mr. Romney by name, but his allusions were obvious. ''It's been fun watching these folks trying to completely rewrite history now that you're back on your feet,'' he told the autoworkers.
He went into a long riff about the hard labors of union workers, and sought to turn his rivals' rhetoric about American values against the Republican Party. ''Let me tell you, I keep hearing people talk about values all the time,'' Mr. Obama said, his voice rising. ''Hard work, that's a value.''
Mr. Obama even channeled Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who died in 2009. ''He used to say, 'What is it about working men and women they find so offensive?' '' the president recalled.
Responding to Mr. Obama's speech, Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, countered in a statement that ''President Obama is known for putting his re-election over keeping his promises to the American people.''
Ms. Kukowski called Tuesday's speech ''an insider deal for his union cronies who got billions in bailout money and are now backing Obama's re-election campaign.''

HEADLINE: Senate Nears Showdown On Contraception Policy

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Tuesday headed toward a showdown over President Obama's policy requiring health insurance coverage of contraceptives for women, even as Republicans appeared to be divided over the wisdom of pressing for a vote any time soon.
Senate Republican leaders sought an immediate vote on legislation to overturn the president's policy and allow a broad exemption for certain insurers and employers that have religious or moral objections to such coverage. 
But other Republicans said that the party had other priorities and that they wanted more information about how the new requirement would work.
''I don't know where we are going with this issue,'' said Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska.
Ms. Murkowski said she did not want a vote on the issue this week. ''We've got way too much else to be doing,'' Ms. Murkowski said, adding that her constituents were more concerned about energy policy.
The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, announced that the Senate would vote on the issue on Thursday.
The proposal, offered by Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, as an amendment to a highway bill, says that health insurance plans and employers may refuse to provide or pay for coverage of ''specific items or services'' if the coverage would be ''contrary to the religious beliefs or moral convictions of the sponsor, issuer or other entity offering the plan.''
Mr. Reid denounced the proposal, saying it ''would allow any employer anywhere in our country to deny coverage for virtually any health service for virtually any reason.''
The 2010 health care law requires most insurers to cover preventive services without co-payments or deductibles. Under the administration policy, most health plans must cover birth control for women -- all contraceptive drugs and devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration -- as well as sterilization procedures.
Church-affiliated universities, hospitals and charities would not have to provide or pay for such coverage. Instead, the White House says, coverage for birth control could be offered to women directly by their employers' insurance companies, ''with no role for religious employers who oppose contraception.''
Mr. Blunt said, ''The president's so-called compromise is nothing more than an accounting gimmick.''
Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said that before voting on Mr. Blunt's proposal, she wanted the administration to explain how its policy would work for ''self-insured faith-based institutions.''
Such institutions, including many Roman Catholic hospitals, ''act as both the employer and the insurer,'' Ms. Collins said.
More than 20 national organizations weighed in on Tuesday against Mr. Blunt's proposal. The groups include the March of Dimes, Easter Seals, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
Under Mr. Blunt's proposal, they said in a letter to lawmakers, ''a small employer or health plan could ban maternity care for women due to religious convictions regarding out-of-wedlock pregnancies.'' Likewise, they said, a health plan or a small employer that objects to childhood immunizations or screening of newborns for genetic disorders could deny coverage for those services.
More than 200 House members have signed up as co-sponsors of the House version of Mr. Blunt's proposal. But Representative Judy Biggert, Republican of Illinois, said lawmakers should focus on the economy and job creation, ''instead of getting sidetracked by issues that can divide us.''
House Republican leaders plan to emphasize that the requirement for contraceptive coverage is traceable to the health care overhaul championed by Mr. Obama -- an initiative that they believe is unpopular with independent voters in battleground states.
Representative Ann Marie Buerkle, Republican of New York, who is a nurse and a health care lawyer, said Democrats portrayed the president's directive as a question of contraception or women's health.
But she said she saw it in broader terms, as ''a violation of conscience, a fundamental assault on First Amendment rights.''
Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, said she was dismayed that ''we have to have a vote on birth control'' to move forward on a transportation bill.
''We're supposed to be on the highway bill, which will protect 1.8 million jobs and create an additional million jobs,'' Mrs. Boxer said. ''So 2.8 million jobs are hanging in the balance.''

HEADLINE: Projects to Add Wind Power for City Gain Momentum

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Despite Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's long-expressed dream of putting wind turbines on skyscrapers and bridges, the constraints of an urban landscape have so far proved too challenging for reliable wind power in the city, energy experts said. As a result, New York City has been largely inactive -- and behind the national curve -- in embracing wind power.
But that is about to change. This spring, the city's Department of Environmental Protection will solicit plans for the first major wind project, the installation of turbines atop the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island. And city planners are working on zoning changes, now under review by the City Planning Commission, to allow turbines up to 55 feet high on the rooftops of buildings taller than 100 feet, and even taller turbines on commercial and industrial sites along the waterfront.
But the biggest potential for supplying wind power to the city lies offshore, where the Bloomberg administration is supporting an application filed last September by a coalition led by the New York Power Authority to lease a swath of the ocean floor for a wind farm 13 miles off the coast of the Rockaways in Queens. 
City officials say they are ready to take advantage of their coastal proximity to seek bigger renewable-energy projects and quicken the pace toward cleaner air and the jobs and economic benefits that would accompany those projects. A study commissioned by the city last year said wind farms could play a major role in replacing power now generated by the Indian Point nuclear power plant in Westchester County. The plant supplies up to 25 percent of consumption in Consolidated Edison's service area, including New York City.
''When you're talking about huge wind, offshore is really a unique opportunity,'' said Farrell Sklerov, a spokesman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection.
The proposal for the offshore wind farm, which is scheduled for a public hearing before the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management next month, is considered a game changer in that it would start at 350 megawatts but have the potential to double its capacity -- eventually generating enough electricity to power a half-million homes in New York City and Long Island.
The plans are in the initial stages, but they are part of a push by states along the Eastern Seaboard to make wind power a significant staple of their energy mix. The region lags behind the West and Midwest, where flat, open spaces are plentiful and wind turbines already supply up to 20 percent of electric power in some states.
''We certainly have an ocean in our backyard that can host these turbines,'' said Katherine Kennedy, clean-energy counsel at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''If we can develop wind and solar, all of a sudden we look like a European city.''
Through most of the last decade, turbines have been springing up all over the country, including in dairy farms in upstate New York. As a result, New York State, which has set a goal of deriving 30 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2015, now ranks 12th among the states in wind power installations, with 1,400 megawatts, or enough to meet 2 percent of the state's electricity demand, says the American Wind Energy Association, a trade group.
Some states got a lift this month when federal officials from the Department of the Interior cleared the way for companies to seek federal leases in wind-energy areas off New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, speeding the process to approve wind projects.
Environmental groups say New York has been less focused on tapping into wind than some of these neighboring states but this year the New York Department of State is expected to identify the most viable locations for offshore wind farms with an eye toward protecting shipping, commercial fishing and ocean habitats -- an approach that experts say should save time and red tape and help attract developers looking to begin such a project.
Long processes to win approvals and the higher cost of wind compared with less sustainable sources of electricity are not the only obstacles to developing wind installations. The projects must also withstand public scrutiny. Despite support from environmental groups, the only federally approved offshore wind project to date, Cape Wind in Nantucket Sound off the coast of Cape Cod, has been stalled, in part by opposition over aesthetics and the impact on American Indian artifacts and burial grounds, among other issues.
Bonnie Brady, executive director of the Long Island Commercial Fishing Association, opposed a proposed wind farm three-and-a-half to five miles off Jones Beach in Long Island over concerns about the potential harm to fish. The project was ultimately derailed in 2007 by high costs. Ms. Brady said the proposal off the Rockaways, while farther offshore, was still worrisome. It calls for at least 70 wind turbines that could each soar 430 feet above the water.
''The biggest problem we have is that there's really no science to either support or negate wind power as something that wouldn't affect the fish negatively,'' she said. ''If there's a problem, once you've done the damage, who's responsible?''
While more expensive to produce than wind power, solar energy is more suited to cities, energy experts said, because it can be harnessed more discreetly from thousands of rooftops. New York City has so far grown its solar production to seven megawatts, a modest amount but well over its practically nonexistent wind production. This runs counter to what is occurring in the rest of the state and the country, where wind installed capacity, 46,000 megawatts, vastly outpaces the 3,800 megawatts of solar.
Some New York buildings are already experimenting with private wind production, like the Eltona apartments in the Melrose section of the Bronx. But they have found that they do not get enough wind to make turbines a reliable source of power. City planners are revising zoning regulations to allow more private turbines, but still concede that wind turbines may not thrive here unless they are on or near the shore.
City officials say the former environmental wasteland known as Fresh Kills is an ideal location. The Department of Environmental Protection will, in the next two months, ask for wind and solar proposals to develop 75 acres of the landfill, with the goal of adding 15 megawatts of energy, enough to power 3,300 homes. Officials said at least a third of the production would be wind power.
The Fresh Kills plan could double the city's solar output, but it is the wind turbines that excite the Staten Island borough president, James P. Molinaro, who has lobbied for a wind farm for years, and persuaded the state to finance a study that showed the site could support seven 400-foot turbines.
City officials say it has taken them this long to evaluate the challenges of installing wind turbines on the landfill's unique subsurface.
Fresh Kills closed as a landfill handling the city's residential garbage more than a decade ago and is now undergoing a transformation into a 2,200-acre park.
''It'd change the biggest tragedy that ever happened to Staten Island and convert it to something wonderful,'' Mr. Molinaro said. ''Windmills that would give us clean energy in a beautiful park. It'd be a model for the rest of the world to look at.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Greek Tragedy

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
Rick should scat.
Mitt Romney needs to be left alone to limp across the finish line, so he can devote his full time and attention to losing to President Obama.
With Sanctorum and Robo-Romney in a race to the bottom, the once ruthless Republican Party seems to have pretty much decided to cave on 2012 and start planning for a post-Obama world.
Not even because Obama is so strong; simply because their field is so ridiculously weak and wacky. 
John McCain has Aeschylated it to ''a Greek tragedy.'' And he should know from Greek tragedy.
''It's the negative campaigning and the increasingly personal attacks,'' he told The Boston Herald, adding, ''the likes of which we have never seen.'' When a man who was accused of having an illegitimate black child in the 2000 South Carolina primary thinks this is the worst ever, the G.O.P. is really in trouble.
The Arizona senator, who's supporting Romney, grimly noted: ''I know he's going to be the nominee, but I also worry about how much damage has been done.''
As they battled for Michigan, Arizona and beyond, Romney called Rick Santorum an ''economic lightweight,'' and Santorum called Romney ''a lightweight on conservative accomplishments,'' ''uniquely unqualified'' and ''a bully.''
In the old days, the Republican ego had control of the party's id. The id, sometimes described as a galloping horse or crying baby, ''the dark, inaccessible part of our personality ... chaos, a cauldron full of seething excitations,'' as Freud called it, was whipped up obliquely by candidates. Nixon had his Southern strategy of using race as a wedge, Bush Senior and Lee Atwater used the Willie Horton attack, and W. and Karl Rove conjured the gay marriage bogyman.
Once elected, those presidents curbed the id with the ego, common sense and reason. But now the G.O.P.'s id is unbridled. The horse has thrown the rider; the dark forces are bubbling. Moderates, women, gays, Hispanics and blacks -- even the president -- are being hunted in this most dangerous game.
Asked in Michigan why he couldn't excite the base, Romney said he is not willing to make ''incendiary comments'' or ''light my hair on fire.''
In the latest sign that moderate Republicans feel passe, Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine shockingly announced her retirement, decrying '' 'my way or the highway' ideologies'' and a vanishing political center.
The apogee of apathy for Romney was on Friday, when the man who says he's an expert manager spoke to a mostly empty football stadium in Detroit. Stephen Colbert defended Romney, saying he connected with the sea of empty chairs because they, too, were ''plastic and uncomfortable.''
Some Republicans at the annual winter governors' meeting here murmured that it was over for Mittens even before he cited his wife's two Caddies and his Nascar team-owner pals, and awkwardly mocked the plastic ponchos of Daytona racing fans: ''I like those fancy raincoats you bought. Really sprung for the big bucks.''
They said Mitt was damaged as a contender against Obama when he was forced to admit that he had a 15-percent tax rate (given, as The Huffington Post points out, that Romney averaged $6,400 an hour at Bain Capital while creating lots of jobs with paltry wages).
Romney defended himself in an interview to Fox News on Tuesday, sitting in front of a poster of his dad with the slogan: ''Romney Great in '68.'' Romney pere lost his dream of becoming president when he claimed he was brainwashed on Vietnam.
Now Santorum should forfeit his chance after making a far dumber remark: Kids should beware of college because they'll get brainwashed.
Pandering to Tea Partiers, Santorum, who has a B.A., M.B.A. and J.D., and who supported higher education in his 2006 senatorial campaign, absurdly turned the American dream inside-out and into sauerkraut.
He called the president ''a snob'' for encouraging people to get more educated and asserted that Obama only wants Americans to go to college so they can be remade in his image, while being indoctrinated by liberal college professors.
Does he think that defining ambition down and asking kids to give up hope is a good mantra? Even Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia, who was trying to mandate that women seeking abortions be shamed with vaginal ultrasounds that Democrats dubbed ''legal rape,'' thought Santorum went too far.
As Mitt's remarks get curiouser, Rick's get creepier.
In an interview with ABC News's George Stephanopoulos, Santorum offended the Catholics he's courting by saying that the J.F.K. speech ratifying the separation of church and state made him want ''to throw up'' because Kennedy had thrown ''his faith under the bus.''
''I don't believe in an America where the separation of church and state are absolute,'' Sanctorum said.
If he is willing to cross that line, the only two possibilities are that he doesn't understand the nature of the United States or that he wants to do damage to the United States. Neither is acceptable.

HEADLINE: Many Cast Vote With November in Mind; for Others, Character Rates High

BYLINE: By DALIA SUSSMAN

 BODY:
Polls of voters in Tuesday's presidential primary in Michigan highlight the deep tension underpinning the Republican nominating contest, with Mitt Romney holding steady as the most electable candidate while Rick Santorum waged a serious challenge with a strong conservative base.
A majority of voters in Michigan said Mr. Romney was the candidate most likely to defeat President Obama, while just a quarter chose Mr. Santorum, according to exit poll results. But electability was not as great a factor for Michigan voters as it had been for voters in Nevada and Florida, where Mr. Romney won handily, or in South Carolina, where voters preferred Newt Gingrich. 
About a third of Michigan primary voters said electability was the top quality they were looking for in a candidate, and about 2 in 10 were looking for someone with the right experience -- both strong groups for Mr. Romney. But Mr. Santorum countered with solid support from voters looking for someone with a strong moral character (about one-fourth) and those seeking a true conservative (about one in six). Mr. Romney trailed among groups that had posed problems for him in some earlier contests, including very conservative voters and strong Tea Party supporters.
Still, Mr. Romney ran strongly among groups that he has tended to attract, including older voters and higher-income residents. In Michigan, those who are 65 and older made up about a quarter of the electorate, an increase from 16 percent in 2008.
As has been the case in every contest with exit polls so far this year, the top issue was the economy. More than half of the voters in Michigan chose the economy as their most important issue, while about a quarter cited the federal budget deficit. Mr. Romney won nearly half of these voters.
Although far fewer voters placed abortion highest, about one in seven, Mr. Santorum drew about three-fourths of their votes.
Democrats and independents were allowed to participate in Michigan's Republican primary, yielding a somewhat different electorate than in previous contests. About 6 in 10 said they were Republican, the fewest so far except in New Hampshire. About 3 in 10 were independents, while almost 10 percent -- the most in any nominating contest to date -- said they were Democrats.
Some had encouraged Democrats to try to influence the primary outcome, including Mr. Santorum's campaign, which used automated calls to urge Democrats to cast a vote against Mr. Romney. Exit poll results did not show much effect; Democratic turnout differed little from four years ago, when it accounted for 7 percent of the state's Republican primary voters. And it was far lower than the 17 percent in 2000.
But Mr. Santorum did succeed in pulling Democratic votes his way. Most Democratic voters voted for Mr. Santorum, far outpacing Democratic support for any other candidate.
While Republican voters preferred Mr. Romney, independents were closely divided between the top two candidates. About 6 in 10 Michigan voters described themselves as conservative, including about 3 in 10 who said they were very conservative -- up somewhat from 2008. Mr. Santorum won strong conservatives, who did not favor Mr. Romney in several other states, including Florida, Iowa and South Carolina.
About a quarter of Michigan voters said it mattered a great deal that a candidate shared their religious beliefs. They strongly favored Mr. Santorum, although Mr. Romney won considerable support from Catholic women.
In a state with one of the highest union membership rates in the country, almost one-fourth said they or someone in their household belonged to a labor union. These voters leaned toward Mr. Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania who tried to appeal to blue-collar workers.
Voters in Michigan were a bit more apt to say they disapproved of the government's bailout to United States automakers a few years ago. Opponents of the aid were closely divided between Mr. Santorum and Mr. Romney.
Compared with Michigan, the Arizona electorate is more Republican, conservative and supportive of the Tea Party movement. Yet Mr. Santorum did less well among these groups than he did in Michigan. Mr. Romney won in Arizona among men and women and across all age groups, education levels and income groups.
About one in seven voters in Arizona were Mormon, helping to lift Mr. Romney there. More than 9 in 10 Mormon voters supported him.
About one in eight Arizona voters called illegal immigration their top issue, more than in any other contest where exit polls have asked about it. Still, many more cited the economy, making it voters' top issue in Arizona as well.
Arizona voters were divided over what to do with illegal immigrant workers. About a third said they should be deported, and as many said they should be offered a chance at citizenship. Nearly 3 in 10 said they should be allowed to stay as temporary workers.
The polls, conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of the television networks and The Associated Press, include interviews with voters as they were leaving polling places across Michigan and Arizona and telephone interviews with early and absentee voters in each state.

HEADLINE: Sorting Through the Aftermath of Private Equity Deals

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: DealBook examines the myths surrounding the private equity industry by revisiting the aftermath of the top 10 leveraged buyout deals. 

 BODY:
Characterized as job-killers or a vital funding source for struggling business, private equity firms are often described through the prism of a self-selected group. Critics point to a deal where workers were laid off and companies were saddled with debt. The buyout industry's lobbying group rebuts with a list of success stories.
Below, we examine the myths surrounding private equity by revisiting the top 10 leveraged buyout deals. 
 Many of the deals share some common traits. Eight of the buyouts occurred between 2006 and 2007, when a wave of private equity encouraged comparisons to the takeover of RJR Nabisco chronicled in "Barbarians at the Gate." And six of the companies were bought by the powerful firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Since deal-making slowed after the financial crisis, it may be some time before a new buyout breaks into the list below. The biggest buyout in 2011 was for $7.2 billion, much less than the $21 billion deal made in 2005 for the paper giant Georgia-Pacific.
1. TXU
THE DEAL: Investors, led by the private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and TPG, formerly the Texas Pacific Group, bought TXU, the largest power generator in Texas, in 2007. Despite calls for regulating greenhouse gases, TXU has been the most aggressive in the power industry in pushing coal. Critics said that the sale would lead to higher prices for users to pay off $24.5 billion in new debt that the buyers put on TXU. Company officials responded that they would cut electric rates by 5 percent on top of an earlier 10 percent reduction. TXU had a profit of $2.6 billion on revenue of $10.8 billion in 2006. The company had 7,262 employees. Read more 
THE AFTERMATH: Concerns about higher prices proved unwarranted. The company, renamed Energy Future Holdings, has struggled with record low natural gas prices and its retail business has lost customers to cheaper rivals. The energy giant reported a 2011 loss of $1.9 billion on revenue of $7 billion. The company's debt load is $35 billion. Energy Future Holdings' staff has increased to 9,300 workers. Read more 
2. Equity Office Properties
THE DEAL: A fierce buyout battle called "New York at the Gate" pitted Stephen A. Schwarzman of Blackstone, a leading figure in Manhattan's financial and charity circuit, and Steven Roth of Vornado, the onetime strip mall king of New Jersey. Blackstone won the 2006 bidding war, paying almost $39 billion for the portfolio of 573 properties owned by the Chicago real estate mogul Sam Zell. Read more 
THE AFTERMATH: Blackstone immediately flipped hundreds of the buildings for $27 billion. When the commercial real estate market went bust, the companies that bought the buildings were stuck with debt and office space they could not fill. Read more 
3. HCA
THE DEAL: The nation's largest commercial hospital chain agreed to sell itself in 2006 to three private equity firms (Bain Capital, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Merrill Lynch's buyout unit) and the family of Senator Bill Frist, then the Senate majority leader. Although HCA had strong cash flow, patient admissions were essentially flat and there was a rise in the number of people without insurance who failed to pay their bills. HCA had profit of $1.4 billion on revenue of $24.4 billion in 2005. The company had about 191,100 employees. Read more 
THE AFTERMATH: The leveraged buyout of the hospital operator is widely regarded as one of the more successful of the credit boom. HCA went public last year and reported $7.77 billion in revenue and $1.94 billion in earnings in the fourth-quarter after a rise in admissions, continued cost-cutting and the acquisition of a Denver-area hospital firm. The company still has $27 billion in debt, but it is paying dividends to shareholders. HCA had profit of $2.5 billion on revenue of $29.7 billion in 2011 and about 194,000 employees. Read more 
4. RJR Nabisco
THE DEAL: In one of the most confusing and intense takeover battles, a much smaller Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company claimed victory in the 1988 contest for RJR Nabisco. A group led by RJR Nabisco's top executives said it had bid more but had been cheated by an unfair bidding process. Read more 
THE AFTERMATH: The great leveraged buyout on Wall Street had a lackluster finale. RJR Nabsico went public in 1991 and the the shares soon declined. In 1995, Kohlberg Kravis traded its stake for ownership of Borden, a dairy and chemical company. The company was whittled down and its remnants were sold to Apollo Management for $649 million. RJR Nabisco was broken up and Kohlberg Kravis promised never again to put such a large part of a fund into one investment. Read more 
5. Harrah's Entertainment
THE DEAL: Leon Black, the enigmatic founder of the Apollo Group, and the Texas Pacific Group acquired Harrah's Entertainment, the world's largest casino company, in a 2006 deal that included the assumption of $10.7 billion in debt. Harrah's Entertainment had profit of $236 million on revenue of $7.1 billion in 2005. The company had approximately 30,440 employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. Read more 
THE AFTERMATH: By June 2007, the company reported that long-term debt had swelled to $23.9 billion. After the housing collapse, the gambling industry slumped. Harrah's cut staff and scaled back costs. In 2010, the casino operator withdrew its filing for an I.P.O. after prospective investors said the company was not worth what its owners claimed. Harrah's Entertainment lost $831 million that year on revenue of $8.8 billion. Read more 
6. Clear Channel Communication
THE DEAL: The outdoor advertiser and the nation's No. 1 network of radio stations, including Z100 in New York and KIIS-FM in Los Angeles, agreed to be acquired in 2006 by Thomas H. Lee Partners and Bain Capital in the largest buyout ever in the media and entertainment industry. Bain Capital was drawn to the rich cash flows generated by Clear Channel and undaunted by slow growth and regulatory concerns. The private equity firms had to go to court to force the banks to complete the deal. Clear Channel had profit of $936 million on revenue of $6.6 billion in 2005. The company had approximately 30,900 employees. Read more 
THE AFTERMATH: Revenue and cash flow are plunging, making it harder to meet the payments on $19.9 billion in long-term debt. The company has laid off more than 8,000 people. In 2011, Clear Channel lost $302 million on revenue of $6.2 billion. Read more 
6. First Data
THE DEAL: The First Data Corporation, which processes credit and debit card payments, agreed to a takeover by Kohlberg Kravis in 2007. First Data had profit of $1.51 billion on revenue of $7.08 billion in 2006. The company had about 27,000 employees. Read more 
THE AFTERMATH: In the latest earnings report from Kohlberg Kravis, the company's value had dropped 40 percent. Its payroll is now abut 24,500. In 2009, the the Internal Revenue Service widened its investigation of offshore tax evasion to include services sold by the First Data. Read more 
6. Kinder Morgan
THE DEAL: One of the largest pipeline operators in the country agreed to a sweetened buyout offer in 2006 from a group of investors led by its chairman and co-founder, Richard D. Kinder. Shareholders sued, saying Richard D. Kinder didn't tell his own board about his buyout plan until it was nearly complete. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, went from advising the company to becoming part of the buying group with Mr. Kinder. Kinder Morgan had profit of $812 million on revenue of $9.8 billion in 2005. The company had 8,481 employees. Read more 
THE AFTERMATH: In 2011, the oil pipeline firm was taken public in the largest private equity-backed initial public offering in American history. The company later agreed to buy the El Paso Corporation. El Paso shareholders sued, saying Goldman should not have advised both sides of this latest deal. Kinder Morgan had profit of $1.2 billion last year on revenue of $8.2 billion. The company has approximately 8,000 employees. Read more 
9. Alliance Boots
THE DEAL: The British pharmacy chain approved a takeover bid in 2007 from Stefano Pessina, its deputy chairman, and Kohlberg Kravis, after a bidding war with an investor group led by Terra Firma Capital Partners. Read more 
THE AFTERMATH: Bankers for Alliance Boots pulled 5 billion ($10.2 billion) in loan sales from the market to fuel the buyouts. Read more 
10. Georgia-Pacific
THE DEAL: The paper giant that makes Dixie cups and Brawny paper towels agreed to be sold in 2005 to Koch Industries, a family-controlled conglomerate that became the nation's largest privately held company. David Koch and his brother Charles, both No. 5 in Forbes's list of the richest Americans, are known for their family's contributions to conservative causes. In 2004, Georgia Pacific had profit of $623 million on revenue of $19.6 billion. Koch executives said they did not plan to lay off any of the company's 55,000 workers. Read more 
THE AFTERMATH: In 2011, Koch Industries sold the European tissue business of Georgia-Pacific for $1.8 billion. The unit had about 5,000 workers. The remaining company now has about 40,000 employees. Read more

HEADLINE: Prizes With an Eye Toward the Future

BYLINE: TINA ROSENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: When it comes to finding solutions to critical problems, cash prizes have been effective for centuries. 

 BODY:
Last week, David Bornstein wrote about how the Obama administration is using prize competitions to solve some of the problems government faces. Agencies as different as the Department of Labor and NASA are recruiting ideas from the public by offering prizes for solving challenges.
While solutions these prizes generate are often innovative, the practice of offering them is anything but new. In 1714, the British government offered a prize of 20,000 to the person who found a way to accurately determine a ship's longitude. As described in the book "Longitude," the Yorkshire carpenter and clockmaker John Harrison won the prize after decades of work by inventing a clock that worked at sea. Harrison's solution revolutionized the maritime world.
Charles Lindbergh won the $25,000 Orteig prize for making the first nonstop flight from New York to Paris. Canned goods, margarine, the commercial hydraulic turbine, machines to saw marble, fire extinguishers and thousands of other products were invented in response to prize challenges.
Prizes for the solution of a specific challenge have spurred innovation for centuries - hundreds of them are listed in this paper by Knowledge Ecology International, a Washington-based group that campaigns for managing knowledge equitably. Prizes were so important that in the mid-1800s that there was a serious campaign in the United States to replace the patent system with prizes, a proposalendorsed by the New York Times editorial page several times during the early 1850s.

Prizes began to fall out of favor in the late 1800s, says Karim Lakhani, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School who studies prizes; that era saw the rise of research labs and companies deciding that they could handle innovation in-house, with Bell Labs becoming the model. Today, the best-known prizes are those awarded not to stimulate innovation towards a specific goal, but for past achievement, like the Nobel Prize.
Now prizes that look to the future are back. A report by the consulting firm McKinsey found that before 1991, 97 percent of the prize money offered took the form of prizes for past achievements. Since then, 78 percent of new prize money has been offered for the future solution of problems. It is being offered by corporations, governments and especially nonprofit groups, which now make up the largest source of prize capital.
The change has come in part because of a flood of new philanthropic money (a lot of it from the tech sector) wielded by people looking for different ways of doing things, and because of a growing impatience with the limitations of in-house research and development and giving grants. The world brain pool has also never been larger. Not only are there more people than ever with educations, especially scientific or technical educations, but the walls that used to divide smart people have broken down - Russian and East Bloc, Indian and Chinese scientific minds now work with scientists in the West.
One example of the classic pay-for-success model is the Ansari X Prize, introduced in 1996, which offered $10 million to the builder of a private reusable passenger spacecraft that could go into space and land back on Earth safely twice in 10 days. Mojave Aerospace Ventures claimed the prize in 2004. The prize helped spawn a new industry in commercial space travel. The X-Prize foundation now offers similar prizes for other achievements. If you know how to build a car that gets 100 miles per gallon, or can design a rover that sends back pictures from the moon, get in touch.
Another model combines smaller prizes for promising ideas with big prizes for success. The Gates Foundation's Grand Challenges Explorations initiative, for example, gives out $100,000 grants for interesting but unusual ideas for solving health problems the foundation sets out: like finding cellphone-based ways to increase vaccination rates, or creating the next generation of sanitation technologies. Entrants need only submit a two-page write-up of an idea. The money finances research, and if a project succeeds, it can win a prize of up to $1 million. Since 2008, the foundation has awarded prizes to 602 researchers in 44 countries.
Another big impulse toward prizes comes from the rise of new forms of collaboration and new marketplaces on the Internet. What eBay does for buyers and sellers, companies like InnoCentive do for problem solvers. InnoCentive got its start as e.Lilly, an innovation unit inside the drug company Eli Lilly. Now it's a marketplace where hundreds of companies post problems and a reward amount, and 250,000 solvers around the world get to work. Can you invent a no-contact way to weigh pigs from a distance? You can win $50,000. Have a method for reducing fat absorption in battered fried foods? Can you find a more ecologically sustainable material that mimics wood? There are prizes for that, too.
While awards for past achievement can spur innovation - a significant amount of American investigative journalism might not take place without prizes like the Pulitzer - forward-looking prizes for specific challenges are far more efficient. They are extraordinarily cost-effective. Look at Harrison and his clock: the 20,000 he won was enormous for him, but it was a tiny sum compared to what the British government might have spent to solve the longitude problem by giving grants to various astronomers or cartographers. The fact that prizes pay only for success also makes them attractive to those who finance them, whether they are taxpayers, shareholders or charitable donors.
More important, prizes work where other methods do not. A lot of problems aren't new - someone has already solved them or has solved something similar. By casting a very wide net, prizes find these people.
Winners tend not to be the people you expect. The principal scientific adviser to the Board of Longitude - someone to be reckoned with, as it was Isaac Newton - had said that the only solutions possible for the longitude problem would come from astronomy. No one thought the answer would be found in a new kind of clock. If the British had spent money on grants to the usual suspects, it would have been wasted. The conventional wisdom is that if you want to solve a molecular biology problem you ask only molecular biologists. Big mistake.
At Harvard Business School, Lakhani led a study of hundreds of scientific problems posted on InnoCentive. These were problems that the laboratories of science-driven companies had mostly failed to solve, which is why they turned to InnoCentive. They found that InnoCentive's network solved nearly 30 percent of them.
What made for success? InnoCentive asks solvers to check boxes indicating the different scientific fields that interest them. The more diverse the interests of the base of solvers, the more likely the problem was to be solved. The study also found that expertise in the field of the problem actually a solver's chances. "The further the problem from the solver's expertise, the more likely they are to solve it," Lakhini and his co-authors concluded. If the problem fell outside a solver's expertise, that raised his or her chance of success by 10 percent. In addition to being a technical outsider, being a social outsider also helped - women did significantly better than men, perhaps because they tended to be more marginalized in the scientific community. Alph Bingham, one of InnoCentive's founders, told McKinsey that "you wouldn't hire" a significant percentage of successful solvers based on their credentials.
This seems bizarre, but it is consistent with scientific history, which shows that innovation occurs when knowledge from one scientific discipline is applied to another. "Innovation happens when someone comes in from a different perspective and breaks a problem open," says Lakhani. "But rarely do we have mechanisms in place so this happens systematically." Prizes provide that mechanism.
Prizes have other advantages. They can correct some of the market failures in our current strategy for encouraging innovation, the patent system. Patents reward innovators with a period of monopoly control over their invention. This means that there is very little incentive to pursue innovations that don't promise to be lucrative. To see the distortions this can cause, look at medicine. Some very serious diseases attract very little research, because the market they offer doesn't make expensive research and development worthwhile. Rare disorders - defined as those that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States - get very little research, and there are more than 7,000 of them. Other diseases may be widespread, but mainly among people who can't pay. Nor do companies have an incentive to pursue one-off treatments, as therapies that must be taken every day are far more lucrative.
The reward for innovation - a 20-year monopoly - can also create perverse incentives. Last year, the Office of Health Economics, a think tank with connections to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, wrote a report funded by GlaxoSmithKline recommending that Britain, together with the United States, offer prizes instead of patents to spur the invention of new antibiotics. The problem is that patent holders try to sell as much as possible before their monopoly expires and generic competition sets in. The report warned that the patent system was encouraging potentially dangerous overuse of antibiotics, creating drug resistance.
Another market failure in the patent system is that monopoly control can limit access to a new product. Especially when an innovation is in the public interest, it's counterproductive to encourage the patent holder to price it out of range of most users.
Prizes can help, as they reward innovation without monopoly control. The World Health Organization is currently studying the use of prizes to stimulate medical discovery. In the United States, the idea's champion is the quixotic Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont. One of Sanders' proposal would create a Medical Innovation Prize Fund, which would offer more than $80 billion a year in prizes to drugs that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration- a far bigger pot for drug makers than in previous discussions of the idea. The prize would replace the monopoly control that currently rewards pharmaceutical companies - generic competition would begin immediately. Sanders claims the fund would create $250 billion in savings annually by bringing down drug prices.
This sweeping bill has zero prospects of passing into law, but a smaller bill, which would use this system just for new AIDS drugs, might do better. Since AIDS patients now live longer lives, the number of people on AIDS therapy in the United States is piling up, and the government bears most of the cost. With therapy reaching $35,000 a year in some cases, the burden is growing unsustainable.
"The fact that the U.S. government is running out of money makes things like this less science fiction," said Jamie Love, the director of Knowledge Ecology International. "It's one of the few things out there that saves money and expands access at the same time."
When I was starting work on this column, numerous people wrote to alert me to creative new prizes. I welcome hearing more about them in comments.

HEADLINE: What Mitt Lost While He Won

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Romney held on to win two more states, but at what cost to his prospects against President Obama? 

 BODY:
In the end, Mitt Romney didn't lose the Michigan primary, and he didn't lose his near-lock on the Republican nomination. Rick Santorum isn't going away, but a solid victory in Michigan and an easy win in Arizona leaves the Romney campaign's basic math more or less intact. If their candidate can keep winning contests in the West and Northeast and holding serve across the Midwest, Romney's rivals won't be able to stop him from grinding out a victory. 
But the frontrunner did lose something in the days leading up to the Michigan vote. He lost his general election narrative.
From the very first debates onward, Romney has spent the primary campaign walking a fine line - trying to assuage widespread right-wing doubts about his ideological reliability, while crafting a persona and a policy portfolio that will appeal to moderates as well as conservatives come November. 
Two months ago, as the primary voting began, this balancing act appeared to be succeeding. Romney had sketched out an economic plan that avoided the supply-side gimmicks and outright crankery embraced by many of his rivals. He had backed the smartest conservative thinking on entitlements and was rewarded with bipartisan cover when Oregon Democratic Senator Ron Wyden endorsed a similar model for Medicare reform. 
Thanks to his own smooth evasiveness and the blunders of his rivals, meanwhile, he had managed to sidestep the obvious resemblances between his Massachussetts health care bill and the White House's Affordable Care Act. And by selling himself as a turnaround artist rather than an ideologue, a champion of the middle class rather than a defender of his fellow 1 percenters, he seemed well-positioned to campaign on competence, experience and sound economic stewardship in the general election.
But then came the South Carolina primary, and Romney's fumbling, tone-deaf responses to Newt Gingrich's attacks on his career at Bain Capital. His awkwardness didn't have direct policy implications, but it revealed a surprising inability to defend his own chosen electoral narrative against fairly obvious attacks. And with the businessman-turnaround artist narrative compromised, it became much easier for Romney's rivals to turn the focus to his moderate past and long list of flip-flops.
It was to change this dynamic, presumably, that Romney's campaign decided to have him come out for the first time with a big tax reform plan of his own, which he unveiled last week in a speech at Ford Field. In its broadest strokes, the plan isn't terrible: It promises lower rates and a broader base, which is the goal of just about every sensible tax reform proposal, and it cuts rates for most taxpayers, not just businesses and the rich. But the Romney campaign has declined to explain exactly how the cuts will be paid for, offering vague promises of loophole closing and spending cuts that suggest a return to supply-side irresponsibility.
If left unrevised and unaddressed, this irresponsibility threatens to demolish the pillars of Romney's general-election argument. First, it will make it considerably harder for him to attack the White House's record on deficits, which would otherwise be a central part of the case against the president. Second, it will make Romney's own vision for entitlement reform easy to demagogue and dismiss, since President Obama will have grounds to argue that his opponent only wants to cut Medicare and Social Security in order to cut taxes on the rich. 
Both of these problems, needless to say, will be exacerbated if Romney continues to be unable to talk about his wealth in anything save the most clueless and flatfooted fashion. The White House might prefer to face Rick Santorum in the general election, but an out-of-touch rich guy running on Medicare cuts and an ill-considered tax plan will make for a pretty inviting target in his own right.
This is not where Romney expected to find himself at this point in the campaign, with months and months of careful positioning undone by several weeks of gaffes and defensive political maneuverings. But between his verbal miscues and his clumsy attempts to defend his right flank on policy, the likely Republican nominee is suddenly headed for the kind of political and ideological cul-de-sac that losing presidential candidates often end up occupying. 
Thanks to the voters of Michigan, Romney's path to the nomination is as wide open as ever. But his path to the White House has narrowed considerably.

HEADLINE: Prime Minister Singh's Latest Interview

BYLINE: HEATHER TIMMONS


HIGHLIGHT: On nuclear energy, NGOs and the future of science in India. 

 BODY:
If you want to know the latest candid thoughts of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, where should you look? Here's a multiple choice question:
A. Go to the PM's website, where his recent interviews with the media and speeches are carefully archived.
B. Keep your eye on local or international media - the prime minister gives frequent interviews and holds regular press conferences, where he welcomes questions about issues of the day, from inflation to Iran. 
C. Follow the PM on his twitter feed, @PMOIndia, where he is answering questions from citizens and journalists alike.
D. Shell out $15 (about 730 Indian rupees) to Science, a 132 year-old magazine published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which interviewed the prime minister this month on nuclear power, the space program and inclusive development in India.
If you answered "D" you would be correct. A few highlights from the article and interview are below:
The prime minister enjoys a sort of "street cred" among academics, authors Pallava Bagla and Richard Stone write, and his "soft-spoken demeanor" belies his "grit" on issues important to scientists.
The prime minister on research and development spending and education:
"We need to spend a lot more on research and development."
While public spending on R&D is roughly the same as other developing countries "it is the private sector in our country which has to do a lot more."
"Our real problem is quality teaching staff. We are trying to induce more people to go for Ph.D. degrees in science and technology."
The country "must find innovative means to draw upon the Indians working in the universities abroad, particularly in the United States, to find some time to spend teaching in our country."
On foreign NGOs and nuclear energy:
"There are NGOs, often funded from the United States and the Scandinavian countries, which are not fully appreciative of the developmental challenges that our country faces."
"The atomic energy program has got into difficulties because these NGOs, mostly I think based in the United States, don't appreciate the need for our country to increase the energy supply."
"The thinking segment of our population certainly is supportive of nuclear energy."
On the future of science in India:
"I think people will see space technology also as a new way of dealing with the ancient scourges of poverty, ignorance and disease."
"One has to be optimistic. In poor countries, unless one is optimistic, one is overwhelmed by the dimension of the development task that we have to accomplish."
To read the interview in its entirety, you can subscribe to Science or buy the article alone here.

HEADLINE: Bonuses Dip on Wall St., but Far Less Than Earnings

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: While annual payouts to finance industry employees in New York are forecast to drop 14 percent during the bonus season, profits plunged in 2011, falling 51 percent, according to the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli. 

 BODY:
9:07 p.m. | Updated 
It is apparently going to take more than shrinking bank profits to put a big dent in Wall Street bonuses.
The total payout to security industry workers in New York is forecast to drop only 14 percent during this bonus season, according to a report issued on Wednesday by the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli. By comparison, profits last year plunged 51 percent.
"The securities industry, which is a critical component of the economies of New York City and New York State, faces continued challenges as it works through the fallout from the financial crisis and adjusts to regulatory reforms," Mr. DiNapoli said in a statement.
Hurt by the European debt crisis, a sluggish economic environment at home and the introduction of new regulations that have threatened once-profitable business lines, the nation's largest banks had a weak 2011. Goldman Sachs reported that profit dropped 67 percent from 2010. Morgan Stanley's earnings fell more than 40 percent.
In all, securities firms in New York made an estimated $13.5 billion in 2011, down sharply from $27.6 billion in 2010, according to the comptroller's estimates. It is the second consecutive year that Wall Street's profit fell by more than half.
"The financial industry is in the midst of structural change," said Ronnie Lowenstein, the director of the New York City Independent Budget Office. "It's not just the boom and bust cycle we've seen in the past."
Despite the difficult environment, New York firms paid roughly $20 billion in year-end cash compensation to their employees. The average bonus was $121,150, down just 13 percent from the year before as the head count shrank. In 2006, the year before the financial crisis, the average investment bank employee took home a bonus of $191,360.
But the comptroller's estimates do not include noncash compensation given for last year and so may not give the full picture given that many banks dole out a larger portion of their annual payouts in stock.
Still, a dip in year-end cash compensation is cause for concern for New York government officials. Before the financial crisis, Wall Street accounted for 20 percent of the state's tax revenue. Last year, that tally was 14 percent. For New York City, the share dropped to 7 percent of tax revenue from 13 percent over the same period.
"The city budget is dependent on a very small group of people - the 1 percent, if you will," said Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. "If the 1 percent isn't doing well, the city's not doing well."
Not only is it local and state governments that are feeling the pinch of lower Wall Street pay. High-end restaurants, luxury goods stores and the real estate market in New York stand to suffer as well. Mr. DiNapoli estimates that every job lost in the securities industry in New York costs two city jobs in other industries.
For the Wall Street firms themselves, compensation has presented a quandary. It is their biggest cost and banks have been cutting thousands of jobs amid the worst year for banks since the financial crisis. Yet at the same time, keeping pay relatively stable is critical to retaining and rewarding employees.
Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said at an investor conference on Tuesday that even in tough times, he would not pay his employees less than the going rate.
"We are going to pay competitively," Mr. Dimon told a roomful of analysts and investors at the conference. "We need top talent. You cannot run these businesses with second-rate talent."
Wall Street continues to be a lightning rod for politicians and critics who contend that the industry's pay packages are too high. In 2010, the average pay, including bonuses, in the securities industry in New York City hit $361,180. (Figures are not yet available for 2011.) At that level, Wall Street paychecks are 5.5 times higher than those in the rest of the private sector.
Banks are wrestling with ways to trim the tab, including paying more stock and less cash. At Morgan Stanley, for instance, cash bonuses were capped at $125,000 - a small fortune to many Americans, but a pittance for investment bankers and traders used to seven-figure payouts.
Some top executives at the bank, including James P. Gorman, the chief executive, deferred the entire cash portion of their bonuses.
"It's a pickle," said Alan Johnson, a compensation consultant who advises big banks on their pay plans. "Paying employees and giving attention to the external constituents, be they politicians or regulators, is a very delicate balance."
As Wall Street struggles to adapt to leaner times, government officials are asking themselves what it means if the industry never returns to its heights before the crisis.
"Local and state politicians see this as a cycle we've seen a million times," Ms. Gelinas of the Manhattan Institute said.
"They're kind of conditioned to kick the can down the road, because down the road, Wall Street comes and rescues them. The problem is, they're not looking at the structural change," she said.
In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. DiNapoli said that while he believed that "the ups and downs and the cycles are always there" on Wall Street, he and other state officials had been forced to prepare for the possibility that securities firms might never be able to hoist up the local and regional tax base.
"This could be the new normal," he said.

HEADLINE: The Breakfast Meeting: James Murdoch Leaves News International and No Closure Yet for G.O.P.

BYLINE: NOAM COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Also, getting an injured journalist out of Syria and a rave for Sony's new mobile game device, the Vita. 

 BODY:
On the heels of accusations that employees at the News Corporation's Sun newspaper were paying off government officials and police sources, the embattled James Murdoch stepped down as head of the company's News International division, according to a news release put out Wednesday morning. Mr. Murdoch, who was scheduled to return to New York to take a larger role within the company before the hacking scandal broke, will continue in his role as News Corp.'s deputy chief operating officer.
"We are all grateful for James' leadership at News International and across Europe and Asia, where he has made lasting contributions to the group's strategy in paid digital content and its efforts to improve and enhance governance programs," said his father, Rupert, who is the company's chairman. No mention of News International's current troubles were mentioned.
Mitt Romney handily won the Arizona primary Tuesday night, and narrowly triumphed in his native state of Michigan, Jeff Zeleny reported, results that "reasserted his control over the Republican presidential race as it advances to critical Super Tuesday contests next week." Yet, Jim Rutenberg writes, the victory in Michigan was slim enough - by a three-percentage-point margin over his less-well-financed opponent Rick Santorum - that it "exposed once again Mr. Romney's weakness among social conservatives."

        
While the Republican presidential primary may well have seen its last debate, Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and current Fox News host, can still get the candidates to share the stage, Jeremy Peters reports. His third presidential forum, from Ohio on Saturday, has commitments from three of the four candidates - only Ron Paul has yet to say yes.

        
An Economist correspondent was briefly arrested Tuesday night at Diamond Center in Novi, Mich., The Observer reported. She and other reporters covering Mitt Romney's victory speech were put in a press filing room; when they discovered there was a delay between what he said and what they heard, she went to hear it live and was soon facing a police officer, who cuffed her.
The successful effort to smuggle a wounded British photojournalist out of Syria came at a high cost, The Washington Post reported, with 13 opposition activists dying after an ambush by government forces. The photojournalist, Paul Conroy, made it to Lebanon, but three other journalists with him - including the injured Edith Bouvier, who President Nicolas Sarkozy of France at first said had made it out - had to scatter.
On the City Room blog, David Dunlap discusses the unfortunate placement of advertising billboards for the AMC series "Mad Men," which returns next month for a new season. The image of a falling man - which resonates in New York because of 9/11 - is particularly jarring when you look up and see it, as you do on Seventh Avenue and 30th Street.
Sony took on an unusual challenge, Seth Schiesel writes: make a new mobile game-playing device when more and more of the public already routinely carries one, in the form of a smartphone. But creating the device, PlayStation Vita, twice as big as a phone, was a worthy investment, he writes: "The Vita is the finest mobile gaming system yet made for adults. It's that simple."

HEADLINE: Bloomberg and Upstate Leaders Slam Pension Costs

BYLINE: DANNY HAKIM


HIGHLIGHT: The mayor and the heads of other municipalities around the state traveled to Albany to show support for major changes to public pensions. 

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and municipal leaders from across the state traveled to the Capitol on Wednesday to back Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's call for pension reform. 
The mayors and county leaders said local governments were being hurt by soaring pension costs, which have led to layoffs and service cuts. 
"Mounting pension costs are crushing the budgets of every public employer in New York State," Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference, adding, "We're spending more money on pensions than on police, fire and sanitation together."
Maggie Brooks, the Monroe County executive, said "the threat of bankruptcy hangs over every single municipal government in the state because of escalating pension costs." 
New York City, for example, is required to put $8 billion this year into its pension system, up from $1.5 billion in 2002. Both the city and state pension systems, like other public pension systems across the country, are straining to make up for steep investment losses incurred in the 2008 financial crisis. 
Mr. Cuomo has proposed, as part of the state's next budget, to reduce pension benefits for future hires and to create a 401(k)-like retirement option for workers. The plan is strongly supported by Mr. Bloomberg and business groups, but is opposed by labor unions and one of their strongest allies in Albany, Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli. 
Mr. Cuomo's proposal would do little to alleviate short-term financial problems for local governments, but over the next three decades, it would save $80 billion for New York City and other municipalities, Mr. Bloomberg said.
The municipal leaders visited Albany one day after The New York Times reported that the state pension fund was lending hundreds of millions of dollars to the state and local governments across New York to help them pay their pension bills. On Long Island, Nassau and Suffolk Counties together are borrowing about $85 million this year to make their pension contributions. 
Steve Bellone, the Suffolk County executive, said, "it's the worst thing that you can do, financially, but when you are up against the wall, as the mayor said, and you have a county that's used every one-shot revenue that it could possibly use already, and you're facing a deficit of huge proportions, suddenly that becomes not such a bad option, but that's where we're at today. We are in a financial crisis."
Thomas M. Roach, the mayor of White Plains, also took a dim view of the practice by which municipalities amortize their pension costs, or pay them back over a decade with interest. 
"The road to hell is paved in amortizing pensions," he said. 
Municipal leaders have long lamented the State Legislature's habit of perennially sweetening pension benefits. Taking a shot at Mr. DiNapoli, Mr. Bloomberg said: "I think some of the things he said, that the real impact here is from the performance of the investments and not from the increase in benefits mandated by the state, is just factually incorrect, period."
Eric Sumberg, a spokesman for the comptroller, disagreed, saying in a statement, "The higher contribution rates for employers have been driven primarily by the financial meltdown of 2008-9. It is also important to remember that pension costs are based on payroll levels, which have increased in many municipalities and which rise further when employers voluntarily enroll their employees in more expensive retirement plans."

HEADLINE: In Ohio, Romney Pivots His Attention to Obama

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney also attacks China for currency manipulation and unfair business practices. 

 BODY:
TOLEDO, Ohio - When word finally came down that Mitt Romney had won the Arizona and Michigan primaries on Tuesday night, Mr. Romney thanked the crowd and his supporters, acknowledged that it had been a disconcertingly close race, and pivoted quickly to attacking President Obama. On Wednesday morning, the same strategy was on display in Ohio.
Speaking to a modest-sized group of less than 100 people at fence post manufacturing company here, Mr. Romney briefly acknowledged his primary victories before laying into Mr. Obama.
"It was a big night last night for me," Mr. Romney said. "I was very pleased, very good news - Arizona, and Michigan, right next door. And interestingly the people who said that the economy and jobs were their No. 1 issue, they voted for me overwhelmingly."
He referred to his rivals fleetingly, and not by name, saying only that while he had private-sector experience, the other men were all "Washington insiders" who would not have as good a chance of beating Mr. Obama in November.
In addition to the president, Mr. Romney reserved some of his harshest criticism for China, a country he has previously taken a hardline stance against, but has not brought up recently.
"How is it China's been so successful in taking away our jobs? Well, let me tell you how - by cheating," said Mr. Romney, who called China a "currency manipulator. "When you hold down your currency artificially, it makes your products artificially less expensive, and by virtue of doing that and holding down their prices, they are able to put American businesses out of business, and kill American jobs."
He said that China had pushed many American fence post manufacturers out of business, but congratulated American Posts, where he was speaking, for being able to hold onto its share of the market.
"They also steal our designs and our patents and our brand names and our know-how," Mr. Romney continued. "And on that basis they're able to take jobs. And they hack into our computers - corporate computers and government computers - and steal as well."
Watching Mr. Romney's pitch from the back of the room was Samuel Wurzelbacher, who is running for Congress in Ohio's Ninth District, and is perhaps better known as "Joe the Plumber." Though he has not endorsed any Republican for president and has no plans to do so, he said he makes a point of seeing as many candidates as possible when they pass through town, and had also seen Rick Santorum speak recently.
"They like to pretend they're blue collar when they up there," Mr. Wurzelbacher said, gesturing to the stage Mr. Romney had just vacated. "But that's not specific to Mitt, that's specific to all politicians."
When asked about Mr. Romney's trouble connecting with voters, including some recent comments that seemed to underscore his wealthy background, Mr. Wurzelbacher said, "I mean, it's who you hang out with."
"I go hunting and fishing and like outdoorsmen, so that's the kind of people I know and can connect with," he said. "To me, hanging out in a roomful of bankers wouldn't work for me."

HEADLINE: Romney on a Nuclear Iran, and Love

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney opens up for the second day in a row. 

 BODY:
BEXLEY, Ohio - After the New Hampshire primary, where question-and-answer sessions with voters and retail politics are an inextricable part of winning the state, Mitt Romney's campaign began slowly cutting back on the number of town halls he held.
But he held one Wednesday afternoon in Ohio, holding forth on a variety of topics, from foreign policy to health care. The event revealed a more personal side of the candidate when a young girl asked how he would most like to be remembered.
"Well, around my home, I like to be known as having been a very good father," Mr. Romney said. "If I am lucky enough to become president of the United States, there is a legacy I also would like to leave, and that would be that I helped the American people with good jobs and with a bright and prosperous future. I want people to know that I have passion for America and that I made America stronger and made our future brighter."
A few other topics Mr. Romney covered during his 31-minute question-and-answer session with Ohio voters, as well his own introductory remarks:
On his top foreign policy priority:
"Yeah, No. 1 objective is keeping Iran from having a nuclear weapon. The greatest threat to America is nuclear material in the hands of fanatics from Iran, whether the ayatollahs or Ahmadinejad."
Mr. Romney added: "This president has failed to secure crippling sanctions against Iran. I believe he could have done so. When he decided he was going to give Russia their No. 1 foreign policy objective, which was a decision to remove our missile defense sites from Eastern Europe, he could have gotten something in return - such as their willingness not to veto crippling sanctions against Iran. He didn't, inexplicable. When voices of democracy, or voices of dissent, took to the streets in Iran, and were calling out for support around the world, our president had nothing to say. Even Bill Clinton would have said something!"
On Rick Santorum, and his other Republican rivals:
"We've got some other folks in this race, in the primary - good folks they are - but they haven't spent their life in the private sector. They don't understand business and job creation and entrepreneurs and innovation, like someone who spent 25 years doing that. Rick Santorum's a nice guy, but he's an economic lightweight that doesn't understand what it takes to make an economy work on a personal basis."
Mr. Romney added: "If I'm the nominee, I'm going to beat Barack Obama. I don't think anyone else can. I'm going to get the job done." 
Asked to offer an example of his heart:
"I think like the rest of you in this room, by far the most important thing in my life is my wife, all right? Ann and I fell in love young; we're still in love. We have a marriage that is still filled with love. And her happiness is my happiness. I care more about that than anything in the world."
