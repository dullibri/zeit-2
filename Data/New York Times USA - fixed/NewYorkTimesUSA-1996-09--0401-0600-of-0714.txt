HEADLINE: Ford Reaches Tentative Pact With Union

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Sept. 16

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers union reached agreement this evening on a new national labor contract intended to protect the jobs of current and future union workers, while providing wage increases modestly exceeding the inflation rate.
While union and corporate executives refused to discuss the pact's details, Wall Street analysts said the contract would last three years and represented a landmark compromise for Ford's 105,000 U.A.W.-represented workers. Ford guaranteed that the number of U.A.W. workers in its factories would remain at least at 95 percent of the current total, with Ford hiring new workers if necessary to replace retirees, they said. 
 In exchange, analysts said, Ford won the right to pay permanently lower wages in any new auto parts businesses that it might enter, either by building new factories or by buying them.
Both sides said the deal was mutually beneficial. "We're satisfied; I think we've got a good deal," said Alexander Trotman, Ford's chairman, chief executive and president, at a news conference.
Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W.'s president, said that he hoped to persuade General Motors and Chrysler to accept similar contracts. "We were going after an agreement all the companies could work with, and that's where we are," he said.
Wall Street analysts differed on whether G.M., with its large work force, could afford to guarantee to keep employment at 95 percent of current levels. "If I had to make up something G.M. couldn't accept, that would be it," said David B. Healy, an auto analyst at Burnham Securities.
But Nicholas Lobaccaro, an analyst at Bear, Stearns, thought that G.M. might have little choice about accepting the same terms, given the damage that a U.A.W. strike this autumn could wreak on G.M.'s planned introduction of 15 new models. "If it comes down to a game of chicken, I would have to bet on the union," Mr. Lobaccaro said.
The U.A.W. chose to negotiate first with Ford after the company drafted the innovative deal that was apparently approved today. People close to the Detroit auto makers were already able to describe this compromise in interviews on Sept. 4 and 5, although hard bargaining was needed in the final days to fix the precise level of employment that Ford would guarantee.
The U.A.W. has warm relations with Ford, and never even threatened a strike during the negotiations. By contrast, the union and G.M. have an adversarial relationship that produced a 17-day strike in March at two brake factories in Dayton, Ohio, that crippled the North American operations of the company, the world's largest industrial enterprise.
The wage and benefit details of today's Ford pact were decided at the last moment, after the expiration of the previous three-year agreement at midnight on Saturday. Wall Street analysts said Ford had agreed to a sharp increase in pension benefits, a $2,000 bonus for all workers and a 3 percent raise in each of the second and third years of the contract. The bonus and raise are in addition to the U.A.W.'s annual cost-of-living adjustments, which the union has had since 1948.
Stephen Girsky, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said the settlement was fairly costly. He predicted the higher pension benefits would hurt G.M., which has considerably more pensioners than Ford in proportion to its current workers.
"It looks to me like Ford gave where they could afford to give and where other guys potentially couldn't," Mr. Girsky said.
G.M.'s workers have an average age of 48, and are retiring at a rate of roughly 5 percent a year. The 95 percent employment guarantee, if applied to G.M., would prevent the company. from taking advantage of that reduction in its work force.
The previous three-year labor contract for Ford's 105,000 U.A.W. employees expired at midnight on Saturday, but work continued without any disruption while the negotiators wrapped up their deal.
The union scheduled a board meeting for Tuesday, a meeting of local union presidents on Wednesday and a ratification vote by union members on Sept. 29.
All of the union approvals are nearly automatic because the U.A.W. is a highly centralized bureaucracy and its members, particularly at Ford, traditionally ratify new contracts by margins of 9 to 1 or more.
Mr. Yokich said this evening that the U.A.W. had not made a decision on whether to negotiate next with Chrysler or G.M. He pointed out that he was in close touch with the Canadian Automobile Workers, which is negotiating with Chrysler and is threatening to go on strike at midnight on Tuesday if a deal cannot be reached by then.
The U.A.W. and the Canadian union have a tradition of not negotiating with the same company at the same time.
If the Canadian union does go on strike, it would halve Chrysler's production of highly profitable minivans. Basil E. Hargrove, the Canadian union's president, broke off negotiations with Chrysler early this evening, but resumed them shortly before midnight following more discussions on restrictions on Chrysler's purchase of parts from outside suppliers.
Nicole A. Solomon, a Chrysler spokeswoman, was optimistic that a strike still could be averted. "We believe that we will have an agreement with the C.A.W., hopefully tomorrow," Ms. Solomon said.
Mr. Hargrove was more worried. "The clock is working against us at this point," he said late tonight.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE CANDIDATES;
Dole Attacks on Crime, but Clinton Is Ready

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
The 1996 Presidential campaign abruptly shifted from the economy to crime today. Bob Dole maintained that President Clinton had presided over an epidemic of juvenile drug use and crime, and Mr. Clinton appeared amid an ocean of blue uniforms to receive the support of the nation's largest police union.
Mr. Dole's tough-worded attack, at Villanova University, was buttressed by a new round of television advertisements devoted to crime and drugs, and signaled that he would play down, at least for the next few days, the tax-cut proposal that has dominated his campaign for more than a month but has yet to show signs of catching on. 
 Instead, he will turn increasingly to the crime issue, which has served Republicans reliably since Richard M. Nixon's election to the Presidency in 1968.
But the endorsement of Mr. Clinton, by the Fraternal Order of Police, a 270,000-member union that had never before supported a Democrat for President, was yet another marker of success in his longstanding effort, dating from his years as Governor of Arkansas, to seize the issue from Republicans.
For the event announcing that endorsement, the President traveled to Cincinnati, where George Bush won the same union's backing four years ago in the race against Mr. Clinton.
The timing of today's event allowed it to compete against Mr. Dole's anti-crime speech at Villanova, a major appearance on the Republican nominee's schedule.
Mr. Dole issued his critique of Mr. Clinton's record on drugs and crime to a cheering, mostly college-age audience in a gymnasium at the university, along Philadelphia's Main Line.
He won a standing ovation as he promised that he would cut drug use among teen-agers in half during his first term in office. His audience cheered again when he promised that as President he would issue an executive order requiring able-bodied Federal convicts to work at least 40 hours a week while in prison, with their pay compensating the victims of their crimes. He also called for cutting back prisoner access to pornography and weight-lifting rooms; urged legislation to treat violent juvenile criminals as adults in sentencing, consideration of prior crimes and public release of their criminal records, and said he would double, to $810 million, the annual Federal contribution to state prison-building programs to make it easier to abolish parole for violent felons.
Mr. Dole has already pledged to cut taxes by $548 billion over six years while concurrently balancing the Federal budget, and his aides were unable to explain today where the increased financing of prison construction would come from.
In any event, his speech was less notable for new proposals than for the implicit acknowledgment that the tax-cut idea that has been a staple of his campaign may not be working, and for his moving aggressively to an alternative theme. Mr. Dole repeatedly suggested that what he described as Mr. Clinton's liberal ways had contributed to a values breakdown that explained a surge in drug use.
"Liberalism keeps showing itself through the Administration's crime policies," he said, speaking forcefully as he stood on a stage filled with the Republican governors of 13 states as well as his running mate, Jack Kemp. "Yes, the President talks about being tough on crime. But, as with so much else that this Administration does, his actions tell a different story than his words. He talks like Dirty Harry, but he acts like Barney Fife."
(Clinton aides later noted that the line contrasting Clint Eastwood's tough San Francisco police officer with the bumbling deputy sheriff on the old "Andy Griffith Show" was originally used by Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia, in referring to President Bush, during a keynote speech at the 1992 Democratic National Convention.)
Mr. Dole blamed the "Administration's old liberal view that law enforcement is less important than social engineering" for drug use among teen-agers. His aides explained later that this was a reference to what they portrayed as Mr. Clinton's emphasis on drug treatment, at the expense of law enforcement.
"This liberal approach failed over and over and over again through the decades," Mr. Dole said, adding, "Americans are tired of being guinea pigs in a discredited liberal-leaning laboratory of leniency."
"What works in combating crime is no mystery," Mr. Dole said. "It begins with the understanding that the cause of crime can be explained with one simple word: Criminals. Criminals. Criminals."
Mr. Dole cited statistics showing a sharp increase in drug use. Most recently, in August, the Government reported that drug use among teen-agers soared 105 percent from 1992 to 1995. Mr. Dole laid the blame for that at the White House steps.
"Thanks to the liberal wink-and-nod policies of this Administration," he said, "drug use among teen-agers has not just started up again, it's skyrocketing upward."
Hours after Mr. Dole had completed his speech, Mr. Clinton offered what amounted to a visual rebuttal. He took the stage at the Cincinnati Music Hall -- rain had forced the event indoors -- surrounded by men and women in blue uniforms, in front of a big blue banner that said, "Law Enforcement Stands Behind President Clinton."
The endorsement announced there by the Fraternal Order of Police was a reward for Mr. Clinton's efforts to court law-enforcement organizations. From his longtime support for the death penalty, to passage of his 1994 crime bill intended to help localities hire 100,000 more police officers, to his successful backing of the Brady Bill and a ban on 19 types of assault weapons, the President has increasingly allied himself with law enforcers, against civil liberties groups and gun rights advocates alike.
Mr. Clinton has already received endorsements from the National Association of Police Organizations and the International Union of Police Associations. Those groups, together with the Fraternal Order, represent about 70 percent of all rank-and-file officers in the nation.
Rattling off a list of his anti-crime measures in Cincinnati today, Mr. Clinton said: "This Administration is not responsible for any of these ideas; we got all these ideas from law-enforcement people themselves. All we did was listen and act. All we did was take what was working and try to go national with it."
The President acknowledged the political difficulty encountered by some members of Congress in voting for two bills he supported that helped lead to today's endorsement: the assault-weapons ban and the Brady Bill, which requires a waiting period for handgun purchases.
"A lot of good people who voted for those bills were defeated in 1994 in their race for Congress," Mr. Clinton said, "because the interest group that was against them went out and told good, God-fearing people from Ohio and Arkansas and other places that the President had gone off the deep end and he and Congress had taken their guns away."
Mr. Clinton was joined on the flight from Washington to Cincinnati by the president of the Fraternal Order, Gilbert G. Gallegos, who told reporters that the endorsement was decided on a vote of 20 to 10 by the organization's board at a meeting in Houston last Friday.
While the Clinton endorsement by the police union, which supported Mr. Bush not only in 1992 but in 1988 as well, was clearly unwelcome news for Mr. Dole, he shrugged it off.
"We knew we wouldn't get the endorsement," he said in one of several interviews with local television stations around the country this afternoon. "He's been wining and dining the union officials. It is a union, so you can expect the union leaders -- not the rank and file, but the union leaders -- to go for the Democrats."

HEADLINE: Wall Streeters Test Water Futures

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE

 BODY:
The smartly dressed commuters walked down the gangplank for the East River Express yesterday, clutching newspapers and briefcases, flashing a smile as they boarded the ferry, a far cry from the city's crowded subways, where they jostle every day for a seat.
"I've been waiting for this for a long time," said Stephen P. Brooks, a Wall Street investment banker and a resident of the Upper East Side. "Finally, a pleasant way to commute." 
 And so it was throughout the first day of ferry service for hundreds of East Side commuters. At the 7:05 A.M. departure of the first ferry, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proclaimed that the service would spur the revitalization of the downtown financial district and make it more competitive with midtown.
The 35-minute morning ride on the ferryboat, the Henry Hudson, began at East 90th Street and continued to its final stop at Pier 17, at the South Street Seaport, making one other stop, at East 34th Street. At the 34th Street and Pier 17 stops, red, white and blue New York Waterway buses greeted passengers to take them near their offices without charge.
The ferry service will be free this week, and after that the operators will charge $5. But on Oct. 25, the ferry's operators, New York Waterway, will stop the service and reassess it. It plans to resume full operation by the spring.
During the early-morning ferry ride, which departed from an obscured dock near Carl Schurz Park on East 90th Street, passengers watched with self-satisfaction as thousands of cars remained stuck in traffic on Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and the Brooklyn Bridge.
While many Wall Streeters were aboard yesterday, there were also many riders who came to take advantage of the free service, giving the clientele the look of a cruise ship. Tourists, retirees and teen-agers out for a joy ride mixed in with the commuters who operators hope will be the mainstay of the service.
"It's very convenient," said Blair Boardman, an investment banker who lives on East 93d Street and works downtown. "It's nice to wake up on the water as opposed to being slammed against 300 people on the subway."
The ferry service was developed as an alternative for the thousands of Upper East Side commuters who have to fight through crowded subway cars, sit in traffic jams or pay up to $15 for a taxi to work.
But the ferry ride, when it does begin costing money, may not be for those on a tight budget. At $5 a pop, it is considerably more expensive than the $1.50 that the Transit Authority charges for the subways, the $3.50 to take a van or the $4 for an express bus. And Arthur E. Imperatore Jr., the New York Waterway president, said the price would remain at $5.
"If we made the price too low, we'd have too many people," Mr. Imperatore said. "And we'd have to add service, which adds to the cost."
Some passengers took the trip yesterday in part because it was free. They said that while they do not plan to use the ferry to go to work regularly, they plan to use it as a backup.
"It's a little expensive for me," said Martin Schwartzman, a software developer. But he added, "This is probably the nicest trip downtown I've ever had."
For many would-be passengers, however, the ferry arrives in the Wall Street area too late for many of the traders who must get to work bright and early. "I can't believe they did not check this out," said Brian Rieddle, one of the traders.
New York Waterway, which hauls about 25,000 commuters a day between New York and New Jersey across the Hudson, is selling ferry service as more reliable and pleasurable than driving or riding the train.
While the region's train tracks and highways were virtually shut down during the blizzard last January, the ferry sailed on, although with only a handful of passengers, Mr. Imperatore said.
Yesterday, there were a few bumps along the way. Six northbound pleasure boats rushed by, rocking the ferry, with the worst casualties being spilled coffee.

HEADLINE: Clerical Workers' Strike at Barnard Ends in Pact

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
After five months on the picket line, clerical workers at Barnard College yesterday ended one of the longest strikes ever at an American college by ratifying a contract in which Barnard gave in to employee demands on health insurance.
Ending a strike that embarrassed Barnard's administration and strained the strikers' finances, Barnard agreed to pay all of the workers' health insurance premiums and to allow the workers to remain in their old health care plan. 
 "It's a nice victory for labor," said Catherine Cook, one of the 164 strikers and an administrative assistant to Barnard's dean of studies. "It was a long strike, though."
During the emotional confrontation, many professors refused to hold classes on campus, while at commencement, dozens of students who supported the strike sought to pressure and embarrass Barnard's administration by unfurling banners and carrying signs.
While union members hailed the agreement, Barnard officials defended it, saying it achieved important health care savings for the college and contained almost all of Barnard's original pay offer. The strikers, members of Local 2110 of the United Auto Workers, will receive a 9.5 percent raise over three years, considerably more than many other New York unions have won recently, but a shade less than what clerical workers at neighboring Columbia Teachers' College won last year.
Barry Kaufman, Barnard's vice president for finance and administration, said, "While this was a difficult period for all of us, both the college and the union have achieved important economic objectives, and for us, it reverses a five-year trend of increases on health care costs."
Barnard officials said that by instituting such cost-cutting measures as requiring second opinions before medical procedures, the contract would save the school at least $120,000 in the first year. They also said Barnard saved money by rejecting the union's demand for pay increases retroactive to Jan. 1.
"The settlement is tremendously fair to both sides," said Robert Linn, who was brought in as Barnard's chief negotiator in early July after talks soured.
Under the contract, workers with more than five years' experience will receive a $150 lump-sum bonus in each of the next three years, workers with 10 years will receive $250, and those with 15 years, $400.
Among the stumbling blocks was Barnard's insistence that workers switch from a Group Health Inc. plan to Oxford, which the union rejected.

HEADLINE: Inventories Rise as Business Bets on Sales

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
Stockpiles of unsold goods at American businesses soared to the highest level in more than a decade in July, suggesting that businesses were betting that a surge in demand would continue.
Their gamble -- which lifted inventories by four-tenths of 1 percent, to more than $1 trillion, for the first time since 1982 -- could still pay off this fall, analysts said, even though the Government reported on Friday that retail sales in August barely budged from a month before. 
 Low joblessness, climbing wages, record consumer confidence and gains in the stock market are giving Americans renewed spending power, said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston in New York. "I don't see any reason to be pessimistic on the sales side," he said.
Still, economists had predicted an increase of only two-tenths of a percent in July business inventories. In June, inventories remained unchanged, according to a revised report from the Government. A month ago, the Commerce Department estimated that June inventories increased by a tenth of a percent.
Because total business sales in July grew by 1.2 percent, to $720.55 billion, the inventory-to-sales ratio -- a measure of how long it would take to sell existing stocks at the current pace -- fell to 1.39 months' worth in July from 1.40 months in June.
 Analysts attributed most of the rise in inventories to optimism about sales prospects. Still, "there seems to be a disconnect between what's happening at retail, manufacturing and wholesale levels," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at the Barnett Banks in Jacksonville, Fla. Indeed, Most of the July increase in inventories came at retailers, whose stockpiles rose 1.1 percent, while wholesale inventories rose only one-tenth of a percent and manufacturers' stocks rose by two-tenths of a percent.
A 1.4 percent rise in auto and truck inventories played a part in the retail buildup. And in the weeks since, Detroit auto makers have cautioned that sales gains will be hard to come by.
A lull in spending when inventory levels are high can force businesses to curtail production or orders while they empty warehouses and store shelves. "If retail sales fail to improve, we will start to see the repercussions throughout the pipeline," Ms. Reaser said.
While the inventory report caused some analysts to increase their third-quarter growth estimates to 2.8 percent or higher, they also said it lended more credence to the notion that the Federal Reserve would leave the Federal funds rate, its target rate for overnight lending between banks, unchanged at 5.25 percent at a policy meeting on Sept. 24.
The Fed "probably won't go until after the elections" in November, said Bill Gamba, a senior vice president at Cowen & Company. Still, investors, Fed policy makers and businesses face the same tough decision: gauging how fast the economy will grow in the months ahead, economists say. "Inventories can be a very big swing factor," Ms. Reaser said. "They can often make or break a quarter's reading on growth."

CORRECTION-DATE: September 20, 1996, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article by Bloomberg Business News on Tuesday about a Government report on business inventories in July referred incorrectly to the significance of a figure exceeding $1 trillion. That was the total reached in July for the first time since the Government began collecting inventory data in 1982. It was not the inventory figure for 1982.

The leader of the most powerful anti-Castro Cuban exile group in the United States announced yesterday that he had agreed to settle a libel suit against The New Republic for an article in the political weekly magazine that called him a mobster.
The magazine agreed to contribute $100,000 to the Cuban American National Foundation, or C.A.N.F., for a scholarship and to apologize for an article in the issue of Oct. 3, 1994, about the foundation's chairman, Jorge Mas Canosa. The article was headlined "Clinton's Miami Mobster." 
 The foundation and the magazine said in a joint statement, "The New Republic regrets its use of the word 'mobster' on the cover of the magazine and in a headline above the article (both of which were the sole responsibility of the New Republic and not the author) and apologizes for any injury or embarrassment that may have been caused to Mr. Mas Canosa or his family."
Mr. Mas Canosa said at a news conference in Miami, "I accept with much happiness this $100,000 on behalf of the C.A.N.F.," The Associated Press reported. "I believe this represents a victory for the cause of Cuban freedom and for our community."
It was the second legal victory of sorts for Mr. Mas Canosa; in August, Wayne Smith, a former American diplomat in Havana who is now a university professor and a specialist in Cuban affairs, was found to have defamed Mr. Mas Canosa's foundation in a 1992 PBS documentary.
A copy of the correction to be run in the next issue of The New Republic was attached to the joint statement. It read: "The New Republic did not intend to accuse Mr. Mas Canosa of being in any way connected to, or engaged in, criminal activity of any kind, nor was its use of the word based on any evidence of criminal activity on Mr. Mas Canosa'spart."
Floyd Abrams, a lawyer who is an expert on the First Amendment, said on the face of it, the settlement seemed appropriate. "I'm all in favor of magazines apologizing when they're wrong," Mr. Abrams said. "I think we have too little of that, not too much of it. There is nothing intrinsically troubling about it. If they called him that and they had no basis, then an apology is justified."
With the $100,000, the Cuban American foundation said it planned to establish "The New Republic Scholarship," for the education of needy Cuban-American students.
As part of the settlement, Mr. Mas Canosa agreed to dismiss his suit against the New Republic and the article's author, Ann Louise Bardach, a freelance writer. The libel suit was dismissed with prejudice, meaning that it can not be refiled.
"The New Republic and Mr. Mas Canosa are pleased to have resolved their dispute," the statement said, "because, although they may have differences, they both have strongly expressed support for policies aimed at bringing an end to the Communist dictatorship of Fidel Castro and bringing democracy to Cuba."
Mr. Mas Canosa's exile group lobbied successfully this year for passage of the Helms-Burton Act extending the American economic embargo against Cuba, and the organization is widely regarded as a principal architect of American policy toward Cuba.
 The article also misstated the occupation of Ann Louise Bardach, the author of the article. She is a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, not a freelance writer.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 10, 1996, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 17 about the settlement of a libel case filed by Jorge Mas Canosa, the leader of a Cuban exile group in the United States, against The New Republic misstated the issue in the lawsuit. It involved wording in the headline and an overline, not in the article itself.

HEADLINE: Misreading the Gender Gap

BYLINE: By Carol Tavris; Carol Tavris, a social psychologist, is the author of "The Mismeasure of Woman."

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Do you know about the gender gap in paranormal beliefs? Women are more likely than men to believe in horoscopes and psychics. People who are unsympathetic to women say it's because women are more gullible or dumber than men; those who are sympathetic to women say it's because women are more open-minded or spiritual than men.
Actually, this gender gap pretty much vanishes when you consider years of education and the number of math and science classes a person has taken. What appears to be a gender gap is in fact a science gap. 
 Do you know about the gender gap in anger? Men are more likely than women to express anger directly and abusively (except maybe in New York, where everyone ventilates). The antiwoman reason is that women are sneakier and more manipulative than men; the pro-woman version is that women are kinder and less aggressive than men.
Actually, the gender gap in expressions of anger pretty much vanishes when you consider the status of the people involved. Both sexes tend to be indirect and manipulative when they are angry at someone who has more power than they have -- say, bosses and police officers. And both sexes are equally likely to lose their tempers with people who have less power than they have -- say, store clerks or children. What appears to be a gender gap is really a power gap.
Now everybody is talking about the gender gap in the current Presidential campaign. Why are women, even suburban women, who lean more Republican, so much more likely than men to support President Clinton than Bob Dole? According to the most recent New York Times/ CBS News poll, women prefer Mr. Clinton over Mr. Dole by 61 percent to 33 percent. Men favor Mr. Clinton, but by a narrower margin: 49 percent to 42 percent.
First, it's interesting that the fluctuating political differences between the sexes, which ranged from trivial in the Nixon-Kennedy election in 1960 to significant today, capture the public imagination in ways that other "gaps" -- like wealth or geography -- do not. (The last time the country became as exercised about opinions divided along other than gender lines was in the days of the "generation gap" during the Vietnam War.)
Men and women, contrary to what those best-selling books say, aren't different species and don't come from different planets. The overlap between them, on voting choices or personality traits, is always greater than the differences that make headlines.
Then why do more women than men support President Clinton? Conservative explanations, such as one recently offered by Irving Kristol in The Wall Street Journal, are that women "tend to be more sentimental, more risk-averse and less competitive than men . . . and therefore are less inclined to be appreciative of free-market economics."
In short, they are by nature soft-headed liberals -- the kind, he adds, who devised and continue to support the American welfare state, which "has had a feminine coloration from the very beginning." (I guess the Depression didn't affect men, who must have stood idly by, cheering for free-market economics, while legions of women instituted the New Deal.)
Fortunately for conservatives, most women marry and have children, a condition that apparently neutralizes their inherent sentimentality and turns many of them into proper tough-minded Republicans.
Conservatives are so worried about all those women supporting the Democrats that they are claiming the Democratic Party itself has become "feminized" -- just about the nastiest charge you could level at an enemy.
The charge not only calls the enemy a wimp; it dismisses as trivial any issues the opposition endorses, such as the right to abortion, government programs for children and the poor, family leave or gun control, because these "feminine" concerns are of no relevance to the standard-issue human being, that is, the male variety.
Your true Masculinized Republican regards government support of just about any kind as crutches for the whiny. ("If terrible things happen to innocent people," Mr. Kristol explains, it's not up to government to help; the poor need only stoicism and prayer.)
The Democratic version of the gender gap is actually not much different from Mr. Kristol's, but with a positive spin. Women are voting Democratic, in this view, not because they are emotional and muddle-headed but because they are more compassionate and less aggressive than men, and thus attracted to the party that will help the weakest members of society.
Of course, the view that women are natural liberals -- whether that's good or bad -- doesn't explain why more than half of all women voted for Eisenhower, Nixon and Ronald Reagan. It doesn't explain why so many men support Mr. Clinton today, and it doesn't explain why gender gaps widen and shrink with the times.
So let's dispense with sentimental explanations based on personality or nature. Bellicosity is by no means a male preserve, nor is compassion a female one. Women, for all their vaunted empathy, have been as willing as men to regard their political and religious enemies as lesser human beings, heathen or vermin. Affluent women have never shown an especially tender-hearted sympathy toward their sisters in poverty.
Today's gender gap, like the race gap or wealth gap, is primarily caused by issues and economics. As Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, found, given a choice between a candidate they agree with on the issues but who has character flaws and a candidate with a good character with whom they disagree, both sexes choose the candidate they agree with, by a large margin.
And that, I think, is what is happening in this election too, except that women are more likely to agree with Bill Clinton than Bob Dole. Polls show that the gender gap emerged and widened as more women than men rejected the "Reagan Revolution" they once endorsed.
I'd like to think they changed their minds out of compassion, but a more likely motive is experience. A friend told me about a student of hers, an older woman who had returned to college. "I was always against welfare," the woman told my friend. "I thought it coddled the weak. Then my husband divorced me. I was left with nothing. Welfare saved my life until I could get myself together. I learned first-hand how many women are one divorce away from welfare." If a conservative is a liberal man who's been mugged, a liberal is a conservative woman who's been divorced.
The gender gap, then, is largely an experience gap. More women than men today worry that they or their children might need a safety net if they lose a job, lose a partner or lose their health. More women than men are taking care of aging, infirm parents. Many more single mothers than single fathers are raising children on their own. And young women are learning that sex discrimination in the workplace isn't quite the thing of the past they'd been led to believe.
For women to perceive that Democrats will be more responsive than Republicans to these concerns is neither sentimental nor irrational. It stems from self-interest -- surely a motive that conservatives understand. And the many men who share with women concerns about the health of their families, the education of their children and the stability of their jobs know that these issues are not "feminine," but human.

HEADLINE: Rap Star's Death Highlights Harsher Reality

 BODY:
To the Editor:
With the death of the rap performer Tupac Shakur (front page, Sept. 14), the result of a drive-by shooting on a Las Vegas street, observations are being made again about the sometimes violent lyrics in hip-hop music and the sometimes violent lives its practitioners lead.
A harsher reality is more clear: For too many African-American males of the under-35 generation, violence is the rule rather than the exception of their lives. They just don't care. Even more sobering: nobody else does. 
 As we in the hip-hop community brace for some sort of political attack in this election season, I caution the critics of gangsta rap to chill for a second. Though Mr. Shakur's writings include some troubling imagery, his most compelling works have to do with African-American family struggle. He wrote about the hardships of young women who bring into the world children they are not ready to raise, telling those women not to despair. "Dear Mama" -- an open letter to his mother, the 1960's black liberation activist Afeni Shakur, reveals Mr. Shakur's conflict/love regarding their relationship.
Like most rappers who grew up without fathers in the home, he was outspoken on this issue, telling MTV in 1994 that "I didn't have a father and that makes me cold and bitter." So many songs by young African-American male rappers refer to not having a father around, but nobody seems to be listening. Not Democrats. Not Republicans. Not the older African-American political leadership (but they'll all bark like a pit bull over the lyrics they don't like).
Though we may be numb to Tupac Shakur's murder, it cannot be divorced from the numbness we've developed trying to come up with solutions to the larger problems of African-American males in this society. Though the lack of community response should never justify antisocial behavior (black men also have a responsibility to evade the social land mines laid out for them), we've seen these men collectively become the irrelevant other.
Black or white, rich or poor, male or female, conservative or liberal: we are willfully blind to the 700,000 black men incarcerated in 1994 (up from 25,000 in 1960) and to the 11,000 killed as a result of homicide in 1993, both figures from the Bureau of Justice Statistics; to unemployment and life expectancy that lags far behind every other racial and gender classification.
This class of Americans doesn't have think tanks, political parties or lobbyists. To paraphrase the writer Ralph Wiley, that's why black boys tend to shoot.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Moves Slightly Higher On Hints of Higher U.S. Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar made small gains against most leading currencies yesterday after a report that 8 of the 12 Federal Reserve districts favor higher interest rates.
The dollar was also bolstered as France and Germany indicated they were committed to European monetary union, a development that weakened the mark and indirectly helped the dollar. With a unified currency, the mark would give up its role as the dominant European currency. 
 But the dollar's advance was muted as American stock and bond markets were weak for most of the day.
"The gains are still not terribly significant," said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, an advisory firm in Essex, Conn. "The move up is cushioned by the fact the market has had plenty of time" to factor in a possible rise in interest rates, he said. "People are cautious of buying the dollar near the highs."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.5136 marks, up from 1.5100 marks on Monday. The dollar traded at 110.24 yen, up from 110.10. The British pound slipped to $1.5560 from $1.5580.
Traders' attention was captured by a Reuters report that an unidentified senior Federal Reserve official had said that the presidents of 8 of the Fed's 12 district banks had requested a quarter-point increase in the largely symbolic discount rate and that a consensus was emerging for a similar increase in the more important Federal funds rate.
"That was enough for the bond market to take a turn and the dollar to push" upward, said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at the Bank Leumi Trust Company.
While the bond market does not like higher interest rates because they erode the value of fixed-income investments, traders in the dollar like them because higher rates attract foreign investors to dollar-denominated securities.
In Europe, the mark lost strength, indirectly helping the dollar, as Finance Minister Jean Arthuis of France reiterated that his country would meet its fiscal targets next year in the drive toward monetary union. France is to announce its budget today.
Also, Finance Minister Theo Waigel of Germany said France and Germany were moving toward an accord insuring adherence to the targets for monetary union.

HEADLINE: City Business Districts Are Held to Account

 BODY:
To the Editor:
To contend that New York City business improvement districts function "with virtually no oversight from an outside agency" (letter, Sept. 12) shows lack of knowledge.
Each district has a board of directors whose members must approve the district's annual expenditures. Sitting on each board is the local City Council member, the city comptroller and the commissioner of the Department of Business Services. On some boards the local community board has a representative. 
 Every May, each district must submit a report to the Department of Business Services that details the district's activities for the past year and includes a complete financial statement. The contract between a business improvement district and the city is usually for five years and is not automatically renewed.
All districts are required to hold annual meetings, open to all, where the next year's operating budget, staff salaries and other programs are presented for consideration and approval.

SERIES: Second of two columns on how to live safely with dogs.

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody 

 BODY:
MANY dog lovers act on impulse when they acquire canine companions. They may find an appealing stray on the street and take it in "temporarily." Or they may fall in love with an adorable puppy in the local pound or pet store. Either way, little thought is given to the nature of the beast and how well it will fit into the household and lives of its owners.
But experts on canine behavior and the characteristics of the more than 120 different breeds registered with the American Kennel Club say that while some who act on impulse are lucky and end up with a perfect pet, others pay a big price for failing to consider the kind of companion the dog they acquire is likely to be. 
 Is it a highly excitable or very active animal that would quickly wear out an older person? Is it wont to attack any stranger coming to the house? Does it snap at children? Does it attack other dogs? Does it frazzle your nerves with incessant barking at every passerby?
The safety and sanity of dog-loving households may depend on the care taken in choosing dogs wisely and training them properly. It may also depend on prompt recognition of a developing behavioral problem, exploration of its cause and intervention to modify it, if possible, before a disaster ensues.
Dr. Randall Lockwood of the Humane Society of the United States in Washington, who has been studying the dog bite problem for 25 years, said: "Many people have trouble with their dogs because they acquire animals for the wrong reasons and without knowing their special needs. An increasing percentage of people are using dogs essentially as weapons. Your dog should be your friend, not your gun."
Furthermore, Dr. Lockwood pointed out, as certain breeds surge in popularity, careless breeders who pay little or no attention to the quality of the dogs they breed are creating animals with unstable temperaments as well as physical problems that could prove costly economically and emotionally to their owners. For example, he said, "Rottweilers have grown in popularity sevenfold in 10 years, and we're seeing an increasing number of problems now in what was once a trouble-free breed."
 
Selecting Wisely
Whatever characteristics may be attributed to a particular breed of dog may not apply to every individual, since dogs, like people, have their own personalities. Furthermore, dog lovers are often very loyal to a breed, and may choose it despite certain distressing characteristics. So it is often helpful to consult more than one authority before choosing your pet.
Nonetheless, one very balanced and sensible guide is "The Perfect Puppy: How to Choose Your Dog by Its Behavior," by Dr. Benjamin L. Hart and Linette A. Hart of the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California at Davis. The book, published in 1988 by W. H. Freeman ($11.95), describes 13 behavioral characteristics that could make or break a successful dog-owner relationship, then rates 56 popular breeds on each trait based on the evaluations of 48 veterinarians and 48 obedience judges.
For example, the Scottish terrier (Scottie), a small dog much admired for its perkiness and spunk, ranks very high on excitability, snapping at children, aggression toward other dogs, watchdog barking, destructiveness and domination of its owner, which may prompt it to snap or growl when told to get off the couch. It is also difficult to train. This is hardly an ideal breed for a family with children, a working person who is away all day or an older couple with grandchildren who are seeking a quiet companion.
On the other hand, the Newfoundland dog, though as big as a small bear, is "a cream puff," the Harts wrote: quiet, nonaggressive, nondestructive, very affectionate and highly tolerant of all sorts of disturbances, including the shenanigans of little children and frisky puppies.
Then there is the matter of the sex of the dog. In general, the Harts say, within a given breed, females are less aggressive than males and less likely to snap at children, but they are no less excitable or less likely to bark excessively. Also, neutered males are less aggressive and spayed females are less nervous than hormonally intact animals of the same breed.
Experts are divided on the relative merits of mutts versus pure-breeds. Many dog owners insist that mutts make nicer, less temperamental and physically healthier pets. If you know the parents of the mutt and consider the characteristics of each, you can get a fair idea of the animal's likely behavior as an adult dog.
But Dr. Katherine A. Houpt, director of the Cornell Animal Behavior Clinic in Ithaca, N.Y., cautioned against adopting mutts of mysterious parentage. "You don't know what you're getting in a mixed breed," she said. "You may wind up with the aggressiveness of one breed and the biting tendency of another."
 
Training Your Dog
A dog must be socialized to other dogs and to people. The dog's mother does the former and the mother's human family and the puppy's adoptive family do the latter. To learn doggie rules, a puppy is best kept with its mother for six to eight weeks. During that time, it should be played with often by its owners. But the bulk of orientation into human households occurs after the puppy is adopted.
It is important for the dog to learn who is boss. It is more important for the dog to learn to come when called than to walk at your heel. Obedience training, which is growing in popularity, can help you avoid disruptive and dangerous behavior problems in your pet.
"Training should be a family affair," Dr. Lockwood said. "You don't send the dog off to school without you. You have to go and learn how to work with the dog, and everyone involved in its care should be consistent in the limits set and the techniques used to reinforce good behavior."
One should never have to hit a dog to get it to behave, Dr. Lockwood insists. "In 20 years of watching wolves, I never saw a wolf hit another wolf with a rolled-up newspaper," he remarked. "Violence begets violence. Praise and harsh reprimands are all that should be needed. Dogs want to please their owners, and animals, like people, respond much faster to rewarded outcomes than to punishment."
Also, training is not a one-time affair. "Like child rearing, it's an ongoing experience as the animal ages and situations change," Dr. Lockwood said. "Good obedience training makes you more observant and teaches you how what you do shapes what the dog does. It focuses on problem avoidance and problem solving. By learning parenting skills, you build a bond with your dog and reinforce behavior that is fun, positive and safe."
To find a good trainer, Dr. Lockwood suggests that you check with your local veterinarian, humane society, dog club (if it is not show-oriented) and dog-owning friends. It is important that you be comfortable with the attitudes and methods the trainer uses. If the trainer is too heavy-handed and does not show proper respect for the animals or the owners, leave and find another.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
'Truth' Is Not Stranger Than Fiction: It Is Fiction

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
Who was it who cautioned, believe half of what you see and none of what you hear? If the dispenser of that advice were to see Russ Hexter's "Dadetown," the cynic would be entitled to a good I-told-you-so chortle.
As the final credits roll on this documentary exploration of the forces tearing apart an idyllically picture-perfect small town in upstate New York, it is revealed that the local citizenry was played by actors. A film that has purported to uncover a complex social reality is in fact a brilliant artistic hoax. 
 You might call "Dadetown," which opens today at the Film Forum, a virtual documentary. Some who have been fooled by the film's skillful use of cinema verite techniques to evoke reality have stormed out in a fury of betrayal. After all, isn't it the documentarian's duty to illuminate the historical truths that elude the shallower world of feature films? For those who can't take a joke, Mr. Hexter, who died of an aortic aneurysm in April at the age of 27, may be remembered as an irresponsible prankster or worse, a Judas to his sacred calling.
Beyond the fact that "Dadetown" will instill in anyone who sees it a permanent nagging doubt about the veracity of anything calling itself a documentary, the story it tells is as "real" and compelling as those of many feature films whose audiences eagerly suspend disbelief in the rush to empathize with fictional characters.
The movie, set in the spring of 1994, follows a camera crew that is filming a 20-minute segment for a PBS series called "Small Town America: Where the Heart Was." As unforeseen traumas unravel the town's snug social fabric, the film makers remain in Dadetown to record the damage.
At first Dadetown appears to be a settled, Norman Rockwell-serene community whose economic lifeblood is a metalworking plant that has operated for decades. The local factory workers and their wives proudly reminisce about the glory days of World War II, when the factory produced the fuselage for fighting aircraft. After the war, when it was converted into a metal-bending facility producing staples and paper clips, the plant continued to supply Dadetown with abundant, decent-paying jobs.
But recently, a successful high-tech business, American Peripheral Imaging, has moved its headquarters to the town's outskirts and brought in a new, urban, upscale breed of settler. Eager to ingratiate itself with the longtime residents, American Peripheral has built a children's playground for the community. As the movie begins, there is a peaceful if wary coexistence between the old-timers and the yuppie interlopers in business suits.
When the metal-bending plant begins a series of layoffs, however, some of the unemployed workers irrationally blame American Peripheral. The playground is trashed and the swanky homes of the employees vandalized. When it becomes clear that a cancellation of contracts will force the plant to close, the workers desperately try to organize a union. But after a child is accidentally killed in a shooting accident related to the strike, a deal is made to keep the peace and close the factory.
The gist of "Dadetown" is a chronological series of interviews with longtime residents, factory workers, newcomers and corporate executives, many of them played by nonprofessionals. The film's sense of reality is enhanced by what seem to be spontaneous conversations that allow crucial nuts-and-bolts information about the factory and the town's economy to slip through the cracks. Rapid film editing helps blend the story's disparities and clips off most of the loose ends.
One of the most deceptive (and effective) tricks is to have an actor who is playing a dismissed factory worker lashing out at the camera crew and trying to prevent them from exploiting his private grief. You are reminded that in documentaries as in dramatic films, the cheapest and boldest emotional gestures are the ones paying the highest dividends.
While "Dadetown" succeeds as a fictional film, it also delivers a tough esthetic statement on the artist's relationship to the audience that some will find deeply unsettling. Movies, including documentaries, are, after all, only movies. In compiling and editing their stories, documentarians tend to be as entertainment-driven and manipulative as other film makers. If you've got something that works, you use it.
If "Dadetown" has a storytelling fault, it's that its scenario is too pat, too easy to swallow. We've heard it all in Bruce Springsteen songs. Where the best fiction stretches reality, "Dadetown" merely confirms what passes for it.

Three hotel projects are in the works for downtown Chicago, the first in five years.

BYLINE: By Robert Sharoff 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
AFTER a drought of almost five years in new hotel construction, downtown Chicago now has three projects under way.
The three are a new 800-room Hyatt Regency, a 230-room Hampton Inn and Suites, and a 350-room project that is being carved out of the city's Marina City complex on the Chicago River and will most likely carry the Hilton flag. 
 The three projects will add about 1,380 rooms to the city's current downtown total of about 26,000 hotel rooms.
The new Hyatt Regency is part of the expansion of the city's McCormick Place convention hall complex, which is just south of the Loop along the lakefront. The hotel is costing $108 million, which a Hyatt spokeswoman said was low for a project of that size but attributable to the fact that the hotel -- because of its proximity to the convention center -- will have less than the usual amount of meeting space. In addition to the hotel, the expansion includes a new 850,000-square-foot exhibition hall.
The Hyatt Regency is replacing a smaller hotel, not a Hyatt, that was torn down several years ago. The Hyatt, which will open in the summer of 1998, will be owned by the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority and managed by Hyatt. The architect is Thomas W. Ventulett of Thompson, Ventulett Stainback & Associates. The firm also designed the new exhibition hall.
Hyatt has three other hotels in Chicago, including the city's largest, the 2,000-room Hyatt Regency Chicago.
The other two projects are both in River North, an area north of the Loop, Chicago's central business district. River North has become a tourist destination in recent years. The area is several blocks from the Michigan Avenue shopping district and is also the home of Planet Hollywood, the Hard Rock Cafe and other restaurants and entertainment spots.
"Traditionally, the Chicago hotel market has been based on conventions and business travelers, but the weekend tourist business has really picked up," said Thomas Huffsmith, senior vice president of LaSalle Partners, a downtown commercial real estate company. "There is definitely room for some new middle-market hotel rooms."
According to a recent study LaSalle made of the downtown hotel market, the current occupancy rate is about 70 percent, up from 64 percent last year. During the same period, average room rates climbed 12 percent, to $109.96. "It's a pretty strong market and we think it will continue to grow in 1997," said Todd A. Canter, the author of the study.
The new Hampton Inn and Suites, which will break ground in the next few weeks, will be at Illinois and Dearborn Streets. The 13-story hotel is being developed by Albert Friedman and Stephen L. Schwartz. Mr. Friedman is the president of Friedman Properties Inc. and the largest landlord in River North. Mr. Schwartz is the president of First Hospitality Group Inc., a hotel management company based in the Chicago suburb of Des Plaines.
The hotel, which will have about 100 suites and will be completed late next year, is being aimed at cost-conscious tourists and travelers making extended stays.
"There's a real shortage of extended-stay facilities in Chicago and also a dearth of value-oriented hotels," Mr. Schwartz said. "Most of the hotels that went up in the 80's catered to the upscale market."
According to Arnold Karr, president of the Hotel-Motel Association of Illinois, suite hotels in Chicago "generally do a point or two better than regular hotels" in terms of occupancy and also command a higher average room rate.
The cost of building a hotel in downtown Chicago runs anywhere from $150,000 to $200,000 a room, real estate professionals say. Mr. Friedman said his project would come in at "slightly less" than $150,000 a room.
The third project, as yet unnamed, is under way at the Marina City complex, on the north bank of the Chicago River between State and Dearborn Streets.
The distinctive complex, which was designed by Bertrand Goldberg in the early 1960's, consists of two cylindrical condominium towers, a theater and a 16-story office building. Three years ago, the theater and office building were acquired by John Marks, president of Mark IV Realty, and the NIKI DevelopmentCorporation. The properties are being converted into a hotel and entertainment areas.
The theater, which is to reopen in November, is being taken over by the House of Blues, which will offer live entertainment seven days a week. The 350-room hotel will open next spring. The remaining parts of the project -- a retail and restaurant component -- will be finished in 1998. The total cost of the project is about $75 million.
Mr. Marks is negotiating with the Hilton Hotel Corporation about managing the hotel and he said he was close to a final agreement.
"We're located at the front door of both the financial and entertainment districts," Mr. Marks said. "I think the market for hotels has changed here. The economy is vibrant and people are traveling again. We hope to provide a total urban entertainment experience."

HEADLINE: Somali Gunmen Abduct U.S. Aid Worker

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MOGADISHU, Somalia, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Gunmen abducted an American aid worker today in Mogadishu, the Somali capital.
Daniel Suther of the United States Agency for International Development was traveling with another American and 3 Britons when their vehicle was surrounded by 10 to 15 gunmen who disarmed their bodyguards and took Mr. Suther away in the car. 
 Mohammed Ali Mahdi, the faction leader who controls north Mogadishu, said he was in contact with the abductors and had demanded that Mr. Suther be released. The American Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, confirmed the report.
Kidnappings of aid workers have increased in Mogadishu recently. A Somali working for Unicef and another working for the World Food Program were kidnapped in separate incidents last month. Both were released unharmed.
Chronic unemployment and the lack of commercial activity are blamed for worsening living conditions here. Somalia has had no functioning central Government since the 1991 ouster of dictator Mohammed Siad Barre, when the country disintegrated into warring factions.

Keep It Simple

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
When trying to assess the long-term implications of Saddam Hussein's recent "victory" in northern Iraq, keep in mind the following fact: The Kurds whom Saddam wooed away from the U.S., and forged a partnership with in an effort to reassert his authority in northern Iraq, are the same Kurds whom Saddam bombarded with mustard gas and cyanide in 1988. This is not a relationship with a long future. The relationship between Saddam and the Barzani Kurdish faction has about the same shelf life as an Elizabeth Taylor marriage.
That's why it's actually reassuring to see the Clinton Administration, belatedly, toning down its rhetoric, taking a deep breath and stepping back from the brink of all-out war against Saddam. Yes, the new Kurdish-Saddam alliance is a setback for American policy, but probably only a temporary one and certainly only a limited one. It doesn't change the fact that the U.S. still has Saddam in a strategic box. Washington has no vital interest, no allies and no regional strategy that would justify now trying to break apart Iraq or singlehandedly going to war against it. 
 The vital United States interests are to keep Saddam boxed in, to prevent him from threatening the oilfields in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, to prevent him from savaging the Kurds and to support all reasonable attempts to dispatch him to the next world. All those goals can be accomplished with the current basic U.S. force deployment. Saddam is a chronic rash -- ugly, itchy, occasionally painful, but in his present condition no longer fatal, let alone worth radical, messy surgery with unpredictable results.
The Republicans, desperate to score some points against President Clinton, have been hyperventilating that he squandered the great gulf war coalition. Nonsense. That coalition was held together by two things: oil and nukes. It was not a coalition to protect Kurds. It was not a coalition to take apart Iraq. It was a coalition to protect the oilfields of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia from Iraqi attacks and it was a coalition to prevent Saddam from developing nuclear weapons. That coalition still exists. But a coalition for doing more than that -- like punishing Saddam for maneuvering in northern Iraq -- never existed. The French, the Arabs, the Russians would never sign on to that. So we acted alone. So what? That's the price of leadership. It's also why God created cruise missiles -- for operations without allies.
But the Clinton Administration is also wise to stick to this limited approach because the United States has no larger vision or strategy for the Middle East, and neither does anyone else. There is a strategic vacuum in the Middle East today. In 1991 the end of both the cold war and the gulf war, coupled with a new global emphasis on economic growth, gave the region a new agenda. That new agenda was crystallized in former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres's vision of a "new Middle East," in which Arab-Israeli and Arab-Arab economic development and cooperation would replace confrontation.
Mr. Peres's vision was a romantic one, and everyone liked to poke fun at it. But it actually produced a moderate center in the Middle East and provided a strategic framework for much of what Israel, the Arabs and the U.S. were doing in the region. Everyone reacted to it. Some by opposing it, some by trying to modify it, some by trying to nurture it.
Today the Peres vision is no longer the dominant trend. Yet it has not been replaced by any new vision or agenda. The Arabs have none. The new Israeli Government has none. The new Islamic Government in Turkey has none, and the Clinton Administration has hung an "Out to Lunch, Back on Nov. 6" sign. In this vacuum all the old rivalries and habits are reasserting themselves. There is an all-against-all free-for-all in the Middle East today. Syria and Israel were even reported mobilizing some troops on their common border. We haven't heard that story in years.
When you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there. Right now, no one in the Middle East seems to know where he is going, and everyone is on a different road. In such a moment, the U.S. would be wise to keep its policy toward Iraq simple and tightly focused. It doesn't have the allies, vital interests or road map for anything more.

Bonds Drop As Fed Rate Rise Is Feared

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond investors reacted with alarm yesterday to a report that regional officials of the Federal Reserve were pushing for an increase in interest rates.
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped a full point, to 96 20/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 7.02 percent from 6.94 percent. 
 Market participants said the change in market mood was caused by a Reuters report citing an unnamed person at the Fed, who said the Fed consensus supported an increase of one-quarter of a percentage point in the discount rate at the meeting next Tuesday of the Federal Open Market Committee.
The report also said a consensus was forming for a similar increase in the Federal funds rate, which has a greater effect on the economy.
The same person, identified only as a senior Fed spokesman, said that 8 of the 12 Fed district banks had submitted requests for an increase, with three wanting an increase of half a percentage point.
Earlier reports on industrial production and capacity utilization yesterday, which Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said exceeded expectations, had only a mild impact on the bond market by comparison. Even the weekly Johnson Redbook survey of retail sales, which showed that sales were down one-tenth of 1 percent for the first two weeks of September, made little difference.
Industrial production rose five-tenths of 1 percent in August, led by utilities, mining, computers and office equipment. Capacity utilization rose two-tenth of a percentage point, to 83.5 percent.
"The market, of course, is grappling with the issue as to whether or not the Fed will tighten at the F.O.M.C. meeting next Tuesday," Mr. Fine said.
"There is no shortage of data suggesting a quarter-point increase in the Federal funds rate on Sept. 24, but at the same time, three months of lackluster retail sales and the upcoming Presidential election will likely loom large in the Fed's decision," he said.
But Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber, said, "Having read the Reuters report and reviewed the latest economic evidence, we still do not see the Fed raising short-term interest rates."
Mr. Harris said the requests by the regional Fed banks for rate increases would have been made at various times in recent weeks. That means that some came in before the reports last week of a slight gain of one-tenth of 1 percent in the August Consumer Price Index and soft August retail sales, up two-tenths of 1 percent after a one-tenth of 1 percent gain in July and six-tenths of 1 percent decline in June.
Traders also sold Treasuries yesterday because of worry about getting hurt by hedging activity resulting from the heavy volume of corporate bond issues coming to market.

HEADLINE: Clinton Announces Steps For More Portable Pensions

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Finding campaign fodder in an arcane place, President Clinton today announced steps taken by the Treasury Department to enhance workers' ability to save for retirement even as they move between jobs.
One measure removes barriers to workers rolling retirement savings into the pension plans of new employers. Another allows departing or retiring workers who choose to leave their 401(k) or other savings with the employer to have some investment choice other than money market funds. 
 "What we're doing is to make those retirement plans much, much more portable in ways that benefit both the employees and the employers in the small-business sector of our economy," the President said this morning in an Oval Office ceremony. "When five million workers with pensions change jobs every year, we have to make it easier for them to save."
The initiatives were regarded by pension experts as technical and more or less inevitable but nonetheless of significance as part of a long-running, bipartisan effort to encourage savings and improve job-market mobility by making benefits more portable.
"Both these changes are positive for employees," said Fred Rumack, director of tax and legal issues at Buck Consultants, a New York City-based firm specializing in employee benefits. "They help a lot of people."
Jamie Wickett, tax policy analyst for the National Federation of Independent Business, said, "We're all for pension portability," but reserved judgment on the initiative dealing with investment options for former employees until he had a chance to make sure the Treasury was not imposing new mandates on employers.
The Administration said more than one million workers each year moved to a new employer where rollovers were not accepted and that 50 percent of 401(k) plans did not accept rollovers from new employees. The steps taken today are intended to give employers what the White House called a green light to accept rollovers of retirement savings from people bringing such funds from their preceding jobs.
One reason employers often do not allow such rollovers is fear that their plan may be disqualified or penalized for inadvertently accepting money that proves later to have been ineligible, either because the plan from which it came did not meet the requirements of the tax law or because the rollover was not completed within the required 60 days. One of the Treasury's new guidelines says that a plan that accepts an invalid rollover will be protected against disqualification if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the money was eligible.
Another obstacle is employer worry that rollovers may jeopardize their plan's compliance with rules that bar skewing benefits in favor of the highest-paid employees. The Treasury proposes a regulation declaring that rollovers from new employees, including those not yet eligible to participate in the new employer's plan, will not cause plans to run afoul of the nondiscrimination rules.
Mark Iwry, benefits tax counsel at the Treasury, described today's action as "clarifying the law in areas that had been somewhat uncertain." The uncertainty, it was generally agreed, has inhibited the transfer and therefore the accumulation, of retirement savings.
As for preserving investment options, the Administration offered as an example the case of a woman who worked for many years with a large company and had built up savings of $50,000 in a 401(k) account that was invested in a stock fund returning 7 percent a year over a decade. She then switched to a new employer without any pension plans.
Although the law bars an employer from imposing a "significant detriment" on former employees who keep their savings with their old company, some employers limit their former employees to money-market funds even though active employees have broader choices.
Without the chance to keep investing in, say, stocks, such workers are hurt because they are more likely to "withdraw and dissipate their retirement savings," the Administration said.
The Treasury's new guidance does not bar employers from distinguishing between current and former employees, Mr. Iwry said. Rather, it means that such an extreme position as taking away all the former employee's venturesome investment options is "beyond the pale" if broader alternatives are offered to active employees.
The investment options guidance, Mr. Rumack pointed out, applies only to retirement accounts of more than $3,500. The law allows employers to rid themselves of the chore of administering lesser accounts by having the worker cash out.

HEADLINE: How Schedule Has Worked Elsewhere

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
As he seeks to test a year-round calendar in at least one New York City school district next year, Chancellor Rudy Crew can look to any number of examples nationwide: 2,368 schools, in 39 states, have already adopted a similar schedule, most within the last decade, according to the National Association for Year-Round Education.
For the districts, the allure is twofold. Some, like Trenton, have embraced the idea as a way to shorten the traditional 10-to-12-week summer vacation and extend the school year, giving students more time in school and less to forget what they learned. But others, including Los Angeles, have long used year-round calendars to ease the sort of overcrowding emerging in New York City. Without building a single classroom, a school can expand its capacity a third or more by switching to a year-round calendar. 
 Most schools that have adopted the calendar divide their students into two to five groups and then stagger the groups' schedules so that at least one is out of school at any time. Some students may attend 12 weeks in a row and take off the next 4. Others may attend 9 consecutive weeks and take off the next 3.
About half the schools that have adopted the year-round calendar are in California, with others in Boston, Dallas, Houston and Baltimore. In the Los Angeles Unified School District, second in size only to New York, more than 40 percent of the 660,000 students were on a year-round calendar last year.
Margaret Harrington, the superintendent for high schools in Queens, visited Garfield High School in Los Angeles several years ago and was struck by the school's economic use of space: using a staggered calendar, 4,200 students were taught over the year in a building that had desks for only 3,200.
"I came away impressed," said Dr. Harrington, who at the time was part of a committee studying the issue for Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines. "I thought they were giving the kids a good education."
The calendar also provides schools with some fringe benefits beyond space. In Preston, Idaho, a rural district about 100 miles north of Salt Lake City, students needing remedial education do not have to wait until the summer for a review. They can catch up, on classes they may have failed the first time around, during special makeup sessions held during their vacations.
"The great advantage is learning," said Jerry Waddoups, principal of the Oakwood Elementary School in Preston, which expanded its capacity to 660 students from 530 when it went to a year-round calendar 15 years ago. "These kids do not have a long summer lost to learning."
In many districts, students concerned that taking three weeks off in, say, November, might leave them with little to do are heartened to learn that they can still be involved in after-school sports and clubs.

HEADLINE: After Bitter Debate, Amity on Way to Implement Welfare Law

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
While generally supporting the new welfare law, state officials asked Congress today to give them more latitude and a bit more money to care for poor people and create jobs for welfare recipients.
Whenever Congress debated welfare in the last two years, Republicans and Democrats bitterly denounced each other, and Democrats disagreed among themselves. But today, when a Congressional subcommittee examined efforts to carry out the law signed 26 days ago by President Clinton, the proceedings were notable for the lack of acrimony. 
 Though some had feared that Federal officials might undermine or delay the new law, Republican lawmakers today commended the Administration for being cooperative.
And in brisk, businesslike testimony, Olivia A. Golden, Commissioner of the Federal Administration on Children, Youth and Families, said, "Our job is to implement the legislation as Congress passed it and the President signed it."
Ms. Golden testified in place of Mary Jo Bane, the Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services responsible for welfare programs, who had been scheduled to appear. The Administration pulled Ms. Bane from the lineup of witnesses, fearing that she might be asked to explain why she opposes the welfare law. Ms. Bane said last week that she would step down on Sept. 28 because of "deep concerns" about the law, which ends the 60-year-old Federal guarantee of cash assistance for the nation's poorest children.
At today's hearing, lawmakers focused on the future, not the past. As Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., Republican of Florida, put it -- with some understatement -- "We've been through stormier times."
"You can't keep fighting the Civil War," he said. "It's over. Now it's time for us to do our job. We set new rules. Now it's time for us to make them work."
Representative Shaw, who presided over the hearing as head of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, said: "Good legislation is about 10 percent of what's required to achieve true welfare reform. The other 90 percent is implementation, and that's going to take a lot of cooperation between Democrats and Republicans in Congress.
"The law is the law. We must join together to make it work. As I've said to the President, we are in this together." Mr. Clinton signed the bill over strenuous objections from liberal Democrats who said the nation had a moral obligation to the poor.
There were at least two reasons for the political amity just seven weeks before Election Day. No state has yet felt any hardship, and Democrats did not want to embarrass Mr. Clinton by criticizing the welfare law he cites as an accomplishment.
The law gives states vast new power to run their own welfare and work programs with lump sums of Federal money. But state officials asked Congress to give them a bit more authority, with easier access to and less restrictions on Federal money.
Under the law, each state will receive a fixed amount of Federal money in each of the next six years. A total of $2 billion is set aside in a contingency fund for states with high unemployment. To use the contingency fund, states must maintain welfare spending at 1994 levels.
Susan Golonka, a policy analyst at the National Governors' Association, urged Congress to relax some of the restrictions on the fund, so the money would be more readily available to states experiencing hard times.
A. Sidney Johnson, executive director of the American Public Welfare Association, asked Congress to repeal a requirement for states to continue extra payments they might be making to disabled people who receive Federal aid under the Supplemental Security Income program.
Mr. Johnson, whose group represents state officials, complained that Congress had imposed the requirement without giving the states additional money to carry it out.
Sheri E. Steisel, a policy analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures, told Congress that because of the new law, states would lose Federal money that they now receive to help finance welfare payments to families for whom child support is collected.
The loss of this money will be costly, especially the poorer states, she said, and she urged Congress to restore the money.
Under the old law, many states received permission from the Federal Government to conduct experimental welfare programs. On Aug. 19, after Mr. Clinton had announced his intention to sign the welfare bill, the Department of Health and Human Services approved a 10-year waiver for Washington, D.C.
In general, people who go to work need less money for welfare, and Mr. Shaw said that if Washington or any state tried to circumvent the work requirements, it would probably run short of money for public assistance.
"Congress will not be sympathetic to any state that comes in here with a tin cup and says, 'Welfare reform isn't working,' especially if that state has not done anything to make it work," Mr. Shaw said.

HEADLINE: With Little Fanfare and Facing Crisis, U.N. Starts a New Year

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Its difficult 50th birthday party over, the United Nations opened the 51st session of the General Assembly today without ceremony, in financial crisis and with no idea who its Secretary General will be when this session ends on Dec. 23.
"The United Nations General Assembly begins its 51st session without celebration but amidst criticism of the U.N.'s inability to respond adequately to international crises," the Assembly's new president, Razali Ismail of Malaysia, said in his opening speech. Mr. Razali, an outspoken diplomat who has represented Malaysia here for eight years, said that in this environment, he hoped that the "business as usual" syndrome would go. 
 "Delays and long lunches which lead to more delays, at enormous cost, are over," he said. "So too, I trust, the torture of long, unfocused speeches."
A high point of this annual meeting of leaders of 185 nations will come next Tuesday, when President Clinton plans to be the first to sign a treaty banning all nuclear test explosions. The Clinton Administration has been pressing for the treaty, which was approved by 158 countries a week ago, for the last three years.
Otherwise, it is not such a good time to be an American diplomat or official at the United Nations this year. Washington is responsible for more than half the $2.8 billion debt owed to the organization. Congress has attached conditions to American participation in peacekeeping and other international activities. Republicans and Democrats alike are demanding that Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali step down or be ousted by an American veto.
"It is great to be back from vacation," Mr. Boutros-Ghali said, darkly satirizing his critics at a lunch today. "Frankly, I get bored on vacation. It's much more fun to be at work here blocking reform, flying my black helicopters, imposing global taxes, demoralizing my staff."
When the 50th General Assembly opened a year ago, there were high hopes that the anniversary would spur reform. Working groups representing a range of member states were set up to look at changes in the organization's component parts and how to improve its financial status.
In recent days, however, committee after committee has reported no real progress because of disagreements among member countries. Only the Secretariat, the permanent civil service, has taken steps to cut back on its size and spending.
Changes in the Security Council seem a dead or dying issue because most nations rejected the proposal backed by the Clinton Administration to add Germany and Japan to the Council as permanent members and make room for some major developing nations without the same privileges.
There are no substantive plans for overhauling the General Assembly, now a plodding agglomeration of special interests grown to three times the size it was when the United Nations was founded in 1945. Much of the spending and duplication of efforts for which the United Nations is criticized originates in Assembly resolutions.
"Member states have announced they would reform the organization, but now they must deliver," said Diogo Freitas do Amaral, the Portuguese law professor and political leader who was president of the 50th Assembly. "The world expects this. The issues cannot just be endlessly debated. There must be action. And there must be action soon."
Mr. Razali, the new Assembly president, picked up the theme, saying the "reform process must begin with finding a political consensus on what the U.N. should be and what it can do."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
A Technology for the Virtual Marketplace

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
Electronic commerce on the Internet has not yet reached critical mass, and there is little wonder why. Finding, buying and paying for merchandise on the Internet without having to worry about theft or fraud is a complicated and convoluted process -- one that can sometimes make even the most determined shoppers weep. Some call it "debt by a thousand clicks."
But analysts say a new technology developed by First Virtual Holdings Inc. of San Diego, a leader in digital payment systems, has the potential to transform advertising and simplify the processes of buying and selling on the rapidly growing Internet. First Virtual is supposed to announce details of the system later this week. 
 The First Virtual system, called virtual tags, embeds the transaction process directly into multimedia advertisements that can include animation, sound and even video clips. Consumers can view the sales pitch simply by waving the mouse pointer over the ad. If they like what they see, they can pay for merchandise on the spot, without leaving the World Wide Web page they are viewing. (If it were a newspaper, the system is comparable to being able to touch the ad and buy the leaf blower, without having to stop reading the paper and drive to Wal-Mart.)
The system does not require buyers to install any new software or hardware on their computers, and the process consumes only a few thousand bytes of the computer's memory, only a fraction of the amount used by other systems.
The same technology can also be used to send active advertisements, complete with purchasing options, directly to a customer's electronic mailbox.
"In our opinion, placing the transaction in the ad banner and in the user's electronic mail box will fundamentally change Web economics," said Jack Hidary, president of Earthweb, an Internet software developer and distributor in New York.
To take advantage of the new system, both the buyer and the seller must use First Virtual's transaction system, which currently has only about 175,000 customers and 2,500 merchants -- ranging from virtual shopping malls like Infohaus to the Libertarian Party of Virginia.
To help spread the technology among potentially millions of new electronic consumers, First Virtual has also lined up new financial backers that include the First Data Corporation of Hackensack, N.J., and GE Capital of Stamford, Conn., the finance arm of the General Electric Company. Both are among the leading companies in managing and processing consumer credit systems.
Analysts said that with such backers, along with earlier investors -- First USA Paymentech Inc. and the National Direct Marketing Corporation -- First Virtual now has the potential to distribute the capability to make electronic payments to millions of credit card-wielding computer users.
First Virtual also has technical backing from other computer industry leaders including Sun Microsystems, Electronic Data Systems, Science Applications International and Sybase, which together developed the underlying technical structure needed for handling thousands of transactions simultaneously. Until recently, First Virtual's processing system was unable to process more than a relatively few transactions at once.
The virtual tags developed by First Virtual are extensions of the Java programming language created by Sun Microsystems. Java allows developers to create miniature programs that can be run on any computer that can use the latest Internet Web-browsing software, of which the Netscape Communication Corporation's Navigator and the Microsoft Corporation's Internet Explorer are the most popular. The Java extensions will enable advertisers and merchants to create ads that literally sing and dance on the computer screen -- and then take the customer's money.
In the case of digital products like information, music or news, the merchandise is delivered directly to the consumer after the purchase. In the case of hard goods like shoes or books or leaf blowers, the merchant can ship the merchandise to the buyer's address.
"We're moving the Internet and electronic commerce from buyer pull to seller push -- and doing it in a way that is easy for the customer," said Lee H. Stein, First Virtual's chairman and chief executive.
First Virtual has plenty of competition in the Internet electronic payment arena, ranging from established players like Microsoft, Intuit and Checkfree to such start-ups like Cybercash. But First Virtual's new technology appeared in private demonstrations to offer a combination of security and ease of use that others have not yet introduced.
"First Virtual has a significant technology lead," said Karl Jacob, president and chief executive of Dimension X, an Internet software company in San Francisco that specializes in making tools for Web developers. "From what we've seen, they have a good chance of sweeping the Net with their technology."
In the First Virtual process, unlike other Internet security systems, the consumer's actual financial information and credit card numbers are never transmitted on the public Internet. Instead, the information travels as electronic mail on the existing secure networks that banks and other financial institutions use to exchange data. Only the user's First Virtual code name and "virtual PIN" -- personal identification number, which costs $2 a year -- are transmitted on the Internet.
An intruder hoping to use someone else's First Virtual account information for a fraudulent transaction would have to gain access to the buyer's private electronic mailbox and intercept at least two E-mail messages -- one from First Virtual to the consumer, and a second with the confirmation message to the consumer from the merchant. Such two-step interceptions are highly unlikely, security experts say.
"It is very cool stuff," said John W. Noerenberg, director of engineering for the electronic mail division of Qualcomm Inc. of San Diego, which makes the popular Eudora E-mail program. "I am very impressed with the idea that you have a tag that is not just an advertisement or a link to someplace else, but a call to action. It fundamentally changes the nature of the relationship between the merchant and the customer."
Advertisements employing virtual tags are expected to begin appearing on the Web before the end of the year.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE VOTERS;
Dole's Tax Message Heard, Not Heeded, in Midwest City

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: SAGINAW, Mich., Sept. 15

 BODY:
Only a day after Bob Dole's "Citizen's Ship" had whisked the Republican Presidential candidate in and out of this once-battered industrial corner of Michigan, it seemed as if everyone in Saginaw had seen the image the Dole campaign wanted them to see: Mr. Dole, in a gesture of Reaganesque simplicity, holding a nickel aloft to symbolize how he would go about cutting the Federal budget.
"Five cents!" he had shouted to the airport crowd, a scene that local television stations in Michigan ran again and again over the weekend. "All I have to do is take 5 cents out of a dollar to pay for this package," he said, insisting that would be enough to pay for a tax cut of 15 percent while paying off the deficit Washington has run up over the last 15 years. Mr. Dole's handlers were delighted with the headline the next morning in The Saginaw News: "Dole Clarifies 15 Percent Solution." 
 But when neighbors in the Heritage Square section of this ethnically and politically mixed city gathered for coffee and muffins one morning this weekend, not one of them, even Republicans who said they liked and trusted Mr. Dole and would probably vote for him, said they found his central message credible.
This isn't the 1980's, they complained. Michigan's economy, fueled by the automobile industry, has roared back. In fact, the survivors of the General Motors downsizing here are now working too much overtime, they assert. As a result, they say Mr. Dole's economic message seems off the point, focusing on taxes rather than on what they want to hear: how to hang onto their jobs in the next recession, how to cope with competition from low-wage labor abroad and how to make sure their children know how to use computers .
In interviews conducted after Mr. Dole's economic tour of Ohio, Michigan and Illinois last week, including talks with workers in factories and offices that the candidate visited, people said they were not surprised that Mr. Dole's carefully targeted message was failing to gain much traction.
"Forget the damn tax cut," was the advice offered by William E. Fentress, a manager in Cincinnati Milacron's purchasing department, after Mr. Dole visited the company last Thursday.
As his co-workers around the fax machine nodded in agreement, Mr. Fentress added, "We should use that money to get rid of the deficit first."
Here in Saginaw, Mr. Dole's effort to reduce his message to a camera-ready scene -- 15 percent -- has yielded more frustration than votes. "It's not that people around here wouldn't vote for a Republican, because there's not much loyalty to any party," said James W. Woolfolk 2d, who has lived here since 1971 and runs a manufacturing services unit at one of the General Motors plants. "But you don't get any details from Dole. Clinton's got problems, but at least he has talked about energizing the economy."
Mr. Dole's campaign aides say it is too early to judge how well his economic ideas are getting through, a process that they hope to accelerate this week with the publication of a book detailing his plans to cut capital gains taxes in half, create "opportunity scholarships" for secondary school students and balance the budget. "We're confident that once the message sinks in, things will turn around," said Dave Doyle, the campaign's senior consultant for the Midwest.
But the growing view that Mr. Dole's tax plan is unworkable, many voters say, has colored their view of their rest of his initiatives.
"Five cents on the dollar does not come out to a 15 percent tax cut," said Gregory Largent, the director of music ministries at a Saginaw church. Mr. Largent's taxes would be reduced by at least $1,000 under Mr. Dole's plan for a family tax credit, but he drew a laugh from his neighbors the other day when he gave an arch description of Mr. Dole's claim that by cutting capital gains taxes the Government would release "$7 trillion in capital that's now tied up."
"It's not like Anna and I sit around every night and say, 'You know, I think we can release our capital gains now,' " Mr. Largent said. "That's not a conversation many people in this city are going to have."
The comments of Mr. Largent and his neighbors make clear that part of Mr. Dole's problem is that he is running a campaign that seems out of tune with the economic mood of industrial states like Michigan. Both here and around the country, the former Senator from Kansas has made the case that the economy is fundamentally on the wrong track. But poll after poll shows that many voters who might have agreed with him a year ago now have a different view.
In a New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted earlier this month, 69 percent described the economy as "very" or "fairly" good. The same poll showed 55 percent approving the way President Clinton has handled the economy, the highest rating in his four years in office, and the first time a majority of Americans have given him credit for the turnaround.
If ever there was a state where the tax message should sell, it should be here in Michigan, where a Republican Governor, John Engler, touts his combination of tax-cutting, budget-paring and reduced welfare benefits as spurring the state's phenomenal economic revival. The unemployment rate in Michigan is down to 4.5 percent, and it is increasingly difficult to find factory space.
Michigan's success is almost working against Mr. Dole. In good times, and when inflation is not propelling workers into higher tax brackets, the tax bite is a less compelling issue than it was for Ronald Reagan. And there is an inchoate fear of large Federal budget deficits that did not exist in the 1980's, a fear that Mr. Dole himself fueled as one of the Senate's leading deficit hawks.
Mr. Dole's economic plan goes well beyond the 15 percent tax cut: He talks of the need to boost American economic growth and to cut government bureaucracy.
But Mr. Dole rarely talks long about how to fuel that growth beyond cutting taxes. And even when he has obvious opportunities to talk about worker retraining, or anxieties about jobs headed to Mexico or China, or coping with global competition, he usually passes them by.
Such omissions were particularly evident last Thursday afternoon as the candidate conducted one of his "Listening to America" question-and-answer sessions on the lawn at Cincinnati Milacron, one of the nation's leading makers of machine tools.
The Dole campaign had asked to use the company as a backdrop for the event because of its nearly miraculous rise from the corporate dead to a company that has beaten back some of Japan's fiercest manufacturers, and now exports half of what it makes. He spent 20 minutes touring the plant with the company's chairman, Dan Meyer, who said later that the two "talked about international competition and globalization at length."
But when Mr. Dole emerged for the forum, he never mentioned either subject, and only raised worker retraining to declare that he would "throw out the bad programs" financed by the Federal Government and pass the rest of the money down to the states.
"It was bizarre," a Milacron senior executive said later, asking not be quoted by name because the company's leadership had agreed to act as Mr. Dole's host. "It was as if this was a television stage, not a company that faced real-life problems."
Much the same happened the next morning at Hill Manufacturing, a small truck manufacturer outside Toledo, Ohio, that produces military vehicles and builds part of Volvo's trucks. After Mr. Dole talked for roughly an hour about his economic plan, Dave Abbott, an electrical maintenance worker at the company, said he would "watch Dole a lot more carefully" now that the candidate had stopped by. But in the next breath he worried that Mr. Dole had spent so much time on the tax plan that he had "skimmed right by the problems."
"The economy's going good now and we're working a lot of overtime," said Mr. Abbott, who is 41. "But our factory is full of 30- to 50-year-olds, and most of the workers are scared. They're bringing in all these lasers and robot machines to do the welding, and these young guys who come in here know how to run all the computers."
In Washington, at the Dole campaign headquarters, John Buckley, the communications director, said, "The message of empathy is over what workers are dealing with -- paying more in taxes than our society has ever paid before." He added that Mr. Dole was fully briefed about the companies and communities he visits, but "he is not a retail politican selling the prescription for a particular community."
People here vividly remember the mid-1980's and early 90's, when unemployment ran upwards of 15 percent and ravaged the city's center. But today, with the unemployment rate at 4.5 percent, managers everywhere complain that they cannot find enough skilled workers.
Almost everyone in Heritage Square here says they would welcome a tax cut, but they fear that Mr. Dole's plan is so large that sooner or later they will be paying for it in other taxes. Several people said that is what happened after Michigan cut its income and property taxes, only to raise sales taxes and reassess many houses at a higher value.
"There's an assumption that we're going to have to shell out someplace," said Jon Manning, who works for a not-for-profit human services group and moved here three years ago with his wife, Robin.
Mrs. Manning said she was one of the few in the neighborhood who drove out to the airport the other day to hear Mr. Dole. But she found it "less than convincing," she said, adding, "It would be nice to think that you could balance the budget by cutting 5 cents out of every dollar, but I think we're beyond that."

GRAPHIC: Photos: Jon and Robin Manning said they had doubts about Mr. Dole's economic plan. Mrs. Manning said she found it "less than convincing." Gregory Largent, a church music director, doubts Mr. Dole's tax plan would have much effect. With him was his daughter, Elizabeth, 9. James W. Woolfolk 2d, a services unit manager for General Motors in Saginaw, Mich., says Bob Dole is short on details about his tax cut plans. (Photographs by George Waldman for The New York Times)(pg.

HEADLINE: Push at Fed For Rate Rise Is Reported

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
A report that inflation hawks within the Federal Reserve are pressing for a rate increase took some of the wind out of the financial markets today and provided more evidence of the conflicting pressures buffeting the Fed as it prepares for a key policy-making meeting next Tuesday.
A report from Chicago by the Reuters news agency quoted a "senior Fed official" as saying that 8 of the 12 Federal Reserve district banks were in favor of raising the largely symbolic discount rate and that a consensus was forming for a quarter-point increase in the more important Federal funds target rate. 
 Fed officials declined to comment on the report. If true, such a disclosure would represent a highly unusual leak of the Fed's thinking just a week before a policy meeting. Still, the report was consistent with the comments in recent weeks by many of the regional Fed bank presidents, who tend to take a hard line on inflation.
Investors, who in recent days had increasingly taken the view that the Fed would leave monetary policy unchanged next week, sold bonds today on resurgent concerns of a rate increase, sending the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond up to 7.02 percent from 6.94 percent. Stocks also faltered after a series of strong performances last week, with the Dow Jones industrial average slipping 40 points during the day then rebounding to close down by 0.37 point at 5,888.83.
The report said that the Minneapolis, Richmond and San Francisco district banks were pushing particularly hard for a tighter policy by calling for a half-point increase in the discount rate, with five others calling for a quarter-point increase. The president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, Gary H. Stern, was the lone member of the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee to favor raising the Fed funds rate at the July meeting.
The likelihood of a Fed tightening appeared decline over the last several days, particularly after a series of economic indicators last week showed almost no sign of renewed inflation despite strong growth rates and low unemployment.
But figures issued today by the Fed on industrial output and capacity use at mines, factories and utilities in August, provided ammunition for those arguing for a rate increase.
Industrial production rose by a larger-than-expected five-tenths of a percent in August, the fifth consecutive monthly increase, even though output of autos and other consumer goods weakened. A rebound in utility and mining output drove the increase, which followed a gain of a tenth of a percent in July. Analysts had expected an increase of three-tenths of a percent for August. The plant-use rate rose to 83.5 percent in August from 83.3 percent in July.
At the very least, today's reports hint that there will be a vigorous debate at next Tuesday's meeting between those who think the Fed should tighten monetary policy to head off inflation before it infects the economy and those who believe the economy is slowing quickly enough to dissipate any inflationary pressures on its own.
Although it left rates unchanged at its July meeting, the Fed voted to lean toward tightening, a signal that it was on heightened inflation alert. It again left rates unchanged at its August meeting after what some officials said was a heated meeting.
"We know that there are a number of F.O.M.C. members -- and we knew this before today's report -- who feel the time has come to be tighter than we have been," said Stuart Hoffman, the chief economist at the PNC Corporation in Pittsburgh. "It's just not clear whether that's a majority opinion. A consensus is forming that the Fed will need to raise the funds rate and do a little light tapping on the monetary brake, and it's just a question of whether it happens at this meeting or takes a couple of months."
Several Fed officials have said in the last week that they are still not certain whether there is an imminent risk of inflation.
With unemployment down to 5.1 percent, its lowest in seven years, and the economy growing at a relatively robust pace, economists have been searching for any sign that recent wage gains are translating into higher prices. So far, there have been none. Those who contend that inflation is just a matter of time once wages start rising, continue to agitate for action now, even as more moderate members remain on the fence, at least publicly.
"We certainly anticipate a slowdown in the second half, but given how low unemployment is, we need to see it happen quickly," Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, said on Friday. "The economy is slowing down, but the jury is still out on whether it is happening with sufficient speed and to a sufficient degree."
The district bank presidents do not get a vote on whether to change the discount rate, which is set by the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. But their reported request is a clear signal that the banks will push hard for an increase in the Federal funds rate, by the open market committee, where they do have votes.
The discount rate, the rate the Fed charges for overnight loans to banks, has remained at 5 percent since Jan. 31, when it was lowered by a quarter- point. The Fed funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans, has also been unchanged since Jan. 31, when the Fed lowered it a quarter-point, to 5.25 percent.

Japan Trade Surplus Fell 31% In August From August '95

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Sept. 18

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus fell 31 percent in August from the monthly level a year earlier, to $3.35 billion, the 21st consecutive month of such declines, the Finance Ministry said today.
A more limited measure, the merchandise surplus with the United States, which has been a source of friction between the two economic powers, declined 16.9 percent, to $2.02 billion in August, from a year earlier. The figures were not adjusted for seasonal factors. 
 Still, the trade surplus was higher than analysts had predicted. But the pace of shrinkage in the surplus is expected to slow toward year's end, reflecting the yen's sharp decline against the dollar from its level a year ago -- something that has helped Japanese manufacturers regain some competitiveness abroad.
The weaker yen, coupled with recent economic data, have convinced many analysts that the Japanese economy was continuing to recover from a prolonged recession.
On Tuesday, Bloomberg Business News quoted Finance Minister Wataru Kubo as saying that the Government was reluctant to provide another supplementary-spending package to stimulate the economy. "The G.D.P. data hasn't changed the Government view that a gradual recovery is continuing," Mr. Kubo said at a news conference.
Officials reported last Friday that the economy shrank seven-tenths of 1 percent in the April-June quarter from the previous three months, the first such quarterly decline since late in 1994. That translates into a 2.9 percent annual contraction.
Mr. Kubo said the decline last quarter was partly due to the first quarter's strong 12.7 percent annual growth, which might have been a result of extra calendar days in a leap year.
Mr. Kubo said he discussed the possibility of a supplementary package with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on their way to Okinawa for a visit. He added that a decision had yet to be made whether to continue two trillion yen in special tax cuts -- $1.8 billion -- in effect since 1994 into the next fiscal year.
Asked about a report in Japan's leading financial newspaper, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, on Sunday that the Government planned to schedule one trillion yen in public works spending this year that was originally intended for the next fiscal year, Mr. Kubo said he had not heard of such a plan.
He added, Bloomberg said, that Japanese business was not necessarily in favor of further public works spending. And he said that in the second half of the current fiscal year, there is as much public works spending scheduled as in the comparable period last year.
Many traders and investors seem to have interpreted the recent economic statistics as good news for corporate earnings and a sign that the modest recovery was continuing. Coupled with some record closes in United States equity markets, the news has caused Japanese stocks to surge recently.

HEADLINE: EXISTING LEADERS OF ETHNIC GROUPS WIN BOSNIAN VOTE

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Bosnian voters handed power to the existing leaders of the country's three major ethnic groups, election returns indicated tonight, giving the former enemies the task of cooperating in a three-member presidency to govern a restructured nation.
 According to official but incomplete results, the winner with the most votes is the Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, a Muslim, who by virtue of his plurality will be chairman of the presidency for its two-year term. 
Momcilo Krajisnik, a Bosnian Serb separatist, will be the ethnic Serb representative on the presidency, and Kresimir Zubak, an ethnic Croat who promised during the campaign to unite his group's enclave with Croatia, will fill the Croatian seat.
One seat on the presidency was reserved for each ethnic group.
The returns were reported by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Robert Frowick, the head of the organization's mission in Bosnia, said final results for the presidential race would be announced on Wednesday.
Results of the votes for national and regional parliaments, which were held Saturday along with the presidential balloting, are to be announced in the next few days.
Based on the tally available tonight, with 80 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Izetbegovic received 629,439 votes. Mr. Izetbegovic has fought to preserve a unified, multi-ethnic Bosnia but has been criticized for wanting the country to remain under the umbrella of Muslim leadership. His main challenger, former Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, received 110,845 votes,
Mr. Krajisnik, who during this country's four-year war worked closely with Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political leader who has been indicted on war-crime charges, received 508,026 votes, officials said. Mr. Krajisnik's chief rival, the moderate Mladen Ivanic, was shown to have mounted a strong challenge as the counting neared its end, receiving 240,000 votes. The fact that Mr. Ivanic did so well prevented Mr. Krajisnik from getting more votes than Mr. Izetbegovic.
Certain powers are reserved for the presidency, which will determine foreign policy and handle issues like foreign trade, transportation and communication links, in what American officials say is an effort to help unify Bosnia.
Duties like defense will be parceled out to the Muslim-Croat federation and the Bosnian Serb republic, and each will have its own army.
In an interview today, Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum said, "Hundreds of people now have some kind of democratic mandate." He referred not only to the presidency, but also to the legislatures.
"This hasn't existed before," Mr. Kornblum said. "This election will build structures where people not only can but have to work together." He said the vote would transform Bosnia from a "wartime society" to "a normal civil society."
"I am absolutely convinced that a lot of this anger and hatred will be rounded off and fade away as there are more civilian and economic links," he said.
But many Western diplomats say that with the nationalists in charge, it is unlikely that the hundreds of thousands of refugees who were driven from their homes by war will return to those areas.
Critics also questioned whether these bitter enemies would be able to rule by consensus, as is the plan. And they said that with the Croatian and Serbian leaders bent on seceding and Mr. Izetbegovic bent on uniting Bosnia under Muslim control, the governing body might become swiftly paralyzed.
In the next few days, officials expect the tallies for the national Parliament, the two regional parliaments and two regional presidents, one for the Bosnian Serb republic and one for the Muslim-Croat federation.
There was no indication that the various opposition parties, which failed to garner significant votes for the national presidency, fared better in the legislative races.
The presidency will take power the day after the vote count is certified by the European security organization, which could take place as early as Monday. The three members of the presidency are to meet in Sarajevo the day after certification.
But Western diplomats said it was unclear whether Mr. Krajisnik would agree to meet in Sarajevo, his former home. The fact that the city is under Muslim control deeply angers him. He led a campaign by Bosnian Serb leaders to drive 50,000 Serbs out of the city in the days before five neighborhoods and suburbs were handed over to the Muslim-led Bosnian Government last spring as part of the peace agreement reached in Dayton, Ohio.
Mr. Krajisnik has demanded that they meet in the NATO-patrolled zone that separates the Bosnian Serb republic from the Muslim-Croat federation, a request that United States officials have rejected.
The results have also thrown Mr. Izetbegovic's Democratic Action Party into disarray. Some leading members see the vote as solidifying partition.
They are pushing President Izetbegovic to contest the results in the Serbian-held part of Bosnia, where those who carried out the campaigns of ethnic cleansing and were responsible for the murder of thousands of civilians are set to retain power.
Senior officials of Mr. Izetbegovic's party say they are worried that once the Bosnian Serb legislature is in place, it will vote to secede.
"Our biggest concern is how the Republika Srpska will cooperate," said a senior Western diplomat. "There does seem to be this real problem with Krajisnik and his return to Sarajevo. Secondly, we are concerned with the unique decision-making process here. Everything has to be decided six times, with increasing pressure, tension and emotion."
Ten days after the election certification, the United Nations Security Council is permitted to lift economic sanctions on Serbia.
The Bosnian presidency will nominate a cabinet and oversee the seating of the national Parliament and the setting up of the national administration.
American officials are pushing Mr. Izetbegovic to nominate a Serb to a high position in the Government, perhaps to serve as prime minister. After being confirmed by Parliament, the prime minister will nominate the cabinet, which is also subject to Parliament's approval.
All posts are scheduled to be filled by the end of October.
The three presidency members will serve for two years. New elections in two years will choose members who will serve four-year terms.
The structure of the presidency resembles the one that governed Yugoslavia in the years before it broke up. The Yugoslav Presidency proved to be ineffective and ultimately saw the feuding ethnic factions plunge the old Yugoslav federation into war.
If a consensus cannot be reached, Bosnia's new Constitution permits two of the three members to make a decision. But if the third believes that the decision damages the vital interest of his ethnic group, he can appeal to the parliament of the Bosnian Serb republic or the Muslim-Croat federation.
If the objection is upheld by a two-thirds vote in either legislature, the presidency's decision is overturned.
Mr. Krajisnik has little faith in the system he is to join in leading.
"They only way this three-person presidency will work," he said in an interview, "is if it is a thin roof over three enclaves, a roof designed to link our transportation and communication systems and nothing else."

Ford Labor Contract Goes Against Big 3 Trend
The new contract between Ford and the United Automobile Workers runs counter to a trend in which Detroit's auto makers have halved their work forces during the last 15 years partly by closing or selling parts factories, while buying more auto parts from nonunion suppliers.
The new contract requires Ford to guarantee a minimum number of union jobs, while adding incentives for the company to produce more auto parts itself. The U.A.W. will let Ford pay lower wages in any new parts businesses it enters. [Page A1.]

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DEMOCRAT;
Clinton, in Midwest, Takes Page From Reagan's 'Morning in America' Drive

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: FLOSSMOOR, Ill., Sept. 17

 BODY:
Eighteen months ago, President Clinton's election strategists sat down and studied Ronald Reagan's "Morning in America" campaign of 1984 to learn how one of the few recent incumbent Presidents to win a second term had used mood and imagery to sail to a landslide victory.
What the Clinton camp derived from that study has rarely been more evident than it was today, when the President stumped at a vocational education center and a high school in two battleground states of the Midwest. 
 Making no mention of his opponent, Mr. Clinton instead painted a picture of a future America so promising that the young people of today will be doing "jobs that have not been invented yet," in many cases "work that has not been imagined yet."
The appearances marked the beginning of a four-day campaign swing that will carry Mr. Clinton from the bellwether states of the Midwest to Oregon and Washington, both of which he won in 1992 and must capture again. In between, he will take advantage of the most glorious, and quintessentially American, campaign backdrop imaginable, the Grand Canyon.
That will be the second time in two weeks that he has shown up in Arizona, which has voted for Republicans for President for 48 years. Mr. Clinton is trying for a historic upset there, but, even if he ultimately fails to carry the state, his visits have already had one desired effect: Bob Dole campaigned in Arizona today, spending precious time in a place his party has rarely had to contest.
For the cross-country trip from Oregon back to the White House, Mr. Clinton has also tacked on a likely stop in South Dakota, another state where Democrats do not usually bother to tread.
The "Morning in America" approach that was evident in Mr. Clinton's appearances today is not a perfect echo of 1984. The Clinton campaign did not copy everything it learned, and the President, of course, has far different themes to strike. He is running against a Republican Congress full of lawmakers who consider themselves Reagan heirs. And when he campaigns against Mr. Dole's $548 billion tax-cut plan, he is in essence on the stump against Reaganism reborn: the Dole plan was intended to recapture the excitement that Mr. Reagan's call for tax cuts once generated.
Still, to see clearly how Mr. Clinton's technique owes a large debt to Mr. Reagan, one has only to read the memorandum that months ago caught the eye of Ann F. Lewis, the President's deputy campaign manager. It is a plan written in 1984 by a Republican strategist, Stuart Spencer, and later republished in campaign tomes.
"The tone of the campaign should be upbeat, but not so confidently optimistic that we are vulnerable to the charge we believe things are better than facts warrant," Mr. Spencer wrote in the "Proposed Plan to Re-elect the President."
"The future vision the President establishes should include challenges," Mr. Spencer advised, "but reaffirm our faith in the country's ability to progress and meet those challenges."
Mr. Clinton's State of the Union Message in January was in fact made up of "challenges" to America, which have been spoken about throughout his whole campaign.
That theme, aides say, was not directly inspired by Mr. Spencer's 1984 plan. But early this year Mr. Clinton also chose to put more emphasis on the nation's good economic statistics than on growing income disparities, adopting a "Morning in America"-type message of economic resurgence instead of attacking corporate greed as some in his White House had recommended.
And today, in search of the Reagan Democrats who deserted the party in the 1980's, Mr. Clinton fairly bubbled over with the kind of optimism that was a trademark of the Republican who made America feel good about itself. In appearances on school grounds here in the Chicago suburbs and in Westland, Mich., near Ypsilanti, he mixed one of his favored themes, education, with those of patriotism, optimism and healthy economic data.
"I can tell you, I'm more optimistic today than the day I took the oath of office," the President told a boisterous crowd of thousands on the football field of John Glenn High School in Westland. "I am more idealistic today than I was when I took the oath of office, because I know today from seeing what has happened in the last four years that there is nothing you cannot do if you are given the tools to do the job."

HEADLINE: Chrysler Averts a Walkout by Canadian Union

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Chrysler Canada Ltd. averted a strike tonight when it reached a tentative agreement with the Canadian Auto Workers union about 90 minutes before workers were set to walk off their jobs.
"Who says you can't move mountains?" Basil E. Hargrove, the union's president, said. The talks had stalled earlier over the issue of outsourcing, or relying on outside nonunion suppliers for parts. 
 A strike would have cut the Chrysler Corporation's North American supply of its minivans and full-size cars. Chrysler Canada operates three assembly plants and two parts plants. About 60 percent of Chrysler's popular Dodge and Plymouth minivans are made in Windsor, Ontario. The rest are built in St. Louis.
The agreement includes a two percent wage increase for Chrysler's workers in each year of the three-year contract. The tentative deal will also give workers an additional 10 paid days off over the life of the three-year agreement. Mr. Hargrove estimated that Chrysler would have to hire as many as 300 people to make up for that time.
The 12,600 union members are expected to ratify the deal on Sunday.
The agreement comes after the Ford Motor Company and the United Auto Workers agreed to a new three-year contract in the United States.
Outsourcing to suppliers that pay far lower wages than the auto makers was a key issue in both countries.
Chrysler Canada and the C.A.W. agreed on outsourcing earlier today. Chrysler Canada said it would not cut job levels if it contracts out work as long as the company makes a profit, Mr. Hargrove said.
Negotiators had not even begun bargaining on the economic package until Tuesday.
"Everything was like pulling teeth out of tigers," Mr. Hargrove said.
The Canadian union's strategy is to use the Chrysler Canada contract as a blueprint for deals with Ford Canada and the General Motors Corporation.

HEADLINE: U.A.W.'s Pact At Ford Aims At Downsizing

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 17

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company's new three-year labor contract with the United Automobile Workers union addresses two issues that have haunted organized labor for more than a decade: layoffs and moves by companies to rely more on outside suppliers.
The new contract, reached Monday evening, requires Ford to guarantee a minimum number of union jobs, while adding incentives for the company to produce more auto parts itself. 
 Interestingly, the agreement comes at a time when many large companies, including auto makers, are downsizing their work forces to try to cut costs and deliver more value to shareholders. Detroit's auto makers have halved their work forces over the last 15 years partly by closing or selling parts factories, while buying more parts from nonunion suppliers.
In exchange for the employment guarantee, the U.A.W. will let Ford pay permanently lower wages in any new auto parts businesses it enters.
What remains unclear is whether the Ford deal will set a precedent for other companies, inside and outside the industry. Only a tenth of the nation's private-sector work force is unionized and there are few other unions that are so powerful.
The first test for the union will come quickly as it tries to impose similar settlements on the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation. Analysts said G.M. in particular would be hard pressed to accept such a deal because the company was trying to cut its work force and rely less on its own auto parts manufacturing operations.
And beyond the auto makers, the Ford contract might have much weaker influence, even in those industries in which the U.A.W. represents workers. For example, Caterpillar Inc., a maker of heavy equipment, was able to hire replacement workers and continue doing business last year despite a U.A.W. strike.
"I think that may be the model to look at, rather than Ford," said Sharon F. Canner, the vice president for human resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers.
Under the new contract, Ford has guaranteed that for the next three years, the number of U.A.W.-represented workers in each factory will stay at 95 percent or more of current levels. With Ford's 105,000 U.A.W. workers retiring at a rate of 5 to 6 percent a year, the pact will force Ford to hire thousands of workers to replace the retirees and will keep overall employment high.
The new rules guaranteeing minimum employment make it much less attractive for Ford to continue farming out the manufacture of parts to outside suppliers, Wall Street analysts said. Ford would still have to employ just as many workers even if there was no work for them to do.
Indeed, the new contract may have its greatest impact on the immense auto parts industry that has grown up to supply the growing needs of auto makers. According to the Commerce Department, there were 711,000 Americans working in the industry last year producing $131 billion worth of parts, although the auto makers' own remaining parts factories accounted for about a quarter of these totals.
When a dozen senior executives from auto parts suppliers met over coffee and danishes at a riverfront hotel here this morning, they were upset about the new rules at Ford, said Donna L. Parolini, a consultant who attended the monthly gathering. "If they can't lay off any people, what does that do for us? Nothing -- that's what they were saying," Ms. Parolini said later.
The new arrangement could still run into problems. The U.A.W. long resisted lower wages for auto parts workers, fearing friction between low-wage and high-wage workers in the same union. But that friction could now be limited given that the low-wage workers will be mainly in new Ford factories and may seldom meet high-wage workers.
In an interview on Sept. 5, Alexander Trotman, Ford's chairman, chief executive and president, said Ford would be more interested in entering new parts businesses if the union allowed lower wages. "To the degree that we can figure out how to make widgets much more effectively than we do today, it increases the likelihood we're going to make more of those widgets and even make widgets we're not making today."
G.M. already makes many of its own parts, and so has fewer opportunities to move into new parts operations at lower wages. Thus, it has less incentive to sign such a contract.
In addition, G.M. uses more workers to produce each vehicle than its rivals do, and it wants to pare its work force sharply through attrition. So guaranteed job levels will be a tougher sell to G.M. executives.
The union may respond by showing some flexibility in negotiating with G.M. on the definition of new auto parts, people close to the union said today. That would allow G.M. to call a product new and move production to lower-wage factories.
The new Ford pact has a complex clause giving Ford an extra incentive to increase its overall work force quickly by moving into auto parts businesses, people with a detailed knowledge of the contract said. For every three low-wage workers Ford hires in the new parts factories, the company will be allowed to let two high-wage workers retire without replacing them, even if this means going below the 95 percent floor on employment levels at existing assembly plants and parts factories.
The contract also allows Ford to negotiate a breach in the 95 percent threshold if a recession badly hurts the company. Previous labor pacts have required auto makers to continue paying most of the wages of laid off workers, but have not guaranteed levels of employment.
Detroit's auto makers currently pay about $19 an hour to assembly workers and parts workers alike. Outside parts companies pay $8 to $17 an hour, depending on the product. The Ford pact would let it pay the same wage in its new parts factories as the better-paying outside makers of the same product.
The U.A.W. has a long history of seeking innovations in industry pattern-setting deals with Ford. Henry Ford 2d, who ran the company from 1945 to 1980, agreed to many new fringe benefits, like fully financed pensions, first granted in 1949.
Peter J. Pestillo, an executive vice president at Ford, has shaped the labor policies of Ford and the entire auto industry since 1980. People close to the U.A.W. said that Mr. Pestillo and Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W.'s president, drafted this year's innovative contract.
The many provisions in Ford's contract to discourage corporate downsizing and outsourcing, or the use of outside suppliers, come at a time when both practices have become buzzwords for politicians and some business leaders critical of numerous layoffs in the last decade.
While G.M. is still moving to buy more parts from outside vendors, Ford and Chrysler have found some of these suppliers to be unreliable.
Chrysler lost millions of dollars last year when it had to delay the introduction of a new line of mini-vans because a 16-employee company in Toledo, Ohio, fell behind on orders for a machine vital to the production of front suspensions.
Ford has closed one of its most profitable factories for all of this week because the Dana Corporation, a large parts supplier, could not make enough metal underbody frames to keep up with a surge in demand for F-150 pickup trucks with four-wheel drive.
Gary Corrigan, a spokesman for Dana, said it was working quickly to make more frames. He predicted that even with the new labor contract, auto makers would buy more and more parts from suppliers like Dana.
But Ms. Parolini said that other auto suppliers were more worried.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 19, 1996, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day yesterday listing some provisions of the tentative labor contract between the Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers union misstated the sources of the information. They were people close to the union and other sources, not company officials.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "A New Approach to Corporate Downsizing"
The Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers union reached a three-year agreement on Monday evening that provides the company with incentives to stop shrinking its work force and begin hiring more workers. The pact is subject to ratfication, considered virtually certain, by union members. Here are some of the provisions.
 
Ford's overall employment of U.A.W. members will stay at or above 95 percent of current levels. There are 105,000 U.A.W. workers in Ford now.
 
If Ford begins manufacturing auto parts that it previously purchased from outside suppliers, Ford can pay much lower wages to the extra workers hired.
 
Each low-wage worker hired in a new auto parts business counts as two-thirds of a worker for calculating compliance with the 95 percent minimum. So Ford has incentive to hire many low-wage workers so as to let more high-wage workers retire without replacing them.
 
Ford will raise pensions by an much as 11 percent over three years, partly as an incentive to encourage the retirement of high-wage workers.
 
Each Ford worker will receive a $2,000 bonus this year followed by a three percent bonus or wage increase in each of the second and third years. These are in addition to annual cost-of-living raises, which have been paid since 1948.

HEADLINE: WHEN MONEY COUNTS;
... And a New House Bends to a Family's Needs

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: MONTREAL

 BODY:
IF design awards were given for political correctness, "The Next Home," an experimental four-story house designed to be affordable for nontraditional families, could be a contender.
In this United States election year, as candidates again tout home ownership as part of the American dream, the $27-a-square-foot prototype home on view here at McGill University may represent the trenches of affordable design. 
 It also mirrors a broad swath of society. This new type of housing, built by McGill's Affordable Homes program, the first of its kind at a North American school of architecture, takes on the conventional wisdom of the homebuilding industry that bigger is better.
The "Next Home" offers a camera-ready vision of ourselves: adaptable at practically a moment's notice to non-Ozzie and Harriet family groups of every description: divorced parents, empty nesters, widowers working at home. Varied families need a variety of rooms, and the "Next Home" gives them the power to configure their own layouts and architectural details.
"The way we work, live and entertain is changing," said Prof. Avi Friedman, who designed the house.
"The landscape of the house needs to change along with it."
The prototype "Next Home," which is on display until Sept. 27, was built with a pollster's -- or a television sitcom writer's -- instinct for social and demographic trends, from the rise of the single-parent family to buying in bulk from shopping clubs.
Conceived as a triplex, the prototype has fictional occupants: Claude, 57, a widower who was downsized from his job; Marc and Julie, a young childless couple struggling to afford a starter home, and Susie, a single mother with two teen-age children.
In contrast to conventional housing, in which costly remodeling is often done after the fact, the "Next Home" lets residents create their own solutions -- say, buying as many floors as they want and personalizing them as their means allow. Homeowners, not builders or architects, decide whether to splurge on bay windows -- and where to put them -- and whether to go for a flat or a pitched roof.
Claude lives in the 750-square-foot ground-floor apartment, which includes a home office 15 feet by 12 feet, to accommodate the consulting firm he is starting: cost, about $40,000. It has its own wheelchair-accessible entrance (the layout easily lends itself also to a granny flat). Marc and Julie inhabit the second floor, an 800-square-foot space (about $40,000), which includes an unfinished porch that could eventually be turned into a baby's room. Susie, the divorced single mother, who supplements her income as a health-care worker by freelancing from home, bought the 1,150-square-foot two-story upper unit for about $53,000. She chose a two-tier loftlike space with a cathedral ceiling and dormer bedroom suite to give her and her children privacy.
The flexible design, in which "many things that today happen by accident will be planned for," in Professor Friedman's words, also allows homeowners or builders to alter the position of walls and stairways, which could easily allow a triplex, for example, to convert to a duplex. Rooms contain minimum walls, with the idea that homeowners can add them if they need them. (In the demonstration home, curtains and storage units function as room dividers, prompting some visitors to mutter that it was designed with the young in mind.)
Homeowners can also change the position of water pipes, heating and cooling ducts, drain pipes and electrical wiring without costly construction work, thanks to open-web joists, the structural members that make up ceilings and floors.
For better or worse, residents could also largely decree the look of the house. One novel concept of the "Next Home" is to let homeowners choose from a menu of architectural options. For an extra cost, for example, they could add a bay window, for extra seating in the living room or a pergola to the outdoor porch. The owner of the upper floors could turn the attic into a livable dormer mezzanine, which would determine if the building had a flat or gable roof.
The flexibility of the house symbolizes economic and social changes that have occurred over the last decade, including the unstable job market, in which, Professor Friedman said, "many people between the ages of 25 and 44 are not in a position to carry a mortgage over $100,000." The home is designed a la Gail Sheehy's "Passages," to parallel the changes in its occupants' lives.
To cut costs, Professor Friedman and his colleagues streamlined the construction, using prefabricated elements and relying on a simple no-frills floor plan requiring minimal mainenance. Its low cost and adaptability are attempts to translate into home design such issues as job insecurity (reflected in both the house costs and home offices); shrinking family size; working parents, and the growing numbers of empty-nesters, single parents and childless families. The goal, he said, is a house that "doesn't make assumptions on likely or projected household types" but "can evolve, like society."
Professor Friedman would like to do for housing what Steve Jobs did for computers, comparing the "Next Home" to a Honda versus a Cadillac. "We're offering the same cake, just smaller slices," he said.
Paradoxically, the idea of downsized houses, or smaller slices, flies in the face of United States homebuilding trends. Gopal Ahluwala, director of research for the National Association of Home Builders, says that though family size has decreased, the size of the average American house has increased to a whopping 2,100-square-feet, compared with 1,520 in 1971.
Mr. Ahluwala said that consumer studies indicate buyers want even more space, including two and a half baths or more. He attributed the escalating size to baby-boomer demand. "They want everything, whether they can afford it or not." He said that schemes like the "Next Home" were "a good idea, but not a national idea."
Professor Friedman argues that builders are designing outmoded gas guzzlers and that the lack of small units creates serious affordability problems. "Consumers respond to what's available," he said.
Gwendolyn Wright, a professor of architecture at Columbia University and author of "Building the Dream: A Social History of Housing in America," believes that "the market needs to be more flexible." She said: "Like a thermostat, it responds to climatic shifts, but it can also be adjusted. There needs to be more pluralism and experimentation."
Professor Friedman's commitment to affordable housing stems in part from experience. His parents are Holocaust survivors who immigrated to Israel from Poland in the 1940's. They lived in abandoned army barracks outside Tel Aviv before moving into a 350-square-foot home of cinder blocks. He and his sister shared the small bedroom while his parents slept on a pull-out bed in the living room. Professor Friedman vividly remembers the luxuriousness of 350 square feet. "Being able for the first time to have a shower indoors, the fortune of not hearing the rain zipping through the roof. It was wonderful to have that comfort."
In designing the "Next Home," he and his colleagues took cues from the postwar houses of the 1940's, including the 800-square-foot Levittown, L.I., houses. It was an era, Professor Friedman explained, in which small, modest homes were within reach of the average family, and government policies forced architects and builders to come up with innovative low-cost solutions.
For a year they interviewed occupants of postwar houses in and around Montreal, to learn if and how they modified their spaces. The conversations affirmed their hunches. "They showed us how versatile people could be at finding solutions internally," Professor Friedman said.
The form of the home was also inspired by the narrow-front Montreal duplexes and triplexes of the 1920's and 30's, which still punctuate the city's landscape with a latticework of external stairways.
The "Next Home" builds on the success of the "Grow Home," an affordable, 14-foot-wide single-family home Professor Friedman designed six years ago with the author Witold Rybczynski, now a professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
Much to Professor Friedman's continued amazement, the "Grow Home," which also began as a prototype plunked into the middle of the campus, took off commercially; there are more than 5,000 of them in and around Montreal.
The success of the "Grow Home" has spawned its own problems, chief among them quality control. There can be a big difference between a model home at a university and a developer's interpretation.
Garry Garbarino, a Montreal developer who built 350 "Grow Homes," said such housing needs good planning to succeed, including access to schools and shopping. Many of the "Grow Homes" have been built on urban fringes, far from city services, where land is cheap. He said the projects also need scrutiny from local planning boards. "Many builders took advantage of the 'Grow Home' and put out a shoddy product," he said.
"Affordable housing is a hot political issue in the United States," Professor Rybczynski pointed out, citing resistance of municipalities to anything that might lower property values. Ours, he added, is a "more contentious culture" than Canada's. Philadelphia and other American cities have a long tradition of small row houses, but the "Next Home" and "Grow Homes," he said,"would be more difficult to build here."
A recent visit to "Grow Homes" in Montreal found the owners generally happy with their houses, which though somewhat stark outside felt comfortable and roomy inside.
Andree Tardif, 49, a municipal employee who lives on her own in Laval, a Montreal suburb, added extras to her "Grow Home": an angled fireplace, suspended cupboards in the kitchen, a whirlpool bath to ease apres-ski aches. She would like to add a fireplace mantel, but "my wallet can't go as fast as I want to," she said.
Living in a "Grow Home" that cost her about $70,000, including the frills, has changed her idea of luxury, she said. "I used to want to live in a big house. Now I wonder, how do they manage to heat it? They feel so big. If you're two people, you're not close to each other."
They've plumbed the plusses. "It's a little house," Lise Languein, another "Grow" homeowner, said. "So it's no problem to cut the grass."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Narrow Range For Bonds On Rate Fears

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed but stayed in a narrow range yesterday, as the market continued to be weighed down by concerns of an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve.
Market participants remained wary that short-term rates may be increased at next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, particularly in light of a news article this past Tuesday that said some Fed district bank presidents had officially submitted requests for rate rises. 
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 5/32, to 96 25/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.01 percent, from 7.02 percent on Tuesday.
Among the data ignored yesterday was the July international trade report by the Commerce Department, which showed the trade gap widening, to $11.68 billion, the biggest gap since $12.9 million in the fourth quarter of 1987.
The National Association of Home Builders monthly index of single-family housing market conditions fell for the fourth consecutive month in early September to a reading of 56 from 57 in August. For some economists, this is a sign that the interest-rate-sensitive housing sector can slow without the Fed having to start raising rates. The index's peak this year was 63 in May.
Several Fed officials were scheduled to speak this week and market participants were actively interested in what they had to say. Some analysts noted that Fed officials usually refrained from saying anything about economic conditions and monetary policy in the week before a policy meeting.
Among the officials speaking yesterday was a Fed governor, Susan M. Phillips, who was in Washington appearing before the House Banking Committee. She spoke about the impact on the banking system of the Sumitomo copper trading scandal, and did not discuss the state of the economy or Fed monetary policy.
The Fed vice chairman, Alice Rivlin, speaking in New York at an Institute of International Bankers meeting, told reporters that the economy was healthy and that it had made progress toward growth with little inflation in the past few years.
Carroll J. Delaney, director of research at Stires, O'Donnell & Company, sees the market being treated to a battle royal between the opposing hawkish and dovish forces at the Fed, with the outcome still murky. Mr. Delaney says steady and impressive growth on the employment front has many experienced and supposedly savvy policy makers convinced that the time to act pre-emptively to nip inflation is now. On the other side, the argument goes, "Give growth a chance."
"Our own feeling," Mr. Delaney said, "is that the Fed chairman's influence in this conflict will be utilized to negotiate a compromise, resulting in a 25-basis-point hike in both the Fed Funds and discount rate next week." And there could be additional tightening should developments warrant, he added. "But, should housing starts drop off a cliff," Mr. Delaney added, "the doves may prevail at least until the next F.O.M.C. meeting."
Nationsbank, Ford Motor Credit Company and Daimler-Benz A.G. led a crush of companies wanting to borrow before the Fed meets next Tuesday. Nationsbank, sold $1.45 billion of debt in three parts with $500 million of senior notes due in 2001 priced to yield 7.034 percent, $500 million of subordinated notes due in 2006 priced to yield 7.500 percent and $450 million of subordinated notes due in 2016 priced to yield 7.862 percent.
The senior debt is rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by Standard & Poor's, while the subordinated debt is rated A-3 and A minus, respectively.
The Treasury yesterday also announced the size of its note auctions for next week. It plans to borrow $18.25 billion by selling two-year notes on Wednesday and $12.5 billion of five-year notes on Thursday, down about $500 million. In when-issued trading, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.25 percent and the five-year at a price to yield 6.61 percent.

HEADLINE: Photo Error Is Blamed For Defeat In Primary

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

 BODY:
All newspapers make mistakes at times, and apologize for them, but the correction and apology that The Star Tribune of Minneapolis put out after a computer glitch placed a picture of John Derus in the wrong article last week on the day of a primary election is not good enough for Gov. Arne Carlson of Minnesota. He thinks The Star Tribune should pay for a new election.
That is because Mr. Derus was a candidate in a State Senate primary that day, and the article with which his picture was accidentally printed, but with which he had nothing to do, was about charity fraud. "Charity Fraud," the headline said, right above Mr. Derus's photograph in the Sept. 10 issue, and when the ballots were counted, Mr. Derus had lost his race in the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party primary by 104 votes, out of more than 6,000 cast. 
 Since Mr. Derus would have won if just 53 of those 104 votes had gone to him, he and Governor Carlson say the election results were wrongly corrupted when enough headline-skimming readers got the impression from page B3 of The Star Tribune that morning that the candidate was some kind of crook.
Human error and a quirk of The Star Tribune's pagination process, which composes complete newspaper pages for the printing press, caused the mistake, said Tim J. McGuire, editor of The Star Tribune.
Mr. Derus wants a new election and the Governor agrees, adding that the newspaper, not the taxpayers, should pay the bill.
"It is my opinion that the Sept. 10 primary election should be declared null and void, and a new election should be held, and The Star Tribune should be accountable for election costs," Mr. Carlson wrote the Hennepin County Canvassing Board, the local election agency, on Monday.
Absolutely no, Mr. McGuire replied to the Governor's demand.
"We certainly take the mistake seriously," Mr. McGuire said. "It was the wrong picture in the wrong place on the wrong day, and we have apologized to Mr. Derus. But we have no intention of getting involved in the electoral process economically."
The fact that Mr. Carlson is a Republican and Mr. Derus is a Democrat does not appear to be enough of a difference to overcome what unites them: a shared dislike for Minnesota's biggest and most influential daily, with a weekday circulation of nearly 400,000.
The newspaper has frequently criticized Mr. Carlson in his six years as Governor, and a 1993 investigation by The Star Tribune reported that Mr. Carlson had ignored racketeering in the Minneapolis Employee Retirement Fund when he was State Auditor, an accusation the Governor denies.
Meanwhile, the words the newspaper has used to describe Mr. Derus, for 19 years a Hennepin County Commissioner and a former Minneapolis Alderman, are mostly of the blunt-object variety, like "bully."
Patrick H. O'Connor, the chairman of the canvassing board, wrote back to Governor Carlson on Monday that the case of the mixed-up photograph was not the board's problem.
"Any action sought by Mr. Derus regarding the actions of The Minneapolis Star Tribune must go through the courts," Mr. O'Connor said.
Mr. Derus has accordingly hired lawyers, who have until Friday, the day the canvassing board is to announce the winner, to challenge the outcome. But First Amendment experts said the idea of making a newspaper pay for anything as a result of a mistake did not pass legal muster.
Yet the Governor is sticking to his demands.
"The Governor certainly believes -- he is more convinced than I am -- that the election was affected by the mistake," said Cyndy Brucato, Mr. Carlson's deputy chief of staff.
Ms. Brucato estimated that a new primary election for the 58th District, which covers Minneapolis's north side, would cost about $2,000.
The newspaper had run the same picture of Mr. Derus in a voters guide on page B3 the week before the election ("a long history of cronyism, bullying and abuse of co-workers and subordinates," an editorial said of him that week), but technicians afterward neglected to remove the picture from the computer.
On the next Tuesday, the page-making machine placed Mr. Derus's picture back onto page B-3, this time in the charity fraud article.
Brian Rice, Mr. Derus's lawyer, conceded that state law generally required proof of fraud committed by one of the candidates, like a false claim of party endorsement, to void an election. But the law also cites the use of fraud by others to prevent the free exercise of the vote, Mr. Rice said, and the newspaper's past criticism of Mr. Derus may add to his case. But he stopped short of calling the photograph mix-up deliberate.
David Anderson, a professor of law at the Universityof Texas, said the Governor and the candidate had little chance of succeeding under current First Amendment doctrine of the Supreme Court.
"If the candidate sued for libel, he would lose because the United Supreme Court would say the newspaper is protected from liability for inadvertent error," he said. "For the very same reason that it is impermissible for the law to give a libel remedy, it is impermissible for the law to require a newspaper to pay for an election."

HEADLINE: Export Data Nudge Dow 11.47 Lower

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday for a second day as computer issues like Intel and Microsoft again reached record highs, helping offset weakness in machinery and retail shares.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 11.47 points, to 5,877.36, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 1.47, to 681.47. The Nasdaq composite index, home to both Intel and Microsoft, climbed 2.40, to 1,205.71. 
 Declining stocks outnumbered advancing issues by about 7 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange, where 396.6 million shares changed hands, below the average for the last three days.
Stocks suffered after a report of unexpectedly weak United States exports in July damaged machinery companies and other companies that have large sales abroad.
The trade report also suggested that economic growth might not be as robust as expected in the third quarter. Total United States exports fell 3.6 percent in July, to $67.2 billion, prompting some leading economists to consider lowering their third-quarter growth forecasts for the entire economy.
As a result, among the biggest percentage decliners in the S.& P. 500 were the farm and construction-equipment makers Deere, down 1 1/8, to 41 7/8, and Case, off 1, to 47 5/8. Cincinnati Milacron, a maker of machine tools, fell 5/8, to 21 1/4.
Gillette, which got 70 percent of its sales last year overseas. fell 5/8, to 67 5/8. Gillette, the razor maker, recently agreed to buy Duracell International, which gets half its sales abroad. Duracell slipped 7/8, to 59 3/4.
"I don't think the foreign markets, especially the European markets, are recovering the way people thought," said Gil Knight, director of research at Allied Investment Advisors, who helps oversee $4 billion in assets. "There doesn't seem to be any great economic advance in Europe, so who's going to have the money to buy?"
Concern about the pace of economic growth in the United States and questions about the strength of Christmas sales hurt retail stocks. Sears, Roebuck fell 1/2, to 44 7/8; Wal-Mart Stores slipped 1/2, to 26 5/8, and Dayton Hudson declined 1, to 34 1/4.
The advance in computer-related shares showed that some investors believed these companies would do well even in the sixth year of the economic expansion, Graham Tanaka, president of Tanaka Capital Management, said. "There are some very healthy parts of the technology sector, and the companies that have proprietary positions are going to do very well," he added.
Microsoft rose 2 5/8, to 136 1/2. And Intel soared 1 3/8, to a record 95 5/8. Earlier this week, the chip maker said sales had been unexpectedly strong in the current quarter.
The feeling among many investors was that because of their dominance of the computer market, Intel and Microsoft were more likely to benefit from improved personal computer sales than any of their rivals.
Not all computer-related issues did well. Netscape Communications slumped 3 3/8, to 42 5/8, in trading of more than 3.8 million shares after Merrill Lynch cut its investment opinion to "neutral." Merrill said the Internet pioneer's window of opportunity against Microsoft, the country's leading software publisher, was shrinking fast.
Zenith Electronics climbed 2, to 16 5/8. Its chairman denied speculation that the company, a maker of consumer electronics, was in talks to be sold.
Trading in options to buy Zenith's shares soared as well. Options to buy stock at 15 a share in October vaulted 1 3/8, or 110 percent, to 2 5/8, as 1,618 contracts changed hands.
 Trans World Airlines retreated 1/8, to 10 1/2. The airline said cancellations in the wake of the explosion of T.W.A. Flight 800 in July and higher fuel costs would reduce profits below the levels of a year earlier.

HEADLINE: World Bank Focusing on Areas Shunned by Western Business

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 18

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund is likely to sell some of its gold reserves to finance two new initiatives to help the world's poorest countries, high-ranking officials of the agency said tonight.
After a daylong meeting of its executive board, the I.M.F. managing director, Michel Camdessus, issued a brief statement saying that agreement had been reached to finance a joint debt-relief plan with the World Bank as well as on the financing of a special credit service for the world's poorest countries, to be known as the enhanced structural adjustment facility. 
 The I.M.F.'s share of the two programs was expected to total $3.6 billion, and representatives from several nations have argued how to pay the bill. Germany, backed by Italy and Switzerland, wanted I.M.F. members to pay for the programs from their national budgets. They were opposed by the United States, Canada and Britain, who considered it unlikely that governments would come up with the money and argued instead for the sale of gold.
Negotiators ultimately agreed that a gold sale worth approximately $2 billion was the only way to pay for the programs, the I.M.F. officials said. The size of the sale will depend on how much members contribute to the programs.
It was not clear tonight if the matter of the gold sale actually came to a vote of the I.M.F. governing board, but the board rarely votes yes or no on issues, preferring instead to seek a consensus. The deal is to be presented for final approval at the annual meetings of the World Bank and the I.M.F. at the end of the month, when finance ministers of the fund's member nations gather here.
The monetary fund's total gold reserves are worth about $40 billion, and Mr. Camdessus has proposed selling approximately five million ounces, worth approximately $2 billion, the I.M.F. officials said.
The countries that opposed the sale had argued that the international agency would be undermining its own financial credibility if it started selling its gold at a time when it had large loan payments due from Mexico and Russia.
The World Bank has estimated that the debt-relief plan -- which would assist about 20 deeply indebted poor countries such as Uganda and Mozambique -- will cost the two international agencies somewhere between $5.6 billion and $7.7 billion over several years.
Separately, the World Bank announced a plan to attract private investment to developing countries that Western businesses have largely shunned.
The agency's International Finance Corporation said it had selected 16 countries and regions either very poor or troubled by a collectivist past as the focus of its efforts. It said it would send investment officers there to generate business opportunities for local and foreign entrepreneurs. The areas include Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia, Kazakstan, Uzbekistan, Mongolia, El Salvador and the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
At the same time, Jannik Lindbaek, the International Finance Corporation's executive vice president, said the agency had approved a record $3.2 billion in financing for 264 private investment projects in the developing world last year, a rise of 12 percent from 1994 and the fifth consecutive double-digit increase. Private industry invested $16.4 billion in the same projects, he added. "There is a continuing trend in favor of the private sector in the developing world," Mr. Lindbaek said.
The decision to set up shop in distressed countries, as well as the overall increase in activities in the third world, are part of the development strategy that the World Bank's president, James D. Wolfensohn, has been pushing since he took over the United Nations agency in June 1995. Under his leadership, the World Bank has tried to compensate for declines in foreign aid from richer countries by stimulating private-sector investment in the poor nations and spreading it around more evenly.
As part of that drive, the agency plans to offer foreign companies more generous guarantees against the political risks of investing, like unanticipated price controls or expropriations of property. It is also working with the International Monetary Fund on a plan for reducing the debts of the most indebted poor countries.
While official aid has stagnated at $55 billion to $65 billion annually in recent years, such private investment has nearly quadrupled to $167 billion last year, from $44 billion in 1990. But three-fourths of the money went to just 12 developing countries.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE SENATE;
Democrats Fight Hard In Key Midwest Races

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, Sept. 18

 BODY:
In their first two debates here this week, Senator Paul Wellstone repeatedly called his Republican opponent, former Senator Rudy Boschwitz, a "cheerleader for the Gingrich agenda."
Just as often, Mr. Boschwitz called Mr. Wellstone "ultra-liberal" or "embarrassingly liberal." 
 Once you discount as election-year hyperbole words like "cheerleader" and "embarrassingly," the candidates' characterizations of each other were close to the mark.
Mr. Boschwitz, who served two terms in the Senate before Mr. Wellstone ousted him in 1990, does in fact favor, without significant exception, he says, the social and economic policies advocated by Speaker Newt Gingrich. Mr. Boschwitz would substantially shrink the size of the Government, relax regulations meant to protect the environment and outlaw abortions in most circumstances.
Mr. Wellstone, without apologies, is possibly the most liberal Democrat in the Senate. He was the only Senator running for re-election who voted against the Republican welfare bill that President Clinton signed this month.
Mr. Wellstone advocates Government-run universal health insurance. He voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was strongly backed by Mr. Clinton and most other Senators from both parties, on the ground that the accord did not go far enough to prevent child labor and environmental abuses by companies in Mexico.
This campaign, perhaps more than any other contest in the country this fall, is likely to turn on issues and ideology, not on personalities or tactics or money.
As matters now stand, the rematch is extremely close. The most recent poll, released last week by The Minneapolis Star Tribune and WCCO-TV, showed Mr. Wellstone with 43 percent and Mr. Boschwitz with 42 percent, along with 2 percent for a third-party candidate and the rest undecided. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points.
The Minnesota race is one of eight Senate races in the Middle West this year. Several of them could go either way, and their outcome could be a decisive factor determining whether Democrats pick up enough seats to regain control of the Senate. With Republicans now holding a 53-to-47 advantage, Democrats need to pick up 3 seats assuming President Clinton is re-elected and Vice President Al Gore has the tie-breaking vote.
In addition to Senator Wellstone, two other incumbent Senators in this region are in tight races.
In South Dakota, Senator Larry Pressler, a Republican seeking a third term, seems to be no better than an even bet to defeat Representative Tim Johnson, a Democrat, who has been elected statewide because the state has only one Congressional seat.
In Iowa, Senator Tom Harkin, a Democrat, seems to be ahead of his Republican challenger, Representative Jim Ross Lightfoot, but the race may now be close enough that Mr. Lightfoot could pull off an upset. National Republican organizations plan to pour money into Iowa to help Mr. Lightfoot in the last few weeks of the campaign. But Mr. Harkin is still expected to spend double and possibly triple what Mr. Lightfoot does, and that could make the difference.
The other incumbent Senator running this fall in the Midwest is Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat. Mr. Levin seems to have pulled away from his Republican challenger, Ronna Romney, a conservative radio talk-show host. She is divorced from Scott Romney, son of former Gov. George Romney.
Of the four open Senate seats in the region, two are now held by Democrats, two by Republicans.
Democrats are expected to hold their two seats. In Nebraska, where Senator Jim Exon is retiring, Gov. Ben Nelson has a commanding lead over the Republican candidate, Chuck Hagel, a business executive.
In Illinois, Representative Richard J. Durbin was helped when the most conservative candidate in the Republican primary, State Representative Al Salvi, won his party's nomination. Mr. Durbin, a Democrat, now seems to be comfortably ahead in the race to succeed Senator Paul Simon, who is retiring.
The two open Republican seats are in Kansas. Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum is retiring after three terms. Senator Bob Dole vacated the other seat when he quit the Senate in June to concentrate on his race for President.
If the Democrats can win either one, they will be bucking history. Kansas has not had a Democratic Senator since 1939.
In the race for the Kassebaum seat, Sally Thompson, the Democratic State Treasurer, is given little chance of beating Representative Pat Roberts, the prominent Republican chairman of the House Agriculture Committee.
But the race for the Dole seat is tight. In the Republican primary, Representative Sam Brownback broke with his party leaders and challenged and defeated Senator Sheila Frahm, the former Lieutenant Governor who was appointed to the Senate after Mr. Dole resigned. The Democratic candidate is Jill Docking, a stockbroker.
Mr. Brownback has been one of the most prominent of the conservative freshmen in the Republican Congress. Mrs. Docking handily defeated a former Governor, Joan Finney, in the Democratic primary last month. Mrs. Docking has never held public office, but her name is well known in Kansas. Her husband, Tom Docking, was Lieutenant Governor in the 1980's, and his father and grandfather were Governors.
Of all the interesting races in the Midwest, the one in Minnesota is the most compelling, not just because of the stark ideological differences between Mr. Wellstone and Mr. Boschwitz but also because bad blood between the two camps seems to have spilled over from the 1990 race.
Mr. Wellstone, a college professor who had never run for office before and who started out hardly known around the state, upset Mr. Boschwitz six years ago, 50 percent to 48 percent. A minor party candidate won 2 percent.
This year, they are going at each other like two gladiators.
Before their two debates on Monday -- one before the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, the other in a radio studio -- there was none of the bantering and hand-shaking candidates usually engage in. From the outset, both were on the attack.
Mr. Boschwitz, who is 65, called Mr. Wellstone, 52, "the biggest spender in the entire Senate." Mr. Boschwitz accused Senator Wellstone of wanting to continue a failed welfare system and "give away the store" to big government.
Mr. Wellstone asserted that Mr. Boschwitz favored cutting education, letting corporate polluters write the environmental laws and "balancing the budget on the backs of our parents and grandparents."
In an interview in his office, Mr. Boschwitz said he made a mistake in 1990 by underestimating Mr. Wellstone. "We didn't take him seriously enough," he said. "We didn't organize soon enough. We weren't ready."
He did not make the same mistake this time. Early on, the National Republican Senatorial Committee identified Mr. Wellstone as the most vulnerable Democratic Senator. For more than a year, it has been running television advertisements here attacking his liberal record.
Mr. Wellstone has conserved his resources and focused on building a state-wide field organization that is much stronger than Mr. Boschwitz's. But like Mr. Boschwitz, he plans to spend millions of dollars on commercials in the fall campaign.
In the end, said Steven S. Smith, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota, "the question will be whether Wellstone is too liberal even for Minnesota."
Mr. Boschwitz maintains that Mr. Wellstone's vote against the welfare bill proves that the Senator is indeed too liberal.
Mr. Wellstone said he had no choice. "If I had voted any other way," he said, "I would not have been proud."

HEADLINE: Deficit Soared In U.S. Trade During July

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 18

 BODY:
The trade deficit surged in July to its highest level in at least four and a half years, the Government said today, undermining the Clinton Administration's claim to an improving trade performance but reducing the chances of inflation infecting the economy.
The Commerce Department said the deficit rose 42.7 percent, to $11.7 billion, from $8.2 billion in June, far higher than economists had expected and the highest level since the Government began its current monthly measurement system in January 1992. Under a previous system, which measured the deficit quarterly rather than monthly, the deficit last exceeded its current level in the last three months of 1987, when the figure averaged $12.9 billion a month. 
 Today's report reflected a 3.6 percent drop in exports, to $67.2 billion, and a 1.2 percent increase in imports, to $78.9 billion. The deficit has bounced up and down all year, and for the first seven months of the year is running about 10 percent lower than it was during the period last year.
Economists said the drop in exports during July suggested that the economy, which grew at a breakneck pace of 4.8 percent in the second quarter, had begun to slow to a more sustainable rate in the current quarter. Although a reduction in exports could put a crimp on job creation and corporate profits, it could also help head off any of the inflationary pressures that tend to build in the economy when it is running flat out.
Analysts said some details of the report were puzzling, and that it was too soon to say whether the July deficit was a harbinger of further deterioration in the nation's trade position. In particular, they said, there was no evident reason for the deficit with Western Europe to have grown to $4.2 billion in July from $800 million in June.
But there were enough troubling elements to the figures, including a 34 percent increase in the deficit with Japan, to provide Bob Dole's Presidential campaign with an opportunity to criticize President Clinton's economic record.
"We had better change captains, because the ship is sinking," said Robert Lighthizer, a Washington lawyer who is Mr. Dole's trade adviser.
Mr. Lighthizer said the figures were "flabbergasting" and were the latest evidence of why the nation was suffering from a loss of manufacturing jobs, stagnant wages and a squeeze on middle-class living standards. Mr. Dole is working on a major trade speech, to be delivered sometime in the next month, in which he is expected to criticize Mr. Clinton as all talk and no results on trade policy.
The Clinton Administration, which has regularly credited its own trade policies for previous reductions in the deficit, argued today that the July increase was actually a result of the nation's economic strength. Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor said American demand for goods and services was outpacing that of other nations because the United States was enjoying higher growth rates than most of its biggest trading partners.
"The U.S. trade picture reflects the underlying strength of the U.S. economy," Mr. Kantor told a news conference. "We are in the middle of a period of solid, balanced growth."
With economists looking for any sign of the Federal Reserve's intentions as it prepares for next week's key meeting on whether to increase interest rates, today's figures provided a dollop of evidence that the economy might be slowing.
David Orr, the chief capital markets economist for the First Union Corporation, said he had reduced his estimate of third-quarter growth to 2 percent from 2.3 percent because of the trade figures.
With the Federal Reserve likely to have a spirited debate over whether to raise interest rates when it meets next week, projections of lower growth and an attendant easing of inflationary pressures "would help those on the side of not hiking rates," Mr. Orr said.
Mr. Orr said that taken at face value today's report showed that the biggest problem for American trade was in Europe, which is not rebounding from an economic downturn as quickly as predicted and therefore is not importing as many American goods and services as expected.
But Mr. Orr said there were enough statistical anomalies in the report to make him reluctant to draw any broad conclusions about the direction of the nation's trade performance.
"We should wait until next month to make a judgment," he said.
Other economists agreed that the drop in exports was larger than other economic reports or the gradual strengthening of the dollar had suggested. Nonetheless, the report showed that the deficit in goods trade was $15.6 billion, the second highest in history behind the $15.9 billion recorded in December 1985.
The figures showed a 10 percent jump in crude oil imports, with the increase driven by a combination of higher prices and growing volume. On the export side, sales of civilian aircraft to other nations dropped 43 percent, to $238 million.
Among the most politically sensitive increases was a jump in imports of Japanese automobiles and parts, which increased 11 percent in July, to $2.9 billion. Exports of American autos and parts to Japan fell 4.5 percent in July, to $341 million. The Clinton Administration has long hailed its trade agreements with Japan as redressing an imbalance in the auto trade, and negotiators from the two nations opened a two-day meeting in San Francisco today to review their 1995 auto-trade agreement.
China's deficit with the United States also increased, to $3.8 billion, from $3.3 billion in June, when China briefly surpassed Japan as the nation with the biggest trade gap with the United States. The deficit with Taiwan also increased, to $1.2 billion, from $1 billion in June.
Among the nation's other big trading partners, the deficit with Canada narrowed to $2.1 billion, from $2.6 billion in June, and the deficit with Mexico declined to $1.4 billion from $1.5 billion.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Low Inventories Of Heating Oil Signal Higher Prices Ahead

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Consumers in the Northeast could see heating-oil prices soar further -- especially if there is an unusually cold winter -- because inventories are extremely low.
Indeed, futures prices of heating oil are already higher than they were during the blizzards of last winter. 
 Until now, refineries have been concentrating much of their production on diesel fuel because of continuing strong demand.
Some analysts believe refiners are reaching a point at which they will be unable to replenish heating-oil inventories in time for cold weather, making a spike in heating-oil prices almost inevitable.
"It's going to be very difficult to build inventories on the East Coast to levels that would be adequate to accommodate an early cold spell in November or even early January," said Phillip K. Verleger Jr., an analyst for Charles River Associates Inc. "We're going into this with lower heating oil stocks than we've ever gone before."
The American Petroleum Institute, the industry trade group, reported this week that inventories of heating oil and other distillate fuels rose by just 235,000 barrels, to 112.1 million barrels, last week. Analysts had expected stockpiles to increase by one million to three million barrels.
As a result, already slim inventories are even slimmer. Heating-oil stocks are now about 21.5 million barrels below their levels in the corresponding period last year.
Prices for heating oil have climbed throughout the summer, an unusual occurrence that far from winter. Yesterday, heating oil for October delivery jumped 2.28 cents, to 67.876 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
On Friday, the near-term futures price traded as high as 70.15 cents a gallon -- the highest since November 1991 -- because of concerns that supplies will remain very tight. In contrast, the highest price reached during the winter for the near-term futures contract for heating oil was 64.90 cents a gallon on Feb. 27.
Crude oil prices have also been rising. Yesterday, October crude gained 58 cents, to $23.89 a barrel.
Mr. Verleger said that if the weather remained warm inventories could still be built up enough to avoid big price rises. But he called that chance slim.
Ed Rothschild, the energy policy director of Citizen Action, an advocacy group, said that the tight supply of heating oil was similar to the situation in the spring when low inventories of gasoline and strong demand sent gas prices soaring.
"The refiners have been keeping low inventories to reduce their costs," he said. "They have passed the risk onto the consuming public.
"We've gotten to the point where the consumer will bear the higher cost of the companies holding low inventories."
He said that while there might not be collusion by oil refiners to keep stocks low, the fact that most major refiners had resorted to the same strategy was having a similar effect.
He said that the retail price of heating oil could jump 10 cents to 20 cents a gallon in the next several weeks and move even higher.
Some analysts also said that inventories were also lean in Europe and that soaring prices for gasoil, the equivalent for heating oil there, could also hurt imports.
The last time prices for heating oil soared in the Northeast, which uses the largest amounts, was in 1989 as a result of a severely cold winter.
Some analysts are concerned that the low inventories would provide very little cushion if an accident closed a big refinery.
There have been calls by some members of Congress from the Northeast for the Secretary of Energy to use supplies in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help keep heating-oil prices down. Earlier this year, President Clinton ordered a sale of some of the reserve's oil in a bid to lower surging gasoline prices.
Higher prices for distillates like heating oil will put refiners in a strong position to recover from rising prices for crude oil. The price for crude has risen as a result of the tensions between the United States and Iraq and the fact that Iraq will be unable to sell oil in the world market in the near term.

HEADLINE: Regulators Turn Spotlight on Cybermoney

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
As concerns grow about electronic money laundering, cybercounterfeiting and bank runs on the Internet, regulators in the United States and around the world are scurrying to catch up with the rapid development of electronic money.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin plans to announce today two initiatives intended to grapple with the new technology. United States regulators will look at consumer protection issues raised by new technologies, like smart cards that store electronic money for making small purchases. In another move, an international group of regulators, under the auspices of the Group of Seven industrialized countries, will examine the international cooperation needed as money moves through the borderless world of the Internet. 
 "We are concerned about the use of electronic transfer of value for cross-border money laundering or cross-border tax evasion," Mr. Rubin said in an interview yesterday. In addition, he said countries would have to sort out which laws apply to electronic transactions.
"If someone in Washington buys something over the Internet from someone in London, where on the wire under the Atlantic did the transaction take place?" Mr. Rubin asked.
The creation of two committees of regulators demonstrates that government recognizes that action will eventually be needed on electronic transactions. Still, given the complex international issues involved, it will takes years to reach a consensus. And some experts say that there is little that regulators can now do.
"It is so questionable now what form all this will take, that the Government couldn't regulate it if it tried," said Anita Boomstein, a lawyer who specializes in consumer payment issues at Hughes Hubbard & Reed in New York. "So the Government will take a hands-off attitude until it gets so big it is an entire system of money and the Federal Reserve will need to be in control."
Mr. Rubin will announce the regulators' panels in a speech beginning a two-day conference in Washington today. The conference, sponsored by the Treasury Department, will bring together senior officials ranging from Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, to John S. Reed, chairman of Citicorp.
"The electronic transfer of value will be enormously important with respect to how economies function in the years and decades ahead," Mr. Rubin said. "Since we deal with money, finance and banking, our goal was to get ahead of the curve."
There have been a handful of tests of various forms of electronic money. Smart cards, with money stored on them, were introduced by three big banks at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, and a similar system is set for testing early next year on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
A small but growing number of purchases are being made over the Internet, mainly by using credit cards. But Mark Twain Bank of St. Louis has introduced an electronic cash product, developed by Digicash of the Netherlands, in which money is actually stored on the disk drives of users' computers.
These early moves have already forced some regulators to confront how the new technology fits into existing regulations. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has decided that money stored on smart cards does not count as federally insured deposits. That means if the card is lost, there is no guaranteed refund. (Some companies, like American Express, are developing stored-value cards that do offer refunds if lost, as with traveler's checks.)
Moreover, there is now no requirement that a company that issues stored-value cards must be a bank or regulated in any other way. That raises the question of whether these cards will become as unruly as the market for prepaid telephone cards, in which a number of card vendors have failed to deliver the calls that were promised.
"The prepaid phone card market is a good example of how consumers can be left holding the bag," said Sharon P. Sivertsen, director of the office of policy development for the F.D.I.C.
To prevent such problems, a number of other countries have decided to require that stored-value cards only be issued by banks.
The Federal Reserve has issued proposals on whether the consumer protections guaranteed for other electronic money transfers -- like direct deposits and debit cards -- will apply to stored-value card purchases. These protections include the requirement of receipts with every purchase and a limit on liability if a card is lost or stolen.
The Fed has proposed that card systems that cannot hold more than $100 and those that have no central records of how much money is on each card be exempt from the strict consumer protection rules.
"The Fed proposal is destroying consumer protection," said Janice C. Shields, the consumer research director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group in Washington. "They don't want to disclose error resolution procedures, and they want unlimited consumer losses."
Ms. Shields has proposed that issuers be required to list information about what to do in case of problems and disclosures about fees and liability of losses on the back of each card and at locations that sell or accept the card.
The $100 limit may have a particular cost for consumers, she added. "It's a fee bonanza for the banksbecause you will have to load the card more often an pay a fee every time," she said.
The Smart Card Forum, an industry group, by contrast, says the Fed exemptions do not go far enough and the stored-value products are so new that they should not be regulated.
The new technology raises a range of other issues that regulators expect to confront the next few years. The effectiveness of computer security measures, for example, has the Government of two minds. On one hand, regulators concerned with consumer protection and with the safety and soundness of banks want to insure that security is as strict as possible. Yet law enforcement agencies are frightened by the anonymity such systems grant potential criminals.
It is unclear, how fast these electronic money systems will move into mainstream use. Banking by computer, for example, languished for nearly a decade until the last year, when nearly a million people signed up for a new batch of services.
One force pushing the development of the technology, however, is the Government itself, which has mandated that all payments to or from Government accounts must be made electronically by 1999. This may have the most significant effect on the recipients of various welfare programs, many whom now do not have bank accounts that could receive an electronic money transfer. To deal with this, various groups of state governments are developing special cards on which benefits payments will be stored. Recipients will be able to use the cards to withdraw cash at automated teller machines and to make purchases.
One of the thorniest issues is whether holders of these welfare cards get the same protections as holders of credit and debit cards issued by banks. State and local governments do not want to absorb the cost of issuing refunds, for example, though some readings of the electronic funds transfer act would require that they do.
Some are also concerned that as banks move more toward offering their services electronically, they will have more reason to close branches in inner-city areas.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Japan Inc., so resilient in the past, can't find its footing.

BYLINE: Peter Passell 

 BODY:
REMEMBER Japan Inc., the unstoppable juggernaut? The juggernaut stalled in the early 1990's with the near-collapse of the Japanese real estate and stock markets. Now it appears that the Government's sputtering effort to rekindle growth is once more failing: after a big first quarter, the economy actually shrank at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the second quarter.
Standard antirecessionary tools are not working in the face of falling prices. And the Government seems trapped by politics and myopia into staying the course, which -- perversely -- includes a big rise in the national sales tax next April. "Japan's macroeconomic policy is the worst anywhere since the Great Depression," said John Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. 
 Not surprisingly, economic growth in Japan has slowed over the last two decades as it narrowed the productivity gap with America and Europe. What is surprising is that an economy that responded so resiliently to the oil shocks of the 1970's has been unable to shrug off its current problems.
In part, that may be because the problems are serious. When speculative bubbles in real estate and stocks burst, the shuffling of wealth traumatized a financial system ill suited to rapid change. "While the Government won't let them go under, everybody knows the big Japanese banks are virtually insolvent," said Gary Saxonhouse, an economist at the University of Michigan.
In part, it is because exporters did not ride to the rescue. In earlier recessions, a weakening exchange rate made Japanese goods irresistible in world markets. This time around, though, the yen actually strengthened -- a circumstance Ronald McKinnon, an economist at Stanford University, attributes to pressure from Washington to contain the Japanese trade surplus.
But in part, too, failure has begot failure in ways eerily reminiscent of the Depression. The Bank of Japan has cut interest rates as far as they can be cut: bank depositors now earn just a quarter of 1 percent on their money. But falling prices that breed expectations of further falls have made business reluctant to borrow, even at very low rates, because loans must be repaid in yen that will be worth more. Putting it another way, deflation has left Japan with a real interest rate considerably higher than the nominal rate.
By the same token, fiscal stimulus has been far less effective than most economists predicted. Big spending on public works -- Japan is running out of roads to repave -- has apparently has created little "multiplier effect" because much of the income is going into bank accounts rather than private demand. Consumers are reluctant to spend when, as Mr. Makin puts it, "the toaster you buy next year will be cheaper than the one you buy this year."
Adding to this misery, there is considerable opposition to further fiscal stimulus because it would increase the (already substantial) budget deficit. Just as Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to balance the Federal budget in 1937 and set off a slide back into depression, this Japanese Government seems determined to raise taxes on consumer spending next year in order to curb its deficit.
That leaves Japan's old standby, export-led growth, which ought to be possible if all those good cars and computers could be sold abroad at competitive prices. "There's nothing wrong here that an exchange rate of 130 yen to the dollar couldn't fix," Mr. Saxonhouse said. (The current rate is 110.)
It is hard to imagine, though, that the Clinton Administration would cooperate with coordinated actions that reduce the exchange value of the yen and make American products less competitive. While the White House did stop its drum roll of protectionist threats in 1994 after the Japanese economy's problems became too severe to ignore, Detroit's fate still matters a lot more to President Clinton than Toyota City's.
Mr. Saxonhouse holds out hope of a slow fix. The yen-dollar exchange rate, he notes, has already depreciated by one-third since its high point a year ago, and the full effect has yet to be felt on exports. Higher interest rates in America -- rates not matched by the Bank of Japan -- should further weaken the yen. Most important, Mr. Saxonhouse suggests, when push comes to shove, Japan has a history of accommodating reality. "I don't see Tokyo stepping knowingly into another recession" by raising taxes, he says.
Still, it is not clear the economy has reached a point where the Ministry of Finance, Japan's coterie of conservative bureaucrats who make policy as if the nation were perpetually on the brink of hyperinflation, will lose its grip. Bankruptcies remain uncommon, the banks are limping along and there is no army of homeless sleeping on the grounds of the Emperor's palace. If Germany can live with 10 percent unemployment, perhaps Japan will grow accustomed to 4 percent.

HEADLINE: Shifting Gears, Beijing Reins In Anti-Japanese Campaign

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 18

 BODY:
After months of whipping up nationalist sentiment against Japan, Britain and the United States, China's Communist Party leadership suddenly seems to have realized that nationalism could spin out of control.
Over the last several days, the Ministries of Public Security and State Security mobilized thousands of uniformed and plainclothes policemen in major cities to prevent demonstrations on the anniversary of Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931. A number of anti-Japanese dissidents who have in the past campaigned to reopen the issue of Japan's war reparations were dispatched by the police to out-of-town guest houses and others put under close watch at home. 
 Students from Beijing University and other major academic centers around the country were placed under tight control after some student organizers put up posters last week calling for demonstrations, only to have them ripped down by security men.
University authorities "urged the faculty to persuade the students to avoid situations that might harm stability," one faculty member said today, and additional security details were deployed on campus to monitor bulletin boards and open meetings.
The Japanese Embassy in Beijing's diplomatic quarter resembled an armed camp today, with more than 100 additional policemen deployed in front of and on the approaches to the compound two miles east of Tiananmen Square, where security was also tightened.
The leadership fears, in the view of a number of Chinese, that once any demonstration begins it could lurch unpredictably, and even turn against the Government as did the 1989 demonstrations at Tiananmen Square. What started then as a stirring memorial to the former Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang became a major pro-democracy uprising that paralyzed the capital for six weeks and, ultimately, was suppressed with a military assault by tanks.
"The Government is afraid that if they let the students demonstrate against the Japanese, there might be two unemployed workers among the 10,000 demonstrators who would shout 'Food!' and 'We have to live!' and then the demonstration could be totally transformed," said a Chinese intellectual who asked that his name not be used.
The mobilization followed a summer of bare-knuckled editorials in Communist Party newspapers assailing Japanese leaders for paying homage to Japan's militaristic past and, most recently, for allowing right-wing groups to raise the Japanese flag over a tiny group of disputed islands that Japan calls the Senkakus and China calls Diaoyu.
Coming on the heels of clashes with Britain over the transfer of Hong Kong to Beijing's control, and with the United States over its support of Taiwan, the Chinese Government's verbal assault on Japan has incited strong patriotic feelings here in the Chinese capital, where spontaneous open-air lectures attracted several hundred students last week.
As the Communist Party continues to seek a new basis for legitimacy in a post-Communist Chinese society, the official promotion of nationalistic themes, historic grievances and patriotic displays has relieved the party of its role as the most frequent target for the disaffection of millions of Chinese who are losing their jobs at bankrupt state industries, or who are struggling against poverty in interior provinces where prosperity has been slow to penetrate.
But in the end, the Government may only be postponing the day of reckoning.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE ISSUES;
G.O.P. Tries Hard to Win Black Votes, but Recent History Works Against It

BYLINE: By R.W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 18

 BODY:
In a number of ways, the Republican Party has sought to make this the year it would break the Democratic hammerlock on the votes of black Americans.
Starting with the windfall of Gen. Colin L. Powell's announcement of Republican affiliation, and continuing with Bob Dole's choice of Jack Kemp as his running mate, party officials allowed themselves to hope that their Presidential ticket might pull 15 percent or 16 percent of the black vote this year, up from 11 percent for George Bush in 1992. In the euphoria of the San Diego convention, one top campaign official set the target at 20 percent. 
 But there is no sign the Republicans are actually gaining; in the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, in fact, they are doing worse than in 1992. Only 3 percent of the black respondents in the survey, completed early this month, said they intended to vote for the Dole-Kemp ticket, and only 7 percent said they would vote for the Republican House candidate in their district.
It was not always thus. From the Civil War until the 1930's, the party of Lincoln was the party of black America. The Democrats permitted no blacks to attend conventions in any official capacity until 1924, and even the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 did little at first to change things. Ralph Bunche, later a noted peacemaker but then a young black political scientist, complained that "the New Deal only serves to crystallize those abuses and oppressions which the exploited Negro citizenry of America have long suffered under laissez-faire capitalism."
But in 1936, there were 10 black delegates and 22 alternates at the Democrats' convention in Philadelphia, despite Southern protests, and Roosevelt, with union support, captured 71 percent of the black vote.
Still, in that Presidential election and the six following ones, Republican nominees took 25 percent to 40 percent of the black vote. Black delegations from Southern states survived well into the Eisenhower era.
The big change came in 1964 with Barry Goldwater and "states' rights," a phrase and philosophy widely seen as anti-black and opposed by President Lyndon B. Johnson, the godfather of voting rights for blacks. In that Presidential election and the seven after, no Republican gained more than 15 percent of the black vote. Mr. Bush took only 10 percent in 1988, when he built his campaign in part around his opponent's freeing a black convict who then raped a white woman. In 1992, he added but one percentage point.
So why is Mr. Dole, for all his and Mr. Kemp's efforts, doing worse?
Part of the reason is the weakness of the Dole-Kemp campaign. Part, no doubt, is President Clinton's easy relation with blacks, not only on a partisan level but also in purely cultural terms. His Arkansas roots show when he visits a black church, and his popularity among blacks has clearly not been hurt by his signing of the Republicans' welfare bill.
But most important is the Republican Party's recent record as the vehicle of white supremacy in the South, beginning with the Goldwater campaign and reaching its apex in Richard M. Nixon's "Southern strategy" in 1968 and 1972. Republicans appealed to Nixon Democrats (later Reagan Democrats) in the Northern suburbs, many of them ethnic voters who had left the cities to escape from blacks, with promises to crack down on welfare cheats and to bring law and order; the party also fought affirmative action.
That legacy, said Eddie N. Williams of the Joint Center for Political Studies, a nonpartisan research group focusing on black issues, remains a formidable burden for Republicans. Even if General Powell had been on the ticket this year, Mr. Williams said, Republicans would probably not have won a majority of black votes.
"All Republicans -- Kemp less than most, Powell even less -- carry some heavy negative baggage," Mr. Williams said. "Something more fundamental than the Presidential nominee has to change. Their program has to change; their approach has to change."
That flies in the face of the tactics enunciated by Haley Barbour, chairman of the Republican National Committee. Citing polls that show one-third of blacks or more defining themselves as conservatives, Mr. Barbour argues that it would be a mistake to "water down" his party's message. Instead, he says, Republicans need to convince blacks that smaller government, education reform and tough criminal-justice policies are in their self-interest.
If Mr. Barbour is right, the Republicans are failing miserably to put that message across. An overwhelming 86 percent of blacks said in the Times/CBS poll that the Democratic Party, not the Republican Party, was better able to help people achieve the American Dream. And numerous polls have shown blacks far more inclined than whites to favor government spending for social welfare.
Ron Walters, head of the political science department at Howard University, has been saying for several years that Republican policies were "too full of venom" for blacks to pay much attention to them. The Rev. Jesse Jackson said in Tennessee recently, "Once you take the cover off the book, what you find inside is not Jack Kemp but Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott and Pat Buchanan."
Mr. Kemp is relatively popular among blacks, though not very well known. According to the Times/CBS poll, 15 percent of blacks have a favorable impression of him while 20 percent have an unfavorable impression. Still, choosing him has not helped Mr. Dole's ratings; 6 percent of blacks say they view Mr. Dole positively, while 47 percent say they have a negative view.
Soon after the Republican convention, Mr. Kemp promised to seek votes "from the South Side of Chicago to the east side of Harlem," and he has made good on his pledge, campaigning in Harlem and in inner-city neighborhood in Chicago, Los Angeles and elsewhere, though to paltry crowds.
Trying to send a signal of inclusiveness, convention organizers put General Powell in a prominent position on the program and gave coveted speaking spots to the two black Republican Congressmen, J. C. Watts of Oklahoma and Gary A. Franks of Connecticut. Kay Cole James, a conservative black Christian from Virginia, called the roll of states for the nomination of Mr. Dole.
But only 2.6 percent of Republican delegates were black, compared with 21 percent at the Democrats' convention. Only 1 member of the Republican National Committee is black, compared with 88 on the Democrats' committee, and only 11 state legislators nationwide are black, compared with 539 Democrats.
Most of the Republican convention delegates were chosen in a process where the Christian Coalition had decisive influence, and the group also dominated the writing of the platform, which was full of planks unpalatable to blacks.
"Younger blacks are somewhat more receptive to the Republican Party than the parents and grandparents, who formed their views in the days of Roosevelt and Johnson," Mr. Williams said. "The potential is there, in the medium-term future. But first the Republicans will have to show us that they are the party of Kemp and Powell, not the party of Gingrich and the coalition."

HEADLINE: Beckoning Foreign Investors;
North Korea Opens the Door, a Crack, to Capitalism

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: RAJIN, North Korea, Sept. 16

 BODY:
When a three-day conference aimed at luring foreign investors drew to a close on Sunday, Kim Jong U, a senior North Korean official, proudly announced his biggest catch. The Emperor International Holdings group of Hong Kong had agreed to spend $180 million to build a five-star hotel and casino along the picturesque coast north of town.
A gambling den is probably not what North Korea had in mind when it set up a free trade zone centered on this town and the neighboring one of Sonbong. But so eager is Mr. Kim to have the zone succeed that he is willing to accept just about any business, provided that it does not endanger national security, pollute the environment or use obsolete technology. 
 The Rajin-Sonbong Free Economic and Trade Zone could mark the beginning of a transformation for North Korea, a Stalinist society that remains one of the most closed and rigid on earth. With its factories now largely idle and people going hungry, North Korea has made this remote northeastern corner -- sealed off from the rest of the nation by a barbed-wire fence -- a laboratory for its opening to the world.
As in China, the opening of the first North Korean free trade area could lead to economic changes elsewhere in the country. But for now, Government officials are noncommittal, partly because they don't want potential investors to bypass this zone in hopes that a less remote area of the country will open up, and partly because they worry that free enterprise will weaken tight political control. "We have to first determine whether it is good for us," Mr. Kim said. "If it is, we can swallow it. If it isn't, we can spit it out."
For now, he will have his hands full just filling this zone. With its central planning and lack of experience with credit, North Korea hardly seems an ideal place to do business. [Tense relations with its neighbors -- as exemplified by Wednesday's incident in which North Korean agents infiltrated South Korea by submarine -- can also turn off investors.]
Movements are highly restricted. A Western business man based in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, said he was not allowed to travel anywhere but the airport and the golf course without permission. Another said potential investors in a Rajin airport dropped out when they could not get visas to enter the country in a timely manner.
Even for those who do want to do business in North Korea, this rural corn-growing area of 140,000 people may not be the best location. The nearest airport with regular jet service is in Yanji, China, a bone-jarring, five-hour drive away.
Still, some pioneers are coming in, pointing out that China's economic liberalization also drew many skeptics at first. "This will be the next Shenzhen," said Albert Yeung, chairman of the Emperor group, referring enthusiastically to the booming industrial zone near Hong Kong that was China's first free trade zone.
By the end of the investment conference -- presumably the largest gathering of capitalists in North Korea's history, with 440 executives, academics and journalists from 26 nations -- the prevailing mood about the zone seemed to have changed from "not a chance" to "maybe."
Mr. Kim announced that contracts had been signed for six projects worth a total of $270 million. In addition to the hotel and casino, a bank will be built by Emperor, a toy factory by a Hong Kong company, and a hospital by a Korean living in Japan. There were also tentative deals for 10 projects worth $570 million.
This came on top of about $34 million invested so far, including the leasing of land by Royal Dutch/Shell for what is expected to be a fuel-storage facility.
The figures given by North Korea must be taken with a grain of salt -- or perhaps a whole salt shaker -- since the Government is prone to exaggerate. At the conference, for instance, Rim Tae Dok, vice chairman of North Korea's Committee for the Promotion of External Economic Cooperation, said that companies like General Motors, Boeing, Chrysler, MCI Communications and Raytheon "have either completed field inspections and started investment, or are looking for investment opportunities."
While officials from these companies have indeed make trips to North Korea, at least some of them have not gone beyond that, especially since American companies are now barred from most business here under the Trading With the Enemy Act. "We're not too interested in breaking too many swords to figure out what's going on in North Korea," said David Jerome, vice president for corporate affairs of G.M.'s Asia-Pacific operations.
Most investments are coming from Chinese companies, or from Hong Kong business executives, many of whom also played an important role in developing China. "Rajin will take off because of the Asians, not because of the West," said Ronald J. Savage, an official of Loxley, a Thai conglomerate that is investing about $30 million to build the telephone system here.
The only big American company detected at the conference was Monsanto. To get its foot in the door, it is thinking of providing agricultural assistance under an exemption to the embargo for humanitarian aid.
"How many places in the world do we have virgin opportunities?" asked Donald H. Abresch, president of Monsanto Korea Inc.
Others here from the United States were mainly Korean-Americans drawn for political or sentimental reasons. Suzy Lee, who runs LB International, a New York investment company, said she was interested in building a hotel and golf course.
Japan's big companies also stayed away, with the exception of giant trading companies like Mitsubishi and Sumitomo. Shinwa Bussan Kaisha Ltd., which is affiliated with Mitsui, and Toyo Engineering together did a free assessment of the zone for North Korea, no doubt in hopes of getting business later.
The Rajin-Sonbong zone is part of a broader effort, led by United Nations development agencies, to help the area around the Tumen River, where the borders of North Korea, China and Russia meet. The hope is that combining the natural resources of eastern Russia and Mongolia, the labor of China and North Korea, and the capital and technology of South Korea and Japan could make northeast Asia the world's next growth area.
Such help cannot come too soon. North Korea's gross national product, which at $20 billion is about equal to the annual revenue of BankAmerica or GTE, has been shrinking at an estimated 5 percent a year. Factories are idle for lack of fuel, and ill-fed workers are reported to be dismantling factory machinery and bartering the scrap metal for food from China. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991, North Korea no longer gets cheap oil and other economic support. It desperately needs foreign currency to pay for imports.
Some experts fear that North Korea could collapse, sending millions of refugees streaming to South Korea, China and Japan. Or, a desperate regime might start a war against South Korea to divert public attention from internal problems.
Even if the Rajin-Sonbong zone succeeds, it may be too little too late.
"I am advocating a tourniquet; they are applying Band-Aids," said Marcus Noland, an economist with the Institute for International Economics in Washington. He estimated it would take $500 billion to $750 billion of investment over 20 to 25 years to bring North Korea's per-capita income up to 60 percent of South Korea's current $10,000.
The 288-square-mile zone, bigger than Singapore, does have some strengths. If its port, built by Japanese occupiers in the 1930's, can be modernized, Rajin is ideally positioned to serve northeastern China, Siberia and even Europe by the Trans-Siberian Railroad. Already some earth movers, steel and other products are being shipped from Pusan in South Korea to Rajin, where they are then carried by rail or truck into northeastern China.
The rugged coast and wooded hills could attract vacationers if there were easier ways to get here. Rather than the next Shenzhen, some people think the free trade zone will become the next Macao, the Portuguese-controlled playground near Hong Kong.
The list of problems is similarly long, and prospects for manufacturing, including some clearly impractical projects like a liquid crystal display factory, are beyond reach. North Korea's estimated population is relatively small for this region -- about 23 million -- and wages in the zone, $80 a month, are not particularly cheap compared with those paid in some developing countries.
"China has a big market," said John Lye, assistant vice president of the Hong Kong office of Merrill Lynch. "Here you're not very sure."
Developing the required facilities and services will cost several billion dollars that North Korea doesn't have. It is not a member of the World Bank or similar international lending organizations, although it is now thinking of applying to join the Asian Development Bank. Private institutions will shun it because the nation is already in arrears on billions of dollars in foreign debt.
Tensions between North and South have kept South Korean companies, which would be the most willing investors, out of action. Authorities in Seoul, wanting to avoid a collapse of North Korea that would overwhelm their own economy, officially relaxed restrictions on doing business in the North in November 1994. But since then, they have approved only one project -- light manufacturing by the Daewoo group in the port of Nampo.
As for American companies, the restrictions on doing business with North Korea were supposed to be gradually lifted under a 1994 agreement in which North Korea agreed to give up its suspected nuclear weapons program.
But so far, few rules have been relaxed -- in part because Pyongyang has refused to talk with Seoul, as is also called for in the agreement. And with Bob Dole criticizing President Clinton for softness in foreign policy, not much more is expected until after the election. The exception could be a slight loosening of restrictions if Pyongyang agrees to a briefing on four-nation peace talks proposed by President Clinton and South Korea's President, Kim Young Sam, in April.
American companies pushed to have the embargo on Vietnam lifted when they decided they were losing out to companies from other nations. North Korea's best hope is that a groundswell of investment here by Hong Kong and South Korean companies would prompt American companies to do that again.

HEADLINE: An Anchor and an Archway for Times Sq.

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In the latest new development planned for the Times Square area, executives said yesterday that the northeast corner of 42d Street and Eighth Avenue would be anchored by a multiplex movie house, a huge phalanx of neon signs and a Las Vegas-theme restaurant, complete with entertainers but without the gambling.
The plan, coming amid a frenzy of demolition, theater restoration and store openings in Times Square, was described by city and state officials as a critical step in the neighborhood's revitalization because it puts in place a major piece of the puzzle for the historic 42d Steet theater strip, the fabled "Deuce" between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. And it will add 13 new screens to a strip that already has a 25-screen movie house planned across the street. 
 "We now have an anchor and an archway to enter the Times Square project area from the West," Charles A. Gargano, New York State's chief economic development official, said at a news conference called by the Tishman Realty and Construction Company, developer of the corner.
The plan for the site, kitty-corner from the Port Authority bus depot, was announced just as the terminal is being prepared for a new look consistent with the glitz of a revitalized 42d Street. The Port Authority plans by early next year to cover the depot's exteriors facing 42d Street and Eighth Avenue with neon signs, and hopes to sell development rights above the section of the terminal at the southwest corner of 42d Street.
The parcel being developed by Tishman is ultimately to include a hotel on Eighth Avenue from 42d Street to 43d Street that is to rise over the retail complex described yesterday. Tishman had been selected to build the hotel and retail complex by the city and the state.
The hotel plan has been delayed since the Walt Disney Company, which was to join in the venture and operate time-share apartments in the Tishman hotel, withdrew earlier this year. John L. Tishman, the company's chairman, said the project was now on hold until more favorable terms are available from banks or others that extend financing.
Under its agreement, Tishman has until 2003 to begin construction of the hotel. Nonethless, company executives said yesterday that they hope to begin work on the hotel by the fall of 1998, about when the retail part of the complex is to be completed.
Yesterday's announcement reflected the interest among national and international retailers lining up to claim a stake in the square's fast-moving renaissance and its planned transformation from a symbol of urban decline to a glitzy center of family entertainment that in some ways resembles a giant outdoor mall.
Indeed, the complex to be built by Tishman is named E-Walk -- short for Entertainment Walk -- including 200,000 square feet of contiguous retail space that would itself qualify as a mall except for the absence of an interior atrium to allow people to walk from one store to another without going out on the street.
Companies taking space in the project include Sony Theaters, which plans the 13-screen multiplex a few doors east of Eighth Avenue. That theater is to be directly across the street from the 25-screen multiplex planned by AMC Entertainment Inc.
The other retail tenant announced yesterday was Vegas, a theme restaurant at 42d Street and Eighth Avenue to be operated by Creative Cafes. Executives said the restaurant would be the first of what they hope will be a chain of diners with nonstop, Las Vegas-style entertainment by singers, dancers and comedians.

Four A's Applauds Pataki Tax Decision

BYLINE: By Robyn Meredith 

 BODY:
The American Association of Advertising Agencies is hailing a decision by Gov. George E. Pataki of New York to sign legislation that will modify and eventually eliminate a "vice presidents" tax, which affects agencies as well as the securities and insurance industries.
O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the association, known as the Four A's, said that "the outcome of this tax reform will be new jobs and growth" in service industries "that are vital" to the economy of New York City. 
 The legislation will eventually reduce taxes paid by corporations that incur substantial costs for salaries and other compensation for corporate officers as well as certain shareholders. The term vice presidents tax was coined because corporations have been taxed on the number of officers like vice presidents that they have; the tax was a reason why many agencies have named top executives as partners or directors.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DEMOCRAT;
President Designates A Monument Across Utah

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: GRAND CANYON, Ariz., Sept. 18

 BODY:
With the striated pink cliffs and the purple depths of the Grand Canyon behind him, President Clinton today designated nearly two million acres of the red rock country of Utah as a national monument, calling it "some of the most remarkable land in the world."
Accompanied by Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Clinton, in khakis and cowboy boots, spoke along the southern rim of the canyon near the spot where a Republican President, Theodore Roosevelt, came at the turn of the century to declare the glorious Grand Canyon itself a monument, protected from the mining interests that held claims to it. 
 Mr. Clinton quoted Mr. Roosevelt's own words: "You cannot improve upon it. What you can do is keep it for your children, your children's children, all who come after you." Several hundred people, including the actor Robert Redford, looked on.
By choosing to announce the creation of a Utah monument in neighboring Arizona, Mr. Clinton managed to fit in his second visit in two weeks to a state that has not voted for a Democrat since Harry S. Truman 48 years ago but which the Democrats believe Mr. Clinton has a chance to win this year.
In an era of supreme attention to campaign visuals, the stop also provided Mr. Clinton with a breathtaking backdrop -- and the branches of trees behind him had been tied back and down with yellow nylon cords to make sure the television cameras could record the full panorama. Just a day earlier Bob Dole came through the state and illustrated his anti-crime theme by visiting a dusty yard where a chain gang lives in prison tents behind barbed wire.
The entire Utah delegation to Congress opposes the establishment of 1.7 million acres of the state as the Canyons of the Escalante National Monument. They say the designation will block the development of the largest known coal reserves in the nation. But Mr. Clinton made the monument designation under the Antiquities Act of 1906, which protects unique resources, and it requires no Congressional approval.
The move allowed Mr. Clinton to showcase the issue of the environment, which has particular resonance on the West Coast, with little political risk since Utah, the most Republican state, is considered beyond his reach. He finished third there in 1992 behind Ross Perot.
The red rock canyons of south Utah, treasure troves of rock paintings of the Anasazi Indians, have been at the center of a struggle between conservationists and miners.
Andalex Resources, a Dutch-owned concern, has been planning to run a huge coal mining operation in what will be the heart of the national monument, and it has said it will try to fight the designation. The company has said its mine would employ 900 people and operate in a way that is environmentally sound.
The other major holder of a Federal coal lease in the area, Pacific Corporation, has agreed to give up its lease in exchange for money and land elsewhere, and Mr. Clinton said today that he hoped that Andalex would consent to a similar swap. "Mining jobs are good jobs, and mining is important to our national economy and to our national security," Mr. Clinton said. "But we can't have mines everywhere, and we shouldn't have mines that threaten our national treasures."
But Administration officials repeatedly skirted the question of whether the monument designation would actually prevent Andalex from mining. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said the President's proclamation "does not speak to the issue of mining claims" and that an environmental impact would determine whether and on what terms mining could proceed.
Pressed by reporters on whether the answer was "yes, no or maybe" for future mining, Mr. Babbitt replied, "The answer is all of the above. This proclamation does not dictate a conclusion about the future of that mine." The White House Press Secretary, Michael D. McCurry, suggested that the Government's leverage would come through the judgment about the environmental impact of the new roads, power lines and truck traffic required to move the coal in and out of the area.
Utah also has 200,000 acres of state land woven in with the federal property. Mr. Clinton acknowledged that mining on state and Federal lands generates revenues for Utah schools, and he said Mr. Babbitt would consult with Utah officials to find the state alternate pieces of land, with an eye to providing lands that can generate revenue for Utah's schools.
Neither Mr. Clinton nor Mr. Gore could resist giving personal testimonials about the canyon's vistas. Mr. Clinton recalled the summer of 1971 when he sat alone on a rock overlooking the canyon and "watched the colors change layer after layer after layer for two hours." Even now, he said, "in hectic, crazy times, in lonely, painful times, my mind drifts back to those two hours that I was alone on that rock."

HEADLINE: The Fed Should Keep Its Head

BYLINE: By Robert Eisner; Robert Eisner, an economics professor at Northwestern University, is the author of "The Misunderstood Economy."

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill.

 BODY:
How low would inflation have to be to calm the economic doomsayers? Right now, it is virtually zero. Consumer prices rose by a mere one-tenth of 1 percent last month, and producer prices are practically unchanged. Nevertheless, inflation hawks at the Federal Reserve are pressing for a rise in the most basic short-term interest rate when a Fed policy-making group meets on Tuesday.
The hawks' premise is that the economy is doing too well. So although there is virtually no current inflation, they say we must slow the economy to prevent future inflation. They want the Fed to tighten the money supply by raising the 5.25 percent Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another, by as much as one-half of a percentage point. 
 But increasing the Federal funds rate even slightly will have a ripple effect on other rates, because of the tighter money supply and the expectation that the Fed, once it starts raising rates, will continue to do so.
These higher interest rates will reduce consumer spending, as borrowing costs increase. They will curtail home buying and construction, as mortgage rates rise. They will cut state and local spending, as the costs of bond financing goes up. They will hold down business investment. And to the extent that the markets have not already anticipated higher rates, they will drive down stock prices. All this will contribute to lower sales and production, meaning that more people will be without jobs.
Why would any well-intentioned person want to reduce investment in the future and put people out of work? To the inflation hawks, unemployment is already too low. Their conclusion stems from one of the more dismal dogmas of our dismal science -- the belief that there is a "natural rate of unemployment" below which the economy cannot go without bringing accelerating inflation. That "natural" rate, until recently taken to be around 6 percent, is called the Nairu, the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment. Since unemployment has been below 6 percent for two years -- it is now 5.1 percent -- we are presumed to be in dire danger. Many of the alarmists say the economy can grow little more than 2 percent annually without reducing unemployment further. Since output grew at 4.8 percent annually in this year's second quarter, the economy must now be restrained, they say.
We can hope that a majority of the Fed group meeting on Tuesday sees the folly of these arguments. Wages have begun to catch up with past inflation. But labor costs, counting total compensation and productivity, are not rising. And with good profits and considerable competition, companies are unlikly to pass the cost increases that do occur.
What's more, after two years of unemployment below the "natural" rate, other economists are questioning whether the Nairu is applicable. Some of us doubt that the concept makes any sense at all. Others say that while high unemployment may reduce inflation, low unemployment may not increase it. Prof. Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist who has long set the "natural" rate of unemployment at 6 percent, now states that it is more like 5.1 percent, the current jobless rate. Accelerating inflation, he argues, is not a serious threat now and is unlikely to be in the near future.
The Fed would do well to remember that along with its responsibility to curb inflation, it has a mandate -- however ignored -- to reduce unemployment. Its legal obligation is to aim for a 4 percent jobless rate. And each percentage point of reduced unemployment puts more than 1.3 million people to work.
If I were running the Fed, I would urge lowering interest rates to stimulate growth and reduce unemployment even more. The best we can hope for on Tuesday, however, is that the Fed's policy-making group will come to order and quickly adjourn -- without raising rates.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Modest Increases As Economy Looks Stronger

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rose moderately against most leading currencies yesterday, bolstered by economic reports that might help the Federal Reserve to decide to raise interest rates next week to try to keep inflation in check.
The Commerce Department reported that builders broke ground on new homes and apartments in August at the fastest rate in two and a half years. And the Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims fell last week. 
 "That meant that people were starting to look for a Fed rate hike," when the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets monetary policy, meets on Tusday, said Peter Wadkins, a vice president at the Standard Chartered Bank.
Higher interest rates often help the American currency by making dollar-denominated deposits more attractive to foreign investors.
In late New York trading, the dollar cost 109.40 yen, up from 109.15 yen on Wednesday. The dollar also rose to 1.5132 marks from 1.5091 marks. The British pound cost $1.5520, down from $1.5603.
 Though the dollar benefited from the strong economic reports, the mark failed to rise after the release of generally positive news on the German economy. Business confidence was reported to have improved in August. And the German money supply, which the central bank sees as an important indicator of inflationary trends, unexpectedly grew at an annualized rate of 8.7 percent in August compared with an 8.6 percent rise in July. That was above economists' forecast for growth of about 8 percent and marked the first pickup in M-3 growth since February.
Typically, such figures might be expected to strengthen the mark by diminishing hopes for another decrease in German interest rates. But Germany and France are spearheading the effort to introduce a single European currency in January 1999 and a growing belief that this goal will be realized could lessen the mark's status as a currency haven.
"The failure of the mark to benefit from the European news sort of sapped the strength of the mark against the dollar," said Chris Widness, an international economist at Chase Securities Inc. "I think it's because the market is convinced that as long as there is a political will in Europe to proceed with monetary union, it really doesn't matter that much what the economic data are."

HEADLINE: Builders Start New Homes At Fast Clip

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 19

 BODY:
Builders broke ground on new homes and apartments at the fastest rate in nearly two and a half years during August, the Commerce Department said today.
Housing construction starts, which were predicted to decline modestly, instead increased 4.5 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.525 million units, the highest rate since 1.531 million in March 1994. 
 June and July building rates were also revised upward. The strength in housing reignited fears, which had subsided somewhat with recent economic reports, that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates next week to try to slow the rate of growth.
"The continued high level of home building is another strong piece of evidence that the economy still has plenty of momentum, adding pressure for the Fed to nudge short-term rates a little higher," said David Orr, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C.
Strong job growth and rising incomes have fired up consumer confidence despite higher long-term interest rates. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage rose to 7.95 percent in August from 7.03 percent in January.
And rates have continued to rise, although they dipped this week. Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.14 percent this week, down from 8.28 percent last week, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said today. On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 5.83 percent, down from 5.9 percent last week. Fifteen-year mortgages averaged 7.64 percent this week, down from 7.81 percent a week earlier.
A separate report today, from the Labor Department, showed that initial claims for unemployment benefits fell by 2,000, to 329,000, in the week that ended last Friday. The four-week moving average, which smoothes out seasonal variations, was up by 750, to 326,750.
The strong housing report drove prices down in the bond market as concern mounted that the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets monetary policy, could raise short-term interest rates at its meeting on Tuesday in a bid to head off inflation pressures.
David Berson, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, said the housing industry "remains extremely healthy, and at this point in time there are no clear signs of a downturn."
The department pushed up its estimate of July housing starts to an annual rate of 1.46 million from a previously reported 1.455 million and said June housing starts were at a stronger rate of 1.49 million a year, instead of the 1.474 million originally reported.
Housing starts in August were nearly 9 percent above the rate in August 1995, when they were at a rate of 1.401 million.
Particularly noteworthy was the pickup in starts on single-family homes, which are generally seen as a measure of optimism that consumers are willing and able to take on long-term financing commitments.
Construction starts on new single-family homes jumped 8.3 percent last month to a rate of 1.238 million a year, after a 5.5 percent decline in July. The August rate on single-family homes was also the highest since March 1994, when it was at 1.28 million.
By contrast, the building rate for apartments dropped 9.5 percent, to 287,000, after a 12.8 percent increase in July.
The overall strength in construction was broadly based. Only the Midwest posted a decline in August, to a rate of 342,000 a year, but that followed a 16 percent jump in July.
Starts in the West surged 13.5 percent, to 378,000 a year, and in the Northeast they gained 7 percent, to a rate of 138,000. Construction in the South, the nation's biggest housing market, picked up 2.8 percent, to a rate of 667,000.

HEADLINE: A Chorus of Critics in Thailand Is Trying to Oust Premier

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Sept. 19

 BODY:
"I used to strut the streets in foreign countries, so proud to be Thai," said Chatichai Choonhavan, a former Prime Minister who is now an opposition member of Parliament. "Now I hate to tell people where I'm from."
Hyperbole, invective and expressions of angst are thick in the air this week as Thailand's opposition attacks Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa in a marathon no-confidence session intended to oust him after just 14 months in power. 
 This is a time of discontent for Thailand, which has been riding high on an export-led economic boom for more than a decade. Corruption, military coups, urban chaos and growing social inequities have been overlooked as living standards soared and shopping malls, factories and luxury cars proliferated.
But a series of economic setbacks this year have shaken the nation's confidence and prompted calls for political change.
Export growth has tumbled from about 24 percent last year to 3.8 percent. The overall economic growth rate has slipped from 8.6 percent last year to a projected 7 percent in 1996. There is talk of devaluing the baht, the Thai currency. Last week Moody's Investor Service, the American credit-rating agency, lowered the country's short-term credit standing, and the stock market plunged to its lowest point in three years.
"Remember the days when our pockets were full?" Mr. Chatichai said, warming to his hyperbole. "Not money from within our country but from abroad. We used to go out and get rich with foreign money. Now look at the golf courses, the condos and housing estates that go dark at night because nobody lives there."
The country's unhappiness has focused on its Prime Minister, an old-style rural politician known popularly as the Walking ATM for his generosity with constituents. He is seen by Bangkok's elite as a throwback to a deep-rooted tradition of the politics of greed.
Not only opposition politicians but also a growing number of business executives, political commentators, economic analysts and public opinion polls are calling for his ouster.
"Premier Has to Go if Thailand Is to Survive," read the headline on an editorial this week in the English-language daily The Nation.
Mr. Banharn, 64, denies wrongdoing and has vowed to fight back, exclaiming recently to journalists, "What have I done wrong?"
His tenuous six-party coalition, which holds 209 seats in the 391-seat legislature, has said it plans to hold together to defeat the no-confidence motion, though many of its members have joined the criticisms of him.
Even if he survives the vote, expected on Saturday, some press reports suggest that his coalition partners will force him to step down. Mr. Banharn also has the option of dissolving Parliament and calling new elections, which would be held within three months.
But he has stated his ambition to be the first Thai Prime Minister ever to serve out a full four-year term, uninterrupted by coups or the political collapse of a government.
The three-day parliamentary session that began on Wednesday, in which two dozen legislators have lined up to castigate Mr. Banharn, is being watched avidly on live television. When Wednesday's broadcast was cut short for the evening news at 9 P.M., the Government station was deluged with protests, The Bangkok Post reported today.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Drop in Price

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dropped yesterday after a strong housing report alarmed investors and a Government report on manufacturing sent mixed signals to a market already sharply divided over the possibility of a rise in interest rates.
The 30-year bond fell 13/32 , to a price of 9613/32 , to yield 7.04 percent, up from 7.01 percent on Wednesday. 
 Analysts said the Philadephia Federal Reserve Bank's regional business survey for September sent mixed signals to a market that was looking for something more definitive, as it tried to figure out whether the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates next week.
The overall business outlook index fell to 13.9, which was encouraging for those who believe the Fed will refrain from raising rates because inflation was under control. But the prices-paid index was up to 18.0 in September and, in the minds of market participants, higher prices in the mind of market participants means a higher probability of inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income investments like Treasury securities.
Also a stronger-than-expected August housing starts report, released by the Commerce Department, raised expectations of an interest rate rise scenario next Tuesday.
"Today's report, which showed starts up 4.5 percent last month, reinforces the view that this sector is indeed strong, despite high mortgage interest rates," said Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "These data are more ammunition for those policy makers wanting to raise interest rates and reinforces our view that the Fed will implement a 25-basis-point hike in rates in next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting."
The weekly jobless claims report for the week ended last Saturday showed a decline of 2,000 from the previous week, to 329,000. Ms. Schaja believed it confirmed perceptions of a strong labor market.
Kim Rupert, an economist with MMS International, San Francisco, said yesterday morning's Philadelphia Fed report did not clarify Fed policy uncertainties. She said, "The moderation in the Philly Fed index, the slowdown in orders, the drop in delivery times, and the decline in building permits helped support the slowdown scenario."
"However," she added, "the rise in the Philly price paid and prices received components, the rise in employment, and the resilience in the housing sector could argue for a 25- basis-point rate hike." But she says the Fed has been patient, and with retail sales and consumer credit showing signs of weakness, and still benign readings on many of the inflation indicators, her firm's assumption is that the Fed will choose to wait.
But no doubt it was the jump in the housing report that sent up the warning flag yesterday. Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at Gruntal & Company, said, "Everyone knows these numbers are volatile, but it's hard for the bond market to shake the thought that the economy is still strong."
He said there was some anticipatory positioning going on ahead of a Fed announcement next week. "My suspicion is that dealers would want to be light inventory-wise going into the F.O.M.C. meeting next week," he said. His reference was to the Federal Open Market Committee.
Elsewhere, corporate borrowing slowed yesterday as yields on Treasury securities rose. Still, there were some companies looking to sell securities in case rates rise in the coming weeks.
The Philip Morris Companies priced $650 million of five-year bonds yesterday through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley & Company. Given a coupon of 7.25 percent, the notes were priced at 99.67, to yield 7.33 percent, or about 67 basis points more than the when-issued Treasury note at the time of pricing. Noncallable, the notes are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by Standard & Poor's.
In when-issued trading late yesterday, the two-year note to be sold next week was being offered at a price to yield 6.28 percent and the five-year, 6.63 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S. Changes Policy on Polio Inoculation, Recommending Salk Vaccine for First Doses

 BODY:
Inactivated polio vaccine, familiar to millions in the 1950's and 60's as the Salk vaccine, was reinstated on Wednesday as part of the Federal Government's recommended schedule of childhood immunizations.
After two years of study, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta formally recommended a change from four doses of oral polio vaccine, which uses the live but "attenuated" virus, to two doses of inactivated polio vaccine, given as an injection, followed by two doses of the oral vaccine. 
 The transmission of polio from person to person -- "wild" polio in medical terms -- has been eradicated in the Western Hemisphere since 1991. But 8 to 10 cases of polio are diagnosed in the United States each year as a result of the oral polio vaccine itself. Virtually no cases of vaccine-associated polio have been attributed to the inactivated vaccine.
Under the new recommendation, by taking the inactivated vaccine first an infant would gain protection against the tiny risk of contracting polio from the oral vaccine.
The disease-control centers estimated that providing the polio shots would add as much as $6.50 to the cost of immunizing each child who visited a public health clinic and $1.00 to $1.50 more for children who receive their immunizations at offices of private physicians. Over all, the change would cost the health care system $15 million to $16 million a year.
The centers said it would be acceptable for infants still to receive either four doses of oral vaccine or to take all four doses in the form of the Salk shots, since both types of vaccinations appear to protect against polio.
A coalition of minority health care organizations said yesterday in a conference call with reporters that it would petition President Clinton to delay the policy change because of concern that it could result in a lower overall rate of immunization for all childhood diseases among inner city and rural children.
The coalition said that adding two polio injections to the 13 shots already recommended for measles, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis B and other diseases would discourage some parents from bringing their children back repeatedly to doctors to complete the entire series of immunizations or increase the number of shots in a single visit.
"In underserved communities, this change would have an impact not only on the rates of immunization for polio but would jeopardize the whole immunization schedule and put children at risk for other vaccine-preventable diseases," said Dr. Jane Delgado, president of the National Coalition of Hispanic Health and Human Services Organizations.
Proponents of the change disagree. "I don't know of one parent who would forego a vaccination because it is given by shot," said John Salamone, of Oakton, Va., whose son, David, now 6, contracted polio from an infant immunization with the oral vaccine.
"Every other immunization is given by shot," Mr. Salamone said in a telephone interview. "This is the exception."
Mr. Salamone said that at the time of his son's vaccination "we really had no idea that there was any risk at all and, in fact, we had no idea that there were choices." The policy change is "a no-brainer and should have been made years ago," he said.
Dr. Walter A. Orenstein, director of C.D.C.'s national immunization program, said the agency had discussed the issue with groups of minority parents. "Once they understood the issue, about 80 percent of the economically disadvantaged parents said they would prefer inactivated vaccine," Dr. Orenstein said.
Members of the minority coalition said the change would pose dangers to far more people than the small number who might be spared polio infection.
"According to the best data we have, there are only 5 to 10 cases of vaccine-associated polio every year," said Dr. Norma J. Goodwin, president of Health Watch, an organization that promotes minority health improvement. "While that is extremely regrettable, public health policy is supposed to be about what is good for the public at large. This change is being made to prevent one case of vaccine-associated polio for every 2.5 million vaccinations."
The minority health coalition said there were no data to support the contention that the changed schedule would reduce vaccine-associated polio. But the centers estimates it would cut the number of cases by 75 percent to 80 percent, or down to two or three cases per year.
The change in policy could create a potential windfall for Connaught Laboratories of Swiftwater, Pa., currently the world's only maker of inactivated polio vaccine, and could cost millions of dollars for Wyeth Lederle Vaccines and Pediatrics, of Radnor, Pa., currently the only maker of the oral polio vaccine.
Connaught will sell about 500,000 doses of the inactivated vaccine this year, said a company spokeswoman, Chris Grant. If only half of next year's four million newborns are given the inactivated vaccine, the number of doses would rise to about four million, she said. Connaught could sell as manyas eight million doses a year if the recommendations are universally adopted.

HEADLINE: Semiconductor Issues Rally in Mixed Day as Dow Dips 9.62

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Semiconductor shares rallied again, but stocks were mixed yesterday as interest rates rose once more in the bond market after a strong reading on housing construction aggravated inflation worries.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.62, to 5,867.74, its third straight losing session after two record highs. The total retreat has amounted to less than 22 points, with many investors remaining optimistic for a run at 6,000. 
 Most broad market measures turned positive after a weak start with bonds. The Nasdaq market rose for the 10th straight session, continuing its gradual crawl back toward record levels amid renewed investor interest in computer-industry shares.
Stocks initially followed bonds lower after the Government reported that construction of new homes and apartments unexpectedly shot up in August to the highest level in nearly two and a half years.
The report was the last major economic reading before Tuesday's Federal Reserve meeting on interest-rate policy. It spurred worries that rising demand for building materials and home furnishings will pressure an already tight labor market, forcing higher payroll costs that might be passed on to consumers.
So far, there has been little evidence that retail prices are rising. But analysts have been divided over whether economic growth is slowing enough to contain wage and other production cost pressures without the central bank's intervention. Higher Fed lending rates would help contain inflation by slowing spending and demand, but that could hurt corporate profits.
As bond prices fell, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond a key determinant of corporate and consumer borrowing costs rose to 7.04 percent from Wednesday's 7.01 percent.
Despite the higher rates, stocks started rebounding in the late morning and early afternoon on optimism that the signs of economic growth could translate into better earnings, analysts said.
"What's happened this afternoon is the realization that the economy is rocking right along," said Jim Weiss, deputy chief investment officer for equities at State Street Research and Management Company in Boston.
"There's no evidence that inflation is flaring up, so the market is looking through the news of the day to the underlying conditions," Mr. Weiss said.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 13-to-11 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 398.6 million shares, about even with Wednesday's pace.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.53, to 683.00, and the Big Board's composite index rose 0.50, to 363.94, but the American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 1.21, to 565.44.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 6.38, to 1,212.09.
Semiconductor shares were among the session's strongest issues, with Intel continuing this week's rally on news of its surprisingly strong third-quarter sales.
Intel rose 1 3/8, to 97, in active Nasdaq trading. Among chip makers on the Big Board, Micron Technology rose 2, to 27 3/8; Texas Instruments rose 2 1/4, to 52 1/4; LSI Logic rose 1 1/8, to 23 3/4, and Cypress Semiconductor rose 7/8, to 12 3/8.

BILL CLINTON
 
Speaking yesterday in Centralia, Wash., about House Republicans:
"I remember well in 1994 when they went across the country and they won the Congress back. 
 "They won as many seats in the state of Washington, including this one, as in any state in the country, and they said a few clear things.
"They said we have this 'Contract With America' and it will move American forward.
"And they neglected to say they wanted to cut education. They wanted to weaken the environment. They wanted to raise taxes on the poorest working people. They wanted to permit people to raid their workers' pension funds.
"They wanted to abolish Americorps, abolish our student loan program, abolish the safe and drug-free schools program. They wanted to turn Medicare into a two-tier system. They wanted to stop Medicaid's guarantee of health care to poor children, to pregnant women, to families with people with disabilities, to the elderly in our nursing homes.
"They left out all that fine print in 1994, but when they took office, we saw what they wanted. They also attacked us for two things. They said the economic program which passed in 1993 raised the taxes of ordinary Americans -- their income taxes. It wasn't true."

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Dole Inside Out

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Bob Dole had one main thing going for him as a candidate for President: He was a man of steadiness, of responsibility, of character. With him, there would not be the flip-flops of Bill Clinton's White House. You might not share his ideology, but you knew where you stood with Bob Dole. You could trust him.
How bizarre it is to say that now. For, one month into the campaign, Senator Dole has become the flip-flop candidate. He has allowed himself to be manipulated into abandoning one after another of his established beliefs for the hope of short-term political advantage. 
It began at the Republican Convention, when he raised the banner of supply-side economics that he had always mocked as self-delusion. He told the country with a straight face that he would cut taxes by $550 billion and balance the budget at the same time -- without touching the biggest spending items: defense, Social Security and Medicare.
The economic irresponsibility has got worse since then. The other week he was in New Mexico, and he promised that while he would abolish the Energy Department he would preserve two of its costliest enterprises -- the weapons laboratories at Los Alamos and Sandia in that state. If there is any more ludicrous duplication in the Federal budget than those two laboratories, it is a secret.
In San Diego, Senator Dole said his tax-cut plan included "a $500 per child tax credit for low- and middle-income families." Analysis since then, by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, has shown that 28 million children of low-income parents who work would get nothing from the Dole plan. That is because it would give the credit only to those whose Federal income tax exceeds the earned-income tax credit already available to the working poor.
Immediately after the San Diego convention, Senator Dole flatly repudiated one plank in the Republican platform. It called for a constitutional amendment to repeal the 14th Amendment's provision that everyone born in this country is a United States citizen. A sponsor of the plank said women were "coming across the border just to have babies."
Mr. Dole's rejection of that radical plank seemed to put him among opponents of extreme measures against illegal immigrants. But now he is using his still-strong influence in Congress on behalf of another harsh idea, to bar the children of undocumented aliens from public schools -- a step that the Supreme Court in 1982 held unconstitutional.
The schooling ban was added to a pending immigration bill in the House. Last week Mr. Dole sent word that he wanted Republicans to insist on keeping it in the final bill. He hopes thereby to win votes in California -- and to kill the bill in the Senate, thus denying President Clinton credit for signing an immigration-reform measure.
The rawness of those tactics outraged Mr. Dole's old friend Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming. He said Mr. Dole was being "ill served on the issue" by advisers, and the national interest was being "subverted by Machiavellian mumbo-jumbo."
The most surprising of the Dole flip-flops was on the treaty to prohibit the production, sale or use of chemical weapons. Negotiation of the treaty was started by the Republican Administrations of Presidents Reagan and Bush, with Senator Dole's support.
The Senate was to debate the treaty last week. But at the last minute right-wing opponents of this and other arms control measures produced a letter from Senator Dole saying that he had changed his mind and joined the opposition. Faced with defeat, sponsors canceled Senate consideration.
The reasons given by Mr. Dole for his switch were embarrassingly contradictory. He said that the ban on poison gas would be too easy to avoid -- and that the provisions of the treaty for inspection of suspect sites were too intrusive.
Bob Dole has above all been responsible on issues of foreign policy, repeatedly putting the national interest ahead of politics. That is why his political turnabout on the chemical weapons treaty was so troubling. It will be harder, from now on, to say what many did: We may disagree with him on this or that, but Bob Dole is a serious man.

HEADLINE: Elizabeth B. Noyce, 65, Benefactor of Maine With Vast Settlement From Her Divorce

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Elizabeth Bottomley Noyce, a microchip millionaire's scorned first wife who showed as much imagination and verve in deploying her half of his Silicon Valley fortune as he had in making it, died on Tuesday at her seaside home in Bremen, Me. She was 65 and had been the state's premier philanthropist and most innovative investor for two decades.
Her lawyer, Owen Wells, noting that Mrs. Noyce had long suffered from emphysema, said the cause was a heart attack. 
 The daughter of a blue-collar worker from Auburn, Mass., who had to hold two jobs to support his family in the Depression, Mrs. Noyce was majoring in English at Tufts University in the early 1950's and dreaming of becoming a writer when she signed on as costume director of a summer theatrical production and caught the eye of one of the cast members, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology named Robert N. Noyce.
The couple were married in 1953, and Mrs. Noyce, who had dreamed of writing novels and short stories, became the most dutiful of corporate wives, bearing four children and following her husband from job to job, including a somewhat reluctant move to California for a woman who never felt comfortable away from her beloved New England.
"We were under the distinct impression that we would try it for a year and if I didn't like it we wouldn't stay," she recalled years later, suggesting that her husband had forgotten the bargain: "We stayed 19 years."
By then the life of the blue-collar worker's daughter had changed considerably, largely because her husband had become a co-inventor of the microchip, which laid the foundation for the vast personal computer industry, and had helped found three of the industry's premier companies, including the giant Intel Corporation.
Her life changed even more in 1975 when Mr. Noyce left her to marry an Intel executive. Although bitter over the circumstances of the breakup of her marriage, Mrs. Noyce, whose husband died in 1990, managed to console herself somewhat in the divorce. Under California's community property laws she claimed half his Intel stock and all his other assets, including full title to their 50-acre Maine estate, where Mrs. Noyce had been spending summers.
How much she received from the divorce could not be determined yesterday, and a spokesman for Intel, which has a market capitalization of $86 billion, could not say how much stock she owned at the time of her death. Mr. Wells, her lawyer, said, however, that after all her charitable donations, her estate was worth $100 million to $1 billion.
Putting her husband and California behind her, Mrs. Noyce did not so much move to Maine as adopt the state.
In a whirlwind of philanthropy that began almost as soon as she settled into her house on Muscongus Bay and continued the rest of her life, she systematically gave away some $75 million, primarily to Maine charities.
Oh, there would be the occasional out-of-state donation -- a million to Tufts here, a half-million to Harvard there -- but for the most part Mrs. Noyce, whose donations covered the gamut of public causes including education, medicine, the arts and the environment, concentrated her giving in Maine, responding to virtually any cause, charity or public institution in the state that needed money.
Among other things, she built a golf course for the town of Bremen, gave lavishly to the Portland Museum of Art, the Maine Maritime Museum and the University of Maine. When the Cumberland County Civic Center was so pressed for cash that it was looking for a corporate sponsor that would give it money in exchange for the right to give the center its name, Mrs. Noyce came through with a $1.3 million donation that allowed the center to retain its identity.
But for all the acclaim Mrs. Noyce received for her direct philanthropy, including the $15 million in endowments for charitable trusts that make independent grants to Maine charities, Mrs. Noyce gained even more applause when she began pioneering what she called "catalytic philanthropy," investments designed to bolster the state's economy.
In 1991, for example, when out-of-state financial institutions were picking off Maine's banks one by one and it appeared that Maine businesses and other borrowers would soon be at the mercy of distant lenders, Mrs. Noyce blithely created a brand new bank, the Maine Bank and Trust Company with an initial $7.7 million investment that eventually grew to some $14 million.
What made such "philanthropy," especially appealing became apparent when the bank prospered. Mr. Wells, who advised Mrs. Noyce on her investments, estimated yesterday that the bank was now worth at least twice what she paid for it.
During a lull in Maine's construction industry, Mrs. Noyce built five homes to provide jobs for construction workers, and when Maine's leading bakery was threatened with a takeover by a company that intended to move it out of state, Mrs. Noyce came to the rescue, buying the bakery and saving its 1,200 jobs.
Recently Mrs. Noyce had turned her attention to Portland's deteriorating downtown, going on a buying spree in which she acquired about 10 percent of the city's office and retail space. The rehabilitation effort attracted L. L. Bean and other tenants.
Although her efforts won wide praise, there were some rumblings that Mrs. Noyce was becoming too big a factor in the Portland economy and she had recently announced that she had no further designs on downtown property.
For all her wealth, Mrs. Noyce lived fairly simply, shunning the usual trappings of wealth and even driving her own car, most recently a Cadillac, to be sure, but only, she told her friends, because after a wreck in her smaller Oldsmobile, she felt more secure in a larger car.
Although she was always appropriately dressed, Mrs. Noyce had no interest in fashion and even less in travel, preferring to stay in Maine rather than visit the world's resorts.
Not that she was above the occasional indulgence. When she found that the steep driveway to her house became dangerously slick with wintertime ice, she built a more accessible winter home a thousand feet away.
Her only real material weakness stemmed from her love of the water, but it was a tribute to her reputation for innovative "catalytic philanthropy," that when she indulged her passion by commissioning a multimillion-dollar 60-foot yacht a few years ago, the acquisition was not viewed in Maine as an example of conspicuous consumption. Instead the purchase was trumpeted in the Maine press as a rescue of Maine's boat-building industry.
In recent months Mrs. Noyce had apparently developed renewed concern about the state's beleaguered boat builders. She had commissioned a 90-foot yacht.
Mrs. Noyce is survived by a son, William, of Hollis, N.H.; three daughters, Pendred of Weston, Mass.; Priscilla, of Kenya and Margaret, of Montana; two brothers, Frank Bottomley of Ohio and Bruce, of New Hampshire; a sister, Frances Broomhead of Rhode Island, and 13 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Simpson-Case Fatigue Mixes With Obsession

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 19

 BODY:
As jury selection began this week in the civil-suit sequel to the murder trial of the decade, the prospect of another national spell of obsession with O. J. Simpson was bringing a sigh from many a resistant viewer, reader and coffee-shop debater across the nation: "Not again."
"It should have been over the first time," said Richard Hahn, who owns the Animal Kingdom pet shop just around the corner from the Santa Monica courthouse where the trial of wrongful-death lawsuits against Mr. Simpson is expected to last at least four months. 
 Penny Jeffries, a retail clerk in Nashville, protested: "We are O.J.'d out."
Even Mary Stanley of the Los Angeles-area town of Downey, a supporter of Mr. Simpson who attended his criminal trial regularly, said that as she got up to catch the 5 A.M. bus to Santa Monica on Tuesday, she found herself muttering: "Oh, God, here it is again. I went through this for over a year. Can I do this again?"
Still, like reluctant soap-opera addicts, people in interviews around the nation said by and large that they would follow the case, particularly the testimony of Mr. Simpson himself, who never took the witness stand at the criminal trial. That trial ended last October in his acquittal of the murders of his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald L. Goldman, both of whose families have brought the civil suits.
"I'm interested in the trial, because what wasn't said in the criminal hearing may be said this time when O. J. takes the stand," said Ronald Fisher, a 33-year-old resident of the Bronx. "I'm a black American, but I think he was guilty. I think his money acquitted him."
Outside the Santa Monica courthouse, the great white mushrooms of television-truck satellite dishes have sprouted, and the reporters conduct their lawn interviews. But a been-here, done-this kind of of enervating deja vu seems to have taken hold, the enthusiasm among the news-media representatives not nearly what it was the first time around. (Jamie DeMatoff, a T-shirt entrepreneur, said sales to the press of his "Camp O. J. II -- The Sequel" edition were not going well at all.)
To a large extent, of course, it was live television coverage that drove public interest in the first trial. That is absent this time, cameras barred from the courtroom by the judge in the civil case, Hiroshi Fujisaki. And Jerianne Hayslett, the spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Superior Court, confirmed that media interest this time was not "as rabid" as it was during the criminal trial and certainly nothing like the peak of last Oct. 3, when some 2,000 members of news organizations were on hand at the courthouse in downtown Los Angeles for the verdicts.
For all of that, the American news media, like Americans as a whole, have hardly abandoned the O. J. case.
Ms. Hayslett, for instance, said news organizations' interest in the civil trial was certainly far higher than run of the mill, with 72 of them having applied for seats in the courtroom.
And those networks that went all out in their coverage of the criminal trial, like CNN and Court TV, are ready to respond this time as well to a public fascination that just will not die. Both those networks will provide frequent updates throughout the day, and Court TV will feature a daily half-hour report called "Families v. Simpson."
Steven Brill, the founder and chief executive of Court TV, compared interest in the Simpson case to rubbernecking at a car accident. "You watch it," he said, "but you don't feel great about yourself about watching it."
Americans tend to be in denial about their interest in the case, said Jeffrey Toobin, the author of the latest Simpson-trial book, "The Run of His Life," which, in the week after its release on Sept. 9 by Random House, climbed immediately to No. 2 on the New York Times best-seller list. As he travels the country on his book tour, Mr. Toobin said, he has found that "the passions have only grown more intense."
"What people would always say to me -- and still do, to a certain extent -- is, 'Oh, I don't follow it anymore,' " he said. "And then they'd cite an extremely recent fact that shows they've been following it very closely. It just combines everything that obsesses the American people: sex, race, violence, celebrity, sports."
Those elements have inspired an assortment of professional and amateur authors to create more than 50 books and audiotapes about the murders. Still more are expected, with the planned publication of books by some of the principals in the criminal trial, including the chief defense lawyer, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., and the lead prosecutor, Marcia Clark, who has been attacked by many authors, Mr. Toobin among them, for poor prosecutorial judgment but who obtained the highest advance, more than $4 million.
Mr. Simpson would seem to be the most likely author to cash in on the cottage industry. And indeed his "I Want to Tell You" (Little, Brown), written while he was jailed during the criminal trial, earned him hundreds of thousands of dollars.
But his efforts to win a contract for a follow-up book failed to attract a publisher, partly because his popularity was so low, partly because his asking price was more than $2 million. "That was a very strong investment for something that people felt was of very dubious commercial value," said one publishing executive, who insisted on anonymity.
There was little news emerging from the courthouse in the last two days, as the first group of potential jurors were questioned as to whether serving on the case would pose a special hardship.
But in some last pretrial rulings, Judge Fujisaki ordered a special hearing on whether evidence of blood on Mr. Simpson's shower and air-conditioner could be admitted. The judge also decreed that grisly autopsy photographs of the murder victims would remain sealed but that other photographs, of the crime scene itself, could be introduced.
Jury selection is expected to take several days. Mr. Simpson wanted to be present for it but will now apparently be preoccupied at a courthouse in nearby Orange County, where he is battling with the parents of his late wife for custody of their two children.
Around the nation, people who watched the criminal trial and said they would be following the civil proceedings closely also said they were hoping it would yield new clues that would answer questions left unresolved.
Jerry Flores, a parking valet in downtown Los Angeles, said he was waiting to find out "why did O. J. run during the car chase."
"If he is not guilty," Mr. Flores said, "why didn't he stay?"
John L. Adams, a motor-pool manager who works nearby, said he wanted to know how Mr. Simpson cut his finger, and what was in the bag that he carried to the airport on his way to Chicago the night of the murders.
In many cases, however, it is anger, not curiosity, that seems to be driving interest.
As she sat on a bench on Broadway in New York City, Elsa Acosta, 23 and unemployed, said she would read all about the civil trial for just one reason: "I want to see him made guilty, because I think he did it. He's aggressive, and he took it out on his wife. He has to face it."
Equally vehement were those who believe Mr. Simpson innocent: "They just need to leave him alone," said Gregory Davis, 19, a student at Tennessee State University in Nashville. "He's already been tried."
Even people who said they would not follow the proceedings expressed strongly held opinions about the case. Kent Wood, a securities analyst in Wichita, Kan., who said he was far more interested in the Presidential campaign than in Mr. Simpson's travails, could not resist adding: "O. J. Simpson should be in jail. Period."

Sumitomo Estimate of Loss Grows in Copper Scandal
Sumitomo said the losses incurred by Yasuo Hamanaka, its former chief copper trader, had increased to $2.6 billion, $800 million higher than earlier, and that it would request that criminal charges be filed against him.
Much uncertainty remained, but Sumitomo seemed to be trying to put the scandal behind it, giving few details of how the trader could have hidden such losses or whether others might have cooperated with him. [Page D3.]

HEADLINE: Clinton Errs in Designating Utah Monument

 BODY:
To the Editor:
President Clinton's unilateral action to designate 1.8 million acres in Utah as a new national monument can only be viewed as election-year politics (editorial, Sept. 18, and news article, Sept. 19). In creating the Canyons of the Escalante National Monument, he ignored the professional input of the Bureau of Land Management, which is charged with evaluating wilderness suitability, and he has withdrawn a significant domestic reserve of high-quality coal.
The Kaiparowits Plateau, part of the land included in the President's designation, is among the nation's richest coal fields, with an estimated 65 billion tons of high-quality coal. Currently, two-thirds of the nation's 640 million acres of public lands are off-limits to mining. This means that the mineral potential of this land will never be realized. 
 President Clinton is adding to this unrealized mineral potential, apparently without concern for the economic health of the local, state and Federal governments that would benefit from the development of the plateau.
His action comes as renewed tension in the Middle East highlights the importance of scarce and dependable American energy supplies. From the oil embargo of the early 1970's through the Persian Gulf war, Americans have learned what happens when our nation becomes dependent upon a foreign source of energy. We should not permit politics to create future gulf wars for the young men and women of our armed forces.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE RUNNING MATE;
Kemp Accuses the President of Lacking Strategy to Deal With Inner City

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, Sept. 19

 BODY:
Trying to undercut one of the Democrats' political pillars, Jack Kemp today attacked President Clinton's urban policies.
At the same time Mr. Kemp, the Republican Vice-Presidential candidate, released a confidential Clinton Administration memorandum in which the Housing Secretary pleaded with the White House for action on inner-city problems and warned of potentially dire political consequences if they were not addressed. 
 "Everywhere I go, I hear the same thing: Bill Clinton has abandoned the inner cities," Mr. Kemp told a sparsely attended rally at a public housing complex near downtown Memphis. "He has no urban strategy."
Memphis was the first stop on Mr. Kemp's two-day swing through Tennessee, one of the make-or-break Southern states for the Republican Presidential ticket and the home of Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Kemp appeared to have both factors on his mind in his appearance here.
"Bill Clinton's plan for the urban poor is to continue to promote dependence on a failed welfare system," Mr. Kemp said. "He does not have faith in their potential to do better than welfare; therefore, he has not worked to provide opportunities for the poor to rise from poverty. The Republican Party forced him to sign a welfare bill he did not believe in, and he has already pledged to dismantle the reforms if he is re-elected."
After Mr. Kemp spoke, his aides gave reporters copies of a year-old confidential Administration memorandum from Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
In the memorandum to Mr. Clinton, dated Aug. 9, 1995, Mr. Cisneros asked the President to develop immediately a cohesive "Presidential strategy" to deal with urban problems.
"The cities are hurting badly," Mr. Cisneros wrote, "and as a nation we'll pay the consequences for many years; we are running out of time; there is always room in the budget for Presidential priorities of reasonable size, and we do not have enough to stand on in the cities."
In his direst advice, the Secretary wrote, "We can be caught flat-footed by the violent outbreaks which will stem from the anger in the cities."
Mr. Cisneros noted that in the summer of 1995 there had already been "contained outbreaks of civil unrest" in Indianapolis, in the Coconut Grove area of Miami and in Los Angeles.
Mr. Cisneros recommended a number of strategies, including public and private investment in cities, community development banks and a network of "empowerment" schools.
In a telephone conference call with reporters, Mr. Cisneros dismissed Mr. Kemp's release of the memo as politically motivated. But more to the point, he added, virtually all of the ideas he proposed to the President have since been pursued by the Administration, from Mr. Clinton's proposal for new tax credits for employers who hire former welfare recipients, to a cleanup of polluted sites in urban areas to the expansion of community development banks.
"Most of the pieces have been addressed in one form or another," Mr. Cisneros said. "His implication is that we've not done enough. The story of the last several years has been our effort to address problems in communities across America."
Mr. Kemp's campaign aides would not say how they obtained the memorandum, only that they had had it for "some time" and had waited for an opportune moment to use it.
They saw that chance today as Mr. Kemp visited the public housing development. Not many development residents attended the rally, but the site served the Republican campaign's purpose of throwing down a new challenge to the Democrats on their own turf.
"The timing was to come to Al Gore's home state and talk about the status quo two days after he did," said Wayne Berman, the political director for Mr. Kemp.
In his speech, Mr. Kemp pledged that Bob Dole as President would drop all capital gains taxes on investments in inner cities and promote private ownership of public housing units.
"We need a radical, audacious, positive, constructive, bleeding-heart war against poverty and unemployment," Mr. Kemp said.
He did not mention the 15 percent across-the-board tax cut that is at the center of the Republican ticket's economic program, nor did he dwell long on crime and drugs, the issue the ticket began emphasizing this week.
Mr. Cisneros accused Mr. Kemp of "running from his own record and the Bush Administration's record in the four years that they had a chance to do these jobs," and failed to deliver on Mr. Kemp's ideas for creating so-called "enterprise zones" in which Federal tax incentives would be used to spur urban investment. He noted that it was left for Mr. Clinton to successfully press in 1993 for passage of a program to create "empowerment zones" along the same lines in cities and rural areas, and the President has now proposed expanding that program.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Little Changed Ahead of Fed Policy Session

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly higher yesterday as dealers and traders squared positions ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting next week to consider interest rates.
The 30-year bond rose 1/32 , to a price of 9613/32 to yield 7.04 percent, unchanged from Thursday. In the bond futures market the limited activity yesterday was mostly driven by the expiration of the October options contracts. 
 The credit market remained focused on next week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making panel. Since the market is deeply divided on what the policy decision will be, prices of government securities stayed in a narrow trading range for most of the day and are expected to do so until the panel meets on Tuesday.
Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York, said the market was definitely waiting on the Fed. "While I think it will be a close call," he said, "we expect they will hold monetary policy steady. With inflation very low and economic signals showing the economy is moderating, the Fed can afford to wait to see if their expectations of slower growth materialize."
Mr. Palash said market prices improved in the afternoon, after the expiration of options.
In when-issued trading for notes to be auctioned next week, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.25 percent and the five-year note at 6.61 percent.
Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber, said that after reviewing most of the August economic data, he was trimming his estimate of third-quarter growth in gross domestic product to 2.3 percent from 3 percent.
"These slow-growth forecasts," he said, "follow the rapid 4.8 percent real growth in the second quarter and are critical to our thinking that the Federal Reserve System should not be raising short-term interest rates at any of the F.O.M.C. meetings this year."

Seemly Vs. Sexy On Screen

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
"Sex and the Silver Screen" is a six-hour account of the decades-long battle between permissiveness and censuriousness, or between prurience and primness, or between the artist and the bluestocking, or between the exploiter and the upholder of standards. However described, it is generous with flesh-and-frolic scenes from movies that were greeted with finger-shaking by some and lip-licking by others.
The hourlong segments are presented backward in time, permitting the producers to lead off with the most explicit excerpts and the most recognizable stars. Since the doings on screen are connected to changes in society at large, going in reverse seems perverse, which is not altogether inappropriate. 
 Anyhow, the somewhat simplistic theme is the conflict between movie makers intent on opening things up and censors determined to shut them down. From the beginning, of course, Hollywood has been driven less by such edifying concepts as free speech or art than by good old box-office considerations. As in some of the movies on show, the focus has always been on the bottom line.
In Sunday's two-hour opener, you can see excerpts from such works as "Last Tango in Paris," "Deep Throat," "Basic Instinct," "Blow Up," "Lolita" and "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls," which was directed by Russ Meyer, that pioneer of the flesh flick who declared, "I deal in big bosoms and square jaws." The series continues its backward journey weekly on Fridays until it reaches pre-talkie times.
The courts, as noted here, have upheld the cause of screen sex despite pressures to suppress, and Frank Martin, the series writer and director, is on the side of the First Amendment. Raquel Welch, our host, may be forgiven for her stiff delivery of such vapidities as, "The most satisfying form of creative stimulation begins first in the heart and finds its way from there." But she looks good enough to stimulate at least half the audience, which is what "Sex and the Silver Screen" is mainly about.
 
'Democracy in America '96'
'Downsizing the Dream?'
CNN, Sunday night at 9
This well-reported look at the nation's economic condition contrasts cutbacks by A.T. & T. and the hard times of union workers locked out of a trailer factory in Charleston, Ill., with the high times of the growing information industry in lower Manhattan and the resurgence of Pittsburgh from rust-belt blues to high-tech hopefulness.
 
'Jobs'
'The Class of 2000'
PBS, Sunday night at 7
(Channel 13 in New York)
And speaking of the up side of downsizing, this documentary, which is as boring as it is worthy, tells of community programs that are readying young men and women for solid jobs. A 20-year-old man in Tulsa, Okla., is on his way to becoming a machinist; a single mother in Boston will soon be a radiation therapist, and an apprentice journalist in Pittsburgh just got her first byline. We know what that feels like, Joanna.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up Modestly in Advance Of European and Fed Meetings

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar was moderately higher against major currencies yesterday as traders squared their books before the European finance ministers meeting this weekend in Dublin and the Federal Reserve's session on Tuesday.
The talks at Dublin Castle, which start in earnest today, were seen as essential for keeping considerable political momentum behind starting a single European currency in January 1999. 
 The meeting comes amid an intense scramble by European Union Governments led by Germany and France to bring their 1997 budget deficits in line with the Maastricht Treaty criteria for economic and monetary union.
Some currency traders were optimistic that the talks would yield progress. As a result, the German mark weakened against the dollar and other European currencies because the mark would become less important as a safe-haven currency if monetary union came into being.
"As time goes on, it seems like the countries seem to be determined to try and get their budgetary matters in accord with Maastricht targets," Tom Benfer, director of foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal, said.
"So people feel the convergence is going to happen eventually. So that's why the mark was sold off in overnight trading." The French franc had soared to a two-month high against the mark yesterday, but the German currency cut its losses against the franc and other currencies in New York.
In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.5155 marks, up from 1.5132 late on Thursday. The dollar traded at 109.80 Japanese yen, up from 109.40.
Speculation about whether the Fed would raise interest rates Tuesday to head off any inflationary pressures has also preoccupied the foreign exchange market. Higher rates tend to help the dollar by making dollar-denominated assets more attractive to foreign investors.
By yesterday, currency traders had largely priced into dollar exchange rates the possibility that the Fed may increase rates by one-quarter percentage point, traders said.
In other trading, the British pound rose moderately to $1.5550 yesterday from $1.5520 on Thursday. The dollar fell to $1.3668 (Canadian) from $1.3704.

Deal on Mental Health May Affect Employers
Experts on employee benefits said Congress's decision to expand health insurance coverage for the mentally ill would prompt tens of thousands of businesses to redesign their employee health benefits in ways that go far beyond what is required by Congress. Employers, even big companies like Xerox and Hewlett-Packard, said they feared that the new requirements would substantially increase their costs. [Page 1.]
 
Stocks Rise But Dow Misses Record
Stocks were mostly higher, lifting some measures to record highs, but the buying was restrained with many investors awaiting next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting on interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.72 points, to 5,888.46, closing less than a point from Monday's record close of 5,889.20. The Nasdaq composite index rose for the 11th consecutive session, led again by technology issues. [34.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities rose as dealers and traders squared positions ahead of the Fed's meeting. The yield on the 30-year bond was unchanged at 7.04 percent. [34.]
 
Archer Daniels Sues Executive Archer Daniels Midland has sued Mark E. Whitacre, the former company executive who served as an informant for the Government, accusing him of embezzling millions of dollars from the company over several years. Mr. Whitacre, who secretly tape-recorded meetings as part of a price-fixing investigation of Archer Daniels, was dismissed from the company last year amid allegations of embezzlement. He has acknowledged obtaining the money in overseas bank accounts. But he has said that he obtained it as part of a secret plan intended to allow executives to avoid taxes; Archer Daniels denies that allegation. [43.]
 
Blue Cross Questions Deal
The national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association suggested that Ohio Blue Cross and Blue Shield was not getting full value for the main business lines that it has agreed to sell to the Columbia-HCA Healthcare Corporation for $299.5 million. [43.]
 
Time Warner in Feud With Fox
Time Warner's cable television company has decided to offer NBC's new news channel and not one being started by Rupert Murdoch's Fox Inc., enraging Fox executives, who accused the Time Warner chairman, Gerald Levin, of breaking a fully negotiated agreement. One Fox executive said that Mr. Murdoch was so angry over the decision that Fox may retaliate. [21.]
 
F.T.C. Drops Publishing Case
Seventeen years after starting an antitrust investigation, the Federal Trade Commission quietly closed a case involving six of the largest book publishers without deciding if they ever discriminated against independent bookstores by selling discounted books to major chains. Voting 3 to 1 to end the antitrust review, the commission released a statement explaining that it was better to terminate the case because it did not appear to be a "prudent use of scarce public resources." [32.]
 
Funeral Home Rivals Fight
The shooting began between the two largest funeral home chains in the country after the Service Corporation, which is seeking to buy the Loewen Group, said its rival had overpaid when it spent $240 million to buy the nation's largest cemetery and funeral home. [32.]
 
Dollar Rises Slightly
The dollar was moderately higher against major currencies as traders squared their books before the European finance ministers' meeting this weekend in Dublin and the Fed's session on Tuesday. In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.5155 marks, up from 1.5132 on Thursday. The dollar traded at 109.80 Japanese yen, up from 109.40. [33.]

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Off on Possible I.M.F. Sale Of Supply to Aid Poor Countries

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Gold prices fell yesterday on the Comex Division of the New York Mercantile Exchange amid concern that the International Monetary Fund would officially announce a plan to sell five million ounces of gold to help pay debts of the world's poorest countries.
On other markets, copper fell while soybeans rose. 
 "There is some concern over a possible announcement from the I.M.F. on their proposed sale," said Don Tierney, analyst with Pell Brothers Trading. "They're meeting today and again tomorrow."
Gold for December delivery fell $1.70, to $383.90 an ounce. December silver plunged 7.7 cents, to $4.863 an ounce, dropping 4.6 percent in two days.
Gold's failure to respond to the conflict in Iraq and the surge in oil prices past $25 a barrel to a five-month high is reducing demand from investors.
"It doesn't look good," said Jeff Singer, gold trader with Imperial Bank in Los Angeles. "We've just been through a mini oil crisis. If gold can't respond to that, what is it going to take?"
Copper fell 2.6 percent after stockpiles did not fall enough to offset concern over rising mine output.
While the London Metal Exchange said its copper inventories fell by 2,900 tons since Tuesday to 265,450 tons, dropping 3.5 percent so far this month, traders were focusing on increased supply next year from new mines in Chile. December copper fell 2.4 cents, to 87.80 cents a pound, on the Comex.
Soybeans rose for the first time in three days amid forecasts that cold temperatures could damage crops. The Weather Services Corporation said temperatures were likely to drop as low as 30 degrees Fahrenheit early next week in Minnesota and northern Iowa.
The crop, which was delayed in planting this year by heavy rains, is about two weeks behind development, with most areas harvested during October. A freeze now would be just 10 days ahead of normal.
"The ongoing fear of frost is going to be supportive for prices whether it materializes or not," said Dale Durchholz, analyst at Agrivisor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.
November soybeans rose 6 cents, to $7.9525 a bushel, at the Chicago Board of Trade.

HEADLINE: Lewis Replaces Primis as President of Times Co.

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The New York Times Company announced yesterday that its 50-year-old president and chief operating officer, Lance R. Primis, had resigned. He will be replaced by Russell T. Lewis, the president and general manager of The New York Times newspaper.
Industry analysts and one executive of the Times Company said that Mr. Primis's unexpected resignation was prompted by Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the chairman and chief executive of the company. The chairman, they say, was apparently unwilling to offer Mr. Primis any assurances that he might one day succeed Mr. Sulzberger as chief executive. 
 Clearly, they added, the relationship between the two men was not working as smoothly as Mr. Sulzberger had hoped when Mr. Primis became president four years ago.
"Punch Sulzberger is chairman of this company, and he is going to be for some time -- and it's years, though I don't know if it's 2, 5 or 10" years, said Diane Baker, the company's chief financial officer. "Lance did a terrific job. But the partnership between them did not jell in a way that Punch felt was going to work in the long term."
Ms. Baker insisted that the departure of Mr. Primis would not alter the business strategy of the company.
In a statement, Mr. Sulzberger said, "The addition of Russ Lewis to the corporate team will assist the company in achieving its current strategy, which is to invest in its core businesses, increase holdings in traditional and new media and focus on both re-engineering and revenue building."
Most Wall Street analysts said they expected the company's strategy to remain intact. Douglas Arthur of Morgan Stanley & Company said that he expected the company's share price to drop somewhat because of the surprise resignation.
But Mr. Arthur said he was continuing to recommend the company's stock because of signs that the New York City economy was coming out of a seven-year slump and because the Times management had done a good job in controlling costs, which should allow profits to rise as advertising picks up. Mr. Primis's departure, he said, "doesn't change the story."
Class A shares of the Times Company fell 62.5 cents yesterday, to $32.
Like other analysts, John Reidy of Smith Barney Inc. noted that control of the company had rested with the Sulzberger and Ochs families for a century. "This is a 100-year-old, family-run franchise, and it just isn't going to revolve around one person, especially someone from outside the family," Mr. Reidy said.
In his statement, Mr. Sulzberger said, "Lance wanted to be free to seek a more certain opportunity to run an enterprise and thought it would be appropriate to relinquish his responsibilities."
Mr. Primis, who started at the company in 1969 answering telephones in the paper's classified advertising department and rose through the ranks, will remain as a consultant until the end of the year.
Mr. Primis did not answer telephone calls and electronic mail messages seeking comment yesterday.
Analysts said the resignation appeared to increase the likelihood that Mr. Sulzberger would someday be succeeded by his son, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the 44-year-old publisher of The New York Times.
"Arthur Jr. is now more clearly the heir apparent to be the chairman of the company as a whole," said John Morton, an analyst with Lynch Jones & Ryan Inc. in Washington.
But there is no timetable for any succession. Mr. Sulzberger, the 70-year-old chairman, has "no plans to retire," said Nancy Nielsen, a company spokeswoman.
As the new president of the company, Mr. Lewis, 49, will oversee the operations of not only its flagship newspaper, but also The Boston Globe, 21 smaller newspapers, 9 magazines including Golf Digest and Tennis, 8 television stations and 2 radio stations.
Mr. Lewis joined The Times as a copy boy in 1966 while attending the State University of New York at Stony Brook. He became a news clerk and then a news assistant, a role that included handling local reporting assignments. After earning a law degree, he became a lawyer for Cahill, Gordon & Reindel, before rejoining The Times as a staff lawyer in 1977. During his years as the head of production, from 1988 to 1992, he streamlined the operations to curb labor costs significantly, analysts said.
Since 1993, Mr. Lewis has been president and general manager of The Times newspaper. Analysts say he has helped lead the effort to raise advertising and circulation revenues with aggressive pricing, while curbing costs. In the first six months of 1996, they note, advertising revenue increased 8 percent and circulation revenues rose nearly 15 percent.
"They are getting decent numbers despite a sluggish advertising environment in New York City and the Northeast in general," Mr. Reidy of Smith Barney said.
Mr. Lewis helped plan and manage the construction of a new color printing plant in College Point, Queens, which is expected to open in mid-1997. Once the plant is in operation, The Times will be able to print in color and place advertising inserts in its daily editions, which should increase advertising revenue.
In his statement, Mr. Sulzberger praised the performance of the newspaper's management team, his son and Mr. Lewis. "Under Arthur's and Russ's leadership," Mr. Sulzberger said, "The Times has significantly increased its operating revenues, national circulation and profitability while the paper has continued to maintain the highest journalistic standards."
At the newspaper, Mr. Lewis will be replaced as president by Janet L. Robinson, who has been senior vice president for advertising. Ms. Robinson, 46, had previously been senior vice president for sales and marketing of the company's women's magazine group, which was sold in 1994. Before joining the company, Ms. Robinson was a public school teacher and reading specialist for 11 years.
She will be succeeded as senior vice president for advertising by Daniel H. Cohen, who had been vice president for advertising. Mr. Cohen, who is 44, had previously held a variety of positions in corporate planning, circulation and advertising. Before joining The Times, he was a program director for Warner Amex Cable in Dallas and had worked as a television cameraman in Orlando, Fla. He is the son of the company chairman's sister, Judith P. Sulzberger, a director of the company.
Mr. Sulzberger Jr. said of Ms. Robinson: "Under her skillful leadership, advertising revenues have increased significantly in a challenging market. Since joining the company, she has demonstrated a strong commitment to our financial success, and I know she will bring that same energy and drive to her new position."

HEADLINE: EXPERTS FORESEE HEALTH PLAN SHIFT FOR MENTAL CARE

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20

 BODY:
Experts on employee benefits said today that Congress's decision to expand health insurance coverage for the mentally ill would prompt tens of thousands of businesses to revise their health plans in ways that go far beyond what is required by Congress.
Employers, including big companies like Xerox and Hewlett-Packard, said they feared that the new requirements would substantially increase their costs. But others said the costs would be manageable. 
 James A. Klein, the executive director of the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans, a trade group of mostly Fortune 500 companies, said: "Employers are likely to reduce other valuable benefits in order to accommodate the cost of the new mandates. If some specific benefits are required, different benefits valued by other workers will be sacrificed to pay for them."
Martha Priddy Patterson, the director of employee-benefits policy at KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm, said, "Some employers will look at these requirements and decide that it's too expensive for them to begin or continue providing health benefits."
Congressional leaders announced on Thursday that they had agreed on legislation to curb disparities in insurance coverage for mental and physical illnesses. Under the proposal, if a group health plan offers any mental health benefits, it may not impose more restrictive annual or lifetime limits on spending for mental illness than on coverage of physical ailments.
All group health plans offering mental health benefits and serving more than 50 employees would be subject to these requirements in January 1998. In later years, a health plan may obtain an exemption if it can prove that its premiums increased by 1 percent or more as a result of the mandate.
Employee-benefits experts said many companies would re-evaluate their benefit programs in the light of the legislation. Employers could drop mental health coverage altogether, set higher co-payments or deductibles or make other changes to control or offset the new costs.
"Employers will take a new and fresh look at mental health benefits," said Ronald E. Bachman of Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm. "They won't just say, 'Let me tinker with my benefits to be sure I'm in compliance with the new law.' "
The new costs, Mr. Bachman said, "will be insignificant," well under 1 percent of premiums.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that premiums in a typical fee-for-service plan would rise four-tenths of 1 percent. But the agency said employers, over all, would offset more than half of this cost by dropping health insurance coverage altogether, by dropping or reducing coverage for mental health services or by dropping other benefits.
Advocates for the mentally ill said few companies would experience an increase in costs of more than 1 percent. But Susan D. Moriconi, health benefits manager for Hewlett-Packard, said: "They're absolutely, positively wrong on that. A large number of employers and plans will have an increase of more than 1 percent."
Mr. Klein, of the pension trade group, predicted that some employers would increase co-payments and deductibles, for all services or just for mental health services, to offset the new costs.
"The vast majority of employees who have mental health services," he said, "will pay more to help the very few who would otherwise hit the annual limit."
The requirements for mental health coverage were added to an appropriations bill that will probably be approved by Congress next week. President Clinton strongly supports the requirements, so they are expected to become law.
The requirements will probably increase the demand for health maintenance organizations and other health plans that control costs by managing care, especially mental health care. In the last few years, an industry has sprung up to provide mental health services at predictable costs, by monitoring the work of psychiatrists and psychologists and other mental health professionals.
James E. Buckley, senior partner in charge of health care consulting at KPMG Peat Marwick, said: "The impact of this legislation will be to encourage employers to make greater use of managed care. It becomes more of an economic necessity. Otherwise, it's difficult to control inpatient mental health expenditures."
Mr. Bachman, an actuary at Coopers & Lybrand, said, "The market will respond in new and creative ways to provide flexibility in plan design and to meet employees' needs while making sure that mental health costs don't get out of hand."
Employers will still be allowed to set limits on the number of outpatient visits or hospital days for which they will pay. Mr. Bachman said employers might revise mental health benefits to create options for employees, giving them more visits with psychotherapists if they accepted fewer days of hospital care.
Hewlett-Packard now has a lifetime limit of $1 million on health benefits for any employee or dependent, with a separate limit of $300,000 on mental health care.
Ms. Moriconi said she did not know how the company would revise its plan to comply with the Federal requirements. But she said: "I can't imagine proposing any reduction in the $1 million lifetime limit. That would send a very negative message to employees." At the same time, she said, it will be difficult to increase monthly premiums or co-payments because employees are "very sensitive" to such costs.
Many companies have a lifetime limit of $50,000 on mental health coverage, with a much higher limit of $750,000 to $1 million on coverage of physical ailments. Mr. Bachman said these companies could comply with the new requirements by setting a single lifetime limit of $1 million for medical, surgical and mental health benefits combined.
E. Clarke Ross, the executive director of the American Managed Behavioral Healthcare Association, a trade group, said few people used more than $50,000 of mental health benefits in a lifetime. Thus, Mr. Ross said, the precedent of the new legislation will be more important than its direct, immediate effects.
"A precedent has been established that you cannot discriminate on the basis of mental illness," he said, and that precedent can be used to eliminate other disparities in the coverage of mental and physical illness.
Helen Darling, manager of health programs at Xerox, said: "Xerox and the business community have strongly resisted mandated benefits of this type. Congress, as usual, is heavily regulating the good guys, the people who voluntarily provide benefits, even as millions of Americans still get no health benefits from their employers."
Ms. Darling said she feared that the new requirements would lead to "an explosion of costs" like the one Xerox experienced several years ago when it increased coverage of outpatient mental health care.
Xerox later imposed limits on mental health benefits to control such costs, Ms. Darling said.

HEADLINE: Honesty in Banking

 BODY:
House and Senate negotiators will decide soon whether to gut an important protection for bank customers. The 1991 Truth in Savings Act requires banks to advertise yields on deposit accounts in identical fashion so that customers can instantly compare one bank's offering with another. The provision forces banks to compete honestly for customers by offering attractive interest rates. Consumers Union estimates that the law will be worth $300 million this year to depositors.
The proposed rollback is part of a larger bank bill designed to shore up the fund that insures deposits at savings and loan institutions. The fund is in trouble because it began charging savings institutions very high premiums after the huge bankruptcies of the 1980's. The high premiums, in turn, are driving many savings institutions to turn themselves into commercial banks, sapping the fund of cash. The bill would call on banks to help stabilize the fund -- a sensible first step in bringing savings institutions and banks, which are economically indistinguishable, under the same regulations. 
 To get banks to go along, however, politicians had to offer the sweetener of eliminating some regulations. Some rules are needlessly costly and deserve to be discarded. Truth in Savings is not one of them. Banks offer customers a bewildering variety of deposits. Few customers can easily calculate whether they would be better off with an account that pays 5 percent compounded each day or one that pays 5.4 percent compounded each month. The law requires banks to provide consumers with a simple yardstick called the "annual percentage yield," which takes account of both the interest rate and the formula the bank uses to compute interest payments.
Alfonse D'Amato, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and his Republican colleagues are debating whether to include the Truth in Savings rollback in the omnibus budget bill. Before they make that mistake, the White House should make clear that President Clinton will sign no spending bill that strips consumers of well-designed protections that keep banks honest.

HEADLINE: Turks, Opposing U.S., Urge Iraq To Take Control of Kurdish Area

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey, Sept. 20

 BODY:
Determined to crack down on Turkish Kurds who are waging a guerrilla war from camps in northern Iraq, Turkey is urging President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to impose his authority there.
This Turkish policy, which Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller described in an interview here today, marks a departure from the policy of the United States, which seeks to limit Mr. Hussein's power. 
 Mrs. Ciller insisted that Turkey, a NATO ally, would continue allowing American planes enforcing the "no flight" zone in northern Iraq to operate from a base in Turkey. But the emerging policy differences suggest that relations between the two nations may be entering a new and possibly difficult phase in the wake of the power shifts in northern Iraq.
Mrs. Ciller's remarks were greeted with dismay by senior Administration officials, who said they did not reflect what Turkey has told the United States in recent meetings.
Mr. Hussein's last attempt to assert authority in northern Iraq, which came three weeks ago when he sent troops there to support a local Kurdish faction's takeover of the region, led the United States to stage cruise missile attacks on military installations in southern Iraq.
Mrs. Ciller did not say whether Turkey wants Mr. Hussein to send his own troops into northern Iraq to crush Turkish Kurds who are fighting a separatist war from bases there. No other force in Iraq, however, including Mr. Hussein's new Kurdish allies, appears to have the military power to conduct such an operation.
If Mr. Hussein's army or another powerful military force were to conduct a major strike against Turkish separatist guerrillas in Iraq, the guerrillas would probably be forced to flee either into Turkey, where they would have to face the Turkish Army, or into neighboring Syria, where their leaders are based.
Mrs. Ciller said that if Mr. Hussein's army or some other force could chase the separatist guerrillas out of northern Iraq, Turkey would drop its plan to create a "security zone" inside Iraq.
"We have the problem that a terrorist group, the P.K.K., is operating from camps in northern Iraq," she said, referring to the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party. "An average of three Turkish soldiers are being killed every day by these terrorists. That is something we cannot tolerate, and to stop this infiltration, we proposed establishing a security zone in the border area."
"We have sent a delegation to Saddam to tell him that if he can impose central authority there, O.K.," she said in the interview, speaking in English.
"We are still talking to him, and we are interested to see what he can do or is prepared to do," she continued. "If he can establish a degree of rule there that puts an end to terrorist infiltration, that would be fine with us. If not, we will take measures to see that terrorists do not continue to operate on our borders. We defend the territorial integrity of Iraq, but the lack of authority there has been tragic for us."
Washington was clearly unhappy about Mrs. Ciller's comments.
"I have to say I'm a little surprised by those statements," a senior State Department official said. "This does not accord with the discussions the United States has had with Turkey. Perhaps it is Turkey's way of signaling to the United States that it has alternatives."
The official added that if it was true that Turkey was inviting Mr. Hussein to re-establish control over northern Iraq, "it would not be a welcome development -- it would obviously make our cooperation with the Turks more difficult."
But the official also said, "There is room to be uncertain about what different officials in Turkey really think."
Secretary of Defense William J. Perry met with Mrs. Ciller during his recent swing through the region, and she did not tell him of Turkey's intention to urge Mr. Hussein to re-assert his authority over the north. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to meet with her next week when they both attend the United Nations General Assembly.
For the last five years, Iraqi forces have been barred from the northern part of the country, where the United States and its allies established a haven for Kurds after the Persian Gulf war. But the Kurdish authorities in the enclave have proven unwilling or unable to close Kurdistan Workers Party camps there.
Last month one group of Iraqi Kurds formed an alliance with Mr. Hussein, and for the first time since 1991 Iraqi troops entered the Kurdish enclave. It is still unclear whether Mr. Hussein will assume full control of the region, but that prospect, while troubling to the United States, is encouraging to Turkey.
Mrs. Ciller's comments today underlined a fundamental difference between Turkish and American goals in Iraq. The United States seeks to limit Mr. Hussein's power and prevent him from disrupting the flow of oil from the Middle East to Western industrial nations.
Turkey's principal goals are to close Kurdistan Workers Party bases in Iraq by whatever means necessary and, if possible, to end the American-led economic boycott of Iraq, which has cost Turkey billions of dollars in lost trade.
On Thursday, the new Turkish Prime Minister, Necmettin Erbakan, broke three weeks of silence on the Iraqi crisis by asserting that he would be very happy if Kurds in northern Iraq were to reach an accord with Mr. Hussein.
"If this happens, the area would be cleared of the P.K.K.," Mr. Erbakan told reporters in Ankara. "It would be great."
Asked if he thought the United States would be pleased with a solution that would increase Mr. Hussein's power, Mr. Erbakan replied: "This is not our problem. We have no quarrel with any person in Baghdad. That is only the concern of the United States."
Mr. Erbakan is the first Turkish Prime Minister from an Islamic-based political movement, but his comments and those of Mrs. Ciller reflect a strong political consensus that reaches across the Turkish political spectrum. All mainstream political leaders here, evidently supported by public opinion, are eager to crush the Kurdish separatists and to rebuild Turkey's once-lucrative trading links with Iraq.
The leader of the Iraqi Kurdish faction that is now allied with Mr. Hussein, Massoud Barzani, visited Turkey this week for talks with Foreign Minister Ciller. She said today that Mr. Barzani was sympathetic to Turkey's demand for a crackdown on the Kurdistan Workers Party, which is known as the P.K.K.
"We told him that he would never get what he wants from Turkey if this situation continues," Mrs. Ciller said. "He said he and his people were against terrorism and against the P.K.K., and that P.K.K. operations against us from his territory were something he does not want."
Mrs. Ciller also said she was pleased at a crackdown on organizations in Western Europe that support the Kurdistan Workers Party this week. In an operation coordinated with Germany, Britain, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, more than 200 police officers in Belgium swooped down on the offices of a Kurdish-language television station that officials described as a "propaganda mouthpiece" of the Kurdistan Workers Party. More than 60 Kurds were reportedly detained for questioning.
Newspapers in Belgium reported that the police there believe that the Kurdish Workers Party is engaged in drug and arms smuggling, extortion and other crimes in Europe.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
Dole Offering Book on His Economic Plan

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: KNOXVILLE, Tenn., Sept. 20

 BODY:
Hoping to jump-start public interest in the centerpiece issue of their campaign, Bob Dole and Jack Kemp today released a book on their economic plan.
The book, entitled "Trusting the People," bills itself as "the Dole-Kemp plan to free the economy and create a better America." 
 Mr. Dole, the Republican Presidential candidate, and his running mate, Mr. Kemp, handed out the books today to reporters traveling with their campaigns and planned to mail hundreds more free copies.
Charles Black, a senior adviser to Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp, said he did not expect the book, which costs $15 and is published by HarperCollins, to produce brisk sales among the public. But he said, "We're going to get them out to opinion leaders."
Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp are listed as the authors of the book, and the cover features a picture of the smiling candidates that was taken the day Mr. Dole introduced Mr. Kemp as his running mate.
Campaign aides said they did not know how many books had been printed, and they could not say immediately how much the project had cost the campaign.
The flyleaf of the book touts it as "more than vague election-year promises."
"In common-sense, jargon-free language, Bob Dole and Jack Kemp walk you through the details of their plan to unshackle the American economy," the book promises.
In the book, the candidates use charts and graphs and large type to explain what their economic plan would mean to families and how they hoped to achieve their goals.
Mr. Dole has promised that if he is elected President, he will push for a 15 percent across-the-board tax cut for every taxpayer, a tax credit of $500 per child for "working families," a 50 percent cut in the tax rate for capital gains, an end to "overbearing" Federal regulations and an overhaul of the legal system.
He has also promised to balance the Federal budget by 2002, although the flyleaf of his book, in an apparent error, lists the target date as two years earlier.
The Republican economic plan has come under a withering attack from President Clinton and other Democrats and has been met by rampant skepticism by much of the public. So far, it has failed to take hold with voters.
Dole-Kemp campaign staff members acknowledged that they were borrowing an idea that their rival, Mr. Clinton, used in his 1992 run for the Presidency, when he summed up his main campaign themes in a book entitled, "Putting People First."
The Republicans released their book in advance of a countrywide push next week to put their economic plan back at the forefront of their campaign, which has focused on crime and drugs in the last week.
"It'll help us get the Dole plan out," said Mr. Black, the political adviser. "We have to defend our plan against the Democratic fog machine."

HEADLINE: THE FOREIGN POLICY RACE;
Bob Dole's Calculated Pragmatism

BYLINE: By Owen Harries; Owen Harries is the editor of The National Interest.

 BODY:
Until a few weeks ago, the vital question in this Presidential election campaign seemed to be whether it took a village to raise a child. Now we have another question: Why did it take Saddam Hussein to make American foreign policy an issue worthy of discussion in the campaign? Until he sent his troops north against the Kurds, the subject was being comprehensively ignored, and how the strongest country on earth should comport itself abroad was a nonissue.
To be fair to Bob Dole, this is not the way he had wanted it to be. Earlier this year, he was predicting that "America's global future will soon be an important issue in this election" and he went to the trouble of creating an elaborate network of consultants on foreign policy. So elaborate and inclusive is the network, indeed, that when Senator John McCain says that he is one of Bob Dole's 200 closest advisers, it appears less a joke than a simple statement of fact. McCain himself, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Donald Rumsfeld, Robert Ellsworth, Brent Scowcroft, Richard Lugar, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Armitage, Peter Rodman, Richard Perle, Robert Zoellick . . . and, it sometimes seems, virtually every Republican and conservative in Washington with any foreign policy credentials. 
 Dole also delivered a series of strong speeches on foreign policy in which he insisted that there are "vast and fundamental" differences between him and President Clinton. He relentlessly criticized the Administration's performance as incoherent, vacillating, scattershot, posturing and self-contradictory, and he found no difficulty providing examples to support his charges.
In the case of China, he assailed the Administration's inability to coordinate and prioritize policies on trade, human rights and geopolitics. In the case of Bosnia, he bemoaned the endless prevarication over intervention, the smoke and mirror "solution" at Dayton and the President's failure to keep a direct promise ("I give you my word") to arm and train the Bosnians. In the case of North Korea, he pointed to the President's solemn declaration that such a rogue state could not be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb, followed by an admission that it probably already possessed one, followed in turn by a generous grant of aid to an unrepentant Pyongyang. And so on.
These attacks clearly signaled Dole's desire to make foreign policy a campaign issue. But it soon became equally clear that the Clinton Administration was determined to decline the invitation. After every Dole speech, the White House immediately insisted that, rhetoric apart, there was really no significant difference between the two sides. This "smother defense" seems to have worked. In July, The New York Times editorialized that Dole was "finding it hard to pick a foreign policy fight" and perceived convergence between the two candidates on the subject.
Say such a thing to a Dole adviser and you get an indignant denial, but it is half true. No, there is not genuine convergence, but neither is there enough clear daylight between the two positions to make foreign policy contentious. In part, this is because the post-cold-war world is not amenable to the kind of grand, overarching ideas that simplify and give a sharp definition to events.
Dole's problem is compounded by what one may term either Clinton's skill at "triangulation" or his incredible policy promiscuity. President Clinton does not have a foreign policy. Rather, he has multiple and conflicting foreign policies, sometimes pursued in sequence, sometimes simultaneously. While this is not very good for the country, it makes it extremely hard for an opponent to find a fixed target or to come up with a policy to which Clinton cannot lay some claim. Is Dole for granting most-favored-nation status to China? Well, so in the end and after some bewildering wobbles and wanderings, is Clinton. Does Dole want a missile defense system? Well, so does Clinton sort of, sometime, to some extent.
Faced with such quick-change artistry, Dole is reduced to trying to differentiate himself convincingly from Clinton by focusing on general qualities like coherence, clarity and consistency. These are vitally important in a foreign policy but they lack political sex appeal. Whatever the combination of reasons, by August it looked as though Dole had bowed to the conventional wisdom that, barring some major international crisis, foreign policy does not count for much in Presidential elections. Now, events in Iraq, together with the farcical election in Bosnia, may help force the subject onto the campaign agenda.
If that happens, it will be long overdue. The seven-year failure by both parties to put together anything approximating a coherent post-cold-war foreign policy represents an extraordinary and unsatisfactory state of affairs. And on the evidence of his first four years on the job, there is every reason to doubt that a second-term President Clinton would, or could, do anything much to repair the omission. (To believe otherwise -- that with no more elections to contest he would suddenly put politics aside and start "playing it for history" -- is to ignore the compulsive behavior pattern of a lifetime.)
 WHAT, THEN, OF A PRESIDENT DOLE? WOULD he do any better? What would he bring to the shaping and running of American foreign policy?
Bob Dole is quintessentially a party man -- the Mr. Republican of his generation -- so it makes sense to consider his views in the context of the party he now leads. Republicans are as deeply divided on foreign policy as on domestic "values." Since the fall of the Soviet Union deprived them of an overriding unifying cause, two distinct and sharply opposing wings have emerged: the neoisolationists and the global crusaders.
The neoisolationists argue that the level of global involvement and commitment sustained during the cold war was abnormal and that it should now be reduced drastically and rapidly. Commitments abroad should be subject to the stringent test of national interest and priority should be given to urgent, long-neglected domestic matters. The main political support for this position comes from the party's right, and Patrick Buchanan has been its most forceful spokesman.
The global crusaders insist that, as the sole remaining superpower, the United States must now assume a "proactive," interventionist but benevolent leadership in world affairs. Both its power and its ideals demand that it maintain global order, oppose and end oppression and energetically promote democracy and human rights. American foreign policy must be informed by an inspiring vision, one that will serve not only to reshape the world but also to remoralize America itself. This position is advanced forcefully by neoconservatives like Joshua Muravchik, William Kristol and Robert Kagan.
Dole subscribes to neither of these limiting positions. He berates isolationists -- along with "declinists," multilateralists and protectionists -- as people who would "make a dangerous world even more so." That said, it is worth recalling that he spent his first 20 years growing up in Kansas, then a bastion of isolationism.
Thus, it is not entirely surprising that Dole now believes that "our cold war victory allows the United States to be more selective in its involvement around the world," that "hopes and desires should not be confused with United States interests, which are paramount," that the promotion of democracy abroad should not be seen as an absolute goal and that America's freedom of action must never be circumscribed by the need for multilateral consent.
While Dole clearly rejects the minimalism of the neoisolationists, he does share their concern with discrimination and imposing limits and their insistence that self-interest should provide the criterion for doing so. His relationship with the global crusaders is the other way around: he agrees with their central contention that the United States must play a leading role in world affairs but disagrees with virtually everything else they say and the tone in which they say it.
For someone of Dole's ironic and skeptical disposition, that tone tends to be excessively pretentious. Dole is not a vision man. He once told his friend Warren Rudman that he thought the whole vision thing "a phony," and on another occasion he commented disparagingly that "you can have all the vision you want, but you have to translate that into real laws and real programs. I know how to get things done. It's what I do."
There is much to be said for such skepticism. Scrutinized closely, the demand for vision usually amounts either simply to a desire for a more uplifting class of rhetoric or to a determination to impose America's will on the world. While the first is merely pretentious, the latter can be dangerously arrogant. Thus, Kristol and Kagan maintain that the proper course for the United States, in its pursuit of "benevolent hegemony," is to ignore the well-known advice of John Quincy Adams and go "abroad in search of monsters to destroy." They insist that anyone who would argue for less would be settling for "a policy of cowardice and dishonor."
Such hyperactive interventionism is bound to be uncongenial to Dole. It offends his sense of limits, imposed by the test of national interest. It violates his sense of prudence -- for however cloaked in good intentions, it is a reckless and dangerous policy, likely ultimately to unite other countries against the United States. And perhaps most important, it is alien to his sense of propriety. I once asked the man closest to Dole, Robert Ellsworth, which trait in his friend's character was most relevant to understanding his approach to foreign policy. Ellsworth is a subtle and sophisticated man, and he could have given an elaborate answer. Instead, he simply said, "He hates bullies." Now, to hate bullies is not only to hate being bullied or to see others being bullied; it is also to be averse to being a bully.
Questions of temperament and disposition aside, there are also compelling political reasons why Bob Dole cannot countenance global crusading. Most Republicans assign very high priority to downsizing the Federal Government, yet an ambitious, interventionist foreign policy is incompatible with that goal. Most Republicans give a high priority to balancing the budget, but a "proactive" foreign policy is very expensive. (Kristol and Kagan glibly propose adding up to $80 billion a year to the defense budget.) Many Republicans would agree with Edwin Feulner, the president of the Heritage Foundation, that "something is terribly wrong with America" and would therefore conclude that the biblical injunction, "Physician, heal thyself," should take precedence over any impulse to instruct and correct the world. America's capital city -- the very symbol of its power and authority -- is currently failing to supply safe drinking water to its inhabitants.
Dole certainly does believe in American leadership, but in a focused leadership meant to achieve specific goals, not an open-ended, diffuse one. Its coherence and purpose would come not from a sense of some grand mission but, more mundanely, from a clear definition of interests, the establishing of firm priorities among them and consistency and determination in their pursuit.
This very deliberate and pragmatic approach characterizes Dole's response to what he nominates, justifiably, as the most important challenge America faces: the rising power of China. First, strategic goals are set out clearly: "A China which does not threaten its neighbors and a China which plays by the rules of the international system of nonproliferation and trade, a China which is peaceful, prosperous and free." Then the steps necessary to advance toward these goals are itemized: "Prioritize our interests, communicate our priorities to the Chinese leadership and implement a policy in a confident and a consistent manner."
Dole realistically recognizes that "trade is not a panacea, and freer trade does not always lead to democracy," but rightly urges it as the best option for China. Capitalism has already "corroded central government control" in China, and Dole properly emphasizes the enormously significant move toward democratic elections at the municipal and village levels that is taking place there.
Always a results-oriented politician, Dole is dismissive of gestures: "Denying M.F.N. would not free a single dissident, halt a single missile sale, prevent a single threat to Taiwan or save a single innocent Chinese." But he insists with equal firmness that engagement should not mean acquiescence in Chinese misbehavior. Clear markers should be laid down -- on weapons proliferation ("top priority"), on the security of Taiwan -- and if these are violated, appropriate steps must be taken. If that means economic sanctions, they must be applied, but with intelligent discrimination -- thus, in responding to unacceptable weapons sales, their specific targets should be "enterprises controlled by the People's Liberation Army involved in proliferation -- not every American business in China."
If what Dole has to say about coping with the rising power of China demonstrates his strengths, what he has to say about the other great geopolitical problem facing Washington -- a Russia coping with the rapid decline of its power and status, while simultaneously undertaking a transition to democracy -- is much less impressive and exposes some of his weaknesses.
They are weaknesses that result largely from the grip of habit, and at the age of 73, acquiring the habit of breaking habits may be Bob Dole's hardest task. His instruction in foreign policy took place entirely during the cold war, when Moscow was the enemy. In Dole's mind, it often seems, it still is. He sees today's Russia as "all too willing to repeat old patterns, challenging the interest of America and the West," without elaborating quite what he has in mind. He draws a sharp distinction between "the Russia we hope to see" and "the Russia that truly exists," and he sees the latter as characterized by neoimperial policies. He accuses the Clinton Administration of "misguided romanticism" toward Russia.
On the crucial question of the expansion of NATO, Dole takes a tough line. He berates Clinton for deferring and delaying in the face of Russian pressure and pledges that he would move rapidly to bring Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO by 1998. But he would not stop there, for other states "from Slovenia to the Baltics rightly aspire to this goal." Even Ukraine, "despite the great pressures of its geography," should be regarded as eligible for "cooperative activities" with NATO. All this should proceed regardless of Russia's views. Moscow would simply "be told" that NATO is a defensive alliance and that it therefore has no cause for complaint.
There is no evidence in all this that Dole accords validity to any of the strong arguments against NATO expansion. He hasn't explained how to justify, in the absence of any credible threat, advancing a military alliance several hundred miles closer to the borders of another great power. Nor has he said why we should trust countries that have recently failed miserably with the modest problem of Bosnia to shoulder vast new commitments -- especially as they have all reduced their defense budgets substantially. He hasn't realistically faced the constraints imposed by the American people's aversion to taking casualties. Finally, he has ignored Winston Churchill's advice that, in victory, magnanimity to the defeated is usually the best policy -- advice that served America well with respect to Germany and Japan after Dole's "good war."
It has sometimes been suggested that Dole's strong views on Russia reflect the personal connections some of his closest advisers have with Central and Eastern Europe. It is more likely that they are shaped by 30 years of experience as a cold warrior and his hatred of "bullies," the latter activated by events in Chechnya.
On the whole, Dole's advisers reflect his own pragmatism and have been chosen for their experience and competence. If he wins, I would expect Dole to draw his major foreign policy and national security players from Rumsfeld, Kirkpatrick, Ellsworth, Colin Powell, McCain and Wolfowitz, and any combination from that list would constitute an impressive team. (With Madeleine Albright being touted if Clinton wins, for the first time in American history a woman is a very strong candidate for Secretary of State in both parties.)
How, in the meantime, can Bob Dole present his views on foreign policy so that they resonate more effectively with an American people who are largely indifferent to the outside world? Here are some suggestions:
First, insist that the United States must perform its vital role as world leader in ways consistent with its own nature and core values. America is not an imperial power but a republic, and it must lead as a republic -- not through command and force majeure but by cooperation, example, persuasion and encouragement. Its aim should not be to create a hierarchical world of leaders and followers but to create one in which responsibility, initiative and enterprise are widely dispersed.
Second, as the American people today wish to downsize government and revitalize civil society, Candidate Dole could stress that the real source of America's global leadership is not the power of its government but the energy, inventiveness and initiative of its society. Its great economic companies, its universities, its silicon valleys and (for better and for worse) its cultural and mass-entertainment industry -- it is these that will insure America's global leadership into the 21st century, not the State Department, the U.S. Information Agency or even the Pentagon. America's real foreign policy is itself.
Third, that said, he would acknowledge that in a dangerous world of competing states, military power remains indispensable. But in deciding when to deploy it, Washington should practice the sound federal principle of subsidiarity -- that is, allowing problems to be handled at the level closest to the problem. This way, a sense of responsibility can be developed throughout the international system and the United States can reserve its own interventions for the great issues involving its vital interests, acting as a balancer of last resort rather than a busybody and bully.
Fourth, when it does decide to intervene, the United States should not feel bound by the largely phony universalism of the United Nations. But its unilateralism should be tempered by a readiness to cooperate with like-minded states through ad hoc "coalitions of the willing," flexible arrangements that are better attuned to the fragmented nature of the new era than standing alliances.
Fifth, emphasize missile defense. Apart from satisfying a general desire for greater security, this appeals to two opposing constituencies: those who favor minimal international involvement (since viewed from one angle, it is the modern equivalent of raising the drawbridge) and those who favor an activist policy (since viewed from another, it reduces the inhibitions imposed by vulnerability).
Sixth, make character a foreign policy issue. When serious foreign policy crises occur, the country needs a President with a strong character. Clinton does not have one. At best, he fakes firmness and resolution, as with the Dayton accords or the recent responses to Saddam Hussein. Dole does have a strong character, tested by adversity. He has shown a willingness to adopt and stay with unpopular positions and to support Presidential policies even at a political cost. The worst that he is accused of is having a mean streak. But meanness, properly controlled and directed ("this dog is dangerous, when attacked it defends itself") is a strength in foreign policy.
Combined with the specifics that Dole has already spelled out, an approach to foreign policy along these lines would satisfy the wish that America should lead the world, reflect the concern to keep costs of blood and treasure low, harmonize with the prevailing Republican philosophy of limited government, meet the conservative concern for prudence and discrimination and reflect the nationalist concern with preserving freedom of action. And it would serve America's national interest well.

HEADLINE: PEROT, ALONE

BYLINE: By Gerald Posner; Gerald Posner is the author of "Citizen Perot." He last wrote about the Perot campaign for the Magazine in March.

 BODY:
INVITED ONLY A WEEK EARLIER BY THE LEADERS OF ROSS PEROT'S fledgling Reform Party, Richard Lamm received a rousing reception for his June 1 speech at the California State party gathering. Afterward, a reporter asked the former three-term Colorado governor if he had thought of running for President. He hesitated, then said he would consider it "under the right circumstances."
"I didn't think about it," says Lamm. "It just came out." 
 "We almost all had a heart attack," says Tom, his brother, who was standing nearby.
Lamm, of course, had no way of knowing that Perot had been desperately hoping to lure someone with Lamm's political credentials into the race. Perot, who had been claiming for months that the Reform Party was "not about me," fretted that if he did not have believable competition for the nomination, he would be roundly criticized for indulging in vanity politics.
Perot's party was at a crossroads. This election would tell whether it would be a movement or a monument to himself, and the decision -- like all decisions in the Reform Party -- was up to Perot. In the end, Perot toyed with Lamm, and the consequences of that dalliance could well affect more than Lamm's career. The Reform Party was America's best chance to sustain a real third party in decades. Its moment may have passed, and if it has, much of the reason can be traced to the strange dance between Lamm and Perot this summer.
 LAMM'S IMPULSIVE ANSWER ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT caught the attention of Russell Verney, then the Reform Party's national coordinator, who asked the Lamms to meet with Perot after his speech at the California gathering. Verney wanted to join Perot at the meeting, but the Texan was adamant he wanted to see the Lamm contingent alone.
Since his 1992 campaign, when he had hired, clashed with and then fired political professionals, Perot has relished his role as campaign manager, strategist and media adviser. The only people capable of standing up to him -- his business partner, Mort Meyerson, and his estranged attorney, Tom Luce -- are long gone. Perot's new, small group consisted of Verney, a former executive director of the Democratic Party in New Hampshire; Sharon Holman, his press spokeswoman and a former personal secretary, and Clay Mulford, his son-in-law and an attorney at a Dallas firm that grew fat on Perot business.
After Perot's talk, Dick and Tom Lamm passed Perot's security guards and entered a small, cramped room. Perot had briefly met Lamm before but now stepped forward as if they were old friends, vigorously shaking his hand. Then, sitting back in a folding chair and kicking his feet onto a table, Perot startled them. "Governor, I hope that you will be a Reform Party candidate," he said. "Your speech was well received, and you are one of the kind of guys we want. It's going to be a democratic process, and we'd like you to be part of it."
Tom Lamm, an attorney, asked who the other candidates would be and, more important, if Perot intended to run.
"Well, I certainly hope I don't have to be that candidate," said Perot in his most gracious tone.
"In my profession, that is nonresponsive," Tom Lamm said politely. "We don't want to run against you. It's your party; if you want it, you should run."
"I hope I don't have to," Perot assured them. "I would like to go back to work."
On several occasions, Perot leaned forward and looked Dick Lamm intensely in the eyes: "I want you in this race. We want you in this process." By the end, Tom Lamm decided Perot was not going to reveal his intentions. "I have cross-examined thousands of witnesses," he says, "and none were tougher than Ross Perot."
During the next few weeks, Perot made several encouraging calls to Lamm. By late June, Lamm thought that "Perot was testing me, waiting to see if I would have the courage to enter the race" and that if he ran, Perot would not. When he called Perot on Monday, July 8, to say he had decided to join the Reform race, Perot abruptly told him: "Do what you need to do. Godspeed and good luck."
Lamm was annoyed by Perot's response but quickly overlooked it as he booked an appearance on "Larry King Live" for Tuesday, July 9. Within hours Perot reserved an appearance on "King" for the following night. The Lamm brothers watched in anger as Perot, on July 10, eclipsed Lamm's entry. "I knew he was unpredictable," says Dick Lamm, "but this was not exactly welcoming me to the party."
Once Lamm entered the race, Perot himself made several decisions that tilted the race in his favor. One was his refusal to turn over the list of 1.3 million party members; the Perot camp claimed it was worth $4 million and that giving it to Lamm would be an illegal campaign contribution. Actually, Perot was concerned he could not control the solicitations Lamm would make to party members and feared if he gave the list to Lamm, "it could leak into the hands of one of the parties."
By mid-July, Lamm took his complaint about the list to the press. Perot was infuriated, privately protesting that he had gone out of his way to help Lamm. Their relationship was further strained when Perot could not stop Lamm from speaking to the press -- about the name of the accounting firm selected to tabulate the party's nominating ballots and about the number of votes each candidate received. On the second occasion, Perot called Lamm, curtly demanded an explanation and ordered him to "work on keeping this from happening in the future."
The final straw for Perot was learning of Lamm's desire for a debate from the press instead of from Lamm himself. The two men had shared Perot's private plane between two campaign stops. "He never brought it up a single time," Perot complains. He then ignored advisers who told him to maintain a cordial if distant relationship with Lamm and instead insisted he did not want to "talk to that guy anymore." When some suggested a debate could boost both his profile and that of the Reform Party, Perot vetoed the idea. Without any debates, there was little press or public interest in the race, and Perot started slipping in public-opinion polls, dropping five to six points by late July.
All of this contributed to very low television ratings at the dual Reform Party conventions in Long Beach, Calif., and Valley Forge, Pa., in August. By that time, the Lamm and Perot camps were completely estranged.
At Long Beach, when Russ Verney finished the only scheduled briefing session, Eric Anderson, Lamm's press spokesman, jumped to the podium and started listing complaints. Sharon Holman stopped chatting and walked nearer the lectern. Clay Mulford stiffened, his face flushed red with anger and he kept biting his lower lip. When Anderson stopped, the Perot cadre huddled in the rear of the room, clearly distressed over the public airing of the party's dirty laundry.
In the week before the second and final phase of the convention at Valley Forge, Lamm unleashed his harshest criticism of Perot, saying that his qualities as a businessman would not transfer well to politics and that unless Perot loosened his grip on the Reform Party, it would not survive.
The underlying differences that had caused friction between them were emphasized in the politicking at the conventions. Lamm arrived early, mingled with the crowds and made himself available to the press. But Perot flew in on his private jet just before his speeches, rejecting suggestions he energize Reform Party loyalists by mixing with them. He merely waved to the crowd from the stage after each of his talks before quickly departing. He did not field a single question from the press corps except for the "Larry King" interview after his acceptance speech. (During the speech, he looked at his watch several times, insuring he would not be late for the live show.)
The contrast between the candidates was never clearer than in the minibiographical films that introduced them. Lamm's film focused on his political experience and the issues. Perot's consisted of a barrage of stories about his saving people in distress, from a woman with an aneurysm to a member of the Paralympics to his own employees jailed in Iran. The message: If Ross Perot can do this for regular people, imagine what he can do for the country. It seemed more fitting for a run for head of the Red Cross than for the Presidency.
When the winning candidate was finally announced, with less than 5 percent of the Reform Party members voting, there was little suspense. Even Lamm seemed relieved it was over. Apparently exhausted, in his rambling final speech he compared his 78-day campaign to "drinking from a fire hose" and almost walked away from the podium before offering halfhearted congratulations to Perot.
 BY REFUSING TO PLAY BY ANY RULES BUT HIS OWN, ROSS Perot bypassed a unique opportunity to have real competition build the reputation of his embryonic party. Now that he has prevented Dick Lamm from mounting a genuine challenge, he has a much harder job running an effective campaign, much less building a third party. If he is to succeed at either, he must let others in -- and not just candidates but advisers.
For instance, one of his first post-nomination decisions (actually announced on "Larry King" within minutes of his convention speech) was to accept the nearly $30 million in Federal funds available as a result of his strong 1992 showing. Perot, known for his parsimony, ignored advisers who thought not only that it looked ungainly for a billionaire to take Government money but also that it was not enough to run his television campaign. Perot was seemingly not bothered by the apparent hypocrisy that in 1992 he had adamantly rejected the idea of running for office on public funds. The day after Perot's "King" appearance, Verney tried to backpedal, saying the decision was not final, but Perot refused to reconsider.
Perot overrode his advisers once again in their desire to start the campaign in mid-August and to hold more campaign rallies before Reform Party loyalists and friendly groups. (His choice for Vice President, Pat Choate, a maverick political economist whose controversial book "Agents of Influence" was seen by many as xenophobic, will have the role of attending more traditional campaign rallies.) They argued that Perot needed an early bounce in the polls, where he had languished in single digits. Yet except for a single August appearance at the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention -- in which he refused to stay to mix with the crowd after his speech -- Perot single-handedly vetoed the idea of an August kickoff; he believes that a late television blitz will dramatically lift him. While he did start his infomercial assault on Sept. 1, he agreed to only a few public appearances for the remainder of the month.
Since the political press will not play by Perot's rules -- that is, ask easy questions about his core issues as opposed to aggressive ones about his character -- he intends to get millions of dollars of free publicity with soft interviews only. While his aides know that putting their boss in close proximity to the press is often a sure-fire recipe for combustion, they believe it is a mistake to bypass the political press. Voters want a President who is tough, and ducking hard questions does not bode well for someone who could eventually deal with world leaders much tougher than the Washington press corps. Perot directed his own campaign against Lamm, and he intends to play the same role this fall. He has personally devised a battle plan to boost his standings in the polls, assuming that he would be in each of several Presidential debates. Whether he's included or not in each of the debates, he intends to go after both Clinton and Dole vigorously.
Whom does Perot hurt with this solo campaign? Ultimately Dole, because Perot prevents the Republican candidate from focusing just on catching Clinton. Also, in half a dozen states including Florida and Georgia, Dole and Clinton are almost even in the polls. Perot's good showing in those states could push them to Clinton and all but eliminate Dole's chances.
Perot's isolation in Dallas and his decision to run only a television campaign will make it difficult to ignite the enthusiasm his campaign needs. Pat Choate may be a forceful advocate for trade restrictions and campaign-finance reform, but he will do little to energize the Perot effort. For Perot to catch fire, he must listen to his Dallas advisers and develop a more personable side by attending campaign rallies, pressing the flesh with voters and standing up to the political press without losing his temper. Without a strong finish on Election Day, he will further hurt his new party's chances for long-term survival.
One thing is certain: on election night, whatever his final vote tally, Perot will have only himself to credit or blame. In 1992 he finished his election-night festivities by dancing with his wife, Margot, to Patsy Cline's "Crazy." This year Frank Sinatra's "My Way" would seem more appropriate.

HEADLINE: THE FOREIGN POLICY RACE;
Madeleine Albright's Audition

BYLINE: By Elaine Sciolino; Elaine Sciolino, a senior writer in the Washington bureau of The New York Times, has also served as The Times's chief diplomatic correspondent and United Nations bureau chief.

 BODY:
Under a warm late-afternoon sun, two middle-aged American women in smart pants suits slip out of their Prague hotel and stroll across Old Town Square. Trailed at a discreet distance by Secret Service agents, they study the clock on the 15th-century Town Hall, do some window shopping and walk into Wenceslas Square, where a protest rally in 1989 sparked the country's Velvet Revolution and the fall of Communism. They talk about their children, the professors they had at Wellesley College, walking, eating and vitamins. Madeleine Korbel Albright and Hillary Rodham Clinton are clearly having a good time.
It is four days of fun and diplomacy, captured in a few snapshots: Albright, the Czech-born American delegate to the United Nations, showing off the yellow house in which she once lived . . . the two women laughing uncontrollably when their umbrellas turn inside out in a driving rainstorm . . . sitting in a Prague cafe, editing their talking points over dumplings and cabbage for meetings in Slovakia the next day . . . singing "Good King Wenceslas" with a dear friend, President Vaclav Havel, as their Chevrolet Suburban pulls into Wenceslas Square. 
 Why is Albright playing tour guide in Prague for the First Lady? "Mostly because it's friendship," says Albright. "And it just seemed like a natural thing to do."
It may also have been an expedient thing to do. Should Clinton win another term and the Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, decide to leave, Albright would be a contender for his position. And one of the people likely to decide whether the time is right for a female Secretary of State is Hillary Clinton. In some quarters in the Administration, Albright's trip with the First Lady is viewed as so blatantly political that it is dismissed in just two words: the audition.
The 59-year-old Albright is certainly well positioned for a bigger role should there be a Clinton II. She is the first American delegate to the United Nations who is both a member of the Cabinet and a full-fledged participant in the National Security Council. She has moved into the vacuum left by an uneven foreign policy team and defined her role broadly, doing the speeches-and-talk-show circuit, visiting American troops to boost her standing with the military and subbing for the Secretary of State whenever necessary. She has embraced her job with the same energy that in an earlier life drove her to knit sweaters at the movies and take a crash course in Russian while her premature twins were isolated in incubators.
Her extracurricular activities leave only about half her time for the United Nations, prompting criticism there that she does not take her job seriously enough. Around Washington, her diverse schedule is seen as evidence of an ambition that has taken her from early marriage and motherhood, through a devastating divorce, to a professorship at Georgetown University and finally to being a key member of the President's foreign policy team, one who has a shot at becoming the most senior female official in United States history.
Perhaps the single biggest surprise about Albright -- and what has catapulted her into prominence -- is that's she's so good in public, particularly on television. "CNN is the 16th member of the Security Council," she likes to say. The President wants her in front of the cameras, and largely by default she has earned a reputation as the most passionate and articulate defender of Clinton's foreign policy.
"I hate to sound this way because it makes me sound so conceited," she says, "but I do think I'm playing a larger role than any U.N. ambassador ever."
Like Pamela Harriman, Clinton's Ambassador to France, Albright has made it in a world dominated by men, because of men. Both women used their wealth and their Georgetown homes as meeting places for rich, important and potentially important Democrats. Harriman made her way because of her personal relationships with men; Albright moved up because she worked hard for men, made them look good and believed in them. "I was the world's perfect staffer," she says. Or the ultimate good daughter.
What she may lack in innate brilliance, she makes up for in dedication. Her critics whisper that she hasn't written a serious work in 25 years of studying foreign policy and that she lacks strategic vision. None of this fazes Albright, whose importance is beginning to transcend that of the men she works for. Sitting in an armchair in the peach-and-yellow living room of her Georgetown town house, Albright talks straight. "I'm not that smart," she says. "I work very hard."
It would be hard for most men in public life to be so self-deprecating, or so honest.
ON A COOL SATURDAY afternoon at the Orange Bowl, 60,000 Cuban-Americans are on their feet cheering wildly, not for the Miami Dolphins but for Madeleine Albright. "Madeleine, libertad! Madeleine, libertad!" they cry over and over. She waves, campaign-style. The applause is so overwhelming she can barely get through her speech.
"We thought she was running for mayor of Miami down there," Clinton joked afterward. Albright, he added, "has a great political feel."
In a Presidential election year in which Florida's 25 electoral votes are up for grabs, a little Cuba-bashing can go a long way. Only weeks before that March rally, Cuban-American leaders had been complaining loudly that Clinton was too easy on Fidel Castro, and the leading Republican Presidential candidate, Bob Dole, was scoring easy political points.
But that all changed when Cuban jet fighters downed two unarmed civilian planes from Miami and Albright went on the offensive in the Security Council. Sneering at the worst impulses of men, she said something no male diplomat would dare say in polite company: the Spanish curse word for testicles. "Frankly, this is not cojones, this is cowardice," she sputtered, echoing the very word the Cuban pilots had used as they boasted about their attack.
Diplomatically, it may have been her worst moment at the United Nations, where the remark was greeted with outrage. "She tried to say a man's word, and it was uncalled for," says Diego Arria, a former Venezuelan representative. "I wouldn't even say that word, not even on my farm."
Politically, though, it was clearly her best moment. And it pleased the President. "Probably the most effective one-liner in the whole Administration's foreign policy," Clinton called it. "The Cuban-Americans loved it so much they had bumper stickers made up. I have a bumper sticker with Madeleine's quote on it."
Political sense, the ability to project passion and energy -- these are the keys to campaigns and to people's souls, and they have set Albright apart from colleagues in the Administration who measure their words but fail to connect. They also explain why Albright is considered a valuable weapon against the Republicans and why Clinton likes her so much. "I am not a diplomat," she likes to say. "I am such a political person."
She has taken her campaign to sell Clinton's foreign policy around the world, to obscure capitals like Tblisi and Baku that normally wouldn't make a Secretary of State's itinerary. And she rarely passes up an opportunity to charm the military. Dressed in an orange life vest, a helmet and goggles on the deck of the aircraft carrier Constellation, a big grin on her face, her striped pants flapping in the wind, she looks much more comfortable than did her former boss, Michael Dukakis, when he peeked out of a tank during the 1988 Presidential campaign.
Her solid relationship with President Clinton assures her a seat at the policy-making table. They first got to know each other when he, as Governor of Arkansas, went to Boston to help prepare Dukakis for the 1988 Presidential debate. After Dukakis lost the election, Clinton and Albright stayed in touch. When Clinton wanted to get into the Council on Foreign Relations in 1989, he turned to Albright for a recommendation. "He has an active mind and an excellent background," she wrote. (He got in.) Albright also derives power from her lofty place in the State Department. George Bush's Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d -- fearing competition from one of the nation's most talented diplomats -- banished his envoy, Thomas Pickering, from the building. But Christopher doesn't feel threatened by Albright, who keeps disputes inside the Administration. He has rewarded that loyalty with a large suite of offices on the floor just below his.
IN AN ADMINISTRATION THAT WAFFLED on China, retreated from Somalia and procrastinated before making peace in Bosnia, she stands out as always wanting to do more. More than many of her foreign policy colleagues, Albright is comfortable with the projection of American power, a view that flows from her experiences growing up in Europe during World War II and fleeing as a refugee to America. Whether or not an intervention meets the test of a "vital national interest" is less important for her than whether the United States can do good in the world, using military power if necessary.
"My mind-set is Munich; most of my generation's is Vietnam," she says. "I saw what happened when a dictator was allowed to take over a piece of a country and the country went down the tubes. And I saw the opposite during the war when America joined the fight. For me, America is really, truly the indispensable nation. I've never seen America as an imperialist or colonialist or meddling country."
The lesson of Munich is to get in; that of Vietnam is to stay out. And it is that difference that set her apart from her colleagues early on in the Administration, particularly from Colin Powell, then the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Fresh off his victory in the Persian Gulf war, Powell had little trouble convincing Clinton and his team to abstain from using force in Bosnia.
Except for Albright. Haunted by parallels to the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1938, she argued in a memo to the President in April 1993 for punitive NATO air strikes to destroy the tanks and heavy weapons of the Bosnian Serbs and to demolish the bridges and transit points used to ship weapons from Serbia.
In his memoir, "My American Journey," Powell recalls a discussion with Albright on Bosnia. "What's the point of having this superb military you're always talking about if we can't use it?" she asked him.
"I thought I would have an aneurysm," wrote the originator of the Powell doctrine, the idea that the United States should intervene militarily -- and with overwhelming force -- only when its vital interests are threatened. "American G.I.'s were not toy soldiers to be moved around on some sort of global game board." Powell had a close ally in Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, who lectured Albright that the kinds of issues the general was raising "are exactly the ones the military never asked during Vietnam."
Albright now delights in telling people that NATO conducted its first serious air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs the week Powell's book came out. Even better, they worked, driving the Bosnian Serbs to the bargaining table. "I felt some vindication," she says. "It wasn't easy being a civilian woman having a disagreement with the hero of the Western world. But maybe he'd want to rewrite that page now."
A week touring the country with Albright is studded with examples of her plain-spoken, sound-bite approach to foreign policy. On why the United States engages with China but isolates Cuba: "We do not have a cookie cutter approach to policy. China is a world power. . . . Cuba is an embarrassment to the Western Hemisphere."
On whether a Communist-dominated Soviet Union could come back: "I do not see it coming back. What is always possible . . . is for things to be chaotic in a way where there will be a turning to more authoritarian ways."
On NATO expansion: "We're not out there trolling for new alliances."
On the Middle East: "The peace process there is not reversible."
On land mines: "I've never seen so many one-legged people as I have in Angola."
On arms sales: "The trading of arms is disgusting and contributes to horrors around the world. With the breakup of the Soviet Union, it's a bazaar out there."
Within the Administration, she has a close ally in Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The general was raised in Poland and, like Albright, sees the world through the lens of Munich. He too believes that the Powell doctrine is a cold war relic, ill suited to today's more fluid world system. But others remain closer to Powell's view: Lake, who has advocated greater involvement, but episodically; Christopher, who is always cautious and deliberate, and the Secretary of Defense, William Perry, who is the most reluctant to commit American forces.
Christopher often disagrees with Albright's brand of activism, but always politely and usually in private. By contrast, Lake demonstrates his exasperation with her long, impassioned digressions by drumming his fingers, gazing around the room or cutting her off in meetings. "Madeleine sometimes likes to free-form think," says a senior White House official who is a fan of Lake's. "Tony doesn't."
A senior State Department official in Albright's camp sees it differently. "There's not any yelling and screaming, but there are unmistakable signs of impatience when Madeleine challenges Tony's views." For that reason, the official adds, Albright sometimes has more impact if she participates from New York through a secure television system, so she can interrupt when she wants to.
But even Lake found a willing teammate in Albright in August 1995, when he undertook a new peace initiative for Bosnia. Albright's memo attacking the status quo and laying out a plan for action, including the use of American military force, helped establish the groundwork for the Dayton accords. Although Clinton said afterward that Albright's arguments were the most compelling ones he heard, she has received little credit. "Someday it shall be known," she says wistfully, sitting in a Prague cafe. "The meek shall inherit the earth."
Albright's thinking on the use of force has evolved in recent years. Like many mainstream Democrats, she initially opposed going to war against Iraq. Just weeks before President Bush sent American troops to battle, she was still saying that sanctions should be given more of a chance to work. She has since called her view "a mistake."
She would be the first to admit that she has become harder-edged since the beginning of the Administration. The most prominent example is the abandonment of her crusade for what in 1993 she called "assertive multilateralism." She argued that the United States could not afford, financially or politically, to play global Lone Ranger, and that international coalitions should be put together when force is needed. But she was savaged by Republicans on Capitol Hill and by the foreign policy establishment for what was perceived as relinquishing American sovereignty to the United Nations. "It didn't catch on," she says now. "People thought it didn't work. I got tired of having to explain it. So I just let it go."
Now she is plugging a more modest slogan, what she calls "the doability doctrine": that America should use its military power in flexible ways to achieve practical, if sometimes limited, goals. "You deal with the pragmatic situation you have," she says. "You may have to scale back your objectives and decide that just because you cannot do everything does not mean you should do nothing."
For Albright, Bosnia is one example of the Administration's committing American troops in a mission with limited -- if imperfect -- goals. "In the best of all possible worlds it would have been great to eradicate the power of those determined to undermine the multi-ethnic state of Bosnia," she says. Nevertheless, she considers a deeply flawed peace better than war.
The recent military attacks on Iraq are another example. In her view, the operation was a practical solution that served American interests but avoided the choice between sending American ground forces into a full-fledged war or doing nothing. "Those who say America has to dominate the world, and that you have to either control everything or go home," she says, "don't understand the way power is projected at the end of this century."
In some cases, however, "doability" means doing nothing. Back in 1993, Albright called Somalia a "failed state" that the international community must help by disarming all its warlords. But after 18 American soldiers were killed and the United States withdrew, she pulled back as well. So today, while she calls Burundi "a country on the verge of national suicide," she does not propose sending in troops to rescue it. The average American, she tells audiences, "wouldn't know where Burundi is."
 ALL THE POPPING off to obscure capitals and war zones, all the road shows and campaign appearances and all the television talk shows don't leave a lot of time for the day job: chief American representative at the United Nations. Even if the post lacks automatic Cabinet rank, the public nature of the job, the proximity to Washington and the need to deal with every member country of the United Nations makes it much more important than a mere ambassadorial post. It also comes with a staff of more than 100 and a $27,000-a-month suite at the top of the Waldorf Towers.
During the cold war, when the United Nations was paralyzed by superpower rivalry, American envoys more often than not were verbal crusaders struggling to extend America's sphere of influence. Their styles and strategies and mandates varied. Adlai Stevenson got the appointment because President Kennedy wanted him in a dignified setting away from Washington. George Bush had little input into policy but charmed his colleagues with his impeccable manners. Andrew Young lent sex appeal to the normally staid post by roaming around Africa, where he was treated like a rock star. Daniel Patrick Moynihan said the job all depended on when you were there; his bashing of the United Nations as anti-American and anti-Israeli helped him in his subsequent race for the Senate.
Jeane Kirkpatrick spent as little time as she could inside the United Nations and never hid her contempt for the place. "I'd rather be in Philadelphia," she once said. Her successor, Vernon Walters, loved it there; he ate his way through the reception lines and told funny stories in several languages. By most accounts, the best-liked American envoy was Thomas Pickering, President Bush's choice and now Ambassador to Russia. Frozen out of Bush's policy-making circle, he was nevertheless a diplomat's diplomat, resolving numerous disputes with creative formulas that countries could not refuse.
Unlike Pickering, Albright doesn't spend much time working the hallways; the way her foreign colleagues see it, she doesn't spend much time there at all. When she does show up, they complain, she seeks out the television cameras more than them.
And her combative style rankles. While Pickering was known as "the magician," Albright is called "the queen of mean." When the Chinese representative couldn't vote on an anti-Cuba statement because he didn't have instructions, she kept the Security Council in session until 4 A.M. until he got them. When the British representative tried to finesse a resolution partly lifting sanctions on Serbia, Albright concluded that compromise was impossible and walked out of the room.
"Abrasive? In the U.N. they'd call her worse than that," says Arria, who considers her a friend. "She projects a tough, cold image. I know her as the opposite of that, but even I don't recognize her sometimes when she speaks."
Never has the job of American representative been so easy -- or so difficult. In the post-cold-war world, it usually doesn't take much arm-twisting for the United States to get its way. The Russians won't challenge the United States as long as they are left alone in the countries that were once part of the Soviet empire; the Chinese won't veto any resolution that doesn't directly affect their own security.
Thus, Albright has managed to pull off some surprising successes. Take the American-led invasion of Haiti. In July 1994, a State Department memo said it would be "folly" to ask the Security Council to authorize the invasion; Christopher and Perry were also skeptical. But Albright told Clinton, "If I have the authority, I think I can do it." She did.
But the refusal of Congress to pay its back dues -- more than $1.1 billion worth -- has enraged other member states, including America's closest allies, and undercut American authority. That bad feeling has hurt the United States in its campaign to deny Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali a second five-year term.
From the start, there was never any love lost between Albright and the Egyptian-born career diplomat. She felt he went beyond his authority and was ineffective in reforming the institution -- although he has presided over the largest staff reductions and budget cuts in the organization's history. "People are concerned when Boutros-Ghali seems to overstep and believes he's in charge of everything," she once said.
So early this year, Albright urged the Administration to dump Boutros-Ghali when his term expires in December. After he resisted, Christopher stepped in and -- ignoring Albright's reservations -- offered a compromise that would extend the Secretary General's term a year. When the negotiations later blew up, Albright was on the road. Working the phones from Bubba's Hundred Sandwiches on the highway between San Diego and Los Angeles, she tried to head off trouble. But lacking the authority to inform United Nations officials and diplomats ahead of time, her hands were tied. Most of them learned of the decision in the newspaper the next morning and blamed her for the mess.
Since then, the Security Council has refused Albright's pleas to begin the process of choosing a new candidate before the American Presidential election. The United States does not have its own candidate, which may be just as well. There is still enough anti-Americanism in the U.N. and so much ill feeling about the clumsy way the matter has been handled that any "American" candidate would automatically lose.
"The decision to dump Boutros-Ghali is dumb foreign policy and it doesn't move us anywhere at the U.N.," says Lawrence S. Eagleburger, a former Secretary of State in the Bush Administration. "But I'm probably one of the few people who thinks he's done a good job."
 IT IS 10:30 P.M. IN LOS Angeles and Albright, dressed in a taupe dress and shawl, is off to dinner with Barbra Streisand. Since the representative awoke in her quarters on the Constellation in the Pacific this morning, she has had breakfast with the officers, flown back to San Diego in a tiny C-2 prop plane, given a speech at a luncheon in her honor, worked her cell phone on the Boutros-Ghali embroglio, driven to Los Angeles, attended a reception with Korean-Americans and given two interviews and a news conference. Most people would call it a day.
But not Albright. Streisand wants to show off her new house, so Albright shoehorns in another event. The women, who met at a Hollywood Women's Political Caucus function in early 1993, go antiquing together, talk often on the phone and try to get together whenever they're in the same city.
"You know, you meet certain people and you have a rapport or you don't," Streisand says. "You share the same kind of feelings about life and politics and whatever. And we just became instant friends. We talk about everything. We talk about love, relationships, a lot of politics."
They also talk a lot about the difficulties of being powerful women in men's worlds. "We're vulnerable women in powerful positions," says Streisand. "We're not toughies. And yet we are tough in some ways. I mean we're multifaceted. We're little girls at moments, we're teen-agers and we're grown-ups. And we'd like to be accepted for all those qualities. And the rare person sees through the powerful position and sees you as a woman."
Tough or sweet, hard or soft. The tension is always there for Albright and it is sometimes difficult to find the right balance.
In a way, she is the ultimate independent woman, a mother of three grown daughters with careers and a grandmother of two, who expresses no need or even desire for a man in her life. "There's no way, unless I were married to some truly unusual man who had a whole life of his own, that I could possibly be married," she says. "And there are not a lot of them around."
She resents being asked about it. "There are lots of questions about women that don't come up for men, like 'How do you stand being alone?' " she says, the anger rising in her voice. Albright also feels she is held to a higher standard because she is a woman, a standard that dictates nurturing and soft-edged behavior. "There is this slight sense that women have to be saints or Joan of Arc and it's not always possible," she says.
Albright is particularly thin-skinned when journalists write about how she looks. In the same breath, she says it doesn't matter, but the frustration pours out. "When I work I really work," she says. "I rub my eyes and my makeup comes off and I stick pencils in my hair. So I've given up. If some days my hair doesn't look great or some days I look overdone, so be it. Or if I wear a red suit and one of the female reporters says I look like a fat little red ball, that's her problem."
But in the waiting room at a local television studio in Cleveland, where she is svelte compared with the plus-size models for Liz Claiborne, she pulls the skirt of her red suit away from her hips to show how loose it is. "Twenty pounds since February and still counting." She insists she "wears whatever fits." What fits that day is Givenchy.
It's a long way from Prague, and from her diplomat father, Josef Korbel, who taught her how to think and encouraged her to push herself beyond her limits. When Albright tells the story of her childhood as Marie Jana Korbel, it is her father's story as well: how as a junior officer in the diplomatic corps he watched in horror as the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia in 1938; how the family survived World War II in Britain; how he went to Belgrade as the Czech Ambassador after the war; how he and his wife, Anna, insisted that Marie Jana leave home at age 10 for a boarding school in Switzerland (where she acquired the name Madeleine); how he might have become foreign minister if the Communists had not seized power.
But the Communists did seize power, in a coup in 1948. Korbel was forced to start over. He and his wife and three children arrived in the United States in 1949 and were eventually granted asylum as displaced persons. He later became dean of the School of International Affairs at the University of Denver and wrote books; Anna worked odd clerical jobs to earn extra money.
Even as a teen-ager, Albright by her own admission was the kind of hard worker who used "colored folders and 13 different colored pens." She won the Rocky Mountain Empire United Nations Contest by reciting all the member countries in alphabetical order and went to Wellesley College on a scholarship.
"Madeleine was the responsible one," says her younger sister, Kathy Silva, a special assistant in the Department of Education. "She was very serious. She's a lot more fun now."
Albright graduated from college with honors in 1959 and three days later married her college sweetheart, Joseph Medill Patterson Albright, the scion of a wealthy newspaper family. He became an important journalist; she became a mother. But that was not enough. Over the next decade, while raising three daughters, she took graduate courses at Columbia University, getting up at 4:30 every morning to work on her doctoral dissertation.
"Daddy reincarnate," Silva calls her.
Some people make their way through bureaucratic thickets by force of intellect. Others bully their way through. Albright builds friendships with the right people. She has played both protegee to powerful men and mentor to younger men and women. She met Senator Edmund S. Muskie, the Maine Democrat, when she worked on his 1972 Presidential campaign, and went on to become his chief legislative assistant. Two years later she went to work in the White House as Congressional liaison for a former professor, the national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. It was a job for someone a decade younger, but Albright had a lot of catching up to do.
In Albright's view, the greatest setback in her life was her divorce. Banished to a "think tank" after the Democrats were ousted from the White House in 1980, her world fell apart after her husband told her that the marriage she thought was perfect was fatally flawed. Even today, she wears the mantle of the spurned woman.
Sitting on an upholstered armchair in the living room of her Georgetown town house, she tells the story as straight and raw as if it just happened: "It was Jan. 13, 1982, the day of the Air Florida crash and a massive snowstorm. At 8 o'clock in the morning and sitting on this very chair was Joe Albright, who said to me, 'This marriage is dead and I'm in love with somebody else.' "
Joe Albright says only: "Madeleine has worked very hard to get where she is and I wish her well. She and I are on cordial terms."
When Albright walked out, he left behind the townhouse, the 370-acre farm in Virginia and a generous investment portfolio. Madeleine Albright was rich but restless. Until Bill Clinton's victory in 1992, she waited in the wings, teaching international relations at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service.
Her students elected her best professor four years in a row; her colleagues regarded her as a capable synthesizer whose passion was politics more than scholarship. "I never thought of myself -- or I was never allowed to think of myself -- as a serious academic," she says. "I came into academia late. I'm not one of the people who wrote great tomes."
Albright made up for that by throwing herself into Democratic politics, decorating her Georgetown salon with the best Democratic thinkers and building up connections along the way. She served as foreign policy adviser to Geraldine Ferraro, the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee in 1984, so it was natural that she became chief foreign policy adviser to Michael Dukakis, the Democratic Presidential nominee four years later. Her later work as president of the Center for National Policy, a nonpartisan research organization, prevented her from working directly for the Clinton campaign. But she had paid her dues. When Clinton promised a Cabinet of diversity that would "look like America," she was ready.
AT THE AIRPORT IN THE Slovak capital of Bratislava, Albright bids a fond farewell to Hillary Clinton. The First Lady goes on to Budapest; Albright plans to drive to Vienna to catch a flight to New York the next morning.
But not before one final news conference. As soon as the First Lady's plane takes off, Albright strides back into the V.I.P. lounge to tell reporters how tough she had been with Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. It is clearly not an anonymous approach to diplomacy. It is also Secretary of State work.
Clinton has not even been re-elected but Albright and numerous other figures are already jockeying for Christopher's job, should he decide to step down. There is no clear favorite in the Secretary of State sweepstakes; Clinton is likely to choose the person he thinks will help him the most, not necessarily the one he likes the best. And he may decide against making any changes, having told aides recently that he is comfortable with his current team. "It's a jinx to talk about it," he has said.
When Christopher was thinking of leaving nearly two years ago, Clinton sounded out both Colin Powell and Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat, neither of whom was interested. Despite Powell's sharp criticism of Clinton in his memoirs and his endorsement of Dole for President, Clinton is said to consider him a first-rate strategic thinker. Even his views on the use of force are not enough to turn Clinton off. Still, Powell has made clear in private conversations that he is no more interested in the job in a Democratic Administration than he ever was.
Clinton forgave Nunn long ago for opposing his plan to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military, and Nunn has already decided not to run again for the Senate. A centrist who commands respect among Democrats and Republicans on the Hill, Nunn would bring a command of both foreign policy and defense issues and strong views on how to deal with both Russia and China. Then again, Nunn would make an equally attractive candidate as Defense Secretary, a position that some Clinton Administration officials say has been promised to the Director of Central Intelligence, John Deutch, should Perry leave the post.
Of course, Clinton could cast a wider net. In a meeting with the President in December 1994, when Christopher discussed the possibility of resigning, the Secretary brought along a list of possible successors. Powell and Nunn were on the list, along with several others, including George Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader; Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State, and one woman -- Albright.
Mitchell had little foreign policy experience in his years in the Senate but is making up for lost time. He spends much of his time as a special negotiator on Northern Ireland and a year ago became chairman of the International Crisis Group, a privately financed organization that works to help prevent conflict around the world.
Talbott has been close to Clinton since they were roommates as Rhodes scholars, but he suffered through a bruising Senate confirmation in 1993 because of columns he wrote for Time magazine. He is more likely to be considered for national security adviser, which does not require Senate confirmation, should Lake move on.
Richard C. Holbrooke, the former Assistant Secretary of State for Europe, was widely touted in the media as a possible successor to Christopher or even Albright after he successfully negotiated the peace settlement in Bosnia. He would bring a Kissingerian toughness to either job and an ability to get things done. But in the Clinton Administration he is considered a bureaucratic bully whose priority is too often to make himself look good at others' expense. Moreover, he and Lake do not get along.
Walter Mondale, the Ambassador to Japan and former Vice President, knows trade issues and Asia policy and would bring major stature to the job. Secretary of Commerce Mickey Kantor is a long shot because of his shallow grounding in national security issues; but he is a friend of the President and would put global economics at the top of his foreign policy agenda.
Then there's Anthony Lake, who is increasingly active in making the Administration's foreign policy and who is also said to covet Christopher's job. Lake's strengths are his intellect and relationship with Clinton. His weaknesses, say friends and critics who work with him, are his penchant for secrecy and his reluctance to delegate authority. As a result, they say, it takes forever to get decisions made.
Curiously, Albright's future may depend almost as much on the Attorney General, Janet Reno, as it does on Warren Christopher. If Reno, who has Parkinson's disease, should leave, and if Clinton decides he needs a woman in a serious, front-line Cabinet post, Albright would have a clear shot at Secretary of State. Besides her reputation as a loyal, energetic and telegenic defender of the faith, she now has the experience of an insider.
On the other hand, many in Washington believe that Clinton could decide to promote Reno's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, to Attorney General and leave Albright at the United Nations.
Albright doesn't deny her interest in becoming Secretary of State; given the public nature of the competition, that would be foolish. "There isn't anybody, I would be willing to say, who has been involved in foreign policy who hasn't thought about the concept," she says over breakfast at the American Ambassador's residence in Vienna. "I always did think it was something that was totally impossible. But I have found it interesting that people at least consider it possible that a woman might be Secretary of State."
Her most obvious weakness is her lack of knowledge or interest in global economic issues. The passion she shows for banning land mines or labeling Saddam Hussein a war criminal deserts her in debates on stealing intellectual property or eliminating tariffs on flat glass.
In addition, she is regarded as a good firefighter who deals capably with individual crises but has yet to prove herself as a broad strategic thinker. But policy is made in the doing, not the thinking. And even some Republicans admit that she might make a pretty good Secretary of State.
"She represents the best instincts of this Administration on foreign policy," says Paul Wolfowitz, dean of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, an adviser to the Dole campaign and a contender for Secretary of State in a Dole administration. "Unfortunately she often doesn't get the support she should. I think good solid instincts would go a long way in improving the performance of this Administration. Clinton could do a lot worse than make Madeleine Secretary of State."
Albright has another surprising ally -- Jeane Kirkpatrick. As a chairwoman of Bob Dole's Presidential campaign, Kirkpatrick also has a chance to become the first female Secretary of State. "I never thought there would be two women even remotely being mentioned as Secretary of State," Kirkpatrick says. "I hope if Bill Clinton is re-elected, he'll appoint Madeleine. I'd like to see a woman in the job."
But if the President is re-elected and asks Albright to stay just where she is, she promises she will, no complaints. "It is way beyond any of my dreams," she says about her place in life. "God willing, it will all go on."

Asian Investment Is on the Rise in Los Angeles

BYLINE: By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
JAPANESE investment in the top hotels and office towers in Los Angeles soared during the 1980's and then crashed with the real estate market in the early 1990's. Now, Asian investment is once again increasing, mainly from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Indonesia, driven partly by bargain real estate prices here and political uncertainty at home.
In the last three years, Asian-based companies have bought at least 15 buildings in the Los Angeles area, each priced at more than $10 million, according to the Financial Capital Investment Company, which helps Asians buy American property. Analysts and Asian buyers say these transactions -- which the company says total nearly $450 million -- reflect Asia's growing prosperity and a belief that Southern California's struggling commercial property market has hit bottom. 
 For instance, a Hong Kong-based syndicate, B. W. Hotels, bought the luxury Regent Beverly Wilshire in February for a reported $100 million. The landmark 275-room, 12-story Beverly Hills hotel, featured in the film "Pretty Woman," is near the chic shopping street Rodeo Drive.
"We think Los Angeles has turned around in hospitality," said Ambrose Cheung, president of B. W. Hotels. "It is now on the upswing. We think the real estate situation is positive. It's about coming in at the right time."
For years, Taiwanese entrepreneurs have been major investors in small-scale projects like shopping centers, warehouses and apartment buildings in the Los Angeles area, and they typically have focused on those communities with a large Asian presence. But Randall J. Lee, an Asian economic consultant with Lilly Enterprises here, said the new wave of Asian investment was increasingly of a larger scale.
"We are going to continue to see the mom-and-pop guys buying the small shopping centers," Mr. Lee said. "But we are beginning to see the bigger players, their equivalent of Goldman Sachs."
In the Chinese style, many investors are low profile, which makes tracking sales difficult, said Richard Alter, managing director of Financial Investment Capital. He said investors typically formed a syndicate, paid in cash and focused on second-tier properties like midsize office towers and business-class hotels that do not draw as much attention or attract as much competitive bidding.
"We try to go after some properties that the big Wall Street firms would not go after," Mr. Alter said. "Size makes a difference. We go for commercially viable properties, but not the Statue of Liberty. We don't want to pay for the marquee value."
Real estate brokers and Asian investors here say the recent interest in Los Angeles real estate is partly a product of confidence in Southern California's improving economy and partly an example of bottom fishing. Investors are capitalizing on real estate values that are down nearly 50 percent from their peak in the late 1980's after years of recession coupled with cutbacks in the defense sector.
Despite the city's budding recovery, downtown is suffering from a glut of office space and hotel rooms. Office vacancy rates downtown have hovered near 20 percent for some time, according to the Los Angeles County Economic Development office, while the area's hotel occupancy is 59.9 percent for the year through June, according to PKF Consulting, a hotel industry advisory service.
ON the other hand, downtown is regarded as having a solid market base since there are only a few convention-sized hotels. And the city's center is being considered as a site for a new sports arena, which could help revitalize the area.
"Asian buyers are getting great bargains on all these properties and they sense that there is great economic potential here," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the county's economic development office.
Those companies selling big properties bought during the boom years are generally losing millions of dollars in the process. In a few cases, the losers are Japanese companies, part of a multibillion-dollar divestment of their American assets.
For example, TAT Los Angeles Ltd., one such Japanese company, bought the ornate, 11-story, 683-room Biltmore Hotel and its adjoining 22-story office tower for a reported $219 million in 1989 and then sold it in June to Hong Kong-based Regal Hotels at a 70 percent loss. Many Japanese companies bought American property with borrowed money, and now their banks are demanding payment.
Peter Zen, a director of the Taiwan-based Forward Time Corporation, which paid nearly $50 million last year for Los Angeles' largest hotel, the 1,368-room, glass-faced Westin Bonaventure Hotel and Suites, said property in Los Angeles is relatively inexpensive compared with many Asian cities. He said land in Los Angeles could cost only $300 a square foot, versus $2,000 a square foot in Taipei.
Moreover, he said, many Asian investors regarded the United States as a safe haven for capital, especially in light of recent events in their home countries. For instance, Indonesian protesters clashed with the police in Jakarta in July. At the same time, Taiwan is frequently swept by fears of invasion from China and the British colony of Hong Kong is 10 months from reintegration with mainland China.
"The United States is a country where you don't have to worry about expropriation, or that the government is going to topple every day," Mr. Zen said.
But, he added, there is a trade-off to investing in Los Angeles versus Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur. Profits are generally lower in Los Angeles, and its land values are expected to increase much more slowly than in Asia's prospering cities.
"You can't compare Los Angeles to the Far East, where you have a lot of upside," Mr. Zen said. "Here, it's very stable. You turn out some earnings every year."
Asian companies often do not get involved with the demands of owning industrial space, and instead focus on office towers and hotels, which are considered to be easier to operate. Frequently, Asians hire an American company to manage the property.
Since profiting from significant short-term property appreciation in Los Angeles is unlikely, many Asian buyers say they have a longer-term commitment to their acquisitions, at least for the near future. As a result, many investors plan property improvements to attract business.
FOR example, the Biltmore Hotel, built in 1922, will get a $10 million to $20 million renovation. The Regent Beverly Wilshire will get 100 new suites on five vacant floors in roughly 18 months.
"Suites, bungalows and villas are in very high demand," Mr. Cheung said. "These are the rooms that can command a very high rate from the entertainment, performing arts, and fashion industries."
Asian real estate buyers generally cited an increasing familiarity with the United States, either through their own education here or that of their children, as a major investment factor. Asian companies are focusing most of their purchases on New York and North America's major Pacific cities, all of which are easily reached from Asia and have large Asian communities. Los Angeles County's Asian population in 1995 was estimated at 907,000 by the state Department of Finance.
"These investors go where there are more Asians and more infrastructure," Mr. Alter said. "That makes them more comfortable than in Salt Lake City or Cleveland."
Mr. Lee said investment in Los Angeles real estate should increase as wealth spreads to more Asian countries. In particular, he said companies from mainland China, some of which have already participated in a few medium-sized deals in Los Angeles, should be a growing source of capital.
"A lot of people don't realize that there is a lot of wealth being created in China," Mr. Lee said. "Before it was the government people, now it's the entrepreneurs."

TRIPWIRE
Korea and U.S. Foreign Policy in a Changed World.
By Doug Bandow.
255 pp. Washington:
Cato Institute. Cloth, $19.95. Paper, $9.95.
Through all the public soul searching about America's post-cold-war security responsibilities, one commitment has gone generally unchallenged: to maintain a United States military presence on the Korean peninsula. At the moment this presence amounts to 37,000 troops on the ground in the Republic of Korea, along with air and naval support. The troops are there, as they have been since the 1953 Korean War armistice, for both real and symbolic purposes. Any attack by North Korea on the South will automatically engage the United States. 
 The reasoning behind this commitment is straightforward enough. The so-called People's Republic of Korea, even shorn of its former Russian and Chinese allies, and even with its economy disintegrating, remains a rogue country, a danger to peace in the region. At least a portion of Pyongyang's Stalinist high command seems interested in working out some kind of peaceful coexistence with its neighbors, but the next moves of the militarist clique that probably runs the country remain unpredictable. And the military card is all that they have left to play.
Worst of all, Seoul, the capital and nerve center of the Republic of Korea, with a population of 12 million, is a hostage to geography. Barely 30 miles from the border, it sits almost within artillery range of the North Koreans. In the last analysis the prospect of immediate American retaliation is probably the one factor that the isolated satraps in Pyongyang -- when they think of a military gamble -- cannot ignore.
Not so, writes Doug Bandow in "Tripwire." A senior fellow at the aggressively libertarian Cato Institute, Mr. Bandow has visited both North and South Korea and obviously spent a great deal of time studying fact and opinion on the subject. The American military presence below the 38th-parallel boundary, he argues, "provides a dramatic example of an antiquated commitment kept alive only by the artificial life support of political elites in their respective nations' capitals." With its high-growth gross national product, an estimated 18 times larger than the North's, South Korea should be big and strong enough to handle the North Koreans on its own.
Cold war conditions may once have justified a strong American security presence in Korea, Japan and elsewhere in the region, but the world has changed, Mr. Bandow insists, and yesterday's security assets are today's "fiscal black holes." Military outlays in Asia cost Americans $40 billion annually, while saving defense money for Asian allies who are also our economic competitors. Even if Kim Jong Il's troops invaded the South, they would pose "no credible military threat" to the United States.
But withdrawal from Korea -- and then Japan -- is only the beginning for Mr. Bandow. With the Soviet threat gone, he advocates abandoning a "globalist foreign policy" that badly distorts the American political system by "encouraging the growth of a large, expensive, repressive, secretive and often uncontrolled state." Instead, he wants a new military strategy of what he calls "benign detachment."
"Lace-curtain Buchananism" might be a better phrase for it. Like the redoubtable Pat, Mr. Bandow wants to build up Fortress America now that the Russians (maybe) are gone. Yet in treating our military role in Asia as a transitory cold war phenomenon, he overlooks the fact that the United States has been a Pacific power since the days of Commodore Perry and Admiral Dewey. However much we may talk about the primacy of economics, American power remains the ultimate guarantor of Pacific Basin prosperity.
In discussing Korea, for example, Mr. Bandow hugely underestimates the catastrophe for the region that would result from a North Korean attack on Seoul, even assuming that the good guys win in the end. He also neglects to inform us that Seoul's exposed border location resulted from an American -- not a Korean -- political decision to refrain from pushing the cease-fire line another 40 or 50 miles up to the narrow waist of the peninsula. This the United Nations forces could have accomplished in 1951 or 1952, after the Chinese advance had been turned back. But that was before the Republican Presidential candidate, Dwight D. Eisenhower, told the voters that a Republican Administration would make peace in Korea, come what may, after the 1952 election. (George Bush's failure to press the gulf war advantage had ample precedent.)
Mr. Bandow may trip over his own wire on the here and now of Korea, but he makes a great many other points worthy of attention. He rightly reminds us that despite sweeping changes in East Asia's economy and politics, "America's troop deployments . . . seem set in concrete." Asian countries are not American military protectorates. They make up their own minds, and their voters can get quite angry. Fifty years after the end of World War II, almost half of Okinawa's land is still an off-limits preserve of the American military -- and one bitterly resented. For their part, Seoul residents have long tired of the booze-and-bar-girl resorts of the Eighth Army in Itaewon.
CHANGES in Asia over the past half-century surely require a rethinking of our security needs. Sadly, this has yet to be done. Any new appraisal would no doubt be far from Mr. Bandow's total disengagement policy, but would certainly include drastic American troop redeployments, joint use of bases and a sharp reduction in exclusive military preserves. The antiquated cold war security treaties with both Japan and Korea would be replaced by the beginnings of a new regional security pact in which each country (Japan notably included) provides its share of the military muscle. Other countries might be invited to join -- including China, despite its current truculence. (After all, we once asked the Russians to join the Marshall Plan.) Yet a visible American presence must remain if we expect any such pact to work.
In Korea, the chances for an ultimate peaceful settlement, if not reunification of the sundered peninsula, are probably better now than they ever were, thanks to the near-bankrupt condition of the North, politically and economically. Pyongyang has few options left. When and if an agreement is reached, the great majority of the Eighth Army's troops in Korea should start packing. But not a moment before.

INSIDE THE KREMLIN'S COLD WAR
From Stalin to Khrushchev.
By Vladislav Zubok and Constantine Pleshakov.
Illustrated. 346 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press. $29.95.
For 40-odd years the cold war shaped American life. Then came Chernobyl, the breach in the Berlin wall and, in December 1991, the lowering of the hammer and sickle from the Kremlin. As Americans witnessed the other side's capitulation, hopes were kindled that newly released Soviet documents might finally resolve the nagging riddle of what had brought about the costly confrontation. Vladislav Zubok and Constantine Pleshakov have made one of the long-awaited forays into the Soviet archives. They emerge with "Inside the Kremlin's Cold War," an analysis that is constructed around a series of biographies and that hints at possible missed opportunities. 
 Mr. Zubok, a senior fellow at the National Security Archive in Washington, and Mr. Pleshakov, the director of the Pacific Studies Center at the Institute of U.S. and Canada Studies in Moscow, describe tantalizing memorandums prepared for Stalin during World War II by high-level Soviet diplomats. Internally, these specialists advocated not world conquest but a partnership with the United States and Britain to prevent Germany's resurgence and to assist in the Soviet Union's reconstruction. They also recommended exploiting the differences between the two capitalist powers. Examining Stalin's statements at Yalta and his subsequent actions in Turkey, Greece, Iran, China and Japan against the diplomats' memorandums, the authors surmise that the Soviet leader heeded his minions' advice. Stalin "wanted to avoid confrontation with the West," they suggest, because he "believed in the inevitability of a postwar economic crisis of the capitalist economy and of clashes within the capitalist camp that would provide him with a lot of space for geopolitical maneuvering in Europe and Asia -- all within the framework of general cooperation."
But in a belligerent speech in February 1946, Stalin seemed to reverse himself. With the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the stunning (for Stalin) election defeat of Winston Churchill, the Soviet leader had lost the partners whose company made him feel respected. Even then, documents indicate, Stalin almost reached a modus vivendi with Harry Truman at Potsdam. Between deliberations, however, Truman dropped word about the successful test of a new bomb, which he soon exploded at Hiroshima, aggravating the suspicious Stalin's fears of a double-cross.
Could the whole mess have been America's fault? It would seem that whatever its implications for the war with Japan, the bomb was used "at the worst possible moment" for relations with the Soviet Union. But the authors also assert that Russian imperialism and Marxist globalism "predestined" Soviet expansionism. They contend that Stalin's obsession with Alexander I's prominence during and after the Congress of Vienna in 1815, following the defeat of Napoleon by a coalition of nations, goaded him to preserve the coalition that subdued Hitler; at the same time they argue that Stalin's distrustfulness predestined him to a fallout with his capitalist confederates. No wonder American officials had trouble reading the situation. A declaration of cold war imposed a certain clarity and sense of mission, yet uncertainties persisted.
After Stalin died in 1953, two aspirants, Lavrenti Beria and Georgi Malenkov, favored moving away from ideology and global confrontation, according to Mr. Zubok and Mr. Pleshakov, precisely because, as overseers of the military-industrial complex, they understood the Soviet Union's vulnerabilities and the suicidal dangers of nuclear war. But Beria faced a firing squad and Malenkov lost a power struggle to Nikita Khrushchev, a romantic revolutionary who could not resist the summons to third-world liberation -- manifest in his attachment to Castro's Cuba. Khrushchev viewed this attachment as a revival of the promise of the Russian Revolution rather than an overreaching that sacrificed relations with the West and billions of rubles in exchange for grapefruit, beach vacations and elan. For Khrushchev much more than for Stalin, the authors say, Communist ideology proved to be a delusion.
Sketches of Vyacheslav Molotov, a ruthless defender of Soviet interests, and Andrei Zhdanov, a brutal ideologue out of the loop, fill in the book's focus on personalities. But readers may wonder whether individuals, even in a dictatorship, determine and implement policy as they see fit. Moreover, in puzzling through the minds behind the Kremlin's volatile mix of ideological proselytism and geopolitical pragmatism, the authors have relied at least as much on intuition as on new sources. That is because except for a few episodes -- the onset of the Korean War, revolts in Eastern Europe -- the decisive documents, including the working papers of the Politburo and Stalin's immense personal archive, remain under lock and key. Declassified second-tier materials illuminate policy making inside the Foreign Ministry, but cast predominantly indirect light on the Soviet leadership's aims and motivations.
A mostly engaging pastiche, this book can perhaps best be appreciated as unwitting testimony on Communism's collapse. When Mr. Zubok and Mr. Pleshakov observe that "the gallery of portraits of Soviet 'statesmen' in the cold war pales in comparison with the one of American and West European 'wise men,' " and that "there is no one on the Soviet side to praise," they betray the despair that gripped the former Soviet Union's educated elites. Both authors, baby boomers far removed from the Revolution, rose to coveted posts at a prestigious yet "infinitely cynical think tank." Serving a system their superiors scorned, both defected intellectually before the final crisis struck. Now they are exorcising demons.
Mr. Zubok and Mr. Pleshakov topple Stalin from his statesman's pedestal. "Stalin's postwar foreign policy was more defensive, reactive and prudent than it was the fulfillment of a master plan," they conclude. "Yet instead of postponing a confrontation with the United States . . . he managed to draw closer to it with every step," bequeathing an unbearable burden. In the book's last line, the authors proclaim that the nightmare has ended, that Stalin and his followers are dead and that the Kremlin will never again pursue revolutionary imperialism. But if the still-enigmatic cold war has taught anything, it is that the course of Russian foreign policy does not depend on Russia alone.

THE INHERITANCE
How Three Families and America Moved From Roosevelt to Reagan and Beyond.
By Samuel G. Freedman.
Illustrated. 464 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $27.50.
IN his State of the Union address on Jan. 23, President Clinton proclaimed, "The era of big government is over." This announcement, according to Samuel G. Freedman, acknowledged "the profound political transformation wrought by conservative Republicans. So drastically have politicians from Goldwater to Reagan to Gingrich shifted the electoral center to the right that in both of Clinton's Presidential campaigns the Democrat has sought to appropriate traditionally Republican issues and rhetoric." Mr. Freedman's purpose in "The Inheritance: How Three Families and America Moved From Roosevelt to Reagan and Beyond," a fascinating and occasionally frustrating book, is to explain how and why this "rise and fall" of the "New Deal dynasty" occurred. 
 The New Deal coalition that dominated American politics for nearly half a century fused the one-party white-supremacist South awkwardly and incongruously with a Northern blend of patrician elites, labor unions, Roman Catholics, Jews and African-Americans. The coalition's downfall resulted from the mass exodus of Southern whites and Catholics from Irish, Italian and Polish backgrounds. It is the Catholic defection that most interests Mr. Freedman, whose last book was "Upon This Rock: The Miracles of a Black Church." In 1980, a majority of Catholic voters cast Republican Presidential ballots. And in 1994, a majority of Catholics voted Republican in a Congressional election for the first time. Catholics accounted for one-third of the total vote in 1994 while constituting less than one-quarter of the population. "The Catholic exodus from the New Deal coalition," Mr. Freedman writes, "has now reshaped Congress."
The author's vehicle for tracing this transformation is a narrative of three families over three generations, from the time Al Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt were prominent in New York State politics to the time of Alfonse D'Amato and George Pataki. Each family -- one Irish, one Italian and one Polish -- clawed its way up from immigrant tenements in New York and Baltimore or wrong-side-of-the tracks cottages in New Rochelle and Ossining to suburbs, college and respectability by the third generation. The first-generation progenitors were a plumber, a domestic and a numbers runner. Three of their grandchildren met in the 1970's at the State University of New York, Albany, where they were active in Republican politics, heading for careers as a campaign manager, election lawyer and fund-raiser. With parents and grandparents of unshakable Democratic loyalty, these three -- Tim Carey, Frank Trotta and Leslie Maeby (whose grandfather was named Joseph Obrycki) -- became part of the New Right of the 70's.
Mr. Freedman interweaves their stories with incisive analyses of political campaigns, mainly in New York State. The reader follows the first two generations through the precarious prosperity of the 20's and the devastating poverty of the 30's, when emergency relief, the W.P.A. and Franklin Roosevelt were the only things that warded off starvation and despair. World War II, the G.I. Bill and the postwar economic boom set them back on their feet, still loyal Democrats. But by the 60's and 70's the third generation had broken the mold.
What happened? In a few words: a backlash against the extremes of the civil rights movement and against the countercultural opposition to the Vietnam War. Brought up in families that professed a strong work ethic, self-help, sexual restraint and marital responsibility, and a meritocracy of achievement, these third-generation white Americans reacted in shock and anger to race riots, black power, affirmative action, "welfare queens," limousine liberals who supported busing to achieve racial balance and sent their own children to private schools, antiwar protesters safe in their college exemptions from the draft who burned the American flag that had meant freedom and opportunity to their grandparents.
Frank Trotta worked part time all through high school, where he graduated as valedictorian, and worked to put himself through college at SUNY Albany, where he saw minority students on full scholarship who seemed to have more money and leisure time than he did. He wondered, Mr. Freedman writes: "In a college devoted to meritocracy, why did his own merit languish unrewarded?" In 1967, as a 20-year-old draftee, Tim Carey helped guard the Pentagon against assaults by antiwar protesters from Yale, Amherst and other bastions of privilege. "He could barely contain the disbelief, the near hatred, that those fortunate sons should attack American soldiers, should attack him, for bearing the burden they shirked." When they looked at the political system, these young people perceived the Democrats as coddling blacks and hippie anarchists. America had made a wrong turn. So they became Republicans.
Much of this is a well-known tale. But Mr. Freedman gives it a human face in richly detailed life stories with empathy for all sides in this complex human and political drama. There is no cheap condemnation of "racism" here; there is a sympathetic understanding of the social forces that drove the civil rights and antiwar movements to excess. There is also a finely honed sense of irony. Many of those who turned against welfare in the 70's had parents or grandparents who got through the Depression only with the help of relief and the W.P.A. Those in the third generation who deplored "big government" and voted for Ronald Reagan came from families that could not have moved to the suburbs and bought a house without the Federal highway program, the G.I. Bill and Veterans Administration mortgages.
The very richness of detail in "The Inheritance," however, carries some liabilities. The narrative is often disjointed, jumping from one family to another and backward or forward in time by a decade or more. So many uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins and in-laws enter the story by the second and third generations that the cast resembles the Admiralty in "H.M.S. Pinafore." The reader needs a scorecard to tell the players; indeed, a scorecard in the form of genealogical tables or family trees would have been a valuable addition.
One substantive omission from "The Inheritance" is any discussion of the gender gap. The existence of such a gap is implicit in Mr. Freedman's narrative. Although one of these third-generation new Republicans (Leslie Maeby) is a woman, the female relatives in the story are more likely than the men to remain Democrats. White male anger clearly played an important part in the transition analyzed here, while women were less affected by events that caused this anger. Yet there is no discussion -- indeed not even a mention -- of this significant distinction.
Another omission is perhaps equally important. In his foreword, Mr. Freedman promises to show how the Catholics represented by these three families "made and unmade the Democratic majority." He has fulfilled that promise -- for the suburbs and urban neighborhoods in the North where these groups mostly live and vote. But what of the South? The book contains two or three passing references to the Sun Belt but virtually nothing about the Old South. Yet that region is the main locus of Reagan Democrats and the Gingrich revolution. For three-quarters of a century the South was solid for the Democrats. Now it is almost as solid for the Republicans. That is the real story of the making and unmaking of the Democratic majority.
Samuel Freedman would probably acknowledge as much, but would insist that a reviewer should review the book he wrote, not a book he didn't write. I agree, and I salute the timely, incisive and engrossing book he has written. But the reader should be aware that in this account of three emblematic families and "their estrangement from the welfare state that once had sustained them," "The Inheritance" does not tell the whole story of how "America moved from Roosevelt to Reagan and beyond."

ABOUT SCHMIDT
By Louis Begley.
274 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $23.
Some of Western literature's most resonant works, including "King Lear" and Henry James's novel "The Spoils of Poynton," concern the transfer of property from one generation to the next. The issues raised by inheritance -- the limits to love between parents and children, the fading but still formidable power of the parents, the almost inevitable ingratitude of the children as they pursue their own goals, the new alliances and potential betrayals involved in any marriage -- touch all of us, whether we have a kingdom or splendid British country house to pass on or only some precious, albeit worthless, family tchotchkes. In Louis Begley's fine new novel, "About Schmidt," the property at issue is a house in the Hamptons, and although most readers might salivate at the prospect of owning such a house, inherited by Albert Schmidt from his wife's maiden aunt, his daughter -- wouldn't you know? -- would rather spend her weekends upstate, and her fiance worries about the upkeep. Schmidt is a buttoned-up, emotionally deprived man who has recently lost his wife, Mary, on whom he depended for his social life. A meticulous corporate lawyer, known for drafting elegant contracts, he retired early in order to care for her in her final illness. Now he is lonely, adrift and at odds with his only child, Charlotte, who, in addition to having bewilderingly turned into a yuppie he can't completely like (she does public relations on behalf of tobacco companies), has announced that she will marry a man he completely dislikes, a partner in Schmidt's firm -- a nerd, a bankruptcy maven, a Jew. For yes, even though his best friend is Jewish and considers his anti-Semitism "innocuous, one might almost say irrelevant," "Schmidtie" is an anti-Semite. 
 Mr. Begley is too fastidious to make Schmidt likable, as though to elicit sympathy for him would then be too easy. How much greater the literary accomplishment to make us pity, understand, even identify with someone we have permission to write off.
 Mr. Begley, who is a lawyer as well as a novelist, made his stunning literary debut with "Wartime Lies," a novel about a Jewish boy hiding from the Nazis, passing for Christian. This new novel could be called "Peacetime Truths," not only for the way it touches on "innocuous" anti-Semitism but because its protagonist is "an odd stickler for the truth," who, for example, feeling no affection for his prospective son-in-law, makes no pretense of affection in the slightest degree, even to the young man's mother. Whereas "Wartime Lies" explored duplicity and imposture, "About Schmidt" presents a determined search for accuracy in emotion, as the widower and retiree moves into a new phase of life, the last.
 Much as he wants to think that he is acting out of generosity in transferring his life interest in the Bridgehampton house to his daughter as a wedding present, Schmidt has to admit to himself that it is done partly "to avoid the duty I would feel to treat my married daughter and her husband as co-owners." So: the selfishness within generosity, the distaste mingled with parental love, the promiscuity that coexists with the deepest marital devotion. "About Schmidt" gets at them all.
 Sometimes the truth-telling can be hard to take, like this, on women's aging: "It seemed to Schmidt that loss of the ability to attract was an affliction as generalized among his female coevals as thinness of hair, the sclera and teeth turned yellow, sour breath, flaccidity or gigantism of breasts, midriffs gone soft and distended by wind, brown blotches and deltas of minute angry veins around the knee and on the calf, disastrous, swollen toes verging on deformity displayed in sandals or throbbing in the prison of black pumps. To tease Mary, he used to tell her what, in fact, he thought was the truth: that his own loss of libido, from the effects of which she was exempt . . . had less to do with his own aging than with the aging of the women around him."
 (It's a minor flaw in the novel that Schmidt, at 60, seems too young to be carrying on so about age, and too old -- the same goes for his Jewish film-maker pal and quondam college roommate -- to be so attractive to women in their 20's. If their young girlfriends exist to prove these men aren't as old as they think, it doesn't work. One geriophilic young woman per novel might be credible. Not two.)
 Whatever you think of him, Schmidt is remarkable for his clarity of mind. Why, he asks himself, should he give up alcohol, tobacco, cheese, red meat and eggs, for the sake of a longevity whose pleasures were unknown? As it was, "it seemed reasonable to stick to his agreeable, life-shortening habits, perhaps even to acquire new ones." In a crucial scene, Charlotte, on the telephone, distressed at feeling she has to reject both the wedding party and the house her father has been offering, attacks him, saying that according to her fiance, Schmidt's whole firm had considered him an anti-Semite. In a peacemaking effort, her mother-in-law-to-be, a psychiatrist, calls Schmidt to explain that Charlotte's inappropriate aggressive behavior had been caused by her guilt. But Schmidt only wants to know: did her aggressiveness consist of telling the truth or telling a lie? Did his partners really consider him anti-Semitic?
 This book exists at a point where the dry probity of a certain high-WASP temperament and the dry secular spirit in Judaism meet. It resolutely refuses transcendence. The temperature never goes up. The pitch never varies. You never feel you are being manipulated into a falsely emotional response. You can trust it as you trust a well-wrought contract: it keeps its affect entirely under control. It never tries to mean more than it says -- in fact, tries strenuously not to. This, to me, is the great pleasure of reading Louis Begley. His exceptional literary intelligence is always in control, making me wonder if more novelists shouldn't develop the virtues of lawyers as writers: accuracy, economy, abjuring the language of emotion.
 Quietly, the novel gains power as it continues. A deep underlying pessimism comes more often to the surface. "All lives end badly," Schmidt believes, and if a certain couple seems happy, it's because their lives "had not yet been broken. Their time would come." Ultimately, all books about inheritance are about Heraclitean flow. The river of life moves on. Things change. Poynton burns. The Hamptons aren't what they used to be. People we expect to die don't, and those we don't expect to die do. Wills reveal intentions we never suspected. Schmidt's new woman is a Puerto Rican waitress younger than his daughter. And so unpredictable is the current that things end well for him. The final events of the novel remind us, cleverly and wisely, that every older generation was once a younger generation, that every generation, no matter how loving or beloved, by its very existence poses problems for the generation, parental or filial, with which it is inextricably linked.
 Consistently subtle and intelligent, this novel ends by getting under your skin despite the unlikability of its protagonist. You are left with the feeling of having found out the complex truth behind the impeccable facade of someone you might never notice if you met him at a party -- someone, on the other hand, you might just know or be, an ordinary person with ordinary problems, even if he does have a retirement income of some $330,000 a year.

HEADLINE: Balloons and Baskets, Riders on the Wind

BYLINE: By BILL SLOCUM 

 BODY:
IT was another miserable morning in Plainville. The fog was thick and close to the ground. At Norton Park, several hundred sleepy-eyed spectators watched anxiously as a score of gaudily-colored canvas mastodons stood motionless, waiting for the sky to clear.
Robert Zirpolo had waited long enough. The morning before, just like this day, he had awakened before dawn and driven from his home in Cheshire in his van, the one with the license plate reading "AIRHED," only to have an unseasonable drizzle ruin his plans. There was no precipitation this time, just the mist, spread out in all directions as far as the eye could see. The flight ceiling was estimated at 200 feet. 
 That would have to do. Mr. Zirpolo beckoned his passengers into the basket where he stood, while he pumped hundreds of B.T.U.'s worth of energy into the balloon, a canvas envelope above him, by tugging on twin propane-fueled burners just above his head. Huge jets of flame shot into the mouth of the envelope until the basket began to rise.
The flight lasted 15 minutes, and the craft ascended a mere 600 feet. That was sufficient to get above the fog, but also to lose sight of all land features save the ridgeline of Meriden Mountain, poking out of the cottony vapor like Everest's peak. "It's all mashed potatoes up here," Mr. Zirpolo grumbled before making a landing near an empty parking lot. As soon as the basket was back on its trailer and the canvas envelope bound up inside the van, Mr. Zirpolo was zooming off, in search of propane fuel for another run. Like politicians, balloonists make a living riding ever-shifting winds and making a lot of hot air. Occasionally they too can get lost in the clouds. Finally, inevitably, they come to earth, except in the case of balloonists, this is done intentionally, at least most of the time.
Ballooning is a tough avocation in Connecticut. The long coastline, rolling hills, and woodland expanses all play havoc with the plans of even the best pilots, as does the sprawl of urbanization. Finding a safe place to land amid power lines and condominium complexes can be tricky.
Then there's Mother Nature. Mark Twain once observed that "one of the brightest gems in the New England weather is the dazzling uncertainty of it." Leo Tetreault, a balloonist from Manchester, concurs: "You have a hundred percent chance of weather every day."
That may be one reason why there are not a lot of balloonists in Connecticut. A definitive count is hard to get, but estimates vary between three to five dozen. Many of them are concentrated in central part of the state.
Despite their often competing to sell "champagne flights" -- aerial tours to paying customers that are the balloonist's main objective -- Connecticut balloon pilots seem a tight-knit group in settings like a rally. It is a brotherhood and sisterhood of rising before the sun, hunting down propane tankers, and savoring the exhilaration that arrives with watching the shadow of one's own craft blot the landscape 2,000 feet below.
This year has been a particularly good example of how a balloonist's life can be made miserable by the weather. A long, snowy winter belatedly gave way to a brief spring, and then a stormy summer. Balloonists console themselves by noting there is still fall, which while traditionally rainy is also the peak period for champagne flights. People come from other states to take in the majesty of Connecticut's foliage change from above.
"It's especially marvelous in a slow-moving craft, where you can get down in those leaves in a basket," said Kathy Wadsworth, a commercial pilot from Farmington. "Weatherwise, it's very tricky, but visually, it's spectacular."
Balloons are normally kept airborne for only an hour, and fly only several miles, so it's neither speed nor distance that the pilot is after. "It's the esthetics," said Mike Kirkwood, a pilot from Plainville. "They are colorful, and still mysterious to a lot of people." Flying them also carries its share of mystery. "You don't know where you're going to land, or who you're going to meet," he continued. "If you land on a street, the whole neighborhood might come out to greet you. It's a great way to meet people."
Balloons are at the mercy of the winds, which is one reason pre-dawn and late-afternoon launches are the rule. In the middle of the day, the sun heats up the ground and creates dangerous thermal pressures. The ideal balloon flight is a slow one, with plenty of time for sightseeing and a soft landing.
Tolerant landowners are also a boon. Most people in Connecticut tend to enjoy the spectacle of a balloon, even as it sets down on their property. Dale Martin, one of the Plainville firefighters who puts on the hot-air balloon festival there, said people in the area are receptive to balloons most of the time, even though they are a fairly common sight during weekends. "If a balloon lands in your backyard, it's an event."
Steve Ushchak, a carpenter and farmer from Cheshire who heads Mr. Zirpolo's chase crew, carries a map with him that delineates all the properties within a several-mile radius of a given spot. A few of these properties are marked in red, meaning their owners are known not to want balloons landing there.
He notes stories of landowners threatening balloonists with shotguns and even siccing a dog on an earthbound aviator, but he insists that is far from common. "One in a hundred will give you a hard time, and usually that guy is mad at the world."
While some might see ballooning as more spectacle than sport, those associated with the activity say there are actually two tests of ability going on simultaneously in a flight. There is the balloonist, who shifts altitudes seeking the right winds and, finally, a good landing site. Then there is the balloonist's chase crew, on the ground riding a van, trying to keep pace and trying to be where the balloon lands, when it lands.
Mr. Kirkwood got his start crewing for Mr. Zirpolo. "It's a good feeling when you get there ahead of the balloon," he said. "The sport is to get there at the same time without breaking any speed limits. You need to have knowledge of where the winds are going."
Most balloonists use special radios to keep in touch with their chase crews, although Mr. Tetreault said his own crew chief is so accustomed to his ways that radio contact is sometimes not necessary. "He thinks like me," Mr. Tetreault said.
Mr. Tetreault outfits his crew with attention-getting T-shirts emblazoned with the name of his balloon: "Yo Baby." Other crews are less conspicuous but just as dedicated. Like most crewpeople, Mr. Ushchak and his wife, Judith, are not paid for their work. Instead, Mr. Zirpolo is teaching Mr. Ushchak how to fly. "He also helps us with the hay in the spring," Mr. Ushchak said. "All the balloonists help, because we let them land in our field."
There are such things as balloon competitions. Each year, the Balloon Federation of America puts together a series of contests, mostly involving precision flying exercises like getting the closest to a standing pole or chasing another balloon. They culminate in the National Hot Air Balloon Championship, currently held in Missouri.
Other favored sites for B.F.A.-sanctioned competitions include Colorado and the West Coast, which helps explain why not many Connecticut balloonists are to be found there. Sharon Ripperger, a federation official, said she could find only eight balloonists from Connecticut registered with their competition division.
One of the few Connecticut balloonists who does actively compete is Paul Morlock of Newtown, a regular in the Nationals from 1984 to 1992 who once ranked among the top 100 balloonists in the nation. While he still managed a respectable showing earlier this year in Battle Creek, Mr. Morlock no longer competes regularly.
"I'd love to, but you have to have the money," he said. "Most of the biggest ones have sponsorships."
Another Connecticut balloonist who has received national recognition is Ms. Wadsworth. In the 1970's, she and her then-husband, Brian Boland, set several altitude and endurance records with the AX-1, the smallest balloon model with only 9,000 square feet of envelope capacity. While those records have since been broken, she notes they were among the first to experiment with the design, building a craft that, among other things, is easier to pack and unpack.
Like many other champagne flight providers in Connecticut, Ms. Wadsworth owns her own company, KAT Balloons, Inc. She has been doing it longer than most, however, 22 years.
"I like the idea of being able to get up in the sky from my backyard," she said. "It's the simplest form of flying. You can't want to go anywhere. You just got to accept the conditions. There are different elements that you are dealing with, and you've got to use them to your advantage. It's like a chess game."
There is little good money to be made in ballooning, its practitioners say. Economic and meteorological reasons are partially to blame, but so too is a glut in the market. Mike Bollea of Farmington noted there are 10 balloonists within a five-mile radius of him, and that most of them, like himself, are commercial.
"People price around," he said. "They might ask you 'How come this guy charges so much less than you?' You might say: 'I wouldn't go up with him, he's not safe.' "
Most commercial pilots tend to have second careers. Mr. Morlock is a builder, for example, while Mr. Tetreault works at the Post Office's vehicle maintenance center in Hartford.
Mr. Kirkwood is in video production. He used to work for ESPN, but quit in 1992 to fly across the United States in a balloon. An acrophobe who still gets uneasy climbing tall ladders, Mr. Kirkwood has soared as high as 18,000 feet in a balloon.
Bruce Byberg is a full-time commercial balloonist who is prospering. One reason is that he has the northeastern corner of the state, Tolland and Windham counties, virtually to himself. Another is that he has commercial sponsors. At Plainville, for example, he was on hand to give tethered rides to children in a balloon bearing the logo of the ReMax real estate agency.
The ReMax balloon is a familiar sight at balloon fairs and other state events, sort of Connecticut's poorer cousin to the Goodyear blimp. Mr. Byberg said as advertising, a balloon can be quite effective. "It's a very friendly way to get your name out there."
There are four major balloon fairs in the state. Next month, Mr. Byberg will be the balloonmeister at the last of them, the Windham Lighter Than Air Festival at Jillison Square in Windham, Oct. 18-20. Admittance is free, but donations will be solicited for the Hole in the Wall Gang camp in Ashford.
Mr. Byberg touted the Windham area as offering the best flying conditions in the state. Not only is there plenty of open farmland available for landings, he said, but the people there still get excited by balloons.
The people at Plainville seemed turned on, too, as the morning wore on and the heavy fog suddenly lifted. In a single moment, 20 balloons filled a blue sky, going toward all points of the compass as they hovered over the craning necks of adults and children alike.
"It's an amusement," Mr. Zirpolo said. "That's all it is. It's not of any use to anyone, except as an amusement. Hopefully it's as much for your amusement as for those you take up."

HEADLINE: Purchase College, the 25-Year-Old Experiment

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

DATELINE: PURCHASE

 BODY:
TWENTY-FIVE years ago this month, Purchase College officially opened during a downpour. The rain prevented 10 portable classrooms from being delivered to the unfinished campus, and the first entering class -- 170 third-year students who had transferred from other schools -- met under a tent.
Such plucky coping has been the school's chief mode of operation since 1973, when Nelson A. Rockefeller, whose vision of public higher education is embodied in this arts-oriented branch of the State University, left the Governor's office to become Vice President of the United States. State support dwindled almost immediately, and the college, like other branches of the university, is now struggling to fulfill its mission as a public-private hybrid. 
 Rockefeller was not only personally passionate about the arts -- serving as a trustee of both the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art -- but he also dared to establish a public college devoted to cultivating arts education at the highest level. He and the administrators he recruited went further than establishing performing arts conservatories and a visual arts faculty, to be buttressed in 1972 by the opening on campus of the Neuberger Museum of Art. They believed aspiring artists should be nurtured by the broad study of science and the humanities, and thus liberal arts became equally important at the school.
Ever since, debate has raged here about how truly to connect the various disciplines, so that economists might comfortably quote from Euripides and painters might find inspiration in Plato's cave. "If we could pull it off, it would be unique in higher education in the public sector, and maybe even in the private," said Bill Lacy, the college's current president. He added that the issue was constantly under discussion.
If Rockefeller did not draw up the marriage contract in detail, he did lay the groundwork for such fertile intermingling, said former college officials involved in the early planning stages of the school. "There's no question that it was his dream, but he had some real help," said John W. Straus, the first dean for administration and the arts. The person primarily responsible for carrying out the dream was the late Dr. Abbott Kaplan, who was recruited from his position as associate dean of the College of Fine Arts of the University of California at Los Angeles to become the first president of Purchase College. Dr. Kaplan also served as chairman of the California Arts Commission.
Dr. Frank W. Wadsworth, a literary scholar who was the first vice president for academic affairs, recently recalled what Dr. Kaplan asked of him in developing a liberal arts curriculum. "The goal," Dr. Wadsworth said, "was a first-rate college experience on a public campus, so people who couldn't go to the Harvards and Wellesleys could get a personalized and independent education. It was an innovative program with an emphasis on independent study in the broadest, most philosophical sense, so that students would take more responsibility for their education than in the usual undergraduate school."
Dr. Wadsworth, who also taught literature here until 1990, recalled the "wild-eyed, anti-everything" students of the early 1970's, whose generation lent spice to Rockefeller's remarks at a ground-breaking ceremony here in 1969: he applauded Dr. Kaplan's courage in taking on the job "at the regular salary, no combat pay."
Those living in the area were at first wary at the prospect of any wild-eyed rebels in their leafy neighborhood, given the roiling passions of antiwar demonstrators and student activists nationwide. Mr. Straus, who was also one of the first members of the Purchase College Foundation, recently recalled that people "were unhappy with the concept that we'd bring these 'crazy' students into the community."
But Strathglass Farm, a 500-acre farm devoted to raising prize-winning Ayrshire cattle, among other things, was being sold by its owner, the paper-manufacturing magnate Hugh Chisholm, and the neighbors decided that a college on the site would be preferable to a housing development, Mr. Straus recalled.
"People began to realize that it was a great opportunity, because there was so much open space left," Mr. Straus said. As designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, master architect of a team that also included Philip Johnson, Robert Venturi and others, the campus sprawls out of sight of Anderson Hill Road in angular patterns worthy of the painter Chirico.
Students strolling to class on a recent sunny afternoon softened the sharp-edged center mall, which is lined with maple trees and banners heralding the school's 25th anniversary.
The student body of 2,200 matriculating students is comprised of diverse ethnic groups, and faculty members say the racial mixture is one of the school's strong points. A continuing challenge, however, is the recruiting and retaining of students, Mr. Lacy said.
"We need to be a college of 6,000 students, and that's part of the growth plan for over the next five years," he said. "That's the number the academic planners built and designed the school for."
Students pay $10,400 a year in tuition, room and board if they are New York residents, and $15,300 a year if they are not.
In addition to its undergraduates, the college can also be measured by the strength of its contributions to the community. The place is a cultural magnet, drawing thousands a year to its four-theater complex, the Performing Arts Center; its division of Continuing Education and the Neuberger Museum.
Many travel weekly to events and classes on the campus, where Eugene McCarthy taught a history course in 1975, James Baldwin lectured in 1986 and young artists are forging paths to follow some of the school's stellar graduates. These include Wesley Snipes and Stanley Tucci, who graduated from the theater division in 1984 and 1982 respectively; Dwayne Croft of the Metropolitan Opera, who graduated from the music division in 1983 and Terese Capucilli, a 1978 graduate who was a principal dancer with the Martha Graham Company.
The college plans a series of celebratory events through next spring that will "cut across every academic program," said Margaret M. Sullivan, vice president for external affairs and development. She said all are free to the public, except lectures about Kykuit on Oct. 8 and Nov. 7 and a benefit performance and dinner to be held Nov. 18. The performance, which will take place at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center, will feature Mr. Tucci, Ms. Capucilli and other well-known graduates. The dinner will be held at Tavern on the Green. For ticket information, call (212) 935-1840.
Two exhibitions in honor of the anniversary will open today at the Neuberger Museum. These are "Urban Suburban: The Architecture of Purchase College," curated by Mr. Lacy and Susan de Menil, which runs through Jan. 19, and "25 Years of Visual Arts at Purchase," an alumni exhibition continuing through Jan. 5.
Two more events are planned next Sunday. The television personality Charlie Rose will lead a panel discussion at 1:30 P.M. in the Performing Arts Center called "The Vision of Nelson Rockefeller: A Multifaceted Perspective." Panelists will include Kitty Carlisle Hart, a former chairwoman of the New York State Council on the Arts, who was appointed by Rockefeller; Dr. Clifton Wharton Jr., former Chancellor of the State University of New York; Mr. Barnes, the architect; Joseph Persico, author of "The Imperial Rockefeller"; and Gerald Benjamin, director of the Center for New York State and Local Government Studies at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government. Tickets are free, but reservations are required. The number to call is 251-6200.
In addition, the exhibition "A Tribute to Nelson A. Rockefeller" will open next Sunday at 5 P.M. at the museum. Dr. Lisa Keller, an assistant professor of history here and director of the Institute for Westchester and Local History, said the exhibition, which she curated with the archivist Harold Oakhill, includes documents and photographs from the Rockefeller Archives, as well as selected paintings and sculptures from Rockefeller's art collection. This show also runs through Jan. 5.
In researching Rockefeller, Dr. Keller said, "I was surprised by the degree to which he was driven by the altruistic desire to do good regardless of the political ramifications."

HEADLINE: What's on the Internet? Here's a Start

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN 

 BODY:
DEBORAH GILBERT, the host of The Emerging Society, a call-in talk show simulcast on the Fairfield County News Radio, AM 1350, and on the Internet, speaks about cyberspace with sheer reverence. A seasoned talk-show host, she started using the communication tool last fall before starting her program, the first of its kind in Connecticut.
To prepare, she spent hours in chat rooms and in moderated chats from CNN, meeting people from all over the world and discussing everything from international politics to trivia. 
 What touched her more than anything else, she said, was the camaraderie on line. One man from Oklahoma she met during a chat session told her he was nervous because he'd accepted a job in New York City and had few contacts. Ms. Gilbert invited the man into a chat room with people from the New York area, who offered him housing leads and contacts, easing his anxiety about moving to the city.
Ms. Gilbert also recalled how last New Year's Eve, she stayed home nursing the flu, yet spent the evening on line hypertextlinking all over the world to wish people a happy New Year.
"That's one of the glories of chat and of the Internet," Ms. Gilbert said. "It's bringing people and information together in a democratic form. It's absolutely mindboggling."
Once a small society of computer wizards and academics, the Internet population has soared into the millions, as more and more people abandon their televisions and radios to seek entertainment, business and educational opportunities on line. Ms. Gilbert's talk program, which can be heard by downloading audio software (http://www.clubnetct.com) features local and national Internet experts whose range of topics include web site design, new on-line technology and Internet advertising.
The program illustrates both the technological advances of the Internet and the new wave of excitement over the medium's potential. Though observers note that Connecticut has not embraced the technology as vigorously as other states, particularly those in the West, signs of its steady growth are evident in the number of Connecticut-based web sites, Internet-related businesses, the popularity of chat services and on-line videoconferencing.
Next Saturday, Connecticut will also become one of the first states to connect hundreds of its schools and libraries to the Internet, in a project called Connect T96. The program enables schools and libraries to get high-speed wiring at a discount, modems to send and receive data via phone lines as well as access to Internet provider services.
The integration of the medium into more and more facets of American life, say observers, indicates that the ambivalence or dread of the last few years over the Internet's impact has to some degree subsided.
"The Internet mirrors and magnifies life around us in all of its diverse and perverse forms, which is why people react fearfully," says Terence Rogers, an Internet consultant from Greenwich, who has worked in the computer industry for 25 years. "Yet it is crystal clear that the Internet is important and is here to stay," he said.
Gloria Brown, a fourth and fifth grade teacher at Wakelee Elementary School in Wolcott, already uses the Internet in her classroom for student research projects and to communicate with other schools. Micro-Net, an Internet service provider in Waterbury, offers Wakelee and some 130 other schools in the state free access as well as a chat area and videoconferencing program for student use only. Ms. Brown says she leaves the computer on all day, allowing students to work on papers and E-mail pen pals in other states. "It's like having a library in the classroom," she said.
Despite its educational advantages, she said, she remains mindful of the dark side of the Internet and must emphasize to students to use the medium responsibly. "I still have my reservations about using it," she said. "With children you have to be so careful. You never know who you'll find out there."
Educators, or just the curious who want information about the state, will find thousands of Connecticut-based web sites on line. Probably the best places to start are with the so-called gateway web sites, which offer links to hundreds of other sites.
The State of Connecticut web site (http://www.state.ct.us/) provides access to information created by government agencies, with categories in the economy, environment, health, transportation and municipalities.
The Connecticut Guide site, supported by Atlantic Computing Technology Corporation in Newington (http://ctguide.atlantic.com/sites/ index.html), provides a link to 709 Connecticut sites from CERN, the particle laboratory in Geneva that created the World Wide Web. Listing a site is free. Visitors to CERN's collection can find everything from businesses and associations, to events, advice on automotive problems, kayak kits, head lice solutions and a medical information retrieval service.
The Connecticut Guide site also links visitors to the Connecticut Tourism Guide and to the Connecticut Library Home Page, which began as a senior project in computer science at Southern Connecticut State University. The site is an excellent launchpad to the state's educational, political, artistic and recreational resources.
Social contact and self-expression is another prevalent theme, as the graphics and text of many of Connecticut-based home pages illustrate. At the Ranting with Kenny site, visitors encounter an odyssey of doom and purple prose. "Outside the world screamed and splintered, and animals cooked to the bone in the incredible meltdown," the site's author says in a fictional diary excerpt. "Fortunately or not, I was less than an animal. I thrived on the ghastly heat, thrashing in the boiling muck."
On the lighter side, the Hauserman family's home page includes click-on's to Paul's, Patti's, Amanda's and Gregory's pages plus family news and the Hauserman's favorite recipes.
Jason M. Card tells visitors to his site that he is 24 and works in the marketing department of a "big-time" health insurance company. Just as most web sites do, Mr. Card's displays a few of his favorite links like the Mutant Page, the Looney Tunes page, and the Ozzy Osborne page.
At Kerry Lynn Torello's web site (http://www.connix.com/Kerry/ #index) browsers discover she's a veteran Internet user and enthusiast, that she loves rock and roll, shooting pool, taking shots of Tequila and riding Harley-Davidson motorcycles topless. In real life, Ms. Torello is a telecommuter for Digital Equipment Corporation headquartered in Maynard, Mass., where she is a software support specialist.
In a recent telephone interview, Ms. Torello said she designed her own web page for fun and for business. The site provides a link to her husband's company, Quality Graphics and Marketing, which maintains the web site for the Connecticut Lottery (http://www.qqm.com/ ctlott.html).
Ms. Torello began using the Internet as a social tool in 1993, while living in Colorado Springs. During an encounter inside an America Online chat room, she met her future husband, Gary, who lived in Connecticut. Through their conversations, Ms. Torello said, they drew closer and eventually met. In February of last year she moved to Haddam to live with Mr. Torello. The couple married later that spring.
Somewhat of a chat specialist, Ms. Torello warns that finding love on the Internet isn't for everybody, and that weboholics are plentiful. "It's very easy to get sucked in because a relationship on the Internet becomes so intense and heartfelt," she said. "Unlike day to day encounters you can be as uninhibited as you want, which can give you a false since of intimacy. It may be a fascinating communication tool, but people have to remember it doesn't reflect real life."
She added that for many, the Internet fills a void in their lives, particularly in an era where work and family demands overshadow social relationships. "People are aching to socialize," she said. "And the Internet is easily accessible. You don't have to brush your teeth or even get dressed to participate."
The visual equivalent of the Internet chat rooms, CU-SeeME, allows video conferences over the Internet. The set-up combines CU-SeeME software, which can be downloaded at no cost from Cornell University and a black and white digital camera for about $100. Once in place, users can communicate with other people anywhere in the world. The software supports up to eight windows to other parties on a computer screen. A version that includes audio was released last year. Transmissions occur out of reflector sites, computer servers that act as small digital television stations.
Kevin Wolfthal, who coordinates photographic services at Fairfield University, has used the Internet for cultivating professional and social contacts. He started using CU-SeeME at home earlier this year after several years of communicating with friends and colleagues through chat rooms and newsgroups.
"The difference was amazing," he said, about the first time he used the program. "All of the sudden these images started coming up on my computer screen. It was really wonderful to see people's gestures and expressions."
Since then, Mr. Wolfthal has met people across the country, from graphic designers and researchers to schoolteachers and college students. One of the more famous personalities is named Batwoman, an Internet socialite who throws get-togethers for CU-SeeME users around the country. Another user named Jae is from Portland, Ore. where she's planning on opening an Internet cafe.
The CU-SeeME culture comes with its own slang. For example, lurkers are users who don't show themselves on camera, yet watch everyone else. DC-ing is when two people break away from the pack to have a one-to-one conference.
In many ways, Mr. Wolfthal said, CU-SeeME enhances the quality of on-line communication because it takes away some of the wariness a user might have with text-only meetings. "With CU-SeeME it's easier to establish trust," he said. "Whereas on commercial services there's a lot of flaming. You never know who's getting on or what his or her agenda is." (Flaming is communication perceived as hostile or rude.)
Nevertheless, video conferencing breeds its share of bad taste. Users have been known to expose themselves on camera and to make obscene gestures. "It's unbelievable what people will do," Mr. Wolfthal said.
Much of the on-line video conferencing is taking place on college campuses and in the swell of Internet cafes. Charles Wilhelm, the owner of the Online Cafe in Norwalk, which became the first of its kind to open in the state to open last fall, said the cafe attracts business people, researchers and those who use the Internet for entertainment and recreation. The cafe sells coffee and pastry and supports its own T-1 reflector site for CU-SeeME, allowing users to get images faster and sharper than with a personal modem.
A former publisher, Mr. Wilhelm said the Internet's advances in the realm of audio and video pose a serious threat to television and even the telephone, yet the medium will not become a household staple until it expands its local information capabilities. "One day soon," he said, "you're going to wake up and be able to check your local weather, see the school lunch menu, check the time of the P.T.O. meeting and even see if the local hardware store carries a certain product. People will cozy up to the Internet even more when they see how it can improve their lives and their communities."
Mr. Rogers, the Greenwich Internet consultant, agrees, pointing out the already growing number of web sites supported by towns and cities around the state and others that offer links to several communities. He added that once the Internet develops a financial approach, where information is perhaps supported either through donations or through advertising, the on-line content will improve as will the medium's overall usefulness.
"Right now you're either astonished or disappointed when you use the Internet, which is a sign of its immaturity," he said. "But once an economic plan is applied, the boring and faddish stuff should fade and the more interesting and important information will grow and grow."

HEADLINE: Another View Of a Store's Fate

 BODY:
In reference to your article, ("Pride in State and Family, Trying for a Sound Economic Base," Aug. 11):
As a person who grew up in the Waterbury area, I have fond memories of shopping with my mother at Howland-Hughes. But as a young reporter at The Waterbury Republican in the late 1960's, I was shocked, disheartened and then outraged when the late Morris Paine was successful as the prime force behind the demolition of the Buckley Building, a magnificent structure designed by Stanford White, so that a downtown parking garage could be built to accommodate shoppers at Howland-Hughes. 
 Mr. Paine accomplished this in his capacity as chairman of Waterbury's Parking Authority over the objections of people who tried to save the building by promoting alternative ways to provide additional parking.
Mr. Paine was concerned only with the short-sighted interest of his own store, with no consideration for the preservation and potential adaptive re-use of what was undoubtedly the most beautiful building in all of Waterbury.
The parking garage that was built on that site is absolutely soul-less, one of the ugliest buildings I've ever seen.
It's ironic that business declined at Howland-Hughes in the decades after the garage was built and equally ironic that Mr. Paine's son, Hank Paine, is now promoting Connecticut's heritage.

HEADLINE: SCHOLARSHIPS FOR THE RICH

 BODY:
The two cases Andrew Delbanco uses to illustrate the impact of financial aid in college admissions oversimplify a complex process ("Scholarships for the Rich," Sept. 1). 
 Attractive scholarships notwithstanding, might not Kevin Seal have chosen Indiana over Columbia because he wanted to cheer for Bobby Knight's Hoosiers as well as receive a high-quality education? Might not Nikia Scott have found at a historically black institution like Howard a campus environment that Columbia could not provide? Such subjective factors enter into the decisions 18-year-olds make when they select colleges. And for many, the presumed reputation and influence of the Ivy League may be far less important than Delbanco thinks.

Home Buyers Move Cautiously Back Into the Market

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
AS the economy and job market improve so does New Jersey's housing outlook as once-hesitant buyers tiptoe back into the residential market, which had fallen into the doldrums last winter.
Sales of existing homes are better than they were this time last year and new home purchases are holding their own even though new construction remains sluggish. And the impact of last year's corporate downsizings, especially AT&T's announcement that it would lay off 7,000 employees in New Jersey, turned out to be less harsh than expected. As a result a sense of relief has returned to the market, real estate professionals said. 
 But what makes the market's improvement exceptional, they add, is that it came despite the fact that mortgage interest rates are higher than they were at the start of the year.
Assessing the situation, James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said: "For consumers the tug of war has been mortgage interest rates versus the health of the economy, and so far the economy has won out."
Projections are that the market will continue its modest rebound through the end of the year.
At the same time, new-home construction remains on a "declining path," said Patrick O'Keefe, executive vice president of the New Jersey Builders Association in Plainsboro.
Overall demand "is not explosive, but it is trucking along and prices are stable," said Niels Guldbjerg, vice president at the Otteau Appraisal Group, a real estate consulting firm in East Brunswick. David Schoner, vice president of the New Homes Division, New York metropolitan region, at Coldwell Banker, a real estate brokerage with national headquarters in Short Hills, called demand "spotty."
Despite the market's new optimism, buyers remain cautious. People will buy if they perceive value and realistically priced houses will sell, said Michael Ford, president-elect of the New Jersey Association of Realtors in Edison.
The active markets were, and will be, communities that offer good schools and hold their appreciation, said Mr. Schoner, noting that the appeal was still location,
As sales of existing homes in the first half of this year rose 8.8 percent from the same period in 1995 -- from 67,800 to 73,800, said the realtors' group -- so did the median home price, which rose to $152,100 from $146,500. The state's median household income also increased -- from $54,000 to $57,400.
About 22 percent of the sales were for homes priced from $100,000 to $140,000 and 19.8 percent were for homes costing $200,000 to $300,000, indicating that the sales activity had spread from first-time purchasers to move-up buyers, said Peter Mosca, spokesman for the realtors' association.
THOUGH the market for resale homes priced above $300,000 was weak, developers of new homes in that category report good sales. One is Toll Brothers of Huntington Valley Pa., which has 34 communities ticketed for a total of 3,822 homes in various stages of construction. Most are in the $300,000 to $500,000 range.
In the first half of this year 379 homes were sold at an average price of $387,000, compared with 215 homes at an average price of $361,00 in the first six months of 1995.
But move-up buyers like Steven and Mary Cooper predominate. After holding off buying a home because of concerns over job security the couple, both in their 30's and the parents of two children, decided last fall to move from their town house in Tinton Falls to a $260,000 four-bedroom house at a subdivision being built in Howell Township.
"We ran out of space, were finally in a position to afford a larger home and reached a point that we couldn't live our lives being afraid," said Mr. Cooper. He is a sales manager working from his home for Timberland, the New-Hampshire-based footwear and clothing company; she is a part-time dental assistant.
So with mortgage rates higher but still reasonable "we felt buying a home was a chance worth taking," said Mr. Cooper. He said he and his wife chose a corner lot and worked with the developer, Christopher Stephen Homes, of Wall Township, to keep the cost of the house within their reach. The couple sold their town house for $126,000, $14,000 less than they had paid, and moved into the bigger house this month.
In terms of demographics, move-up buyers, mostly maturing baby boomers with children -- which Dean Hughes said represented one of every three New Jerseyans -- will continue to be a market focus. And industry professionals are betting that more of them will react as the Coopers did and buy.
The professionals feel that this will keep sales moving through the fall and winter, enabling the market not only to finish the year ahead of 1995 but to match 1994, when the state reached its highest level of sales since 1987.
What will keep the market on a steady course, most experts agree, is job growth. Dean Hughes said the state was expected to gain 46,000 jobs in 1996, against the 33,000 it added last year. As long as mortgage rates stay reasonable (they went from a low of 7.24 percent in February to 8.5 percent earlier this month) the market should come close to 1994 levels, said Dean Hughes.
Keith T. Gumbinger, vice president at HSH Associates, a Butler firm that tracks mortgage activity, said he expected rates "to hover around the 8.5 percent mark through year's end." He said the higher rate was mitigated by the wide variety of mortgages lenders are offering, such as the assortment of adjustable-rate loans and those with 3 percent down.
BUT concern persists over new-home construction. Through June the state issued 8,558 building permits, down from 9,705 the same time last year. Mr. O'Keefe of the Builders Association said that the decline would accelerate in the second half of this year and beyond as developers run out of approved projects.
Mr. Mosca said his group estimated that 146,000 existing homes would be sold in 1996, compared with 138,300 in 1995 and 145,400 in 1994.
"Attendance at our open houses is up 30 percent, indicating a strong finish to 1996," said Jacelyn L. Botti, regional vice president at Weichert Realtors, the state's largest broker. She said her company had 18 percent more signed contracts for new and resale homes in the first half of the year than the 14,379 signed in the same period last year.
While Mr. O'Keefe said demand for homes priced from $100,000 to $150,000 was strong, the state's long approval process and limited land for small lots makes building them difficult.
But Continental Properties of Brick has been able to respond. It is building detached homes on small lots at the Estates at Sailor's Quay, an 81-home project in Brick Township in Ocean County, where land is available at reasonable costs.
The homes range in size from 1,500 to 2,100 square feet and in price from $125,000 to $165,000. Sales opened earlier this month and 150 people showed up, said Steven Fisch, a principal at Continental. "I'm optimistic," he added.
So is Gabriel M. Pasquale, director of marketing for K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, the state's largest developer, which continues to focus on town houses and detached single-family homes for entry-level and move-up buyers.
He said while sales were down 3 percent the first half of this year against the same time last year "traffic is significantly up, showing strong interest."
As proof he pointed to Woodcliff at Marlboro, containing 286 homes ranging in size from 1,860 square feet to just under 3,000. The community opened two weeks ago in Marlboro and 35 homes priced in the $190,000 to mid-$200,000's range were sold, he said.
Toll, which saw success with projects this year aimed at second- and third-time move-up buyers also sees the activity continuing, said Douglas C. Yearley Jr., a vice president. "For these buyers it is not an affordability issue, but a matter of confidence, which is returning," he said.

Perseverance Pays Off for Developer in Mamaroneck

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

DATELINE: MAMARONECK

 BODY:
THE Westchester County landscape is littered with the detritus of failed development projects, both residential and commercial. Some have fallen due to the financial collapse, for whatever reason, of the developer. But several have never gotten off the ground due to vociferous local opposition.
It is not uncommon these days for an approval process to take the better part of a decade. During that time, a project can change hands several times. And it is rare that a developer is able to hang in and fight City Hall, as it were, for that length of time. 
 But that is what happened to Howard Loewentheil, who on Wednesday will celebrate the opening of a 39-unit moderate-income condominium project that had its beginnings almost exactly nine years ago.
The finished product, called Continental View, is not exactly what Mr. Loewentheil envisioned when he purchased 50,000 square feet of property on East Boston Post Road on Oct. 25, 1987.
At the time he foresaw a luxury townhouse condominium development with a swimming pool, where the units would cost $400,000 to $500,000. But it wasn't meant to be.
His property happens to border a neighborhood of turn-of-the-century homes and a prewar apartment building, and the residents there vigorously opposed the proposed development from the start.
"When we heard about it, we said no way this is going to happen," said Morton Heilman, past president of the Stuart Avenue Association. The neighborhood group took the village to court, charging that it had improperly granted a variance to build a town-house complex in a zone where only single-family homes were permitted. And it won.
"For the next four to five years, it was like the Israelis and the Iraqis," Mr. Loewentheil said. "No matter what we proposed they didn't want it. Something was always wrong. Basically they wanted to turn it into a park. But when you spend over $1 million for a piece of property, that's not going to happen."
For his part, Mr. Heilman doesn't really dispute the developer's characterization of the opposition. "I guess the best thing that could have happened is if he walked away," he said. "We just didn't want a residential project there with 100 more people in the neighborhood all walking their dogs on Stuart Avenue."
Eventually, "after about seven or eight years, it became clear that something was going to go in there," Mr. Heilman said, "so a compromise was in order."
THE intervening years changed the nature of the development considerably. The market for luxury condominiums had dried up and Mr. Loewentheil opted instead for moderate-income units.
The units range in size from two-bedroom, two-bath condominiums that also have a den to a single one-bedroom unit. "The village made us include a one-bedroom," Mr. Loewentheil said. Prices range from $139,900 for the one-bedroom unit to $152,000 to $179,000 for the two-bedroom ones.
So far, 37 units have sold, Mr. Loewentheil said, mostly to people who already live or work in Mamaroneck. "We have an agreement with the village to sell to village residents and employees first," Mr. Loewentheil said.
Ann Worthy, one of the buyers, was ecstatic about the project finally being completed. "This past winter, I shoveled out my last driveway," she said. "I needed to be released from the responsibilities of a house."
She and her elderly father will soon move into a large two-bedroom apartment at Continental View. "If this hadn't happened, I probably would have had to leave the village to find something affordable," Ms. Worthy said.
The project's shift to moderate-income helped it gain credibility with the community, according to Peter J. Murray, one of Mr. Loewentheil's development partners. "There's such a need for housing in this price range," Mr. Murray said. "It helped us get financing and some government funding."
County Legislator Paul Noto, who had been mayor of Mamaroneck when Mr. Loewentheil bought the property, was instrumental in pushing through financing in the form of a $424,000 infrastructure grant to provide parking both for projects residents and the general public.
"It was a loose end I really wanted to tie up," Mr. Noto said. "I was never happy about what happened to the project. So when I had an opportunity to help I did."
By then, the developer had been able to broker a deal with the residents and the village. "Getting the money just helped move things along," Mr. Loewentheil said.
Mr. Noto sees the Continental View story as a cautionary tale to developers, who could face increasing difficulty trying to get projects built in the future.
"It requires patience and persistence," he said. "A developer must be willing to be flexible and work with the neighbors. Once they feel they're involved in the process, it gets a little easier."
One Mamaroneck Village trustee, Martha Sokol McCarty, points out that two other pending projects are now experiencing opposition that could threaten or delay construction.
Avalon Properties, of Wilton, Conn., wants to build 227 luxury rentals on Mamaroneck Avenue just north of the village's downtown. "After undergoing two or three incarnations where they addressed previous concerns in the design of the project, I got a call recently from someone in the village asking when public hearings are scheduled," Ms. McCarty said.
The project has received final approvals and Avalon expects to begin construction by the end of the year, she said. "But people are still complaining," she added. "The person on the phone said that a lot of people in the village don't want a project of that size. It never ends."
SIMILARLY, a proposal for a 114-unit moderate-income condominium on Mamaroneck Avenue at East Boston Post Road, which has been on the drawing board for years, has also drawn negative reaction.
A local developer, the Mamaroneck Affordable Condominium Corporation, has already sold 95 of the units, according to Ms. McCarty. "Basically people were buying a hole in the ground," she said. "But this kind of housing is so needed in the village."
The project has had a lengthy gestation period, Ms. McCarty said. "There have been a number of proposals and owners," she said.
The two proposed projects and Continental View are all on land that had previously been used for commercial or industrial purposes, Ms. McCarty said.
"If they're not developed in some useful way, they become these vacant eyesores that do no good for anyone," she said. "But sometimes I think people get used to seeing them that way and don't want them to change no matter what is proposed for them."

HEADLINE: Habitats/220 East 65th Street;
Pink Walls, Greenbacks

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
WHEN Erik Grossman bought his condominium on East 65th Street, it had pink walls.
"It was all original -- from 16 years ago, when the building was built," Mr. Grossman said. The floors were drab. The doors, he said, were "cheesy." "It was a rental," he said, "and looked like it." 
 So Mr. Grossman, who was born in the United States but had lived 23 of his 28 years abroad because his father was in the Foreign Service, negotiated a deal: He would pay $370,000 for the large one-bedroom with a dining ell -- called a "convertible two" in real estate parlance -- but the landlord would include some renovations in the price.
"I bought the apartment from the sponsor," Mr. Grossman explained, "and I asked him to build a wall, sand the floors and paint the apartment. He threw in the cornice moldings. I paid for new brass handles, for built-in shelves and nicer doors, and I paid a differential to use really good paint."
Now, freshly painted white, with basket-weave wood floors the color of a lion's mane and a second bedroom created by the addition of a wall and French doors, the apartment at 220 East 65th Street has already risen in value to about $425,000, Mr. Grossman said.
"I got that appraisal from my agent, Caroline Brown of William B. May, and from Barbara Russo, the sales representative that handles the building -- who sent me a letter the other day telling me the building was now 80 percent sold -- and just from my own familiarity with the market," he said.
Mr. Grossman, who closed on his apartment in late June, pointed out that the building, known as the Concorde, is currently undergoing major renovations in the lobby. The front of the building is blocked off, and visitors must walk down a ramp, through a parking garage, and to the service entrance on 64th Street to see a doorman. But there are glimpses of what is to come: elaborate cherry-toned floor-to-ceiling paneling is partly installed.
"And obviously, that, too, will contribute to an increase of apartment values here," said the young investment banker, who said he began work at Schroder Wertheim and Company as a trainee right out of the City University, London, and has risen to vice president, specializing in Asian currencies.
MOST recently, his company stationed him in Hong Kong, after a stint in Seoul, and his collecting testifies to his love of things Asian: a marble sculpture of two Buddhas from the Wei Dynasty, circa 200 A.D., sits overlooking the balcony; two 150-year-old black chairs from Beijing flank the French doors; tea baskets and antique boxes and bamboo chests are placed around the living room, and a 1,400-year-old statue of an ox and cart sit under glass on the floor next to the bamboo chest, waiting for a place to be shown off.
After coming from Hong Kong, where he said rents were at least double those in New York City, he thought he could find an incredible apartment here for $400,000. "I expected a river or a park view," he said.
Looking out over his balcony, to distant views of another new apartment building and, immediately, over the street and traffic, he said ruefully: "I had to compromise on the view, but I refused to compromise on location." For his money, he also got two full bathrooms.
In his search, he said, he almost bought an apartment in the Parc Vendome, at 340 West 57th Street. But that apartment was a one-bedroom, albeit an 1,100-square-foot one-bedroom with a fireplace, which would have cost him $360,000 -- only $10,000 less than the one he bought.
According to his calculations, the rent on the one-bedroom -- should he have to leave town for an extended period -- would be only $2,400. He figured the apartment he bought could rent for $3,200 to $3,400.
"It's pure economics," he said.

HEADLINE: SCHOOLS;
All-Day Kindergarten Makes Inroads but Has Far to Go

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
In the early afternoon, the 5-year-olds at the Ridge Street Early Childhood Center haul out soft blue mats and doze for a spell. Napping, it seems, remains as essential to the kindergarten experience as singing, painting and story time.
But unlike past generations, the Ridge Street kindergartners stay in class from 8:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. For the first time, the school system here is providing a daylong program for all kindergartners, part of a plan to improve early-childhood education in one of New Jersey's poorest cities. The school district is joining thousands around the country that view full-day kindergarten as crucial in preparing children, especially those from low-income families, for the intellectual and emotional challenges of elementary school. 
 The Newark district, which the State Department of Education has operated since last year because of corruption and poor student performance, has abolished half-day kindergarten and added 42 full-day classes, bringing the total to 170. It has hired 29 new teachers and reassigned others to the program, which was serving 2,500 children in the first week of school. But it has been able to afford full-day kindergarten only by making significant cuts elsewhere and seeking corporate donations.
Dr. Beverly Hall, the state-appointed superintendent, is paying for new early-childhood programs, including full-day kindergarten, with $3.6 million saved through recent layoffs. The Prudential Insurance Company, which has its headquarters here, donated $250,000 for furniture, supplies and teacher training.
But most of New Jersey's 600 school districts have not been able to start full-day kindergarten. During the 1995-96 school year, 61 percent of the state's 94,500 kindergartners were still enrolled in half-day programs, said Jennifer Seeland of the Education Department. Of 536 districts that offered kindergarten, 211 provided full-day programs for at least some pupils, she said. The other 325 had only half-day programs. Some districts did not offer any kindergarten at all because New Jersey is among 15 states that do not require it.
More than ever, though, early childhood experts believe that 5-year-olds can not only handle a full day of class but also flourish in it. The program also makes economic sense, they say, because it allows working parents to save on child-care expenses.
"It's absolutely absurd that kindergarten is half-day in any district at this point," said Lesley Mandel Morrow, an education professor at Rutgers University who has studied half- and full-day programs in New Brunswick. "The public sector has got to come into sync with economic realities."
Some states now require full-day kindergarten for every pupil and provide money to support it. But for the most part, New Jersey has left the decision to individual districts, most of which pay for full-day programs with tax money. The school financing plan that Governor Whitman proposed in May provides $288 million for early-childhood programs in districts like Newark, where at least 20 percent of the pupils are poor. But the plan does not provide any such aid for most districts.
"Our concern is that districts will either have to take full-day kindergarten to the voters or go backward to half-day," said Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association.
In some cases, districts are doing that already. West Paterson eliminated full-day kindergarten this year because it was taking up too much space in the cramped elementary schools. River Edge and Plainfield are hoping to raise money for full-day programs through bond referendums this fall. Voters in Little Ferry recently defeated a similar referendum.
Although poor districts in New Jersey receive more state aid and qualify for Federal grants to help establish full-day kindergarten, few of those districts provide it for every student. Paterson, another state-operated district, actually has fewer children enrolled in full-day kindergarten than it did in 1991-92, the year the state took control. Last year, 567 of the district's 2,252 kindergartners were enrolled in full-day programs, said Joy Friedman, a district spokeswoman.
In 1991-92, Paterson had 661 pupils in full-day kindergarten, according to Education Department figures.
Early-childhood experts stress that full-day programs should not have a more intensive academic curriculum than half-day programs. Lydia Silva, the assistant superintendent overseeing the Ridge Street Early Childhood Center, said kindergartners there will learn colors, shapes, letters and some numbers this year. But they will learn through games, music and stories instead of workbooks and tests.

HEADLINE: New Party Faces For a Spandex A-List

BYLINE: By BOB MORRIS 

 BODY:
THEY aren't all household names yet. But you can tell they've arrived because they're now hot guests at splashy parties. These new party faces (some from New York, some not) are achieving recognition in the media-driven meritocracy that is New York society. Like money, their names are used as currency on invitations and in gossip columns.
It's a long list (almost as long as the list of new cable TV-channels and on-line magazines), but that doesn't necessarily mean you can forget the names from last year. The A-list universe in New York, after all, isn't like the Midtown Tunnel, which brings in fresh air and forces out the stale every 90 seconds. It's more like a middle-aged paunch or the Blob, absorbing more and more weight with each year.
 
ONE-NAMED POP WONDERS
 
BECK, the new Michael Stipe, who just won an MTV video music award for best male vocalist of the year. BUSH, the new Pearl Jam. OASIS, not the new Beatles, but British, so they're being compared to them. PHISH, the new Grateful Dead. NAS, the new Coolio.
 
NEW BAD KIDS ON THE BLOCK
 
JOHN GALLIANO, French enfant terrible. BIJOU PHILLIPS, model daughter (not as in paradigm, but runway) of John Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas. The Courtney Love of models.

NINA BAUER, 25, who has a broken engagement to Steven Perelman (son of Ron) and an unbroken one to Charles de Gunzburg (whose mother was a Bronfman) on her social bio.
 
STAGEY TYPES
 
THE 'RENT' CAST, because it's nice to have actors at a swank party who play East Village junkies and squatters, not real ones. SAVION GLOVER, who, on Broadway, is no longer just a tap-dancing kid in the shadow of Gregory Hines. JOAQUIN CORTES, a heartthrob flamenco dancer getting an armada-like public-relations send-off.
 
THIS YEAR'S MODELS
 
VENDELA, who just signed to represent Almay cosmetics and married a Swiss millionaire. WILLEM DAFOE, old film and experimental theater actor; new Prada model.
 
TV TYPES
 
JENNY McCARTHY, hostess of MTV's "Singled Out" dating-game show, who was Playboy's July centerfold. ROSIE O'DONNELL (nice suddenly sells.)
 
LETTERS SET
 
KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL, editor in chief of The Nation. DOMINIQUE BROWNING, editor of House and Garden redux. FRANK McCOURT, former schoolteacher whose memoir about growing up poor and Irish is making him less poor.

DAMIEN HIRST, British sculptor whose show last spring in SoHo featured a cut-up cow and pig in tanks of formaldehyde. MATTHEW BARNEY, former J. Crew model and Yale football player whose photographs and videos are about the politics of masculinity. He models to help make his point. NAN GOLDIN, photographer of marginalized subjects who will have a retrospective at the Whitney Museum this fall.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
In the Heat of Passion, What Will the Fed Do With Rates on Tuesday?

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
IN Tuesday, the seven governors of the Federal Reserve and the presidents of the Fed's 12 regional banks will gather in the board room at the central bank's Washington headquarters.
Sitting around the oval conference table, the 15 men and 4 women will debate whether to tighten the economic reins a bit by raising short-term interest rates. But there will probably be more passion than normal, given recent public comments by Fed members, and the unusual leak of a request by 8 of the 12 presidents for a hike in the discount rate, the second of the Fed's two interest-rate levers. 
 Feelings about the meeting are running strong outside the board room, too. Investors and market analysts appear to be as divided as the Fed policy makers, and the myopic focus on the event has resulted in incredible volatility in both the bond and stock markets. The yield on the 30-year bond has moved from 6.69 percent on Aug. 9, to 7.15 percent on Sept. 5, to 6.95 percent on Sept. 13, and to 7.04 percent on Friday.
The mood swings have come with each new round of economic data that changes the bet on what the Fed will do with its No. 1 interest-rate lever, the Federal funds rate. The fearful predictions range from an increase of one-half of a percentage point to no increase at all.
The problem for investors is that no matter what happens on Tuesday, speculation about what the Fed will do next will still roil the markets.
No action on Tuesday means the recent market volatility is likely to continue as each new economic report -- beginning on Oct. 4 with the September employment data -- affects the predictions of what the Fed will do when it gathers again on Nov. 13, after the election.
In addition, there could be a chorus of "the Fed is not being tough enough on inflation" from many market analysts. That sentiment would be bad for long-term interest rates, which are sensitive to inflation fears. And if they move up enough, the stock market could take a hit.
The combination of no action on Tuesday and a strong employment report for September could fuel pressure for a one-half point increase in the Fed funds rate in November. Forecasters would probably say that the Fed needs to be tougher, having passed up a rate increase on Tuesday.
Moreover, "If you go a week or two without the data showing a slowdown in the economy, you would see a large rise in bond yields and probably a small correction in the stock market," said David Hale, chief economist at Zurich Kemper Investments in Chicago.
If the Fed does act, long-term rates should rise but short-term rates could fall because they have already risen in anticipation of an increase. This is the bet of Barbara Kenworthy, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Prudential Mutual Funds. She has taken cash and bought shorter-term securities in anticipation of a bounce from a rate increase.
But even if the rate climbs, analysts will begin speculating on when the Fed might move again, based both on the size of the increase and on their own economic projections.
Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research in Princeton, N.J., believes that the economy is already slowing down. So he concludes that any Fed move would be modest, maybe just a quarter of a percentage point, and another quarter-point later.
But others see inflation just beneath the surface. "The Federal Reserve is right on the edge of a potential upsurge in inflation," said John R. Williams, chief global-markets economist at the Bankers Trust Company. If this is the case, the Fed might have to move more strongly on raising interest rates. And that uncertainty could keep the bond and stock markets churning.
There is a longer-term view of a rate increase on Tuesday, one that sees it as bolstering the confidence of the markets that the Fed will do the right thing: slow down growth to prevent inflation from rising above the 3 percent level at which it has been contained since 1992.
In this view, a Tuesday increase and maybe one more would help assure the slowing of the economy that the Fed itself has predicted, relieving inflationary pressure. And as soon as that slowdown is confirmed in the monthly data, long-term interest rates should fall.
Slower growth is not great for earnings and stocks. But moderate growth with contained inflation would probably not sharply undermine the stock market if long-term interest rates are falling.
Yet, given the recent sharp swings in market anxieties, this view might be shunned for one focusing on a danger of Fed rate increases: that the economy will fall into a recession. In its perverse way, the bond market would be happy with this perspective, but stocks could falter.
No matter how things turn out on Tuesday, then, uncertainties will live on. But some portfolio managers seem less bothered than others by Tuesday's meeting and its consequences.
"If you sit and dwell on what the Fed will do, you will spend your time second-guessing and not focus of the big picture," said Ole Dial, chief investment officer of the $500 million Northstar Total Return fund in Greenwich, Conn.
Charles P. Smith, president of the New Income Fund at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore, said of Tuesday's meeting: "I don't think it's terribly significant to how you stand now. It is not as important as your guess about the how strong the economy is or what inflation will be."

New Life Insurance Isn't Always the Best Policy

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
IN a small auditorium in lower Manhattan last week, the New York State Insurance Department held its final hearing on a new regulation intended to combat deceptive practices in the selling of life insurance policies, a longstanding problem that has cost consumers millions of dollars.
At the same time, insurance regulators from a dozen other states have been drafting similar standards, which are expected to be endorsed later this month by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. They would become a model for regulation throughout the country. 
 "Initially, everyone thought there were isolated cases of this just in their backyards," said Brian Atchinson, the president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the superintendent of insurance in Maine. "Then we realized all of our backyards looked a lot alike. This was a problem clearly of national scope."
The practice, referred to as "twisting" or "churning" by unhappy customers, and by the less colorful term of "replacement" by the industry, has been a problem in New York, one of the biggest insurance markets in the country and the home of scores of insurance companies.
Churning became widespread in the 1980's when interest rates were climbing. Some insurance agents persuaded customers to trade in their old policies for new ones at higher prices with no advantage to anyone but the agent, who received a commission, and his company, which increased its sales. The lure to the customer was higher returns on the new policies.
Customers were often offered whole-life and universal life policies -- which pay a death benefit and offer an investment feature -- that could match the yields of 12 percent and higher that investors were getting from mutual funds and virtually risk-free money markets. For the many people who were holding old policies paying interest of, say, 6 percent, the new policies sounded attractive.
But in many cases, zealous agents showed projections of the phenomenally high interest rates continuing for 20 or 30 years. They did not explain that what goes up most often comes down. Customers also say they did not realize they would lose some critical benefits provided in their original policies. When interest rates eventually fell, many policyholders were left worse off than when they started.
"In fairness," Mr. Atchinson said, "during the booming 80's a lot of very intelligent people lost sight of cyclical turns and didn't seem to realize that interest rates weren't going to stay high forever."
Some of the largest insurance companies in the country have settled disputes over churning. The Prudential Insurance Company of America agreed in July to pay a $35 million fine and to query 10.7 million policyholders for possible claims of improper sales practices that investigators say could cost the company up to $1 billion in compensation. (If all the policyholders file valid claims -- which is considered unlikely -- the average payout would be about $90.) The John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company of Boston, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and New York Life have agreed to compensate some policyholders.
Churning has been an embarrassment to an industry that sells itself on trust, and many insurance executives say they believe it has also hurt sales. In Washington last week, the American Council of Life Insurance, a group of 580 life and health insurance companies, announced the creation of the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association to write a code of conduct for the companies.
In New York, hearings on regulations to aid consumers began last fall, and with the final hearing on Tuesday, Edward J. Muhl, the state Insurance Superintendent, said the new rules should be in place by the end of the year. They still must be reviewed by the office of Gov. George E. Pataki and posted publicly before taking effect.
"The root of the churning and twisting problem is that policyholders often lack crucial information," Mr. Muhl said.
One of the most significant of Mr. Muhl's proposals would require an agent who is selling a replacement policy to notify the company that issued the original policy so it can make a counter sales pitch, arguing why the original policy is better than the replacement. Agents would also be required to explain in writing why a replacement would be an improvement for the customer.
In addition, the new regulation would give customers up to 60 days to change their minds after agreeing to a replacement. It would also require companies to appoint a senior executive to monitor the compliance of the company and its agents, although some companies are doing that voluntarily. New York Life, for example, has created a compliance group of 110 employees to guard against improper sales. Prudential follows up on new life insurance sales by an employee outside the sales force.
In the Prudential case, investigators from state insurance departments around the country found that the company had provided agents with misleading sales materials and had failed to monitor sales practices. It not only failed to discipline agents who were reported to have relied on deceptive tactics, but repeatedly promoted many of them, sending a bold wink of the eye to its agents while maintaining a public policy of adherence to the highest standards of integrity.
Robert DeFillipo, the company's director of public relations, said that while Prudential had accepted the findings of the investigation, it believes "the vast majority of the 10.7 million policyholders were treated fairly."
He added, "We are absolutely committed to resolving every legitimate customer complaint."
NEW YORK State Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, the chairman of the Assembly's committee on insurance, says the commission system gives agents the incentive to churn. At the close of a sale in New York, agents receive up to 55 percent of the first year's premium; in some states the commission is more than the total first-year premium. This keeps agents hungrier to find new business than to preserve old policies, even though the economics of life insurance make long-term arrangements best for most customers.
Mr. Grannis, who will hold a hearing on Oct. 10 in Manhattan on pending legislation concerning agent compensation, says one solution might be to reduce the commission in the first year and extend the payout to agents over a longer period, giving them a greater interest in keeping a policy in force. Another proposal by Mr. Grannis is to require agents to explain their pay system to customers, so they can see the agent's financial interest.
In the insurance department hearing, Nathan M. Perlmutter, an insurance agent and son of an agent speaking on behalf of the National Association of Life Underwriters, an agents' group, argued that compensation is not a primary motive for churning. Even so, he said, as a gesture of good will, the organization proposed that the new regulation stipulate that no commissions be paid until after the 60-day period in which the customer may reject the replacement policy.
Speaking in support of the proposed changes, Albert R. Dawson, a senior lawyer for the American Council of Life Insurance, said that "few subjects arouse as much passion and anxiety in our business as does replacement."
In some cases, he said, it makes sense to replace an existing policy. But with churning and twisting, he said, a "salesperson puts personal gain first and the client interest second."
"Invariably," he added, "the client loses."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Managers May Change; What About Principles?

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
THE founders and managers of the Pax World fund, the country's oldest and largest socially responsible mutual fund, have decided to cash out, selling the company that manages the fund's $500 million of assets.
But some shareholders, who were notified only late last month of the proposed sale, are feeling little peace. They complain that they have been left in the dark about the buyers, and how the sale would affect both the fund's performance and its practice of investing according to moral as well as financial tenets, a practice that Pax World pioneered a quarter century ago. 
 "The fact that shareholders were never informed of the possible sale until the last minute bespeaks an attitude of ignoring our interests," said Milton Feinberg, a retired social worker in Hamilton, N.J., who owns shares in the fund. Mr. Feinberg, 85, said that he was angry that a group that advocates good corporate behavior would not be more open with the fund's own investors.
At a time when fund deals make headlines nearly every week, the sale of Pax World Management, founded in 1971 by a group including two Methodist ministers, Luther E. Tyson and J. Elliott Corbett, has attracted little attention. One reason is that both the sellers and the buyers have avoided any but the most necessary public disclosure.
In proxy materials, shareholders received this assurance from Mr. Tyson, president of the fund and the management company: "From the perspective of the fund's shareholders, most things will not immediately change." Nothing will be altered in the social criteria of the fund, he said, and the current portfolio manager will stay at least a year to insure a smooth transition. And in an interview, Mr. Tyson said "we had the best interests of shareholders in mind" every step of the way.
But some shareholders say they have not been given adequate information about the four siblings who are buying the management firm for $15 million, or about their investment record.
No member of the family group, led by Laurence A. Shadek, an executive vice president at H. G. Wellington & Company, a New York brokerage firm, has ever managed a mutual fund. Instead, Mr. Shadek, his sister and two brothers have mainly been active managing the family's assets, which include investments made early this century in the predecessor company to I.B.M.
Mr. Feinberg said he objected to a statement in the proxy materials that "there is no guarantee that the adviser will be able to attract any other purchasers who are as committed to the fund's policies as is the Shadek family."
"That is an implied threat," he said, "that either we vote for it or we will lose this great opportunity."
The frustrations are likely to be voiced at a meeting on Friday in Boston, where fund investors are to vote on a crucial part of the deal: a new contract with Pax World Management, under new ownership, to manage the fund's portfolio. Despite the concerns of some shareholders, the new contract is likely to be approved.
A mutual fund is owned by its investors, not by the company that markets the fund and manages the portfolio, much as a mutual insurance company is owned by policy holders. Thus, a change in control of the management company voids the contract to oversee the fund's investments and to charge management fees.
The Shadek family has a business pedigree of some renown. In the early 1900's, Mr. Shadek's great-uncle, a Wall Street financier named Charles R. Flint, combined a hodgepodge of floundering ventures into a small conglomerate called the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. In 1914, he hired Thomas Watson, an unemployed young salesman, to run the company.
That company is now International Business Machines, and Mr. Watson became one of America's most successful industrialists. Members of the Flint family, including Mr. Shadek's grandfather, Wallace Flint, were significant shareholders.
In an interview, Mr. Shadek, who is 46, said his family had long been active in venture capital. He entered the investment business after finishing the Graduate School of Business Administration at New York University. He worked for the brokerage firm of Moore & Schley and then for H. G. Wellington.
His brother, James M. Shadek, 44, is a stockbroker at H. G. Wellington. Another brother, Thomas M. Shadek, 45, runs a direct-marketing business in San Diego. A sister, Katherine Shadek Boyle, 36, formerly worked as a stockbroker.
Until now, the family has rarely been involved in the daily operation of the businesses it buys, although it will be active in marketing the Pax fund. Thomas Shadek has run the direct-marketing business for eight years, and he is an officer and director of Wildlife Education Ltd., a San Diego publisher of educational wildlife books. The family owns both businesses.
Though the family does not have experience in socially reponsible investments per se, Laurence Shadek said: "We've always had a belief in investing according to certain criteria and disciplines. We want to be involved in companies that are good corporate citizens, and we've always believed that good corporate governance is part of the picture in long-term investing.
"Certainly we have some things to learn about the mutual fund industry specifically, but we have been managing our family's money for years," he said.
While Mr. Shadek is quick to say that nothing will change with the Pax World fund, the family has plenty of other plans, including starting other socially responsible Pax funds. Pax World is the only fund now managed by Pax World Management.
He says there are plans to start an equity growth fund. The Pax World fund, as a balanced fund, holds both stocks and bonds.
The goal of any new funds will be similar to that of the current one, which, according to its charter, seeks "investments in companies producing life-supportive goods and services and that are not to any degree engaged in manufacturing defense or weapons-related products."
As such, the fund, whose largest holdings at the end of June were Merck, Peoples Energy and Campbell Soup, excludes companies that derive at least 5 percent of gross sales from military contracts. In addition, it shuns tobacco, alcohol and gambling stocks.
Future funds, however, might employ slightly different social criteria to screen potential investments. For example, Mr. Shadek said the 100 largest contractors of the Defense Department included companies like Procter & Gamble and Gillette.
"We don't want to invest in makers of weapons," he said, "but if a company is selling soap or razor blades to the Army, I don't necessarily think they should be excluded from the fund."
Mr. Tyson, who is 73, said the fund's founders had been seeking a buyer for several years, in part because they knew they could not run the fund forever. Of the other co-founders, Mr. Corbett is 74, and Anthony S. Brown, a former stockbroker, is 61. Each owns 29 percent of the management company. The remaining 13 percent is held by Paul V. Brown Jr., a brother of Anthony.
The potential purchase came to the Shadeks' attention through Thomas W. Grant, president of H. G. Wellington, who before joining that firm in 1991 was a managing director at Fahnestock & Company, where Anthony Brown worked as a broker from 1982 to 1990.
"We set up criteria we wanted a buyer to meet before we would consider any kind of negotiation," Mr. Tyson said. "The Shadek family was a good fit. There were other offers that were more remunerative. But we decided based on the deep belief that the standards we set for the last 26 years will be met and exceeded" by the new owners.
LITTLE is known about the investment record of the Shadek family, which has never courted publicity. That is often the case with a family managing private investments, but less so for a group trying to sell mutual fund investments to the public. Mr. Shadek declined to make any family members available for a photograph to accompany this article.
"From a family standpoint, that is always the way we have conducted ourselves," he said. "It is not meant to be secretive. But we'd rather not have the publicity as a family. We'd rather focus on the management of the fund and growth of the business."
What is unclear for investors is how their returns will be affected. Under Anthony Brown, who has managed the portfolio for six years and would stay at least one more, the fund has outperformed its peers over the last year and three years. But its performance has been uneven over a longer period.
Mr. Shadek said shareholders should take comfort from the fact that the fund's six independent directors had reviewed his family's investment record and recommended unanimously that shareholders approve the new management contract. After the transaction, the board would have eight members (down from nine), including the six independent directors.
"I think that's the protection and due diligence shareholders should rely on," he said. "I hope and trust that over a number of years their confidence will be proved true."

HEADLINE: OFF THE RACK;
Looking at Voters' Wallets, and the Candidates' Fingers

BYLINE: By FRED BROCK 

 BODY:
IF the polls are any indication, the old saw that people vote their pocketbooks remains valid. To help such readers, the October issues of three personal-finance magazines -- Money, Worth and Mutual Funds -- have articles examining the stances of Bob Dole and President Clinton on the economy.
The package in Money is by far the most comprehensive and rewarding. It includes an "In Your Interest" column by Frank Lalli, the magazine's managing editor, in which he compares the candidates' economic rhetoric with reality. 
 Mr. Lalli offers some interesting conclusions:
* The details of Mr. Dole's tax plan aren't quite as sweet as his "I'm going to cut your taxes by 15 percent and balance the budget" promise.
* The President's contention that "our targeted tax cuts are paid for" is based on assumptions that may not pan out.
* The line-item veto will give the next President far less power than most people have been led to believe.
* It was Mr. Dole, not the President, who championed (in 1982) the biggest tax increase, when adjusted for inflation, in United States history.
* Mr. Clinton's assertion that "we saved Medicare" when the Republicans tried to destroy it doesn't jibe with a projection that the program's trust fund will become insolvent in 2001.
The main article -- "The Candidates and Your Wallet," by Ann Reilly Dowd, a Washington correspondent for the magazine -- includes an interview with Mr. Clinton in which some of his most interesting comments are about the need for changes in Social Security.
Mr. Dole and Ross Perot, the candidate of the Reform Party, declined to be interviewed.
The package, which is buttressed by the results of a Money poll, covers just about every pocketbook issue on the table and is an excellent primer for anyone trying to get beyond daily sound bites and headlines.
The article in Worth is laudable, but not as comprehensive as those in Money. It is based on questions that the magazine submitted to Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton.
The article winds up with a telling point, however: "As the election picks up steam, remember this: Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's policies will have more impact on the economy, and thus on voters' pocketbooks, than a President of either party."
The contribution by Mutual Funds simply presents the contrasting opinions of two fund managers.
 
A WARNING SIGN? A thoughtful, and troubling, article by Jim Rogers, a finance professor at Columbia University, in Worth examines some signs that foreign investors may be pulling back from financing America's national debt by buying its Treasury bonds, notes and bills.
The ramifications of this could be shattering for the economy, Mr. Rogers writes. He advises American investors to keep some assets out of the country, in a safe currency like German marks or Swiss francs, as an insurance policy.
 
THINK SMALL The October issue of Kiplinger's Personal Finance recommends buying stocks in seven small companies whose profits are growing at least 20 percent a year and which haven't been "discovered" by the market. The seven dwarfs are: Avondale Industries, a shipbuilder; Consolidated Products, a restaurant chain; Friedman's, a jewelry retailer; Horizon Mental Health Management, which provides mental health services in general acute-care hospitals; Lumisys, a medical-equipment company; Nobel Education Dynamics, a for-profit operator of schools, and SEI, a financial-services concern.
To minimize risk, it is recommended that all seven be bought as a package.
 
TAKE CREDIT Smart Money's October issue examines the frustrating problem of inaccurate credit reports. Devin Leonard's "Garbage In. Garbage Out." describes the workings of TRW, Equifax and Trans Union -- the Big Three in the credit-reporting business -- as well as what causes mistakes and what a consumer can do about them.
The problem appears to be widespread. The author says that of the 2.5 million people who request copies of their credit reports each year from Trans Union, 50 percent have questions or disputes about their credit histories. TRW says it handles 360,000 complaints a month.
 
YOUR POCKETBOOK Kiplinger's has a good rundown of 34 World Wide Web sites that can help consumers manage their finances, from investing to buying a car to selling a house. The magazine also recommends that it might be time to look at investing in Eastern Europe, with a list of some mutual funds that do just that.
And in case you didn't already know it, Kiplinger's points out that the nation's banks are on a rampage of imposing fees and surcharges. Last year, the banks raked in $16 billion from such charges.
 
BITS AND PIECES Worth and Kiplinger's both examine the merits of P.I.M., or personal information manager, computer programs; Smart Money gives some excellent pointers on buying an Oriental rug; Kiplinger's presents its "stinky fish" awards to nine mutual fund flops, and Andrew Tobias beats up on Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate and Presidential candidate, in a cover article in Worth.

HEADLINE: An Old Wall Street Pro's Voice in the Campaign

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A FEW years ago President Clinton's political advisers were fuming about Robert E. Rubin's relentless focus on satisfying America's bond markets, fearing that his insistence on cutting the Federal deficit would prove politically disastrous for his boss. But history gets rewritten quickly in Washington. And now some of those same advisers, rejoicing in the latest poll results, argue that the bond markets were in fact a proxy for a majority of American voters, who seem to have decided, in the last weeks of the campaign, that Bill Clinton deserves credit for his handling of the economy.
Whether the markets and the voters are truly in sync won't be clear for 44 more days. But there is little question that the 58-year-old Treasury Secretary, once viewed as a political novice from Wall Street, is regarded in Washington these days as a man who, with a mix of cunning and luck, has worked some quiet economic magic for President Clinton. 
 When the Democratic candidate declares at every campaign stop that he will endorse only "targeted tax cuts that are fully paid for" by budget cuts -- an effort to cast Bob Dole's call for a 15 percent reduction in every American's taxes in the most unfavorable light -- the words have a familiar ring. Mr. Rubin has been using a similar phraseology for two years.
Working out of the limelight, Mr. Rubin's Treasury has also generated a host of Mr. Clinton's campaign-year mini-initiatives that create big headlines but cost relatively little -- including, most recently, the proposal to end the capital-gains tax on all but the biggest profits from selling a home.
Perhaps just as important, Mr. Rubin, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, has time and again sidestepped land mines that could have blown up Mr. Clinton's best case for re-election: his handling of the economy. After the Administration got off to a rocky start with the Federal Reserve, he developed a close relationship with its chairman, Alan Greenspan, over private breakfasts every Thursday morning. And three times in the last 20 months, he has headed off potential political disasters.
He was the engineer of a risky bailout of Mexico that, while wildly unpopular at the time, appears to have worked, with three-quarters of America's $12 billion in loans already paid back, ahead of time and ahead of the election. With a mix of stealth and good fortune, he helped guide the dollar back from the dead before it could send interest rates surging. And, in the heat of the budget battles last winter, he outmaneuvered Republicans in Congress who were trying to force the White House to accede to their budget demands by cutting off the Treasury's borrowing authority. Stepping up the pressure day by day, Mr. Rubin portrayed them as zealots who were threatening to put the United States into default. They surrendered.
"I'm working on the supposition that good economics can also be good politics," Mr. Rubin said recently in his office at the Treasury, tipping back his chair under the portrait of a more fiery predecessor, Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury Secretary. Flashing something between a grimace and a smile, Mr. Rubin added, "I'll admit that not everyone believes that."
He says that he has mostly been playing defense for the President. "The last two years have been more of a balance of preventing bad things from happening," he said. "We've had to focus a lot of resources on stopping untoward things. It's not exactly what I imagined."
Mr. Rubin has been skirmishing with more than just Republicans. He frequently found himself at odds with Dick Morris, a fellow longtime resident of the Jefferson Hotel in Washington, who as Mr. Clinton's image maker sought far bigger, flashier tax cuts in case Mr. Dole's appeal took off. Mr. Morris resigned last month and moved out of the Jefferson after a supermarket tabloid photographed him on the hotel's balcony with a prostitute. (Mr. Rubin's staff joked that their boss is so focused on his work that they believe him when he says he was oblivious to the late-night happenings across the courtyard.)
For the most part, Mr. Rubin has sought to control the debate within the Administration by gently controlling the process.
Before the Democratic National Convention, Mr. Rubin helped to torpedo one of Mr. Morris's ideas -- a deep cut in capital gains taxes on investments in inner cities -- arguing that it would create "minimal economic activity." Instead, he used the National Economic Council, which he once directed, to come up with a series of less costly urban initiatives. Among them was a tax credit for employers to hire longtime welfare recipients, as well as tax incentives for private investment in community development banks and for venture funds that back projects in low-income communities. The measures sound good in a campaign speech, and their cost would be only $430 million.
And Mr. Clinton's proposal to allow homeowners to pocket up to $500,000 in capital gains on the sale of their homes tax-free began as a $4 billion program; by the time it emerged from the bowels of the Treasury, the price had come down to $1.4 billion.
In fact, while it is difficult to overstate Mr. Rubin's influence on everything from tax policy to the budget to economic foreign policy, he has hardly won every argument. This summer, he advised President Clinton not to sign the welfare bill; he was overruled. A month earlier he was clearly uneasy with the Administration's imposition of sanctions against foreign companies that do business with Cuba, arguing that it was an extraterritorial use of American law that would undercut efforts to win cooperation with key economic allies and trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and Britain. Mr. Clinton went ahead, though with watered-down sanctions that will not go into effect until next year, if ever.
And Mr. Rubin is certainly not without his critics in this capital -- especially those who contend that his low-key, self-deprecating manner masks a sharply political use of the Treasury.
In the spring, Republicans became so outraged by his maneuvers to keep paying the Government's bills despite Congress's refusal to raise the national debt limit that they talked briefly about impeaching him. (Mr. Rubin responded by suggesting that his wife, Judy -- who makes no secret of her disdain for Washington life and spends most weeks at their Park Avenue apartment in Manhattan or at their estate in Westchester County -- would happily testify on the Republicans' behalf.)
But Republican hopes of arguing that Mr. Rubin was raiding Government pension funds and juggling the books were dashed a few weeks ago when a study they ordered from the General Accounting Office concluded that Mr. Rubin's manipulations were legal.
Last week John B. Taylor, a chief economist of the Dole campaign, took a different tack, arguing that Mr. Rubin's description of the Clinton tax proposals as "fully paid for" is "ridiculous."
He said the Clinton tax cuts would last only a few years and would be revoked if Government revenues were insufficient.
But even Mr. Rubin's harshest public critics often concede in private that it is difficult to make attacks on the Treasury Secretary stick. Over time he has developed a reputation for bringing a focus and a force of logical argument to the White House. And after the Administration's failure in its first two years to develop a working relationship with Republicans in Congress -- a lapse that Mr. Rubin counts among his biggest political mistakes -- he has been more successful than almost anyone else in the Cabinet at massaging the Republican majority and turning their divisions to his political advantage.
These days, Republican leaders act as though they suspect they will be dealing with Mr. Rubin for some time. That was particularly evident last Tuesday, as Mr. Rubin got out of a Secret Service limousine and entered the Capitol for a brief meeting with a committee that controls the Treasury's budget.
The Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Bill Archer of Texas, who last winter accused Mr. Rubin of courting "a constitutional and legal crisis" over the debt ceiling, caught sight of the Treasury Secretary from afar.
"Bob!" Mr. Archer yelled, trotting up to greet him. "I don't think this election is over yet, but if Clinton is re-elected. . . . " Standing in the hallway, the two men proceeded to talk about ideas for next year, as if it were just about over.

A Special Credibility
It is sunrise along the New Jersey Turnpike and Bob Rubin is racing to a breakfast meeting with real estate developers, Wall Street investors and local entrepreneurs near Newark Airport. He is bleary eyed from six trips back and forth between New York and Washington in the last 48 hours. The final leg, at midnight after a hastily called meeting in the Oval Office about the Cuban sanctions, was aboard a private Cessna jet he leased at his own expense -- a luxury he indulges in often to save time. ("It's one of the only moments when you realize this guy not only signs dollar bills, he has $100 million of them in the bank," a Treasury official who works with him quipped.)
To prepare for his talk he is flipping through the papers, reading about Bob Dole's summertime embrace of big tax cuts and supply-side economics. Mr. Rubin has taken pains not to publicly attack the Republican candidate -- he carefully edits himself, saying that there "is a tradition of keeping Treasury secretaries one step away" from politics -- but he has made it abundantly clear to many that he doesn't think Mr. Dole believes in his own tax plan.
He comes as close as he ever does to a direct political attack after an introduction at a Newark hotel by Representative Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, the Democratic candidate who is in a tight Senate race. Mr. Rubin starts into his familiar patter that every tax cut "must be fully paid for, with no gimmicks."
"There's no magic to this," he says. "Do you really want to explode the deficit, and put America back where we were when we inherited this mess?" Even a few Republicans in the audience applaud.
The entire White House economic team employs this remember-the-Reagan-era argument, but Mr. Rubin brings a special credibility to it with business audiences. He was a deficit cutter before it was fashionable in the Clinton White House. And his 26 years at Goldman, Sachs lend an authority to his pitch. Often, in the presence of Republican business leaders, he doesn't try to win new votes so much as neutralize the opposition.
"Let's face it, many of these people will never vote for a Democratic President, no matter what I say," Mr. Rubin said on the way to one recent fund-raiser. "But even if they don't support the President because they are Republicans, if they have the confidence we are handling the fundamentals right, they won't energize against us."
The strategy is working. Not only do polls show that many more Americans are giving the Administration credit for its handling of the economy -- a recent New York Times/ CBS News poll showed the figure at 55 percent, up from the 30's a few years ago -- but many business executives who would reflexively vote Republican seem to be sitting on the sidelines.
In public speeches, Mr. Rubin appears far more comfortable than when he first arrived in Washington. But he never seems entirely happy at the podium or on television. His mind often races ahead of his sentences, and a result can be long asides that water down otherwise pungent insights. By his own admission, he has never learned his boss's skill in spinning anecdotes. (Reached at his home the day a plane crashed with Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown on board, Mr. Rubin, who worked with Mr. Brown for years, could not think of any incidents that gave insight into the man. "Call Mickey," he said, referring to Mickey Kantor, who a few weeks later became Mr. Brown's successor. "He's good at that.")
So as the campaign enters the final stretch, other members of the economic team, from Mr. Kantor to Laura D'Andrea Tyson, are taking the economic message to the Rotary Clubs and local radio stations. As Mr. Rubin's successor in running the National Economic Council and his most frequent ally in the White House, Ms. Tyson, a University of California at Berkeley economist, is particularly adept at reducing economic complexity to simple sentences. The White House, for obvious reasons, never misses an opportunity to put her in front of women's groups and university audiences. In some ways, she has become the more visible of the two. Mr. Rubin seems perfectly happy with the arrangement.
"What's remarkable about him is that he's got so little ego, and that's not something you see often in Washington," said W. Bowman Cutter, who worked closely with Mr. Rubin for three years until he left the Administration to return to investment banking.
Mr. Rubin's style -- working the inside, minding the office -- stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken by predecessors like Lloyd M. Bentsen and James A. Baker 3d. Both viewed the Treasury as a place for high diplomacy and savored the constant world travel and the pomp and ceremony.
Mr. Rubin dislikes all of that. His aides know that 24 hours before most foreign trips, he will question whether he could accomplish the same results on the phone. As Treasury Secretary, he has yet to visit Tokyo, the world's next-biggest financial center; apart from obligatory foreign summit meetings, he has limited his travel to a one-week tour through Indonesia and India and a weekend in South America. "I guess I see the job a bit differently," he said recently. "My job is to stay in Washington and run the Treasury."
So it is not uncommon to see Mr. Rubin on the third floor of the Treasury, his sleeves rolled up and his tie at half-mast, startling some deputy assistant secretaries by showing up in their offices with friendly but penetrating questions. His focus is so tight that others in the Administration often laugh at how he can filter out other pleasures in life. Ms. Tyson remembers walking through the White House one day with Mr. Rubin and hearing Aretha Franklin practicing for a concert that night for the President. Ms. Tyson wanted to linger and listen. Mr. Rubin asked: "Who's Aretha Franklin?"
As a result of his single-mindedness, Mr. Rubin has immersed himself in parts of the Treasury his predecessors rarely touched, especially the law-enforcement agencies: the Customs Service, the Secret Service and the troubled Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. With little publicity -- and limited success so far -- he has used money-laundering laws to put more heat on Colombian and Mexican drug dealers.
Recently, following a longtime interest in urban issues, he pushed the Treasury into the nation's ghettos in hopes of bringing some market rationale to the crazy quilt of Federal housing and development projects. In July, he showed up in a section of Los Angeles where investment bankers rarely tread: A burned-out lot, surrounded by warehouses, where businesses are still trying to rebuild from the Los Angeles riots in 1992. He was pressing an Administration proposal to use tax incentives to draw manufacturing back into "brownfields" -- abandoned, polluted inner-city lots.
On the same trip, he started talking about a Treasury effort to package public and private loans for low-income housing and small businesses, and sell them as securities on the secondary market in a way that would get the cost off Washington's books. "These are experiments in using the markets to recycle scarce resources, so that what little money we have left in the budget for these kinds of projects can go further," he said.
 
The Mexico Gamble
Robert Edward Rubin may be low key, but he is filled with restless energy. He was eager to get out of his hometown, Miami Beach, where his father was a successful real estate investor and lawyer. At Harvard College he majored in economics and tried to convince himself he wanted to be a lawyer. But after a week or so at Harvard Law School he quit, left Cambridge, Mass., and headed off to the London School of Economics. He returned to law school at Yale, and on graduation went to practice corporate law at Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton in New York. It wasn't for him.
Two years later he mailed out resumes to investment houses and soon jumped to Goldman, Sachs. By the 1970's, a Democrat in a sea of Republicans, he began raising money for Democratic Presidential candidates, while despairing that the party's old, big-government ideology could steer it off the rails.
At Goldman he was fascinated by every detail of every deal; a colleague remembers getting called with questions during Thanksgiving dinner and during the second half of the Super Bowl. Mr. Rubin's mentor was Goldman's chief, Gus Levy, whose photograph occupies the center of a wall of pictures in his office, surrounded by the usual Bill-and-Hillary shots. He learned the brutal arbitrage business, and still occasionally tells stories of deals that went bad. All of this prepared him for the riskiest international investment of his life: Mexico.
The outlines of the Mexican bailout are now familiar: When the newly Republican Congress refused to go along with an Administration plan to keep America's southern neighbor from default, Mr. Rubin urged the President to go it alone, using funds under the control of the Fed and the Treasury. If Mexico collapsed, Mr. Rubin feared, it could trigger a run on emerging markets around the world, from Brazil to Hong Kong. But the move cast the United States into a dangerous new role, that of the world's financial peacekeeper, its emergency lender.
So to discourage other countries from depending on Washington, Mr. Rubin set extraordinarily tough standards for Mexico to get its house in order -- so tough, his critics contend, that it threw millions of Mexicans into unemployment. Today, Mr. Rubin admits that he spent months tortured by the fear that even with the tough requirements, private investors might not return to Mexico. Quietly, he stationed a Treasury agent there to make sure the government was really sticking to its austerity plan.
Mexico is hardly out of the woods yet. But Mr. Rubin is. Private investors crept back in. And by this summer the Mexican Government -- partly to save money and partly to pay back a President it owed so much -- refinanced its debt by issuing bonds to private investors -- unthinkable a year ago -- and repaid the Treasury three-quarters of the borrowed money. Republican critics who had lambasted the bailout were silenced.
"Can you imagine what would have happened if this had failed?" Rubin said one day at the Treasury, putting his hands over his eyes. "We would have spent the whole fall at hearings," answering questions about how billions of American dollars were lost.
 
Taming Currency Traders
Mexico was still boiling when Mr. Rubin faced his second potential political disaster: the fall of the dollar to below 80 yen.
For Mr. Rubin, this was more familiar territory: he had supervised the currency traders at Goldman, and he knew both the fiscal and political risks. "These kinds of occurrences are not without consequences," Mr. Rubin said. A declining dollar tends to drive investors out of American stocks, bonds and Treasury debt, putting pressure on the Federal Government to raise interest rates. "It would take a while to show up, but I'm certain it would have happened," he said.
Mr. Rubin did not add the obvious: high interest rates would have reversed the Federal Reserve's loosening of credit over the last year and undermined the President's argument that life has become easier for consumers because rates have fallen. Moreover, Mr. Rubin was haunted by the memory that in the Carter Administration, a weak dollar came to symbolize a weak America. "I knew we couldn't let that happen again," he said.
Wherever any Treasury Secretary goes, the dollar lurks over him. His airplane, President John F. Kennedy's old Air Force One, is equipped with encrypted communications equipment so the Treasury chief can order currency interventions -- the nuclear strikes of the 1990's -- from 30,000 feet. A flying wedge of wire-service reporters trails his every move, seeking the stray comment that could affect billions in transactions.
Sometimes these reporters get lucky. Early in the Clinton Administration, Mr. Bentsen flipped off a casual remark that the United States was not as concerned about a weak dollar as it was about a stronger yen. Within seconds, the markets became convinced that the Clinton Administration would not defend the dollar, the yen soared, and Mr. Bentsen never again opened his mouth without a script.
Mr. Rubin knew that getting the dollar back up would require discipline, patience, considerable stealth and luck.
His first move was to impose an ironclad rule that he would be the only one in the Administration ever to talk about the dollar, the loquacious President included. Then he repeated, mantralike, that "a strong dollar is in the interest of the United States." He mouthed this so often for so long that even his colleagues began to tease him about it. Mike McCurry, the Presidential press secretary, couldn't help himself during the Group of Seven summit meeting in Lyons, France, this summer. Stopping by the Treasury's early-morning staff meeting he smiled and said, "Bob, let me make sure I have this right: a strong dollar is in the interest of the United States, right?"
"No, no, no," Mr. Rubin said, playing along. "Repeat after me: It's in the interest of the United States that the dollar remain strong. There's a difference. Now, next week I'll teach you about 'stronger.' "
"Oh, no," Mr. McCurry responded, retreating from the room. "I can't handle that."
But words alone don't do the trick. Mr. Rubin's first, tentative efforts to bolster the dollar with the coordinated help of Japan and Germany failed; the intervention was washed away by investors who knew that the governments did not have the resources to outbid them. So he and his deputy, Lawrence H. Summers, a former Harvard economist who has become a considerable power in his own right in the Administration, retreated for months. Then, when the dollar had fallen off the front pages and the market's attention was elsewhere, they ambushed the currency speculators, ordering the Treasury to buy dollars. The idea was to sow so much uncertainty about the Treasury's tactics that no big speculators or hedge funds would risk being caught with a huge position in yen that could cost them millions if the Treasury intervened.
"You can't outgun them," one of Mr. Rubin's close colleagues said. "But you can teach them to fear you." Mr. Rubin smiled, Cheshire cat-like. "Yeah, I've heard some people say that," was all he would say about it. By this summer, the dollar was back to 110 yen -- and Detroit was complaining it was so high that it was hurting car exports.
 
The 'Tensest Moment'
Mr. Rubin had a free hand in fighting the dollar war; the President almost never got involved. It could not have been more different from the battle that truly tested him, an enormous game of chicken over the budget. This was less familiar ground for the former Wall Street trader, and on more than one occasion, aides say, his cool veneer cracked.
His mission was to protect the President from a classic Washington political ploy. Drawing from the Democratic playbook of the 1980's, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his fellow Republicans warned that if President Clinton refused to sign the Republican budget, Congress would refuse to raise the Federal debt limit, the restriction on the Treasury's ability to borrow. That meant dallying with default: if the Treasury could not borrow, it could not pay Social Security and Medicare benefits, as well as billions in Treasury bonds that were coming due.
Mr. Rubin's task was to convince Republicans that they would bear the election-year blame for default -- and the risk to America's rating as the world's safest investment -- while simultaneously assuring the markets he would never allow a default to happen.
Making both arguments required a good deal of footwork -- and, in Republican eyes, considerable duplicity. In public, Mr. Rubin declared, "It is unthinkable that the United States would default for the first time in its history." In private he, Mr. Summers and the Treasury's general counsel, Edward S. Knight, designed a series of moves to liquidate Government pension funds that hold Treasury bills. Once those funds were turned into cash or cash equivalents, they no longer counted against the Government's borrowing limit. But the law was murky on how far he could go, and Mr. Rubin had to keep up the juggling act for months, pushing the law to its limit.
Eventually, Mr. Rubin effectively threw the steering wheel out the window: He declared that he had run out of financial tactics, and that if Congress wanted to bear the blame for default, that was Mr. Gingrich's problem. Mr. Gingrich's troops had to decide whether he was bluffing. Already stung by the public reaction to shutting down the Government during the winter, they backed off. Mr. Clinton never had to choose between signing a budget he didn't want and threatening the fiscal credibility of the United States.
"This was Bob's tensest moment," Ms. Tyson said. And in the end, he helped Mr. Clinton appear to be taming the Republican Congress's excesses -- just the image on which the President is campaigning.

A Bond for the Middle Class
But between now and Nov. 5, Mr. Rubin will be busy using the power of the Treasury to improve his boss's prospects. On Wednesday, in Pittsburgh, he and the President will introduce a new kind of Treasury bond, the first to carry yields that are adjusted for inflation. The bonds are designed for middle-class savers who fear that inflation could eat into their savings, and will be cast as part of the Clinton Administration's effort to make it easier for Americans to plan for their children's college educations and their own retirement.
In effect, the bonds are a kind of marriage of family values and Economics 101. If inflation stays low, the innovation could save the Treasury hundreds of millions of dollars in interest payments. But inside the White House, they aren't known as Clinton bonds; they are called Rubin bonds.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Keeping Valued Employees by Letting Them Go, for a While

BYLINE: By MARCIA VICKERS 

 BODY:
RICHARD SCHACK has had a lot of turmoil -- mishegoss, as he puts it -- in his life. His companion of nine years died of AIDS in 1992, and since then so have a number of close friends. He desperately longed for a break from his job.
So after talking to his boss and going through a long application process, Mr. Schack, who has worked at American Express for 18 years, was able to take advantage of a company program that allows employees to take a paid sabbatical if they spend that time working for a charity. 
 Mr. Schack, 43, chose the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the AIDS outreach organization based in Manhattan, and spent six months last year creating a computer data base for the group.
"I needed to do something different," Mr. Schack said. "I needed to feel that the work I was doing had a social impact as opposed to a shareholder impact."
According to a study by the Conference Board, the management and economic research organization in New York, about 20 percent of the companies in the Fortune 500 offer sabbaticals, giving employees time off, usually paid, to pursue other interests. But social-service leaves, like the one offered to Mr. Schack, are less widespread. The Trends Research Institute in Rhinebeck, N.Y., estimates that they are offered by fewer than 5 percent of large companies, including American Express, I.B.M., Time Inc., Wells Fargo and Xerox.
"Some companies are saying, 'Here's something to offer our very best people as a way to keep them,' " said John A. Challenger of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm based in Chicago. "So an employee may go do something good in the world and that makes both the employee and the company look good."
Gail Gavey, 54, of McLean, Va., who is on a six-month leave from Xerox, does volunteer work with Sexual Assault Victims Advocacy Inc. "Every place I go, I make sure I tell people I work for Xerox," she said. "I pass out fliers and brochures with the company logo. People say, 'Oh, wow.' They're really impressed because they've never heard of corporations allowing their employees time off to do this."
Terms and conditions of social-service leaves vary greatly. At Xerox, which has offered such leaves for 26 years, an employee must be full time and have been with the company for at least three years. Employees receive full salaries and can be gone for up to a year.
At American Express, employees must also be full time and have at least 10 years' tenure. They also must have good performance reviews for at least three years. Paid leaves can be up to one year. The company said it received about 35 applications for sabbaticals last year and accepted 15.
"People who apply for this kind of leave are taking a risk, going out into the unknown," said Joseph M. Cahalan, vice president of the Xerox Foundation, which sponsors the company's social-service sabbaticals. "They tend to be pretty confident people and good performers in the first place."
Corporate sabbaticals generally began during the 1970's, when smaller, primarily high-technology companies offered them to employees to gain a recruiting edge against larger corporations and to retain talent, according to the Conference Board study. Social-service sabbaticals became popular after the stock-market crash in 1987, "when people began to re-evaluate their lives," said Gerald Celente, director of the Trends Research Institute.
"People started looking at measurements of success in other ways than just financial gain," Mr. Celente said.
He added that baby boomers had changed the workplace attitude. "They have a different set of social values because they fought for civil rights, women's rights and against the Vietnam War," he said. "They're reaching a point in their age where they've raised families and built professions, so now they want to do more of what they believe in terms of accomplishing social goals."
Sabbaticals may sound tempting, but what happens afterward? Can employees really expect to step right back into their old jobs, with their careers still on track?
Many companies guarantee employees their jobs back or similar positions at the same level. Mr. Schack of American Express returned to his old job as a director in the travel service division after his leave. He has since been named director of diversity at the company, a job he said he had always wanted. Ms. Gavey of Xerox, who repairs copiers, will resume her job when she returns to the company next month, but she has a new, more intriguing territory: the Pentagon.
Others may not be as fortunate.
"I've talked to people who felt they may have missed a promotion," said Hope Dlugozima, author of "Six Months Off" (Henry Holt, 1996, $12.95), a book on sabbaticals. "But I've got to tell you, there was no one who cared, because they'd had such life-changing experiences."
One way for employees to minimize disruptions at work during a leave, Ms. Dlugozima said, is to plan ahead. Employees should help line up a temporary replacement or begin to delegate tasks to other workers before they leave. Duties should be transferred to these replacements at least a month before the sabbatical begins.
Sabbaticals should also be taken during slow periods for clients, who should be told that an employee is leaving, when he will be back and who will be filling in.
Even while employees are on sabbatical, it is best for them to stay in touch with the office. Ms. Dlugozima recommended calling the office at least once every two weeks during the last two months of a leave to smooth the return to work.
James Nelson, an assistant secretary of state in Mississippi, had a three-month sabbatical in 1993 in Hungary, where he assisted the country in privatizing Government-owned property. He started preparing his replacement about one month before his sabbatical, reviewing "all the pressing issues, hot spots, pitfalls, traps, and how to handle certain personalities."
"Two weeks prior to my departure," Mr. Nelson said, "I included him in the weekly senior level staff meetings with my boss, so he would get an idea of what was going on in the agency as a whole."
Mr. Nelson said the sabbatical had changed the way he was viewed in his current job. "Before going off and doing this," he said, "I was considered just one of the guys. But after my experience, people considered me more of an expert in economic and government affairs."
The sabbaticals also keep employees happy.
"If companies want to attract and keep good people," said Mr. Cahalan of the Xerox Foundation, "they have to adapt their culture and business in order to attract a work force that is changing."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: James W. Broadfoot;
Ivy Emerging Growth

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
SMALL stocks took a beating in June and July, leaving many investors unnerved. Still, these stocks are the choice of many long-term investors because smaller issues have tended to outperform bigger ones over time.
Rough pockets like the one this summer are an unavoidable part of investing in small-company stocks, which are volatile by nature. In the hands of astute investors, of course, volatility can represent opportunity. And shareholders who stick with their small-stock mutual funds may find their patience rewarded. 
 The $88 million Ivy Emerging Growth fund, for instance, was hit hard during the July rout by the selloff in technology shares, which make up the biggest chunk of the fund. It lost nearly 20 percent, compared with 14.4 percent for the average small-company fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund researchers in Chicago.
But for the 12 months through Thursday, the Ivy fund (class A) holds a lead of more than 7 percentage points over its peers, with a 21.9 percent total return. And it has far outpaced its group over the three years that ended then, gaining 23.2 percent a year, on average, compared with 15.7 percent for all small-company funds, Morningstar said.
"So far, it looks like a classic example of an emerging growth fund," said John Rekenthaler, publisher of Morningstar Mutual Funds. Still, he noted that it was a young fund, started in April 1993.
James W. Broadfoot, who manages the fund, said from his office in Boca Raton, Fla., that he looked for companies with "very high growth" in earnings, averaging about 35 percent a year.
"To get that, you're almost forced to look at smaller companies," he said. It is not only easier to grow off a smaller base, he added, but, even more important, many small companies tend to be more "flexible and opportunistic."
Moreover, Mr. Broadfoot said, "we like companies that have bulletproof earnings, and I don't mind paying more for that." Though he seeks companies that should meet or beat their earnings projections, he will push up the portfolio's price-to-earnings ratio only so much.
"If earnings are growing at 30 percent, I would think twice about paying more than 30 times forward earnings," he said.
The average price-to-earnings ratio of the fund's holdings is about 24, calculated from estimated 1997 earnings, compared with about 16 for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
When earnings slip, Mr. Broadfoot is unforgiving. "If the business doesn't meet earnings even one quarter," he said, "I'd be very likely to sell the entire portion unless there was a good reason."
The earnings criteria steer him into technology issues, which make up 35 percent of the fund, and health care stocks, which make up another 30 percent. The next-largest chunk, 20 percent, is a catch-all category called services, made up of companies in business, information and financial services, consumer finance and telecommunications.
Mr. Broadfoot started his investment career at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore in the early 1970's. He left in 1982 with two other people to start an institutional money management firm. He left that firm in 1988, using the next two years to research business opportunities and to write a book, "Investing in Emerging Growth Stocks" (John Wiley, 1989).
In 1990, he moved to Florida, where he plays golf once a week (handicap of 7). "I've always wanted to play more," he said, "but there never seems to be enough time."
He decided to get back into investing, joining the United States subsidiary of the Mackenzie Financial Corporation, a Canadian company that bought Ivy nearly five years ago. In addition to managing Ivy, he runs a nearly identical fund called Universal United States Emerging Growth, with $200 million in assets. Its shares are sold only in Canada.
Mr. Broadfoot has held shares in a handful of companies since the Ivy fund's inception, including Litchfield Financial, which makes consumer loans secured by rural land, and Fair Isaac & Company, which makes credit-evaluation software. But typically he ends up holding stocks for less than a year; the annual turnover rate is 70 percent.
He said he liked companies that have "good visibility, operate in a fairly predictable business environment" or have products that are gaining market acceptance.
Diversity is also important. He has filled the fund with about 200 stocks, with an average market capitalization of less than $500 million. He does not want big positions in small companies because sales of large blocks of their shares can move the price.
With small companies, he said, "you always seem to have unexpected, company-specific events that come out of left field, not related to the industry or the economy, that can have an impact on stock prices."
A sharp jump in a stock can be a signal to sell part of his holdings, usually 15 percent or more. For instance, he said he bought Versant Object Technology recently as an initial public offering at $8 a share. When the price passed $17 early this month, he sold about a fifth.
"It appears to be fairly expensive," Mr. Broadfoot said. "But the fundamentals are still in place, so I thought it was prudent to take some profits." It closed Friday at $25.

Riding a Coattail
Mr. Broadfoot recently added to his position in Citrix Systems, a software maker in Coral Springs, Fla., that makes up about half of 1 percent of his portfolio. Its products allow Windows applications to run simultaneously on a server -- a powerful computer that links desktop machines -- letting companies reduce their power needs and costs. Mr. Broadfoot said Citrix would benefit from Windows NT, the new Microsoft operating system. "As large corporations and organizations adopt Windows NT, they will pull this company along with them," he said.
He estimates that the earnings of Citrix will grow 50 percent annually over the next three to five years. The stock now trades at 58 times estimated earnings, he figured. It closed on Friday at $48.25.

An Internet Play
Mr. Broadfoot is building up his holdings in Analog Devices, a semiconductor company in Norwood, Mass. "The entire semiconductor industry has been under pressure, and I think that investors have been a little indiscriminate about selling these stocks," he said.
He said Analog was "well-positioned because it does business in specialty niches, where the competition is not so fierce." It uses a new technology that allows personal computers to connect to the Internet much faster than current modems permit, reducing the time needed to, say, download a long document.
Given the competition among cable TV and phone companies to enter deregulated markets, Mr. Broadfoot said the new technology should be an attractive advantage. He said that the company was selling at about 13 times estimated 1997 earnings and that he expected earnings to rise about 25 percent a year over the next three to five years. The stock closed on Friday at $27.125.

A Profit Prediction
The fund's largest holding, at 1.85 percent of the portfolio, is Liposome, a drug delivery company in Princeton, N.J., whose stock closed Friday at $17.25. The company uses technology to reformulate existing compounds so a drug can be administered at higher doses without debilitating side effects. One of its biggest products is Abelcet, an antifungal drug used mainly to treat AIDS patients. Liposome has two other drugs in clinical trials, Mr. Broadfoot said.
The company, however, is not yet profitable. "It's taken a little longer than I thought," he said.
Still, he said he expected Liposome to become profitable next year, and he estimated annual earnings growth of roughly 50 to 60 percent over the next three to five years.

Read My Lips: Oral Promises May Bind Employers

BYLINE: By ANN WOZENCRAFT 

 BODY:
IF an employer promises the moon but delivers only moondust, he may be headed for court on charges of fraud.
A California Supreme Court ruling may make it more difficult for employers who make promises they cannot keep. The court ruled in January in favor of a Los Angeles man who said he was enticed to leave a job in New York and to move his family across country for a stable position at a California company, only to be dismissed three years later in a corporate reorganization. The court, which said that employers could be held liable for fraud if they made misrepresentations to their workers, upheld an earlier appellate court ruling that allowed the employee to sue his employer. 
 The court sent the case back to the trial court. The trial is scheduled for Nov. 12 in Los Angeles Superior Court.
While each state sets its own employment laws, and the California ruling is not binding elsewhere, it is likely to have a broad effect.
"California decisions have had immense influence on the court decisions of other states," said Lance Liebman, professor of employment law at Columbia Law School. "This decision is part of a trend around the country to allow employees to enforce employer promises."
 According to the lawsuit, Andrew Lazar, 46, left his job in 1990 as president of a family-owned restaurant equipment company in New York, where he earned $120,000 a year, to accept a position in Los Angeles for Rykoff-Sexton Inc., a national wholesale food supplier to restaurants and institutions. In his new job as general manager of contract and design, Mr. Lazar earned $130,000 a year and said he was told that he would receive regular pay raises based on the quality of his work.
Mr. Lazar, who said he was uneasy about uprooting his family to the West Coast, said Rykoff had told him his new job would be secure and that his job was part of a fast-growing division of the company. He said that he asked Rykoff to put the oral promises in writing, but that he was rebuffed by company officials who told him, "Our word is our bond." Mr. Lazar lost his job in 1993 in a reorganization.
"Lazar's allegations, if true, would establish all the elements of promissory fraud," wrote Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar for the California Supreme Court.
"Employers better mean what they say," said Gary B. Ross, a partner of Ross & Morrison of Los Angeles, who represents Mr. Lazar. "If they overstate something and cause someone to change his life based on what they told the employee over lunch, then the employer can be held accountable."
Martin C. Washton, a California lawyer who represents Rykoff in the case, said the company did not agree with many of Mr. Lazar's allegations, but he acknowledged that the court ruling might lead employers to be more cautious about what they say.
"If employers don't already have a pre-employment procedure, which requires employees to sign a contract that says no previous oral representations have been made concerning the terms of employment and acknowledges the employment is at will, they're risking exposure to this kind of claim by employees who are dismissed for legitimate reason or no reason," said Mr. Washton, a partner with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in Los Angeles.
"Employment at will," the standard in many states, means that employers can dismiss an employee for good cause or no cause, as long as there is no discrimination.
DAVID LEVINE, associate professor of economics at the Haas School of Business of the University of California at Berkeley, said: "Twenty-five years ago, the law was very clear. Employers could say anything they wanted. Employees didn't understand this, and they would foolishly think those promises meant something."
But the old strategy of making promises and then breaking them is getting riskier.
"More and more states have changed their laws to be more favorable to employees to whom promises were made in a form other than a legal contract," Professor Liebman said. Some courts have been enforcing oral promises; he said rulings in New Jersey and Connecticut, for example, had been more favorable to employee claims over fair treatment. New York courts have been less favorable.
Despite the California decision, employees should not assume that they can relax when employers make a promise.
"The main advice for employees today is to realize that employer promises aren't that credible and to realize that the law is unclear and changing," Mr. Levine said.
Once an offer has been made, employees should make sure the terms are in writing, whether about salary, bonus, moving costs, real estate costs, country club memberships, company cars, stock options or the payment of capital gains taxes on the sale of a home.
Employees should be especially wary of oral promises of promotions and lifetime employment. Oral agreements can be binding, but they are often difficult to prove.
"Nothing is really permanent anymore, and employers need to make sure they're very careful about what they say to employees," said John A. Challenger, executive vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago outplacement firm. "Employees should know that having some sort of prenuptial agreement, in writing, is a better bet than relying on an off-the-cuff comment made by the employer over lunch."
Employers shouldn't make promises they don't intend to keep, Mr. Levine said. "Even in states that have historically permitted employers to lie," he said, "there's no guarantee that's going to be true 10 years from now."

Two Win Notice for Guyanese

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
Since they began arriving in southwestern Queens three decades ago, immigrants from Guyana have worked hard for an economic foothold. But they have devoted little effort to local politics, preferring to keep track of politics back home.
But the strong showing of two Guyanese immigrants in Republican primary elections this month, however, may indicate a shift in that pattern. One of the two, Michael Duvalle, won the primary for the Assembly race in the 31st District, defeating Kim Petersen. The other Guyanese-American candidate, Rameshwar Jodha, running in the 32d Assembly District, lost to Katherine James by only 43 votes. 
 Although Mr. Jodha was defeated, and questions remain about how Mr. Duvalle will fare in November in an overwhelmingly Democratic district against two-term Assemblyman Gregory W. Meeks, both of the fledgling politicians were lauded by their countrymen for their efforts. Community leaders said last week that they hoped the candidacies had reminded longtime incumbents that the growing Guyanese community could form a formidable political bloc.
Both Mr. Duvalle, who used to own a home security business and now is a full-time candidate, and Mr. Jodha, an insurance broker, said they had decided to run after what they saw as systematic neglect of their community by elected politicians. High on their list of campaign promises were building of a center for the elderly in a Guyanese neighborhood and financing after-school programs aimed at the children of Guyanese immigrants.
Although the Guyanese population has swelled to 100,000 in Richmond Hill, Ozone Park and Jamaica, residents and community activists have complained about the lack of social programs that are easily accessible and tailored to their cultural needs. Elected officials, many said, have funneled funds to pave roads, establish job-training centers, and build recreational facilities and low-income housing near their own power bases, at the expense of areas populated by the Guyanese.
To some extent, area representatives agreed that the Guyanese had been underrepresented. Ms. James pledged to back efforts to have a Guyanese serve on the local school board, and Marshall Mitchell, chief of staff for Representative Floyd H. Flake, said the Congressman had recently been making a greater effort to reach Guyanese constituents.
"I agree they have been overlooked," Mr. Mitchell said. "Elected officials have not reached out to them the way they should have, and hopefully we're changing that."
Kawal P. Totaram, a lawyer and a community activist in Richmond Hill, said most of the resources aimed at the district had been funneled to neighborhoods that are not inhabited by many Guyanese.
"In District 32, the programs are all in the southern end," Mr. Totaram said. "Many of our members live in the northern part of the district. They have to take at least two buses to get there."
As a result, Mr. Totaram said, many elderly people are shut in, and Guyanese students who have no place to go after school hang around bus stops and street corners, drinking and committing petty crimes. JANE H. LII

Drugstores Go Marble for Marble

BYLINE: By JANET ALLON 

 BODY:
Six months ago, Bashir A. Suba, whose pharmacy and surgical supplies store sits at 104th Street and Broadway, was sure he would be out of business soon. Rite Aid was moving in diagonally across Broadway. The drugstore megalith, the largest in the country, even offered to buy him out and to hire him as the pharmacist.
Refusing, he decided to persevere on the spot where he had run Suba Pharmacy for 14 years. He renovated the front of his musty, cramped store, replacing the old-fashioned windows to provide more space inside. And he spruced up his facade. "Rite Aid has marble, so I put marble on my corner, too," he said. 
 He also tried to focus on goods and services he could offer that Rite Aid, which opened on Sept. 12, would not: surgical supplies, fax and copy services, homeopathic remedies and special ordering.
He emphasized the homespun service that had won him loyal customers -- he delivers some prescriptions personally. And he has opened a biofeedback area where customers can get relief from various maladies by having brain waves charted.
Strollers on upper Broadway -- in a city Rite Aid says is underserved -- are never more than a block or so away from a Love Store, Duane Reade or Rite Aid. From 82d to 110th Streets there are 15 drugstores. Fourare independent. The rest are part of chains.
The story is being played out everywhere. Large chains, with their economies of scale, move in, to the detriment of mom-and-pop shops. The reasons are demographics, said Phillip Schneider, a spokesman for the National Association for Chain Drug Stores. He cited an aging population that needs more prescription drugs, customers who tend to self-medicate and busy two-career couples who want the longer hours of the chains.
Many independent drugstores cannot or do not accept the prescription cards of managed health-care plans, because the insurance companies find it easier to sign contracts with the chains or because the independent stores cannot afford to accept the substantially lower markups. (Suba, an exception, does accept most cards.)
"We're all being destroyed by the chains and by the insurance companies," said Orlando Cuevas, the manager of Unity Drugs, an independent store at 99th and Broadway.
One morning soon after Rite Aid opened, a steady stream of customers filed into Suba. Across the street, a greeter was outside Rite Aid, but the store was fairly quiet.
Mr. Suba said it was too early to gauge Rite Aid's impact but was happy to hear many customers promise to keep patronizing him. Estelle Kattelson, a nearby resident, said, "I'm very upset and very angry because all of our neighborhood stores are dying because of corporate greed."
But the lower prices for over-the-counter products are hard to resist. Leaving Rite Aid, Millie Dweck said, a little guiltily, "They can afford to lower their prices because they are a chain, so what are people supposed to do?" JANET ALLON

Chart: "COMPARISON SHOPPING: Dueling Drug Stores"
A check of prices last week at Suba, an independent drugstore on the Upper West Side, and Rite Aid, a local branch of the national chain, found consumer goods usually cheaper at Rite Aid, but some popular prescription drugs more costly. A Rite Aid spokesman said that the chain's prescription prices are "mid-range."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Of Boom And Boast

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
GEORGE BUSH'S re-election chances took a dive on July 30, 1992. That was the day the Government announced the economy had grown an anemic 1.4 percent in the second quarter of that election year, a statistic that played straight into Bill Clinton's argument that the nation was underperforming.
Never mind that the quarter turned out to be an aberration, and that growth for the rest of the year was respectable if not downright robust. The second-quarter figure was the one President Bush had to defend until the campaign's waning days, and Mr. Clinton exploited it to blame the Republicans not just for one bad patch but for all the economy's woes in recent years. 
 If Mr. Clinton was adept at placing blame four years ago, he is equally skilled at taking credit for good economic news this year.
Growth is healthy (a rip-roaring 4.8 percent in the second quarter), inflation and unemployment are way down and the budget deficit has been slashed. Bob Dole's tax-cut proposals and attacks on the "Clinton Crunch" ring hollow with voters, who appear to buy Mr. Clinton's assertion that his is the steady hand on the economic tiller.

 
 
Undue Credit, Unfair Blame
 Baloney, say economists, not just to President Clinton, but to all political leaders who would have voters believe that they control the nation's economic destiny. Presidents, they said, have almost no influence over the economy in the short run, and a lot less over longer-run trends than they let on.
"Presidents and their opponents, all of them, take as much credit as they can when the economy goes well, and take too much blame when it doesn't," said Charles L. Schultze, an economist at the Brookings Institution, who was chairman of President Carter's Council of Economic Advisers. "Anybody who promises big results in a hurry, just don't believe them."
The American economy is driven by forces so vast and disparate that they are difficult to track, much less control. Technological progress and globalization continually change the dynamics; the sharp rise in the nation's trade deficit last week was in part the result of economically sluggish European countries buying less than expected from the United States.
True, a President is not without influence, especially when it comes to long-term policies on taxes, spending and issues like education that ultimately have an effect on competitiveness. Mr. Clinton clearly deserves some credit in particular for pushing through a tax and spending package in 1993 that helped reduce the deficit.
Republicans, of course, argue that Mr. Clinton had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the deficit-reduction camp. And economists said Mr. Clinton's policies accounted for only a portion of the drop in the deficit; the main factors, they said, have been the absence of a recession and the relatively healthy growth rates of the last few years, things largely impervious in the short run to a President's policy choices.
Indeed, faced with the immense power of the business cycle and its unpredictable ups and downs, Presidents can do little more than hold on for the ride and root for a strong performance from the one person who does have some power to smooth out the bumps: the chairman of the Federal Reserve.

 
 
Greenspan's the Man
 It has been Bill Clinton's good fortune to be President at a time when the current Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, has been skillfully navigating the nation between inflation and recession. And his power to have a far more direct and immediate effect on the economy than any President will be on full display this week. Mr. Greenspan and his Fed colleagues will be deciding whether the economy is showing enough signs of incipient inflation to justify raising interest rates for the first time since February 1995.
A highly unusual news leak last week from the Fed confirmed that hard-line inflation fighters among the Fed's district banks are agitating for a rate increase at its monetary policy meeting on Tuesday. How much resistance, if any, they will encounter from Mr. Greenspan or other Fed governors is unclear. Mr. Greenspan has proven willing throughout the year to tolerate strong growth, but now most economists are betting that Mr. Greenspan is about to draw his experiment to a close, and to raise rates, at least by a token quarter of a percentage point, rather than risk giving inflation a toehold in the economy.
Mr. Clinton will have a very indirect effect on whatever debate takes place within the Fed, since he nominated three of the seven Fed governors and renominated Mr. Greenspan, a Republican first appointed by President Reagan in 1987, who now enjoys wide respect not just from Democrats but from a far more important constituency in his line of work, the financial markets.
The White House avoids overtly lobbying the Fed, but has made clear that it sees no signs of inflation to justify a rate hike now. Even if the Fed does raise rates, the action would take months to be felt throughout the economy, and would be unlikely to slow growth discernibly by election day. But to the electorate it could certainly be a stark message about who is really in charge of the economy -- or at least who is not.

 BODY:

PRISONS
Economics of Punishment
Punishment, it seems, has become almost purely economics. Simple supply and demand. If you have more wayward souls, you supply more prisons. If that costs too much, you economize. Joseph Arpaio is a master at economizing. He's the sheriff in Maricopa County, Ariz., and when he needed space, he crammed 1,000 prisoners into tents in the desert. And he doesn't coddle them with, say, coffee: it costs too much. Bob Dole, courting the get-tough-on-prisoners vote, dropped in on this tent prison last week, but couldn't seem to make up his mind whether, perhaps, Sheriff Arpaio was going a bit far. "I'm just starting to get a feel for it," Mr. Dole said. "I'm going to look a little longer before I pass judgment."
 
ENVIRONMENT
A Grand Photo Op
When President Clinton ventured to Arizona, it was with wide-open spaces, not prisons, in mind. The issue of the day was a stark choice between environment and business, and Mr. Clinton came down on the side of the environment -- in particular, the incomparable red-rock country of the American West. With the Grand Canyon placed with photo-op precision at his back, he declared nearly two million of Utah's more scenic acres a national monument. (Utah? And he was in Arizona? Simple: He might win Arizona, but Utah's hopeless.) Here was the conflict: the area also has the nation's largest known coal reserves, and mining it would have meant 900 jobs. Nothing, however, is as clear as it seems, for it turns out that some mining may be allowed anyway, national monument or no national monument. Oh, well, the photo op was great.
 
FUNERAL HOMES
Grim Reaper Inc.
When Jessica Mitford skewered the death business years ago, could she have imagined a company like Service Corporation International? Well, yes, she probably could have, for she was a master chronicler of excess, and Service is certainly that: it's the world's largest chain of funeral homes, and it's burying rivals almost as fast as it does people. And last week, in its latest foray, it offered $3.1 billion in stock for the Loewen Group, its main American rival. Loewen may resist, but Service was standing by like the grim reaper, with its president citing "a tradition of doing hostile deals." If the acquisition goes through, Service would have 3,750 funeral homes worldwide and would perform one of every seven American funerals. But Ms. Mitford missed it; she died in July.
 
HEALTH CARE
Letting Doctors Speak
Will the health care mess ever settle back into something resembling equilibrium? Maybe someday. But for now, chaos abounds. H.M.O. rules change by the day, and many people can never figure out which doctors they can go to, and when. And sometimes even doctors, once revered as founts of information and comfort, are barred by H.M.O.'s from telling patients their options. If the H.M.O. doesn't cover it, the theory goes, it doesn't exist. States are cracking down, though, with 16 of them -- including New York -- passing laws recently to nullify Orwellian gag rules. But what of free enterprise? Isn't this just an H.M.O.-eat-H.M.O. competition? Up to a point, one state legislator said, but not when "health care is being weakened so a few people" -- those lavishly rewarded H.M.O. executives -- "can make a lot of money."
 
PHILANTHROPY
Sharing the Intel Wealth
If you follow the money, you often find a juicy tale. No, this isn't about Watergate -- it's about a woman named Elizabeth B. Noyce. The name rings a bell, right? It was Robert N. Noyce who helped invent the microchip, unleashing the personal computer on the world, and was a co-founder of Intel -- amassing, as you can imagine, a vast fortune in the process. Now follow the fortune: after a divorce two decades ago, Mrs. Noyce got half of it (the exact sum is unknown), moved to Maine, and gleefully spread a good chunk of it around. Museums, civic centers, universities -- they all got some. A construction slump? She built five houses to provide jobs. Too many Maine banks being taken over? She started her own bank. Portland's downtown getting shabby? Her wallet opened again. This one-woman $75 million charity spree ended last week when Mrs. Noyce died at 65. In Maine, of course.
 
SLOGANS
Three (or Four) Little Words
What an odd world it is when a company thinks it owns a string of perfectly simple words -- like, say, "Just do it." Yet Nike was shocked, shocked, last week that the Dole campaign would adopt "Just don't do it" as an anti-drug slogan. Nike says its slogan "is cemented in consumers' minds as a rallying cry to get off the couch and play sports." (And you thought it was trying to sell shoes.) If it is, indeed, thus cemented, how will Bob Dole's message come across? Stay on the couch? Don't buy Nike shoes? Is he, perhaps, taking a stand in the controversy involving Nike and child labor? It's all a muddle, of course -- thanks to the power of advertising to imbed these things in our consciousness.
 
THE STOCK MARKET
Up. Up. (Yawn.) Up Again.
What is it with this stock market? Every time it soars to a record, the same explanations are trotted out: inflation is in check, profits are good, the economy's strong. But then it soars to another record, and another, and another. Do "perfect" economic conditions keep getting better? There's something mathematically suspect about that notion. No, the answer could well be that people have somehow forgotten that stock prices can go down as well as up. If the market hits a record, another must surely follow. That mentality seemed firmly in evidence last week when, sure enough, the Dow industrials soared to yet another high, even flirting with the 5,900 mark so soon after breaking 5,800.
 
BENEFITS
Gay Rights at I.B.M.
The Senate may oppose same-sex marriage and doesn't want to bar discrimination against gay employees, but corporate America is showing that it has a mind of its own. Starting with Lotus in 1991, one company after another has extended health benefits to partners of gay workers. And last week I.B.M. (which now owns Lotus) joined the march, the biggest company yet to do so. It's partly, I.B.M. said, a matter of sticking to its long commitment to "fairness and equity." But partly, it said, it's simply good business: it wants to "attract and retain a full range of talented people." What of unmarried straight couples? I.B.M. wouldn't go that far -- because they have the option of getting married, while homosexuals don't.
 
SOLUTIONS
From Welfare to Subway
The landscape is littered with intractable problems. New York's subways are not models of cleanliness. Transit workers, like many people these days, bite their nails about job security. And many people shudder at the thought of that welfare ax crashing down on the city's poor. Is it possible that all three could be addressed, at least in part, with one elegant stroke? That was clearly the hope last week when transit workers agreed to let welfare recipients clean subways and buses. Transit jobs would be lost only through attrition, many of the poor would move from welfare to workfare, and the subway system, an M.T.A. official said, will be "cleaner than you've ever seen it." Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, though, didn't like the idea, saying it would undermine the city's own workfare plans.

HEADLINE: The World;
Casting a New Iran in the Old Role of a Friend

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
UNEXPECTEDLY, the crisis with Iraq has revived a debate on a taboo subject: whether, after all these years, America needs better relations with Iran in order to pursue its interests in the Persian Gulf.
The mere existence of the debate doesn't mean that the Clinton Administration can suddenly have a relationship with the country it has branded an "international outlaw" -- or that it should even try. 
 Iran, after all, has been the Bermuda Triangle of American foreign policy ever since the ayatollahs overthrew the monarchy 17 years ago, and its officials have not signaled any serious desire to deal with Washington. Iran still supports groups and activities the United States calls terrorist; it shops for advanced nuclear technology in Europe, flouts human rights standards, retains a death decree for the novelist Salman Rushdie and opposes peace between Israel and the Palestinians.

 
 
At Least It's Stable
 On the other hand, Iran has not developed into the expansionist regional threat that successive Administrations predicted it would become. American intelligence pronouncements on Iran's vast military expenditures and the development of a nuclear weapons program have turned out to be exaggerated or at least premature. And American officials have been unable to produce enough hard evidence to convince America's friends that Iran is, as Washington claims, the world's greatest state sponsor of terrorism.
Besides, Iran, unlike some of its neighbors, seems to have a predictable political future: a clerical regime with an elected President and parliament (however flawed its democracy by Western standards) that faces no serious internal threat.
So with America's position in the region now in question, a number of policy experts, academics and commentators have begun asking whether the United States might hope for a better way to deal with Iran. They are arguing for good old-fashioned balance-of-power diplomacy.
Iran, with its vast population, its huge oil reserves and its critical location between the Caucasus and the Arab world, has traditionally been the dominant power in the Persian Gulf, and the recent crisis has exposed the weakness of America's links to its two closest friends in the region now, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Politically vulnerable, both are unwilling to blindly follow Washington's lead.

 
 
Vacuums
 This, in turn, focuses attention on the power vacuum that has existed in the region since Iraq's defeat in the 1991 gulf war, and on the absence of a long-term strategy by the United States to insure its access to gulf oil.
The current policy of "dual containment" (treating Iran and Iraq as if they are equal threats) bans American-Iranian trade, punishes foreign companies that invest heavily in Iran's oil industry and has no support from any of America's allies except Israel. The policy also seeks to thwart Iran's efforts, with its neighbors, to develop the vast oil and gas resources in the Caspian Sea, by barring American companies from a role in any consortium that includes Iran. The question being raised now is: Is this the wisest course for the United States?
Until recently, even the most subtle suggestion that the United States should consider a conciliatory course was dismissed as appeasement by American officials and most experts on the Middle East. But now proponents of a fresh approach to Iran feel the moment has come to forcefully argue their case. One of the most articulate is Zbigniew Brzezinski, who, as national security adviser during the Carter Administration, advocated a military coup to prevent the ayatollahs from coming to power. He is now saying that America should reconsider whether Iran should once again be a counterweight to Iraq.
"I do not see any reason why we should be pursuing a policy of isolating Iran, because Iran, if we pursue hostility towards it, makes it more difficult to isolate Iraq," he said on CNN last week. "And we need a good strategic relationship with Iran in the longer run if we are to have not only stability in the Persian Gulf but access to central Asia, the countries further north, where there are enormous deposits of energy which will be important in the next two decades."
Others insist that while Iran needs to be contained militarily, the use of economic sanctions -- a policy opposed by America's allies in Europe and Asia -- isolates the United States more than it does Iran.

 
 
A Yearning for Moderates
 "What we are doing with our current sanctions policy is simply strengthening the radical elements that are making the United States into the devil, into the enemy, into the threat," Anthony Cordesman, a military expert on the Middle East at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said at a Senate hearing several days ago.
Mr. Cordesman even raised again the possibility that there might be Iranian moderates with whom the United States could deal. This was an argument that the Reagan Administration used -- and came to regret -- when it sent arms to Iran in exchange for the release of Americans held hostage in Lebanon. The United States, Mr. Cordesman said, should try "to create a structure where the forces which I do think exist in Iran, the more moderate middle class" with "a real interest in economic change, could have an impact on a government which can remain hostile."
And The New Republic, a journal traditionally sympathetic to Israel, argued in its most recent issue that the time had come "to restore a balance of power in the gulf, which means restoring relations with Teheran."
One difficulty in maintaining the current policy is that it is encompassed in a slogan. Slogans sell policies, but they can be misleading and are hard to edge away from slowly when they don't work.
More than three years after Martin Indyk coined the phrase "dual containment" (inspired by a characterization of his policies, "parallel containment," that he had read in a newspaper article), the Clinton Administration is still dug in and is determined to stay there. Even musing about steering another course just weeks away from the election would be fraught with political risk.
"There's no change in the policy towards Iran as long as they continue to use terrorism as a state sponsored method," said Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who, as Deputy Secretary of State during the Carter Administration, had the agony of negotiating with Iran to free the American hostages in Teheran. "There's no basis for a dialogue with them." But some senior Administration officials have begun to distance themselves from the policy -- or at least the slogan, saying they never felt comfortable with "dual containment."
 
 
 
Hello, Mr. Rafsanjani?
 That doesn't mean there will be a policy review, however. And even if there were, it might change nothing. In early 1992, the Bush Administration conducted such a review -- and concluded that any gesture that might be politically meaningful in Teheran would be politically impossible at home. So it stuck with a vague but more flexible policy of promising that good will from Iran would be reciprocated.
In the end, that approach was what allowed President Bush in 1990 to take a call from Iran's President, Hashemi Rafsanjani -- only to discover well into the conversation that he was talking to an imposter.

HEADLINE: Aging World, New Wrinkles

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
A CHARACTER in the comic strip Doonesbury once declared: "This generation is like a great comet, blazing through the firmament, carrying with it a dream as boundless as the universe itself."
"Whew," another figure responds. "How will we know when it's over?" 
 "Esquire will run a piece on the hot new funeral homes."
Keep an eye out for that Esquire issue soon. Worldwide, the great comet of boomers is beginning to cross the 50-year milestone, as President Clinton did last month, and the result will be to create a global society that is by far the oldest in the history of the world. This aging process will be one of the dominant trends over the coming decades in the industrialized world -- and, for different reasons, in the third world as well -- reshaping societies across the globe.

 
 
Old vs. Young
 Scholars point tentatively to several trends:
*Growing political clashes between the generations. The future political battlegrounds may have less to do with the tug between left and right, and more with a new buzzword, "inter-generational conflict."
*Increasing immigration. One way of avoiding labor shortages as baby boomers retire would be to admit more foreign workers, especially young ones.
*Changing attitudes toward infirmity and death. As they progressed through the life cycle, boomers made society less squeamish about sex and menopause. With the same elan, they may now bring more openness to discussions of incontinence, loneliness and suicide, making euthanasia as furious a political and moral debate as abortion is now.
Although this is more debatable, some experts also worry that aging will mean less creative and entrepreneurial societies. Would Bill Gates have founded Microsoft if he had been a septuagenarian? Would he even have used Windows? More broadly, will society be as receptive to new ideas when it is disproportionately hard of hearing?
"We're afraid that as we get an older society, we will lose our innovative capacity, our adaptability to a changing world," said Makoto Atoh, director-general of the Japanese Government's Institute of Population Problems.

 
 
Japan Frets
 Still, there are plenty of people throughout history, from Socrates on, whose creativity and brilliance ripened with age. If Benjamin Franklin or Thomas Edison or Madame Curie had not proved the point, then Virginia Hamilton Adair, a spirited Californian blinded by glaucoma, underscored it earlier this year when she published her first book of poetry at the age of 83, to wide critical acclaim. In addition, the needs of an older society could trigger a new wave of entrepreneurs and inventors.
Whatever the verdict on creativity, though, Japan is particularly concerned because it may be the world's fastest-aging country. Like most nations, Japan had a baby boom after World War II, for the upheaval of war delayed child-bearing across most of the globe, and the postwar years also saw worldwide strides in health care that meant more babies could survive to swell the ranks of the boomers. Japan is also special because it now enjoys (and frets about the consequences of) one of the longest life expectancies in the world -- 76 for men and 83 for women. By 2025 it is expected to be one of the oldest societies on the globe, with more than one-quarter of its population over 65.
The United States will not be that gray, but a virtual demographic revolution appears under way. In 1790, half the American people were under 16. It took two centuries, until 1990, for the median age to rise to 33. But by the middle of the next century, it will be over 40 and could approach 50.
It makes sense that the heroes and heroines in an older society are not the likes of youthful rock stars or 20-something movie actors, and indeed Japan may be a step ahead of other countries by hailing geriatric celebrities, like a pair of 104-year-old twins, Gin-san and Kin-san, two women all smiles and wrinkles, each everyone's idea of a great great-great grandmother. When someone asked them what they were doing with the money from all their public appearances, Gin-san smiled and explained, "We're saving it for our old age."
Gin-san and Kin-san offer a typical face of old age in part because they are women. In 1850, a newborn white baby girl in America could expect to live to 40, two years longer than a white baby boy. That gap has steadily grown, and today a white newborn girl can expect to live past 79, more than six years longer than a boy. The fastest-growing sector in the industrialized world is the "oldest old," meaning those over 80, and there are more than twice as many women in this group as men. The result is that the industrial countries will have a growing number of white-haired widows living for years on their own.
Moreover, while Gin-san and Kin-san are doing just fine financially, many who today are showing their first few gray hairs will not. By some estimates, American baby boomers on average are setting aside only a bit more than one-third what they need for retirement. In almost all industrial countries, social-security schemes are unsustainable: they are mostly "pay as you go" programs of the kind founded by the German statesman Otto von Bismarck a century ago. These plans do not involve real savings, and instead they borrow from today's workers to pay for today's retirees. This means that they rely on a huge excess of workers over retirees. When the baby boomers retire, the system will go bust -- or at least will require adjustments such as later retirement, higher taxes, or cutbacks in benefits. Already, the retirement age to receive social security benefits has been raised in the United States, and more increases are likely.
Later retirement makes eminent economic sense, and not only to avoid pension catastrophes. When most jobs were the likes of hauling hay bales or hoisting steel beams, physical limits forced many people to stop working early, but that is not so much of an issue in an economy where the great majority of people can work without perspiring.
Yet later retirement is not the trend -- just the reverse: people around the world are taking advantage of pensions and social security schemes and quitting earlier and earlier. This combination of earlier retirement and longer lives is leading to a boom in leisure for the elderly. In 1960, an American man could expect only three years of retirement; now he can enjoy almost 10. This is the statistic that, coupled with the advent of air conditioning, has revolutionized Arizona and Florida. It also means that, relatively speaking, fewer people are on the job.
"Now in Japan there are six workers for every retired person," said Yasuhiro Yokota, the director of the International Longevity Center in Tokyo. "But in 2025, there will be just two productive workers for every retired worker. This burden will be huge, and younger people will wonder why they should bear it. I think this may lead to great conflict."
Lester C. Thurow, the American economist, argues in a book published this year that "in the years ahead, class warfare is apt to be redefined to mean not the poor against the rich but the young against the old." In the book, "The Future of Capitalism," Professor Thurow cites the example of Kalkaska, Mich., which he describes as a retirement haven where elderly voters effectively used the school budget to pay for snow plowing and other expenses. These voters then refused to approve further money for the cash-strapped schools, forcing them to close months early.

 
 
Geezer Power
 This perception of "greedy geezers" may grow, partly because elderly voters wield disproportionate political influence, a tribute to their likeliness to vote and their passion about specific issues like social security. The elderly are no longer relatively poor in America, but because of their political influence -- since their feelings of vulnerability propel them to political involvement -- there is still a Government reallocation of resources to their pockets. For all the talk of educating children to secure the nation's future, for all the knowledge that children are the sector of the population most likely to live in poverty, the United States Government spends nine times as much on each elderly person as on each child.
Similar issues are being debated in capitals and dusty villages around the globe, for the aging of the population is a trend everywhere. Indeed, some of the countries that are aging most rapidly are in the statistically younger third world. The reason for aging there has less to do with baby boomers, and more to do with two other demographic factors. Vaccinations and other public health programs are leading to significantly longer lives, while at the same time the expectation that children will survive leads parents to choose smaller families. The average Indian woman today may still have three children, a bundle by American standards, but that is down from five in 1980, and life expectancy has risen from 52 to 60 in the same period.

 
 
The Respect Factor
 "A lot of countries are going to be caught unaware, because they are going to have a big boom in the elderly," said Kevin Kinsella, chief of the aging studies branch at the United States Census Bureau. Governments think that families will be able to look after the aged, Mr. Kinsella said, but he doubts they can handle the task on their own.
Andre Malraux once said that "youth is a religion from which one always ends up being converted." It will be fascinating to watch whether the baby boomers -- who in their youth led a fairly successful rebellion against the moral authority of the elderly -- will in the end be converted as well. It is easy to imagine graying boomers supporting moves to raise the legal ages for drinking or driving, conceivably even for voting. More fundamentally, they may try to restore the mantle of authority that as youngsters they had ripped down. All the current Bob Dole jokes notwithstanding, a recent survey of Americans found that the single value that parents most want to pass on to younger generations is not diligence or patriotism or consideration for others, but "respect for the aged," chosen by 91 percent of those surveyed. That is some distance to come for a generation that, in the 1960's, was famous for Jerry Rubin's dictum: "Never trust anyone over 30."
In this respect, Asian countries may be a bit better able than others to handle the aging of the population: the elderly are respected and the extended family still lingers. The Confucian world has always emphasized respect for the aged, and in Chinese to call an old man "lao" or "old" -- as when Mr. Xu becomes Xu Lao -- is to present him a great compliment, rendered by the standard Beijing Chinese-English dictionary as "our revered Comrade Xu." Children in East Asia were traditionally taught tales of filial piety, like the Chinese one about the old man who dressed up in a diaper and crawled around on the floor like a little baby, so that his even more aged and doddering parents would feel young again.

 
 
Dementia
 Not all children in East Asia were so filial, and Japan used to have ubasuteyama -- literally, "mountains to dump a granny" -- where elderly and unwanted women were left alone to die of hunger or cold. But in Japan today 57 percent of people over the age of 65 still live with their children. The result is, perhaps, not just happier grandparents but also better-supervised grandchildren.
"Here in Japan people live with their parents and grandparents, and the elderly have a role in the family," said Yukiko Kudo, a researcher at the longevity center in Tokyo. "In Japan, they know this role and they are not afraid of it. They feel that as they age they can do some good."
To be sure, as Mrs. Kudo knows -- her parents-in-law live in her home -- many Japanese no longer want to share their homes with their parents. And with so many single children, it often happens that a couple faces the prospect of looking after both sets of parents, creating an inverted pyramid: four grandparents, two parents, and one (incredibly spoiled) grandchild.
The aging of the boomers is vested with great significance in part because they are associated with major social changes over their life cycle. Beginning as teen-agers in the late 1950's, boomers transformed music, politics, hair styles and social mores. More recently, as the boomers have aged and grown pot bellies, they have stoked the fitness and diet boom; with well-paying jobs, they have triggered the surge in mutual funds and a long bull market that has been built on boomer savings and investments.
So what comes next? The graying of the boomers will focus growing attention on the problems of the elderly, from gums to prostates. If herpes was the disease of the 1970's, then dementia and depression among the elderly may capture the imagination in the 2010's. Suicide is disproportionately common among the elderly, as people face loneliness, infirmity, and the prospect of a mental slide into oblivion. Alzheimer's disease was identified only in 1906, when a neurologist named Alois Alzheimer studied a woman suffering from it, and already some 22 million people around the world are believed to have Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. The number is soaring with the aging of the population, for in the 1990's alone, the number of people over age 65 in the world is set to rise by 30 percent.
An American gerontologist, Dr. Robert N. Butler, wrote of dementia in a recently published academic paper: "We will be confronted, indeed, with the 'disease of the 20th century' being transformed into the epidemic of the 21st."
Economists are also exploring the implications of the demographic trends. "As the population ages, the savings rate will decline," said Charles Y. Horioka, an American economist at Osaka University. This is because elderly people, instead of saving, often dip into past savings to pay for retirement. Less savings could lead to shortages of capital and higher interest rates, and also to changes in trade patterns.
Professor Horioka argues that the reduced savings will lead to sharp declines in Japan's capital exports and in the Japanese trade surplus. That process may already be beginning, for Japan's surplus has been tumbling for 20 consecutive months, and it could end up with something that a few years ago would have been regarded as more fanciful than a unicorn, a Japanese trade deficit.
Anticipating the demographic changes, companies are beginning to pour resources into industries that will cater to the elderly. A major Japanese conglomerate, Hankyu, which is mostly involved in railroads and retailing, announced recently that it would prepare for the future by entering the mortuary business. Investors are already looking for hot stocks as demographic plays.
Some brokerages are recommending nursing home companies; others favor golf courses, vitamin manufacturers or investment brokerages. Among the technologies to watch are home monitoring devices: bed sheets that automatically take electrocardiograms and toilet seats that automatically measure one's blood pressure.
Some investment strategists say the stock market should continue to benefit from a net inflow of cash as the baby boomers -- those born from 1946 to 1963, accounting for 31 percent of the American population -- reach their peak earning years in the next couple of decades. The problem is that the boomers would then be expected to pull money out of the market to finance their retirement, triggering a crash that could make 1929 seem tame.
While the consequences of global aging are hard to predict, the one point experts agree on is that the implications are enormous. And while there will be tremendous difficulties paying for the boomers' retirement, there is a bright side to all this. Aging may be a problem, but think of the alternative.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends;
Parochial School Mystique

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
IN the 1950's and 60's, Roman Catholic schools were known as places where all students had to wear uniforms and bad students got their knuckles rapped or their ears pulled by nuns. Except for a handful of institutions, particularly Jesuit schools, they were not regarded as academically superior to public schools.
Suddenly, though, Catholic schools are being held up as a paragon of excellence by, among others, New York City's Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who wants to send some of the city's worst students to them. Studies by the Rand Corporation and others support the Mayor, showing that Catholic school students -- especially the poorest -- have lower dropout rates, higher test scores and a better chance of going to college than their public school counterparts. 
 The new regard for Catholic schools has a lot to do with the falling status of public schools. Twenty years ago, there weren't as many poor students pulling down public schools' averages. And there wasn't as much of a need to start looking for alternatives.
But Mr. Giuliani's plan has people worried that if the city embraces parochial education, it will give up on the public schools. So what is the magic of parochial schools? And, why can't the public schools replicate it?

 
 
No More Rulers
 The magic is not in nuns' knuckle rapping. Corporal punishment is no longer practiced in most Catholic schools, and nuns have largely been replaced by lay teachers. (In most Catholic schools only about 10 percent of the teachers are nuns.)
It is certainly not the resources. Catholic schools are generally low-budget operations, with smaller expenditures per pupil than the public schools. Often they have no fancy gyms or laboratories. And their teaching methods typically are not on the cutting edge.
Maybe it's the uniforms then. Catholic schools still require those, and there are some people who think they engender the right attitude. President Clinton has even recommended bringing uniforms to public schools.
But many educators say more intangible factors set Catholic schools apart: the high standards they set for all their pupils and the close community feeling they engender. Since Catholic schools are smaller, with minimal bureaucracy, there is more interaction between students and teachers.
Perhaps the crucial element is the families' commitment. Indeed, some researchers say this is the factor that makes most of the difference. Catholic schools draw students from homes that value education highly, support their children's efforts in school, financially and otherwise, and often get involved with the schools.
Leonard DeFiore, president of the National Catholic Educational Association in Washington, says self-selection undoubtedly plays a role. But he believes the schools themselves are responsible too.
Catholic schools, some say, are working because they endorse certain values. "Old math, new math. Phonetics, whole language. It didn't matter," said Jacqueline Jordon Irvine, co-editor of "Growing Up African American in Catholic Schools" (Teachers College Press). "There was nothing remarkable about the curriculum or the instruction. What mattered was the people, the purpose, the values, the mission."
That theme is often sounded by those who have studied the schools. Paul T. Hill, the lead author of the Rand study, comparing public and parochial schools in New York City in the late 1980's, said initially he doubted the strength of parochial schools.
"As far as teaching techniques and command of the material, on the whole the public schools were better," said Mr. Hill, now a research professor at the University of Washington. "But the Catholic schools were highly motivational. And if a kid had a bad teacher, the Catholic schools took the responsibility and worked to make sure he caught up."
Most Catholic schools have a strict academic curriculum for all students, not just the strongest ones. It typically includes four years of high school English and math and three years of social studies, science and foreign language, well beyond public school requirements.
"In public schools, you can predict that it is largely African-American and Hispanic students who will end up in the lower track," said Janine Bempechat, an assistant professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. "At the Catholic schools, that is not the case. Even the lowest-track students are required to take one and a half or two years more of English and math than they would in the public schools. The standards are higher." And, Dr. Bempechat said, Catholic school students are less likely to blame external factors for their failure and more likely to believe in the value of effort.

 
 
Crosses and Prayers
 But what about the religious requirements? Parochial high school students typically have to take a religion course every year they are in school (covering scripture, church doctrine and practices and moral instruction), and elementary school students have formal religious teaching every day. These requirements would hold even for the public school students who transfer to parochial schools. What's more, signs of religious faith abound in Catholic schools: There are crucifixes on classroom walls, prayers at the beginning of class, and religious issues raised in history or English classes.
Still, some educators think this is a useful thing. "Even where children are not Catholic, there are retreats and liturgy requirements and a sense of spirituality that pervades the schools," said Peter B. Holland, a co-author of "Catholic Schools and the Common Good" (Harvard University Press, 1993). "This makes it clear that the schools are there not just for academic gains but for a broader purpose. It provides a social context."
Do the strengths of a Catholic education depend on a religious atmosphere? Not everyone thinks so. Dr. Holland, who is superintendent of schools in Belmont, Mass., and a former teacher and administrator in Catholic schools, said, "The kind of things Catholic schools talk about and do are the kinds of things we want in our public school systems -- things like deeper relationships between the adults and kids that extend beyond the school day and a greater focus on the academic curriculum."
Some public schools are moving in this direction, putting more emphasis on a core academic curriculum and trying to enrich student-teacher relationships through sports and other after-school programs. Chicago's public schools recently struck up a partnership with local Catholic schools with the aim of learning from each other.
But, asked Dr. Holland, "How do you create an inspirational ideology in a pluralistic society that is comparable to the sacramental rites and saints in the Catholic schools? The private schools try to do it through inspirational leadership. How you do it in a large urban system, I am not sure."

HEADLINE: The Fed Can Wait

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve is coming under enormous pressure, from inside and out, to raise interest rates when it meets Tuesday. It should resist. The economy is performing better than nearly any economist, until recently, would have predicted. Yet there is barely a whiff of the dreaded monster, inflation, that the Fed is responsible for slaying. The only supposedly "troubling" sign is that wages have begun to outstrip prices -- but that is actually a wondrous turnaround after decades of wage stagnation. Before the Fed clamps down, it ought to have a better reason than the fact that workers are, finally, enjoying fatter paychecks.
Many on Wall Street, and most of the presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks, are pushing for a rate hike as a preventive strike against inflation. But the wiser course is to watch and wait. If, over the next few months, unemployment continues to fall without triggering inflation, then the Fed would have learned an invaluable lesson about how good this economy can get. If, however, prices begin to creep up, then the Fed can clamp down and prove yet again, as if anyone were in doubt, that Mr. Greenspan will not tarnish his successful nine-year reign by permitting higher inflation to grab hold. 
 Tuesday's meeting has drawn exaggerated attention, especially by Clinton supporters, because it is the last before elections. But even if the Fed were to raise interest rates by modest amounts, the economy would barely slow and even that would not happen for six months or more, well beyond November. The feared impact of a Fed hike of short-term rates -- the only ones it controls -- on mortgage and other important long-term rates is also misplaced. A Fed decision to raise short-term rates would signal Wall Street that it intends to bring inflation lower. An expectation of lower inflation could bring long-term rates -- a portion of which compensates lenders for future inflation -- down.
The Greenspan-led Fed has steered the economy to its best combination of unemployment and inflation in decades. A legitimate issue is whether the economy is overachieving. Unemployment is down to nearly 5 percent, the lowest rate in seven years and about a full percentage point below what economists used to think was the rate that could be sustained. Wages are rising slightly faster than prices and much faster than productivity. If those trends continue, profits will fall and companies will react by further pushing up prices. However, profits have plenty of room to fall from their high levels. Besides, workers are hardly flourishing. Total compensation -- benefits plus wages -- has been barely keeping pace with inflation.
The old wisdom -- that a 5 percent unemployment rate puts too heavy a strain on labor markets, driving up wages and then prices -- may yet prove accurate. What makes matters hard is that the Fed cannot wait long enough to find out for sure. It must anticipate problems months in advance or else find that inflation has already spiked and it must crack down hard, creating a recession. Yet there is no reason that the Fed must react before there is any inflationary sign even on a distant horizon.
The Fed would be not be acting irresponsibly if it raised rates on Tuesday. A rate hike might not even be wrong. But it is surely unnecessary.

HEADLINE: John W. Tuthill, 85, Career Envoy for U.S.

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

 BODY:
John W. Tuthill, who served as United States Ambassador to the European Economic Community and to Brazil, died on Sept. 9 in a Washington hospital. He was 85 and lived in Washington.
The cause was cancer, said Frances Miller, who helped him write his memoirs. 
 Mr. Tuthill, a highly regarded career diplomat, was Ambassador to the European Economic Community from 1962 to 1966. In 1964 he issued a warning in a speech to American businessmen visiting Brussels.
Europeans, Mr. Tuthill told them, feared that American business was so powerful that it would eventually change Europe's way of life.
That fear, he said, "is a factor which you and the United States Government must bear in mind." He added, "We must be especially regardful of local problems, local traditions and local pride."
Born in Montclair, N.J., he graduated from the College of William and Mary and received graduate degrees from Harvard and New York University. His diplomatic career extended from 1940 to 1969.
His memoir, "Some Things to Some Men: Serving in the Foreign Service," is to be published by Minerva Press.
He is survived by his wife, Erna; a son, David, of Redondo Beach, Calif.; and seven grandchildren.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE ISSUES;
Crime Rates May Be Down, but the Problem Stays Hot With Politicians, and Voters

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., Sept. 18

 BODY:
There is nothing unusual in Tampa about Ed W. Block's belief that crime is just about the biggest problem around.
On local television stations, car-jackings and murders are reported breathlessly on the evening news. In a recent survey taken in Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, people ranked crime far ahead of their other concerns. Such polls are sheet music for politicians, and their drumbeat crosses party lines: Tough on crime, tough on crime. 
 The only thing odd about all this is that the crime rate has been falling in Tampa, as it has in many other cities around the country. On a day this week when Bob Dole was doggedly pushing crime to the center of the Presidential campaign and President Clinton seemed just as eager to engage the voters' concerns over the issue, the Justice Department reported that violent crime dropped by 9 percent last year.
"That's what the paper says," Mr. Block, 62, said, waving the statistics away as he sat while on a break from his job managing a cigar store in downtown Tampa. "But all I hear about are these car thefts, the rapes, holdups, stickups. In May, I bought a new Honda Accord. Went to this pizza place. When we came back, someone had already screwed around with the lock on the driver's side. Cost me 500 bucks."
With precious few Communists left to stand up to, almost no good trade fights and the economy gurgling along, it is all a politician can do these days to draw up an enemies' list. As Mr. Dole seemed to have concluded this week, there may be no political staple quite like crime. Not even, perhaps, taxes.
"Drugs and crime are sort of good-weather concerns in American politics," said Franklin E. Zimring, the director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of California at Berkeley. "Violence around the corner is something we always have to worry about when we don't have more pressing problems in the immediate vicinity."
Couched in the falling rates for all crimes are numbers that may explain some part of the continuing public concern: From 1985 to 1994, a period when murders by adults were generally in decline, the rate of murders by people from 14 to 17 years old jumped 172 percent, according to research by James Alan Fox, dean of the College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University.
But criminologists, political scientists and sociologists who have studied public opinion about crime say politicians' stubborn focus on the issue in recent years also reflects the fact that Americans' fears of crime have rarely followed the crime rate, and that the extent to which people see crime as a problem has even less to do with the statistical rise and fall.
Nor does people's sense of crime in their own neighborhoods necessarily have much to do with how they see the nation's crime problem.
People's views on the issue, the experts say, appear to be shaped much more by what they see on their local television news and at the movies, by the talk at their workplaces and by the politicians.
"One good solid murder of a baby or a rape-murder of a 7-year-old girl will outweigh a ton of statistics," said Lawrence M. Friedman, a professor of law at Stanford University.
After several years in which reported crime was relatively stable, the proportion of people who thought crime was the country's most serious problem rocketed to 37 percent in 1994, from 9 percent the previous year, according to a Gallup survey.
The source of the public's reassessment is still debated. But some analysts point to a string of lurid incidents that drew extraordinary attention from the news media: the kidnapping and slaying of 12-year-old Polly H. Klaas in California, the cold-blooded shootings by a gunman on a Long Island Rail Road train, the Menendez brothers' slayings of their parents and the assault on the figure skater Nancy Kerrigan.
However vulnerable people may have been last year or a few years ago, said E. Mark Warr, a sociologist at the University of Texas, Americans generally contrast the latest brutal events with the warm, idealized images of "the good old days," when everyone knew their neighbors, left their doors unlocked and did not worry about their children being shot by young gangsters driving by.
In Wichita, Kan., where the police reported that overall crime dropped 12 percent in 1995 and is down 7 percent so far this year, Mayor Bob Knight said there was no question but that crime was the central issue of the campaign in which he won election last year. Whatever the real odds that someone in the city might be the victim of a violent crime, he and others suggested, people's impressions of the problem seem to be shaped more by occasional incidents that reinforce the notion of a place where killers keep getting younger, the street gangs more violent and the courts less effective.
June Hargrove, a 72-year-old widow who lives in a condominium in northwest Wichita, described her neighborhood as "pretty safe," but said she was unnerved by what she saw on the local television news. Beyond Wichita, she said of crime, "It's definitely worse elsewhere."
A survey conducted for the National Law Journal in 1989 -- after a decade in which the murder rate generally fell -- found many people like Mrs. Hargrove. More than 80 percent of those questioned said they thought crime was worsening in the United States. Another 34 percent of the sample described themselves as feeling "truly desperate" about the situation. But in the same poll, almost two-thirds of the people surveyed said the crime problem in their own neighborhood was either improving or staying the same.
Such sentiment has been good political news for Republicans since the crime rate started a long rise in the mid-1960's.
Richard M. Nixon made crime a central theme of both of his successful runs for the Presidency, even at a time when most Americans opposed the death penalty. In 1980, even though the country's homicide rate was hitting a post-World War II peak, the issue was for the most part overshadowed by those of the ailing economy and the hostages in Iran.
But in 1988, George Bush's landslide Presidential victory over Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts owed a debt to a widely criticized television commercial featuring a convicted murderer, Willie Horton, who attacked a couple and raped the woman after being furloughed from a Massachusetts prison.
Mr. Dole turned to the crime issue in part out of a confidence that the rate at which people are actually victimized might be of less political importance than their fears. "Regardless of what statistics say, ordinary Americans suffer acute anxiety when it comes to their safety," said Mr. Dole's campaign press secretary, Nelson Warfield.
The Republican portrayal of Mr. Clinton as tolerant of crime and unperturbed about rising drug use among teen-agers also serves one of Mr. Dole's broader strategic goals, one of his advisers said -- to paint the President as a closet liberal.
The crime issue, the aide said, "speaks to the weaknesses of liberals on a number of different levels -- a lenient attitude toward personal responsibility, a willingness to blame society's ills on some sort of anti-social behavior and not on the ills of the individual."
Mr. Clinton's enthusiasm for the fight over crime has only partly to do with figures from the Federal Bureau of Investigation showing that the overall crime rate has dropped steadily since 1991. Since his tenure as Arkansas's Attorney General and Governor, Mr. Clinton has sought to steel himself against the historical Republican attacks, by supporting the death penalty, backing a ban on assault weapons and seeking money for the hiring of more police officers.
The President's aides seemed barely able to contain their glee at having Mr. Clinton endorsed by the nation's biggest police union just as Mr. Dole began on Monday to focus his campaign on crime. In a telephone interview on Thursday, one of Mr. Clinton's political advisers, Rahm Emanuel, characterized the President at least nine times as standing "shoulder to shoulder" with law-enforcement officers.
"I think the Republicans are in a time warp on this," Mr. Emanuel said. "They have tried to use it over the past 25 years against Democrats. But against President Clinton, with his record, it is not an effective tool."
Pollsters tend to agree. In a telephone survey of 1,020 people on Sept. 3 and 4 by ABC News and The Washington Post, 46 percent of those questioned said they trusted Mr. Clinton to do a better job fighting crime, as against 40 percent for Mr. Dole. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
Mr. Clinton may also be the beneficiary of another gap between numbers and perceptions, one in which some of those who sense that crime is getting worse still believe he can better solve the problem.
"They say it's gone down, but I really haven't seen the change," said Will Williams, 21, a bus company maintenance worker in Tampa. "It's like Bill Clinton cutting the budget. I haven't seen any cuts yet."
Mr. Williams added that he would vote for the President nonetheless. "Bob Dole says a lot of things that don't add up for me," he said.

HEADLINE: A 7th Ave. Campaign Goes to Washington

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
All week, trunks arrived from New York slated for unpacking at the National Building Museum. Tissue and tape, gaggles of models like Kate Moss and Amber Valetta, mounds of accessories and setup crews were a thunderous advance for the arrival of designers like Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Isaac Mizrahi, Linda Allard and Oscar de la Renta.
More than $1 million in clothing was shipped from Seventh Avenue in Manhattan to a city not usually known for its fashion acumen. 
 Washington deals in faux a lot, rarely faux crocodile. But in an unusual alliance of fashion and politics, Seventh Avenue has moved off its usual turf and embraced the rubber-chicken crowd here in a push to give breast cancer a profile that rivals that reserved for AIDS.
Come Tuesday, the elegant but cavernous museum will be transformed into "Super Sale 1996," a shopaholic extravaganza-cum-gala dinner to benefit breast cancer research. Diana, the Princess of Wales, is honorary chairwoman for the evening; Hillary Rodham Clinton will be the host of a breakfast that morning.
More than 1,100 guests, including Gen. Colin L. Powell; Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor; Laura D'Andrea Tyson, President Clinton's top economic adviser, and Elizabeth Dole are expected for the gala and shopping on Tuesday night.
About 800 people paid $500 each for the dinner, while an additional 300 paid $150 to join them for dessert. The cable network VH-1, in broadcasts before and after the event, will be promoting T-shirts designed by Mr. Lauren as part of the fund-raising effort. On Friday and Saturday, the general public, for $15 a person, can have a crack at purchasing the clothing, which was donated by designers for the occasion.
"Nothing this major has ever been done for breast cancer here before so we think it will raise awareness," said Mr. Lauren, who organized the event with Anna Wintour, editor in chief of Vogue magazine; the Council of Fashion Designers of America, and The Washington Post. All proceeds will benefit Georgetown University's Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research, which will present its first humanitarian award to Mr. Lauren.
Mrs. Hyde, a fashion writer for The Washington Post who died of breast cancer in 1990, was a friend of Mr. Lauren. "I made a commitment to her," said Mr. Lauren, who began his personal fund-raising efforts in 1989 with a cocktail party at Washington's Carlyle Hotel and raised nearly $1 million.
"That was the beginning," he said. "Then six months ago, Anna said she'd like to do something really big in Washington and get the whole fashion world in on it. Since this is home base for the center, we thought the exposure would be really great and special."
Initially, there was skepticism about holding a fashion fund-raiser here.
"We thought at first that you couldn't do things here the way you do things in New York," said Katharine Graham, the former publisher of The Washington Post. "But Anna said, 'Let's try.' And she just did it."
Ms. Wintour said they had faced some resistance. "Maybe in New York we get jaded," she said. "Some people said, 'You're never going to raise any money down there.' But across the board, everyone has completely responded, and we're completely sold out. We've got celebrities coming down. Designers have been extraordinarily generous."
The opening night gala, "A Salute to American Fashion," is being underwritten by Mr. Lauren and Vogue, and tables are selling for $10,000 to $25,000 each, which is in addition to the individual's cost.
"We've all written big checks," said Paul Wilmot, vice president of public relations for Conde Nast. "But what starts with the bank account ends with personal involvement."
Ms. Karan, for example, who has been in Europe on business, was expected to return for the gala.
"This isn't about clothes for Donna, but about creative people coming together to do some great things," said Patty Cohen, the senior vice president of public relations for the designer. In the last year, breast cancer has been gradually emerging on a par with AIDS in the fashion industry's charitable hierarchy.
A community that poured out its sorrow over AIDS in high-profile charity events like "Seventh on Sale," the fashion industry's shopping bonanza and fund raiser, in part because many of its creative talents have been stricken by the disease, has increasingly turned its attention to breast cancer.
Women are a natural constituency of the fashion industry so breast cancer awareness has grown out of the lessons learned from the effectiveness of advocates for people with AIDS.
"Ten years ago, breast cancer was just as important an issue, but people wouldn't talk about it," said Fern Mallis, executive director of the New York-based Council of Fashion Designers. "The breast cancer lobby took a lot of cues and learned a lot from the AIDS messengers and fund-raisers."
Beginning with the "Fashion Targets Breast Cancer" T-shirts produced by Mr. Lauren in 1994, the fashion industry has increasingly expressed its support for breast cancer research. Revlon has established a foundation, and Avon Products sponsors a program called the Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign.
In Times Square, Linda Evangelista looms large on a billboard advertisement for Kenar sportswear seeking public support for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. The foundation was established by Evelyn H. Lauder, senior corporate vice president of the Estee Lauder Companies, to raise money for clinical research at 10 medical centers around the country.
Next month, five General Motors cars, each customized by the designers Richard Tyler, Nicole Miller, Todd Oldham, Anna Sui and Mark Eisen, will be auctioned in New York at another benefit as part of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
"A lot of folks are realizing that breast cancer is an important issue for women and women are their main customers," said Jane Reese-Coulbourne, vice president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, which includes 270 organizations. The coalition is working with designers to create a piece of jewelry that could be sold to raise money and increase public awareness of the disease.
But nothing except "Seventh on Sale," on which it is patterned, is likely to rival this week's fund-raising efforts.
"Super Sale was very low-key and fairly small the first year, and it was profitable and good last year," Mrs. Graham said. "But with this nucleus of fine fashion designers, the whole thing has just escalated."
AIDS, Ms. Mallis said, has been the "big galvanizing force" for the fashion industry, teaching it that "we had the ability to raise enormous amounts of money."
Some observers, however, are concerned that expanding the altruistic tent to breast cancer might dilute support for AIDS.
"Sometimes people try to bring that up," Ms. Reese-Coulbourne said. "But this is not the disease Olympics. They're both horrible diseases, and what we really want is not take a piece of the pie from somebody else, but make the pie bigger."

HEADLINE: A Portrait of the City, Painted by the Numbers

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
The numbers that are the life force of New York City government are born anew each year in the Mayor's Management Report, required by law each September. The reports always draw political fire, and the one that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani issued last week came under particular criticism for its sunny spin on the state of city services.
 But the report is much more than a political document. Its gray columns of figures create a snapshot of New York at this moment: how sick or well its residents are, how slowly cars move through midtown Manhattan, how many people skated at a public rink, how many died. These highlights are a small fraction of the complete urban almanac. DAVID FIRESTONE

As Snow Falls in Tetons, Elk Temperatures Rise

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Wyo., Sept. 20

 BODY:
The first snows of the year have fallen in the mountains that dramatically surround this luxury resort town, bringing summer to an abrupt halt and signaling the onset of autumn.
The snow, which has dusted the craggy peaks of the Tetons with a coat of white halfway down, is also a harbinger of the beginning of the season of the elk, as herds of thousands begin their ancient seasonal migration from the high country to lower altitudes, where traces of summer can still be found. 
 Elk are a totem animal in Jackson. The town square is decorated with four large arches made entirely from thousands of bleached white elk antlers, and the only National Elk Refuge in the nation is a five-minute walk from downtown. Elk meat is on some restaurant menus.
In the meadows and pine forests of nearby Grand Teton National Park and on national forest land, branch-antlered bull elk have begun their rut. Sounds that resemble everything from a loud squeaky hinge to a human scream fill the air as the bulls announce that the urge to reproduce is upon them and that they are ready to defend their turf.
Not all elk are below the snow line. Early on Thursday morning, as a heavy wet snow gathered on the meadow grasses of Whitegrass Meadow in the park, the trumpeting of a bull elk echoed eerily in the air while his harem of a dozen cow elk quietly grazed. At the other end of the meadow, near the boarded-up log cabins of an abandoned guest ranch, two bulls locked antlers behind an ethereal veil of white falling snow, struggling for dominance. Each fall the bulls' necks swell with the strength that allows them to battle more effectively with antlers than can weigh up to 60 pounds.
It is still too early for the elk to descend all the way to the National Elk Refuge. "I imagine we'll see the first of the bull elk showing up here any day," said Barry Reiswig, manager of the refuge, which the United States Fish and Wildlife Service operates. "This is a place where they know they're safe."
In the coming months, as many as 18,000 elk will make their descent through the winter clouds that cling alongside the mountains to the long grassy valley of the refuge.
The herds are at the center of an elk economy that has grown in recent years in town and in Jackson Hole, as the valley here is called. On Saturday orange-jacketed hunters will swarm to the region to cull the herd.
Tourists also travel to see one of the great wildlife migrations, especially in the park and the refuge, where hunting is forbidden. Elk are most active this time of year. "Bachelor bulls are breaking into harems," said Greg Winston, an outfitter in Jackson who takes people on wildlife photo safaris. "When they're evenly matched, they get into a shoving match. It's never deadly, but I've seen bulls shoved over onto their back. It's pretty impressive."
A bull elk can also be dangerous. This week, a German tourist in Yellowstone National Park was pinned to her automobile by a sexually aroused bull elk, park officials said, but the woman was not injured.
In December, after the deep snows have arrived, migration is complete, and visitors can take horse-drawn sleigh rides through the extensive herds. Last year more than 25,000 people took rides.
Occasionally elk leave the refuge and wander downtown, browsing on shrubs in yards or standing in roads and highways. Refuge employees sometimes herd the animals back to their area on horseback, but that is no easy task. A fully grown elk can weigh 800 pounds and stand five feet tall at the shoulder. "Elk can only be moved into the wind," apparently so they can sense what's ahead of them by smell, Mr. Reiswig said. "If the wind is blowing the wrong way, they can't be moved."
Antlers are also part of the economy. Each spring, before the herds make their journeys back to the mountains, they drop their antlers.
In May, as the snow retreats, Boy Scouts assemble at the refuge to gather thousands of antlers. Artisans here fashion the branches into items like candelabra, chairs, tables, knife handles, belt buckles and buttons.
Dixie Sowards of Elkhorn Designs, a home-furnishings store, said elk-horn chandeliers were extremely popular. "That one right there," Ms. Sowards said, pointing to a nearly five-foot-tall pyramid of antlers with lights, "is very hot right now."
It costs $5,600.
But the biggest consumers of antlers are dealers, who buy them for $8 or $9 a pound to sell to a lucrative Asian market. There they are made into tea that is believed to have medicinal properties.
The sale of antlers last year fetched nearly $100,000. Eighty percent goes to the refuge; the Boy Scouts keep the rest.

Each fall the bulls' necks swell with blood, strengthening them to battle with antlers that can weigh up to 60 pounds. "I've seen bulls shoved over onto their back," one outfitter said.

HEADLINE: Academics and Labor Leaders Pulling in Tandem Once More

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
After a 30-year estrangement in which union leaders shunned academics as too far to the left and the liberal intelligentsia scorned big labor as part of the establishment, the two sides have begun efforts to forge a new alliance.
Academics are counseling students to become union organizers and are donating time to teach courses to union officials. Cornell University professors held a conference with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. on how labor can do more organizing, while many sociology professors are revamping their courses to focus more on labor's role in society. 
 In early October, several dozen professors will join union leaders at Columbia University for a 1960's-style teach-in intended to give the academic world's imprimatur to labor's new leadership and to explore how intellectuals can advance the goals of organized labor. Similar events will be held at a dozen other schools, including the University of Wisconsin, the University of Florida, Eastern Illinois University, Wayne State University in Detroit and the University of Texas at El Paso.
"We want to lend the support of a large number of academics and intellectuals to the revitalization of labor," said Eric Foner, a history professor at Columbia University who is helping to organize the teach-ins. "From our point of view, there is no real hope for progressive social change in this country without a strong labor movement, and without a strong labor movement the conservative tendency of things is never going to be reversed."
This labor-intellectual alliance is intended to put an end to three decades in which liberal academics and unions were at loggerheads over Vietnam, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s obsession with the cold war and labor's foot-dragging on allowing more women and minorities into unionized jobs.
Labor leaders hope that historians, economists and sociologists will not only help them in union organizing drives, but will also help change the public's perception of labor.
The alliance is being pursued by John J. Sweeney, the president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, at a time when he is trying to build coalitions with other segments of society, including the clergy, women's groups, students, environmentalists and Hispanic people.
"As part of our effort to rebuild the progressive coalition in this country, it's important that progressive academics play a major role," said Robert Welsh, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s chief of staff.
The new ties are still minuscule, compared with the alliance between intellectuals and unions in the 1930's, when academics ran labor colleges and union newspapers and wrote pro-labor polemics. Still, academics have promised that their current support will besubstantial.
"What we're talking about is not just a few intellectuals providing some ad hoc advice, but about some significant potential shifts in research time and thinking," said Tom Juravich, research director for the labor relations school at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
Some conservative intellectuals heaped scorn on this effort. Roger Kimball, managing editor of The New Criterion, a conservative journal, called labor's academic allies "a rogues' gallery of politically correct intellectuals who have a very serious case of Marx envy."
He added: "They are infused with an incredible nostalgia for a kind of political activism which they hope can infuse a higher purpose to their lives. They look to the 60's and to the 30's for models for this kind of militant activism, safe though they are in their ivied groves of academia."
The new effort comes at a time when professors at private colleges, like Bennington, and public universities, like the City University of New York, are facing some of the same pressures that other workers face, like downsizing and pay freezes.
Officials with the American Association of University Professors acknowledge that they hope the A.F.L.-C.I.O. will back their fights to preserve tenure, win raises and reverse cuts in education spending.
At a news conference in Washington on Wednesday, James A. Perley, president of the association, said, "We've come to realize that we need to reach out to make connections to others who are experiencing the same kind of difficulties."
Professors, writers and intellectuals say they have embraced the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s leadership because it is seeking to transform labor into a broad social movement, and, they say, dropping its focus on helping the relatively well-paid union elite. Many academics say they are pleased that Mr. Sweeney has focused on organizing more workers and raising the wages of low-paid workers.
"In the 1930's, many intellectuals supported labor because it represented not just an interest group, but a social movement whose activities promised much to not only its immediate members, but to the whole society," said Steven Fraser, co-chairman of the teach-ins and author of a biography on Sidney Hillman, the clothing workers' leader. "The social movement character of labor began to decline in the 1950's and was pretty much dead by the end of the 1960's. That's what had originally attracted intellectuals. Now, I'm happy to say, that social movement character is returning."
For their part, labor leaders found it hard to forgive liberal academics for opposing the Vietnam War. And in the 1980's, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. hierarchy made common cause with some neo-conservative intellectuals in opposing leftist movements in Central America. In a hierarchy that was forever seeking to root out Communists, many labor leaders were squeamish about associating with academics who they feared were closet Communists.
In recent weeks, professors at U.C.L.A. have advised the A.F.L.-C.I.O. on setting up its Union Summer program, in which more than 1,000 students volunteered to work for unions, and on carrying out an organizing effort at small factories in Los Angeles.
At Sarah Lawrence College, Priscilla Murolo, a history professor, has encouraged some students to become union organizers. And at Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Gretchen Knapp, a history professor, is setting up a teach-in and film festival about the labor movement.
"A lot of our students, after they leave here, will be encouraged to join unions or will deal with unions in some way, shape or form," Professor Knapp said. "These students know little about unions, and we're trying to show them what the labor movement stands for."
The teach-in speakers at Columbia on Oct. 3 and 4 will include Cornel West, professor of Afro-American studies at Harvard; the feminist author Betty Friedan, and Richard Rorty, a University of Virginia philosopher.

HEADLINE: Little-Noticed Cut Imperils Safety Net for the Poor

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, Mo., Sept. 20

 BODY:
A little-noticed provision in the nation's new welfare law that will immediately cut Federal money for safety-net services like soup kitchens and child protection programs has set off a struggle by state officials to preserve what they can.
As of Oct. 1, the Government will chop 15 percent, or $420 million, from the $2.8 billion it distributes annually to the states in no-strings-attached money under a program known as the Social Services Block Grant. 
 States use the appropriations for hundreds of purposes, typically to help the elderly poor stay out of nursing homes, to pay for shelters and day care, to rehabilitate juvenile criminals and to rescue children from parental abuse or neglect.
States say the cuts, which began in June, come at the worst possible moment, when they expect the welfare law to start increasing the demand for the services by people like legal immigrants, mentally disabled children and single adults who stand to lose food stamps or other assistance under the law's other provisions.
"It's not welfare reform," said Greg Vadner, director of the Division of Aging of Missouri's Department of Social Services. "You just have less money. It's purely a funding cut."
Like many states, Missouri is asking managers of local safety-net programs to prepare to accommodate the reduction. Steve Renne, deputy director of the Department of Social Services in Jefferson City, said the Legislature would consider a special appropriation to offset the cuts, using savings from the decrease in the welfare rolls because of the healthy economy.
But some services will be cut, too. "It will be some combination of all those options," Mr. Renne said. "Within the next 30 days, we will have to decide. Our legislative folks don't want to be in the position of picking up the loss when the Federal Government cuts a program."
Mr. Vadner said that in his division, the cuts meant that new applicants for home-delivered meals would be turned away. "We will reduce the number of people we serve," he said.
The concern intensifies at the community level, where social workers, teachers, counselors and local charities come face to face with the poor. The Salvation Army in Columbia, which receives only 2 percent of its money from public agencies and none under the block grant, is already reeling from the effect of the stiffer welfare regulations that Missouri, like most states, adopted in the months before the Federal law was enacted.
"We're getting more and more families," said Capt. Max Grindel, commanding officer here. Through mid-September, he said, he had served 25,000 meals, up from 16,000 at the same time last year. Every night, all 50 beds in the shelter are taken, he said, and he hopes to expand. "We're in need of a new shelter," he said.
Lynn Cole, children's services supervisor for Boone County, of which Columbia is the hub, said: "Some of these people won't be able to care for their children, so their children will be coming to us. What I see is more children coming in for care and less resources to help them."
The cuts, she said, could halt the expansion of services like Althea Harris's. Ms. Harris, 45 and single, has degrees in social work and law, but she has chosen to work as a career foster parent under a four-year-old program dedicated to helping Columbia's most neglected or abused children.
The state pays her $45 per child a day to rehabilitate up to two severely troubled children and prepare them for adoption or return to their parents. She has adopted four of her foster children, now 8 to 17 years old.
"It's just fun," she said of her work. "A van load of kids. Going to the library. Taking them to swimming lessons. We work real intensively with them and their families. We show the parents whatever behavioral techniques work best. What's gratifying is when the kids can go back home."
The state also uses the Social Services Block Grant to help pay for the average $110 daily cost of caring for youngsters ages 12 to 17 in closely supervised group homes after they had turned to crime. Demand for that service, too, is growing, said Terry Finn, regional administrator for the Division of Youth Services.
"We're behind the eight ball," Mr. Finn said. His budget has not yet been cut, but he has been warned that it is likely to be. "We do not have sufficient resources now," he said. "Our beds are filled, and we have a waiting list."
Missouri is not at all unique in wrestling with maintaining these services. Some states with healthy treasuries, like Iowa, say they expect to accommodate the cuts at least through next year by using more of their own money and savings from sharp declines in their welfare caseloads. But others, including California, Arizona, Tennessee and North Carolina, have already reduced some grant-subsidized services. In New York, a task force is evaluating the situation.
Under the principal financing provision of the welfare law, Congress is giving the states a total of $16.4 billion annually to 2002 in the form of different and much larger block grants separate from the Social Services Block Grants. The states will partly match the new block grants and use the money for welfare checks for poor families and training for jobs.
Because the total amount is fixed, the new grants do not take account of the rising cost of living or an eventual recession, when workers would lose jobs and come looking for aid. But the initial grants will be more than the states would have received under the tightly regulated cash-assistance program called Aid to Families With Dependent Children because they are based upon years when the economy was weaker and caseloads were larger. So many states say it could be a couple of years before they begin to feel a pinch in the block grants.
But the effect of the change in financing the Social Services Block Grants, Title 20 of the Social Security Act, is swift and immediate. The 15 percent reduction is an actual cut, not a cut in expected future spending under the old system. That grant is fixed at $2.38 billion a year until 2003, when it would rise to $2.8 billion again.
The cut has already begun to bite. Congress ordered it initially in last April's budget agreement, and the states began seeing a drop in financing in June. At the time, it was a temporary, deficit-reducing measure. But in the new welfare bill, Congress extended the time the cut will be in effect. For Missouri, the grant has dropped to $48.1 million from $56.7 million.
Paradoxically, these grants served as a model of the change the states sought from Congress in overhauling the welfare system, especially the much larger A.F.D.C.
Under the social services program, unlike A.F.D.C., states are allowed almost total flexibility in spending to help the needy, so much so that Congress and the Department of Health and Human Services do not require them to submit breakdowns of their use of the money.
Congress, however, decided not to permit such flexibility with its successor to A.F.D.C., Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. It loosened some strings, for example, in letting states determine a family's eligibility for welfare, but attached new ones, like one requiring that 25 percent of the adults be working by the next year.
In the welfare law, Congress did allow states a way out of the cut in the social services grant. It said they could shift 10 percent of their temporary-assistance money to the services. But that, the states say, forces them to choose which groups of the poor they will serve.
In Columbia, the elderly, like children, are seen as likely to suffer. Jean Leonatti, executive director of the 19-county Central Missouri Area on Aging, said that during the year through June, her staff brought meals to 5,023 homebound old and disabled people.
It also provided 3,498 rides to doctors' offices and pharmacies and sent aides to the homes of 217 area residents, many with Alzheimer's disease, to provide respite care, freeing spouses or other care givers to leave the house.
Ms. Leonatti said the social services block grant had provided about 10 percent of her $3.2 million budget but about 50 percent of the $450,000 of her gasoline costs. A cut in the subsidy in June has meant a cut in service. "We can only travel some of those routes one day a week now," she said, "so we'll bring them one hot meal and four frozen meals."
One of Ms. Leonatti's drivers is Lena Cheathum, 24, a single mother of three children who stays off welfare by delivering meals 40 hours a week and working 50 more in two part-time jobs. She delivers 58 meals a day. Her vehicle is a 1983 Dodge Colt, with 91,000 miles, a torn-out radio and a choking muffler.
Ms. Cheathum is a vital link to the homebound elderly and disabled, but the cut means her visits could become less frequent, even though she is the only regular visitor for some of them. As such, Ms. Leonatti said, she is often the first to spot a client whose health has taken a turn for the worse and needs help.
"I love this," Ms. Cheathum said, as she stopped at the small brick home of Willmetia Armstrong with a warm box containing a pork chop, mashed potatoes, green beans and a cup of tapioca pudding. "The people on my route, they have a fit when I'm not there and somebody else comes."
Ms. Armstrong, who said she was born in 1908, calls Ms. Cheathum "hon." She said: "She lets me stay here by myself and keep out of an institution. They have a girl who comes in to clean, too. I get to stay here as long as I can."

HEADLINE: COLLEGE FOOTBALL;
Florida Stuns 107,608 in 20 Explosive Minutes

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN 

DATELINE: KNOXVILLE, Tenn., Sept. 21

 BODY:
Defying convention, the laws of etiquette and the largest crowd to see a college football game in 66 years, the Florida Gators streaked to 35 consecutive points in the first 19 minutes 54 seconds on the way to a convincing, if misleadingly narrow, 35-29 victory over Tennessee.
The fourth-ranked Gators (3-0) defeated the No. 2 Vols for the fourth consecutive time in their 14th straight Southeastern Conference victory. Florida's triumph became an essential step toward a possible fourth straight S.E.C. championship, ended Tennessee's 11-game winning streak and all but finished any Tennessee hope for a first national championship since 1951. 
 Florida's high-powered victory, built upon calculated risks, odd formations and the time-tested foundation of a solid running game, quieted a passionate standing-room crowd of 107,608 at Neyland Stadium. The crowd was the largest since an estimated 110,000 at Soldier Field in Chicago saw Notre Dame beat Army in 1930.
Tennessee (2-1) outgained Florida, 501 yards to 304, and yet the Gators were never close to being in danger. Peyton Manning set Tennessee records with 37 completions, 65 attempts and 492 passing yards. Manning threw four touchdown passes, three of them in the last 17:21 including one with 10 seconds to play.
Manning had a Heisman-like second half -- 25 of 39, 277 yards, 3 touchdowns, no interceptions -- but the damage was already too much to overcome. The desperate reliance on Manning's passing was a result of a distorted approach caused by six Vol turnovers -- including four Manning interceptions -- in a nightmarish first half. The harsh-sounding proclamations of two Florida sophomores, Johnny Rutledge and Tim Beauchamp, that Tennessee's offensive line was error-prone and that Manning could be pressured into mistakes, became prophetic.
Danny Wuerffel of the Gators was economical: 11 of 22 for 155 yards. Sixty-five of those yards produced four touchdown passes. Wuerffel's career total increased to 82, fifth best in major-college history, two behind Jim McMahon of Brigham Young.
Wuerffel did not throw an interception, as Florida lost just one fumble and converted three of the six Vol turnovers into 21 Gator points. Florida produced 149 rushing yards -- 86 by Terry Jackson -- and held Tennessee to 9 net rushing yards, a factor that allowed Florida to establish control.
At the end, the scoreboard said this game was the closest between Florida and Tennessee in 20 years. But Florida's victory, over the highest-ranked opponent any Gator team has ever defeated, was built upon a dominance in two categories that was established from the start.
The more aggressive Gator defense, reconstructed by a new defensive coordinator, Bob Stoops, held the Volunteers to the sixth-fewest rushing yards in Florida's S.E.C. history. "We have a big package," said James Bates, a linebacker who had one of the interceptions. "It was frustrating to come into spring camp and have it all thrown out at us. It was like, 'Are we ever going to learn it?' "
Tennessee had rushed for at least 100 yards in 20 of the previous 21 regular-season games. Today the single-digit Vol total included 3 yards on 14 carries in the first half, a limitation created in part by injuries that thinned an already inexperienced offensive line. Jarvis Reado, a junior right tackle, fractured his right fibula and suffered ligament damage. Brent Gibson, a senior center and the line's leader, sprained his left ankle.
Florida's rushing game produced 149 yards, enough to sustain a pace that remained in its favor until the outcome was no longer in doubt. "There was no pressure on us at all," said Elijah Williams, a tailback who gained 51 of his 74 yards on Florida's first three offensive plays. "They were ranked higher, at their place, a hundred and something thousand. It was just us against them."
Tennessee's six turnovers, which tied a school record, equaled Manning's total for the entire 1995 season. Anthone Lott's 27-yard run on a fumble recovery, Florida's school-record sixth defensive touchdown of the season, gave the Gators a 35-0 lead with 10:06 to go in the second quarter.
"That's the darnedest first quarter I've ever been through, ever seen," said Phillip Fulmer, the Tennessee coach.
The Gators, with the resolve of an experienced gambler, chose to go for it on five fourth-down plays. They were successful four of the five times, a pattern that began with an incomprehensible fourth-and-11 attempt from the Vol 35, in the rain, on the first offensive series of the game. The result was a 35-yard touchdown pass to Reidel Anthony, the first of four for Wuerffel.
"When you go for it on fourth down," said Steve Spurrier, the coach of the Gators, "we look real stupid if we don't make it."
Manning's first interception, grabbed by Teako Brown after it deflected off the right hand of Marcus Nash, set up a 10-yard touchdown pass from Wuerffel to Terry Jackson for a 14-0 lead.
At that point, going back to the bizarre comeback victory over the Vols last season, Wuerffel had led the Gators to nine consecutive touchdown drives against Tennessee. The lead was just two touchdowns, but already, the Vols were being pushed into a corner.
Tennessee reached the Florida 46, was faced with a fourth-and-7 situation, and Spurrier's successful gambles lured Fulmer into a trap. The Vols kept their offense on the field, Manning threw toward Joey Kent, and Brown delivered a hit that created an incompletion.
The next time the Vols were in Gator territory, they were behind by 35 points.
"I thought we had a chance to win in the second half," Manning said. "It took us a while to get going in the third quarter. We finally got things rolling, but it was too late."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	West Virginia Still Unbeaten
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind., Sept. 21 (AP) -- West Virginia's defense intercepted four Purdue passes, harassed quarterback Billy Dicken with seven sacks, took advantage of penalties and beat the Boilermakers, 20-6, tonight. West Virginia did not let Purdue (0-3) inside the 25 until early in the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: Missiles Aimed at Iraq Are Armed With Failure

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (column, Sept. 18), asserting that President Clinton had to launch missile attacks against Iraq unilaterally, says that's "why God created cruise missiles -- for operations without allies." This reflects a dangerous arrogance of power.
The current generation of cruise missiles was developed by the Pentagon, not by God. In the late 1970's and early 1980's the Defense Department accelerated the development of cruise missiles to overcome the Vietnam syndrome and to augment United States superiority over the Soviet Union. 
 Cruise missiles were seen as a means to conduct massive aerial bombardments without immediately risking American casualties, as highly accurate vehicles to deliver nuclear warheads and as handy devices for destroying Soviet warships.
Mr. Friedman's claim of unilateral military action as "the price of leadership" obscures reality and undermines democracy. In fact, since 1944 when the United States replaced Britain as the hegemonic power in the Middle East, Washington has used "any means necessary" (in the words of the Carter Doctrine) to insure ultimate control over Middle East oil.
These means have included repeated threats to initiate nuclear war, subversion of elected governments by the Central Intelligence Agency, devastation of the Iraqi infrastructure in the Persian Gulf war, and the subsequent embargo, which the United Nations says may have cost 500,000 civilian lives.
Not incidentally, control of Middle East oil has provided the United States with influence over the economies and politics of Japan and our European allies, among others.
Mr. Friedman correctly describes the paucity of Washington's vision for the Middle East. Would that he had written what he must surely know: Neither cruise missiles nor military action will bring peace or justice to Iraq or the Middle East.
The old cliche is right. War reflects the failure of policy. The United States should be working through the United Nations and other diplomatic forums to address the dangers inherent in Saddam Hussein's brutal rule and to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN AND HIS ENEMIES
By Robert Middlekauff.
Illustrated. 255 pp. Berkeley:
University of California Press. $24.95.
Benjamin Franklin calculated the advantages to be derived from friendship. It was important, he thought, to appear genuinely likable in public. Unlike most people who have achieved great success, Franklin described exactly how he did it. If one wanted to win friends and gain followers, for example, one avoided argumentative words such as "certainly" and "undoubtedly." Instead, one employed more modest language, advancing topics of self-interest in terms like "I conceive," "I apprehend" or "I imagine." Franklin mastered these strategies, and contemporaries of all classes and backgrounds -- women as well as men -- testified to his extraordinary charm. 
 Franklin had less to say about making enemies. In public affairs, personal animosity slightly puzzled him, as if he could not quite comprehend why others might detest such a genial man. Quite a few people accepted the challenge. They interpreted as guile what others saw as charm. A Pennsylvania political rival once claimed in print that Franklin had a "wicked and virulent spirit," an "inflammatory" character and a "foul" mouth, and concluded that Franklin was "a very bad man, or one delirious with rage, disappointment and malice," bearing "the most unpopular and odious name in the province."
Venomous attacks on Franklin are not the stuff of popular mythology. Modern historians have generally found Franklin as likable as most of his contemporaries did. Robert Middlekauff, a historian at the University of California, Berkeley, also holds him in high regard. His purpose is neither to vilify Franklin nor to defend him against scurrilous attack, but rather to understand better how human passions have powerfully shaped public events. The past, he argues, is not simply a narrative of "objective" social and economic conditions. It also involves strong personal feelings, like disappointment and envy, hatred and scorn. Countering the dominant interpretive currents of recent social history, Mr. Middlekauff declares that his "central assumptions are that emotions are as important as objective circumstances and that they are usually inseparable from what can be counted and measured and seen."
He reviews Franklin's long battle with Thomas Penn, an irascible man who was the son of the founder of Pennsylvania, as well as the proprietor of the colony. The colony's charter gave the younger Penn extraordinary powers over local affairs. Not only did he hold popularly elected government in contempt; he refused to pay taxes on huge tracts of land he owned. Such disdain for the colonists' welfare was bound to put him at odds with a man like Franklin.
But it was not political issues that ultimately sustained the controversy. Penn truly disliked Franklin, seeing him as a duplicitous and manipulative social leveler. "I should be very Glad he inhabited any other Country," Penn said, "as I believe him of a very uneasy Spirit." The proprietor's aristocratic condescension stung Franklin's pride, and as the contest developed, he gave as good as he got, charging Penn with gross insensitivity to the concerns of the ordinary people of Pennsylvania. In 1757 the Pennsylvania Assembly, or legislature, sent Franklin to London to negotiate with Penn. After one heated meeting, Franklin called Penn "a low Jockey," confessing that he "conceived that moment a more cordial and thorough Contempt for him than I ever before felt for any Man living -- a Contempt that I cannot express in Words."
So the exchanges might have continued, except, as Mr. Middlekauff observes, extreme anger began to cloud Franklin's normally clear judgment. He lost self-control and his passion overruled reason, the failing he disliked most in other people. Hatred for the proprietor persuaded Franklin to ask King George III to strip Penn of his charter powers and to declare Pennsylvania a royal colony. But Franklin discovered that the King and his ministers had no more interest in promoting popular government in America than Penn had. Franklin endured a humiliating public defeat, one he might have avoided had he reflected more dispassionately about the political situation.
Later Franklin acquired other enemies during the long Revolutionary crisis. These people annoyed him, often making it difficult for him to carry out his responsibilities effectively as an American diplomat. Whatever the reasons, Franklin refused to engage these antagonists in public. Perhaps his standing as an international celebrity enhanced his self-confidence. He never again allowed personal rancor to divert attention from the nation's tenuous claim to independence. The same could not be said for John Adams, a bright, able lawyer, who grew to hate Franklin. The two men were thrown together in Europe during the war. A vain man, Adams envied Franklin's social skills as well as his fame. Within months of his arrival in Paris, Adams had convinced himself that Franklin was withholding vital diplomatic information and toadying up to French ministers. He could never quite fathom Franklin's ability to charm beautiful and intelligent women. At a particularly delicate moment in the peace negotiations with England, Adams sulked in his lodgings, telling others that "he could not bear" to "go near him." On his part Franklin concluded that Adams meant well for his country, but that he was "sometimes and in some things, absolutely out of his Sences."
At the end of the day, such bitter rivalries did not count for much. Franklin and Adams put aside their differences long enough to achieve a peace far more generous than anyone at the time could have anticipated. To his credit, Mr. Middlekauff manages to explore the darker side of human relations without thereby diminishing the real achievements of the people he studies. He reminds us that truly gifted political leaders have had a capacity to rise above personal animosity and work for the common good.

SHE WORKS/HE WORKS
How Two-Income Families Are Happier, Healthier, and Better-Off.
By Rosalind C. Barnett and Caryl Rivers.
260 pp. San Francisco:
HarperSanFrancisco. $24.
 
IN THE NAME OF THE FAMILY
Rethinking Family Values in the Postmodern Age.
By Judith Stacey.
194 pp. Boston:
Beacon Press. $22.
 At the recent wedding of my stepson, my husband sat companionably between his former wife (the mother of the groom) and me. The groom, in his toast, warmly acknowledged the bride's ex-husband (the father of her son), who was there with his longtime partner, who sat next to the lesbian couple with their new baby. The new husband of my husband's ex-wife introduced us to the daughters of his two previous marriages, one of whom described the difficulties of living with your ex-husband in the apartment right above you. All in all, a typical post-modern family -- one typical of Republicans as well as Democrats, conservatives as well as liberals, rich as well as poor and, in this case, England as well as America. 
 The dizzying speed of changes in family configurations has made many nostalgic for a simpler time; but the correct response to bouts of nostalgia should be the same as the classic response to the desire to exercise -- lie down until the impulse passes. Instead, many people are busily trying to reinstate a family structure that lasted for less than a decade: the postwar blip when American families could afford to consist of one breadwinning husband and a wife who stayed home minding babies. This pattern now accounts for 3 percent of all families. Yet conservatives have so dominated the political conversation about the family, wailed so noisily about the allegedly catastrophic consequences of change, and persuaded so many liberals and moderates to join the choir that it seems impossible to construe the issues in any other way.
 Now two bold books do just that. The methods and language of their authors differ significantly: Rosalind C. Barnett's research, reported in "She Works/He Works," is based on quantitative studies of dual-income couples, and her argument is framed in Caryl Rivers's cheerful journalistic style; Judith Stacey's research, the basis of "In the Name of the Family," primarily involves free-ranging interviews with single mothers and working-class families, and her argument is framed in an impassioned sociological style. Yet both books come up with surprisingly similar and optimistic conclusions.
 Ms. Barnett, a psychotherapist and scholar in residence at the Murray Research Center at Radcliffe College, and Ms. Rivers, a writer with whom she has collaborated on previous books, report findings from a study of 300 dual-income couples. These couples are not typical of all American households, but they are representative of a large and growing segment of the population: full-time-employed, dual-earner couples. These families, Ms. Barnett shows, are thriving, contrary to the worries of many parents and the claims of some psychologists that children need the full-time ministrations of their mothers. For one thing, these couples "do not feel the gut-wrenching vulnerability" of economic disaster if one partner loses a job. For another, as studies repeatedly have found, employed wives are not as depressed and anxious as 1950's homemakers were, nor do their children suffer. The major source of stress for working women, the study found, is sexual harassment, followed by efforts to "mommy track" mothers out of their jobs.
 Just as wives aren't the selfish careerists of media stereotype, Ms. Barnett and Ms. Rivers say, neither are husbands "brutish, uncaring, lazy slobs who are dead set against change." Today's fathers, they find, are "not the distant, work-obsessed fathers of the 1950's"; most are closely involved in all aspects of their children's care, and when they don't get enough time with their children, their levels of distress rise. Also contrary to stereotype, men's participation in household chores has risen dramatically. Judith Stacey found this in her working-class sample too: "Almost all of the men I observed or heard about routinely performed domestic tasks that my own blue-collar father and his friends never deigned to contemplate," she writes.
 Of course, not all families are as secure as two-income couples. Ms. Stacey, a professor of sociology and women's studies at the University of California, Davis, recognizes that liberals, like conservatives, are concerned about the instability of families, about absent fathers and poverty among single mothers. But she argues forcefully against what she regards as the punitive and mean-spirited solutions offered by conservatives, such as efforts to get men back into the home by restoring their dominance there.
 Ms. Stacey's book is a collection of five previously published essays, and what it suffers in repetitions it more than makes up for in its unflinching attack on the "rhetoric of moral panic and the politics of backlash" in the United States, which she contrasts with Sweden's pragmatic solutions to the realities of family change. The first essay is a synopsis of the ethnographic work with working-class families that she did for her previous book, "Brave New Families." The next three dissect the premises, data and results of the campaigns for "family values" in popular culture and social science. The last essay examines the transformation of attitudes among many gay men and lesbians. Once opposed to marriage as a repressive, heterosexual, patriarchal institution, many are now enthusiastic supporters of marriage and family. Ms. Stacey regards such families neither as marginal nor exceptional but as models of ingenuity and flexibility.
 Together, these books bring us good news that "collaborative couples," who are now the norm, are healthier and happier than those constrained by the segregation of the past. But, these books warn us, we won't find ways of coping with the bad news until we face the economic and social facts. Women who need and enjoy their jobs aren't going to give them up. People who are unhappily married aren't going to stay together. Teen-agers aren't going to have a mass conversion and choose abstinence until they marry -- if they do marry. And members of the impoverished underclass, denied opportunities for work and training, and now being denied even the basic humane supports of life, aren't ever going to be able to live like Ozzie and Harriet; to tell them they should is not only delusional but cruel.

HEADLINE: Solicitations Rising for Costlier Galas

BYLINE: By PHILLIP LUTZ 

 BODY:
WITH government financing declining and competition for private charitable contributions on the rise, Long Island's nonprofit institutions are stepping up their fund-raising activities.
Galas are growing costlier, golf outings are proliferating, and, as more organizations hire one of the growing number of fund-raising specialists, solicitations of all types are multiplying. 
 Some of the efforts have proved successful. But as the number of solicitations grows, so do fears among the fund raisers that they may be putting too much pressure on potential contributors.
"Institutions are investing more time, effort and resources in fundraising, so the competition has grown very fierce," said Jack J. Sage, the the chief executive officer of United Way of Long Island.
"There's been so much consumer complaint about how many times the same organizations and people are asked to pitch in," he added "In fund-raising circles, this is a major issue people do worry about."
Others in the field concurred.
"Charities are developing more and more event-type solicitation," said Ronald Cooper, a managing partner at Ernst and Young in Melville and the vice president for development at the Long Island Philharmonic.
Many arts organizations, hit hard by cutbacks in government support, are hoping that events like galas pick up some of the slack. "The Philharmonic is one organization that has really utilized its annual gala to help offset some of the lost grant money that came out of government," Mr. Cooper said.
In the Philharmonic's case, its share of financing from an important state program has declined to $15,000 from $150,000 in the last three years. At the same time, prices for attending the orchestra's gala have risen incrementally, and will increase again this year, to $395 per person, said Karen L. Barnes, the executive director.
"We just edge it up quietly," she said.
The Philharmonic, whose operating budget is $1.5 million, hopes to raise $300,000 at the April event next year, she said.
At the Tilles Center in Old Brookville, prices for the annual gala have increased by about 20 percent over the last five years, said Nan Gerson, director of development. The increases have helped make up for the loss of financing from the New York State Council on the Arts, which has been declining by about 9 percent a year, she said.
Government financing accounts for a smaller portion of Tilles's budget than it does for most arts groups, she said.
At a top price of $600, the gala, to be held on Oct. 12, will cost the same to attend as last year, she said, adding that the organization, whose operating budget last year was about $5.4 million, hopes to attract 2,200 people and raise $500,000. The center will pay about $100,000 to the scheduled entertainers, the Boston Pops Orchestra and the television performer Jason Alexander, she said.
Asked whether ticket prices will increase next year, she said, "My board would like to do it."
At a gala for the Cinema Arts Center in Huntington next month, prices that averaged $100 a person in the past will rise by nearly two-thirds, largely because of the expected drawing power of the actors John Mills, Janet Leigh and others who are scheduled to appear, said Mr. Cooper, who also advises the cinema.
The event, expected to attract 600 people and bring in $100,000, marks "the first time that the Cinema Arts Center has been raised to this level of fund raising," he said.
A study released last week by a coalition of business leaders and arts organizations created by Friends of the Arts indicates that arts spending in the not-for-profit sector has a significant impact on the region's economy and that arts spending generates jobs, earnings and revenues in many other Long Island industries.
For every dollar of direct spending, the study found, an additional $1.39 was generated throughout the economy. Direct spending by arts organizations generates an additional $45 million in total output on Long Island, according to the report.
Like many arts groups, social service agencies are also using gala events to raise more money. The National Center for Disability Services in Albertson, whose budget is about $18 million, is holding a celebrity sports night this year at which it expects to raise more than $1 million, according to Edmund L. Cortez, the group's president and chief executive officer. That money will be used partly to offset cuts in Federal funds for research.
Other types of events are also popular.
"There are a huge number of charity golf tournaments on Long Island," said Gene Bernstein, vice chairman of Northville Industries in Melville, who oversees operations at the Northville Long Island Classic, which was held last month at Meadowbrook Country Club in Jericho.
Gate receipts from the tournament, an event on the Professional Golfers Association senior tour, go to Schneider Children's Hospital of Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park.
More than 1,000 charity golf tournaments have been held on the Island this year, up as much as 30 percent in the past year or two, said John Glozek, editor of Long Island Golfer magazine. The publication helped coordinate 700 tournaments this season, double last year's figure, he said.
"There are more fire departments having them," he said. "There are more Kiwanis clubs having them. There are still the not-for-profits, and they're always doing it; I think more of them are doing it now."
Some organizations that had never thought about holding a golf tournament are now doing so. One is the Interfaith Nutrition Network, a Hempstead group that collects food for emergency shelters. The group scheduled its first golf tournament this month, said Anthony E. Childs, a fund-raising expert in Smithtown who advises the network.
He said that four factors entered into the decision to hold the tournament: "Expenses are going up, more people need the services, there's less government funding, and there were people who were willing to undertake and organize a golf outing."
While golf tournaments are nothing new for educational institutions, some are considering expanding their events. Dowling College in Farmingdale, which expected to raise $40,000 from its tournament at the Crescent Country Club in Huntington last Thursday, may reserve two courses next year, said Stanley Henry, chairman of the board.
Beyond staging events, organizations are focusing on a variety of different solicitations. At Dowling, the picture has shifted dramatically in the past three years since the college development office heightened its fund-raising efforts, said Mr. Henry, who is also owner of This Week Publications in Farmingdale.
In part because of heavily staffed "phoneathons" and mass mailings, he said, the number of donors has almost quadrupled, to 4,000, and the proportion of alumni who contribute has increased to 15 percent from 3 percent in the last three years.
At the Philharmonic, the number of foundations being solicited has quadrupled to 100 in the last three years, Ms. Barnes said, adding that she considered the campaign a success because three or four foundations had responded positively. One, the Sanford C. Bernstein Foundation, has provided money for ticket subsidies to students, she said.
Like the Philharmonic, religious organizations are developing long-term fund-raising strategies to build interest among young people. Many such organizations are now seeking professional help in putting these strategies into effect, said George Holloway, who for 25 years has published a fund-raising newsletter for the National Catholic Development Conference. The newsletter, based in Hempstead, has 1,000 subscribers nationwide.
"We have had tremendous growth in our membership," he said, "because religious groups traditionally, while receiving the bulk of the dollars given by the American public, have not had in the past professional development people.
"But now that the number of vocations to religious groups has declined in recent years, they've hired more and more laypeople to help run their operations," he added.
The Long Island Council of Churches, for example, has retained Mr. Childs to help raise funds. On his advice, this year the council has doubled the amount of mail it sends to potential donors, he said.
With the increased demand for fund-raising help, membership in the Long Island chapter of the National Society of Fund Raising Executives increased last year by 80 to 200, said Steve Levy, the president of the chapter.
The increased activity in fund raising reflects an overall increase in the size of the nonprofit sector, which is growing more rapidly than the economy as a whole, according to Pearl Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association.
In 1994, employment in nonprofit organizations on Long Island increased by 3.5 percent over 1993, while total employment grew by 1.4 percent, Ms. Kamer said. Payrolls generated by the nonprofits rose by 5.4 percent, compared with 3.2 percent for the Island as a whole, she said, adding that the growth likely continued last year.
Ms. Kamer's analysis identifies nearly 2,500 nonprofit groups on the Island. They are divided into 13 categories that range in number up to 507 -- the number of religious organizations.
In addition to these established groups, Mr. Holloway said, "Charities are springing up literally overnight for all kinds of causes. On the East End in the summer, every weekend there appears to be another charity having some benefit."
The increasing number and variety of groups asking for money has been noted at the offices of some of the largest contributors, like European American Bank in Uniondale, which finances about 12 programs and contributes to many more.
"There are more requests coming in," said Linda Strongin, a vice president, who manages the bank's community-relations program. "I'm seeing requests from nonprofits I didn't even know existed."
The negative side of all the activity is that the solicitations are beginning to test contributors' patience. One problem is the volume of requests to attend special events.
"There are an enormous amount of complaints from donors asking how many golf tournaments can they go to, how many dinners can they go to," Mr. Sage said. "The encouraging thing is that they still seem to go. But the organizations that depend on special events all seem to be telling me that it's a great struggle."
Mr. Henry said that he rarely finds a Monday on which he is not playing in a charity golf outing, and sometimes in the same week on a Thursday.
"It has definitely increased dramatically," he said. "I literally cannot open my mail without finding one or more invitiations for a golf outing, sometimes three or four in a single day. It's ridiculous."
A major source of irritation to corporate contributors is multiple aid requests from different parts of the same organization, Ms. Strongin said. Recently she received four requests from the same organization for the bank to support a charitable walk.
"By the time I got the fourth request," she said, "I finally said, 'please get your act together. I know you're volunteers, but look at all the money you've wasted.' It gets aggravating after a while."
Corporations are also finding that many of the requests lack an explanation of how the companies will benefit by giving, Ms. Strongin said.
She contrasted two recent requests: one from a local fire company to buy a piece of equipment and another from a New York City agency to pay for computer training. Both requests seemed worthy. But the first proposal, which included an illustration of how the bank gift would be acknowledged, was looked on favorably; the second, which made no mention of the bank's benefiting, was not, she said.
In its written guidelines for evaluating requests for contributions, the bank states that, in addition to the proposal's effectiveness in improving employee morale and fulfilling the company's social responsibility, "our determination should be based on advancing the business goals of the bank." The guidelines also state that the programs that are paid for largely by the bank are, among other things, "designed topromote the bank's image." Organizations seeking contributions often fail to realize that "the profit people are dealing with tighter budgets," said Sharon Grosser, manager of community development programs at Northrop Grumman Corporation in Bethpage.
Ms. Grosser said that it is the consensus of community-development executives with whom she meets that virtually all companies are looking anew at their charitable giving.
"Everyone has suffered," she said. "If they haven't reduced their budgets, they are certainly re-evaluating where the money is spent."
Others agree. "No one likes to say it," Mr. Sage said, "but corporate giving as a phenomenon is plateauing."
At charity dinners, he said, "the constant complaint is that companies that used to take a table or several tables now might take one or two people."
No one knows how much money was donated to nonprofit groups on Long Island last year. Nationally, contributions increased 11 percent, to $144 billion, according to the American Assocation of Fund-Raising Counsel in Manhattan.
At the United Way of Long Island, which acts as an umbrella organization that funnels money to 160 groups, pledges for the 1995-96 fiscal year, which ended in June, increased about 4 percent over the year before, to $9.4 million, Mr. Sage said.
He said that over the last seven years, the portion of the total United Way pledges that come from individuals has doubled to 10 percent. All 21 people who give at least $10,000 per month to the organization have been recruited during this period, he said.
Last year the United Way started a department devoted to seeking major gifts and bequests from wealthy people, an area that Mr. Sage expects to be extremely fruitful over the next decade. With most of the assets on the Island in the hands of people over age 60, he said, most charities will be spending more time, effort and resources on this so-called planned giving.

The President We Deserve
Bill Clinton: His Rise, Falls, and Comebacks.
By Martin Walker.
Illustrated. 360 pp. New York:
Crown Publishers. $27.50.
Over the past four years publishing contentious books about Bill Clinton -- most of them highly unfavorable -- has become something of a cottage industry. Although a few, such as David Maraniss's excellent biography, "First in His Class," Ernest Dumas's illuminating study, "The Clintons of Arkansas," and Elizabeth Drew's two indispensable analyses, "On the Edge" and "Showdown," have been fair minded, the bulk read either as tabloid partisan potshots or as investigative tracts on Whitewater. As Leslie H. Gelb put it in a column in The New York Times, "My colleagues and I, like journalistic Dr. Strangeloves, are ready to nuke Mr. Clinton at the slightest provocation." 
 Indeed. Ever since 1988, when the Republican strategist Lee Atwater picked the young Arkansas Governor as the most potent likely Democratic challenger to President George Bush in 1992 and unleashed a "bleed Clinton" campaign, poison right-wing pens and Republican opposition researchers have had a field day investigating "F.O.B.'s." Indictments have been handed out and jail sentences levied to dozens of Friends of Bill, but President Clinton is still working through the briar patches essentially unscathed.
Unlike the hordes out to "get" Clinton, Martin Walker, Washington correspondent for Britain's newspaper The Guardian, has taken it upon himself to try and make sense out of post-cold-war America by studying the life and career of our 42d President, bringing to the task the dispassionate perspective of a foreign reporter awed at the carnival of American Presidential politics in an age when the medium truly has become the message. The result is "The President We Deserve," a shrewd, stylishly conceived narrative that distinguishes itself as the most comprehensive book on Mr. Clinton to date. In unadorned but sprightly prose, Mr. Walker takes the reader on the 50-year roller coaster that William Jefferson Blythe 4th rode from 1946 in Hope, Ark., to early 1996, when, as President of the United States, Bill Clinton "blunted, diverted and finally defeated the surging momentum of the new Republican majority." Much in "The President We Deserve" is familiar, yet by telling it as a balanced, chronological, warts-and-all story, Mr. Walker lets readers judge for themselves whether Mr. Clinton is the best candidate to lead America into the next millennium. Unfortunately, his erudite effort lacks the documentary evidence to make it more than an interesting campaign-year biography.
If there is an overall thesis to "The President We Deserve," it's that Bill Clinton is the archetypal postwar American, his life having unfolded in the eddies of the vast social revolution that swirled around him. Mr. Walker sees Mr. Clinton as the perfect symbol of the great American meritocracy that blossomed after 1945 thanks to the G.I. Bill, the sexual revolution and the civil rights movement: "The first in his family to go to college, he was also the first in his family to go abroad in anything but military uniform, the first Governor of his state to go abroad to open trade missions, the first President whose summits were on trade pacts rather than on arms treaties." As Mr. Walker tells it, Mr. Clinton's story is dizzying, peppered with the contradictions we've come to expect from the Razorback who went bowling dressed like Elvis Presley, but who is also the Rhodes Scholar who "developed a fondness" for the "Meditations" of Marcus Aurelius.
Yet his embrace of pop culture is just the clearest manifestation of how much Bill Clinton has always been in sync with his times; there is also his dismissal of military service as a prerequisite for an ambitious American politician. In his generation, service was for those who lacked either the smarts or the means to avoid the draft by attending college. Now he holds the distinction of being the only postwar President not to have served in the armed forces. But unlike Dick Cheney, Newt Gingrich and Phil Gramm, who also skirted service the academic way, Mr. Clinton is proud of his conscientious dissent against Vietnam. And, as Mr. Walker repeatedly makes clear, it is his lack of repentance that still raises the greatest ire.
"No government really rooted in limited, parliamentary democracy," the young man wrote the commander of the Reserve Officer Training Corps at the University of Arkansas, "should have the power to make its citizens fight and die in a war they may oppose, a war which even possibly may be wrong, a war which, in any case, does not involve immediately the peace and freedom of the nation." At the time, however -- and also because his college friends, including Hillary Rodham, Strobe Talbott and Robert Reich, were anti-Vietnam Democrats too -- Mr. Clinton assumed, correctly, that supporting L.B.J.'s war would someday be seen as a severe political handicap. "Clinton was with the majority," Mr. Walker writes. In fact, he was never "violently against the war," only calculatingly against it. Out of the 27 million Americans of draft age between 1965 and 1972, only 2.2 million were actually drafted. As America's first postconscription President, Mr. Clinton naturally has taken heat.
Mr. Walker offers a unique perspective on Bill Clinton's two years at Oxford, for he attended the university himself then, and his firsthand descriptions are illuminating. Mr. Clinton comes across as likable for his infectious enthusiasm and constant drive, making friends wherever he went -- hitchhiking all over the Continent, reading Gunter Grass in Germany and George Orwell in Spain; visiting Czechoslovakia just months after Prague Spring and touring Moscow at a time when few Americans dared. In his first year at Oxford alone, he also found time to read 300 books thoroughly, Mr. Walker tells us, on an impressive number of varied subjects.
As for the infamous marijuana cigarette, Mr. Walker insists that Mr. Clinton really didn't inhale: he was allergic to smoke. Besides, Mr. Walker asserts, marijuana was not readily available in Britain during the 1960's; what Mr. Clinton actually put to his lips was a hand-rolled cigarette laced with crumbled hashish. "His Oxford acquaintances were amazed at the mockery Clinton inspired for saying 'I didn't inhale' during his campaign," Mr. Walker writes. "Technically, it was true."
A t times "The President We Deserve" reads like a primer for Europeans who can't keep up with American scandals or comprehend where the hard politics diverges from innuendo. And here Mr. Walker is at his journalistic best, assessing Clinton Administration policy making by meticulously following its downs and ups, from the withdrawal of Zoe Baird's nomination as Attorney General two days after the Inauguration to the signing of a free-trade treaty of intent with the European Union on Dec. 1, 1995. In his highest note, Mr. Walker credits the Clinton Administration with charting "America's new international role in the aftermath of the cold war, as the linchpin of a free-trading global economy." According to Mr. Walker, Mr. Clinton's greatest historical achievement has been to expand what George Bush first envisioned: a central United States role in forging a new world order of open-market democracies. Refreshingly, Mr. Walker gives more consideration to Mr. Clinton's summit meetings with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia than he does to his $200 haircut on the runway at Los Angeles International Airport. This constant focus on substance casts a more favorable light on Mr. Clinton; the "character issue" begins to look feeble next to his handling of the Oklahoma City terrorist bombing, Congress's passage of the North American free-trade pact, his response to Mexico's economic collapse, peace talks in Northern Ireland, the threat of $1 billion in sanctions against China and the Bosnian peace agreement.
In the end, the political portrait that emerges is not so much that of a "New Democrat" as that of a traditional liberal Republican President. "In setting the course for the new international consensus of free-trading internationalism, and for the new domestic consensus around leaner and meaner government," Mr. Walker believes, Mr. Clinton "had strong grounds to claim his right to reelection." Reading "The President We Deserve" leaves the voter with a renewed understanding that only a second term will tell whether he can make that leaner government acceptable for most Americans. "Having acquiesced in the great shrinkage of the New Deal and Great Society," Mr. Walker concludes, "he had still to show that activist government could be made to work."

HEADLINE: Why Pour Money Into Failed Amtrak System?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Trains Are Leaving" (editorial, Sept. 20) concludes by endorsing a failed strategy: Amtrak's decades-long effort to maintain a "national rail passenger system." 
 A strategy that makes sense would recognize that high-speed passenger rail is economically viable only in high-density corridors, and over relatively short distances (under three hours).
Longer distances are served at half the cost or less by the world's best air passenger system and bus systems.
To accomplish such a strategic shift, we need to change the model. Amtrak must become a holding company. Its mission would be to develop a 20-year plan to build the right-of-ways, to purchase rolling-stock technology from Europe or Asia and to arrange to have it manufactured and/or assembled here.
When each route system was complete, a long-term operating lease with a private company would be negotiated.
We can assume that the airlines would bid on these routes, since they already have the reservation systems, personnel and training programs to be a low-cost provider.
The public sector would get a return on the capital employed and the traveling public would get the benefits of a first-rate system operated by the private sector for profit.
This approach would reduce congestion at the airports serving these corridors as well as reduce noise and air pollution.
Financing would have to come from the Highway Trust Fund and the monies saved from the reduced demand for airport expansion. It can be done, but it will take a fresh approach.

Families on the Edge

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The navy blue sweater of 3-year-old Timothy Dixon was saturated from the steady rain. No one paid much attention. Soggy clothing is one of the hazards of being homeless. Timothy was with his mother, Kim Dixon, his brother, Byron, 10, and his sister, Keisha, 8, in a downpour outside the city's Emergency Assistance Unit, a chaotic place in the Bronx where homeless families go to seek shelter and eventually, they hope, a subsidized apartment.
The wind was blowing in strong, cold gusts from the direction of the Triborough Bridge. Less than a dozen blocks away fans were heading toward Yankee Stadium for a game that would be rained out. It was an ugly afternoon, and you could tell by the eyes of the people milling about the E.A.U., some with their belongings in black garbage bags, that the prospects for the evening were no better. 
Timothy did a little dance on the sidewalk. Then he darted several yards away from his mother. Then he ran back.
"Trying to keep warm," somebody said.
Kim Dixon held a cigarette in her hand. "We've got no place to go now," she said. She gestured toward the E.A.U. "They got roaches in there and you have to sleep on the hard floor but what else can we do? Can't stay out here."
She said she fled with her children from their home in Atlanta after her daughter was molested by a relative. The family stayed with a sister-in-law in the Bronx for a while, in a grossly overcrowded apartment, but that situation became untenable.
"She put us out," said Ms. Dixon.
Timothy darted off again.
"Come here, son!"
Byron and Keisha stood quietly beside their mother. Ms. Dixon took a drag from her cigarette. Byron kept an eye on his brother. He looked around quizzically from time to time, but he didn't say anything. Keisha's gaze never seemed to move. She stared without expression down the rainy street.
Quietly, disastrously, the number of homeless children in New York City is growing. A study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania showed that family homelessness in New York increased from 1990 to 1995, and that the largest increase by age group -- 9 percent -- was among children 9 years old and younger.
"These are families that have used up all of their resources," said Gretchen Buchenholz, executive director of the Association to Benefit Children. "They have been sleeping on floors with friends or relatives, or they are fleeing domestic violence. These are very, very poor families and their kids suffer terribly from being homeless. They lag developmentally. Their language skills can be delayed. They don't get enough to eat. They suffer physically, cognitively and emotionally."
"Basically," said Steven Banks, who heads the Homeless Family Rights Project of the Legal Aid Society, "we are creating a lost generation of children who simply do not know what it is like to be in stable housing circumstances."
Most of these worn-down, nomadic and nearly worn-out families are black, and most are refugees from the daily combat of Harlem, the South Bronx or Bedford-Stuyvesant/ East New York.
The main reason they end up doubled and tripled up in apartments with relatives and friends is that they have been unable to earn enough to bring rents in even those devastated areas within their reach. The first problem is finding any work at all. The second problem is that entry-level work does not pay enough to cover Harlem, South Bronx or Bed-Stuy rents for a family of four or five.
These are crazy-making problems. The families exist on the edge. There is nothing to cushion their fall. A fire, or a broken water pipe, or a collapsed roof, or a physical injury, or the loss of a job, or a bout with depression can hurl everybody into the abyss. Moreover, families that live doubled or tripled up with relatives in apartments crammed with a dozen people or more have, by definition, overstayed their welcome. They are always just one argument, just one fight, just one ill-conceived comment away from the sidewalk.
Employment is the essential issue here. There's an economic depression in the inner cities.
But that's old news. No one is paying much attention.

In Service Of Amazon, Composers Of Brazil

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
The Amanakaa Amazon Network, which takes its name from the Tupi Indian word for rain forest, has been raising money to preserve 150,000 square miles of Brazilian rain forest since 1990. One of the network's activities is an annual Amazon Week in New York, the seventh of which began on Saturday evening.
Most of the events are lectures and panel discussions about the ecology and economics of the region, and are to be held at the National Museum of the American Indian. But the series is framed by music. The Brooklyn Philharmonic played an opening concert of Brazilian classical music at Alice Tully Hall. And the week is to end with a folk music and dance festival at the World Trade Center on Saturday from noon to 8 P.M. 
 The Brooklyn players were led by Silvio Barbato, a Brazilian conductor in his mid-30's, who compensated for the lack of program notes by speaking briefly about each work. It was a surprisingly staid affair. Only last spring the American Composers Orchestra demonstrated the variety, scope and distinctive character of Brazilian concert music in its Sonidos de las Americas series, but works presented here did little more than pay homage to European and North American models.
The bright coloration and complex rhythms that contemporary Brazilian composers have used to create a national style were nowhere in evidence, and where folk themes were used, they were subordinated entirely to the warm textures of conventional string writing.
Claudio Santoro, for example, was described as a composer intent on giving Brazilian music its own voice, yet his 1954 "Canto Amor e Paz" says more about the international neo-Classical movement of the 1950's than about Brazil. Most of Heitor Villa-Lobos's "Bachianas Brasileiras" find common ground between Bach themes and Brazilian folk music, but the one offered here -- No. 9, a Prelude and Fugue -- is the most straightforwardly Bachian of the series.
The final two works on the program were by Antonio Carlos Gomes, a composer who flourished in the second half of the 19th century, a time when the notion of a Brazilian style was hardly a twinkle in composers' eyes. And indeed, in his Sonata in D, a string orchestra work from the 1890's, his writing draws uninhibitedly on Mozart and Beethoven, with a touch of Puccini in its slow movement. Gomes had studied in Milan and composed operas for La Scala and other Milanese houses.
To close the concert, Aprile Millo brought a measure of slightly wobbly intensity to "Quale Orrible Paccato," a pretty but unremarkable aria from Gomes's 1873 "Fosca."
Mr. Barbato worked hard to bring out the spark in this music. The Brooklyn players cooperated intermittently, producing a lovely, rounded sound in the Gomes works, but letting their intonation slip occasionally in the Santoro and Villa-Lobos scores.

HEADLINE: College Skyboxes Curb Elbow-to-Elbow Democracy

BYLINE: By ROBERT BRYCE 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Sept. 22

 BODY:
College football teams have long relied on marching bands, cheerleaders and winning teams to sell tickets and generate revenue. While nothing will ever take the place of a winning record, colleges across the country are adopting a more reliable, and more controversial, source of cash: those exclusive enclosed seats in the stratosphere of sports stadiums known as skyboxes.
Once the ultimate status symbol of professional sports, skyboxes are proliferating in the college game. Nearly three dozen universities in six conferences now have the private boxes, and half a dozen more are planning to add them. 
 "It's a creeping and disturbing trend," Edward J. Blakely, dean of the planning and development school at the University of Southern California, said recently in a telephone interview. Mr. Blakely, who is writing a book about exclusive communities with restricted access for the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, said that sports stadiums had been one of the last places where Americans shared a common space.
Skyboxes, he said, are the sporting equivalent of residential communities that rely on gates and security fences to keep nonresidents out. "It used to be the regular guy at the ball park could sit next to the corporate C.E.O.," Mr. Blakely said. "Not anymore. This is the privatization of public space."
The private boxes are popular at colleges for the same reason they are popular at the professional level: money. A college stadium skybox that seats from 8 to 50 can cost $8,000 to $80,000 a season.
"The ability to raise additional revenue is the main and only reason" for skyboxes, said Dave Heeke, an associate athletic director at the University of Oregon, which put 11 of the boxes in its football stadium in 1991. Mr. Heeke pointed out that the miniature suites offered a college's supporters more than a comfortable vantage point. The amenities may include catered meals and color television. And most of the cost of a skybox is tax deductible because it is classified as a contribution to a college athletic program.
Numerous state-supported schools known for their football prowess have installed skyboxes, including the Universities of Florida, Georgia, Iowa and Arizona. In the last few months, the University of Texas here, a member of the new Big 12 Conference, announced that it would build 64 skyboxes in its football stadium. The University of Nebraska, another member of the Big 12, which has won two consecutive national football championships, announced plans to build 40 of the boxes.
The private boxes above the common seating at college sports events are not limited to football. Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., and the University of Nevada at Las Vegas have the private suites at their basketball arenas. Texas Tech University in Lubbock has skyboxes in its new baseball stadium.
Bill Dorsey, executive director of the Cincinnati-based Association of Luxury Suite Directors, said no one should be surprised that skyboxes were playing a bigger role at the amateur level. "College sports are big business," said Mr. Dorsey, whose association of about 350 members is made up of concerns that lease the boxes as well as the caterers that serve them.
"In certain states, the colleges are bigger than the pro teams," Mr. Dorsey said. "For instance, the University of Nebraska takes the place of a pro team. It's what the whole state of Nebraska focuses on."
The University of Nebraska is planning to charge a minimum of $75,000 a year for a skybox, with 20 seats. At that price, with six home games, a seat in one of the boxes at a Nebraska football game will cost $625. By comparison, a ticket in the stands is $28 to the public and half that for students.
In some cases, college skyboxes cost as much as or more than those in professional sports. According to figures from Mr. Dorsey's association, the most expensive skybox at Lambeau Field, home of the National Football League's Green Bay Packers, leases for $25,000 a year.
The most expensive skybox at the Thomas & Mack Center, where the University of Nevada at Las Vegas plays basketball, costs $80,000 a year. Students, however, are admitted to home games free.
Robert Baade, an economics professor at Lake Forest College in Illinois, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year about the problems associated with financing new sports stadiums. Like Mr. Blakely, he questions the trend toward the exclusive boxes.
"Stadiums have a finite amount of space," Mr. Baade said in a recent telephone interview. "If you devote more and more seating to preferential customers, what do you have left for the ordinary public? I think it means sports spectating is becoming a far less democratic activity."
The president of the student government at the University of Texas, Jeff Tsai, said that he would oppose the private boxes if they result in the loss of student seats. But he added, "Skyboxes are an alternative that could benefit students because they could alleviate the burden they pay for athletics."
Texas A&M University was one of the first major colleges to build skyboxes. The university, also a member of the Big 12, built 48 of the boxes in its football stadium in 1980. "This is just another way to provide good seats to our alumni and corporations," said Wally Groff, the university's athletic director, who added that revenue from the skyboxes had been used to build and refurbish other sports facilities. "We just approved a $3.6 million tennis center, and the funds for that are coming from the suites," Mr. Groff said.
He dismissed the notion that skyboxes had created economic segregation in the stands. "The good seats have always gone to the biggest contributors," he said.
Harry Edwards, a sociology professor at the University of California at Berkeley, said that wealthy boosters had always been a "privileged class" at university sporting events. "I don't see it as that big a deal," Professor Edwards said. "The only change is that the athletic programs have devised a way to get more money by moving these people off the 50-yard line in row 12 to skyboxes around row 75."
While other colleges are embracing skyboxes, the University of Michigan and the University of Notre Dame, two universities renowned for their football programs, have decided against them.
"We have had many people come to us and ask if they can build skyboxes for us," said Bruce Madej of the University of Michigan's athletic department. "And there have been unbelievable offers on the table. But we are trying to make sure that this is a college atmosphere and not a professional atmosphere."

HEADLINE: Taking In the Sites;
Companies Reach Investors Via the Net

BYLINE: By DAVID RAMPE 

 BODY:
Bell & Howell's management found a new way of getting out information about its annual shareholder meeting last May in Ann Arbor, Mich.: broadcast the proceedings live on the World Wide Web.
The company's decision is an example of the way the Web is becoming a new venue for investor relations. Investors come to learn not only about a company's profits and press releases, but also its strategies and culture. 
 The model is still sketchy, and many company sites focus exclusively on consumer information and have not caught on to the basics of investor relations. But innovations are quickly emerging that undoubtedly will become the standard.
Colgate-Palmolive, for instance, offers the daily highs and lows of its stock's price over the last five years, a valuable help to shareholders at tax time. And Campbell Soup allows Web users to sign up to receive news releases by E-mail. First name, last name and E-mail address, boom, that's it.
After Bell & Howell's shareholders were told about the May meeting, "hundreds of extra shareholders" were able to attend "by remote," said Henry A. D'Ambrosio, vice president at Bell & Howell for administration. "In the Q. and A. period, we got 15 E-mail questions including 2 from overseas, from London and Tokyo."
Bell & Howell's site also is unusual in listing the names and telephone numbers of investment analysts who follow the company.
Hewlett-Packard, although it is a leading technology company, offers a more routine but fairly complete service, including its stock price, updated throughout the day, quarterly and annual reports, speeches by the chairman, recent remarks that management made to securities analysts and descriptions of the company's businesses, segment by segment.
Many companies link their Web pages to their financial filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission at the Edgar data base and offer an E-mail form for requesting printed shareholder information like an annual report. And often there are corporate histories, sometimes earnest, often leaden. AT&T offers its annual reports going back five years and shows a graphic of its stock price over the last 180 days (generally sagging).
Companies typically distribute their news releases to the financial news agencies and public relations wire services to meet strict S.E.C. requirements for the timely and fair dissemination of important corporate news. But the Web provides a new wrinkle in the democratization of news, "giving the common guy a bit of an edge," said John Williams, senior vice president of PR Newswire, which is available on the Web.
"The information is open to the public at large, at no charge, 24 hours a day and seven days a week."
Anne Crawford, the director of investor relations at Colgate-Palmolive, said her company was striving "to keep our investors supplied with current information about company releases as well as strategies, and the Web offers another tool to do that." The company's site answers many routine questions about stock prices and a dividend reinvestment program.
But more than that, Ms. Crawford said, "we are probably getting inquiries about the company that we might not otherwise have gotten, for instance from investment clubs that saw our site." There are inquiries from as far away as Hong Kong and Malaysia. And the site also fits in with the growing trend of younger investors doing their own research, she said.
Also, updating the information on the site is inexpensive and quick, she said, so much so that many Colgate-Palmolive employees find out company information on the Internet long before a news release reaches their desks.
A handy way for an investor to do corporate surfing is to go to the Web sites of the main exchanges. The New York and American stock exchanges offer links to their members' home pages, making it a simple process to check out companies and industries.
Investors can also turn to brokerage houses for corporate data and special reports. Merrill Lynch & Company, for example, offers selected research reports on line. And Smith Barney, a unit of Travelers, publishes market and economic analysis and lets users search for data on many companies.
 Smaller companies on the Web must be alert to keep their information timely and answer queries promptly, warns Robert Amen, of Robert Amen & Associates in Greenwich, Conn., which is part of the Ketchum public relations group. People who send in electronic queries about a company expect an answer within a day or so, not weeks, he said.

HEADLINE: Appalachia Family Reunions on Wane

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAZARD, Ky., Sept. 22

 BODY:
Alma Watts Waddell surveyed her annual family reunion recently with the kind of tender smile she might bestow on an ailing relative.
Four score of her cousins sat at long tables at the community center in the nearby Appalachia town of Hindman, eating potluck food and talking about old times. The Watts family gathering is still among the most cherished weekends of the year for Mrs. Waddell, 60, but she has been watching it wither for years. 
 "Family is just so important," Mrs. Waddell said, "but so many of the younger people just don't get involved anymore."
Mrs. Waddell's lament has been shared this year by reunion organizers all over eastern Kentucky, many of whom report the lowest attendance ever at their family gatherings. The decline is a sign that the Appalachia culture, based on the importance of family, may be fading, said Ron Eller, director of the University of Kentucky's Appalachian Center in Lexington, which is devoted to study of the area.
Americans everywhere have family reunions, but few relish the gatherings the way Appalachian residents do, the experts say. Every summer, reuniting families flood parks and cram cemeteries. Many newspapers in eastern Kentucky have special reunion sections to announce the gatherings. Signs pointing to reunions sprout like kudzu on major highways.
The reunions were born in part because so many in the area were forced to leave because of the decline of the coal industry. In the three decades after World War II, more than three million people left the mountains to find work.
Taught to cherish even distant family connections, the migrants did not forget their roots, returning yearly to the mountain hollows. But their children are not as interested in their heritage. Hundreds once attended the Watts family reunion, but this year there were 85.
"The older people that was so close are dead and gone," said Dr. Gene T. Watts of Hindman, the family patriarch. "And so much of the rest of the clan are scattered in so many different directions."
The children are not only scattered, said Ron Crouch, director of the Kentucky State Data Center in Louisville. "The reality is that the youngsters aren't Appalachians," he said. "They are Chicagoans or Detroiters or Cincinnatians."
Leslie Larson, 39, was one of the dwindling number of cousins of her generation who attended the Watts reunion. Born in Lexington while her father attended the University of Kentucky, Mrs. Larson was reared in Battle Creek, Mich. When she talks, her mouth forms the rounded vowels of Midwesterners. Her accent has none of the soft lilt of the mountains.
"Appalachia is my heritage," Mrs. Larson said, "but it's not me." When Mrs. Larson was a child, her family returned to the mountains for three weeks each summer. She grew close to a brace of cousins and developed a deep fondness for the area. But the trip became harder to schedule. She had not been to a Watts reunion in the previous 13 years.
"The heritage of where my parents grew up really draws me," she said. "I wanted to show it to my kids. And I wanted them to meet their cousins." But even if all the cousins in far-off places returned, the Watts reunion would still be smaller than it was 20 years ago because many of the cousins who still live in eastern Kentucky no longer attend. This is the trend that worries so many reunion organizers.
"It's really the locals you have trouble getting there," said Creda Isaacs, who helps organize her family's reunion in the area.
Appalachian clanishness was born in the 1700's and 1800's when the region's economy was based on subsistence farming, said Mr. Eller, of the Appalachian Center.
With transportation confined to farm animals and the roads poor to nonexistent, families formed their own communities for the farming, teaching and preaching. And when industrialization roared into the mountains at the turn of the century in the form of railroads and coal mining, displacing many farms, people clung to their families for support.
This emphasis on family ties was not always helpful, a fact rarely mentioned in the current national political mania for "family values." When the region's coal economy first nose-dived in the 1920's, residents were reluctant to leave because they wanted to remain with their extended families, Mr. Eller said. They stayed behind and became hopelessly poor. By contrast, many mining areas in the West were almost abandoned when industry moved out.
Since family was more important than ideology, family networks controlled eastern Kentucky's politics for decades, often leading to nepotism and corruption. A member of the Watts family, Ruben Watts, who relied on the family for political support, pocketed thousands of dollars while judge-executive of Letcher County by engineering bogus sales of road-building supplies to the county. He pleaded guilty in 1994 to theft.
Mr. Eller said industrialization brought better roads, better communication and a different set of values to Appalachia. "So it's not surprising that the family structure in the region is also looking like the rest of the country," Mr. Eller said. "Some of us don't see that as progress."
Still, Mr. Eller and those at the Watts family reunion say family ties are still important here. "You can take us out of the mountains," said Aggie Smith, a Watts cousin whose family left for Indiana in the late 1940's, "but you can't take the mountains out of us."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE CONGRESS;
Parties Bicker Among Themselves Over How to Divide Their Money

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
President Clinton's dominance in the polls and the fierce battle for control of Congress have set off tensions between the Presidential campaigns and their political parties over how best to divide a limited financial pie in the crucial last full month of the campaign.
Some top aides to Bob Dole, the Republican nominee, say they are concerned that Republican Party officials are diverting an excessive proportion of available money to helping House and Senate candidates because they fear that Mr. Dole will lose. 
 Democrats face the question in reverse: with Mr. Clinton comfortably ahead in the polls, many advisers to Democratic Congressional candidates criticize the White House for not freeing up more resources to help them. Mr. Clinton, these officials argue, can afford to be more generous.
While the Presidential campaigns are supposed to be financed solely with Federal subsidies, the parties have amassed well over $100 million this year -- often through their state party organizations -- to be pumped into things like generic television commercials, polling and campaign workers that can benefit both Presidential contenders and other candidates on the ballot.
But not all spending helps all candidates equally. A Presidential candidate may not want his party to spend much in a state where he is well ahead or behind, yet such help could make the difference for House candidates in the state.
"The competing geographic imperatives naturally set up some degree of conflict," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster with several clients running for Congress. "Money is a scarce resource in politics, and the priorities of people who want to capture the White House are different from the priorities of those who want the House and Senate."
Over the next six weeks before the election, the parties have to make decisions about whose priorities govern the spending of tens of millions of dollars. Some skirmishes are inevitable, but they have been unusually intense this year because the stakes are higher. Both sides view this as a pivotal election that could decide whether the Republicans retain control of the House and Senate for years to come, or whether the Democrats wrest it back.
As is usually the case, the incumbent is firmly in command not only of his own campaign strategy but also of how his party allocates resources. The Dole campaign has no such control over how much help it receives from the Republican Party, whose attention is divided between winning the White House and hanging on to Congress. Mr. Dole appears to have even less leverage because of his relatively poor standing in the polls.
Some of Mr. Dole's aides complain that the Republican Party has diverted significant resources to states where Mr. Dole does not need extra help (like Kansas and Texas) or has already written off to Mr. Clinton (like Iowa and Rhode Island) just to benefit Republicans seeking state or Congressional office.
"There's a sense that the party has not shown its enthusiasm for Bob Dole in a manner that we would expect," a senior Dole aide said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "I suspect they're trying to keep the House majority, and we're second priority. There's a general level of frustration."
In one example, aides to Mr. Dole complained that the national party should be directing the Ohio Republican Party to send out more mailings highlighting Mr. Dole rather than leaving the Dole committee to have to pick up the cost -- as much as $1 million in that important swing state.
"For every dollar that the state committees don't kick in, the Dole campaign has to pick up the slack," said one Dole campaign official.
Craig Veith, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, which raises money for Republican House candidates, said he had not heard of such complaints, but argued that his committee's candidates could help Mr. Dole.
"Congressional races are entities among themselves," Mr. Veith said. "They can turn out voters in large numbers that will in turn help the Presidential campaign."
On the Democratic side, Congressional leaders were so concerned that the White House was hoarding resources that several met recently with Harold M. Ickes, the deputy chief of staff -- and later with the President himself -- to argue that they could retake Congress if given adequate resources to further remind voters that the unpopular Newt Gingrich is Speaker.
"The President is mainly concerned with getting himself re-elected, and each member of the House in concerned with taking back their respective body," said one Democrat consultant who is close to the House leadership and who spoke on the condition on anonymity.
"Everyone understands that. But what distresses people is that when the President is doing so well, why do they keep the money flowing to them and not redirect it when he doesn't seem to need it?"
Another senior-level Democrat, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, echoed the complaint: "There's a frustration that there has not been more of an effort to help the Congress piece, particularly as Clinton sits with a 15-point lead. It all comes down to what markets they're playing in."
Some Congressional officials said the White House should free up more money to help Congressional candidates in Kansas and Alabama, where Mr. Clinton is not seriously competing, but where there are important House races. They also say the White House should do more for House candidates in Massachusetts and Washington State, where the President is particularly strong but where House seats are at risk.
Some Democratic Congressional officials complained that the White House insisted on taking too large a portion of the proceeds when Mr. Clinton travels around the country as the featured speaker at joint fund-raising events that are intended to raise money not only for the national party but also for local candidates. For many candidates, the money is much more important than whether Mr. Clinton mentions them in a speech or campaigns in their area.
Responding to such concerns, the party announced last week that Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the Clinton-Gore finance effort, would lead a drive to raise several million dollars more for Congressional races.
David Eichenbaum, the communications director for the Democratic National Committee, said: "This move should put to rest any of those concerns. I know that there have been some complaints, but there always are. People always feel that you can do more -- and we are trying to do more."
Publicly, top officials of both campaigns insist that there are no conflicts. Referring to the $12 million Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton are allowed to take directly from their national parties, Scott Reed, the Dole campaign manager, played down any tensions, saying: "What do I care about? We're getting our $12 million."
Douglas Sosnik, the White House political director, said, "We've been much more engaged in Congressional races than the last two incumbents to run for re-election without facing a primary: Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan."
But one White House official, speaking on the condition that he not be identified, was less patient as he dismissed complaints of Democratic Congressional candidates.
"There's a situation that no matter how much you do it's not enough," he said. "It's a constant drumbeat -- they want as much help as they can get."

HEADLINE: Essay;
No Pol Will Tell You

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Only a couple of months ago, it seemed to be such a political masterstroke.
First, move left to repay heavy-spending union labor by raising the minimum wage. Make the Republicans look like skinflints with their murmuring about job losses at the entry level. 
 Simultaneously, move rightward to embrace welfare reform, which, like the minimum wage, had been ignored when Democrats controlled both Congress and the White House. That stole the G.O.P.'s big issue.
The one-two of raising entry-level wages and requiring the welfare recipient to go to work was a combo of political genius, everybody said. Clinton's popularity soared.
But nobody stopped to think what would happen in the real world when you pushed people into the labor force and -- at the same time -- made it more expensive for employers to hire them. Taken together, the two guarantee big trouble.
Last month, the consequence of the left-right combination to the welfare-laden District of Columbia dawned on the Clinton White House. Political strategists panicked, swung left, and granted D.C. a "waiver." But by assuring 20,000 welfare mothers that the work requirement would not apply to them, Clinton in effect repealed welfare reform in the nation's capital.
One trouble with that maneuver was that it was against the new law. Worse, repealing welfare reform by fiat as soon as it took effect would make Clinton look like the old, liberal Democrat. Worst of all, it would signal that if re-elected, Clinton would promptly bring back the era of big government.
That prospect sent Clinton scurrying back again to the right. Last week, he rescinded most of his unlawful waiver and now those 20,000 mothers will have to start looking for jobs.
But not half of these people have high school diplomas, and most can hardly read. What's one big advantage these potential workers offer prospective employers? To gain entry, they could lower costs by working cheap.
And what is the wrongest-headed thing that government can do? To make it more expensive for an employer to give them a chance to work, especially in a city that is losing 10,000 jobs a year. But raising the cost of entry-level workers, of course, is precisely what the minimum-wage increase does. When combined with welfare reform's work requirement, making cheap labor more expensive is public-policy stupidity.
Nobody -- certainly not the bludgeoned Republican House leadership -- points this out because political strategists turned the minimum wage into the equivalent of motherhood. 'Twas a famous victory.
This came on top of another liberal victory: the Family Leave Act. Beyond abortion rights, the new law mandating time off work for familial behavior at home is the centerpiece of the Clinton appeal to women. He boasts of it every day to widen the gender gap.
Bob Dole makes no attempt to argue, because polls show that mandated time off to meet family problems is a big winner with women. Occasionally you hear a peep from some business type that such government intrusion into the workplace makes a company less competitive in global markets, but that's a lot of abstruse economic talk. That battle is over.
Few stop to think of the unintended consequences to workers, female and male, in real life. The popular notion is to force employers to grant leave for family crises, then extend that to taking the family dog to the vet, then to paying for that time off.
But reality is sure to intrude on this politically rosy social engineering. If one worker takes full advantage of his entitlement of family leave time, and another shows up for work every day, which one is likelier to get ahead?
The worker who is on the job regularly will do better (and be a better provider) than the one who takes full advantage of the new entitlement to stay home. The unintended consequence of "family leave" will be to force many breadwinners into more frequent work-family conflicts.
No politician will tell you that. But ultimate decisions about hours and wages will be made between workers and managers, by the law of supply and demand, not by the meddling of politically sensitive politicians.

HEADLINE: Longer Years, Better Schools

 BODY:
The idea of year-round public schools is suddenly getting attention in New York City. Putting children on a staggered schedule over 12 months would allow each school to handle up to 25 percent more students. That would reduce much of the overcrowding problem. Money now targeted for new buildings could be used instead for repairs, computers and new science labs.
A recently released report by the Citizens Budget Commission provides some compelling arguments for doing away with the standard school schedule. Building enough new space to meet increased enrollment, and repairing the existing schools, would take about 90 percent of the city's capital funds through 2003, and still not provide computers, labs and other needed technology. 
 The C.B.C. paints a tempting vision of a New York City in which all the schools are in a good state of repair, with plenty of classroom space and up-to-date technology. But to get there, parents would have to accept a school schedule in which some students take their vacations in the fall or spring instead of summer. The nonprofit research group also envisions double sessions, in which some youngsters start class at 7:30 A.M. and leave for home by noon. Only that kind of dramatic change would allow the city to close its most rundown schools and concentrate economic resources on making the remaining buildings up-to-date.
One of the great advantages of any change that frees up space through scheduling reform is that it can be implemented quickly. Chancellor Rudy Crew is right to be planning a pilot program for extending the year in one school district by 1997.
The change would be a burden on parents who have painfully patched together after-school child care arrangements and would have to start over again. But even that problem must take a back seat to the fact that youngsters packed more than 40 to a room meant to hold 30, or having classes in the hallways, are not getting an adequate education.
The district that agrees to try the year-round school experiment should also be targeted for fast-track building repairs and technological updating. Parents who accept sacrifices and inconvenience should be able to expect rewards in the form of smaller classes, better maintained buildings and more classroom computers.
Meanwhile, the city and state must understand that scheduling innovations are not a panacea. Although some high schools are already operating on double sessions each day, the city does not have the will to put elementary school students on four-hour days that end at noon, no matter how much it will help solve New York's budget problems. Some new schools will still have to be built, and the existing ones must be repaired at a rate faster than present funding allows. But experimenting with year-round schools must be part of the mix. The city could profit mightily if the experiment is a success.

HEADLINE: Drugs, Guns and Just Don't Do It

 BODY:
After dwelling for weeks on the economy, Bob Dole has begun attacking President Clinton on drugs and crime. As a tactical matter, Republicans may be right to try to add to Mr. Dole's central proposal, a 15 percent tax cut that has failed to excite voters. Mr. Clinton, however, has moved shrewdly to pre-empt criticism on these two social issues no less than everywhere else. The Republican candidate's poor gun-control record makes it unlikely that he can reclaim the crime issue for his own. As for drugs, both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole are right to call for more leadership, and right to accuse each other of ignoring the problem until fairly recently.
A debate about two such emotional issues is certainly welcome. Crime has been generally on the decline, especially in many big cities, but there is much that can still be done to help local police departments combat crime and curb the use of guns. The rise in drug use among American teen-agers over the last few years is also a cause for concern. Drugs are less prevalent than they were in the 1980's, and substantially less than in the 1970's, but a national survey showed recently that 10.9 percent of teen-agers used drugs at least monthly in 1995, up from 5.3 percent in 1992. 
 When Mr. Clinton took office, drug programs seemed like they would be a good place to cut spending, especially in the new era of budget stringency. That was before the upsurge in drug use among teen-agers. As a result, funding is now headed back up to record heights. What is missing is an elevated discussion about priorities. Two-thirds of the money spent by the Federal Government is still concentrated on interdiction, including stepped-up border policing and aid to drug crackdowns in other countries. Unfortunately, neither Mr. Dole nor Mr. Clinton is calling for a redirection of efforts to promote education, prevention programs and treatment in communities where drugs flourish.
For Mr. Dole to accuse President Clinton of responsibility for the increase in drug use is no surprise, but surely it is a stretch. True, some experts say that after the favorable trends of the last two decades, many Americans have become complacent about the danger of drugs. In addition, a survey by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University has found what its chairman, Joseph A. Califano Jr., calls "an air of resignation" among parents who came of age in an era of greater tolerance toward drugs.
These attacks, however, are not so much about drugs as about Mr. Dole's attempts to invigorate the character issue. They allow the Republican campaign to run commercials recycling Mr. Clinton's clumsy comments about not inhaling and joking that he would inhale if he had the chance to try marijuana again. Mr. Clinton's comments never inspired much confidence, but neither has Mr. Dole's clunky repetitions of "Just don't do it!"
Mr. Dole's legislative record on guns, meanwhile, undercuts his campaign effort to depict himself as tough on crime. The former Republican Senator has done little to take guns out of the hands of criminals. It was hardly a surprise that the Fraternal Order of Police, a 270,000-member union that had never before endorsed a Democrat, came out for Mr. Clinton last week, following earlier endorsements by the National Association of Police Organizations and the International Union of Police Associations.
Mr. Clinton's solid record on guns includes standing up to the gun lobby to help enact the assault weapons ban and the Brady bill, which requires a waiting period for handgun purchases. As the Senate's Republican leader, Mr. Dole was in a position to help but instead voted against the Brady bill and opposed the assault weapons ban. Lately, he has withdrawn his support for repealing the ban on assault weapons, but he has not matched Mr. Clinton's unequivocal pledge to veto repeal legislation.
Crime and drugs are highly charged subjects that involve asking voters which candidate they trust in their hearts to come down on the right side of the issue. Americans would do better to evaluate the records that both candidates have compiled.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
Dole Takes Note of a Clinton Anniversary

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: GRAYSLAKE, Ill. Sept. 22

 BODY:
Bob Dole noted the three-year anniversary of the introduction of President Clinton's failed health-care overhaul measure today by denouncing it as a symptom of the President's "liberal agenda." He ridiculed "Liberal Bill Clinton" as an advocate of higher taxes and bigger government.
Mr. Dole was introduced here today by Elizabeth Dole, who came to the front of her husband's Presidential campaign for the first time in five weeks to portray Mr. Dole as a "workhorse, not a show horse." She said her husband was far more trustworthy than his opponent. The decision by Mr. Dole's campaign to put Mrs. Dole back out front came as Dole aides continued to worry over his lagging standing with women in voter polls. 
 Mr. Dole flew 1,000 miles to this heavily Republican community north of Chicago to use the anniversary of Mr. Clinton's introduction of the health-care bill to bolster his assertion that "our opponents have this outdated liberal vision of bigger government and higher taxes on working families."
"That was just three years ago today," Mr. Dole said of the anniversary of Mr. Clinton's health speech to a joint session of Congress. "So don't forget this liberal in the White House who now talks like a moderate or a conservative or a Republican."
"He won't talk about it at the debates," Mr. Dole said of the health-care plan, referring to the coming Presidential debates. Mr. Dole stopped and smiled. "Oh, I'll talk about it in the debate."
Mr. Dole's speech today was noteworthy both for its repeated use of the word "liberal" to describe the President -- it was reminiscent of President George Bush's description of Michael S. Dukakis in 1988 -- and for its signals that Mr. Dole plans to refocus his campaign this week on to the economy.
Today's rally, in this wealthy community 40 miles north of Chicago, was filled with visual reminders of Mr. Dole's 15 percent tax cut proposal. In the spot on the lectern where the White House hangs the Presidential seal for Mr. Clinton, Mr. Dole's campaign hung a circle with the word "TAXES," and a red line through it. The crowd held up yellow circular signs reading "15 percent."
Mr. Dole greeted his crowd by joking about his fall in Chico, Calif., last week, which came after his staff failed to nail down a decorative railing on the stage. "Like I said, it's a pleasure to drop in -- maybe I shouldn't use that word. Good to be here."
But Mr. Dole's campaign continued to exhibit logistical difficulties today. When Mr. Dole reached the climax of his address -- warning of attempts by the White House to use "scare" tactics about his tax cuts to win votes -- the red, white and blue balloons that were supposed to be released at the end of the rally came tumbling down, obscuring the line of sight between the candidate and the television cameras, and supporters began bursting them. Mr. Dole attempted to ignore to the barrage to deliver his peroration, but finally made note of the tumult in front of him and ended his speech.
Mr. Dole's remarks today seemed less intended to attack Mr. Clinton's health-care plan itself, than to use it as proof that Mr. Clinton was actually a liberal in moderate clothing.
Mr. Dole initially supported the concept of expanding health care insurance, but as Mr. Clinton's program lost favor with voters (and as one of Mr. Dole's Republican Presidential primary opponents, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, took to attacking it) Mr. Dole turned completely against the proposal.
He asserted today that it would put Government between families and their doctors, and would be financed by a new round of taxes.
Still, in attacking Mr. Clinton as a liberal, Mr. Dole is attempting something that Mr. Bush sought to do, without success, in 1992. Mr. Clinton's election that year was in large part the result of his having drawn lessons from the failures of other Democratic Presidential candidates through the 1980's -- Walter F. Mondale and Mr. Dukakis. Mr. Clinton, by contrast, throughout his years as Governor of Arkansas and then as a Presidential candidate, used language and adopted positions that allowed him to present himself as a moderate, from supporting the death penalty to calling for cutbacks in welfare.

HEADLINE: A Focal Point for the Well-Heeled;
In New Canaan, Prominent Residents Fight a Subdivision

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

DATELINE: NEW CANAAN, Conn., Sept. 22

 BODY:
When a housing developer appeared before the town's Environment Commission here last month, he was armed with a landscape architect, three engineers, two wetland scientists, two lawyers and his own court reporter.
When neighbors who oppose the subdivision had their say at the panel's meeting on Monday, they had their own lawyer, an engineer, a landscape architect and a couple of wildlife experts. They had already attacked the plan in full-page ads in the local newspaper. 
 All this for a proposal to build six houses.
Meet the rarefied real estate world of one of New York's most exclusive suburbs, an executive preserve where four-acre zoning endures, and million-dollar houses are being demolished to make way for bigger ones as the price of choice building lots exceeds $800,000.
The economics of housing at this level leaves the concept of shelter far behind. An $800,000 lot -- particularly a four-acre one -- does not acquire a home; it becomes an estate. And one man's estate may be another man's dressed-up oversized box, a pretentious violation of the landscape as well as the environment. Neighbors have no esthetic guarantees, only the certainty that whatever is built will be big.
"We all know that with this project we're not going to get just houses," Briggs Geddis, New Canaan's environmental officer, said at the recent hearing. "With each house, there's going to be tennis courts, swimming pools, who knows what."
This subdivision, for only half a dozen houses, involves millions of dollars, the largest remaining parcel of undisturbed forest in New Canaan, and on either side, some of Fairfield County's most prominent names.
The developers are James G. Lucchesi, a businessman turned real estate entrepreneur, and Thomas J. Watson 3d, grandson of I.B.M.'s founder. They have contracted to buy 40 acres of water company land that has long been a buffer to the New Canaan Reservoir, in a valley below the high crown of Oenoke Ridge.
The opponents, in keeping with the businesslike ways of the corporate executives who dominate New Canaan, formed the Committee to Save the Oenoke Wetlands. Its president, David T. Kearns, is the retired chairman of Xerox and a former Deputy Secretary of Education.
Mr. Kearns, like all but one of the committee's officers and most of its members, lives next to the water company property, land behind their backyards that they had assumed was protected from development.
"Most of us always felt that the property back there would remain open forever," Mr. Kearns said.
In newspaper ads, the committee has both called on the public to "Stop Watson," and has urged Mr. Watson himself to reconsider his plan to develop "one of the last large nature preserves in New Canaan."
But while his grandfather had an estate here and a number of cousins live in town, Mr. Watson lives not in New Canaan but in nearby Wilton and is not even known by any of the opponents. As the presumed money behind the plan, his famous name has been used as a target.
"The personalization is clearly out of place and offensive," said Mr. Lucchesi, speaking for Mr. Watson and himself. "We are surprised that some of the noted and respected members of the committee would link their names and reputations to such a campaign."
The neighbors, he said, are "motivated by the desire to protect a private preserve in their backyard that they don't own and that they don't pay taxes on."

A Dwindling Supply Of Available Land
In some ways, the dispute over this 40 acres may say more about the value of buildable land as it grows more scarce in wealthy suburbs like New Canaan, where owning acres around your house is part of the point, than about the environment or the developers or the neighbors.
Many people were surprised to learn that the water company property was being sold, not only because they thought it was protected, but also because it seems an awkward, if not impossible, piece of land to develop.
On a map, the outline of the 40 acres zigzags like a gerrymandered voting district, as on one side it follows the odd lot lines of the neighbors' properties, and on the other it follows a ridge line that separates it from the reservoir and the water-company's 173 other acres.
In addition, the property is inaccessible, a slice of woods surrounded by the water company land and private property. The developers had to buy a strip of land several hundred feet long from a neighbor just to provide access.
Until now, for most people the land existed only as a glimpse of woods far below when they drove along Oenoke Ridge Road. None of the watershed is open to the public, though Audubon Society birders are allowed, and deer hunters -- some approved by the utility, some poaching -- roam it.
The people most familiar with it were the neighbors, who could walk into it from their backyards, with or without permission. William Mulvey, a retired advertising executive who organized the committee, recalls his children exploring its hills and valleys. Ruth Swanberg, a neighbor who is a director of the Garden Club of America, accompanied her children.
"We used to walk back into this property here, with the permission of the manager, looking for wildflowers," she said. "Now today, I've been taking my grandchildren to the same spot looking for the same thing. I'd hate to think that's going to go."

Little Opposition, Then a Public Fight
It is because of the ridge line that the land is for sale; since the rain and snowmelt coming off its side of the ridge do not run into the reservoir, the state classifies the land as nonessential.
Several years ago, the State Department of Public Utility Control ordered the New Canaan Water Company, since bought by the Bridgeport Hydraulic Company, to sell the land to reduce its debt. In 1995, after public hearings, the agency approved the sale to Mr. Lucchesi and Mr. Watson for $1.95 million, pending local approvals for building on it.
But it is because of the price of land in New Canaan that Mr. Lucchesi agreed to buy the property, after several other developers passed. His target was the $2 million to $3 million market. His first house in New Canaan, built on spec to showcase his work, sold to a corporate chairman for $2.95 million.
"I build Rolls-Royces," Mr. Lucchesi said. "I don't build Lexuses." There is not much vacant land left in New Canaan for more Rolls-Royces -- particularly land protected forever on one side by a reservoir.
Each of the six lots, he estimated, could sell for more than $800,000. In addition, he hopes to build at least some of the houses.
Mr. Lucchesi expected opposition at the state's hearings, but there was none. And neither the town nor any nonprofit group exercised its right, under state law, to buy the land for preservation.
When the neighbors realized that the sale was going through, there was one place left to make a stand: the local Environment Commission, which is charged with protecting wetlands.
Running through the property, covering 9 of the 40 acres, is a band of spongy ground through which rain and snowmelt drain into a pond on Mr. Mulvey's lot, then into the Five Mile River and Long Island Sound. To get to five of his six lots, Mr. Lucchesi had to cross the wetland.
Besides providing a habitat for many species, wetlands serve as a buffer against flooding by absorbing rain runoff and then draining gradually, their soil also cleaning the water of pollutants like pesticides and fertilizer chemicals.

Wetlands Become The Primary Focus
Still, the wetlands are an issue mainly because Mr. Lucchesi needs permission to cross them. The greater concern expressed by Mr. Kearns and his neighbors is that the scale of development, when $2 million houses are being built, will necessarily destroy a large tract of forest. And they question whether a developer's profit, and a home buyer's need to make a grandiose statement, justifies that destruction when so little open land is left.
They are urging Mr. Lucchesi to reduce the scale by building fewer houses, or imposing deed restrictions limiting, for example, the size of lawns.
"I'm not directly affected by this," Ned Swanberg, Mr. Kearns's longtime neighbor, said. "We won't see the road behind us. My concern is that, of the 40 acres, 30 to 35 will be destroyed, the woodland and the wildlife and the wetland."
Mr. Swanberg's wife, Ruth, said: "There has been a need for some development, for the medium-income people to live in, and I think that's fine. But these are $2 million houses, and I don't think we need another one in New Canaan, to be perfectly honest."
In New Canaan, however, the general state of the environment is not the business of the Environment Commission, only that of wetlands is. And certainly the esthetic question of what is more beautiful, undisturbed second-growth forest, or the kind of giant boxes that are increasingly being built here, is beyond its view.
"You have to have very good reasons to say no," the commission's chairman, Sven W. Englund, said of wetland applications. Courts are protective of property owners' rights to use their land, and in this case, if Mr. Lucchesi can't cross the wetland, the property is basically worthless.
Mr. Lucchesi and Mr. Watson, meanwhile, have spent several hundred thousand dollars on architects, engineers, lawyers and other experts. They paid $12,000 for a surveyor to count every tree that would be cut down for the road. They paid an agricultural scientist $1,800 for a study on the most environmentally sound way to maintain a lawn. They are prepared to plant shrubs along the road that will provide habitat for more species of animals and birds than are there now.
Where the road crosses the wetland, engineers have designed a weir to let water drain from one end of the property to the other; its floor will be paved with rocks taken from the land, to make it a natural passageway for animals.
The road, they say, will not harm the wetlands or change the drainage. And much of the runoff, they note, comes not from the 40 acres, but from the neighbors.
"I would hope the opposition would realize that despite their passion, this is an environmentally sensible and reasonable use of the land," Mr. Lucchesi said. "But if they want to spend tens of thousands of dollars on an appeal, that's fine with me."
Fine, as long as the market for multimillion-dollar houses stays strong. "If another Black Monday occurs before I get approval and sell the land," he said, "I've got a very big white elephant."

HEADLINE: Does America Love or Hate the U.N.?

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 20

 BODY:
How alienated from the United Nations are the American people? That question is on many minds here as the United Nations prepares for a visit on Tuesday by President Clinton.
The President, who is to address the General Assembly and sign a treaty banning nuclear test explosions, has declined a lunch with other heads of government and Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whom Mr. Clinton has vowed to block from a second term. 
 Inside the organization and the missions of 185 member countries scattered around New York City there is intense fascination about how this visit, taking place in the midst of a presidential campaign in which both major parties have attacked the United Nations, can be made to look cordial but not too friendly.
But while American political candidates are distancing themselves from the United Nations, there is mounting evidence that the American public takes a much more generous, international view.
This summer, when more than two dozen religious leaders representing most major Christian denominations in the United States wrote to senators urging more spending on global social and economic development, relief organizations that backed the appeal pointed to numerous opinion polls showing considerable support for foreign aid and the work of international organizations.
"Average Americans understand that somehow foreign relations impinge on their daily lives now in a way that the cold war issues did not," said Madeleine K. Albright, the chief American delegate at the United Nations. "There clearly was potential terror from nuclear weapons, but the world was held at bay." Now concerns about global epidemics, crime and terrorism make them aware that they are not alone, and they look for international solutions, she said.
"Of course there are people who will always object to the U.N. because they think it's a world government, which is nonsense, and then those who object to it because it is filled with foreigners, which cannot be helped," Ms. Albright said.
Such critics have had a disproportionate effect on Congress, but do not represent public sentiment, said Steven Kull of the University of Maryland's School of Public Affairs, who has conducted a series of polls on international issues.
"Clearly members of Congress have a perception that the public is more resistant to participation in the U.N. or has a more negative attitude about the U.N. than the polls show," he said.
"It does seem that people who call and write to members of Congress, just based on what they say, are wont to have more concerns about the U.N. being too powerful," he continued. "But this is a very small population, but they are more verbal about it, more active, and belong to organizations that mobilize people."
Representative Eliot L. Engel, a Democrat from the Bronx who recently led a successful campaign to restore some money cut from Administration requests for the United Nations Development Program, said that when members of Congress are made aware that assaults on the United Nations can actually undermine American economic or security interests, they can be persuaded to be more supportive of the organization.
He said that New York would lose jobs and revenue if the United Nations Development Program left the city, perhaps for Bonn, which is wooing it. The development program assists poor nations, often helping them create free-market economies.
"We can either have an aid program that insures that there is stability in the world, democracy and the kind of free markets we want to see," Mr. Engel said, "or we can be very shortsighted and in 10, 20, 30 years from now, God forbid, we can fight another major war, or have to pick up the pieces of one."
When Mr. Kull began sampling American public opinion about the United Nations more than three years ago, his findings were greeted with a good deal of skepticism.
Americans, his polls showed, were neither isolationists nor proponents of a go-it-alone style of world leadership. Instead, they wanted greater involvement in the United Nations, including in peacekeeping operations, and more spending on foreign aid.
These and other researchers' polls have also shown that Americans would support a standing United Nations peacekeeping force and taxes on arms transfers to pay for operations.
When some opinion surveys began to show that these attitudes could affect how people vote this November, critics often zeroed in on what they saw as the bias of the groups conducting the polls -- for example, the United Nations Association of the United States, an independent, nonpartisan group, but one that is close to the United Nations -- or how the questions were posed.
Charles Lichenstein, a former deputy permanent representative of the United States at the United Nations and now senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative organization in Washington, questioned whether respondants understood the issues involved.
While most Americans are generous and want to help solve world problems, he said, there are few who know enough about the United Nations to judge how effective it is.
"If you ask another set of questions: Should American forces be put under the command of the U.N. or some other international body in which the U.S. has no decisive authority, I suspect most Americans would say, 'Of course not,' " Mr. Lichenstein said. "If you ask them, should you throw good money after bad, they would say 'No.' "
At the United Nations Association in New York, Jeffrey Laurenti, executive director of policy studies, says criticism of the United Nations can come from either the right or the left in Washington because until very recently, foreign policy was the preserve of an elite drawn from both Republican and Democratic camps. It was a world of security specialists and establishment pundits where "international affairs was assumed to be high diplomacy, not town hall politics."
"Think tanks also had an investment in power politics and cold war alliances," Mr. Laurenti said. "The public doesn't have these same personal or emotional investments," he said. He says this is why opinion polls are reflecting a far greater public awareness of changing global concerns than the guardians of opinion want to recognize.
"The old priesthood cannot keep the unwashed laity from the altar of international relations any longer," Mr. Laurenti said. "The public at large tends to see international affairs increasingly as something from which they cannot be disengaged. They see international problems as something the whole world needs to be involved in."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DEMOCRAT;
Democrats Ponder New Clinton Term

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
Bill Clinton could very well be on his way to becoming only the third Democrat in this century to win re-election as President. That feat alone would give him a place in history.
Yet as Election Day draws nearer, even many Democrats say they are hard-pressed to describe a second Clinton term: Who would serve in an Administration that is expected to undergo vast turnover? And what kind of reputation would Mr. Clinton build for himself and for a party that has largely run this election by capitalizing on the unpopularity of Speaker Newt Gingrich? 
In broad strokes, Mr. Clinton has said he would devote another four years to emphasizing education, to somewhat expanded coverage of health care and to deficit reduction as levers to move the country further along in a post-industrial information age.
He has accompanied his speeches with small-scale family-centered proposals that might be said to make up a Nouvelle Deal of fat-free Government activism in a time of strained resources. In some cases, he has proposed tax incentives instead of spending programs to foster social goals, offering tax cuts, for example, as an incentive for obtaining higher education. And sometimes his stands are simply hortatory.
But a debate is already starting inside the Democratic Party over whether such a modest agenda is needed to restore faith in a party too often associated with big government, or whether it leaves a policy vacuum that ignores the nation's true challenges.
"Whether you have a Democratic Congress or not, there will be a furious debate about where Democrats go," said Robert. L. Borosage, co-director of the Campaign for America's Future, a new research group set up by some Democrats to counter the centrist Democratic Leadership Council. "Everyone's agreed that this election is a referendum on the Gingrich agenda."
Mr. Clinton has been far less specific about how he would grapple with what many analysts consider to be the serious policy questions: what programs to trim or eliminate to balance the budget, how to insure that there will be jobs for the millions forced off welfare, and what to do about impending crises in the Social Security and Medicare systems as the nation's population ages.
Robert D. Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said, "We are at a point in our history where the New Deal has to be rationalized and consolidated if it's going to be preserved in the second and third decades of the next century when the baby boom generation's retirement puts immense pressure on the system."
How Mr. Clinton tackles these problems could depend on the Congress he has to work with. When he faced Democrats in his first two years in office, Mr. Clinton tacked leftward, raising taxes to combat the Federal deficit and trying to sell universal health care coverage.
When the Republicans took charge of Congress after the 1994 elections, Mr. Clinton moved to support a seven-year plan to reach a balanced budget and signed into law stringent limits on welfare benefits. His aides now say they expect to face a centrist Congress no matter which party prevails in November.
"Whatever happens, the governing majority is going to be very narrow," said Bruce Reed, a domestic policy adviser. "That means that the two parties will have to work together to get anything done."
Other Administration officials wonder whether Mr. Clinton could persuade a Democratic House to approve his plan to balance the budget, particularly since it reserves the hard choices for the future.
"The question is," one official said, "will the Democrats -- if they come into power -- follow him?"
Assuming that no recession is on the horizon, Mr. Clinton's budget plan envisioned $279 billion in savings from entitlement programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and $167 billion in other domestic programs. Most of those cuts have yet to be made. And the Democrats have run hard against the House Republican attempt to rein in Medicare spending by $270 billion, raising the question of whether either party will try to overhaul a program that has such a committed constituency.
Some liberal Democrats are mobilizing to cut military spending to free resources for domestic programs.
Beyond identifying immediate savings in Medicare, Mr. Clinton must decide whether to take the politically risky step of revising Medicare and Social Security before the retirement of the baby boom generation early in the next century breaks the systems.
The President has said that bipartisan commissions should be set up to make recommendations for both programs, and he has suggested that he is open to ideas like raising the retirement age or lowering the automatic cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security.
More broadly, Mr. Clinton could be expected to seek some small steps toward his formerly consuming quest to insure health coverage for all Americans. He has said he wants legislation to allow laid-off workers to be able to keep their health insurance for six months. And many aides predict that Mr. Clinton might seek health coverage for all children.
One large question is how far Mr. Clinton would go to modify the new welfare legislation, which imposes a lifetime limit of five years on benefits for any family and requires most adult recipients to work within two years. The President, who signed measure last month, has said he wants to remove provisions barring assistance to legal immigrants who are not yet citizens and to modify some cuts in food stamps.
He has also proposed $3.4 billion in grants and tax incentives to create jobs. And he has recently implored churches and businesses to hire workers who leave the welfare rolls. But members of his Administration are ready to push him to further guarantee the availability of work.
The gap between rich and poor has continued to grow in the last four years, and Mr. Clinton has said the answer to wage inequality is education. He proposed a tutoring program to insure that all children are literate by the third grade, a school construction fund and a $10,000 tax deduction and a $1,500 tax credit to help pay for college tuition.
Aides predict that Mr. Clinton, with an eye to history, would be likely to burnish the peacemaker role and seek a comprehensive role in the Middle East. He has also called for summit meetings on the expansion of NATO and on improving relations with China.
One clue to Mr. Clinton's policy direction would be the appointments he makes in a second term and the balance he strikes between his party's liberal and moderate wings.
Among those exected to leave are Leon E. Panetta, the chief of staff, and George R. Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser. Friends say the deputy chief of staff, Harold M. Ickes, may return to New York.
In the Cabinet, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 70, is considered likely to leave as well. Some officials say they believe that the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, may also move on. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich may return to academia, and Attorney General Janet Reno, who has Parkinson's disease, may step down for health reasons, officials said.
No matter what Mr. Clinton would do in a second term, a victory after the depths of 1994 would be considered an extraordinary comeback. And he would join the ranks of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the only Democratic Presidents to be re-elected in this century.

HEADLINE: Case Study: When Busing Works, but Unease Persists

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
The move seemed logical enough.
A Brooklyn school district decided to make a dent in the overcrowding of one intermediate school by busing sixth graders to an undercrowded school in the same district. Empty spaces in East New York could be filled with children from Cypress Hills, just a 15-minute bus ride away. 
 But the parents in Cypress Hills did not like the idea from the start. Not long after the busing began three years ago, rumors began to crop up. One parent, Maria Perez, heard that her daughter Evita's sixth-grade class had to get down on the floor one day when gunshots were fired in the housing project across the street. Last year, another mother, Sonia Perez, said her son, Maximino, was nearly an hour late getting home because the bus had to detour around the scene of a shootout between the police and a man they said was the Zodiac serial killer.
Whether or not these stories were true, the perception that East New York is a risky and undesirable place to send their children sticks in the minds of many Cypress Hills parents when they are asked about busing. And there are other things they do not like: They say the school is too far away, and since few of them have cars, it is difficult to drop in on classes or deliver something a child left at home. And ethnic differences divide Cypress Hills, a mostly Hispanic neighborhood on the north side of busy Atlantic Avenue, from East New York, a mostly black neighborhood on the south side, making parents worry that their children will feel uncomfortable or that the usual hallway pushing and shoving could erupt into something more serious.
Even with these concerns, parents acknowledge that their children have had few difficulties socially or academically at the East New York school. On a recent visit, the school seemed safe, orderly, calm and insulated from neighborhood violence and crime. And the school, which is 60 percent black and 38 percent Hispanic, is actually more diverse than the Cypress Hills parents might have expected.
Because busing can successfully spare students from many of the problems of overcrowding, it would be an obvious answer to easing the worst overcrowding in the New York City schools in decades. But as the emotional reactions and practical concerns of parents -- some of them who even have other children in overcrowded schools -- indicate, it is not only a matter of matching students with seats.
With 91,000 more students than the system can adequately handle and not enough money for new schools, Chancellor Rudy Crew is exploring options like year-round schooling and busing to fill the 67,000 empty seats throughout the system, some in classrooms that have been turned into lounges or offices. New York City already buses some 159,000 children to school each day.
But the experience of a single Brooklyn district, where the bureaucratic and geographic hurdles to busing are minimal, suggests why even moving children a relatively short distance -- never mind across district lines -- can be much more complicated than it seems. "There ought to be a way to reconcile those, to fill up what you have, rather than build new schools," said Robert E. Riccobono, the superintendent of District 19, which includes Cypress Hills and East New York. "But you can't just plug in the holes. Neighborhoods are psychological and physical barriers. Kids have to cross a line that is regarded as a community line. Is it distance or safety or a neighborhood with a different ethnic composition? It's all of those."
He and other school officials say that busing can have practical disadvantages. They say that parents become less involved with their children's schooling when they cannot walk down the street to meet with a teacher or guidance counselor. They say that busing often makes it hard for a child to participate in extracurricular activities. And some say moving children to other schools can make it tricky to plan certain classes and curriculums, especially those that mix grade levels or use the same teacher in several classes.

Problems of Space, Money and Attitude
The story of District 19, which lies along Brooklyn's western border with Queens, is an intricate web of the issues that, in one way or another, afflict many school districts.
There is the recent surge of immigrants, mostly from Latin America and the Caribbean, to the district's north side. And while Cypress Hills has its share of violent crime, parts of it are considered the safer areas of Brooklyn's 75th Precinct.
There is East New York, a neighborhood that has only recently begun to make up for a series of scourges: the white flight of the 1960's, the drug devastation of the 1970's and 1980's, and a murder rate that until a few years ago was the city's highest.
There are the economic circumstances of the district's poor and working-class families, which lead many teachers and parents to feel that the closer the school to home, the better. Some families, for example, rely on older children to walk the younger ones home from school.
There is the issue of new school buildings, in this case a proposed intermediate school in Cypress Hills that, to the bristling anger of many parents, has been held up for four years because of a dispute between the city and a food processing plant over the land. And there is the district's Mason-Dixon line, Atlantic Avenue, the wide, divided thoroughfare with elevated train tracks down the middle and heavy trucks rumbling in both directions. North of Atlantic Avenue is Cypress Hills. South is East New York.
"Atlantic Avenue is a community line psychologically as well as physically because it is a dangerous street to cross," Mr. Riccobono said.
All of these factors have contributed to a diametrically unequal distribution of schoolchildren. The most recently available figures show that last year, schools on the north side had about 1,000 too many children, while schools on the south side had 1,200 spaces.
"It's almost a wash," Mr. Riccobono said. "You would say that, pretty easily, through rezoning, you should be able to resolve the picture. But you can't. If you do that you might be providing an effective baby-sitting service, but you may not be taking into consideration the best education and you're not taking into consideration the concerns of the parents, and why else are we here? They see a school building across the street or a few blocks away from home and they want the kid to go there. It's an American tradition."

A District Strains To Cure Imbalance
District officials have tried many things to rid the imbalance.
They have moved kindergartners among schools throughout the district, a step that they say is easier to take because school districts are not legally required to provide kindergarten classes and can therefore move the children without public hearings or changes to school residence boundaries.
They have tried to attract more children to several East New York intermediate schools by turning them into magnet schools, with special programs dealing with health care, computers or legal affairs that are open to students who live anywhere in the district.
They have leased space for annexes in places like a Y.M.C.A. And they have moved other sixth-grade classes to undercrowded schools. There were complaints, "but it was closer and people didn't view it so much as going from Cypress Hills to East New York," Mr. Riccobono said. "It wasn't as blatant."
Reconciled to the limited city and state money for building and leasing new classrooms, Mr. Riccobono said he would like to move fifth and sixth grades in overcrowded schools to "any school that's underutilized."
That would be schools like Intermediate School 292 in East New York, which has turned some of its 500 spaces into offices and a moot courtroom. A nearby elementary school, Public School 190, has classes with only 20 to 22 children. Ten minutes away are the bulging classrooms of Public School 7 and Intermediate School 171, which share the same 85-year-old building on Ridgewood Avenue in Cypress Hills.
Some classrooms are packed with 50 children taught simultaneously by two teachers who say they can devote little time to each child. There is no cafeteria -- it has been turned into three classrooms. Children eat in the gym and the auditorium.
"It's a terrible situation," said Victor Rodriguez, the principal of I.S. 171. Every classroom and storage closet is filled with people from either the intermediate school or the elementary school.
"All of a sudden, his gym class is in our lineup," said Teresa Moser, the principal of P.S. 7. "Our children are eating lunch in his assembly."
The school, built for 1,100 students, has more than 1,750 this year. Officials bus about 320 children to other schools. More than half of them are kindergarteners. About 140 are sixth graders, who board a bus at 7 a.m. bound for Intermediate School 218 in East New York and are dropped off by bus at the Cypress Hills school at the end of the day.
That move was begun in September 1993, over the heated objections of many parents.
"The thing is that we were going to be using a school that didn't belong to us," said Sonia Perez, whose daughter, Yamaris, was in the first batch of sixth graders and whose son went to East New York last year.
Maria Perez, whose youngest daughter, Jessenia, has 50 children in her first-grade class at P.S. 7 this year, said she was concerned about the overcrowding in Cypress Hills. But, even though three of her children have been bused to I.S. 218 without incident, she is still not comfortable with the arrangement. She said she has trouble getting to the school to see how they are doing.

The Toughest Task: Pleasing the Parents
School districts are entitled to make zoning and busing decisions without parental approval, but public hearings are required and no school official wants unhappy parents.
"There were meetings and screaming," Mr. Riccobono said. "It totally made sense, but the parents didn't like the idea."
Even Mr. Rodriguez, the principal of I.S. 171, is not fond of the idea.
"It looks good on paper," Mr. Rodriguez said. "But what good is it to splinter a school? The kids have no identity with who they belong to."
Ultimately, the district worked out an arrangement that would keep the Cypress Hills sixth graders as separate as possible from the East New York students.
Their classrooms were grouped together in one wing of the intermediate school with its own administrative office. The Cypress Hills children would eat lunch earlier than the other students. And to keep the Cypress Hills children out of the hallways as much as possible, the students would stay in a single classroom all day and the teachers would move from room to room.
"I think they were very concerned because the word out in the community is that this particular area in East New York is not the same as where they are, with the homicide rate," said Ron Attivissimo, the principal of I.S. 218.
Mr. Attivissimo said the East New York parents have not protested the busing. And despite their fears, Cypress Hills parents like Maria Perez and Sonia Perez concede that the switch to the school has gone rather smoothly.
Mr. Attivissimo said the school's worst problems are occasional skirmishes that do not necessarily involve students from the two neighborhoods. Mr. Riccobono said there have been shootings in the nearby housing project, but he said the school, like others in East New York, is protected from violence and drugs.
But now that many parents have become accustomed to having the sixth grade in East New York, something else is happening to I.S. 218. Busing, magnet programs and other district changes have brought hundreds more students into the school.
"It's created the problem of overcrowding in my school," said Mr. Attivissimo. "We're going to have to talk about another site for I.S. 171."

HEADLINE: Rural Life Gains New Appeal, Turning Back a Long Decline

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Iowa, Sept. 19

 BODY:
After graduating from college a few years ago, Marty Beanblossom did something that would once have seemed remarkable for an ambitious young man from this Midwestern prairie town. He came back.
George Schaefer, a local farm boy, lived in San Francisco for 15 years, traveled the world and became a Zen Buddhist. Now he has returned to work the family farm overlooking the English River in Washington County. 
 New young professionals in town, Bridget Quinn Carey, a librarian from Long Island, and her husband, Jim Carey, a lawyer who grew up in Buffalo, recently bought a turn-of-the-century house on a shady street in this little town of rambling porches and picket fences.
And a fledgling Hispanic community, though still small, has grown large enough for the Washington State Bank to need a Spanish-speaking teller.
Ten years after the nightmare of a collapsing agricultural economy, when many family farms went broke, stores closed, suicide rates soared and young people fled the countryside, rural America is growing again.
It is what a new study labels "The Rural Rebound," and economists explain it by citing a big jump in the number of small-town manufacturing jobs, a stronger farm economy, quality-of-life concerns among baby boomers, especially those with young children, and the technological advances that allow many people to do their work wherever they wish.
Reversing a longstanding rural-to-urban trend, 1.6 million more people moved to rural areas from cities and suburbs from 1990 to 1995 than went the other way, according to a study by Calvin Beale, a demographer with the United States Department of Agriculture, and Kenneth M. Johnson, a sociologist at Loyola University in Chicago.
Many rural counties continue to hollow out, especially in the Great Plains. But 50 percent of farm-based counties have seen a population increase in the 1990's, according to the study. Virtually all agricultural counties in the Midwest, including Washington County, lost population in the 80's. In general, a county was classified as rural if it had no population center of at least 50,000.
"It's fun to be living in Iowa these days," said Bill Reha, the vice president of the Washington State Bank. He talked about the diversity of the newcomers in town, the optimism of bright young college graduates moving back, rising property values and a resurgent Main Street.
Small towns like Washington, with its Victorian-style homes and a town square shaded by towering trees, have an unmistakable appeal, at least esthetically, compared with the now-dominant American motif of strip malls and suburban sprawl.
Plenty of young people are looking at rural areas, ignored for years by the up-and-coming, as places rife with opportunity.
On the first day of his law practice, Mr. Carey, 27, was seeing clients. "And within six months, I had a jury trial," said Mr. Carey, who surprised himself after law school at the University of Iowa by settling in the state. "Meanwhile, my friends are still filing in the basements of major law firms."
Mr. Beanblossom, who returned to his hometown to be a funeral director, has found it possible to become a civic leader in a small town without having to wait for gray hair. At age 27, he is a member of the School Board, president of the Community Chest and on the board of directors of a local advocacy group for the developmentally disabled.
"I shrug my shoulders at classmates who wonder what there is to do in a small town," Mr. Beanblossom said. "There aren't enough hours in the day to do all the things I want to do."
Iowa, which hemorrhaged population in the 80's at a rate worse than any other state, losing 5.1 percent of its population, has started to grow, with a population gain of 62,000 since 1990. But the state, with a population of 2.86 million, still has 137,000 fewer people than in 1980.
The growth in rural areas has been achieved largely through economic diversification. In 1995, for the first time, Iowa exported more non-farm goods, which were worth $4.1 billion, than crops and livestock, worth $4 billion.
For the first time in 100 years, Washington County looks as though it will reach a new population high -- about 21,000 -- by the end of the decade.
It helps to have the University of Iowa just 30 miles away, in Iowa City, a city of 60,000 with a growing employment base and a robust cultural and arts community.
But farming is still the dominant economic force in Washington County, and times for farmers are much better. Interest rates have stayed relatively low, corn prices have lately hovered at record highs, and land prices, which plunged to $1,000 an acre from $3,500 an acre in the 80's, have climbed back to about $3,200 an acre.
Two big, empty commercial shells that once housed a discount store and a builder of metal barns have come back to life as the homes of new companies, Bazooka Farmstar, which makes agricultural equipment, and Engineer Building Design, which builds roof trusses.
Virtually all of the town's businesses have been growing, including McCleery-Cummings, a maker of calendars; Modine Inc., a water company, and the Crane Company, a maker of valves.
Iowa has a large number of older residents, after a long exodus by the young, and two retirement homes here cater to them, the United Presbyterian Home and Halcyon House.
"When they come to us, they might not have lived here for 50 or 60 years," said Ann C. Williams, the administrator at Halcyon House. "But they'll say: 'This is where my roots are. This is where I belong.' "
People like Ms. Quinn Carey are finding that it is where they belong, too. After growing up on Long Island, she said, she would never have dreamed of living in Iowa, especially with the childhood memories she had of visiting a relative who was a farmer.
"Two weeks on a hog farm was not a Long Islander's idea of a summer vacation," she said.
When her husband was accepted into law school at the University of Iowa, she said, she decided that she could bear three years in Iowa City, "as long as it was three years and out."
But after landing a part-time job in Kalona, the center of an Amish and Mennonite settlement, she gave small-town life a closer look. Then she and her husband decided to have a family.
"Having a kid changes everything," she said. "It's safe here. It's pretty. And the people are there for you. What's important is different in this culture, and I like that."
But it takes some adjusting to a life with little privacy and no anonymity. When Mr. Carey moved here, he said, it took him forever to walk down the street to get to work. Everybody wanted to stop to talk to him, shake his hand and find out about him and his business.
"I guess that's what makes it a safe and secure place, though," he said.
Mr. Schaefer, who is probably the only Zen Buddhist farmer in Washington County, is not quite sure why he came home to stay. He interrupted a trip to South America four years ago to come back for the wedding of his brother, Steve, and decided to stay, at least for a while.
Now he and his wife, Anne, a commercial interior designer, are planning to build a house on the farm, which has been in his family for nearly 150 years.
"It wasn't a real conscious decision to come back," Mr. Schaefer said. "But I guess it's been a conscious decision to stay. It takes some getting used to. But I like it, probably 90 percent of the time."
As an insurance broker in San Francisco, he had earned a high salary, but he did not like the work. "I told my boss, 'You know, I hate what I do,' " he said. "And he answered, 'Yeah, well, so do most people.' "
Mr. Schaefer quit his job and set out on an 18-month journey, spending a lot of time in India and New Zealand.
At his farm, on a bluff overlooking the English River, he ruminated about a journey that stretched from Iowa to San Francisco and around the world, and finally back home to Iowa.
"I'll be pulling out a fence," he said, "and I'll think, 'My great-great-grandfather stood here one day and put this in.' "

HEADLINE: Sharpton's Candidacy Has Democratic Leaders Stewing Over Strategy

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
As the Rev. Al Sharpton formally announced his candidacy for Mayor yesterday, Democratic leaders said that his surprise entry into the race would complicate their efforts to regain City Hall next year.
Mr. Sharpton announced his candidacy to a packed congregation during the morning service at Canaan Baptist Church in Harlem, issuing a blistering attack on the stewardship of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and presenting himself as a potent municipal voice for black New Yorkers. 
 But his entry into the race was seen as a possible boon to the Republican Mayor, complicating efforts among Democrats to unite behind an electable alternative to Mr. Giuliani. In fact, Mr. Sharpton said he had not even determined whether he would run in the Democratic primary, holding out the possibility he could run as an independent, siphoning black votes from the Democratic candidate.
Should Mr. Sharpton run in the Democratic primary and lose, many Democratic leaders and elected officials suggested that black voters might be too disenchanted to return to the polls for the November general election and vote for the Democratic nominee.
"In order to defeat Rudy Giuliani, we're going to need every African-American vote possible, plus others that are part of the Democratic Party," said Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., the Brooklyn Democratic leader. "If he siphons off African-American votes, it would guarantee Giuliani's re-election."
Mr. Norman said that his major concern about Mr. Sharpton was whether he would accept the outcome of the Democratic primary and stand behind the nominee. "If he runs in the general election as an independent," Mr. Norman said, "it creates a major problem for those of us who want to see Giuliani dislodged from City Hall."
Mr. Sharpton has always been an unpredictable and flamboyant presence in New York City politics. And the news of his latest candidacy has hit many in political circles like a bombshell.
Mr. Sharpton captured 26 percent of the vote in the Democratic Senate primary against Daniel Patrick Moynihan two years ago, and his entry into the mayoral race has forced many political leaders and mayoral hopefuls to reassess their strategies.
"Given how Sharpton did in his two Senate races, there's a good chance he could get a quarter of the primary vote," said Public Advocate Mark J. Green, now the highest-ranking citywide elected Democrat. Mr. Green said that, under those circumstances, Mr. Sharpton might "directly influence who would end up in a runoff, if not possibly get in a runoff himself."
Former Mayor David N. Dinkins said that he had not talked to Mr. Sharpton and was therefore reluctant to comment. However, Mr. Dinkins said that "obviously this has to have an effect on the effort to unseat Giuliani." Mr. Dinkins added, "Perhaps that will be a negative effect."
Mr. Giuliani had no comment on Mr. Sharpton's announcement, his press secretary, Colleen Roche, said. She said that the Mayor had also withheld his opinions of other declared or presumptive candidates.
Speaking to reporters after the church service, Mr. Sharpton said he had formed an exploratory committee that would determine many of the details of his candidacy. One day earlier, an aide to Mr. Sharpton had said the minister expected to run in the Democratic primary.
Yesterday, several people close to Mr. Sharpton, who ran twice for the United States Senate as a Democrat, said that he would most likely run in the Democratic primary.
In his remarks yesterday, Mr. Sharpton discounted any suggestion that he could not win. "The fact of the matter is that I got 33 percent of the city vote," he said, referring to his candidacy for the Senate two years ago. He said that once he files his papers to make his candidacy official, "I'm the front-runner already."
Mr. Sharpton told hundreds of cheering worshipers that he considered Mr. Giuliani's tenure to have been a failure, citing problems in the public schools, police brutality and insensitivity toward black New Yorkers. "So it is on that basis that I have said I will run," he said.
Before Mr. Sharpton entered the race, the only announced candidate in the Democratic primary was Sal F. Albanese, a City Councilman who represents the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn. But Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, and Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, have already raised substantial campaign funds and have hired consultants in preparation for their mayoral races. Also, Alan G. Hevesi, the City Comptroller, has said he was deliberating whether to enter the race.
Mr. Albanese said he would not alter his strategy because of Mr. Sharpton's candidacy. But he said that "there is no doubt that the Reverend Sharpton will garner a majority of the black vote. But that will not affect my strategy of trying to appeal to voters across racial lines on economic themes."
Many political consultants suggested that the candidate most likely to be affected by Mr. Sharpton's candidacy was Ms. Messinger, who has made black voters a cornerstone of her election strategy. Over the last year, she has campaigned in black churches and has appeared before a wide range of black organizations.
Ms. Messinger was observing the Jewish holiday yesterday and was unavailable for comment. Her spokesman, Leland T. Jones, however, said that the Manhattan Borough President believed that the Sharpton candidacy posed no difficulty for her campaign.
"The Reverend Sharpton can be the equivalent to a shot in the arm for the Democratic Party," Mr. Jones said. "He will bring a series of issues to the fore and energize his base to vote. And that will be to the benefit to all in the Democratic primary and, ultimately, for the Democratic nominee. She is not worried about this."
In the Senate race four years ago, Mr. Sharpton got 15 percent of the vote in a contest that drew a strong turnout among black voters, who delivered 70 percent of their vote for him. In that race, he unexpectedly finished ahead of Elizabeth Holtzman, then the City Comptroller, in a four-person Democratic primary. The results broadened his reputation beyond street militancy to demonstrate that he could be a politician with some level of following.
Two years ago, Mr. Sharpton won 26 percent of the vote in a Democratic primary against Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, with a large percentage of votes coming from black voters in New York City.
But Mr. Sharpton has a host of critics and has drawn criticism for some of his political positions and causes, including accusations of anti-Semitism during the Crown Heights racial disturbances in 1991. He also was sharply criticized for racially charged statements last year before the torching of a white-owned store in Harlem.
Mr. Sharpton and Mayor Giuliani have a history of tense relations, with Mr. Sharpton frequently accusing the Giuliani administration of racist policies and the Mayor of being insensitive to black New Yorkers.
Much of that sentiment was in evidence in Mr. Sharpton's comments yesterday, as he attacked Mr. Giuliani for not doing more to solve the problem of overcrowded schools and "police brutality that's getting worse and worse." He added: "In the middle of this, the Mayor tells us that the quality of life has gotten better. Better for whom?"
Mr. Sharpton also focused on the dearth of black elected officials in city government. "We are approaching the end of the 20th century and there is not one black citywide elected official in the city of New York," Mr. Sharpton said.
Mr. Sharpton came to prominence in the mid-1980's during the Howard Beach case, in which a black man, Michael Griffith, was killed by an automobile after being chased onto a Queens highway by a group of white youths. As an adviser to the Griffith family, Mr. Sharpton successfully pressed for the appointment of a special prosecutor in the case.
He again took center stage during the racial tensions that swirled around the death of Yusuf K. Hawkins, a black youth killed by a white mob in the summer of 1989 in Bensonhurst. Mr. Sharpton staged angry protest marches in Bensonhurst accompanied by busloads of supporters. It was during one such march that a 27-year-old man stabbed Mr. Sharpton with a five-inch steak knife.
Mr. Sharpton faced possibly his greatest criticism for his involvement in the case of Tawana Brawley, a 16-year-old Dutchess County girl who claimed she had been raped by a band of white men. Mr. Sharpton took on the State Attorney General's office, accusing officials of a cover-up in the case and suggesting that law enforcement officers carried out the sexual attack, but a special grand jury later dismissed the case as a hoax. To this day, Mr. Sharpton maintains that Tawana Brawley was raped, then abused by a judicial system that would not believe her.
Born in Crown Heights, Mr. Sharpton recounts often in stories that he was a loud child who learned early that "you've got to holler like hell sometimes to get what you want." He preached his first sermon at the age of 4 at the Washington Temple Church of God in Christ in Brooklyn and became known through radio broadcasts and sermons as the Wonder Boy, a fiery prodigy in the pulpit.
As a teen-ager, he attached himself to Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr., minister of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. And then in 1973, a year after Mr. Powell's death, he began to work for the soul singer James Brown, whom he met after Mr. Brown's son died in an automobile accident. He worked with Mr. Brown through the 1970's, helping promote his concerts and even styling his hair similarly.
Mr. Sharpton's income comes mostly from public speaking and cash donations at his weekly Saturday rally for the nonprofit National Action Network, a political group of which he is president.
He and his family divide their time between an apartment in Crown Heights and a house in Englewood, N.J., where they spend most weekends.

HEADLINE: MOST STATES FIND GOALS ON WELFARE WITHIN EASY REACH

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
State officials are discovering that the work requirements of the new welfare law are much less onerous than they first believed.
The work requirements will be substantially reduced for any state that reduces the number of families receiving welfare, compared with the total in the 1995 fiscal year, and that number is already way down in most states. Thus, a state can comply with the law by putting some people to work and by simply removing others from the rolls, regardless of whether they find jobs. 
 In the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, at least 25 percent of the adults on welfare in each state are supposed to be working, the law says. But if, for example, a state reduces its caseload by 10 percent, compared with the 1995 fiscal year, its work target will be reduced by 10 percentage points, so only 15 percent of the adults on welfare will be required to work.
Since the welfare caseload is down an average of 9 percent nationwide from last year and still falling, that means many states will face a far smaller task in meeting the Federal requirements. If a welfare recipient moves to a job or simply ceases to receive aid, the state gets the same credit toward the work requirement.
That worries some welfare advocates. Mark H. Greenberg, a lawyer at the Center for Law and Social Policy, a research and advocacy group, said the "caseload reduction credit" was troubling to him because it rewarded states for reducing the welfare rolls even if they did not put more people to work.
"Under this provision," Mr. Greenberg said, "states will be equally rewarded if their caseload goes down because more people are working or simply because the state has has made it more difficult for families who need help to receive it."
The welfare law ends the 60-year-old Federal guarantee of cash assistance for the nation's poorest children, sets a five-year limit on payments to any family and gives states vast new power to run their own welfare and work programs with lump sums of Federal money.
The caseload-reduction credit will prove useful to most states. In June, the last month for which Federal data are available, the number of families on welfare was less than the monthly average for the 1995 fiscal year in 47 of the 50 states -- all but Alaska, Hawaii and Minnesota.
New York State faces the prospect of a dauntingly large jobs program, but the state will need to get only 18 to 20 percent of its adult welfare recipients into jobs because of declines in its welfare rolls, which were down nearly 7 percent in June, compared with the fiscal 1995 average.
Drops in welfare rolls are striking in Maryland (26 percent), Wisconsin (24 percent), Indiana (21 percent), Oklahoma (18 percent), Louisiana (15 percent) and Michigan (14 percent). For the nation as a whole, the number of families on welfare has declined 14 percent, to 4.4 million, from a peak of 5.1 million in March 1994.
Evelyn Ganzglass, director of employment and social services policy at the National Governors' Association, said: "It's staggering how much change there has been in caseloads. It's incredible."
Officials attribute that to a strong economy, aggressive efforts to put people to work, restrictive new state laws and a new political climate that discourages people from seeking or staying on welfare.
Many state welfare officials say the provisions mean that they will probably be able to meet the requirements without making major changes in their programs. In New York, however, city and state officials are scrambling to prepare for the largest public jobs program since the Depression, and some experts say it will be extremely difficult for New York to find employment for the thousands of unskilled people now receiving welfare.
But the number of families on the Federal welfare rolls in New York State has dropped nearly 7 percent, to 425,370 in June from a monthly average of 456,929 in the 1995 fiscal year. That reduction means New York will need to put 18 to 20 percent of its welfare recipients to work, and aides to Gov. George E. Pataki said last week that the state was well on its way to meeting that goal.
In Connecticut, the number of families on welfare has dropped 6 percent, to 57,120 in June from an average of 60,985 in the 1995 fiscal year, while in New Jersey, the number is down 7 percent, to 110,700 from 118,883.
In Mississippi, Larry E. Temple, deputy director of the state Department of Human Services, said, "Our caseload is going through the floor." As a result, he said, the state will easily meet the new work requirements.
From 1990 to 1993, more than 60,000 Mississippi families were on the welfare rolls. That number declined to 52,500 in 1995 and then declined a further 10 percent, to 47,300, in the first nine months of the current fiscal year.
So under the new law, Mississippi will have to put about 15 percent of its adult welfare recipients to work, and that goal is well within reach, Mr. Temple said. He said 10 to 15 percent of the recipients were already working.
Mississippi, like other states, is emphasizing work. "When a client comes in to apply or be recertified," Mr. Temple said, "we have job placement people on site trying to find them a private-sector unsubsidized job as a first priority."
In Indiana, Cheryl Sullivan, the Secretary of Family and Social Services, said, "We don't anticipate any problem meeting the work requirements set by the Federal Government." Twenty percent of Indiana's adult welfare recipients are already working, Ms. Sullivan said, and Indiana will get credit for for having already made sharp reductions in its rolls. Thus, Indiana is already satisfying the work requirements imposed on it by the new law.
The Republicans who devised the caseload-reduction credit acknowledge that they do not know what happens to all the parents and children leaving the welfare rolls. Democrats say many of these families sink deeper into poverty. Republicans say the adults will find jobs and will ultimately be better off.
Even without changing eligibility criteria, Mr. Greenberg said, a state can reduce its welfare rolls in many ways -- for example, by closing some welfare offices, by imposing new paper-work requirements or by demanding that an applicant produce additional records as proof of identity or income.
Gary J. Stangler, director of the Missouri Department of Social Services, closely followed the Congressional debate on welfare legislation, but he said he had been pleasantly surprised to learn of the caseload-reduction credit just last week.
Because of this credit, he said, "we're within striking distance" of the new work requirements and may already have met them.
Rose Masure, the welfare director in Maine, said: "The credit is a reward or recognition for something we've already done. We've already reduced the caseload." The number of Maine families on welfare totaled 20,590 in June, down 5 percent from 1995 and 14 percent from 1992.
Republicans like Representatives James M. Talent of Missouri and Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas were determined to set stiff work requirements. They did this in two ways. They established a much stricter definition of work, which excludes many types of education and training that were previously counted as work. At the same time, they made more welfare recipients subject to the work requirements. In the past, many welfare recipients were exempt from the requirements and excluded from the calculations.
States that do not meet the work requirements of the new law face financial penalties. They may lose 5 percent of their Federal welfare money in the first year, and penalties would grow in subsequent years.
The work requirements became even more stringent under pressure from President Clinton, who denounced the Republicans as "tough on kids and weak on work." By that, he meant that the Republicans did not provide enough money for child care and other services that welfare recipients need to enable them to work. The work requirement rises to 50 percent of the adults on welfare in the fiscal year 2002.
Like much of the new welfare law, the work requirements are based on an assumption that the economy will remain strong. No one can be sure what will happen in a recession. If the economy softens, the demand for welfare will almost certainly increase, and fewer states will qualify for the caseload-reduction credit. But jobs will be harder to find in a soft economy, so the work requirements will be harder to meet.

FBI Enlisted in Effort To Investigate Leak at Fed
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has agreed to assist in the inquiry into last week's release of information on interest rate policies. Reuters had quoted a "senior Fed official" saying that 8 of the Fed's 12 district banks were in favor of raising the discount rate and that a consensus was forming for a quarter-point increase in the more important Federal funds rate.

HEADLINE: F.B.I. to Aid Fed in Inquiry Of Sensitive Rate Data Leak

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has agreed to assist the Federal Reserve in a highly unusual internal inquiry into a leak last week of sensitive information that some members of the Fed were pushing for an increase in interest rates, law enforcement officials said tonight.
Brent Bowen, the Inspector General for the Fed, has asked for the Justice Department's help in finding the source of the disclosure. Last Tuesday, a Reuters news agency report from Chicago Tuesday quoted a "senior Fed official" as saying that 8 of the Fed's 12 district banks were in favor of raising the largely symbolic discount rate. The report also said a consensus was forming for a quarter-point increase in the more important Federal funds rate. 
 At the time, Fed officials would not comment on the report. But the effort to investigate it, along with the request for assistance by the F.B.I., strongly suggested that the Reuters report might have accurately reflected the internal deliberations within Government and indicated that Fed officials have decided to aggressively search for the person who disclosed the information.
Many investors who had expected the Fed to leave monetary policy unchanged sold bonds based on the report, sending prices lower and pushing up interest rates.
The Reuters report said the Minneapolis, Richmond and San Francisco district banks had been pushing hard for a tighter policy by calling for a half-point increase in the discount rate, while five others had sought a quarter-point increase.
It was uncertain how the disclosure of the information would affect Tuesday's meeting of the central bank's senior policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee. Analysts said the group might be under greater pressure to make a change, even if members have misgivings about such a move.
The Fed's committee, which includes the presidents of the 12 district banks along with the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board, sets the target for the Federal funds rate, which is how much financial institutions charge each other for overnight borrowing.
The Federal funds target is 5.25 percent and some analysts have said that the Open Market Committee is deeply divided over whether to raise the rate to 5.5 percent. At each meeting of the committee, only 5 of the 12 district bank presidents vote on interest rates along with members of the Fed board.
The investigation is under the direction of Mr. Bowen, the Fed's Inspector General. The investigation is aimed at discovering the source of the information provided to Reuters and whether any criminal laws or administrative confidentiality regulations were violated.

HEADLINE: They Call This Dance the Detroit Shuffle

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 22

 BODY:
From the massive entrance arches to the high, coffered lobby ceilings of Wedgwood blue and gilt, the immense General Motors headquarters here has always looked less like a corporate office building than a seat of government.
Now it seems likely to become one. In an unusual game of musical chairs played with real estate, G.M. is effectively turning the 74-year-old landmark in midtown Detroit over to the city, to be a new City Hall. 
 The auto maker, in turn, is moving its senior executives into the Renaissance Center, a five-tower office complex in downtown Detroit that it bought early this summer. And at least some of the Renaissance Center tenants displaced by G.M. -- possibly including the Ford Motor Company -- are expected to move across the street into the current City Hall once city officials have moved out.
Urban planners are enthusiastic about the scheme. They point out that if City Hall had stayed put when G.M. moved downtown, Detroit's commercial and political life would have become concentrated in a few blocks of the downtown area while midtown Detroit, 25 blocks to the north, might have withered.
"From an urban planning point of view, it's a very good idea to create poles that attract people," said Prof. Emmanuel-George Vakalo, the chairman of the doctoral program in architecture at the University of Michigan. City offices are best located on the periphery of a downtown area to encourage urban renewal, he added.
The real estate shuffle still faces a few obstacles, although they are expected to be overcome. Mayor Dennis Archer of Detroit made the plan public last week without warning the fractious City Council, which would need to approve the move and is likely to do so eventually. And several city departments have recently signed leases at other buildings that could be expensive to break, so it could take many years to consolidate the city government in the G.M. headquarters.
The Wayne County government and some courts now share the downtown City Hall, a 41-year-old undistinguished pair of rectangular glass blocks known as the City-County Building. Mayor Archer has urged the courts to move as well, but no decision has been reached. The city employees actually working in City Hall occupy only a quarter of the floor space that will be available in the G.M. building.
The most serious issue is the cost of renovating the G.M. building. G.M. decided to buy the black glass and steel towers of the Renaissance Center for an estimated $80 million in mid-May because installing central air-conditioning and other improvements in its current headquarters would have cost even more.
The room air-conditioners now used in the G.M. building are notoriously unreliable. Even G. Richard Wagoner Jr., the president of G.M.'s North American automotive operations, a corporate empire the size of I.B.M. or General Electric, has been unable to have his office air-conditioner fixed.
"We had to buy a new building instead," Mr. Wagoner joked at the end of a recent hourlong interview, during which the ventilation system clanked incessantly.
The current plan is for G.M. and the city to turn the building over to a private developer, which would renovate it by the summer of 1998 and then recover its costs by leasing the mammoth edifice back to the city. Mayor Archer said in an interview that the lease payments would be no higher than those for the current City Hall. But G.M. and the city have yet to identify a developer for the job, and real estate experts have been skeptical that the lease payments will be the same.
Renovating the G.M. building, which has marble floors and walls on every floor and walnut doors and woodwork, will be an enormous task. Although only 15 stories tall, the limestone-faced structure is so wide and long it has three-fifths of the space of the Empire State Building.
The G.M. building has been designated a national historic landmark, not just for its size but because it was an architectural triumph when completed in 1921. A long central block with eight wings and five acres of windows, the building was designed by Alfred Kahn Associates, a legendary Detroit firm, to let air and light into every worker's office.
Part of Mayor Archer's plan is to make prime office space downtown available to Renaissance Center tenants because of worries they might go to the suburbs when displaced by G.M.
Ford Motor is the Renaissance Center's biggest tenant, with 3,000 managers occupying what is the company's second-most-important office building, after the headquarters in Dearborn, a Detroit suburb. In an interview at the Detroit Symphony Orchestra's opening night on Thursday, Mayor Archer pointed out that Ford, unlike G.M. and Chrysler, had not built an assembly plant in the inner city. Ford Motor's name, he suggested, would fit very well on top of the current City Hall.
"It is very vital and important that, since they do not have an automobile plant, they maintain a presence here," he said.
Ford officials point out that their lease at the Renaissance Center, which Henry Ford 2d built, runs through 2005. G.M. has promised not to expel tenants until their leases expire. But if Ford eventually moves its Renaissance Center staff into the current City Hall, the nation's two largest companies would end up across the street from each other.

HEADLINE: Rise in Interest Rates Won't Curb Inflation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Robert Eisner (Op-Ed, Sept. 19) is right to urge members of the Federal Reserve's policy-making group not to add a half-point to the 5.25 percent Federal funds rate. If they ignore his advice, I hope they will be prepared to explain to the legions of the newly unemployed next year why they thought increasing the cost of money by roughly 10 percent would be anti-inflationary. 
 Higher interest rates directly increase the cost of producing goods and services by raising the cost of new loans and existing variable-rate debt and implicitly increase the cost of all funds previously invested.
When businesses face higher costs, they must raise their prices or reduce their expenses, which often means laying off workers. Rather than curbing inflation, the result is not only more inflation but stagnation as well.

HEADLINE: Rise in Interest Rates Won't Curb Inflation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Robert Eisner's plea (Op-Ed, Sept. 19) for the Federal Reserve to lower rather than raise interest rates to stimulate growth and reduce unemployment is in the right direction, but is still short of what is needed to put the economy on the road to real prosperity. 
 The notion that there is a non-inflation-accelerating rate of unemployment below which unemployment cannot be driven without inflationary consequences lacks historical basis.
Most industrialized countries have enjoyed substantial episodes of unemployment below 2 percent without significant inflation.
At worst, an economy with an expected steady 10 percent inflation rate and a 1 percent unemployment level would be a prosperous economy, automatically eliminating most "welfare as we know it" and alleviating poverty, homelessness, drug addiction and crime.
Unemployment is a major cause of big government, not the other way around. Unemployment as a prophylaxis against inflation is a remedy worse than the disease.
Rather than balancing the Federal budget by 2002, we should look to balancing the labor market, in terms of as many unfilled vacancies as unemployed seeking work. It should be possible to do this gradually enough to avoid significant inflation.

HEADLINE: Foreign Coverage Less Prominent in News Magazines

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
If you solely depended on the three news magazines for information and just happened to glance at the covers of those magazines when they came out on Sept. 9, chances are you might not have realized that the United States had launched a cruise missile attack on Iraq the week before.
Time featured an article on the Microsoft Corporation; Newsweek on testosterone, and U.S. News & World Report on the best colleges in America, with coverage inside of Saddam Hussein's most significant military campaign since the Persian Gulf war. 
 If international news has been noticeably lacking from the recent covers of the news magazines, part of that has to do with the proliferation of domestic news, such as the T.W.A. crash, the Olympic Games, the bombing in Atlanta during the Olympics and the Presidential race.
But editors at the news magazines and foreign policy experts say there is something deeper at work, that since Vietnam and even more so since the cold war, there has been a gradual but significant lessening of interest in matters overseas.
"With the end of the cold war and the vast reduction in the overall threat to the United States, we no longer have enemies, we have dangers," Mortimer B. Zuckerman, chairman and editor in chief of U.S. News, said. "And that obviously has less attraction to a large audience than what existed before 1990. So, yes, there is a diminution of coverage, simply because the issues are less relevant."
So far this year, Time has run 5 international covers, after running 11 in 1995, including 2 on the British royal family and not counting one on French cave paintings and one on a tomb discovered in Egypt.
Newsweek has run four such covers this year -- including one on global warming and not including the one on Mount Everest and two on the Olympics. It ran 11 in 1995.
U.S. News has run no international covers this year and ran six in 1995.
Time and Newsweek featured the Russian elections on their covers -- Time twice and Newsweek once.
In 1995, Time devoted 385 pages to international news, or 14 percent of the magazine, according to Hall's Magazine Editorial Reports, which analyzes the editorial content of most consumer magazines. Newsweek used 338 pages, or 12 percent of its coverage, and U.S. News had 386, or 14 percent. This is a significant decline. In 1985, Time had 670 pages, or 24 percent, Newsweek had 590, or 22 percent, and U.S. News had 588, or 20 percent.
To judge from publications like The Economist and The New York Review of Books, there are international subjects that Americans could be paying more attention to, such as the riots in Jakarta, Indonesia; the ousting of Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's Finance Minister, or the continuing mass killings in Burundi.
But editors say they are simply responding to their readers, who care most about international news that directly affects them, a criterion that is increasingly difficult to meet. "The American news weeklies are thinking very much of international stories as being an extension of domestic," said Bill Hammett, editor of The Economist, based in London, which covers international news extensively in each weekly issue. "How does this directly affect the U.S.?"
Similarly, Americans seem to care about places like Bosnia most when an American pilot like Capt. Scott F. O'Grady is shot down there. And they care about Asia in so far as they have economic interests there. "The Government and the business community are very interested in U.S.-Japan relations and U.S.-China relations," said Edward N. Luttwak, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "There is no attention being put on Japan's relations with China, and yet what's happening between the East Asians is much more important and will eventually define the economic world in ways that will have a big impact on the United States."
Moreover, except for the Middle East, the world has been relatively quiet lately. "Week in and week out, international news has been a bit less urgent," said Walter Isaacson, managing editor of Time magazine.
To a great extent, editors say other issues have become more important to Americans, including the economy, technology and cultural concerns. Americans seem more curious about matters closer to home -- although a recent Newsweek cover featured an article on Mars.
"We have not diminished our interest but just focused on where we think the more important and more relevant issues are, which is more in the realm of culture and ideas," Mr. Zuckerman said.
James F. Hoge Jr., editor of Foreign Affairs, said Americans were also following the example of their elected leaders. "The media, to a great extent, takes its lead from public officials as to whether foreign policy is worthy of coverage," Mr. Hoge said. "And we have a virtual blackout in both parties."
President Clinton himself is seen in his Presidential campaign as focusing on domestic concerns, editors say. "You have a President who basically signaled to the American people they didn't have to worry about foreign affairs, that the bear in the Kremlin was dead," Maynard Parker, the editor of Newsweek, said. "He wasn't going to spend that much time worrying about foreign affairs and they shouldn't either."
But some journalists caution against catering to a national self-interest that can lead to an unhealthy, ill-informed isolationism.
"In a very interlocked world, to be one of the major players -- indeed the major player -- and not sustain more interest than we do is risky," Mr. Hoge said. "What happens when we do need the public to understand and support -- however grudgingly -- some policies that don't have immediate benefits in the way of jobs or more security?"
While the news magazines' international editions tend to feature more world news, Mr. Hammett of The Economist said the American editions must answer to a different set of demands. "I think they feel they need to compete for American readers with more life-style and consumer interest stories," Mr. Hammett said. "Low-cholesterol diets, science, the dinosaurs, life on Mars -- the competition between them has become such that they haven't felt that international stories really sell their magazines."
Editors say magazines with international subjects on the cover barely sell. "The poorest-selling covers of the year are always those on international news," Mr. Zuckerman said.
Nevertheless, editors occasionally go ahead and do it anyway. "I put the Russian elections on the cover, even though I knew it wasn't going to sell," Mr. Parker of Newsweek said.
Mr. Parker did not, however, put Benjamin Netanyahu, now Israel's Prime Minister, on the cover after his surprising upset in the Israeli elections, running a cover-length story inside instead. "While people may be interested in the drama of it, I don't see it as an event that's going to spill way beyond its borders," Mr. Parker said. (Time did put Mr. Netanyahu on the cover.)
Mr. Parker said his decision was based in part on the poor response to Newsweek's cover on the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel. "It was in the bottom 20 percent of newsstand sales for last year," Mr. Parker said.
All of this being said, magazine editors insist they remain committed to foreign news. While correspondents may have been deployed to different areas, their numbers have been basically consistent, editors say. And while some foreign bureaus have been closed, others have been opened. Newsweek, for example, is opening a New Delhi bureau this month, though it may close its Nairobi, Kenya, bureau as a result.
Mr. Zuckerman said U.S. News had scaled back its staff coverage somewhat in favor of a more extensive network of freelancers. "Given everything that's happened, including CNN, where you can get direct coverage, you don't need as many bureaus as you used to," Mr. Zuckerman said. He said this was true domestically, as well.
But James Fallows, the new editor of U.S. News, has extensive experience in Asia and is expected to beef up foreign coverage. "In an age where information in general is getting cheaper, the cost of foreign bureaus is going up," Mr. Fallows said. "So I think there is a long-term inevitable decline in the foreign bureau presence, and our challenge is to find ways to more shrewdly interpret and explain the impact of foreign events on our readers lives."
Michael Elliot, the editor of Newsweek's international editions, said: "Increasingly, what I say to all my writers and editors is, the ties that bind the international community are economics and business, science and technology and culture and life style. You can't just kind of wave your magic wand and pretend that the striped-pants diplomats' news is as interesting as it was during the cold war because it plainly isn't."

HEADLINE: Banks Oppose Bailout of Poor Lands in Crisis

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
A group of the world's largest banks is urging the world's governments and the International Monetary Fund to stop using public money to help developing countries that fall into crises like the one that crippled the Mexican economy in 1994.
The group, the Institute of International Finance, a research and lobbying organization supported by more than 200 banks, contends that such moves are dangerous precedents and that countries in trouble should try to restore investor confidence rather than seek loans from the I.M.F. or individual governments. 
 The position of the group, which was founded during the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980's, was outlined in a letter sent last week to Philippe Maystadt of Belgium, current chairman of the 24-member body of finance ministers that oversees the International Monetary Fund. Its effort came shortly before the annual ministerial meetings of the World Bank and the I.M.F., scheduled for the end of the month.
Developing countries have become more dependent on outside capital in recent years as investors from the United States and elsewhere poured money into emerging markets, where returns are often high but risk can be great.
The banks contend that by creating an implicit safety net for developing countries that run into economic trouble, the I.M.F. "could send countries the wrong signal, raise problems of moral hazard and increase the cost of capital for emerging markets." They fear that rather than moving to correct problems early, countries will allow the situation to fester, knowing that they can negotiate a bailout. This would delay the day when the countries would be able to repay their private loans.
The cause of immediate concern to the institute is a report issued in May on the consequences of the Mexican crisis for the world financial system. While the report generally endorsed market-related solutions to future crises, it left open the door for continuing a policy the I.M.F. adopted in 1989 at a severe point in the Latin American debt crisis. That policy called for lending to countries in difficulty before they reached agreements with their private creditors.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Light Trading; Focus Is on U.S. Interest Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell slightly against most leading currencies yesterday, reflecting some uncertainty in the foreign exchange market over whether the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates at a policy-making meeting today.
But the dollar's decline was limited, partly as a result of weakness in the German mark. The mark retreated against the yen and most European currencies on fears about the health of President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and optimism about progress toward conversion to a single European currency in 1999. 
 Trading was light. Yesterday was a holiday in Japan and was also the Jewish observance of Yom Kippur.
With a lack of outside economic news, speculation about today's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was the main trading theme. Although traders generally expect a 25-basis-point increase in short-term rates, many were hedging their bets. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
"There is nervousness that the Fed isn't going to carry through with its potential rate hike," said Graham Broyd, senior vice president-foreign exchange at NatWest Markets in New York. "If there is no move, there may be some downside risk to the dollar."
Higher rates tend to bolster the dollar by increasing the returns on dollar-denominated assets.
In late New York trading, the dollar slipped to 109.33 yen from 109.80 yen on Friday. The dollar also fell to 1.5120 marks from 1.5155 marks. The British pound traded at $1.5560, up from $1.5550.
The dollar was underpinned indirectly yesterday as traders sold the mark over news about the fragile health of Mr. Yeltsin, whose heart-bypass operation could be delayed. Any perceived threat to Russian political stability tends to hurt the mark because Germany is Russia's biggest trading partner.
Further hurting the mark was a weekend meeting in Dublin of the European Union's finance ministers, who made progress on the details of changing to a single European currency on Jan. 1, 1999. Doubts about the debut of the currency, known as the Euro, have tended to bolster the mark.
The mark was pushed to a 10-week low against the French franc in Asian dealings before rebounding somewhat in Europe.

HEADLINE: Anticipating the Fed: Moods Swing With the Data

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's policy makers, who convene this morning to set the short-term interest rate levers they control, appear to be sharply divided. It is their last chance to alter rates before the Presidential election, and several Fed regional presidents are agitating for an increase of at least a quarter point in the closely watched Federal funds rate, the interest rate charged among banks for overnight money.
 The dispute even escalated to the point that the Reuters news service reported al leak from a Fed official that a majority of the 12 Fed presidents had asked the Washington-based Board of Governors to raise the discount rate, a separate and less important charge for emergency borrowings by banks. 
 Sentiment on Wall Street about whether or not the central bank will increase rates has swung widely in the weeks since the Fed's Open market Committee met on Aug. 20. That has affected the value of long-term bonds, as shown here in the fluctuations in the yield of the inflation-sensitive 30-year Treasury bond.
 Below are some improtant economic indicators that have emerged since the Fed's last meeting and how the markets have interpreted them. TOM REDBURN.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
Seeing Liberty and Equality as Much Overrated

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:

SLOUCHING TOWARDS GOMORRAH
Modern Liberalism and American Decline
By Robert H. Bork
382 pages. Regan Books/HarperCollins. $25.
As the title of Robert H. Bork's new book, "Slouching Towards Gomorrah," suggests, the onetime Reagan nominee to the Supreme Court is highly pessimistic about the state of American society today. He argues that "decline runs across our entire culture" and asserts that "the rot is spreading." 
 To support this assessment, Mr. Bork rounds up the usual evidence: the dissolution of the American family, rising illegitimacy rates, an ineffectual welfare system, the proliferation of obscene art and entertainment, the decline of intellectual standards, increasingly violent teen-agers and increasing racial tensions.
As for the cause, Mr. Bork cites one big culprit: modern liberalism, which in his view has promoted two destructive ideals: "radical egalitarianism (the equality of outcomes rather than of opportunities) and radical individualism (the drastic reduction of limits to personal gratification)."
He argues that "the tendencies inherent in individualism were kept within bounds" in the past by "a common moral culture and the strength of religion," but adds that "liberalism drained the power" from those institutions, contributing to our current state of rootless hedonism.
In the course of setting out these arguments, Mr. Bork makes some astute points about the politicization (not to mention Balkanization) of American culture and the diminished role that reason and rationality have come to play in our intellectual discourse. Mr. Bork's more cogent points, however, are overshadowed by his own ideological fervor and myopia: his willingness to go to rhetorical extremes to try to demolish the left, and his unwillingness to even examine the role that the right (from Jesse Helms to the Christian Coalition) has also played in damaging the American gift for consensus. The result is an angry, preachy book that attempts to bludgeon the reader over the head with hectoring assertions, rather than persuade through judicious argument.
More alarming to many readers will be Mr. Bork's bluntly worded calls for censorship ("starting with the obscene prose and pictures available on the Internet, motion pictures that are mere rhapsodies to violence, and the more degenerate lyrics of rap music") and "a constitutional amendment making any Federal or state court decision subject to being overruled by a majority vote of each House of Congress." Mr. Bork, typically, does not really grapple with the consequences of such proposals: he does not deal, for instance, with the question of exactly who would impose censorship rules, where the guidelines would be drawn or what would prevent such censorship from completely quashing First Amendment rights.
Indeed, as Mr. Bork sees it, the concepts of liberty and equality espoused by the Declaration of Independence ("We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness") are vastly overrated.
"The ringing phrases are hardly useful," Mr. Bork writes, "indeed may be pernicious, if taken, as they commonly are, as a guide to action, governmental or private. Then the words press eventually toward extremes of liberty and the pursuit of happiness that court personal license and social disorder." In another chapter, he goes so far as to suggest that the passion for equality lacks "any intellectual foundation."
Other issues in "Gomorrah" are more thoughtfully addressed. Mr. Bork argues that the time spent in schools bolstering students' self-esteem "might better be spent teaching them skills and knowledge that would justify self-esteem." He argues that the shift from calls for equality of opportunity to demands for equality of results has resulted in a quota-conscious society in which race, ethnicity and gender eclipse the "achievement principle." And he argues that politically correct theories, which denounce rationality as "logocentrism" and classics of Western literature as "Eurocentric," have led to a relativism that would deny the very existence of objective truth.
Mr. Bork grounds these arguments -- as well as arguments about the excesses of radical feminism and the growing culture of victimization -- in the fertile soil of common sense. All too often, however, he undermines his own authority by resorting to overstatement and overgeneralization.
Arguing that the Supreme Court has adopted the tenets of modern liberalism, Mr. Bork asserts that "we are no longer free to make our own fundamental moral and cultural decisions because the Court oversees all such matters, when and as it chooses." As for his concession that the recent Court has given "a fair hearing to the antitrust defendant, the taxpayer and the patent holder," Mr. Bork adds, it's simply because "the left is no longer terribly interested in economic matters."
How can the Supreme Court be an "agent of modern liberalism" with all the recent Reagan and Bush appointments? Well, says Mr. Bork -- whose own nomination in 1987 was rejected -- "most of those appointed turn out not to be restrained or start that way but then, having no firm judicial philosophy, migrate to the left."
"Gomorrah," in fact, is riddled with contradictions. Though Mr. Bork vigorously complains about the "larger and more intrusive" government that has developed to carry out liberal policies, he seems to have no fears about arming that same government with the powers of censorship. Though Mr. Bork characterizes "the intellectual class" as sharing a radical mind-set and accuses it of trying "to weaken or destroy Americans' attachment to their country," he passes over the influential role that conservative thinkers -- many of whose ideas he appropriates in this book -- play in the national discourse.
Throughout this volume, Mr. Bork argues that 60's utopianism was based on the mistaken notion that human nature was malleable and infinitely perfectible. If these views now seem hopelessly naive, however, Mr. Bork's own view of human nature feels depressingly cynical.
Again and again, he attributes the worst possible motives to his adversaries. He accuses Vietnam War protesters, as a group, of "disguising self-indulgence and hatred of the United States as idealism." He suggests that "judges cannot be trusted with a written constitution and an unlimited and uncheckable power of judicial review": "Most men and women, given final power, will prove unable to subordinate their personal sympathies and passions to the legitimate range of meanings that a dispassionate mind can find in the Constitution." And last but not least, he concludes that "the desire for equality" is in large part "rooted in self-pity and envy."
Thus is one of the principles on which America was founded reduced to an ugly and destructive emotion. It is a fitting conclusion to what is, in the end, an ugly and intemperate book.

HEADLINE: Supercomputer Pioneer Injured in Crash

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: COLORADO SPRINGS, Sept. 23

 BODY:
The supercomputer pioneer Seymour Cray was critically injured Sunday afternoon in a three-car highway crash.
The Colorado State Patrol said the accident happened on an Interstate highway just north of Colorado Springs. Mr. Cray, who was alone in his car, was the only one injured, Sgt. Rob Wilson said. 
 Mr. Cray, 70, who founded Cray Research Inc. in Eagan, Minn., and Cray Computer Inc. in Colorado Springs, underwent surgery at Penrose Hospital for severe head injuries. He was listed in critical and unstable condition today.
Working at the Control Data Corporation in 1957, Mr. Cray built the first computer to run with transistors instead of vacuum tubes, an advance that made the machine more reliable and led to the miniaturization of electronics components. In the 1960's, he designed the world's first supercomputers.
He began Cray Research in 1972. It built supercomputers used by the military, energy companies and weather forecasters.
In 1989, Mr. Cray started the Cray Computer Corporation. But his quest to build an even faster computer using new-generation materials failed last year.
In August, Mr. Cray announced that he had started a company called SRC Computers Inc.

HEADLINE: Observer;
Except for the Pentagon

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
The best of all possible headlines for this column is "Welfare Mom Meets Bottom-Line Guy." Unfortunately it's too big for the allotted headline space, so must be buried, wearing type too small for it, in that dull opening sentence.
The temptation to commit pieties here is irresistible, but I confine the bromidic impulse to noting that mankind must ever make do with whatever the authorities choose to grant, be it ever so little. 
News reporters whose column-long stories are cut to three paragraphs have heard the text preached forever by harsh-spoken editors. Those bred to the Judeo-Christian-Islamic culture have heard it taught in holy places.
Now, however, the sermon is being preached in famously unholy places. The White House, Wall Street and the multinational-corporate boardroom, to name three. The Republican and Democratic National Conventions, to name two more.
These are the places of people who arrive in their private jets and party with the stars. The natural message for transmission from such places is, "I've got mine, Jack."
To find all of them simultaneously preaching the virtue of making do with less will make sensible men check their wallets and good women rise and bar the doors.
Their sermon is encoded in President Clinton's declaration that "the era of big government is over." This has now achieved cliche status and is applauded by millions, though it is menacing to many and misleading about what's going on.
The era of big government is, for example, obviously not over for the Pentagon, which is being slathered again in excess billions by a Congress in love with everything that kills. Whether it is over for the elderly is doubtful. The aged have a ferocious lobby and vote with a passion that terrifies the bravest statesman.
It is people with no lobby who ought to shudder every time somebody happily declares, "The era of big government is over," neglecting to add, "except for the Pentagon." When the crowd that's got theirs, Jack, says the era of big government is over, all they mean is that it's over for people with no lobby.
This bloc sans lobby is now being sized up as a potential source of corporate profit. Last week Lockheed Martin, which makes billions selling weapons to big government (the Pentagon), named a new senior vice president to put Lockheed into the business of running welfare-reform programs for profit.
Its new man is Gerald Miller, former director of Michigan's reformed welfare program. "The private sector will ultimately run these programs," Mr. Miller told a reporter, not forgetting to add, "The era of big government is over."
Other corporate giants eyeing poverty's potential profits include I.B.M. and E.D.S., the computing company created by Ross Perot. Presumably the states, which will now handle the welfare problem, would contract with corporations to do the job.
It is not unreasonable to suppose that Lockheed, say, needing to please Wall Street by showing a constant rise in quarterly profits, would make some cruel judgments when moms apply for welfare. Such is the nature of the marketplace economy, now enshrined as the source of all that is good in American life.
Will Welfare Mom Rejected By Bottom-Line Guy be allowed to appeal to higher powers? It's too soon to know. The model of what might be expected may be found in the infringement by insurance companies and H.M.O.'s on doctors' authority for health care. Corporate bureaucrats now often control doctors' freedom to prescribe treatment for patients. Health-industry stocks are booming, thanks to this bottom-line approach to medicine.
The enthusiasm for the end of big government (except the Pentagon) has also infected Wall Street with ideas for "privatizing" Social Security. And why not? There is real money to be made at the stocks-and-bonds casino if brokerage companies handle even a small percentage of the billions coughed up annually by people paying Social Security taxes.
If the era of big government is truly over (except for the Pentagon), it is because Washington -- Clinton, Congress and all -- has washed its hands of government's toughest problems with a prayer that shrewd bottom-line guys will find a way to convert human misfortune into good numbers for Wall Street.

HEADLINE: Ranchers Ride to the Defense Of Mountaintop 'Sky Islands'

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

DATELINE: DOUGLAS, Ariz.

 BODY:
WARNER GLENN's dogs picked up the jaguar's scent when the big spotted cat was almost within sight of the canyon where Geronimo surrendered 110 years ago, here in one of the most unusual landscapes of North America: an archipelago of magnificent mountain forests and grasslands rising from the desert like islands from the sea. They are called sky islands, and they are home to one of the richest panoplies of living creatures on the continent.
Jaguars are rarely seen, though, and when the roaring predator was brought to bay after a five-mile, three-hour chase, it was a highlight of Mr. Glenn's life. Tall, lean and leathery at 60, he is a fourth-generation cattle rancher who gets up at 4 A.M., wears chaps to work, guides hunters, is a registered Republican and displays a full-length poster of John Wayne in his house. But Mr. Glenn is a different sort of cattleman -- a cowboy environmentalist and a leader of a group of ranchers who are writing a remarkable new chapter in conservation here on the Arizona-New Mexico border. 
 So instead of shooting the jaguar that day last March, as ranchers have almost always done, he took photographs and let him go. Since then Mr. Glenn has been as fiercely protective of the cat as of the landscape in which it was tracked down. The jaguar "is here because he likes what he's found -- plenty of game and not very many people, and that's the way we'd like to keep it," he said during a break in a trail ride on horseback to the top of the Peloncillo Mountains, one of the sky islands, from where he traced the cross-country route the chase had taken.
At a time when bitter conflict often convulses the range, Mr. Glenn and some of his rancher neighbors have taken the initiative in creating a working alliance with conservationists and government agencies, their former adversaries. Spurred by a common interest in improving the health of the range and preventing it from being cut up into subdivisions, the Malpai Borderlands Group, as the alliance is called, and its new allies aim to cooperate in managing nearly a million acres of ranch land, divided into more than 30 ranches, for ecological as well as economic values. Only in this way, the ranchers believe, can ranching be sustained in the long term.
Already, the once-hostile groups are working together in a science-based effort to prevent overgrazing, restore the landscape, preserve endangered species and rejuvenate grasslands by reintroducing necessary ecological processes like cleansing fires.
This distinctive alliance has been forged on behalf of an equally distinctive landscape. From the top of the Peloncillos on that trail ride a few days ago, a September sun illuminated the blue peaks of three other sky islands: the Chiricahua Mountains, onetime stronghold of Geronimo's Apaches, 30 miles to the north; the Animas range just to the east and outliers of Mexico's Sierra Madre a few miles to the south.
In all, there are some 40 sky islands in southern Arizona and New Mexico and northern Mexico, where they rise as high as about 10,000 feet above sea level and 6,000 feet above the desert "sea." Neither Rockies nor Sierra Madre, they are a geological and biological province all their own. Here, plants and animals from the northern United States and Mexico both reach the limits of their distribution. In the lower elevations, eastern species mix with western ones.
All mingle with some 60 species found nowhere else, in many instances having survived here while mountain ranges farther north were wiped clean of life by Ice Age glaciers. Many are rare. Isolated from similar species on other sky islands as effectively as if they were in the Galapagos, they represent especially potent raw material for evolutionary change. One such creature is the endangered Mount Graham red squirrel, the focus of a long-running political struggle over whether to destroy some of the squirrel's habitat to erect a complex of astronomical telescopes on the Pinalenos Mountains sky island.
This variety has turned the sky islands into "probably the richest area of this size in the United States" biologically speaking, said Dr. Wade C. Sherbrooke, the director of the American Museum of Natural History's Southwestern Research Station in the Chiricahua Mountains.
The United States section of the archipelago is home to about 265 species of birds, more than 75 reptile species, as many as 120 varieties of native grass, 20 percent of all known North American ant species, about the same proportion of bee species, 75 varieties of reptiles and 90 species of mammals, said Dr. Peter Warshall, an independent ecologist who has extensively studied the sky islands. About 175 species are considered imperiled.
The region is said to be the most diverse sector of the United States for ants, reptiles and mammals. Big wide-ranging predators like the Mexican wolf, grizzly bear and ocelot have long since been extirpated, but the region still teems with mountain lions, black bears, ring-tailed cats, bobcats, coatimundis, mule deer and a local subspecies of small white-tailed deer called the Coues' deer. And the occasional jaguar.
Biologically and climatically speaking, one can go from the desert almost to mountain tundra -- or from Mexico to northern Canada -- on a single drive of perhaps two hours along winding roads up a single sky island. The journey takes a visitor upward through distinct "stacks" of different ecological communities.
On just such a drive in the Chiricahuas, Dr. Warshall pointed out the stacks. From semidesert grassland, where tarantula spiders nearly the size of a man's palm scuttled by, the road ascended to the spectacularly beautiful Cave Creek Canyon, hemmed in by volcanic stone towers stained and weathered to shades of lemon, salmon, ocher and rust.
There, starting just above 5,000 feet, the mountainside was dominated by a dense mixture of evergreen oaks and pines, most of them characteristic of Mexico. Mexican birds like the painted redstart flitted through the branches in response to Dr. Warshall's call. Along the creek itself, birdwatchers from around the world come to spot a wide variety of species, including the trogon, a bird found mainly in Mexico that some believe to be the most elegant in North America.
Higher up, the trees changed gradually to towering ponderosa, a species of northern North American pine, then to a forest of Douglas fir, later to a mixed forest of Douglas and white fir, and finally to high-altitude Canadian or Alaskan spruce. Near the top, a foraging black bear and her two cubs claimed the visitors' attention by sending rocks clattering off the mountainside.
For more than a century, cattle have grazed both the grassland valleys of the region and mountainside pastures up to 9,000 feet. In the late 1800's, hundreds of thousands of cattle roaming the open range devastated the grasslands. Today, although things are better, most ranchers are finding it difficult to bring the land back from that low point, said Jora Young, a Nature Conservancy official who has studied the situation for a book she is writing. The Conservancy is a key player in the Malpai conservation experiment.
At the same time, natural fires have long been suppressed, allowing brush like mesquite to take over fire-resistant grasslands formerly swept clean by flames.
Still, the region's ecology is remarkably intact. "It's not pristine, but all the pieces are there, on the landscape, in the order they're supposed to be," said Ben Brown, a wildlife ecologist who is program director for the private Animas Foundation. The foundation owns the former Gray Ranch, which, with more than 300,000 acres, is the biggest chunk of the Malpai group's territory.
Now the challenge is to restore natural processes like fire and, above all, to fend off creeping subdivision -- today's chief threat in the eyes of the Malpai group. Already, development has eaten away at the Santa Catalina sky island outside Tucson and has begun to encroach on others farther out in the country. It is even nibbling at the seemingly remote Chiricahuas: "Crown Dancer Ranch Estates," reads a sign, advertising lots for sale, near the mouth of Cave Creek Canyon.
That is too close for comfort for the Malpai ranchers, whose territory includes the Peloncillo and Animas sky islands, the next two over from the Chiricahuas. As it happens, that is also a major concern of the Nature Conservancy and other environmental groups.
This common concern was long masked by a pattern of hostility and distrust among ranchers, conservationists and Federal land managers. The basic source of the conflict is that while cattlemen have assumed control of their ranches, the ranches themselves are cobbled together from both public and private land. Typically in the West, environmentalists have attacked both the ranchers and public agencies for misusing the land, while the ranchers have felt themselves losing control to outsiders.
The leaders of the Malpai group, including Warner Glenn, his wife, Wendy, and a neighbor, Bill McDonald, came to see this constant head-knocking as getting them nowhere. About six years ago, they began to think cooperation might be better. Early in the game, Mr. McDonald, a 44-year-old, fifth-generation rancher, said to John Cook, a Nature Conservancy vice president, that "if we don't join with the environmentalists, we're dead."
Public opinion has turned against the ranchers in the debate over public lands, Mr. McDonald explained the other day, adding that joining forces with their adversaries would enable the ranchers to "get off the defense." In the end, the Malpai ranchers hope, the resulting alliance will allow them to keep their ranches intact for the long term while improving the land, the cattle forage -- and the environment -- at the same time.
At the ranchers' invitation, Mr. Cook is co-executive director, along with Mr. McDonald, of the Malpai group.
In 1992, a wildfire on government-owned ranch land brought a confrontation of ranchers and government officials. The discussions led to a cooperative arrangement among the ranchers, the Forest Service and other government agencies to use fire as a land-management tool. Some 30 ranchers -- there were only four holdouts -- subsequently signed on voluntarily to an area-wide fire management plan.
That is a more significant achievement than it might seem at first glance, since the fire plan embodied the principle behind a nascent movement toward managing whole ecosystems and landscapes in a coordinated fashion, balancing the needs of nature with those of the economy. The fire plan bore an important result in June, when 6,000 acres of public and private land interwoven in checkerboard fashion were burned in the region's first prescribed fire after 80 years of deliberate fire suppression. A second prescribed burn involving 9,000 acres is being planned.
In another innovation, the Malpai group has set up a program called "grassbanking," in which a rancher whose grasses have been depleted by grazing and drought is allowed to graze his cattle on another ranch while his land recovers its health. In return, he signs a conservation easement, held by the nine-member Malpai board of directors, prohibiting subdivision of his land in perpetuity. So far four area ranchers have joined the program. Their cattle now graze on the former Gray Ranch.
Some ranchers are also working to restore the range by replanting native grasses and fencing in and restoring riparian areas.
Almost from the start, the Malpai ranchers took a step long anathema to many of their brethren: they invited biologists onto their land. Many ranchers have been "scared to death," in Wendy Glenn's words, that an inquisitive scientist would find an endangered species whose discovery would prevent them from using the land.
To Warner Glenn, people who refuse scientists are "dumber than a post, really, because there is some stuff we damned sure need to know" about the landscape if good decisions about its care and use are to be made. As it turns out, many ranchers have been "charmed" upon learning from scientists about the biological treasures on their land, says Ben Brown of the Animas Foundation.
So now, ecologists are establishing permanent monitoring plots all over the Malpai region to gauge the landscape's long-term health. One ranching family, that of Matt and Anna Magoffin, has taken under its wing the endangered Chiricahua leopard frog. Two critical populations of the frog have turned up in watering holes on their ranch, and the Magoffins and their two young sons kept one of the holes from going dry during a drought by hauling to it a thousand gallons of water a week. The Malpai group has since helped them install a pump.
Apart from the fire plan, several of the region's 35 ranchers are taking a wait-and-see attitude toward the Malpai group. But most are cooperating to some degree or other, says Mr. McDonald. Judy Keeler, one of the few outright dissenters, says, among other things, that she is leery of the Nature Conservancy, which has become a bete noir to many Westerners, that the fear about subdivisions is exaggerated, that any individual rancher can do what the Malpai group is doing, and that a lot of its activity is "just razzle-dazzle."
As Dr. Warshall points out, the Malpai experiment is "an embryo," and no one can tell how it will develop. At the very least, says Mr. McDonald, a new relationship has been created among former adversaries.
Beyond that, the primary importance of what is happening here may be in the realm of perception. "The main battle is a conceptual one -- it's understanding what's here" biologically, said Dr. Warshall. He was speaking of the Chiricahuas, but his statement might apply to the entire sky-island region. If so, the Malpai group may have turned an important corner.

In the stacked communities of Chiricahua Mountains, left, like the other 40 sky islands of the American Southwest and Mexico, the environments range from "Arizona" to "Alaska" in just a few miles.
 
Toward the peak, the forest shifts to spruces like Alaska's; a Mexican chickadee thrives.
 
From 7,000 to 8,000 feet, the ponderosa pine, a tree of the northern Rockies, predominates.
 
From 5,500 to 7,500 feet, a unique mix of both Mexican oaks and pines is the only U.S. home of the elegant trogon.
 
Below 4,500 feet are semi-desert grasslands and desert scrub, the "seas" that prevent most animals and plants from crossing between "islands." The rock rattlesnake lives here. From 4,500 to 6,000 feet, vegetation shifts gradually to a mixture of evergreen oaks and chaparral. (Source: Dr. Peter Warshall)(pg. C1)

ARCO looks to Russia to fill its vast appetite for oil reserves.

BYLINE: Agis Salpukas 

 BODY:
WITH its huge fields in decline in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, ARCO has been looking for new prospects overseas. Among the primary prospects for ARCO and other Western oil companies are Russia and some of the former Soviet republics like Kazakstan and Azerbaijan.
ARCO's approach has been different. Rather than form a consortium of Western companies to battle the Byzantine bureaucracies of the region, ARCO has teamed up with Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company. 
 That alliance was firmed up last week, with ARCO extending its commitment and providing more money for joint projects. ARCO and Lukoil Holding announced last week that ARCO would spend $5 billion over 18 years. That is $2 billion more, over a longer period, than the investment that ARCO and Lukoil had agreed to earlier this year. ARCO will have a 54 percent stake and Lukoil 46 percent in the joint venture, called Lukarco.
In the race to bring oil from Russia to market, the venture is not wasting time. "Work is already under way to indentify specific investments to start the operating phase of our work," said Mike R. Bowlin, the chairman and chief executive of ARCO, which is based in Los Angeles.
The company, which has a huge refining and marketing business for gasoline on the West Coast, cannot afford to wait too long.
It is under pressure to replace reserves and production because crude oil output is expected to fall about 6 percent a year from its Alaskan fields. The company's daily production of crude oil has fallen to 850,000 barrels a day from about 950,000 three years ago.
In recent decades the fortunes of the Atlantic Richfield Company have been closely tied to the oil flowing from Prudhoe Bay, which it discovered in partnership with Exxon in 1968.
With the building of the Alaskan pipeline in the 1970's the company thrived, feeding its growing refinery operations and gasoline stations on the West Coast.
But in the last several years production from those fields has declined at a faster rate than expected, and ARCO's efforts to find new fields there have been only modestly successful.
ARCO, which has traditionally been mostly a domestic producer, has cast its net wide pursuing overseas ventures in Algeria and Indonesia as well as in Russia, and recently announced a major deal to develop oil in Venezuela.
"We want to grow and the best prospects for growth are international," said Jay Cheatham, the president of ARCO international oil and gas.
While significant production in Russia is probably eight to 10 years away, there is great potential, he added, saying, "This is one place you have to be."
Having Lukoil as a partner, Mr. Cheatham said, will make it much simpler to put together projects to develop the vast oil and gas reserves in Russia and the Caspian Sea region.
"They know the Russian bureaucracy much better than us," he explained. Some of the other ventures by Western oil companies have often hit snags in seeking favorable terms in production agreements. They have also found it difficult to negotiate through a new structure emerging to oversee the Russian oil industry, in which many companies are in the process of learning to operate as private companies.
Paul Ting, an oil analyst for Salomon Brothers, said that since ARCO was hard pressed to find large new reserves "it makes sense to get a 350-pound blocker in front of you."
He said Lukoil carried clout among the agencies that oversee the Russian oil industry and could open up joint ventures faster than if ARCO joined with other Western companies in a consortium.
"Lukoil does have muscle," he added.
For Lukoil, ARCO brings a strong cash flow to finance projects and technical skill.
Vagit Alekperov, the president of Lukoil, said last week that the agreement "testifies to the growing confidence of Western investors in Russia's political stability and economic development."
ARCO stock, which has been rising since early this month reflecting the increasing prices for crude oil, fell 37.5 cents yesterday to close at $125.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: New York Needs Environment Bonds Now

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Assemblyman Michael J. Bragman's pay-as-you-go approach to New York State's pressing environmental problems ("The Trouble With Environment Bonds," Op-Ed, Sept. 14), a plan also endorsed by a Sept. 23 letter, would delay important projects for years, allowing conditions to worsen, risking public health and economic opportunity and placing an unacceptable burden on local taxpayers. 
 The Clean Water-Clean Air Bond Act is a fiscally prudent plan for addressing the state's most crucial environmental challenges -- restoring the Hudson River and Long Island Sound, for example, and closing leaky Adirondack landfills and cleaning up contaminated industrial sites and New York Harbor. The projects in the bond act, which include improvements to sewage treatment plants and drinking-water facilities, are long-term capital investments traditionally financed with bonds. Onondaga Lake in Syracuse is arguably the most polluted lake in the nation, suffering from more than 100 years of abuse. You can't clean up contamination like that in one year's budget.
We expect to commit about $900 million from the bond act for specific projects in the next five years, including $275 million this fiscal year. This would give local governments the assistance they need to address the environmental problems that threaten the vitality of their communities without having to resort to double-digit tax increases.
Because my administration is committed to bringing the level of state debt under control, New York's outstanding general-obligation debt is projected to decline 2 percent by 2000-2001, even if the bond act is approved. The cost to each New Yorker will be less than $4 annually, a reasonable investment in cleaner water and air.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Just Plain Folks, White House Style

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Did you catch the Barbara and Bob and Elizabeth and Bill and Hillary and Barbara shows? On "20/20" Friday, Barbara Walters chatted up the First Couple, a week after chatting up the would-be First Couple. "Open, intimate, off guard," promised Hugh Downs, Ms. Walters's right-hand man, of performances that had all the spontaneity of a convention biography: damp goods in a damp campaign season.
On the Dole hour, you could hear about Mr. Dole's war injury and recovery, a subject that he bravely kept pretty much to himself until the Presidential urge came upon him. We were taken back to Russell, Kan., in the company, to borrow Ms. Walters's unsparing cliche, of "this hometown boy who had made it big." Gee, there's the drugstore where he worked as a soda jerk; there's his 94-year-old teacher. There, in close-up, is the bad hand that he managed to keep off camera for years; lately it has been out front. 
 Mrs. Dole was brought on to sit thigh by thigh with her husband. No, the couple did not confess to Ms. Walters, wearing the deeply concerned expression etched in over the years, that they can't stand each other. It turned out that they like nothing better than being alone together with a good movie.
And there was Ms. Walters, doing what she does. "Has listening become important to you?" she inquired of the hometown boy. "When you listen around the country, what do you hear?" Turning tough, she asked whether politics had ruined his first marriage. As for the second marriage, Mrs. Dole revealed, "This is a very special relationship." She also admitted, under Ms. Walters's coaxing, "I have devotional time every day, 30 minutes."
Advertising that she would focus on "domestic issues which could deeply affect the American people," Ms. Walters apportioned about 5 of the almost 40 minutes to tax cuts, assault weapons, choosing judges and other subjects of moment. Mr. Dole seemed to be quoting from his commercials.
The most urgent issue, to judge by Ms. Walters's attention span, was whether the American Red Cross, not long since headed by Mrs. Dole, should accept contributions from tobacco companies. The Doles ducked, but agreed that the bottom line is that "kids should not smoke." Ms. Walters was unrelenting. "How important," she demanded of Mr. Dole, "is it for the President to be a role model?" He allowed as how it was real important.
Mr. Dole, to his credit, was somewhat restrained during what may have been an ordeal for a man of stoic mien with an ironic view of politics. The professionally bubblesome Mrs. Dole, who had proved her talent for this sort of stuff at the San Diego convention, helped him along when he faltered, hastening to assure Ms. Walters that his spirituality was more private than her spirituality.
The Clinton exercise was in a similar spirit, though not as spiritual. Toward the end, such matters as Iraq, welfare and drugs whizzed by, the President echoing the accentuate-the-positive lines that his surrogates have been spinning for weeks, although his smoky explanation of his famous non-inhaling sounded as though it had been concocted under the influence. (He allows, just as Mr. Dole does, that drugs are bad for you.) It was one of those encounters, not uncommon on television, in which the interviewer does her duty by reading off questions, never mind attending to the answers.
Ms. Walters's interest was elsewhere, in the neighborhood where the interests of "20/20" and of the candidates profitably converge: "I wonder what have the White House years meant to your marriage." Mrs. Clinton was admirably reticent, while her husband babbled away. (The main news was that Mrs. Clinton would work on welfare in a second Clinton Administration in some unofficial capacity.)
There were reflections on an alcoholic stepfather's effects on young Bill. (Those early conflicts at home have made the President try to get people to stop being self-destructive and "to do the right thing and bring them together and go forward.") There was Chelsea chat. (Her daddy will miss her a lot when she goes off to college next year.) And there was a life-in-the-White House tour. (You guessed it, the couple's happiest times are in the movie theater with two boxes of popcorn.)
Mr. Dole and Mrs. Clinton seemed at moments to withdraw from the shamelessness of the thing; they ought to make a date for the movies and leave the popcorn to their spouses.
The programs provided a showcase for the qualities that have elevated Ms. Walters to her high place on television: "If you were a reporter," she asked the President in earnest tones, "how far would you delve into someone's personal life?"
For the candidates, the shows were happy marriages of pop journalism and pop politics: 40 network minutes apiece with a benign priestess of prime time, who could probably get more votes than Mrs. Dole and Mrs. Clinton put together if she ran for something. Forty minutes of calculated family-values piety before an audience of millions. Mr. Downs, that loyal retainer, pronounced the results "very revealing profiles."
To despair over such displays, you have to believe that Presidential campaigns have other purposes than winning an election and that television news has other functions than winning the nightly ratings. You have to believe that both are opportunities for informing the nation instead of pandering to it. Rest easy. The alliance of news magazine programmers and political operatives is doing its best to save us from that heartless prospect.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Goats for Cashmere Promoted in Europe

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: RADDA IN CHIANTI, Italy, Sept. 18

 BODY:
Nora Kravis grabs a goat by the horn, ruffles the coarse hairs on its skin and points to the soft down underneath.
"Goats turn weeds into profits," said Ms. Kravis, a Long Island native who has lived in the soft hills of Italy's premier wine-growing region for the last 24 years. Her main activity now is breeding the kind of ornery goats that produce what looms spin into cashmere wool, a mainstay of Italy's fashion industry. 
 Her operation here, nestled between Florence and Siena, is tiny. On the Tuscan hills around her home, about 40 goats and kids romp. At the end of the season, the combings of each yield about 11 ounces, hardly enough to keep the huge European textile industry, which consumes about 60 percent of the world's annual cashmere production, running for very long.
But her farm is interesting because it is a little sign of Europe's textile makers fighting to protect the cashmere business. Europe raises virtually no goats for cashmere and for generations has purchased what it needs principally from China, whose Inner Mongolian goat herds are the world's chief source of the soft down. While it can be combed from any goat, breeds are favored whose yield is abundant and meet certain characteristics, including fineness and crimp.
As China has advanced economically, Ms. Kravis said that people in the business believed that China was doing with its cashmere "what the Arabs did with oil." Rather than sell the crude wool freely to the Europeans, who spin and weave it into sweaters that can cost as much as $1,000 and into costly scarves, coats and gloves, Beijing is increasingly putting pressure on European manufacturers, mainly in Italy and Scotland, to transfer their textile technology, and the added value it affords, to China.
"We are in the grip of the Chinese," says Carlo Piacenza, whose family runs Piacenza S.p.A., a leading cashmere maker, which is now spinning cashmere yarns there.
So three years ago, the European Union began the European Fine Fiber Network to promote the production of luxury fibers like cashmere in Europe. In the case of cashmere, government planners believe, the goats will not only supply wool but also create work in farming regions whose traditional crops are wiped out by agribusiness. At the same time, the stubble-eating goats will contribute to keeping untended farmland clean and presentable.
Now, Portuguese farmers are also experimenting with cashmere, and Finnish farmers with angora rabbits; a Swiss businessman, Josef Kuonen, imports alpaca to the country's Alpine pastures.
In the United States, a similar wave of cashmere mania swept the country in the late 1980's, as sheep farmers, weavers and textile designers realized that by using cashmere, apparel they produced could fetch far higher prices than those made with ordinary wool.
"The goats did sell in the initial rush for as much as $5,000," said Lydia Ratcliff, a breeder in Chester, Vt., and a member of the Eastern Cashmere Association. But in America, she said, cashmere stayed at the arts and crafts level, with few links, as in Europe, to industrial-scale producers. Ms. Ratcliff's goats now fetch $200 to $400 a head.
But the path of a cashmere breeder, at least in Italy, is steep, and Ms. Kravis's project is stalled. Bureaucratic hurdles caused her to miss a deadline for European Union subsidies, so money is lacking for a 2,500-square-foot barn she needs for embryo transplants. Strict building codes in the Chianti region of Tuscany require the barn be built of stone, with a tile roof, raising the cost to almost $200,000, from the $65,000 it might cost elsewhere. And Ms. Kravis not suffering alone.
Colin Plumbe, the managing director of Todd & Duncan, a major dyer and spinner of cashmere in Kinross, Scotland, agrees that doing business with the Chinese is risky. "Nobody likes to be tied to a single source," he said. Yet, he added, though the industry "has been interested for decades" in developing home-grown alternatives to suppliers like China, "now it's probably true to say it has lost interest."
Ideally, cashmere-bearing goats thrive in extremely cold climates, which promote growth of the soft down that is their protection, and in dry climates, which keep out oil in the down. Experiments of the last 20 to 30 years, he explained, had yielded goats suitable to European climates, but bearing unsuitable cashmere, or goats with good-quality cashmere that could not stand the climate.
The big producers, in the meantime, are investing in China. Besides Piacenza's spinning operations there, is Loro Piana S.p.A., a major Italian weaver, which last year formed a joint venture in Outer Mongolia, another cashmere region.
Though breeders like Ms. Kravis lack seed money to get started, the industry offers limited support. In recent years, Piacenza provided looms and other machinery to test what Italian breeders produced.
"Perhaps it did not reach the quality of the Chinese," Mr. Piacenza said, but he added that it surpassed fibers from Iran, a secondary supplier. Yet now, he adds, the experiments should end. "It's time to move to the political side, to create incentives for breeding," he said, like tax breaks or grants to farmers.
Piacenza's looms, after all, require 200 tons of cashmere every year, he said, adding, "Of course, we're talking about hundreds of thousands of goats.".

HEADLINE: Dow Up 6.28, to 5,894.74, in Sluggish Trading

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average rallied from a 53-point deficit to finish at a record yesterday, but declines in oil and semiconductor shares hurt the broader market.
The Dow average rose 6.28, to 5,894.74, surpassing its previous high of 5,889.20 set one week ago. 
 Trading was sluggish -- only 300.3 million shares changed hands on the Big Board, making it the sixth-slowest day this year. The Yom Kippur observance kept some people away from their desks, and investors were reluctant to take positions one day before the Federal Reserve meets to discuss interest rate policy.
"The market has adjusted to the possibility of a rate increase," said Garrett Nagle, president of Garrett Nagle & Company, with $200 million in assets. "The market will quickly shift its focus from rates to earnings, and the third quarter looks acceptable." Falling bond yields benefited bank shares, and helped stocks rebound from their lows. Allied Signal Inc. led the Dow average's rebound, rising 1 1/4, to 64.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index, representing about 75 percent of the value of all United States stocks, fell 0.55, to 686.48. The Nasdaq Composite Index slid 8.22, to 1,211.47, recovering only part of its earlier 12.01-point drop. The Amex Market Value Index dropped 1.58, to 563.62.
Some 1,456 shares dropped and 869 rose on the Big Board, the biggest disparity of decliners to advancers since Sept. 5.
Oil shares fell after the United States said it might move one of its aircraft carriers from the Persian Gulf, easing fears that a broader conflict would drive up crude oil prices by threatening gulf supplies.
"It seems the crisis has passed," said Mark Donovan, a fund manager at Boston Partners, with $6.5 billion under management.
Crude oil for November delivery rose 15 cents a barrel, to $23.22, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after dropping. Exxon fell 1/4, to 86 5/8; Texaco dropped 1/4, to 95, and Mobil Corporation dropped 1 3/8, to 118 1/4.
Stocks rebounded from their lows, led by shares of big banks such as Citicorp, which rose 1 1/4, to 89 3/8, and the Chase Manhattan Corporation, which climbed 1 1/4, to 79 1/4. Even if the Fed raises rates by 25 basis points, bank profits will not suffer, investors said.
"In an uncertain environment for profits, these big banks have a pretty certain earnings outlook," Mr. Donovan said.
But semiconductor stocks fell after a rally last week that sent the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 8.9 percent.
Texas Instruments Inc. fell 1 3/8, to 51 3/4; Intel slid 1 5/8, to 95 3/4; Cyrix Corporation slid 11/16, to 13, and Motorola Inc. dropped5/8, to 51 1/8. Bucking the trend, the Compaq Computer Corporation's stock rose 1, to 64 3/4, after Jon van Bronkhorst, an analyst at Robertson Stephens & Company, said the personal computer maker's stock was undervalued.
Interneuron Pharmaceutical Inc. fell 1 1/8, to 24 1/2. A United States Food and Drug Administration panel will hold an unusual public debate about how to structure and monitor clinical trials of Interneuron Pharmaceutical Inc.'s hot-selling anti-obesity drug Redux. If the Federal Reserve is looking for a reason to raise interest rates, it need look no further than Government reports issued last week showing robust new home construction and rising output at the nation's factories. While those developments bode well for companies generally, the prospect of rising rates to moderate the growth does not.
"Strong economic news may be bad news for economically sensitive stocks if it means the Fed has to be more aggressive in slowing the economy," said Peter Keane, chief investment officer at Sovereign Advisers in Charlotte, N.C., which manages $300 million.

Bond Prices Are Higher On Thin Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday in lackluster trading as traders prepared for today's meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 8/32, to 96 5/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 7.02 percent, from 7.04 percent on Friday. 
 Trading volume was light in the morning as Yom Kippur thinned the ranks of traders and added to the sluggishness of the session. Maureen Mooney, a market analyst with Govpx, a bond pricing service, said the volume in the morning was about 40 percent below an average Monday, comparable to a day this past winter when severe weather kept many traders at home.
Bonds were trading slightly lower until the afternoon, when the Reuters news service reported that an unidentified source had said that Fed officials were using the core rate of inflation, which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy, to guide them in making policy.
The core rate has not shown signs of picking up. Excluding food and energy, consumer prices are up about 2.6 percent over 12 months through August, compared with 3 percent last year, analysts said.
The Reuters report suggested that Fed policy makers would have less of a reason to raise rates today, and bonds rallied, forcing speculators who had bet on a decline to cover their short positions by buying securities.
Still, the market remained deeply divided over what course the Fed would take today. Analysts note that since the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting in August, at which the Fed left rates unchanged, there has been evidence to support both a rate increase and no increase.
The uncertainty in the market has increased since Reuters reported last week that eight of the 12 regional Federal Reserve presidents favored a rate increase.
Many in the market, including Gerald A. Guild, senior vice president of the taxable fixed-income department at Advest Inc., expect that Fed policy makers will raise short-term rates by 25 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
Still, Mr. Guild said: 'It's time the F.O.M.C announced their resolve to control inflation. My heart tells me there should be a 50-basis-point hike on the Federal funds rate and a 25-basis-point increase in the the discount rate, but the chances of that happening are about nil. My reason is that if they did this the Fed would take the lead in setting monetary policy rather reacting to market forces."
At the Treasury's regular weekly bill auction yesterday, there was decent bidding for both maturities, as rates rose. The three-month bill was awarded an average discount rate of 5.18 percent, up from 5.07 percent last week, and the six-month bill awarded a rate of 5.30 percent, up from 5.19 percent.
Tomorrow the Treasury is selling $18.25 billion of two-year notes and Thursday $12.5 billion of five-year notes. In when-issued trading the two-year notes were being offered at a price to yield 6.24 percent and the five-year notes 6.59 percent.
Following are the results of the Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: POLITICS: FOREIGN POLICY;
A Once-Crucial Issue Languishes in the Campaign

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
The mini-crisis in United States relations with Iraq in the last few weeks has only emphasized how meager a role foreign policy has played during this long campaign year, especially when compared with past Presidential contests.
For decades, the cold war and how to win it colored domestic politics. And there were always specific flash points: Korea, Cuba, Quemoy and Matsu, Berlin, Nicaragua, the Middle East, the Persian Gulf and, of course, Southeast Asia. Dwight D. Eisenhower's wartime exploits reassured Americans made nervous by the Nuclear Age, Barry Goldwater lost because voters considered him too trigger-happy for the Presidency, Lyndon B. Johnson was driven from office by failure in Vietnam, and Ronald Reagan rode to a second term on a tide of anti-Soviet rhetoric. 
 The rule was, foreign affairs could not win you the Presidency but it could cost you the Presidency. George Bush encouraged the reunification of Germany, helping to calm what might have been a chaotic period in Central Europe, and he assembled the coalition that expelled Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. But because he neglected the economy at home, his exploits abroad availed him little.
On the other hand, Jimmy Carter looked inept in dealing with the Iran hostage crisis, and he, like Johnson, was brought down by the widespread feeling that he was incapable of defending the interests of the United States.
Despite some rough spots during the last four years -- Somalia and Haiti, for example -- and despite the contention of scholars and diplomats that the Clinton Administration, depending too much upon improvisation, has failed to develop a coherent foreign policy, Bill Clinton has escaped any significant political damage from crises overseas.
Indeed, in the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, completed earlier this month, the President's approval ratings for foreign policy reached 53 percent, the highest of his Administration. Almost the same number of people, 52 percent, said they felt confident of his ability to handle an international crisis.
Unchallenged in the primaries, he watched as potential Republican rivals fought it out almost entirely on the basis of domestic policy. Patrick J. Buchanan accused him of selling out to the Japanese and the Mexicans on trade and of ceding too much authority to the United Nations but was unable to convince more than a small minority of Republicans. Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana had even less luck with a campaign built partly on the dangers of nuclear proliferation.
There have been only the faintest echoes of these issues in the general election so far. Ross Perot still criticizes United States trade policy, and he chose as a running mate a man who made his reputation doing so, Pat Choate. In his speech accepting the Republican nomination, Bob Dole had some harsh things to say about the United Nations and its Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
But taxes and crime and other domestic policy questions have remained at the heart of the campaign. Once American forces were committed to action in Iraq, Mr. Dole pulled back from criticism of the President's dealing with Mr. Hussein.
The Helms-Burton Act, which would penalize countries that profit from properties confiscated by the Cuban government, has stirred heated political discussion in Canada, Mexico and Western Europe, but no one bothers to mention it in the American political campaign.
At least some of Mr. Dole's advisers think he could profit from discussing foreign policy. It is an area where his experience considerably exceeds Mr. Clinton's, and where Mr. Clinton's record has been spotty, if far better late in his term than earlier. One who believes that is Robert Ellsworth, the former Representative from Kansas, who cut his political teeth under Richard M. Nixon, a President who always argued that foreign policy lay at the very center of politics.
But Republican strategists and pollsters, like their Democratic counterparts, insist that the voting public does not care about foreign affairs.
Does this all-but-exclusive preoccupation with matters close to home make any difference? Even among those whose work centers on foreign policy, there is nothing approaching consensus.
Morton I. Abramowitz, president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, is one of those who is not perturbed in the slightest. "No foreign policy in the campaign?" he asked earlier this year. "Good. Keep politics out of it, and the experts can do a more constructive job."
Allan E. Gotlieb, a former Canadian Ambassador to the United States, sees peril in the gradual "marginalization," as he calls it, of foreign affairs.
"If you have no discussion in campaigns, and relatively little in Congress," Mr. Gotlieb said this week, "you establish no context for policy. So when trouble comes, it is harder for a President to build support for his policies in the electorate, and it is harder for your allies to understand what is happening."
Relatively calm though the world may seem at the moment, there is certainly ample potential for disruption, either during the final stages of the campaign or in the next four years. The odds are strong, for example, that by the beginning of the next millennium there will be new leaders in Russia, China, India and Saudi Arabia. Each change will pose fresh questions for the United States (What to do if the transition in Hong Kong goes badly?) but there is no disposition to chew them over in advance this fall.
Politicians naturally shy from formulating positions on issues that no one is pressing. They have enough problems carrying voters with them on the issues they cannot avoid.
But it seems unlikely that the next President, whoever he is, will be able to avoid hard decisions on such questions as the future of the Middle East peace process, the timing of expansion of the NATO alliance to the east and the succession to Boris N. Yeltsin in Russia in light of the rise of the aggressive former general, Aleksandr I. Lebed.
Only in national elections does the American public have much influence over the course of American foreign policy. As things now stand, voters will forfeit their limited leverage this time because they will hear little to enable them to choose between varying approaches to the problems that surely lie ahead.

HEADLINE: Once Bitter Enemies, Now Business Partners;
South African Blacks Buy Into Industry

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Sept. 23

 BODY:
It wasn't the usual handshake on a deal. One hand, white, belonged to Nicholas Oppenheimer, scion of the family that controls much of South Africa's gold- and diamond-mining. The other, black, belonged to Cyril Ramaphosa, a prominent foe of the old, white-ruled South Africa and leader of a crippling 1987 miners strike.
The $900 million deal that the two men signed last month sells a large piece of the Anglo American Corporation, the Oppenheimer flagship that by some estimates accounts for 25 percent of South Africa's gross domestic product, to a consortium of blacks led by Mr. Ramaphosa. 
 Both sides got a bargain. Blacks bought a big share of the nation's best-known company at 11 percent below market price. Anglo hopes it bought a shield against the potential hostility of a new black Government for the decades it supported apartheid and profited from a cruel system using migrant labor.
As Anglo American joins a growing number of white-dominated corporations courting black investors, both sides are also helping to assure the political future of the country by bringing blacks into the mainstream economy; many here agree that if majority rule does not lead to a growing black middle class, and if black citizens do not feel that they live in a land of opportunity, the nation's survival is at risk.
For that reason, black economic empowerment may be the most important trend in South African business today. The Anglo American deal, the largest yet, brought together investors ranging from black-owned holding companies to union pension funds, a small-business group and the National African Chamber of Commerce.
The Anglo American deal is so big that blacks now have control or major influence -- meaning the power to appoint board members -- over companies representing almost 10 percent of the capitalization on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. They include holding companies, medium-size manufacturers, cellular phone companies, publishers and insurers.
"It's astonishing how quickly black business is getting in," said Robin McGregor, an analyst who tracks the murky world of corporate ownership here. "I keep a file of clippings on it, and I'm reaching for my scissors every day now."
In many cases, these deals create instant millionaires. In some, the investor groups are now operating the businesses. In others, the profits have financed black investors' entry into other industries, without conferring management control.
Empowerment reflects the new truth that this is a black African nation and that the privileged whites running its economy have become a nervous minority. In the United States, such efforts are largely limited to affirmative-action hiring, loans to small business and public contracts set aside for minority businesses. Here, affirmative action and set-asides exist, but huge conglomerates also search the country for black investors, to sell them valuable assets at discount prices. In some cases, they lend the purchase money.
"There's no guilt complex in America," declared Themba Sono, a professor of business economics at the University of the Witwatersrand here. But many of the biggest companies, he continued, "can't refuse. They'd be branded racist."
Black empowerment, South African style, has critics. Some say that in a nation where black unemployment is about 40 percent and laborers may earn $12 a day, the deals mainly enrich well-connected businessmen. Others call the deals cynical efforts by big business to buy the friendship of those in power.
Those tensions are evident in the group buying into Anglo American, the National Empowerment Consortium -- in which the miners, rail, textile and food-service unions, wary of the holding companies, insisted that no member could buy more than one-eighth of the total.
Anglo announced two years ago that a major subsidiary, the Johnnies Industrial Corporation, often known as Johnnic, was for sale -- if the right group of blacks could be found. Other buyers made inquiries.
"We told them they were wasting their time," an Anglo American spokesman, Michael W. Spicer, said. It waited for a black group to assemble. This spring, Mr. Ramaphosa became the group's negotiator when he retired as executive secretary of the African National Congress.
Reserving an offer for black buyers, and selling at prices lower than others pay, would presumably be illegal under American law. "If we were doing this sale in the States, we would be liable for a shareholder suit," Mr. Spicer conceded. "But for obvious historical reasons, South Africa is not Manhattan."
Anglo offered the consortium its 48 percent stake in Johnnic, a holding company worth 8.5 billion rand -- $1.88 billion at current exchange rates -- that owns big stakes in other large companies including South African Breweries, Premier Milling, Omni Media, and Toyota South Africa. Three insurance companies also have stakes in Johnnic.
When the deal was announced, Johnnic was trading at 56 rand a share. The consortium has until July 1 to buy a 20 percent stake in the company for 50 rand a share. Then it has 18 months to buy 15 percent more at 5 percent below the average market price.
Small businesses and investors can also buy in at the 50 rand price -- and if they need cash, Anglo will lend them 90 percent at low interest, keeping the shares as security and repaying the loans from dividends and capital appreciation.
"The indications are now that we will find the money," Mr. Ramaphosa said, borrowing from South African banks, insurers and union pension funds.
The consortium will appoint half of Johnnic's board. In return, insiders said, it agrees not to fundamentally change the company or sell its shares for three years, so management effectively remains as is. Johnnic is a holding company, so the deal will not affect the daily management of the companies it invests in.
The next target is another Anglo American subsidiary, JCI Ltd., that owns gold, coal and chrome mines. Mr. Ramaphosa -- who once joked on a visit to JCI that "the next time I drop in, it will be as chairman" -- seems confident of success.
The biggest empowerment deal before Anglo American's was in 1994, when Sanlam, the Afrikaner-dominated South African National Life Assurance Company, sold its $220 million subsidiary for black policyholders to a group led by Dr. Ntatho Motlana, a longtime Soweto community leader. "We do not want guilt offerings or handouts," Dr. Motlana, who has founded a chain of clinics, said then. "At the same time, our goal is not a gradual, bottom-up approach to advancement."
Sanlam accepted, as payment, low-dividend preferred stock in a holding company formed by Dr. Motlana, New Africa Investments Ltd. It now has interests in a cellular phone network, a bank, a television movie channel and The Sowetan newspaper. It also co-founded an investment house, DLJ Pleiade.
"Now they're so big, they have no problem getting bank loans," said Sven Lunsche, business editor of The Sunday Times of Johannesburg. "They don't need to seek out white partners any more."
The founders of black-empowerment vehicles are often coy about the source of their seed money. It is widely reported, for example, that one group, Thebe Investments, began with $2 million given to the African National Congress in exile by Scandinavian countries, Japan and others who wanted to help the liberation struggle but not buy guns.
On a smaller scale, Magnus Heystek, an investment adviser, says he helps medium-size manufacturers sell stakes to black investor groups. Buyers, he said, range from middle-class professional women to the owners of formerly illegal bars and shops in black townships.
New Africa Investments, however, has been criticized by Sam Shilowa, secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, as a "front for white investors" that "steals public resources and puts them in the hands of a few black individuals."
Dr. Motlana, in response, pointed out that he had created a foundation to help small entrepreneurs and added that no one criticized white magnates for getting rich.
His business partner, Dikgane Moseneke, said that New Africa Investments has 19,000 shareholders, "who've put in anything from a hundred bucks to a couple of thousand," and that 14 percent of the company is held by black unions' pension funds.
Some critics see another side to the movement, contending that corporations are co-opting people close to the Government to make sure no anti-business legislation is passed. The A.N.C. has stopped talking about nationalizing the economy, but South Africa businesses benefit from practices including price-fixing cartels and secret corporate ownership that are illegal in other countries.
Such tactics were used by the National Party, when it came to power in 1948. Its conservative Afrikaner constituency detested the English-speaking whites who ran business. With the Government threatening to nationalize the mines, businessmen invited well-connected Afrikaners onto their boards. In 1963, Harry Oppenheimer, Nicholas's father, engineered the sale of the General Mining Corporation, which had gold interests, to a small coal-mining company run by Afrikaners. The result, Gencor, is now one of the country's most powerful mining houses.
"After that, the only trouble for the English mining houses was from the black miners," Dr. Motlana said, laughing. Business and government developed a cordial, if strained, relationship; business leaders defended apartheid and boasted of South Africa's cheap migrant labor.
Twenty years later, when Anglo American came to the forefront in opening relations with the African National Congress, more than conscience was involved again: international sanctions were beginning to hurt. Mr. Ramaphosa said Anglo American had been motivated by "both guilt and fear." The company's spokesman, Mr. Spicer, was circumspect.
The decision to sell Johnnic was "not pure altruism," he said, "but we think it's enlightened self-interest."
A former Anglo executive who heard some of the discussions two years ago that led to the Johnnic deal was blunter, saying co-opting the new Government had been the goal. The executive said the deal was discussed in crude racial terms, with talk of throwing the blacks "a bone."
Asked about that, Mr. Moseneke of New Africa Investments sighed and said:
"When we started talking with Anglo, their level of arrogance was just frightening. They came to appreciate us as people with skills -- perhaps greater than their own. And to understand that but for apartheid, they wouldn't have the money they do."

HEADLINE: Mayor Who Loves to Hate His City;
Utica's Leader Relishes His 'Lousy' Job in a 'Lousy' Place

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

DATELINE: UTICA, N.Y.

 BODY:
One of the inexplicable things Edward A. Hanna did when he was Mayor here 20 years ago was to declare that Utica was "a lousy place to live." Another was to construct the Tower of Hope outside City Hall in honor of Bob Hope, who has no particular connection to Utica.
So it has not surprised people here that now, back in office after a hiatus longer than many careers, Mayor Hanna seems to be relishing the fact that Utica is in a financial crisis. 
 The crisis has given him, at age 74, the chance to again provoke people with unorthodox ideas, like proposing to close the city government entirely. And the crisis is helping Mr. Hanna prove his main point, which seems to be that Utica has needed his quirky leadership since he lost a bid for re-election in 1977.
"Everything I've touched since the day I took office has been corrupt, stupid and wrong," he yelled in his office one morning in September. "I've yet to find anything I can say, 'Somebody did something right.' "
The city avoided default in August only because the state stepped in to buy its notes; also in the summer Utica received the lowest bond rating of any city in the country from Standard & Poor's: CCC. "We got just what we deserved," Mr. Hanna said.
Some here said Mr. Hanna's return to the Mayor's office in January was a sign of just how desperate Utica, like many older cities across the state and nation in recent years, is for solutions to intractable financial problems.
But even they said their Mayor's yelling, bickering and obsession with detail are just what Utica needs to force itself to confront the financial facts.
"We've got a Mayor who whatever his faults and flaws, is unwilling to sweep under the rug the problems Utica faces," said John H. Johnsen, a professor at Utica College who is chairman of a citizens' committee that urges regional financing for services in Utica and its suburbs.
There are, however, people here who say the Mayor's faults and flaws are worthy of note. For example, it struck some people as unusual that Mr. Hanna, a Democrat who has sometimes run as an Independent, made it a top priority to rebuild Hanna Park outside City Hall with Federal and state funds while the city teetered near bankruptcy and while he was cutting police and fire services.
Hanna Park, built during the first Hanna administration from 1974 to 1977 and named for him later, is near Hanna Park Drive, also named for him, and not far from Ellen Hanna Minipark. The Mayor built the minipark with his own money in honor of his wife of 49 years, known to residents here from the Mayor's greeting during his folksy long-running weekly radio show: "Ellen, were you at bridge game today or casino?"
Some critics thought it odd, too, how, in the midst of municipal chaos, Mr. Hanna had time to worry about getting the carillon in the Tower of Hope to play again after years of silence. Once again, as it did in the 1970's, the Tower of Hope is bonging out the Mayor's favorite song on the half hour, "I Did It My Way," made famous by Frank Sinatra.
"These are the crazy, nutty things Ed Hanna is noted for," said Michael Cerminaro, the president of Utica's Common Council and a Republican who is mentioned as a potential mayoral candidate in four years.
But it is also true that Mr. Hanna loves the details of governing and thrives on exposing other people's misdeeds. A millionaire entrepreneur who made his fortune by perfecting a photo developer that went into use around the world, Mr. Hanna returned to public office two years ago as city comptroller, after an absence of nearly two decades. He acknowledges spending more than $250,000 of his own money in his effort to revive his political career in the last few years. The Mayor's salary is $60,000.
As comptroller, Mr. Hanna warned that years of mismanagement, a declining tax base and a shrinking population had broken the city's finances. He also revealed less momentous developments. In a report to the public, he detailed how a staff member had used a city fax machine for an urgent personal matter. He forced the employee to pay $2. "I, as always, am on top of every expenditure of taxpayers' money," Mr. Hanna wrote.
After winning a close three-way race for Mayor last fall in which a Republican incumbent and a Republican Councilwoman split the anti-Hanna vote, Mr. Hanna turned his prodigious energy to the task at hand. He cut city jobs, although because of ongoing fights over cutback plans, exact numbers are hard to come by. He has also closed one of six firehouses and partly shut another and proposed a budget that would have eliminated city funds for the library and zoo.
Many of his plans were rejected by the Common Council. But his frustration with local politics has not slowed him down.
He has been pressing ahead on various fronts. He speaks often about his main proposal to solve Utica's problems. "City government should be closed down," he said.
There are many supporters in this area for a regional approach that would rescue the city by having governments throughout the Utica area share the cost of services. Mr. Hanna has become a champion of that idea and appointed one of his opponents in the mayoral campaign to serve as a regionalization coordinator. But when asked about the Mayor's suggestion that the city government could be closed soon, several leaders of the regionalization efforts said that seemed implausible.
Mr. Hanna remains undeterred. He said he hoped the city would go out of business before the end of his term so he would not have to complete it.
"It's a lousy job," he said. "You inherit all these problems. You inherit a bankrupt city. Am I going to say it's a beautiful job?"
Mr. Hanna, a 5-foot-7-inch man with a craggy face and a booming voice, has always insisted that his motives are altruistic. And there are many here who agree. "He's blunt, he's not very tactful, he's not a very good salesman and yet he's right about a lot of things," said Robert Fowler, president of the Utica Area Chamber of Commerce.
Many in the business community have been enthusiastic about the Mayor, who has aggressively pursued new business for Utica, which has continued to lose residents, with the population declining to 64,000, from 68,000 in 1990.
Mr. Hanna said that after he was turned out of office in 1977, he returned to running his business and lived in Florida and Paris. But when he sold his own company six years ago and moved back to Utica, he said, he wanted to get involved in business again. And he said he viewed governing this city as a business where he can help people.
Some who have watched Mr. Hanna for years say public spiritedness is not the total explanation for his involvement in politics. "He loves to be the center of attention," said John O. Lindell, a political science professor at Hartwick College in Oneonta who was Mr. Hanna's aide during a single term as an assemblyman 30 years ago and has watched his career since.
Mr. Hanna's interest in the spotlight was evident one September morning. After ushering a reporter with a 9 A.M. appointment to a seat at the side of the Mayor's desk, Mr. Hanna proceeded to "run city government" for nearly three hours before he said he had time to be interviewed.
He summoned more than 30 city employees and cross-examined them about matters large and small. In what seemed to be a very loud version of a stage whisper, he railed about this "stupid law," that "overloaded payroll" and the immorality of political contributions, which he said he has never accepted.
A subject he often returned to was the terrible shape the city was in when he returned as Mayor and the good job he was doing. "That's another big mistake they made," he said as he told two befuddled-looking workers about how he corrected mismanagement and waste.
At one point, eight worried-looking aides surrounded his desk while six city employees waited in chairs. By the time some employees arrived, Mr. Hanna appeared to have forgotten why he had shouted out for his secretary to get them. Some employees were the objects of tantrums. "Don't come in and treat me like a damn fool," Mr. Hanna screamed, his eyes watering in rage, at one city engineer.
Some of the city workers seemed uncertain what the purpose of the audience was. One young man wearing a T-shirt and a Giants cap turned out to be the person responsible for removing discarded trees.
It soon became clear that Mr. Hanna wanted to remind the young man of the Hanna policy that discarded logs should be made available to the citizenry. "You're saving the pieces people can use in their fireplaces, Joe?"
"Yes," Joe said.
"Good," the Mayor said.
When Mr. Hanna did finally have time to be interviewed, he was asked about the fact that he seemed to be enjoying himself.
"It's a lousy job," he said. "That doesn't mean I don't like it."

HEADLINE: Greek Premier Begins Shuffle Of Cabinet

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: ATHENS, Sept. 23

 BODY:
Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who won strong support from voters in parliamentary elections over the weekend, moved today to assemble a new ministerial team to push through changes in foreign and economic policy.
Mr. Simitis, who succeeded Andreas Papandreou in January and called for the early elections in the hope of gaining a mandate for his reforms, has vowed to turn Greece's sprawling and inefficient bureaucracy into a "hands-on" meritocracy. 
 Officials now say he is almost certain to replace Defense Minister Gerassimos Arsenis, who has pushed for a $10 billion military buildup. And his Foreign Minister, Theodoros Pangalos, was also considered likely to leave, but perhaps for another ministry, like transportion.
Since taking office, Mr. Simitis has worked hard to convince the United States and the European Union that a new era in relations was at hand. And Western diplomats seemed pleased that Mr. Simitis had come through elections on Sunday with 162 deputies in the 300-seat Parliament, saying it meant stability.
European Union diplomats expected Mr. Simitis to be more active in pushing for economic reforms, and have applauded him for a style that is less confrontational than his predecessor's.
Mr. Simitis joined the Socialist party in 1974 when it was set up after a brutal seven-year military junta fell. He has served in every Papandreou Cabinet but remained largely in the shadows until his one-time mentor fell ill last year.
Then Mr. Simitis, 60, replaced the ailing Mr. Papandreou as Prime Minister in January, scored a leadership victory to run the party after Mr. Papandreou died in June, and finally cemented his grip on power on Sunday by leading the Socialists to a solid election victory.
"With such a strong victory, all leadership battles are finished in our party," a former senior Socialist party official said.
Mr. Simitis is an intensely private man who seemed ill-at-ease with the public attention of campaigning. He has turned his back on the histrionics and unpredictable shifts of Mr. Papandreou. Instead, Mr. Simitis, who trained in Germany and Britain as an economist and lawyer, has called for a "new era" of sacrifice and work to earn the respect of European Union partners.

HEADLINE: For Kuwaitis, Self-Reliance Proves to Be an Elusive Goal

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: KUWAIT, Sept. 23

 BODY:
Exultant but also bitter after the Persian Gulf war, Kuwait sought to settle scores, deporting tens of thousands of foreign workers whose leaders had backed Iraq in the conflict. The new Kuwait, its leaders declared, should be run by the Kuwaitis.
But today Egyptians, Pakistanis, Filipinos and others have filled the void that the foreign workers, mainly Palestinians, left behind, and Kuwaitis are as much a minority in their own land as ever before. 
 And as the United States vows anew to defend this country, with a total population of two million and vast oil reserves, many Kuwaitis now say they feel no qualms about relying on others.
"The Kuwaiti, he does not like to work," Falah al-Rashidi, a 23-year-old Kuwaiti assigned to the National Guard. "The foreigners have experience that we lack, and they work for lower salaries. This does not mean that the Kuwaiti does not contribute. But this way, the Kuwaiti can stay safe and rested."
More than six years after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, nearly every sign of the seven-month occupation that followed has been erased.
Luxury American cars hum along modern highways. Futuristic architecture adorns the downtown skyline. And voters like Mr. Rashidi are flocking to nightly political gatherings as they prepare to elect a new Parliament, a ritual still unknown to Kuwait's Persian Gulf neighbors.
Despite the promise let loose by liberation, Kuwait -- whose own citizens pay no taxes, account for just one-sixth of the work force and are guaranteed high-paying jobs in Government ministries -- has yet to set a clear course for the future.
And the most visible indicator -- a demand by Parliament last month that young men and women be segregated at the Government-financed Kuwait University within the next five years -- is regarded by liberals and intellectuals as particularly troubling. On a campus where clingy T-shirts have become almost as common on young women as more modest Islamic dress, it is regarded as a move away from the postwar spirit that has left Kuwait relatively tolerant of Western ways.
"Culturally, it is a step backward," said Moudi Bou-Resli, a professor of zoology at the university, who herself attended mixed classes at the university soon after it was founded in 1967.
Parliament, disbanded in 1986 and restored in 1992 only under American pressure, has proven aggressive in investigating allegations of corruption in the Government, which answers to the Emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah. His family has wielded supreme power in Kuwait for 200 years.
The Emir and his family retain the final decision on most matters, however, and Parliament has veered away from central issues, including democracy, the economy and national defense.
"All their ideas are still in the drawers," said Abdullah al-Rashidi, a 46-year-old Kuwaiti who sported a thick gold and platinum bracelet under his cream-colored full-length gown and holds a sinecure in a ministry he would not identify. "Maybe they're afraid that if they decide anything, they won't have anything new to talk about."
This reluctance has troubled not only voters and political rivals, who have filled newspaper columns with denunciations of a do-nothing legislators, but also many outsiders, who assert that Kuwait has done too little to address human and economic inequities.
"Significant problems remain," the State Department said in its most recent human rights report on Kuwait, which pointed out that women still do not have the right to vote and that the Government continues to be hostile to more than 100,000 stateless people known as the "bidoon."
Under Kuwait's restrictive electoral laws, only 107,000 among the country's 720,000 citizens -- all of them men able to prove Kuwaiti ancestry back at least one generation -- will be eligible to vote on Oct. 7.
In 1992, most of the members of what was then the new Parliament said they favored extending the vote to women. But that movement has languished, complicated by debates over whether women should also be permitted to hold office and by the fears of some political moderates that Kuwaiti women might emerge as a particularly conservative political force.
Kuwait has also managed to reduce the number of bidoon (the word means "without") to about 117,000 from a prewar level of 220,000. Most are of Iranian or Iraqi origin, and some have lived in Kuwait for generations. But it has shown no hint of granting citizenship except to a tiny minority, and it has purged the Kuwaiti military of nearly all the bidoon within its ranks.
But the Government continues to shower benefits on its own citizens, who benefit from cradle-to-grave medical care, free education and subsidies on electricity and water so generous that both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have registered complaints.
Every Kuwaiti is also assured of a job, and of those who work, 93 percent are Government employees, earning wages far higher than those in the private sector. By law, Kuwaitis receive a minimum wage more than double that paid to foreigners, and their workday ends by 2 P.M., creating an early-afternoon rush hour as parents hurry to collect their children from school.
"A lot of people still think that all of this is their due -- that it's their share of the oil revenue," a Western diplomat said.
For now, with Kuwait pumping two million barrels of oil a day -- its prewar level -- and oil prices higher than predicted, such generosity may be sustainable. Having dipped deeply into its cash reserves, cutting them from $100 billion to $35 billion, and borrowed another $5.5 billion to cover the costs of the gulf war and reconstruction, Kuwait has already weathered extraordinary burdens.
And since the gulf war Kuwait, with a per capita income of about $23,000 and an estimated 10 percent of the world's oil reserves, has ended its once-generous aid to the Palestinians and Jordan.
But of the money that Kuwait still spends, fully half is devoted to Government salaries alone, Western diplomats said, while another third that is set aside for defense is used largely to buy advanced weapons for the Kuwaiti Army, still just 19,000-strong, even smaller than it was before the gulf war. In the fiscal squeeze that has resulted, Kuwait has run a budget deficit for each of the last five years.
At the same time, Kuwait's one-dimensional economy -- oil accounts for 90 percent of all revenue -- and its high rate of population growth have left planners nervous.
With the support of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, many officials argue that Kuwait must either cut benefits to its citizens, as Saudi Arabia did two years ago in the face of greater financial strains, or sharply reduce the number of foreign workers, who drain capital from the economy.
But even the much-touted postwar effort to shift jobs to Kuwaitis never got far off the ground. Kuwait's population, about 2.1 million before the war, plunged as Kuwaitis and foreigners alike fled Iraqi occupation. It fell to just 1.3 million by 1992, but even then Kuwaitis never held much more than one-fifth of the jobs.
The ouster of most Palestinians, Jordanians and Yemenis emptied Kuwait of some of its most numerous and best-educated groups of foreign workers. But as Egyptians, Pakistanis, Indians and others flooded here to take over neighborhoods and jobs as teachers, engineers, waiters, drivers and ditch-diggers, the population soared, and in 1993 it exceeded the 1.5 million figure the Government set as its postwar target.
Today, Kuwait's population stands at 2 million, 1.3 million of whom are non-Kuwaitis, according to the most recent Government statistics. Of a total labor force of 1.1 million, only 176,000 are Kuwaiti citizens.
"They treat us like servants," said Lal Hettige, a 33-year-old Sri Lankan accountant employed by a car distributor who is one of 16,000 residents of Bachelor City, a compound of cement-block units 12 miles north of the capital where foreign workers not permitted to bring their families to Kuwait usually sleep three to a room and work six days a week.
"No Kuwaiti would put up with what we put up with," said Mr. Hettige, a university graduate whose wife and child remain in Sri Lanka and whose salary of about $650 a month is as much as eight times what many other residents of the compound earn. "But the money is much better than anything at home."
At the nightly outdoor gatherings, known as diwaniyas, that are a staple of election campaigning here, political talk flows fast and furious, but it often focuses more on local issues like highways and sewers than the path ahead for Kuwait.
Near the end of one such discussion the other evening at a thickly carpeted headquarters that, like scores across the capital, was lighted with long strands of bulbs as if for a carnival, a Kuwaiti man fixed an American reporter and his Palestinian interpreter with a smile and stated what he said was the inevitable.
"The Palestinians and Egyptians teach us and the Americans defend us," said the Kuwaiti, who insisted on anonymity. "That's the way it's been, and that's basically the way it will always be."

Dow Average Sets Record, As Broader Market Slips
The Dow Jones industrial average rallied from a 53-point deficit to finish at a record 5,894.74, up 6.28, but declines in oil and semiconductor shares hurt the broader market.
Trading was sluggish, partly because of Yom Kippur and partly because investors were reluctant to take positions before the Federal Reserve meeting today to consider interest-rate policy. [Page D14.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities rose in lackluster trading ahead of the Fed meeting. The benchmark 30-year bond rose 8/32, to 965/32, sending its yield down to 7.02 percent. [D21.]
 
The Fed policy makers appear sharply divided. It is their last chance to alter rates before the Presidential election, and several Fed regional presidents are agitating for an increase of at least a quarter point in the closely watched Federal funds rate, the interest rate charged among banks for overnight money.

HEADLINE: Notion of Year-Round Schooling Is Slow to Win Over Los Angeles

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 23

 BODY:
They have seen lingering confusion and knotted-up schedules. They have been through broken friendships and canceled vacations, dropped classes and abandoned activities, sweltering classrooms and even hassles with the police.
The seasoned students of Los Angeles High School, who since sixth grade have been on the kind of year-round schedule that New York City is contemplating, predict that their East Coast counterparts will see much of the same -- but will eventually learn, as they have, to cope. 
 "It will be chaos at first," said Ileana Vasquez, 17. But "time heals; you adapt."
If students and parents interviewed here are any indication, the adapting to staggered vacations can take years, cost nerves and require contortions to calendar-juggle day care, off-time and activities. As soon as enrollment drops, Los Angeles schools tend to switch back immediately to the traditional year with a three-month summer vacation.
More than 40 percent of public schools in Los Angeles are on year-round programs. The year-round academic calendars "are seen as medicine you swallow to address overcrowding," said Mark Slavkin, a former president of the Board of Education of the Los Angeles Unified School District, which is second in size only to New York's system and has used the year-round calendar in some schools since the early 1980's.
But the year-round system has provoked accusations of economic-based injustice here because it is mainly the crammed schools in the city's poorer areas that have had to adopt it, Mr. Slavkin said.
Rudy Crew, Schools Chancellor in New York, has proposed a dose of the same medicine for some schools in his city, saying that crowding and budget shortfalls had made year-round scheduling inevitable. An experiment with year-round schooling could begin as early as next fall.
Angelenos say the medicine might be bitter, especially in the beginning. But they say year-round scheduling has pluses as well, like the smoother rhythm it gives to the year and the space it saves. The 180 schools on year-round schedules last year allowed Los Angeles to accommodate a student population that grew by 12,000, to about 640,000 -- and is still growing -- with far less busing and bungalow building than would have been needed otherwise. And the added costs of keeping air-conditioning and offices running all year were much less than busing or the building of annexes would have been, administrators said.
But the complications of the year-round system, under which typically two-thirds or three-fourths of the students are in school at any one time, can prove daunting.
Consider the experience of Yolanda Guerra, a private nurse in Culver City with three children in the Los Angeles school system. The three were all on different "tracks," meaning each had four months of vacation at a different time. "It was driving me nuts," she said. "We're from Belize, and we never had a vacation because of that. I used to have to go home by myself because if I took two it wasn't fair to leave one."
Backers of the year-round program say such conflicts can usually be avoided, and when Mrs. Guerra found out that the high school could put all her children on the same track this year, she successfully requested a uniform schedule for them.
Putting children all on the same track is not necessarily easy. At Los Angeles High School, where students have slightly longer school days to make up for the four full months each track has off, most of the sports tend to be oriented toward the A track, which has July, August, January and February off. The home economics and technical-vocational students are somewhat concentrated in the B track, which has September, October, March and April off. And the high-powered academic classes are geared toward the C track, which is off in November, December, May and June. Students whose tracks are different from their favored areas of study or activities either have to come in to school during vacation for things like band practices and football games, or miss out.
The splintering of the student body also leads to splintered relationships, some students complained. Alonzo Salazar, a Los Angeles High School senior, attributed the demise of a two-year romance in part to the fact that he and his girlfriend were on different tracks. Their separation, a much longer version of the usual "see you in September" mooning of high school sweethearts, amounted to eight months a year when they could see each other only after school. "You grow apart after a while," he said.
Even cross-track friendships tend to wither to the point that "you don't want to get acquainted with people not on your track because you won't see them," Ms. Vasquez said.
The six seniors interviewed said the staggered vacation schedules caused problems for communities, which must cope with loose students floating around all year, and led to encounters with the police, who tend to stop young people on suspicion that they are skipping school. "When you're off on vacation and you want to go to a park or something, they're always checking up on you because they think you're ditching," said Teresita Guerra, 17, Yolanda Guerra's daughter.
Then there is an obvious pitfall: hot classrooms. Charles Ballinger, executive director of the National Association for Year-Round Education, which lobbies for year-round calendars, said the best determinant in California of whether year-round classes would work at a given school was whether the building had air-conditioning. In New York, only about 60 of 1,100 school buildings have it.
But such transition pains do not deter believers like Mr. Ballinger from promoting year-round schooling even when crowding is not a problem. He, along with many teachers and administrators, see it as the calendar form of the future, once the country finally abandons the outmoded schedule that was tailored to a time when children were needed to help in the fields.
The principal of Los Angeles High School, Anne L. Felatico, sees year-round education as "the only way to go." She said parental concerns, be they football or vacation plans, could be accommodated, though "you have to work at it a little." Mr. Slavkin of the Board of Education said that businesspeople and taxpayers tended to agree, believing that using schools all year was common sense.
And Lloyd Houske, the principal of the Cahuenga Elementary School in a mainly Latino and Korean area of Los Angeles known as Wilshire Center, said that, given a choice, he would not go back to the traditional calendar after more than a dozen years on the year-round one.
"In a year-round school you can skip much of the review" that is needed to restart rusty students after the long summer break, he said. "And for teachers to have more than one vacation a year is kind of refreshing. There's less burnout."
Irma Munoz, mother of three children all on the same track at the Cahuenga school, said that she liked the year-round system because she could reinforce what her children learned at school during their more frequent long intervals at home. But she said she also knew many working parents who suffered trying to find baby sitters for the awkward two-month periods.
Mr. Slavkin, a longtime supporter of the year-round system and still a Board of Education member, said that the city did have many die-hard backers of year-round education but that they tended to be at schools where the system had been in place for 10 years or more.
More often, schools have switched back before new time routines have sunk in, and parents have often tried frantically to fight off the introduction of the year-round system in the first place.
There were also considerations of class, Mr. Slavkin said, because crowded schools in poorer neighborhoods protested that they were the only ones that had to suffer the inconvenience of year-round schedules.
"The equity argument was that it's not fair that some kids in mostly minority and poor neighborhoods are on year-round calendars, while kids in more affluent suburban areas are not," he said. The shift to year-round schedules has often drawn hundreds of incensed parents to public meetings and threatened the seats of school board members.
In 1993, a new policy allowed schools to choose their schedules, and more than 300, mainly in wealthier areas, went right back to the traditional schedule of having summers off. "The first chance they got, some of the schools, when they had the option to go back, they did, even if only for the year," said Mary Toma, president of the 10th District Parent-Teacher Association, which covers most of the Los Angeles Unified School District.
These days, only severely crowded schools, which are mainly in poorer areas, tend to be on the year-round schedule, and parents there tend to be resigned to it, both because they can see the crowding problems and because they prefer it to the only ready alternative -- busing some children elsewhere.
More schools may adopt the year-round calendar with new legislation signed by Gov. Pete Wilson this summer awarding schools an incentive of $650 per student to keep class sizes below 20 in primary grades. But opposition is expected to continue.
"I think the traditional calendar is just this incredibly enduring institution that people are reluctant to change," Mr. Slavkin said.

HEADLINE: NYC;
Fear And Shopping In Queens

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
ON the peninsula of two-story houses known as College Point, jutting into the East River, people refer to their part of Queens as their "town," as though it were independent.
"It's a nice quiet town," said Richard Calabro, owner of a shoe store on College Point Boulevard, the main commercial strip. A few doors down, another shop owner said: "People don't say they're from Queens. They say they're from College Point." 
 These days, they also say they're worried. Along the boulevard, merchants have their ears to the ground, listening for a loud sucking noise that will confirm fears that business is being drawn from the community's traditional center to vacant land less than a mile away. There, beside the Whitestone Expressway, giant discount chains are looking to establish a beachhead in College Point, familiar names like Price Costco, Staples and Toys "R" Us, the on-the-march empires of modern commerce.
"They're going to kill the main street, or what's left of it," said Fred J. Mazzarello, president of the College Point Board of Trade, whose member stores are already beleaguered by high rents and fast-changing ownerships. At an office-supply store, Diane Bux sees her business being strangled by the behemoths. And like many of her neighbors, she dreads an influx of cars and trucks (even beyond the increased traffic expected from other newcomers, like a printing plant The New York Times plans to open in College Point next year).
If all this sounds familiar, it is. College Point's agonizing over megastores is not new, there or in other parts of the city. But the matter has a sudden urgency because of land-use proposals from the Giuliani administration that are to be debated publicly before the City Planning Commission tomorrow and taken up by the City Council later in the fall. It is a complex issue with dizzying arrays of statistics, from both free traders who say the marketplace should take care of itself and preservationists who call the giant stores predators that should be stopped cold before they destroy neighborhoods.
Basically, the Giuliani camp would throw out a welcome mat for the big guys, allowing stores as large as 200,000 square feet (20 times the present limit) to move onto wide streets in zones now set aside for manufacturing. This no-muss, no-fuss approach is intended to sidestep resistant community boards.
UNLESS megastores find havens in town, says the City Planning Commissioner, Joseph B. Rose, New Yorkers will keep driving out to Home Depots and Kmarts in the suburbs, taking $3 billion a year in retail sales with them. As matters now stand, the city is "under-retailed," and old industrial areas sit there unused, he argues, adding that the administration's plan would create thousands of retail jobs without destroying neighborhoods or fouling the air.
That, opponents say, is bunk.
First, the $3 billion figure is exaggerated, they say, arguing that nothing will keep certain New Yorkers from driving to Long Island for shop-till-you-drop entertainment at the malls. Small stores in the city would suffer the most, they warn. As for the cumbersome review procedures of community boards, which indeed can keep projects bottled up longer than it took to build the pyramids, that's life. Neighborhoods, the opponents say, have a right to a voice in their future.
In this debate, New Yorkers seem deeply ambivalent, judging from a report by the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger (admittedly not a neutral observer, as a likely mayoral contender who denounces City Hall's "come-and-get-it approach"). Interestingly, her study notes that most people cherish mom-and-pop stores for giving their neighborhoods character, yet they are also charmed by the megastores' siren call of easy shopping and low prices.
MR. ROSE says they can have it both ways. But College Point fears winding up with neither -- that the giants will squash the little stores and then, as their shareholders see fit, move on. "We're afraid we will be left a ghost town," said Clara Spero, a Board of Trade official.
People remember the touted tax relief offered to real estate developers in the booming 80's. It seemed like a good idea, until an oversupply of office space produced neither tax revenues nor tenants in parts of Manhattan. To many in College Point, the megastores represent the same sort of economic Trojan Horse.
While City Hall waves off their fears as overblown, it might bear in mind that fear has a way of becoming a strong political force.

Coping With Year-Round School
Faced with school overcrowding and budget shortfalls, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew has proposed an experimental program of year-round school. A similar program has been used since the early 1980's in Los Angeles, where 40 percent of the public schools now use a year-round calendar. If students and parents interviewed there are any indication, adapting to such a change can take years, cost nerves and require contortions to calendar-juggle day care, off-time and activities. [Page A1.]
 
In Albany, Talk of a Raise
Many members of the State Legislature strongly believe that they will return to Albany after the Nov. 5 elections to give themselves a raise. Many adamantly feel they deserve a raise because their current base salaries were set in 1989, because fewer of them hold outside jobs than ever before and because New York City Council members are paid more than they are. But in an election year, many challengers around the state have recognized the toxic quality of the pay raise issue. [B1.]
 
Equal Opportunity Rejections
Getting into a co-op, always an excruciating experience, has become even more so, as co-op boards reject more and more applicants. The rejections, which have nearly tripled since 1987, are not limited to multimillion-dollar apartments on Park and Fifth Avenues, but are also occurring in less exclusive buildings across Manhattan, where prospective buyers were rarely treated as supplicants. [B1.]
 
Relishing a Crisis in Utica
One of the inexplicable things Edward A. Hanna did when he was Mayor of Utica in the 1970's was to declare that the city was "a lousy place to live." Another was to construct the Tower of Hope outside City Hall in honor of Bob Hope, who has no particular connection to Utica. So it has not surprised people that now, back in office after a hiatus longer than many careers, Mayor Hanna seems to be relishing the fact that Utica is in a financial crisis. [B1.]
 
Fear of Superstores in Queens
Beside the Whitestone Expressway, giant discount chains are looking to establish a beachhead in College Point, Queens. Less than a mile away, merchants along College Point Boulevard have their ears to the ground, listening for a loud sucking noise that will confirm fears that business is being drawn from neighborhood's traditional center. The agonizing is not new, but the matter has a sudden urgency because of land-use proposals before the City Planning Commission. NYC by Clyde Haberman. [B1.]
 
Early Jockeying in Manhattan
Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, has made no secret of her aspiration to run against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani next year, and the contest for her seat is already turning out to be a spirited one. Already, five of Manhattan's elected officials say they are serious about a campaign to replace her, and several others are deciding whether to enter the race for the Democratic primary in September 1997. [B3.]
 
Inquiry Into Peeping Complaint
Police officials were investigating accusations that some male officers secretly watched their female counterparts through a two-inch hole at a women's locker room in a Manhattan police station. [B3.]
 
Cornell Wins Housing Complaint
The United States Department of Education has ruled that Cornell University is not in violation of Federal civil rights statutes by maintaining two dormitories that attract mostly minority residents. [B2.]
 
New Focus for Adelphi Critics
In the campaign to oust the trustees of Adelphi University, the dual roles of its board chairwoman, Ernesta G. Procope, have loomed large. The board's critics have accused her of a conflict of interest for serving simultaneously as Adelphi's chairwoman and as owner of the brokerage handling the university's insurance. Now they have placed a price tag on the Long Island university's relationship with her company, the E. G. Bowman Company of Manhattan. [B5.]
 
An Arsenal on Long Island
Police officers responding to reports that shots had been fired on a residential street in Woodmere, L.I., said they made a surprising discovery in a two-story house: pipe bombs, machine guns and assorted rifles and explosives in a vast arsenal. [B5.]

New Charges for Ex-Fugitive
Alex Kelly, a former high school wrestling star awaiting trial on charges that he raped two girls in 1987, faced new charges after a car crash near his parents' home in Darien, Conn. The Darien police said Mr. Kelly was driving the white Nissan that zoomed past a radar post, speeded up when officers gave pursuit and then flipped over, injuring a young woman. Mr. Kelly, who fled to Europe after the earlier arrest, pleaded not guilty. [B5.]

HEADLINE: War on Drugs Urged at U.N. By Colombian

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 23

 BODY:
With the audacity that has made him the scourge of Washington, President Ernesto Samper of Colombia -- minus the American visa he lost in July because the Clinton Administration accused him of having ties to narcotics traffickers -- came to the United Nations today to propose a new global campaign against drugs.
Portraying himself as a victim of drug lords and the leader of a country that had been "demonized" by outsiders, Mr. Samper struck a third-world chord and received a sustained ovation. 
 In Washington, a senior official said today that Colombia needed to think less about international solutions and more on its internal mess.
American officials say 80 percent of the world's cocaine comes from Colombia, as does 25 percent of heroin now sold on the streets of the United States. Drug money has made corruption "endemic" throughout Colombian society, an American official said.
The Clinton Administration, with the public corroboration of some former senior Colombian officials, has said Mr. Samper accepted political donations from notorious traffickers in his 1994 campaign for the presidency. He has denied knowingly accepting drug money. In June, the Colombian Congress saved his presidency by dropping charges that his election campaign had been financed by the Cali drug cartel.
Since March 1, in part because of the charges against Mr. Samper, Washington has listed Colombia along with Afghanistan, Burma, Iran, Nigeria and Syria as countries failing to cooperate in the drug war. The designation meant an end to much of Colombia's foreign aid.
Although there have been well-publicized arrests of drug lords during the Samper administration, Washington continues to question the effectiveness of Colombia's efforts.
Mr. Samper came to New York on a diplomatic visa and said in an interview that he was under no special restrictions. He will also attend a commemorative conference on Tuesday marking the 35th anniversary of the founding of the nonaligned movement. He holds the rotating presidency of the group.
The Colombian President left home in a blaze of publicity after more than eight pounds of heroin were found in his official plane on Friday night, forcing him to take a chartered aircraft on Saturday. Today, the State Department announced that 11 members of the Colombian Air Force had been arrested in connection with the heroin.
Addressing the General Assembly today, Mr. Samper proposed a six-point plan against "narco-terrorism," saying drugs and terrorists were now inextricably linked and asking for economic aid for replacing illegal crops with legal ones.
Mr. Samper, who has a graduate degree in economics from Columbia University, also asked for controls on the sale of chemicals and weapons to drug producers and traffickers, for worldwide application of a European agreement against money-laundering and for an international intelligence center for narcotics information and eventually an international tribunal for drug cases.
Turning to the countries of high demand, he urged better programs to stop consumption.
"One cannot place the entire burden of drug fighting on drug-producing countries, which are the weakest link," he said, echoing a theme that resonates in other countries where narcotics are grown or manufactured.
American officials, who still cooperate with Colombia in crop eradication, say they have urged Colombia to impose stiffer sentences, freeze the assets of convicted drug traffickers and strengthen laws on money-laundering and extradition.
In the interview before his speech, Mr. Samper, who survived one attack on his life, said he was still the object of death threats. Some officials here said they believed that Mr. Samper might in fact be trapped in a vicious cycle, to some extent beholden to narcotics money and unable to come down harder on Colombian traffickers, even if he wanted to, without risking his life.
"The President of Colombia is always in danger," he said.
Mr. Samper argued that the Colombian Army had been fighting a war on two fronts, against narcotics trafficking and against guerrillas who are increasingly receiving money from drug traffickers.
He remains defiant about his relations with Washington. Taking away his tourist visa, he said, "raised my popularity in Colombia by 15 points."

Heating Oil Hits 5-Year High As Europe Draws U.S. Supply

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Heating oil surged to a five-year high as soaring prices in Europe drew supplies away from the United States at a time when stockpiles are lean and refiners are running close to full capacity.
On other markets, crude oil, gold and copper rose. 
 Heating oil prices in Europe, which have surged 40 percent the last three months, also reached a five-year high yesterday. The rally has outpaced gains in the United States, reducing European exports and attracting heating oil from the United States, where inventories are running 16 percent less than stocks in the similar period last year, the American Petroleum Institute said.
Adding to the concerns, the Coastal Corporation said that it had shut a 20,000-barrel-a-day unit at a Texas refinery on Friday after finding a crack in a pipeline.
Heating oil for October rose 2.21 cents, to 69.69 cents a gallon, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest since Nov. 7, 1991. October gasoline surged 2.76 cents, to 62.83 cents a gallon. November crude soared 70 cents, to $24.07 a barrel.
Crude also rose after Iran yesterday warned against the American military buildup in the Middle East since early September over hostilities with Iraq.
Gold jumped after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at its meeting yesterday. The decision by the Fed's Open Market Committee may allow inflation to accelerate, traders said.
December gold jumped $1.30 to settle at $385.70 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Copper surged after inventories fell more than expected, causing optimism that demand may be strong enough to absorb some of the increased production anticipated next year. The London Metal Exchange said its stockpiles fell 9,728 tons, to 282,881 tons, between Friday and Monday, the biggest drop since July 2. Copper supplies at the exchange are down 7 percent since August.
Copper for December delivery rose 1.5 cents, to 89.15 cents a pound, on the Comex.

The Critics Were Wrong

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
O.K., it's safe to say it now: The 1995 U.S. bailout of Mexico's economy with a $12.5 billion loan worked. Mexico has now repaid $9 billion of that loan, including $1.29 billion in interest, and the Standard & Poor's credit agency just upgraded Mexico's government bonds from "negative" to "stable." You may recall the Mexican bailout was fiercely resisted by most of Congress, but a few brave legislators (including Bob Dole) supported President Clinton when he essentially took personal responsibility for the Mexico loan by getting the money from a special Treasury Department fund, instead of Congress. If Mexico had defaulted, Mr. Clinton, and his top Treasury officials Robert Rubin and Larry Summers, would have been skinned alive. But it turns out they were right. Their critics -- Al D'Amato & Co. -- were wrong. So what have we learned?
Lesson 1. Thank goodness nobody did a focus group before President Truman announced the Marshall Plan. At a time when Congress is increasingly populated by nativist, anti-foreign-policy types -- who think that representative democracy is about accurate poll-taking, not exercising judgment -- it's a good thing the executive branch can still operate in a crisis without them. 
 Lesson 2. As in war, so in economics, without U.S. leadership nothing happens. Without a U.S. commitment of cash to rescue Mexico, the I.M.F. and the Europeans never would have joined in. In other words, without the G-1, there is no G-7. Unless America is ready to act unilaterally, it will never have allies with whom it can act multilaterally.
Lesson 3. Markets are important, but central banks still matter. The Mexican crisis was the equivalent of a bank run on an entire country, and the only institutions that could stop it were not the markets but the major central banks and the I.M.F. The global markets cannot just take care of themselves. "In the absence of the U.S. and I.M.F. the outcome for Mexico would have been much worse today," Mexico's Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, told me. "We would have had to declare a moratorium on debt repayments. There would have been lawsuits. It would have been a mess."
Lesson 4. Culture matters even more than central banks. To pay for the bailout, Mexico cut the standard of living for most of its people by 20 percent. There should have been a revolution, but there was barely a demonstration. In part this was because Mexicans were too busy just trying to survive, but mostly it was due to the strength of the Mexican family. "The family was a terrific social absorber here," said Antonio Madero Bracho, chairman of Sanluis, the Mexican mining conglomerate. "People moved in with each other, and the family really took the place of social security and unemployment insurance."
Lesson 5. The advocates of Nafta oversold Mexico. Yes, there is substantial political and economic reform happening here, but alongside it are still substantial graft, drug-running, political assassinations, weak police and Robin Hood guerrilla groups. The U.S. rushed into Nafta in response to the Europeans getting together and the Japanese walling themselves off. But Mexico was never our economic equal. Nafta will hasten the pace that it becomes one, but that moment is a ways off. Mexico reminds us that there is still a reason we call places "developing countries." "We oversold Nafta short term," argued Mr. Ortiz. "But in the long term Nafta will help consolidate Mexico's economic institutions and its place in the global economy."
Lesson 6: Diplomats prefer to do shuttle diplomacy in airplanes, not taxi cabs, but it's the taxi shuttles, inside countries, that now matter most. The increasing challenge of U.S. foreign policy is going to be dealing with the internal workings of allies and neighbors -- to help them make the transition from state-dominated, regulated economies to more open systems linked to global markets, without triggering social explosions.
Lesson 7: Yes, some investors on Wall Street benefited from the Mexico bailout. But sometimes governments have to do the right thing despite the fact that Wall Street benefits. (Wall Street also profited from the New Deal.)
Lesson 8: Mexico has undergone a lot of remarkable changes in this century, but one thing hasn't changed: its geography. It's still 100 million people on the U.S. border. What happens in Mexico still matters more to America than what happens in its own state of New Mexico.

HEADLINE: GONE FISHING WITH: Hoagy Bix Carmichael;
One Generation's Haunted Reverie Is Another's Pot of Gold

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

DATELINE: BREWSTER, N.Y.

 BODY:
UP a lazy river, Hoagy Bix Carmichael watched the brown water slide by and said nothing. While he was at it, he also did nothing, if you think that watching insects dance over the water and following the dimples poked into the surface by feeding trout are nothing.
At his side on a leafy bank of the east branch of the Croton River, his son, Ben, 13, chafed for some action. 
 "Can't we just try?" he asked.
The father regarded him indulgently. "You can try, Ben," he said. "But the trouble is that trout, unlike salmon, don't like a lot of thrashing around." He watched some more, then opened a small box of flies, picked a Tricorythodes stygiatus, hardly bigger than a dewdrop and perhaps half as heavy, and tied it to a diaphanous filament of leader just twice the thickness of a human hair. Now, he said, the boy could start fishing.
If fishing is, as Mr. Carmichael likes to say, a jerk on one end of the line waiting for a jerk on the other, it is owing to the prolific genius of his own father, the songwriter Hoagy Carmichael, who died in 1981, that he can indulge his obsession around the world and back in his own backyard (not a Hoagy Carmichael song) in northern Westchester County.
At the same time, the legacy takes a lot of tending, and the 58-year-old scion, who has something of the long face of his father, spends a good part of his time on what he calls "the Carmichael industry." (His younger brother, Randy, dabbles at the piano and is also busy managing a golf course that he owns in Cleveland and boating in Florida, leaving music management to the older brother.)
On Sept. 11, he took part in a ceremony in Shubert Alley to mark the Postal Service's issue of a 32-cent stamp honoring Hoagy Carmichael, the composer of "Stardust," "Georgia on My Mind," "Rockin' Chair," "Up a Lazy River" and other classics, as part of an American songwriters series.
He has been trying for years to produce a musical about his father and his father's circle, particularly the jazz cornetist Bix Beiderbecke, who died of overliving at 28 in 1931, and whose name the adoring Hoagy Carmichael merged with his own and gave to his firstborn.
Mr. Carmichael also serves as president of Amsong, an association of songwriters and heirs seeking to extend copyright protection for songs. He has produced television shows, including some years of the children's public television classic "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood."
Otherwise, if he is not out fishing, he is in his workshop, hand-building fishing rods as one of the leading craftsmen in the small trade. His custom rods made of bamboo from a small area of southern China take about 70 hours to make, and sell for thousands of dollars.
"I'm so lucky that in this world I get to do so many things," he said later after fishing, rocking in his father's old rocking chair in a stone house he is having rebuilt in nearby North Salem.
Mr. Carmichael grew up in California (or rather, he says, "I tried to"), where his father gravitated when fame catapulted him out of Bloomington, Ind., and the days of playing in the epochal jazz group called the Wolverines. Where the elder Hoagy Carmichael once lived in Hollywood, on Sunset Boulevard off Doheney Drive, is now part of the Dreamworks SKG entertainment conglomerate.
The father's first success was perhaps his greatest: As he told it in "The Stardust Road," his lyrical-Dadaist autobiography, published in 1946 and now out of print, it was 1927, and he was a young, unsuccessful lawyer crossing the campus of Indiana University one hot night, "sweet with the death of summer," when he paused to remember a passing love. A line came to him: "The memory of love's refrain."
"I looked up at the sky," Hoagy Carmichael wrote, "and whistled 'Stardust.' " Then, he said, he ran for a friend's piano. It took several years to get it on a record, but once lyrics were added by Mitchell Parish it became what has been called the most recorded song of all time, with perhaps 1,500 renditions and prodigious royalties. They would bestow economic freedom on the songwriter's son, even without other lucrative creations like "Georgia on My Mind," which was ubiquitous at the Olympics this summer in Atlanta, and which one year generated as much as $1.4 million in royalties.
But such riches are anomalous in an industry more known for penury. "There are 48,000 songwriters, and 46,000 aren't making money," said the younger Mr. Carmichael, who recently took over as president of Amsong from Mary Rodgers, the composer and teacher and daughter of Richard Rodgers, who wrote his songs with Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein 2d.
To protect their legacies, he said, the heirs of celebrity songwriters in Amsong have been pressing Congress for years to extend the copyright on songs composed before 1978 from the current 75 to 95 years after composition. For works composed after 1978, the group is seeking a copyright extension from the current 50 to 70 years after the death of the composer.
The way it is now, Mr. Carmichael said, writers of hit songs could live to see their creations pass into the public domain, costing them a livelihood. Opponents, however, have portrayed the campaign as an effort by wealthy heirs to protect their pocketbooks. He and Amsong are also fighting to turn back a challenge by restaurants now compelled to pay royalties for canned music.
Mr. Carmichael considers it only just that they pay. He asked, "Can I walk in and get a free steak?"
There are thorny new copyright questions as well, he said, adding, "I'm told there are 500 references to Dad's songs on the Internet."
For years, in a kind of payback to his father, Mr. Carmichael has been working to produce a musical based on Hoagy Carmichael songs. The work, once tentatively titled "Hoagy and Bix" is being recentered more on Hoagy, his son said.
He said a version was recently previewed at the Playboy mansion of Hugh Hefner, a friend, in preparation for anticipated tryouts in Cincinnati, Baltimore and Beiderbecke's hometown of Davenport, Iowa. Mr. Carmichael's hope is to get it to Broadway in time for the 1999 centennial of Hoagy Carmichael's birth.
Trout fishing was not something he learned from his father, whose interests ran more to the great indoors. "He drank a bottle of Scotch every other day and was never tipsy," recalled Mr. Carmichael, who said he himself could barely function after a glass of wine at dinner. He discovered fly fishing while on a trip to Canada for Expo 67. "I couldn't catch a thing, but I really caught the bug," he said.
And so it was on this late summer morning, with the fishing season in its waning days, that Mr. Carmichael put lesser cares aside and headed for the Croton with Ben, who was visiting from Maine, where he lives with his mother, from whom Mr. Carmichael is amicably divorced.
"Speaking of Grandpa's book," Ben said on the way, "next month, we have to read a biography."
His father was happy to oblige. "I have one copy of 'The Stardust Road,' " he said. "I'll give it to you."
"Cool," Ben said.
Wearing hip waders, they forded the shallow river to the opposite shore. "It always fishes," Mr. Carmichael said optimistically. "I'd hate to tell you how many fish I caught here." A few years ago, he recalled, he caught the biggest trout of his life here, a 24 1/4-inch brown, and someone he knew once came away with an eight-pounder. He scanned the water for a good while, watching little insects called spinners zig and zag, listening for the telltale pop of a trout's rising. "This is a patience game," he said.
He looked for signs of flying ants, which can drive trout into a feeding frenzy. "Don't ever go out without flying ants," he counseled. "If they're hatching, and you don't have them, you might as well get the keys to your car and go home." Alas, there were no flying ants to be seen.
"They're taking the spinners," he decided, tying a reproduction of the minuscule fly to a stretch of maddeningly snarlable 7x leader. "You prefer a male or a female?" he asked, straight-faced.
Despite his best efforts, however, all he managed after a few abortive strikes was a darling little brown trout of about 11 inches. "I don't like to have the fish I catch called 'cute,' " he pretended to grumble, promptly releasing it, as he does with all the fish he catches. His visitor then took one of about the same size, which, naturally, looked much larger.
"Well," Mr. Carmichael countered, "mine will be much larger by tonight."

HEADLINE: In Catholic School, Shared Values Include Rigor and Decorum

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
Along a wall of Sister Mary Scanlon's seventh-grade homeroom at St. Elizabeth School are two bookcases, one for the World Book Encyclopedia, National Geographics and biographies, the other for Bibles, catechisms and the "Saints Alive" series.
Sister Mary's students get the nuts and bolts of decimals, cell development and subjects and predicates, and they say prayers three times a day, starting with the Hail Mary and Our Father, and they attend a daily religion class. But like the books, belief and knowledge coexist with clear boundaries. 
 In New York City, 182,000 children attend schools like St. Elizabeth's, which is in Washington Heights. The city's Roman Catholic schools teach more children than the entire public school system of Detroit.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a graduate of Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School in Brooklyn, has long championed the academic rigor and decorum offered by Catholic schools. Now, he is promoting a $2 million effort, backed with money from businesses and philanthropies, to send 1,000 struggling students from the city's school system to parochial schools.
A day with St. Elizabeth's seventh graders helps answer the question that proposal raises: Exactly what kind of education would those 1,000 students get?
Sister Mary's 29 students use textbooks approved for public schools by the State Department of Education. Outside of religion class, the closest to a religious reference came last week during a geography lesson when Sister Mary exclaimed "Holy Toledo!" after one boy said Iceland bordered New York State.
Across the city, about 1 in 4 Catholic school students is from another faith, but St. Elizabeth's, at 612 West 187th Street, has a higher concentration of Catholics: 98 percent of the 620 students, an overwhelming majority Dominican. In Sister Mary's homeroom, everyone is Catholic.
In her midmorning religion class, Sister Mary devoted 10 minutes to the first five books of the Old Testament, writing the word Torah on the blackboard in big letters.
Then, from the New Testament, she had a student read several verses from the end of Matthew 11 aloud: "Come to me, all you that labor and are burdened, and I will refresh you. Take up my yoke upon you and learn of me, because I am meek and humble of heart: and you shall find rest to your souls. For my yoke is sweet and my burden light."
Sister Mary, her usually clipped voice softening a degree, offered an interpretation. "Very often we are in a situation where we feel we're the only ones who are feeling the way we do," she said. "Did you ever have an experience when a friend knew exactly how you were feeling?"
After class, she acknowledged that a student from another faith might feel alienated.
"As much as we talk about guarding against anti-Semitism, the children still see it all over the place, so their question is: Didn't the Jews kill Jesus?" Sister Mary said. "And I say, 'Well, no, actually the Romans put Jesus to death.' But they still ask questions like that, so I think sensitivity to those sorts of issues would be really important."
Across the hall from Sister Mary's religion class, Ricardo A. Mendoza teaches science. On a recent day, he divided the class into groups, gave each cluster a brown bag with an object in it -- tea strainer, egg slicer, cinnamon stick, sea shell -- and told the students to pretend it was the year 6000. What kind of people would have left these artifacts? Mountain people, said one group. American Indians, said another.
The textbook Mr. Mendoza usess, "Life Science" (Silver Burdett Ginn, a division of Simon & Schuster), includes evolution, and Mr. Mendoza said that like most Catholics, he easily reconciles the science with the Biblical creation story by explaining Genesis as a metaphor.
"Possibly seven days does not mean seven days," he said, "but maybe centuries or millions of years, figures of speech. I'm progressive. It's a matter of giving the kids a very wide perspective."
The archdiocesan Superintendent of Schools, Catherine Hickey, elaborated. "Science and religion coexist very nicely because we believe in natural law, and cause and effect," she said. "We believe natural law was put in place by God."
While Bible lessons are confined to the religion class, values -- respect, honesty, tolerance and nonviolence -- are everywhere. "Religion is not spoken of in every class," said Mary Ellen Eichmann, the school's associate director of development, "but there is this implied value of respect for one another, and that value is lived out here."
Research suggests that it is the emphasis on shared values and individual achievement that leads to the academic success of inner-city Catholic schools. Students of similar economic background usually outperform public-school counterparts in test scores, graduation rates and college entry.
"We very firmly believe in integrating things," Ms. Hickey said. "We're not just a brain or a body. We're an intellect, a social being and a spiritual being."
Across the city, in poor and middle-class neighborhoods where many parents worry about the public system, Catholic schools have a loyal following. St. Elizabeth's is in a neighborhood where gunfire punctuates the night, but the school recorded only one fight last year.
When the principal, Sister Noreen Nolan, walks the hallways, which she does frequently, she usually has her arm around a youngster. Instead of buzzers to signal the end of classes, one teacher on each floor is designated to ring a big brass bell by hand.
Teachers almost never have to quiet a class. Textbooks are covered. Homework is done on time. Led by a teacher, the students walk wordlessly in the halls, the boys on the one side, the girls on the other.
Nairobi Rodriguez, a sweet-faced 12-year-old with a ponytail and hoop earrings, did not want to go to St. Elizabeth's from Public School 189 last fall. "I was so mad at the beginning," she said. "I said, 'Why a Catholic school, with those ugly uniforms, and they're too strict.'
"But now I like this school. In public school, some of the kids cursed at the teacher, but here everybody listens."

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
The new Pan Am is rolling out an unusual frequent-flier program with an old name.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
WHEN Pan American World Airways is reborn tomorrow, with a daily nonstop between New York's Kennedy International Airport and Miami, and between Kennedy and Los Angeles, passengers can enroll in an unusual frequent-flier plan, named World Pass.
Economy passengers on the two-class carrier will receive one and one-quarter frequent-flier miles for each actual air mile flown, rather than the usual one mile, while first-class passengers will receive one and three-quarter miles. In addition, all passengers will receive 1,000 miles as an enrollment bonus. Members can earn a free flight after 20,000 miles, rather than the more common 25,000, while elite status -- with priority check-in privileges -- will kick in at 15,000 miles, instead of 25,000. 
 An unusual aspect of World Pass -- named after the former Pan Am's frequent-flier program, which was subsequently honored by Delta Air Lines -- is that up to three members, whether family, friends or foes, can pool mileage for free flights.
The drawback, of course, is that Pan Am's limited route structure means its frequent fliers have few destinations to choose from. But Martin Shugrue, a co-owner of the new airline, and a vice chairman and chief operating officer of the former Pan Am, said the new carrier would expand slowly but steadily. In two weeks it will add two more daily nonstop flights between New York and Miami, and it plans eventually to add routes between New York and San Francisco, Chicago and San Juan, P.R., as well as between Miami and Los Angeles.
The new carrier will fly wide-body Airbus Industrie A300's.
 
Air Fare Update
Fall air fares are not dropping like autumn leaves, as airline advertising might suggest, but for purchases through next Monday, it is still possible to find bargains on domestic flights and flights to Canada, the Caribbean and Europe. While travel dates differ by carriers, most domestic travel must be completed no later than Feb. 13, 1997.
For example, all the major carriers offer a $408 round-trip fare between New York and Los Angeles, based on a seven-day advance purchase and a Saturday night stay, with certain holidays blacked out. And the round-trip Chicago-San Juan fare is $338 on any of the seven major carriers that fly that route, based on weekday travel, a three-day advance purchase and a three-day minimum stay. A round-trip ticket from New York to London is as low as $298; New York to Paris is as low as $346.
 
Check That Battery
For the millions who plan to travel by car this winter, the American Automobile Association has some advice: Have the car battery checked, especially if it is more than two years old and even if it carries a warranty of four or more years.
 
Keeping in Touch
An independent survey for Marriott International found that 56 percent of all business travelers carry a personal computer and 80 percent of the computers are equipped with a built-in modem. Slightly less than half of the travelers (48.6 percent) carry cellular phones, while 7.6 percent carry pagers.
 
Hotel Update
Travelers bound for South America will receive a complimentary upgrade when they pay with the American Express Card at one of the nine participating hotels in a marketing alliance called Leading Hotels of the World: Alvear Palace and Caesar Park in Buenos Aires; Caesar Park and Maksoud Palace in Sao Paulo, Brazil; Hotel Carrera in Santiago, Chile; Hotel Bogota Royal in Bogota, Colombia; Hotel Oro Verde in both Guayaquil and Quito, Ecuador, and Eurobuilding Hotel and Suites in Caracas, Venezuela. The offer is valid through the end of this year.
When Hilton Hotels' Conrad International Centennial Singapore Hotel opens Nov. 8, it will offer introductory rates ranging from $142 (United States) for a single room to $985 for the Presidential Suite. After March 31, 1997, the rates will rise to $257 and $1,785, respectively. Tax and service charge will add an additional 14 percent to the bill.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Climb On Relief Fed Does Not Act

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices moved higher yesterday on relief that Federal Reserve policy makers left interest rates unchanged.
Expectations among market participants had been divided on what the Fed would do, with many anticipating a rate increase of about a quarter-point, while others expected the Fed would take no action. When the Fed made its announcement at 2:15 P.M. yesterday, prices, which had been rising, surged further. 
 While the decision by the Fed to take no interest rate action gave the credit market a lift, it could add to the volatility of the market in the weeks ahead.
If new economic data -- starting with the September employment report on Oct. 4 -- show that the economy is not slowing, then investors and analysts could decide that the Fed may have to raise short-term interest rates by half a percentage point or more when the policy makers meet again on Nov. 13.
Such an outlook, would surely send interest rates higher and could undermine the stock market.
By the close of the New York market yesterday, the price of the 30-year bond was up 15/32 , to 974/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.98 percent, from 7.02 percent on Monday.
The market experienced a mild selloff in the morning yesterday after the Conference Board's September consumer confidence numbers showed confidence at a six-year high. The 111.8 reading in the confidence index for September might have had a more pronounced effect on the market had the previous months reading not been increased to 112 from 107.
Prices were bolstered after the weekly Redbook survey of chain store sales, released in the afternoon, showed that sales were down three-tenths of 1 percent for the week ended Sept. 21. The report, along with a decline in the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi retail sales report, confirmed a view that retail sales continued to moderate through September, encouraging expectations that the economy might be slowing enough on its own to avoid a future rate increase. The reports bolstered the market before the Fed news.
Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist and managing director at ASB Capital Management in Washington, said the fact that the Fed did not ease rates increased the chances that the Fed will not raise interest rates this year. By the time the Fed policy makers, the Federal Open Market Committee, next meet, "the economic slowdown will statistically have been documented and that would preclude a tightening," he said.
There are several factors that may have persuaded the Fed to postpone a rate increase, Mr. Carpenter said. Fed policy makers typically look to the bond market for wide swings in yields.The bond market has been confined to a narrow trading range in the last six months, with the long bond yield moving in a range of between 6.90 percent and 7.20 percent, he noted.
The central bank also tends to be concerned about the dollar, which has been stable, and the price of gold, which is substantially lower than its early year peak of $415 an ounce, he noted.
By November, Mr. Carpenter said, the Fed should have all the information it would need to determine what kind of momentum was being transferred from the third quarter into the fourth.
The market will now likely turn its attention to coming supply, with the prognosis improved for the Treasury auctions this week, starting with today's $18.25 billion sale of two-year notes.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.13 percent, 12 basis points -- or hundredths of a percentage point -- lower than the previous day. The five-year note, which will be auctioned tomorrow, was being offered at a price to yield 6.50 percent, 9 basis points lower.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE RUNNING MATE;
In New York, Kemp Accepts Support of Police Union and Conservative Party

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
Jack Kemp brought the Republican Presidential campaign to New York yesterday, accepting the endorsement of the city's police union and telling the New York Conservative Party convention that he and Bob Dole would step up their pressure on the Senate to overturn President Clinton's veto of a ban on late-term abortions.
In a move to counter the endorsement of Mr. Clinton earlier this month by Fraternal Order of Police, the national umbrella organization for police unions, Mr. Kemp appeared at a gathering of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the largest of the big-city police unions, and pledged that a Dole Presidency would restore the nation's respect for the law. 
 Mr. Kemp offered no specific anti-crime programs before the police group, which had endorsed Mr. Dole before the New York primary in March. The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association has supported Republicans since 1976, when it supported Jimmy Carter after President Gerald R. Ford told the then-financially strapped city, in the words of a tabloid headline writer, to drop dead.
"If we are to protect our cities, like this great city, this great nation, our families, our wives, our children, and restore this country's respect for the law, we've got to have it embedded in our schools, inculcated in our children and families and churches and synagogues all over America," Mr. Kemp said.
"We've got to restore respect for the man and women who enforce the law," Mr. Kemp said. "We need to give our law enforcement agencies, those men and women on the front line, out there on the cutting edge of the war against crime and drugs, the tools with which they can combat this very serious challenge here on the eve of the 21st century."
Mr. Kemp said that one place to start was to place the Ten Commandments "in every public school, every private school," adding, "It ought to be on the desk of every child."
After hearing complaints from New York Attorney General Dennis Vacco about liberal judges appointed by Mr. Clinton, Mr. Kemp first said, "We need judges who will stand up not only for the rights of the victim, but for the rights of someone accused" of a crime, but later in his speech reversed his wording to say judges needed to respect not just the rights of the accused but those of victims as well.
The New York Conservative Party, which is closely allied with Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, one of Mr. Dole's most powerful backers, formally nominated Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp as its Presidential ticket today.
Mr. Kemp told the party that he and Mr. Dole would be pressing every Senator to vote to override President Clinton's veto of a ban on late-term abortions when the Senate takes up the issue on Thursday.
"Whether people happen to be pro-choice or pro-life -- and we happen to be pro-life -- no one can agree with the destruction of human life as that baby is just seconds away from what Moses said should always be chosen, human life," Mr. Kemp said. "I'm going to pledge to you, Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are going to ask every United States Senator to examine their conscience, to put this not to the test of politics -- right or left matter little when it comes to that precious human life -- to override President Clinton's veto of the ban against partial-birth abortion."
Mr. Kemp's visit here seemed aimed less at wooing New York voters, who are overwhelmingly Democratic, than in finding platforms to stay with the themes like crime and abortion that the Republican campaign has been weaving into its main message of tax cuts.
Earlier yesterday, speaking to factory workers in Grand Rapids, Mich., Mr. Kemp seemed to acknowledge that the strong economy had left many voters feeling that the country was already on the right track. But he argued that it would take the Republican policies of lower taxes and less regulation to create an economy with opportunities for everyone.
"The problem with this economy is not that we are not doing a little better -- we are," he said. "But it's not working for everyone."

HEADLINE: FEDERAL RESERVE MAKES NO CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
After weeks of speculation that the Federal Reserve would launch a pre-emptive strike against inflation, its monetary-policy officials met today and decided against raising interest rates, apparently in the belief that the economy is likely to cool off enough to keep prices in check.
Following its tradition, the Federal Reserve gave no explanation why it chose not to act. But the stock market soared briefly on the news, as did the spirits of the Clinton Administration, which had feared that a rise in interest rates just weeks before the election could undercut the Administration's claim that its handling of the economy had brought steady growth in the number of jobs while at the same time keeping interest rates relatively low. But the market, after the early afternoon rally, closed with a loss for the day. 
 The Federal Reserve's silence today concealed what appears to be a sharp split within its powerful Open Market Committee. The central bank has kept short-term borrowing rates steady since late January but agreed in July to lean toward an increase in those rates, its only weapon against inflation.
Last week, in an unusual news leak, Reuters news agency reported that 8 of the 12 presidents of the regional Federal Reserve Banks -- who are usually viewed as particularly hawkish about inflation -- were urging an increase in rates.
That leak was seen as something of a public challenge to the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, who has supported an unusual experiment: keeping interest rates stable even as unemployment has dropped to 5.1 percent -- a level low enough that many economists think it means that wage pressures are going to start to spread through the economy, causing an increase in prices. So far, inflation has stayed under 3 percent a year.
Mr. Greenspan asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into the leak. But more important, in refusing to act today he appeared to demonstrate his power to stamp down any effort by the regional bank presidents to mount a threat to his own authority.
Some analysts also contended today that Mr. Greenspan was reluctant to raise rates this close to an election. Such increases have occurred only twice, most recently before the 1980 Presidential election.
Whether or not that consideration was a factor today, President Clinton was clearly happy with what had happened. "I just think it shows we've got a strong economy with no inflation," he said. "I'm glad about that."
Indeed, a report today -- which came out after the Federal Reserve panel began its meeting -- indicated that the economy remained on track. The Conference Board, an independent research group, said that consumer confidence held nearly steady, at a six-year high, in September. Its index was 111.8, close to a revised reading of 112 for August.
The Republican response to the Federal Reserve's decision was both complicated and in some respects contradictory. Before it was known, Jack Kemp, the Vice Presidential candidate, argued forcefully against an increase, saying he would "bang on" the Fed if it squelched the forces of growth. Bob Dole and Mr. Kemp have made the need for faster economic growth a centerpiece of their campaign, and this afternoon Mr. Kemp cheered the Fed, saying it had acted properly because "this economy is not overheated."
"It's in need of capital and credit, oxygen and seed corn, and now we need a tax-rate cut like Bob Dole and Jack Kemp want," he said during a campaign stop in Manhattan.
But at the same time, Mr. Kemp appeared to acknowledge that the nation's low unemployment rate was one of the biggest obstacles to the Dole camp's message that the economy is on the wrong track. "Inflation is not caused by too many jobs, too many people getting jobs, and too many people working," he said.
Mr. Dole did not address the Fed's decision directly. Asked if it represented a victory for the President, he said only, "Interest rates are higher in every category under Bill Clinton."
Before today's meeting, slightly more than half the Wall Street analysts who regularly proffer predictions had said that they expected a modest increase in interest rates, probably a raise of a quarter of a basis point, or 25-hundredths of a percentage point. They pointed to the tightness of the labor market and recent rises in hourly wages as potential warning signs of future inflation.
But a jumble of factors -- some economic, some political -- argued against a change now, and in the end those won out. "This was a case where it was too close to call in substance," said John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers. "So there was a heavy dose of psychology, of waiting for more data, and some guesswork."
The statistical evidence that the Fed had to work with pointed in different directions. Poor retail sales numbers for the summer suggested that the economy was slowing, but some experts suspect those figures will be revised upward in coming months. Job growth has been robust, but the numbers for the summer are not always reliable because of the waves of young people moving in and out of the labor force.
"The risk was that if the Fed tightened and then the economy slowed down, the board would take the blame," said Paul Kasriel, the chief domestic economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
Mr. Greenspan has argued for much of the year that the economy will slow down in the second half, and his track record of predictions, while hardly perfect, has been good enough to give his view even more weight than the chairman traditionally enjoys when policy makers meet.
"He's been right a lot more than he's been wrong," said Joseph Liro, chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy, a New York securities firm. "And this decision truly shows that he is still in charge."
Though he is known as an inflation hawk, Mr. Greenspan appears to have been influenced by an argument advanced by the White House and many big-business leaders that the American economy has undergone a profound change, and that tight labor markets do not necessarily assure rising inflation.
Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, has argued repeatedly that competition -- both domestic and global -- is far more intense today than it ever has been, making companies far more reluctant to raise prices. At the same time, American workers are less likely to press for wage increases because they know that manufacturers who are unhappy with wage rates in the United States are freer than ever to move operations abroad.
But that is an untested argument, and many mainstream economists say that inflation has been delayed, not evaded. Many of them suspect that the Fed will move to tighten monetary policy -- that is, to raise interest rates -- at the committee's next meeting, a week after the Nov. 5 election.
On balance, Mr. Clinton seems likely to benefit from today's nonaction more than Mr. Dole will. The Administration can make the case that the Federal Reserve, an independent body, has ratified its view that the economy is neither too hot nor too cool.
That is a sharp contrast to the first few years of the Administration, when the White House barely contained its anger at Mr. Greenspan. The central bank raised rates seven times between February 1994 and February 1995, pushing the target rate for Federal funds -- the most important of two rates the Fed controls -- to 6 percent from 3 percent. Some of Mr. Clinton's advisers feared that those increases would choke off the economic expansion. They did not.
Then the Federal Reserve reduced rates three times -- in July and December 1995, and then again in January of this year. The Federal funds rate is now 5.25 percent and the discount rate is 5 percent.

HEADLINE: A Reckless Tax Cut

 BODY:
Bob Dole wants to cut everyone's income tax rates by 15 percent and throw in an extra $500 cut for every child up to age 18 -- a startling 70 percent reduction for a family with two children earning about $30,000. But, says a group of more than 500 economists, including seven Nobel laureates, the tax gift would be economically reckless -- crowding out valuable public programs and private investment that the economy needs to grow. President Clinton was cornered by Mr. Dole into offering his own tax-cut plan -- for families with young children, for college students and for employers who hire welfare recipients. These tax cuts are also tantalizing, but they too make little economic sense, as some of his own advisers admit in private. Yet there is a major difference between the two plans. The President's is too small to do great harm.
The Dole plan specifically names numerous tax cuts. But he is vague where he will cut spending to pay for his generosity. He mocks critics who say his huge spending cuts are implausible by claiming that his plan requires cutting only a nickel out of every dollar of Government spending. But combined with the cuts that Congress has promised, Mr. Dole's budget would require cutting almost 40 percent out of discretionary spending by 2002. 
 Mr. Dole's second defense is that his budget plan would spur growth. But as Paul Samuelson, Robert Solow, Kenneth Arrow and the four other Nobel winners made clear, the impact would instead be barely noticeable. Mr. Dole has his own stable of more than 100 economists, including four Nobel laureates, in support of his plan. But their case is weak.
Tax cuts can lift an economy out of recession. But the economy is now operating at full bore. For tax cuts to spur growth in this circumstance, they would have to encourage Americans to work harder and save and invest more. The Reagan tax cuts did not achieve these goals. Neither will Mr. Dole's. Another stain on the Dole plan is its unfairness. Poor families who owe no tax cannot take advantage of a child tax credit. But affluent families would profit from a tax cut on capital gains -- another Dole idea that he claims is the key to growth but that most economic analysis says is an economic afterthought.
Mr. Clinton's cuts are only a fifth as large as Mr. Dole's, putting that much less pressure on public programs. But Mr. Clinton makes plenty of small mistakes. He too fritters away money on a consumption-oriented child credit. He proposes a tax subsidy for students who enroll in college or job training and maintain a B average -- wasting money on families that would pay tuition without Washington's help, encouraging colleges to boost tuition and, eyeing Lake Wobegon, raise every student's grades above average. Nor will Mr. Clinton's proposal to enlarge a tax credit for companies that hire welfare recipients atone for his signing the Republican welfare bill. In the past, these tax credits have not worked well and have sometimes backfired -- signaling employers not to hire what must be a troublemaker if the Government is providing a bribe.
It is sobering to compare the 1992 and 1996 versions of Mr. Clinton. Then he proposed investing $50 billion a year in education, training, mass transit and national service. Now he proposes sprinkling inconsequential tax cuts. Campaign platforms are best read as declarations of priorities, not blueprints to policy. Read that way, Mr. Clinton's plan would do no harm even if he cannot figure out, with a Republican-controlled Congress, how to do much good. Mr. Dole's priorities risk damage.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE CONGRESS;
Lawmakers' Shift to Full-Time Politicking Won't Mean a Change in Routine

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 24

 BODY:
There is serious legislative work going on as Congress hurries to adjourn, but not so much of it that it gets in the way of politicking.
Leaders negotiated today over provisions to drop from the immigration bill and additions to the spending measure intended to keep the Government running after Congress goes home to campaign full time, maybe as early as this weekend. 
 But for many senators and representatives, the transition from part-time to full-time electioneering may pass unnoticed.
First, the leaders guaranteed that there would be no votes until after 5 P.M. today in either house, allowing a long weekend of campaigning. That was more than five days since the House ended its last roll-call at 3:03 P.M. Thursday. The Senate, where only 19 senators are running for re-election, stayed around to vote on Friday morning at 10:30.
While many of them were arriving after four or five days on the stump, there were still enough members around today to do this sort of work:
*Hold a pseudo-hearing in which Democrats, who cannot call real hearings because they are in the minority, denounced Bob Dole's tax reduction proposals as a threat to farmers, education, law and order and the National Weather Service.
*Hold real committee hearings. One featured Republican attacks on Boutros-Boutros Ghali, the United Nations Secretary General, who was accused of exceeding his authority, as Mr. Dole himself says frequently. Others concentrated on complaints that naturalization proceedings were being speeded up to produce more Democratic votes or that Agriculture Department workers were being hounded to contribute to political action committees.
*Vote without dissent, but without a roll-call, either, in the House to denounce persecution of Christians. No partisanship was involved.
*Vote to kill another resolution demanding that the House ethics committee release its counsel's report on charges against Speaker Newt Gingrich. The vote was 225 to 173, with 9 members voting present.
*Attend one or more of the 21 fund-raising events for House members and candidates to be held tonight, out of 100 planned for this week.
The lines are not always clear. There is politics in some of the substance, and substance in some of the politics.
The immigration bill, which would increase border enforcement and restrict benefits to legal immigrants, is a major piece of legislation with enormous political appeal in states with large alien populations and large numbers of electoral votes and seats in the House, like California, Florida and Texas.
So Republicans have been in constant touch with Mr. Dole, their party's Presidential nominee. Today they distributed a letter urging support for dropping a provision that he had previously backed intensely, one allowing states to bar illegal immigrants from schools. The intent was to make it look as though he was behind the change of course, but the letter arrived at the Capitol after Congressional aides had told reporters the decision had been made.
The politics in the Gingrich motion was obvious. It was designed to embarrass Republican incumbents in districts where Mr. Gingrich is unpopular and where the race is close..
But the Democrats, and the four Republicans who joined them, also believe that the House is better off when its dirty linen is hung out to dry in public. And many believe that Republicans on the committee are stalling. They think they are covering up something serious in the report on the September 1994 accusation that the Speaker had violated tax laws and misused foundation money for partisan purposes.
And there were no nonpolitical distractions in the "forum" the Democrats held on Mr. Dole's tax plan. Democrats had Larry W. Mitchell, a Texas farmer, saying the spending cuts the plan calls for would decimate child nutrition, agricultural research and food inspection programs. David Glover, a special-education teacher from Red Wing, Minn., complained that Mr. Dole's program "would divert $5 billion per year in public tax dollars to private and religious schools."
A Washington police sergeant, Marty Pfeifer, said the cuts would hurt the Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the prison system. And Bob Sheets, former director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami, said, "Even a 10 percent cut would basically do away with the Weather Service as we know it."
Nor was there much doubt about the purpose of a hearing that Representative Mark E. Souder, Republican of Indiana, held on naturalization proceedings.
"The evidence suggests," Mr. Souder told the Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on National Security, International Affairs and Criminal Justice, "that the naturalization push may have resulted from direct order of the White House to naturalize new citizens to register them as likely Democratic voters."
There is nothing original about any of these ways of doing business in the last days of a Congressional session six weeks from Election Day. But, with relatively little legislation to debate and vote on, these devices were what was left to them when the motive was "let's get out of Dodge," as Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado, described the House's mood.
"People want to load the wagons and roll them out," Mrs. Schroeder said.
It was obvious, to anyone standing outside the Capitol Hill Club or the Democratic Club, a few hundred yards from the House floor, what they wanted to load the wagons with. Tonight's 21 House fund-raising events, 6 for Democrats and 15 for Republicans, were only a start.
Before this week ends, the National Republican Congressional Committee will have run 80 such events, bringing in $50,000 or more, House Democrats will have held 20, Republican Senate candidates another 17, and Senate Democrats a dozen.
The Republicans have the edge on inviting names, too, with events like a New England-Style Fall Reception for Representative Peter I. Blute of Massachusetts. But the biggest haul of the week is expected to be the $3 million the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee plans to raise at Union Station on Thursday.
No wonder Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, got confused this morning when he was talking about leftover legislation in "the remaining days of this campaign -- er -- session."

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 20.71 as Fed Holds Rates Steady

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks ended lower yesterday as the Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady drew a classic buy-on-the-rumor and sell-on-the-news market response.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 20.71 points, to 5,874.03, just one day after closing at a record of 5,894.74. The Dow was also weighed down by a selloff in the stock of AT&T, which tumbled 5 5/8, to 51 1/2, on an earnings warning. 
 "We had a negative surprise from one of the bellwether stocks of all time," said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd.
In the broader market, advancing issues led declines, 1,238 to 1,081, on heavy volume of 460.2 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Adding to the market's mixed character, the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 3.80 points, to 1,215.27, reflecting strength in technology shares, attributed to a positive reaction to an Intel presentation and to industry upgrades by Morgan Stanley and Hambrecht & Quist. Intel rose 3/4, to 96 1/2, in Nasdaq trading. In active Big Board trading, Micron Technology rose 3 1/4, to 31 1/4; Texas Instruments rose 5 5/8, to 57 3/8, and LSI Logic rose 1 5/8, to 24 5/8.
But other market indicators slipped. The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 0.87, to 685.61. The American Stock Exchange index dipped 0.22, to 563.40. The Big Board's composite index of all listed common stocks fell 0.28, to 365.23, with the average share down 3 cents.
Several initial public offerings drew strong buying yesterday. Cross-Continent Auto, which operates six franchised automobile dealerships, climbed 6 to 20 in its debut. Hot Topic Inc., an apparel maker, rose 8 1/8 to 26 1/8 on its first day.
Apparel designer Mossimo extended its losses, falling 3 1/2 to 30 1/2 after sinking 6 7/8 Monday on its warning that its earnings would fall far short of analysts' expectations.
GMIS Inc. soared 6 3/16, to 23 5/16, after agreeing to be acquired by HBO & Company. The Fed's announcement in midafternoon initially set off a rally, sending the Dow up more than 30 points. A wave of selling soon followed, sending the Dow sliding more than 40 points before it reversed course yet again just moments before the close.
The Fed's decision, which had been anxiously awaited amid concern that inflation was building up, left the key Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans unchanged at 5 1/4 percent. The central bank also held the discount rate, which the Fed charges banks, at 5 percent.
Some analysts had expected the central bank to lift rates by a token one-quarter percentage point, which would have been the first rise in one and a half years.
Analysts said the market interpreted the Fed's inaction as a delay of an inevitable increase after the November elections.
Analysts cited a number of reasons for the choppy finish.
"The rally in stocks and bonds pulled back partly due to the dollar," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers.
Much of the afternoon seesaw activity in the Dow index was driven by a series of huge program trades.
According to Birinyi Associates Inc., a buy program initiated just after news of the Fed's vote added about 30 points to the Dow. That program was followed almost immediately by a sell program that wiped out those gains.

HEADLINE: In Clear-Cutting Vote, Maine Will Define Itself

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: ASHLAND, Me., Sept. 20

 BODY:
In Maine this political season, everyone is talking about one thing: The 10 million-acre North Woods, most of it owned by multinational paper companies, that help define the state's economy and its psyche.
They are talking about how far to go in redressing what everyone -- including the environmentalists, the Governor and the paper companies -- now agree has been years of industrial abuse. The spruce and fir forest that stretches across the northern part of the state was so dense 150 years ago that Henry David Thoreau, who hiked there, described it in his journal as "a standing night." Now it is crisscrossed with thousands of miles of logging roads, which run between vast clear-cuts where not a single mature tree remains standing. 
 Though the land is privately owned, the public has long enjoyed access to the North Woods for hunting, fishing, hiking and camping. Just as the state regulates hunting and fishing and development along lakes and streams in the woods, so has it for years established forest practices.
Now, a group of grass-roots environmentalists, led by a former gubernatorial candidate for Maine's Green Party, wants to ban clear-cutting altogether and severely restrict other logging practices in the North Woods. After collecting 58,000 signatures on Election Day last fall in favor of the ban, the group won the right to put a referendum on the November ballot.
But industry has countered with an alternate referendum that would restrict clear-cutting without banning it. Voters will get a chance to choose one of those proposals in November or to reject them both.
The stakes are high. Jonathan Carter, the former Green Party gubernatorial candidate, who lives with his family on a farm at the edge of the North Woods, said: "This is the last vestige of a great forest that is being destroyed. This is as important as saving the ancient forests of the Northwest."
With polls showing 70 percent of the voters favoring the ban last spring, the timber companies joined with environmentalists that are more friendly toward industry -- like the Maine Audubon Society and the Natural Resources Council of Maine -- and the Governor to propose their less stringent regulations. That alternative referendum, worked out in months of private negotiations between environmentalists and large forest landowners, is called the Compact for Maine's Forests. With the support of the Legislature, the compact was put on the ballot.
Each side says its referendum is the way to insure the health of both the forest and industry. The referendums would amend the state's 1989 Forest Practices Act, which is widely seen, even by many in the industry, as not stringent enough.
"This will be the first time the industry has allowed the public to come in and discuss their management with them in Maine," said Bob Perschel, the Boston-based regional director of the Wilderness Society, a national environmental group. The Wilderness Society has not taken a position on either referendum.
Maine's forest-products industry employs 32,000 people and generates pulp for paper and lumber valued at $5.5 billion a year. The state is the country's second-biggest paper producer, after Wisconsin. It makes paper for Time and National Geographic magazines and for The New York Times Magazine, as well as for lottery tickets.
Gov. Angus King, an independent who campaigned two years ago on a pledge to bring more jobs to the state, acknowledges that some restrictions are necessary, but he calls the referendum that would ban clear-cutting "a gun to the head of the Maine economy." He estimates that if it is passed, more than 15,000 jobs will be lost in the short term.
But Mr. Carter argues that the compact referendum "is a political document that virtually does nothing." Mr. Carter said the intention of the clear-cutting ban was not to stop logging, but to change it to a pattern of selective cutting that would keep the industry healthy. "We want the paper companies here," he said.
William Vail, who is executive director of the Maine Forest Products Council, the industry's trade group, and co-chairman of Citizens for a Healthy Economy, the political group formed to fight the clear-cutting ban, said the changes called for in the compact would "benefit the health of the forest, but they don't shut the industry down."
Recent polls have shown support flagging for the referendum to ban clear-cutting, and a poll last week in The Bangor Daily News indicated that 60 percent of the voters surveyed favored the more moderate compact referendum. The clear-cutting ban is backed by the Sierra Club on the national and state level.
Most Americans are familiar with logging debates about Federal land in the Pacific Northwest, where President Clinton ordered a reduction in logging in old-growth national forests in 1994 as part of a plan to protect the spotted owl. In Maine, the debate is over land that is private: the vast and uninhabited core of the North Woods, which stretches from north of Moosehead Lake and Millinocket to the Canadian border.
The debate can be found in places like Dean's restaurant in Portage Lake in northern Maine, where loggers gather for lunch; paper-mill towns like Rumford in the west; the state Capitol in Augusta, and cosmopolitan Portland, in the south. It dominates the front pages, the editorial columns -- which are unanimous in their support of the compact -- and the letters to the editor.
"You'd hardly know we have a Senate race," said Governor King, referring to the hotly contested race for the seat of Senator William S. Cohen, a Republican who is retiring. That race pits Susan M. Collins, a Republican who is the former New England director for the Small Business Administration, against Joe Brennan, a Democrat who is a former Governor.
The debate over the woods even takes place in the sky: The timber companies and the group advocating a ban on clear-cutting have been giving flying tours of the North Woods to politicians and reporters. The flight paths are different, of course. The timber companies show off expanses of green regrowth, while trips by those who favor a ban on clear-cutting feature miles of ugly brown swaths where clear-cutting has occurred.
Carole Haas, a computer programmer who lives in Cape Elizabeth, says she does not need to go up in a plane to see the damage. She has hiked through the woods near Millinocket. "It's hard to believe you're looking at something that used to be forest," said Ms. Haas, who is a volunteer in the campaign to ban clear-cutting.
"We're not tree huggers," she said. "We're not saying don't work the woods. The woods are the lifeblood of Maine. We're just saying work them in a responsible way."
Massive clear-cutting began in the mid-1970's to combat an infestation of spruce budworm.
The timber companies have one of the state's most powerful lobbying groups, and they have spent $1.8 million so far, much of it on television commercials fighting the proposed clear-cutting ban. The group seeking a total ban on clear-cutting has not had the money to put a single commercial on the air, Mr. Carter said.
While the debate has divided environmentalists, it has brought together paper company owners and mill workers, who are now fighting for the compact referendum. Maine has lost thousands of jobs in recent years as textile and shoe mills have shut down. Jobs in the paper mills, which pay $43,000 a year on average, including overtime, are prized.
"If we're not going to cut down any trees, we're not going to have any jobs," said Scott Grassette, a 30-year-old mechanical maintenance worker at the Boise Cascade mill in Rumford who followed his father and grandfather into work at the mill.
Thousands of logging jobs have been lost in Maine in the past decade because of mechanization. But the supporters of the clear-cutting ban say their referendum will create jobs. "The irony is that we're trying to save the industry from itself," said Jamie Sayen, the editor of The Northern Forest Forum, a bimonthly journal that covers issues related to the North Woods and the rest of the northern forest. "The referendum will mean more jobs for loggers' children and grandchildren."
If Maine sometimes seems like two states -- north and south -- then the debate has underscored the separation. The forest is largely in northern Maine. The votes, and most environmentalists, are in the more urban south, often viewed as more closely connected to Massachusetts than to remote northern Maine.
"We are not down to our last tree in northern Maine," said Robbie McKay, the leader of a group of property rights advocates in northern Maine who have been fighting bitterly against both measures. "When you have a clear-cut up here, trees grow back." She added, referring to southern Maine, "They have clear-cuts down there, but they call them shopping malls."
Near Ashland, Matt Libby's family has operated a sporting camp on a lake in the woods for more than a century. The land, which Mr. Libby leases, is owned by Great Northern Paper, part of Bowater Inc. Mr. Libby and his wife, Ellen, live in a log cabin made of spruce that Mr. Libby cut with a chain saw, and peeled and notched by hand.
"It was pristine wilderness 40 years ago, when I was a kid," Mr. Libby said. "The biggest change is the roads. If you go in a straight line, you'll hit a road."
He is leaning toward the compact. "It's not a park," he said. "It's a working timberland. Development is a lot worse than clear cutting."
The Lincoln News, meanwhile, has been crusading for the compact referendum in a series of editorials. One last week argued: "Although the 13 colonies that became states in George Washington's time may have done just fine without any regulation of their forests, it's a recipe for disaster in a nation of more than 250 million people consuming natural resources that are not infinite."

HEADLINE: The Joy of Deconstructing O.J.;
At a Symposium, Deep Thoughts and Cheap Thrills

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
The crowd that filled the auditorium on the Upper East Side of Manhattan one evening last week was stellar indeed -- writers, academics, lawyers, publishers, a judge, a Pulitzer Prize winner and assorted other thinkers of big thoughts.
What was on their minds was, by contrast, rather earthy -- violence, celebrity, money, sex, race. They had come to find meaning in the one soap opera (now in reruns) that mandarins are not afraid to admit they watch. 
 The O. J. case, that is.
Cabdrivers may claim to have lost interest in O. J. Simpson. His civil trial may be making miserable TV. But in certain circles, some of them rather erudite, the subject of Mr. Simpson remains a big draw.
Professors at Cornell University are putting together an O. J. research archive. There have been conferences among legal scholars about the Simpson case. New O. J. books pour into bookstores month after month.
The most recent, "The Run of His Life: The People v. O. J. Simpson" (Random House) by Jeffrey Toobin, who covered the case for The New Yorker, appeared on the best-seller list this month within days of going on sale.
Toni Morrison is scheduled to co-edit a book of essays on the case by the likes of A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., the retired Federal judge; Ishmael Reed, the poet and critic, and the scholars Patricia J. Williams and Andrew Ross.
And the 92d Street Y in Manhattan, that venerable bastion of edification known for lectures on subjects like neurobiology and the world economy, has put three separate evenings of O. J.-related events in its 1996-97 program.
So what's the attraction? Social significance, or cheap thrills?
"Intellectuals are people, too," said Dr. Bruce Lewenstein, an associate professor at Cornell who is working on the Simpson archive with the help of a National Science Foundation grant. "We need excitement just like everybody else. We need good stories to hook our interest and tie our tables to."
Or, as Mr. Toobin put it: "It's a tabloidy guilty pleasure but it's also an important historical event at this point. To put it another way, this case has everything that obsesses the American people. It has sex, violence, race, Hollywood, sports. And the only eyewitness is a dog."
Let the record reflect: the panel discussion at the 92d Street Y last Wednesday was not, not a frivolous event. "The Law According to O. J.," read the topic printed on the cream-colored invitations mailed out by Random House and The New Yorker. "How the Simpson Trial Changed the Legal System."
The assembled panel was also impeccably august. (No talk show hosts without last names.) There was Randall Kennedy, the Harvard Law School professor; Judge Kimba M. Wood of Federal District Court in Manhattan, and Linda A. Fairstein, who heads the sex crimes unit for the Manhattan District Attorney.
Also on the panel were Mr. Toobin and Barry C. Scheck, the former Simpson defense team member who is a faculty member at Benjamin N. Cardozo Law School. The moderator was the impressively credentialed Fred Graham -- television anchorman, lawyer, award-winning journalist, Fulbright scholar.
But the big picture proved an elusive target. Much of the evening ended up being spent obsessing, yet again, over the blood on the socks, the bloody glove, whether Marcia Clark blew it, whether the police conspired, whether the defense went too far, what to make of those jurors.
If the trial had changed anything, it began to seem, it had changed the idiom. Obscure O. J. references whizzed by without translation. References to "the Bundy blood drops" and what juror No. 8 said on "Nightline" seemed to have acquired all the currency of Ross and Rachel's romance on "Friends."
So what had drawn this well-educated lot, some of whom had left their chauffeured black town cars idling by the curb? Harold Evans, the president and publisher of Random House, was asked in an interview: Was it their earnest interest in legal implications, or was it the titillating nature of the case?
"Well," Mr. Evans said matter-of-factly, "I think the latter would be predominant."
As for Mr. Evans, he had another agenda. By co-sponsoring the event with the 92d Street Y and The New Yorker, Random House was using the Y to help promote Mr. Toobin and his book. Just as Mr. Evans's wife, Tina Brown, the editor of The New Yorker, was using the Y to help promote The New Yorker and Mr. Toobin.
Ushers dispensed free copies of the current issue of The New Yorker to audience members as they left the auditorium after the discussion. And in a reception room next door, Mr. Toobin's book was on sale. The author himself briefly settled in behind a table to sign copies.
Upstairs, Random House and The New Yorker held a private dinner party in honor of Mr. Toobin with 150 invited guests including the lawyers Floyd Abrams and Ronald L. Kuby; the television personalities Chuck Scarborough and Jane Pauley, and Garry Trudeau, the cartoonist, who is married to Ms. Pauley.
Ms. Brown described the O. J. Simpson panel discussion as a "positioning event" to "reinforce links" between the magazine and a natural audience, the kind of people who attend talks at the Y. "It's a more subliminal approach," she said. "You get a lot of return on a small investment."
Mr. Evans, who at Random House has enlisted publicists from the film industry to experiment with new ways of promoting books and reading, said it would be accurate to describe his motivation in co-sponsoring the Simpson discussion as enlightened self-interest.
"Would I do it if I wasn't running Random House?" he said. "No.
"Would I attend such a function if I wasn't connected to Random House? Yes."
The subject of Mr. Simpson is, after all, more than simply provocative, several academics who have thought or written about the case insisted in recent interviews. They suggested that high-profile dramas, not unlike catastrophes, have at least the potential to shed new light on broader public concerns.
For example, the researchers at Cornell said their new Simpson archive -- legal papers, trial videotape, cartoons and other material relating to the use of DNA fingerprinting in the case -- is intended for the use of researchers interested in the issue of how society accommodates new technology.
And Dr. Christopher B. Mueller, a professor at the University of Colorado School of Law who helped organize a conference on the case earlier this year, said the spectacular nature of it simply insures a level of familiarity with the facts that makes it possible to examine deeper issues.
Not that the mere facts have lost their appeal, either.
Sylvia Cutler of Fort Lee, N.J., who attended the discussion at the Y, described herself as still "absolutely obsessed" with the case -- more obsessed than she had been with anything since Adlai Stevenson's Presidential campaign in 1952.
Miss Cutler said she had become absorbed almost immediately after the murder of Mr. Simpson's wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, on June 12, 1994. She had followed every new development, through Mr. Simpson's arrest on murder charges, his trial and his acquittal.
Now she was tracking the trial of the wrongful-death suit filed against him by Mr. Goldman's family and Mrs. Simpson's estate. Miss Cutler said she was heading straight home from the Y to catch a rerun of Geraldo Rivera's regularly scheduled O.J. post-mortem.
She said a friend, equally mesmerized, recently asked her: "When are we going to let go?"

Chart: "Another Take on the Case"
Some people probably thought the bloody glove was just a piece of evidence. Hah. Didn't they really know it's a window into police misconduct, America's obsession with race and the collapse of the criminal justice system?
 Public fascination with O.J. may have faded, but lots of intellectuals are still enthralled. Here are a few of the big ideas lurking, in their view, behind the endlessly analyzed features of the case.

 BODY:

Fed Leaves Rates Steady, Cheering Administration
After weeks of speculation that the Federal Reserve would take a pre-emptive strike against inflation, its monetary policy officials decided not to raise interest rates, apparently believing the economy is cooling enough.
The inaction cheered the Clinton Administration, which had feared that a rate rise just weeks before the election could undercut the Administration's claim of success in handling the economy, creating record employment. [Page A1.]
 
Treasury prices moved higher. Traders were relieved by the inaction, and the yield on the 30-year bond fell below 7 percent. [D16.]
 
Stocks were mixed, with blue chips dragged down by AT&T's slide. The Dow industrials fell 20.71 points, to 5,874.03, but the Nasdaq Composite rose 3.80, to 1,215.27, on strength in technology shares. [D6.]
 
Paper Industry In a Political Storm
In Maine, where the forest-products industry employs 32,000 people and generates pulp for paper and lumber valued at $5.5 billion a year, this political season, everyone is talking about one thing: The 10-million-acre North Woods and how far to go in redressing years of industrial abuse. [A1.]
 
I.B.M. to Introduce Revised OS/2
I.B.M. plans to introduce the latest version of its OS/2 software, code-named Merlin today. But even I.B.M. executives concede that the new program lacks the legerdemain to make Microsoft's popular Windows disappear. [D2.]
 
Sun-Diamond Found Guilty in Gifts
Sun-Diamond Growers of California was found guilty of illegally giving more than $9,000 worth of gifts to former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy when his department was considering action on issues important to the group. Mr. Espy, who resigned under pressure in December 1994, was not charged. [A17.]
 
Loewen Rejects $3.1 Billion Bid
The Loewen Group, striving to remain an independent competitor, rejected a $3.1 billion stock offer from the Service Corporation, the world's largest chain of funeral homes. Analysts expected a new Service bid. [D3.]
 
Suit Against H. B. Fuller Dismissed
A wrongful death lawsuit filed against the H. B. Fuller Company of St. Paul, a leading adhesive manufacturer, was dismissed by a Federal judge in St. Paul, who said it should be tried in Guatemala. The suit was filed by the family of a Guatemalan teen-ager who died in 1993 from the effects of sniffing glue. [D5.]
 
Investment Advisers Watch Suit
If the Thompson family of Knoxville, Tenn., succeeds in an unusual lawsuit against Glenmede Trust of Philadelphia, lawyers say big changes could ensue in the way investment advisers do business. Market Place. [D6.]
 
Pro-Bono Campaigns to Fight AIDS
Peter Rogers, creator of the Blackglama mink campaign, is producing a series of celebrity-filled print ads for Gay Men's Health Crisis. More than 20 magazines have agreed to donate more than $1 million worth of space. Also, a print campaign, created pro bono by Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York will promote the Race to Deliver, a four-mile footrace through Central Park on Sunday to raise funds for God's Love We Deliver, which feeds homebound AIDS patients. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D5.]

HEADLINE: No Sympathy for Ex-Wives

 BODY:
To The Living Section:
God forbid ex-wife Susan Wexler shouldn't be able to afford a housekeeper ("Ex-Wives of the Rich and Famous See a Film and Pronounce It Fact," Sept. 18). After 51 pampered years it would be extremely cruel to suddenly force her to start living like an ordinary person.
I plan to see "The First Wives Club" because I'm a fan of the three lead actresses and the premise seems like a very rich one. As an underemployed intellectual, I have my own source of resentment toward plutocrats who feel that their money exempts them from ordinary standards of decency. But don't think I have any particular sympathy for the women who marry them. 
 And why did you make no mention of the middle- and lower-class women who suffer real economic hardships after divorce? The Op-Ed piece on gender gaps from the day before ("Misreading the Gender Gap") had the story of a divorced woman forced onto welfare. Were you afraid an anecdote like that might have compromised the white-shoe tone of your story?

HEADLINE: Career Changers, Beware!

 BODY:
To The Living Section:
It was with great amusement that I read about professionals moving into the kitchen and the reaction of others ("Out of the Rat Race and Into the Kitchen," Sept. 11).
This month is my ninth anniversary as a culinary professional, after having been an executive recruiter in the data processing and financial fields for 11 years. 
 I welcome all of you career changers and dreamers. I hope you have the passion and the love of food and the industry that I do. Long hours and nights, sometimes 14 hours a day (10 to 12 in a row). Poor working conditions, poor equipment, inarticulate employees, inconsistent/incompetent management, cutthroat suppliers, etc. Just like the "real world."
Great money, if you have deep pockets, or know of them. Otherwise, you find yourself being shortchanged with mediocre benefits. Guess what: you, too, can be laid off! There are plenty of jobs out there. But for some reason the offers seem to be 15 percent to 25 percent below what you are making (sound familiar?).
So, after four months of unemployment, I am going back to work, this time in sales. No desk for me, and no one asking, "Why are there red threads in the saffron rice?"

Per-capita income in New Jersey grew faster than inflation last year but slightly slower than the national average, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The state's per-capita income -- total annual income divided by population -- went up 5.1 percent in 1995, to $29,848. The national rate of per-capita income growth was 5.3 percent. New Jersey's status as the second-wealthiest state (after Connecticut) was unchanged.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
U.S. Economy Is Off Track, Dole Declares

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 24

 BODY:
In an hourlong address today, Bob Dole stepped up his attacks on President Clinton and signaled that he was returning full-bore to his economic message.
"In every state I visit, every talk show, at every rally I address, I will be saying to the American people that you know how to spend your money better than the Government," the Republican Presidential nominee said to more than 500 people at the Economic Club of Detroit. "I will be saying that this economy is not good enough and not on the right track." 
 He said that in families with two wage earners, "one spouse works full time for the family, and the other spouse works full time to pay taxes to the government."
Mr. Dole suggested that President Clinton's inclination toward "activists meddling in expansive Government," as revealed in his failed health-care plan, resulted not from his being "a finger-in-the-wind politician who is waiting for the polls," but from a deep-seated, liberal predisposition to tax and spend.
Citing Mr. Clinton's 1993 tax increase and his "pork barrel" stimulus package, Mr. Dole declared, "These are the actions of an old-style, dyed-in-the-wool, big-spending liberal committed to a government that spends and spends and taxes and taxes." And he warned, "These are the actions of someone who, once the spotlight of the campaign has turned off, will take every opportunity to increase the size of Government even as he decreases the size of your wallet."
Mr. Dole said that as a percentage of gross domestic product, "Federal taxes are now at the highest level in history, the Government is taking more out of our economy than ever before in history, and families are working longer and harder but taking home less."
As an example of a tax increase that Mr. Dole said lurked in a second Clinton term, he said that Bruce Babbitt, Mr. Clinton's Interior Secretary, had just last week proposed a tax on outdoor equipment, including binoculars and bird seed.
But Mr. Babbitt did not propose this tax. It evolved over the last several years from state environmental and parks officials who said that because their state governments were too strapped for cash to maintain wildlife and conservation projects, they wanted a user fee on outdoor equipment. Hunters have paid such fees on guns and ammunition since the 1930's to help restore wildlife.
Naomi Edelson, the wildlife diversity director for the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, which heads a bipartisan coalition of 1,200 organizations that support the fee, said she informed the Dole campaign a week ago that Mr. Dole's characterization of Mr. Babbitt's role was not accurate. She said Dole aides had asked for more information, which she faxed to them.
"It has nothing to do with the Clinton Administration," she said in a telephone interview today from Washington.
Whatever the source of the proposal, Mr. Dole drew chuckles from his Detroit audience today as he ridiculed it as an example of the Administration's tendency toward excessive taxation.
"If they get their way," Mr. Dole warned, in a waltz into unscripted terrain, "you won't even be able to escape the I.R.S. when you're hiking. They'll suddenly be walking along with you, somebody from the I.R.S., saying: 'You having a good time? Have you paid your taxes? Have you fed the birds? Have you looked in your binoculars? If you haven't, you don't have to pay the tax. You don't feed those birds, you're all right.' "
Mr. Dole cited several statistics in his comments on the state of the economy, including those on the trade deficit.
"Just the other day," he said, "the President's own Department of Commerce reported that the U.S. goods and services trade deficit in July reached a four-year
 high, $11.7 billion, an incredible 43 percent jump from June.
"That represents another slice out of U.S. economic growth, which is the disaster for American workers and their families."
 After spending most of his time lambasting Mr. Clinton and his policies, Mr. Dole outlined his own economic proposal -- including a 15 percent cut in Federal income taxes, a $500-per-child tax credit and a halving of the capital gains tax rate, to 14 percent from 28 percent -- as a sound way to restore economic growth.
Recommending his book, "Trusting the People," which describes how he would simultaneously cut taxes and balance the budget, Mr. Dole said: "The bottom line: Under our plan, a family of four making $30,000 will save $1,261 on their Federal tax bill."
Joe Lockhart, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said that despite Mr. Dole's "negative attacks, the economy is on the right track." Mr. Dole's plan would lead to cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, education and environmental programs "even deeper than last year's Dole-Gingrich budget," Mr. Lockhart said.
Meanwhile, a battle over endorsements was escalating between the Clinton and Dole campaigns.
The Dole campaign ran an advertisement on Monday in USA Today boasting that more than 100 economists and 4 Nobel laureates had endorsed the Dole economic plan.
Today, the Clinton campaign countered by pointing to a statement by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research institute in Washington, denouncing the Dole plan as "not credible" and saying it would lower future living standards. It was signed by 546 economists, including 7 Nobel Prize winners.
The Dole campaign also released a list of 195 executives from high-tech companies in Silicon Valley who endorsed Mr. Dole's plan.

Muzzling a Vicious Pit Bull: Debt

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:

THE INDEBTED SOCIETY
Anatomy of an Ongoing Disaster
By James Medoff and Andrew Harless
Illustrated. 241 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $24.95.
 
Most people juggling their multiple credit-card accounts might blame their mounting debts on a general failure of character, or at least on the late-20th-century mushrooming of too-easy ways to run up bills.
But James Medoff and Andrew Harless, respectively a professor of labor and industry at Harvard and a financial consultant with a doctorate in economics from Harvard, offer a kinder, less judgmental explanation in "The Indebted Society: Anatomy of an Ongoing Disaster," a study that looks deeply into the comings and goings of money, mostly the goings. 
 Mr. Medoff and Mr. Harless write that the slower productivity growth and stagnant wages of the 1970's placed American wage earners in a squeeze, and that by putting ourselves in debt we were partly trying to maintain our standard of living and partly trying to comfort ourselves with possessions.
Besides, we consumers weren't the only ones to sin, the authors add. Debt was general all over the economy. The Federal Government sinned, too, with the help of Reaganomics's attempt at a supply-side solution to our malaise. And corporations, too, thanks to the United States Tax Code and "a changing ethos in the American boardroom."
As a result, the American economy descended into a hell of "interlocking vicious circles": in one of them, corporate debt and reduced productivity nip at each other's heels; in another, low savings and slow productivity growth bite each other's tails. The authors love a metaphor. "This vicious circle, this pit bull foaming at the mouth, what damage has it done so far?" they ask. "It will take more than rabies shots to resuscitate growth in U.S. living standards!" So as well as the dismal science, as Carlyle named economics, we get a dismal sense of the mess we're in.
Yet Mr. Medoff and Mr. Harless identify culprits and a possible way out of the morass. The culprits are the people who lend, much swollen in number and wealth these past few decades; not menacing sharks or top-hatted men with gold chains, but ordinary citizens who invest in bonds and live on the interest. And they are supported by the members of the Federal Reserve Board, who put too much stock in "the NAIRU -- the 'non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment' (also known as the 'natural rate of unemployment')," which the authors characterize as a damnable chimera.
If only the Fed would realize that the evidence for this concept is shaky at best, the authors lament. Then it would stop worrying that unemployment below a certain point is inflationary, and it would take the productive step of lowering interest rates as the economy heats up, instead of raising them and strangling the economy, as it now tends to do. The authors grant that pushing for lower interest rates may seem illogical in a book "about the ill effects of debt." Yet their evidence is that "low interest rates don't really encourage borrowing," but stimulate the economy in various other ways.
But the Fed won't cut interest rates, they conclude, because its members aren't accountable to anyone or anything except a theory that appears objective yet isn't. So the hope the authors see lies in building a broad political consensus in favor of tapping the "slack resources" of the economy through "smart" Government spending and in reducing the Federal deficit by, um, raising taxes. Or if taxes are unacceptable in the present climate, then try tax-sheltered savings, because "a policy that successfully raises the U.S. private-saving rate is just as good as a policy that reduces the deficit."
One striking thing about "The Indebted Society" is how defensive and apologetic its authors seem for offering a liberal, Keynesian solution to the ills of indebtedness. As if to forestall criticism, they call themselves "bleeding hearts" for sympathizing with the poor and chronically unemployed. "Call us communists, if you must," they write elsewhere, "but we think that people who make a lot of money should pay most of the new taxes."
They are loath to call anyone a real villain, stressing that the lenders are often the borrowers as well and emphasizing the good intentions of the members of the Fed. And they mention several times the value of the police and military defense to the American polity, as if eager to distinguish themselves from old-line, leftward-leaning liberals.
All the same, their anatomy of the indebted society is clear and precise, and full of sensible proposals for measuring even more accurately our economic blood pressure and pulse. If you agree with even half their logic, the proposal of a tax cut now will seem altogether ridiculous. "Cutting taxes has the effect of raising government borrowing and reducing government investment, so as to intensify the vicious circle," they conclude. "In a democracy, tax cutting is the natural part of the vicious circle of undersaving and underinvestment."
Their book even makes you believe that if we were free of debt, we might not need the naughty thrill of running up our credit-card accounts. Just think, a month without unpayable debts! It might not be so boring.

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MASON 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
FOR five days, a chateau-hopping gaggle of prosperous Americans had savored the best Paris had to offer, ogling its Gobelin tapestries, inspecting its tortoise-shell Boulle cabinets, sampling the finest Champagnes and sating themselves on foie gras.
No less a personage than Bernadette Chirac, the wife of the French president, had personally escorted the group including Anne Cox Chambers, the communications heiress; Martin Gruss, the prominent investment banker, and his couture-clad wife, Audrey, through the Elysee Palace and into the garden to inspect her prized ducks. 
 And now it was time for the payback. "So," Mrs. Chirac asked, with a fearsome smile, "did you buy anything?"
Lured by an aggressive marketing campaign, a record number of wealthy Americans have been drawn to the city for the Biennale Internationale des Antiquaires, the world's ritziest antiques fair, at the Carrousel du Louvre. And suddenly Parisians renowned for their Gallic hauteur have been engaged in the delicate art of courting Americans, the better to liberate them from their millions.
Clearly the strategy has been successful: Two weeks after the biennial's opening, Americans had accounted for half of its sales, and 60 percent of its gross.
Why travel all the way to Paris to pay a hefty premium for pieces of "F. F. F." (as fine French furniture is known in the trade), many of which could have been bought more cheaply, and conveniently, in New York? Clearly, the French franc is an infinitely more chic currency to be relieved of.
"Anyone can have English," said Roger Prigent, a New York antiques dealer. "For me, it shows that the super-rich want 18th-century French furniture from the golden age. It's about real quality."
Princess Laure de Beauvau-Craon, the president of Sotheby's office in Paris, observed, "Many Americans feel that when they buy French objets d'art in Paris they are purchasing something that is somehow more authentic." Will Iselin, who is the head of the international furniture department at Christie's, described the biennial, which opened Sept. 12 and ends Sept. 29, as "pure theater, and the only thing that can rival the drama of the auction room." Referring to its 120 exhibitors, he said: "What else are they going to do? Just sit back in their shops and wait for customers?"
Hardly. So dramatic is the contrast between the rarefied atmosphere inside the biennial and grim daily reports in Le Monde about the economy, strikes and general malaise that one expected Marie Antoinette herself to burst forth any moment with a cry of "Let them buy Boulle!"
And French dealers are racing against time: the international auction world is coming to town, thanks to a change in French law that will permit Sotheby's and Christie's to begin holding auctions in France for the first time in January 1998, breaking a national monopoly established by Henri II in 1522.
"Sotheby's and Christie's will cause an earthquake in the French art market," said Herve Aaron, an exhibitor at the biennial. "It's our job to be strong and aggressive."
A further thorn in the side of the organizers of the 40-year-old event was its move two years ago from the opulent Grand Palais to the Carrousel du Louvre, a subterranean sprawl beneath I. M. Pei's glass pyramid. "It's a high-rent shopping mall," complained one dealer who pulled out.
"I think it has a very beautiful ambiance," said Bambi Felberbaum, a collector who traveled from Park Avenue and was taking photographs home for her husband's approval. "It's not easy for me to make purchases without him," she confessed.
Top Parisian decorators were enlisted to design the booths, some of which looked like ancien regime salons. Six were designed by Francois-Joseph Graf, known for his restoration work at Versailles and the redesign of a certain triplex on Park Avenue.
And whose triplex might that be? That of Henry and Marie-Josee Kravis, whose arrival to shop for their 26-room penthouse was awaited with predatory glee.
"Has anyone seen Monsieur Kravis?" was the plaintive cry of countless French dealers envisioning all the museum-quality wares it would take to fill the 68-foot-long ballroom he is converting into a library.
But he had shopped discreetly before the biennial officially opened, darting among recamiers and chenets de fer with Mr. Graf and ultimately buying palace-quality pieces from seven leading dealers. Though no one would say exactly what he bought, Mr. Kravis was said to be keen on a gold-threaded 17th-century tapestry, believed to be a Gobelin. Zut! Dominique Chevalier, the dealer, is committed to selling it as part of a set of four, priced at 14 million francs (about $2.8 million). Close to paradise for Mr. Chevalier, but not quite.
Prices at the show ranged from 500 francs ($100) for a French 19th-century coin to 20 million francs ($4 million) for a platinum-card-busting Picasso painting.
Were objets d'art eligible for frequent flier miles, an awesome number would have been accrued. Trans-Atlantic peregrinations included a set of nine Louis XVI painted landscape wall panels purchased in March at Christie's in New York, then resold in Paris to a mystery client of Mr. Graf's back in the United States. One Louis XV desk that sold for 250,000 (almost $395,000) in London this spring was for sale at $1 million in the biennial.
"Everything I've sold so far has been to Americans," enthused Ariane Dandois, who even sold the floor of her booth, to Juan Pablo Molyneux, the New York designer known for having paid $48,875 for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's tape measure at Sotheby's in April.
Organized by the Syndicat National des Antiquaires, a trade group of 400 elite dealers, most of whom are French, the biennial is highly self-interested. This year, with the help of Loving & Weintraub, a Madison Avenue marketing firm, the syndicat identified 162 "American patrons" who could, in turn, bring along deep-pocketed friends. Among those targeted were Anne Cox Chambers and the Kravises.
"I was very aware that I was being asked to join the Patrons Council as part of a marketing ploy," said Sharon S. Hayslip, an interior designer in Dallas whose clients include Mr. and Mrs. Jerry Jones, the owners of the Dallas Cowboys. "But I have to admit it was fun to be singled out. I hadn't even thought of going before."
But did she buy? "I have several things on reserve," Ms. Hayslip said. "With objects of that caliber you rarely make a split decision." (Another strategy, called "The Biennale Prestige Tour," offered up the visit with Mrs. Chirac and an assortment of dukes, marquises and baronesses for a $5,000 contribution to the American Friends of Blerancourt, a chateau museum founded in 1931 by Anne Morgan, the daughter of the banker J. P. Morgan.)
Pamela Harriman, the United States Ambassador to France, pausing to admire an English 1837 silver chandelier priced at $1.9 million, seemed puzzled by the presence of so many Americans. "I wonder if they're really here to buy," she mused. "Life has changed so much. It's hard to imagine many Americans today having a taste for all this formal French furniture."
One American who loves gilt to the hilt is Tina Turner, who was in town but unable to attend the biennial because of rehearsals for a series of sold-out Paris concerts. Stephen Sills, her New York-based interior designer, said that Ms. Turner's house at Villefranche, in the South of France, already includes a 21-piece suite of gilded Louis Philippe furniture, including a particularly ornate bed whose twin is in the Louvre.
Asked whether he detected a leap in the American taste for French furniture, Herve Aaron said, "I'm not crazily optimistic."
"It's true that most of the major collections in the world of great French art and antiques are in America," he added, "but there's always been a select few of very rich Americans who appreciate the quality of our antiques and can afford them."
He doesn't see that group growing. "America has become a society of sneakers," he said.
Sneakers have their virtues, however. They don't punch holes in Savonnerie carpets. But to judge by the number of Americans spotted in high heels at the biennial, formality isn't entirely passe.

HEADLINE: Banking Bill Retains Consumer Protections

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Sept. 21 editorial "Honesty in Banking" urges the Senate, and me as the Banking Committee chairman, to reconsider any contemplated rollback of the 1991 Truth in Savings Act. I agree with your position and oppose any extreme revisions to this law. 
 Last fall the committee unanimously passed legislation that retains the requirement that banks uniformly advertise an annual percentage yield. The final Senate spending bill does not do away with the disclosures that consumers might use in deciding where to deposit their money. It is to be hoped that the bill will also contain provisions that will protect taxpayers from having to finance another savings and loan bailout and that will improve credit report accuracy and privacy.
In recent years I have fought against high credit-card interest rates, double automatic teller machine surcharges and mortgage scams directed at elderly and working-class homeowners. Maintaining consumer protections and reducing consumer costs have always been a top priority for me, and I am confident that the final package will be true to these goals.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Urges a Tighter U.S. Monetary Policy

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund called today for tightening of American monetary policy to avoid more drastic and disruptive action later.
At the same time, the fund urged Germany to continue interest-rate reductions it has made this year. 
 The call for tighter monetary policy in the United States and some further loosening in Europe came in the lending agency's spring review of the global economy called the World Economic Outlook.
The I.M.F. expects economic growth in the industrial nations of around 2.5 percent a year, with inflation remaining subdued at about the same level until the year 2000. This would leave unemployment in the United States, now 5.1 percent, substantially unchanged, while only a modest cut of perhaps two percentage points was seen in the high rates of European countries, now in the area of 11 percent.
Continuing fast growth was forecast among emerging economies, in the 6 percent annual range this year and next, which would increase the global average to around 4.4 percent a year during the rest of the century. Mexico and Argentina are expected to recover from their financial problems, African growth to accelerate, but expansion to slow in such Asian boom economies as Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia -- where, the I.M.F. said, recent growth rates had been unsustainable, creating a growing inflation risk.
And the I.M.F. said that nations in transition from socialism to capitalism had the potential to reach annual growth rates of roughly 4 percent. Eight countries -- including Poland, the Czech Republic, Albania, Croatia and Slovakia -- were expected to register growth rates of 5 percent or more.
Growth in the United States, after slowing to 2 percent in 1995, rebounded early this year and was forecast to reach 2.4 percent for 1996 and 2.3 percent in 1997.
Though the underlying American inflation rate has remained fairly stable at around 3 percent so far -- indeed, the report was released a day after the Federal Reserve decided there was no reason to raise interest rates for the time being -- the I.M.F. said the recovery now threatened to exceed the level "consistent with low and stable inflation."
"Some firming of monetary policy over the next few months would seem prudent," Michael Mussa, the fund's chief economist, said at a news conference today. He added that American unemployment had now fallen close to a rate at which inflation might start to accelerate, implying that any further reduction would be dangerous. "The risks are on the side of inflation in 1997," Mr. Mussa said.
In Europe, the monetary fund said it expected economic growth to accelerate next year, rising from only 1.6 percent this year in the 15-nation European Union to 2.5 percent in 1997, with German and French growth rates climbing in tandem from 1.3 percent to 2.4 percent.
Still, the I.M.F. suggested that continuing low inflation and a strong currency left the Bundesbank room for further cuts, calling it "still too early to conclude that the recent round of interest-rate reductions has run its course."
While European growth might in time cut a couple of points from the current 11 percent unemployment level, the I.M.F. warned that any further fall risked reigniting inflation unless governments did more to loosen their labor markets.
Japan's modest recovery was expected to accelerate, after two lean years, with growth reaching 3.4 percent in 1996 and 2.7 percent next year. But the I.M.F. warned that the Japanese must aim for a budget surplus to meet the costs of an aging population.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Shakes Off Earlier Fall, Rising Against Yen and Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen and German mark yesterday, shaking off its plunge of a day earlier, when the Federal Reserve disappointed many currency traders by leaving interest rates unchanged.
In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 110.44 yen, up from from 109.00 yen on Tuesday. This was the biggest one-day jump for the dollar against the yen since Aug. 7, when traders responded to the strength of the United States economy and tensions in Korea. 
 The dollar also rose to 1.5156 marks from 1.5011 marks, the biggest one-day jump since April 9. The British pound fell to $1.5610 from $1.5655.
Analysts attributed the dollar's gain against the yen to Japanese investment managers buying higher yielding investments, and the dollars needed to purchase them, to improve balance sheets in time for Monday's halfway mark in that country's fiscal year.
The dollar rose against the mark as the German currency gave way to other European currencies on renewed confidence in plans for a single European currency.
Yesterday's currency moves reversed those of Tuesday, when traders dumped the dollar broadly after the Fed decided it did not need to raise rates now to cool off the economy.
"It's hard for market participants to be bearish on the dollar even if the Fed didn't raise rates, with the mark being weak in Europe and with sizable outflows from Japan," said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, an investment advisory firm in Essex, Conn.
Even as the dollar fell Tuesday, many analysts pointed to the fundamental strength of the currency, especially with the United States economy stronger than other major economies.
Another bit of speculation in the markets has the Fed raising rates at its Nov. 13 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which would give the dollar a boost since higher interest rates make United States assets even more attractive.
"Everyone's of the opinion that the Fed will tighten before the Bank of Japan does," said Martin Ely, head of spot trading at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in London.

HEADLINE: Sales Rate of Existing Houses Dropped Slightly Last Month

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
Sales of used houses fell modestly in August, the National Association of Realtors said today. It was the third straight monthly decline as the housing market showed signs of leveling off.
The board said sales of existing, or used, houses fell one-half of 1 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.13 million. That followed a revised estimate of a two-tenths of 1 percent decline, to 4.15 million, in July and a sharper 2.8 percent drop in June sales. 
 The August drop was not quite so sharp as forecast by Wall Street economists, who had expected sales to fall to 4.09 million a year.
The lobby group's new estimate for July, 4.15 million, was slightly higher than the 4.14 million it announced a month ago. The average price for a house resold in August was $149,900, up from $149,600 in July.
Despite three months of weakening business, August sales of used houses were 2 percent higher than a year earlier, when they were selling at a rate of 4.05 million a year.
The August falloff occurred despite cheaper long-term mortgage rates, and the combination seemed to suggest that some steam was going out of a robust housing market.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, said the average rate for a 30-year mortgage in August was 8 percent, down from 8.25 percent in July.
"The nation's housing market is easing in for a soft landing," said John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. He added that after surging earlier this year, "it's only natural that the market will correct itself."
Sales peaked in May at a record annual rate of 4.28 million.
A waning housing market would be consistent with what appears to be the Federal Reserve's belief -- that the overall economy is slowing. On Tuesday, the Fed decided against raising interest rates, a sign that it believes the economy is likely to cool on its own and keep inflation in check.
During August, sales of used houses fell 9.5 percent in the Northeast, to 570,000 a year, while in the South, the nation's biggest regional housing market, they were down 1.9 percent, to a rate of 1.53 million. In the Midwest, August sales edged up nine-tenths of 1 percent, to a rate of 1.07 million a year, and in the West they increased strongly by 5.6 percent, to 950,000 a year.

HEADLINE: College Tuition Rates Show Steady Growth, Report Says

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
College tuition continues to rise by more than the nation's inflation rate, a situation that is likely to keep pushing more of the cost of college onto the shoulders of students and their families as government support shrinks.
The College Board, in its annual survey made public yesterday, reported that tuition for the current school year increased an average of 6 percent at public four-year colleges and universities and 5 percent at private four-year colleges and universities. 
 The change in who bears the cost of college has been especially pronounced at public colleges and universities, where more than four out of every five students are enrolled.
"We have made a major shift in cost from the taxpayer to the student," said David W. Breneman, an economist and dean of the Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia.
The shift has been steady. In 1992, tuition already accounted for more than a third of the revenue of colleges and universities, up from just a fourth in 1969, according to data compiled by Michael S. McPherson, president of Macalester College in St. Paul, and Morton Owen Schapiro, dean at the University of Southern California. Mr. McPherson said he expected the shift to continue.
"We're going to have to face up to the fact that states are no longer willing or able to continue to provide the across-the-board access that they provided 20 years ago," Mr. McPherson said, adding that the states were the engine in financing higher education.
Even with the higher tuition increases, however, public colleges and universities are still a bargain compared with private ones. In the 1996-97 academic year, tuition and fees for public four-year colleges grew by an average of $155, and reached an average of $2,966. At private four-year colleges, tuition rose an average of $607 to an average of $12,823, the survey showed. Two-year colleges showed average tuition increases of 5 percent, with public colleges rising to $1,394 and private colleges to $6,673.
The College Board survey involved 1,601 public and private four-year institutions with a total full-time enrollment of more than five million undergraduates.
Even as college tuitions have increased, college enrollments have increased to about 15 million, and educators said yesterday that college remained within reach.
"For most Americans, the fact remains that college is still accessible." said Donald M. Stewart, president of the College Board.
At the same time, financial aid is also up, the board said, although most of the growth is in loans rather than grants.
While many elite private colleges and universities now set their tuition at $20,000 and more, the College Board said that more than half of all full-time undergraduates at four-year institutions paid tuition of less than $4,000, and three quarters paid less than $8,000. Fewer than 5 percent pay $20,000 or more.
College graduates continue to earn considerably more than those who have not gone to college.
"College participation rates have been up through this whole period because the returns are so high," said Lawrence Gladieux, executive director for policy analysis at the College Board.
The emphasis on how people benefit from college, rather than on how the nation benefits from a better-educated society, may be one reason taxpayers have been willing to reduce their support for public higher education, some educators say. But Mr. Stewart and others stressed that higher education was an investment for society as a whole.
Private college tuition rates began climbing faster than inflation in 1980, as colleges tried to make up for inflationary increases they faced in the 1970's. But in recent years those increases have slowed.
David L. Warren, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, said this was the eighth consecutive year that the rate of increase in tuition for private colleges and universities had held steady or declined.
"There has been a very tough-minded approach by presidents, faculty and trustees to say what is central and critical to the mission of the institution and what is peripheral and can be eliminated," Mr. Warren said. "Making those choices has allowed the rate of increase in tuition to decline steadily."
The tuition at public universities, which saw smaller increases in the late 1980's than private colleges, began to rise more sharply in the 1990's, and showed double-digit increases in 1991 and 1992 as the economy slowed and states cut their support. Since then, their rate of increase has either equaled or exceeded the private colleges, although the dollar amounts remain smaller.
"The public colleges are struggling to maintain quality through price increases, given the tax revolt they have faced," said Gordon Winston, chairman of the economics department at Williams College and co-director of its project on the economics of higher education.
But state legislatures have begun to encounter resistance to their budget-cutting for higher education. New York State, for example, made sharp cuts in its financing of higher education a year ago, but pared appropriations only slightly this summer. As a result, neither the State University of New York nor the City University of New York raised tuition this fall, after making sizable tuition increases last year.
One small note of comfort to college students and their parents is the continued rise of financial aid.
The College Board said that $50 billion in financial aid was available to students last year, but that most of the $3.3 billion increase this year was in loans rather than grants.
The College Board said that living costs, which at some public institutions can amount to more than the cost of tuition, had also risen this year. Like tuition, living costs rose faster at public colleges than at private ones this year, although on average they are still somewhat lower at public colleges than at private ones.
The average cost of room and board at four-year private colleges rose 4 percent, to $5,361 for the 1996-97 academic year, while the average cost at public four-year colleges rose 6 percent, to $4,152.

Problems may be ahead for the world's vaccine program.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
YOU probably know the pitch: a few pennies collected for the United Nations Children's Fund by trick-or-treaters at Halloween can protect a child against a killer disease. In this case, the claim is only slightly exaggerated. For merely a dollar -- make that $15 if you include delivery to some of the least accessible places on earth -- Unicef can immunize an infant against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles, polio and tuberculosis. No surprise, then, that the World Bank estimates that the Expanded Program of Immunization-Plus, a package with the basic six vaccines, "has the highest cost-effectiveness of any health measure available today."
The catch is that the wide diffusion of vaccines depends on multitier pricing in which the wealthy markets bear the enormous development costs while poor markets cover only their share of the manufacturing costs. The "State of the World's Vaccines and Immunization," a largely celebratory report issued yesterday by Unicef and the World Health Organization, hints at serious political and economic problems ahead in keeping Robin Hood in charge of the game. 
 The focused immunization effort by W.H.O. and Unicef, begun in 1974, is a roaring success. Vaccination coverage against the six target diseases has risen from 5 percent of the world's newborns to 80 percent today, cutting childhood deaths by about three million a year. Polio will probably follow the way of smallpox into extinction within a decade, relieving developed countries of the need to spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually to immunize their own young.
So, too, is the system for keeping costs manageable in the third world. Vaccines are bought in bulk from private manufacturers at rock-bottom prices. A "cold chain" delivery network, developed over the years by Unicef and W.H.O. in coordination with local authorities, maintains vaccine quality with minimal use of high-priced foreign personnel.
But strains are showing. Vaccine sales at high markups in rich countries, needed to sustain variable-cost pricing in poor ones, is a continuing source of political tension. The issue made headlines in 1993 when President Clinton attacked discriminatory pricing against America, proposing as a remedy that the Federal Government act as a monopoly buyer of basic vaccines for the nation. And the new report suggests that such strains will grow.
For one thing, some 14 vaccines have entered the market since 1980 and dozens more are in the pipeline. Research costs, the report estimates, are running from $50 million to $200 million for every vaccine. And while most of the new vaccines are likely to prove cost-effective when the development outlays are averaged among wealthy and needy populations, nobody is rushing forward to foot the overhead.
"We've built up the expectation that antibiotics are expensive and vaccines are cheap," said Amy Batson, a senior official at W.H.O. "It's easy to justify high prices for medicines that save people, once they have a disease. It's a lot harder to underwrite the costs of prevention."
For another, ownership of the "intellectual property" in vaccines is growing more tangled as the research effort spreads from the old-line pharmaceutical houses to universities and private labs. This complicates the process of negotiating low or zero-royalty charges on behalf of customers who cannot possibly afford more than pennies a dose.
Perhaps most important, the lines between rich and poor consumers are becoming blurred. Rapidly growing economies like China and Brazil have far greater capacity to absorb the overhead in creating vaccines than subsistence economies like Bhutan and Somalia. One could also argue -- as President Clinton, in effect, did -- that poor Americans have a greater moral claim to vaccines at cost than, say, middle-class citizens of Brazil.
W.H.O. and Unicef offer a two-pronged fix. They want to divide the countries they now serve into four categories ranging from Laos and Mozambique, which will be asked to pay only a token share of vaccine costs, to Turkey and Malaysia, which will be asked to bear a substantial portion, to Russia and Mexico, which "would be left to their own devices."
Less specifically, they want decision-makers to get more serious about priorities. Vaccines that can be manufactured cheaply (like the yellow fever vaccine) should be delivered where they are needed as quickly as possible. But costs must be weighed against benefits for more expensive vaccines, like the one against Hib bacterial meningitis now widely used in the industrial countries.
Walter Vandersmissen, a spokesman for SmithKline Beecham in Belgium, agrees "as a matter of global principle" that most of the overhead in vaccine development should be assigned to consumers with deep pockets. But vaccine manufacturers are uneasy about opening their pricing policies to public debate, the likely consequence as the armory against infectious diseases expands along with costs and life-death choices became stark. "Everyone likes multitier pricing as long as the price they pay is the lowest," Mr. Vandersmissen said.

HEADLINE: New U.S. Bonds Could Prove To Be Tax Trap for Unwary

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
What could be more enticing to the long-term investor than a promise to protect returns from inflation's corrosive effect?
But the inflation-proof Government bonds announced today by President Clinton do not banish risk so much as exchange one kind of risk for another, experts say. As a result, they are likely to appeal mainly to highly conservative investors and could even prove a tax trap for the unwary. 
 "To herald them as a great investment for education and retirement may be a bit misleading," contended John R. Ziegelbauer, a senior manager at Grant Thornton, the accounting firm. "If you're going long term, you really should look for a mix of stocks and bonds."
Still, the novel securities will fill an important niche for both individual and institutional investors, analysts said. They will also benefit the Government -- and thereby taxpayers. The Treasury will get an additional tool for managing its huge debt that could save it money as long as inflation remains under control, while the Federal Reserve will get a pure gauge of inflation expectations that will aid its formulation of monetary policy.
Every investment represents a balancing of acceptable risk and potential rewards. Stocks go up and down by the minute and are worth whatever they will fetch when you want to sell. Bonds, which also fluctuate in price, generally give a lower rate of return over time. And while that rate is guaranteed in dollars, an unanticipated rise in inflation would mean that these dollars would not buy as much as the investor had hoped.
The trade-off for buyers of the inflation-proof bonds is that they accept an even lower stated rate of return in exchange for a guarantee that their buying power will not be diminished by inflation alone. Following up the May announcement of its intention to issue bonds that protect buyers from inflation, the Treasury said today that it would conduct its first auction in January and would offer the securities quarterly.
Yields will be determined by those bidding in the market. In Canada, Britain and other countries that have offered such bonds the real interest rate -- that is, the rate after inflation -- has fluctuated between 3 and 5 percent, experts said.
Initially, the Treasury will sell 10-year notes but other, so far unspecified, maturities will be added within a year. The amount will not be set until the close to the auction day but the Government pledged to sell enough to support a liquid trading market. Some private specialists believe the Government eventually hopes to have 15 percent of its roughly $5 trillion debt in what it calls "inflation protection" bonds. One official noted today that even 2 percent of today's debt would mean the Government would have to sell $100 billion worth.
From various choices, the Treasury decided to structure the securities like those that Canada began issuing in December 1991. These are so-called bullet instruments, whose principal amount is adjusted for inflation while the interest rate remains fixed.
Inflation will be measured by the most popular yardstick -- the Consumer Price Index for urban areas -- without any adjustment for recurring seasonal variation. There will also be a lag so that, for example, the rate to be applied on Dec. 1 is the C.P.I. for September.
The security is tailored with pension funds and Wall Street's traders particularly in mind.
"We think they work well," said Dan Bernstein, director of research at Bridgewater Associates, a Wilton, Conn., firm with experience in indexed Canadian bonds and whose pension fund clients will find their risk of mismatched assets and liabilities "completely erased."
Treasury officials said they delayed the first auction to give Wall Street time to develop a market for stripped versions of the securities, which will resemble today's zero- coupon bonds. They will be split into their principal and interest components and marketed separately. Money managers are already creating mutual funds based on inflation-proof securities.
The officials would not say whether the second maturity to be offered would be shorter or longer than 10 years. Private analysts predicted it would be a two-to-five-year issue, which they said would have greatest appeal for individual investors. A 30-year issue, by contrast, is most attractive to institutions.
The bonds will be sold in denominations as low as $1,000, mostly for 401(k)'s and other tax-deferred accounts, but others who bid for them were cautioned about adverse tax consequences should inflation surge.
With the new bonds paying the real part of their interest on a semiannual basis -- the inflation adjustment comes only at maturity -- it is possible that the bond will not generate enough cash in a given year to cover the tax liability it creates.
But that only happens at sharply higher inflation rates, Barbara J. Moore, a managing director of the SEI Corporation in New York, said. The break-even inflation rate for a taxpayer in the 28 percent bracket is 8.5 percent.
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, promptly denounced the Administration for what he said was a failure to consult Congress about inflation-proof bonds. Mr. Archer argued that the bonds would create a "new level of uncertainty" about budget projections and asked the Administration to defer implementation.
A Treasury spokesman, Howard Schloss, said that Treasury officials had repeatedly discussed inflation-protected bonds with the Ways and Means Committee staff since April.
The Administration also announced today that it will offer by January 1998 a new inflation-protected savings bond to be sold in denominations as low as $50.
It also said it would propose legislation to expand the tax-exempt use of savings bonds to include vocational and other schools not now qualified and to eliminate the current requirement that buyers of bonds for this purpose be at least 24 years old.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Is Becoming 'National Spokesman' on Immigration

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Having received widespread attention for his outspoken positions in favor of immigration and against parts of the new Federal welfare law, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has recently found a new avocation: becoming what an aide calls the "national spokesman" for these issues at forums around the country.
In the last few months, the Mayor has received more than 100 invitations to speak on these topics, said his communications director, Cristyne F. Lategano. Most have been turned down, but he has accepted at least three, including a speech he gave earlier this month at the Georgetown University Law School in Washington, where he announced plans to file suit against the Federal Government over part of the welfare law. 
 On Monday, he will deliver the keynote address at a conference on "The New Immigrants" at the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. Next month, he is scheduled to give a similar speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. (He will not receive a speaking fee for the appearances.)
The Mayor has also made several nationally televised appearances on the subjects.
The burst of speaking trips represents an unusual departure for a mayor who almost never leaves New York City, even for a vacation. But he has warmed to his new-found role, which allows him to stress his distance from the right wing of the Republican Party -- still a political anathema in the city -- while becoming one of the party's more visible moderates.
"When he gets these invitations, what they tell us is that he's really become the national spokesman for these issues, the leader on these issues," Ms. Lategano said. "He views it as his responsibility to spread the word and go to other parts of the country to tell them firsthand the devastating effects of this anti-immigrant legislation."
Mr. Giuliani misses few opportunities to make these points at home as well, delivering similar speeches on Tuesday to the Manhattan Institute and yesterday to St. Francis College in Brooklyn. His remarks generally follow the same pattern: praising the industry and innovation of immigrants while criticizing the welfare law and other proposals that restrict benefits to legal and illegal aliens.
On welfare, he speaks highly of almost every major provision in the welfare law -- touting the workfare program he has built, the country's largest -- but attacks the law as an unfinanced mandate, saying it fails to provide enough money to cities and states.
"I'm a very big supporter of immigration because I think immigration is the principle that has been at the core of New York City's success for 200 years," Mr. Giuliani said yesterday, speaking to about 200 students and others at St. Francis, a small Catholic college in downtown Brooklyn. "It's the reason why this city is the wealthiest city in America, the reason why this city is the best-known city in the world. And there's the reason why this city constantly finds ways of renewing itself."
By cutting off food stamps and other benefits for legal and illegal immigrants, Mr. Giuliani said, the welfare law is hurting a group of people who actually work and own businesses in greater proportion than American citizens. This week, under orders from the state, the city began dropping some legal immigrants from the food stamps program, citing the new law.
"The Federal Government is saying, 'Come in, we'll take your tax dollars, but then if you get in trouble, and the job you thought you had, you lose, or you get sick, we're not going to give you anything,' " he said. "You, however, just stay here, and what's the city and the state of New York going to have to do about it? They're going to have to pay for it."
On Tuesday, speaking to members of the Manhattan Institute at the staid Union League Club, Mr. Giuliani, in response to a question from the audience, made a joke about the English-speaking deficiencies of New York City taxicab drivers but then quickly launched into his defense of immigrants. "I am the biggest supporter of immigrants left in the United States of America," he told the crowd, which did not applaud that particular part of his remarks.
Those who have invited Mr. Giuliani to speak say they find it remarkable that a Republican mayor is making such a strong case in favor of further immigration, particularly when the opposite sentiment is so frequently heard in party circles.
"We thought at a time in which people were kind of skeptical about immigration, we wanted to hear from someone who was going to speak enthusiastically about the contributions of people from all over the world to America," said Robert Kudrle, professor of public affairs at the Humphrey Institute and one of the organizers of next week's conference, which coincides with the Year of the Swedish Immigrant celebration at the university. "Mr. Giuliani has been celebrating immigration, and I guess it makes sense for a mayor of New York to do that."
Frank J. Macchiarola, president of St. Francis College, said that as a "good Democrat," he would not normally be a political supporter of Mayor Giuliani. But he said Mr. Giuliani's positions resonated well with his student body of 2,000, which is 20 percent foreign born.
"Let's give credit here where it's due," said Mr. Macchiarola, a former city schools chancellor. "In large measure, he has been outstanding in that regard, and it demonstrates a real understanding of what this city is all about."
On his radio programs and at his "town meetings," the Mayor has often received questions that are critical of immigrants, and he has wondered aloud whether his position represents "political suicide" locally. But having fallen from grace with the national Republican Party for endorsing former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat, in 1994 and failing to endorse Bob Dole, a fellow Republican, so far this year for President, Mr. Giuliani has suddenly found a new doorway onto the national stage.
"He's the Mayor of a large city that serves as the economic engine of the country," said Ms. Lategano, denying that any political calculation was involved. "When he sees the value and importance of an issue like this, he believes it's going to benefit not only New York City but the entire country if there's an understanding of that issue."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE PLAYERS;
For Its Stretch Drive, Dole Campaign Turns to a Turnaround Artist

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25

 BODY:
The G. D. Searle Company was a sluggish purveyor of Metamucil in an otherwise booming drug industry when Donald H. Rumsfeld became its chairman in 1977. By the time he left in 1985, its stock had quintupled. He repeated the trick at General Instruments Inc., a slumbering electronics business whose stock leapt to $51 from $15 a share during his stint there in the early 1990's.
Mr. Rumsfeld, in short, is a proven turnaround artist. 
 He says that is unrelated to his recent ascension to national chairman of Dole for President Inc., a struggling concern in which even some Republicans place little stock.
"I am a nonexecutive chairman," Mr. Rumsfeld said in an interview. "Scott Reed is the executive of this campaign, and every piece of it operationally reports to him. I have no line operating functions."
Nor does he need any. At 64, Mr. Rumsfeld is the campaign's eminence grise: a former fighter pilot, Congressman, Cabinet member, White House chief of staff, Secretary of Defense, diplomat, corporate czar and onetime Presidential aspirant who is Mr. Dole's peer and chief troubleshooter.
"He's strategic, he's substantive, and he's grown up," said Kenneth Duberstein, President Reagan's former chief of staff. "He makes the trains run on time."
He also is demanding, blunt-spoken in private and more than a little driven. He has often said he finds crises invigorating rather than daunting. Fortune magazine named him one of the nation's toughest corporate bosses in 1980; he addressed a cash crisis at General Instruments, a multibillion-dollar corporation, by shrinking its headquarters staff to 23, including clerks and a temp.
Mr. Rumsfeld says somewhat vaguely that his new job is "to do things, to look at things and give my thoughts" whenever Mr. Dole or Mr. Reed requests them. Others say that not only means assisting in daily organization and policy decisions but helping shape whatever long-term strategy can be executed in the six weeks of politicking left.
"The most important thing is what Dole's talking about on a daily basis," one campaign official said. "That's Rumsfeld's franchise."
His impact is hard to measure. Mr. Dole has nudged slightly upward in some voter-preference polls since Mr. Rumsfeld took on his new job on Aug. 27, and he has avoided any major gaffes. But both were to be expected as Mr. Dole gained experience and voters began to pay attention to the race.
Mr. Rumsfeld says his chief value is bringing an outsider's perspective to a Washington campaign.
"I think like a businessman, a noninside-the-Beltway person. And I have the kinds of passions and concerns and views that are very strongly held from having dealt with the Government," he said.
Mr. Rumsfeld joined the campaign in June as a senior policy adviser, helping to flesh out Mr. Dole's positions. He expected the job to take a couple of days a week.
He was wrong. As it became apparent that Mr. Dole needed bold proposals to define his candidacy, policy became the keystone of the campaign's strategy, and Mr. Rumsfeld's visits turned into a six-day-a-week job.
One obvious product of that was Mr. Dole's signature issue, his proposed economic package with its 15 percent cut in income taxes and other breaks for families and investors. Mr. Rumsfeld said he and Mr. Weber were "intimately involved" in that process, mostly by overseeing the experts who prepared a menu of economic proposals for Mr. Dole.
Donald Rumsfeld's resume is one long, virtually uninterrupted climb upward.
Mr. Rumsfeld -- friends call him Rummy -- was born in 1932 in Evanston, Ill. He was an Eagle Scout. He wrestled and played football in high school and later at Princeton University. He married his high-school sweetheart. In 1954, he joined the Navy, became a jet-fighter pilot and All Navy wrestling champion, and moved to Washington after his discharge in 1957.
Mr. Rumsfeld later returned to Chicago, decided in 1961 to run for the House, and won overwhelmingly in a campaign that left experts marveling over its grass-roots fervor. Back in Washington, he drew Suite 241 in the Cannon House Office Building; his neighbor in 243, Representative Bob Dole, became a family friend. So did Representative Gerald R. Ford of Michigan.
Mr. Rumsfeld quit Congress in 1969 to run what seemed a Nixon Administration backwater, an anti-poverty agency called the Office of Economic Opportunity. His deft performance, in which he shrank the popular agency without dismembering it, won him a job as counselor to Mr. Nixon and later as United States Ambassador to NATO.
When Watergate washed Mr. Nixon from office in 1974, Mr. Rumsfeld was overseas, isolated from its taint. The new President Ford brought him home, first as his chief of staff and then as Secretary of Defense. Newspapers called him the Republican Party's hottest ticket, a sure-fire Presidential prospect.
Instead, Mr. Ford lost the 1976 Presidential campaign, and Mr. Rumsfeld took a U-turn to private business at Searle. "I could very well have stayed around, been a butterfly waiting to land," he said earlier this month. "But I decided that isn't how I wanted to spend my life."
At Searle, he slashed headquarters jobs, sold off money-losing divisions and focused on consumer products and drug research, then the company's weak spot. The firm rebounded, and the Monsanto Company bought Searle in 1985 in part on the strength of its rebuilt pharmaceutical business.
After five years as an investor and consultant, he moved to General Instrument, this time concentrating the company's resources on cable and high-definition television. When the privately owned firm went public in 1993, Mr. Rumsfeld reaped $23 million from stock sales.
Most recently he was chairman of the board of Rand Corporation, the private, nonpartisan research organization, from which he has taken a leave of absence.
In 1988, Mr. Rumsfeld considered making his own run for the Republican Presidential nomination but dropped the effort, in part because of the money-raising that an all-out campaign demanded.
That campaign may have been hopeless. Mr. Rumsfeld says he does not feel that way about Mr. Dole's candidacy. In 1976, he says, he saw another Republican Presidential candidate -- his boss, Gerald Ford -- make up a 15-point deficit in a matter of weeks, only to lose to Jimmy Carter by a tiny fraction of the vote.
"The President is known to the American people; they're aware of him," he said. "The other candidate is not yet known to them, or to the extent he's known at all, it's as a senator. This campaign is just beginning."
