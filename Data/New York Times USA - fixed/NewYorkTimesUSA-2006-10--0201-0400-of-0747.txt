HEADLINE: The Payoff and Perils In 'Set It and Forget It' 

BYLINE: By JAMES PETHOKOUKIS

 BODY:
INVESTING is one part of life in which the ancient admonition ''everything in moderation'' rings true. Sound financial advice can mutate when taken to extremes. For example, keeping close track of your portfolio is a smart idea. Yet you don't want to turn into an obsessive day trader, constantly churning shares for will-o'-the-wisp reasons like a Jim Cramer sound bite on CNBC or an anonymous message-board posting. Save that sort of behavior for your fantasy football league.
 But there is another example of simple advice that can become dangerously simplistic: Buy mutual funds that you can hold onto for a lifetime. A flock of such funds, known as target-date retirement or ''life cycle'' funds, are on the market these days.
To invest in one of them, you choose an expected retirement year and pick a fund that is aimed at that approximate date. A 30-year-old might pick the Fidelity Freedom 2045 fund, while a 50-year-old might choose the Vanguard Target Retirement 2020 fund. Typically, as the funds approach their target dates, the managers gradually adjust their asset allocations away from stock funds and more toward bond funds to make the portfolios more conservative. And if a particular sector becomes underweighted or overweighted, the manager automatically rebalances the fund. 
 On the surface, at least, investing doesn't come much easier, unless you hire a personal pro to do everything for you. Little wonder that target-date funds have been nicknamed ''set it and forget it'' funds -- though you won't find that kind of sloganeering in mutual-fund company ads. 
 ''Personally, I love the terminology,'' said Jerome Clark, who manages target funds for T. Rowe Price, based in Baltimore, ''but my legal department doesn't like it. Really, though, the beauty of these funds is they relieve the typical investor who doesn't want to spend a lot of time following his portfolio of the burden of reallocation and keeping up with the market. No fund is ever going to be completely hands-off, but these are about as close as you are going to get.''
 Judging by the public's response to these funds, many investors are happy to be relieved of the ''burdens'' of fund ownership. Assets of life-cycle funds surged nearly 70 percent in 2005, to $70 billion, according to the Investment Company Institute in Washington. And in the first half of this year, according to Financial Research in Boston, life-cycle funds accounted for 2 of the 10 best-selling categories of funds. Among the companies now offering these funds, with dates that extend to 2045 or 2050, are AllianceBernstein Investments, American Century Investments, Fidelity Investments, Putnam Investments, Charles Schwab, the T. Rowe Price Group and the Vanguard Group. 
 If you don't find any target-date retirement funds in your company's 401(k) plan, you may well start seeing them soon. The Pension Protection Act of 2006, signed by President Bush in August, encourages companies to automatically enroll workers in retirement plans. And for those workers who don't pick an investment option, target-date funds are likely to serve as the default investment, rather than the low-return money-market or stable-value choices of the past. Already, nearly half of companies offer these funds in their plans, according to a national survey completed in June and released last month by Wells Fargo's employee benefits consulting group. 
 Yet for all the apparent simplicity and autopilot ease of target-date funds, investing in them does have its complexities. That's why fund company legal departments may well be a bit squeamish about all this ''set it and forget it'' talk. For starters, life-cycle funds are not nearly as cookie-cutter as index funds, in which differences can often be measured in a few hundredths of a percentage point. 
 ''Investors need to do some due diligence before they buy,'' said Greg Carlson, an analyst with Morningstar in Chicago. ''There can be big differences in terms of cost, asset allocation and general quality of offerings.'' 
 At the end of August, for instance, the Vanguard Target Retirement 2010 fund had an expense ratio of 0.21 percent and had 56.5 percent of its assets in various Vanguard equity index funds. The T. Rowe Price Retirement 2010 fund, by contrast, had a 0.65 percent expense ratio and 63.4 percent of its assets in stock funds at the end of June. Then there's the Fidelity Freedom 2010 fund, with a more conservative allocation of 48.1 percent of its assets to stock funds at the end of June. 
 Knowing the asset allocation is crucial for a number of reasons. Although target funds are often promoted as single-fund solutions, ''you may have other assets that need to be accounted for,'' says Ellen Rinaldi, who runs Vanguard's investment counseling and research program.
 Say you are going to retire in 2020 and own the Vanguard Target Retirement 2020, which is 72.4 percent in stocks. But if you also own an equal amount of the Vanguard Pacific Stock Index fund -- also owned by the 2020 fund -- then your overall portfolio may be too heavily invested in stocks, particularly foreign stocks. Many investors who are less than 15 years from retirement may not be comfortable with such a potentially volatile combination.
 But the asset-allocation differences go beyond volatility. There has been a growing acceptance in money-management circles -- particularly by Fidelity and Vanguard -- that portfolios need to contain a substantial proportion of stocks or stock funds in them to beat inflation -- even as investors approach or reach retirement. Portfolios with too many bonds or money market instruments may simply evaporate as life spans lengthen and assets are drawn down. Charles Schwab, for instance, has committed to keeping at least 60 percent of its life-cycle assets in stock funds until the target dates. After that, Schwab gradually shifts that allocation to bonds for the next 20 years, until the fund is 80 percent in fixed income. 
 ''The old saw used to be that 100 minus your age was a good starting point'' for stock allocations, ''and it makes some basic sense,'' said Jeff Mortimer, who runs the target funds at Schwab in San Francisco. ''But while that may hold true for a 20-year-old and an 80-year-old, it gets a bit muddled in the middle.''
 Even if two funds have a similar equity allocation, there may be big sector differences underneath. Mixes of large-cap, small-cap, growth, value and international funds can vary greatly and have a big impact on performance. And while some funds will more or less stick to pre-set recipes, others, like T. Rowe Price's, will vary the portions according to market conditions.
 Many of these funds have short track records. But Mark Labovitz, a Lipper research analyst in Denver, decided to work around that limitation by running simulations of the life-cycle funds of AllianceBernstein, Fidelity, Vanguard and T. Rowe Price, using the last 40 years of stock-return data. 
 ''It's what I call, tongue-in-cheek, my bake-off,'' Mr. Labovitz said. 
 After running the numbers, he found that AllianceBernstein was the overall leader in terms of both raw and risk-adjusted returns. A big key to its outperformance was that it was the only one of the four that used real estate investment trusts in its allocation strategy. Yet he is quick to add that ''market conditions over the next 40 years may not be like those over the past 40.'' So REIT's are no magic bullet.
 Both the markets and the mutual funds keep changing. Investors are advised to monitor both of them. 
 ''I have a big problem with that 'set it and forget it' mentality,'' said Roy Weitz, editor of the always-skeptical FundAlarm Web site. ''These funds have different asset allocations, so some will be winners and some will be losers -- and the difference could mean retiring or not being able to retire at all.''
 FOR investors who prefer the ''no fuss, no muss'' aspect of target-date funds, Mr. Weitz offered two pieces of advice. First, consider investing in a life-cycle ''barbell.'' That means buying at least two life-cycle funds from different fund families -- even if they have the same target date -- with one fund being aggressive and the other more conservative. Second, review your retirement goals from time to time and compare them to how much money you've accumulated. If it looks as if you'll fall short, you should start contributing more money or adjusting your holdings. 
 Mr. Weitz would still prefer that people pick their own funds or have an adviser do it for them. But ''as a default investment,'' he said, ''you could do a lot worse than life-cycle funds.''

HEADLINE: The Big-Sky Dem

BYLINE: By Mark Sundeen. 
Mark Sundeen has written for Outside and National Geographic Adventure. This is his first article for the magazine.

 BODY:
It's fun being governor of Montana. Just watch Brian Schweitzer bouncing around the streets of Helena in the passenger seat of the state's official S.U.V., fumbling with wires, trying to stick the flashing police light on the roof. When he spots some legislators on the sidewalk, he blasts them with the siren, then summons them by name on the loudspeaker. The men jump, and the governor tumbles out of the car, doubled in laughter, giving everyone a bear hug or a high-five or a soft slap on the cheek. Schweitzer, a Democrat in his first term, marches into a barroom in blue jeans and cowboy boots and a beaded bolo tie, and his border collie, Jag, leaps out of the vehicle and follows him in. The governor throws back a few pints of the local brew and introduces himself to everyone in the place, down to the servers and a small girl stuck there with her parents. He takes time from the backslapping to poach cubes of cheese from the snack platter and sneak them to the girl, who is now chasing his dog around the bar. ''This is how you make friends with Jag,'' he advises her. ''Just hold it in your hand and let him take it.'' 
As soon as Schweitzer was elected in 2004 -- the same night that George W. Bush carried Montana by 20 percentage points -- pundits began declaring him the future of the Democratic Party. Never mind that it was his first elected office: the 51-year-old farmer and irrigation contractor had folksy charm and true-grit swagger. He shot guns, rode horses, took his dog to work and decimated his opponents with off-the-cuff one-liners heavy on the bull-and-horse metaphors. He didn't act like a Democrat, in other words, and to many Democrats, reeling from consecutive losses to Bush, that seemed like a pretty good thing.
 Schweitzer's grandparents were homesteaders who immigrated to Montana from Ireland and Germany. His parents were ranchers who never completed high school. And until 2000, Schweitzer and his wife, Nancy, were farming in Whitefish and raising their three children. And then, despite the fact that he was a virtual unknown in politics, Schweitzer began a quixotic bid to oust Conrad Burns, a two-term incumbent Republican senator. To the surprise of Montana's political class, he came within four percentage points of succeeding. Almost immediately, he began campaigning for what would be an open governor's seat. Even after choosing a Republican as his running mate, he thumped his primary opponent by a 52-point margin, then won the general election by four points.
 Within months of his election, bloggers were clamoring for a presidential run, and his popularity transcended the wonk journals to include coronation as ''Hot Governor'' by Rolling Stone magazine, while ''60 Minutes'' called him the Coal Cowboy. On camera he persuaded Lesley Stahl to take a whiff from a vial of diesel fuel synthesized from coal -- a product that Schweitzer claims will not only fill Montana's coffers but also help end the nation's dependence on foreign oil peddled by ''sheiks, rats, crooks, dictators.''
 Schweitzer's ''Montana miracle,'' in which Democrats took back the governor's seat after 16 years and ended 12 years of Republican majorities in both state chambers, has been cited as evidence that the Republican bastions in the Western states are losing ground to a new, Democratic brand of libertarian-tinged prairie populism. No fewer than four recent books by Democratic strategists have mentioned Schweitzer as the kind of guy Democrats need to win back rural America. A fifth book, Tom Schaller's ''Whistling Past Dixie,'' published earlier this month, also singles out Schweitzer and makes the previously heretical claim that the Democrats' future lies in ignoring the South and embracing the West and Midwest, where voters are less evangelical and more independent.
 ''He's one of the new stars in the party,'' Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, chairman of the Democratic Governors' Association, told me recently. ''We're highlighting him wherever we can.'' Indeed, just 54 days into his term, Schweitzer was chosen to deliver the Democrats' weekly radio address, and he has been attracting notice from the party faithful ever since -- like when he compared the president to a shifty cattle auctioneer hawking lousy bulls to dubious ranchers. 
 Six-foot-two and a beefy 205 pounds, Schweitzer has seized the heartland imagery generally monopolized by Republicans. ''Schweitzer is the antithesis of the Democrat stereotype,'' Markos Moulitsas Zuniga, of dailykos.com, the partisan Democratic blog, told me. ''Too many Democrats look like targets for the school bully. Schweitzer is a tough guy. And people like guys who will bar-fight their way across a state.''
 Schweitzer veers right on many economic and social issues: he opposes gun control, favors the death penalty and preaches about lowering taxes and balancing budgets. At the same time, he leans left on some issues that matter to progressives: championing energy conservation and environmental regulation, opposing governmental restrictions on abortion and criticizing free-trade deals. ''He's as much a prairie centrist as he is a prairie populist,'' Bruce Reed of the Democratic Leadership Council told me. Schweitzer has the ability to reduce a complicated issue to a few sharp lines, reframing it with themes of patriotism and underdog know-how. ''I was a critic of Nafta, I was a critic of Cafta and I'll be a critic of Shafta,'' he says of free-trade agreements, long the hobgoblin of even the most articulate liberal politicians. ''Why is it that America supposedly creates the best businessmen in the world, but when we go to the table with the third world, we come away losers?'' 
 The Democrats' enthusiasm for their new hero seemed to overlook the fact that the governor of a state as sparsely populated as Montana simply does not wield a lot of national clout. Schweitzer governs fewer than a million people, in a state with a single Congressional representative, only three electoral votes and a Legislature that meets for just 90 days, every other year. Indeed, Schweitzer's national celebrity has less to do with the way he has governed and more to do with Democrats' perception -- or their hope -- that he is leading a Western resurgence.
 The elections next month will test that theory. Schweitzer has been campaigning for the two Western Democrats best poised to replace powerful Republicans. In Montana, a populist farmer named Jon Tester is posing a serious challenge to Senator Conrad Burns, whose close ties to the lobbyist Jack Abramoff have made him an attractive target for Democrats trying to paint the Republicans as corrupt insiders. A Tester victory would solidify Montana as a Democratic stronghold, marking the first time since 1989 that the state's two senators and governor were all Democrats. (Montana's other senator, Max Baucus, a Democrat, has held his seat since 1978.) In Colorado, meanwhile, Schweitzer has been stumping for Bill Ritter, the former Denver district attorney, who grew up on a farm with 11 brothers and sisters, began working construction at age 14 and is now running for governor. A Ritter win would complete what Schweitzer calls a ''blue bridge from Alberta to Mexico,'' a string of Democratic governorships stretching across Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona -- states that all broke for Bush in 2004.
 Some of this has to do with demographics. In the last three decades, professional and service jobs have boomed in the Rocky Mountain states, and farming and mining jobs have not; those two sectors, once the mainstay of the region, now make up just 5 percent of all jobs. In Nevada, Arizona and Colorado, a sharp rise in the Hispanic population in the last decade may also have helped tilt the voting base to the left. But Governor Schweitzer says he believes that his success points to something more significant. ''Is it that the population in the West is trending toward the traditional Democratic Party?'' Schweitzer asked. ''Or is it possible that some leaders in the Rocky Mountains are on the vanguard of realigning what the Democrats stand for?''
 The Interior West has long been seen by Democrats on election night as simply a disheartening wall of big red blocks. Idaho, Utah and Wyoming haven't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and Montana, Colorado and Arizona have all gone Republican in 9 of the last 10 presidential elections. But below the surface, the map of the West is slowly becoming a little less red and a little more blue. In 2000, Democrats had not a single governor in the interior West states; now they have four. Democrats have gradually been picking up House seats, too. In 1996, they won 4 of 24 House seats in the region. But they've managed to pick up 1 or 2 seats in each of the last four elections and have now clawed their way up to 8 of 28. In 2004, the party's only bright spot besides Montana was Colorado, where Ken Salazar won a Republican Senate seat; his brother, John, picked up a House seat; and the Democrats took control of both state chambers.
 ''The pan-Western states -- in an arc from Ohio, west to Montana and south to Arizona -- are where the low-hanging and most-ripe-for-the-plucking electoral fruit for Democrats is to be found,'' writes Tom Schaller in ''Whistling Past Dixie.'' The midterm election outlook seems to support Schaller's thesis. None of the region's eight Democratic representatives -- the so-called Coyote Caucus -- are considered at serious risk in 2006. But 10 of the 20 Republican-held seats are included in the list of 56 potential Democratic pickups compiled by Larry Sabato at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. The Democratic Senate candidate in Arizona is putting up a surprising fight against the Republican incumbent, and the race for Nevada governor, an open seat vacated by a Republican, is listed by the Cook Report, an influential Washington political newsletter, as a tossup.
 Local Democrats portray this trend as a grass-roots, homegrown phenomenon. ''These advances were not the results of any national organization,'' Jim Farrell, executive director of the Montana Democratic Party, told me, ''but of the emergence of great local leadership like Schweitzer and Salazar. The D.S.C.C.'' -- the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, led by Charles Schumer of New York -- ''and other national groups have recognized the potential for gain, but they're chasing after a train that began rolling in the last two cycles here in the West.''
 It would seem to be true that Democrats in Washington long ignored the mountain states. As Pat Williams, a Montana Democrat who served in the House from 1979 to 1996, told me, ''In 2000 you literally couldn't get an Al Gore button in Montana.'' But in recent years, the national Democratic Party has made some small but significant organizational shifts to increase the West's political brawn. In August, the Democratic National Committee inserted a Nevada caucus into the 2008 presidential primary schedule, between Iowa and New Hampshire, in recognition that the Southwest is the nation's fastest-growing region. The West has also gained influence through the elevation of Senator Harry Reid, a pro-gun, pro-life Nevada Mormon, to Senate minority leader. Democrats have chosen Denver as one of two finalists to be host of their 2008 convention (the other is New York). If Denver is selected, it will mark the first time in a century that Democrats have held a convention in the interior West. The D.N.C. has hired as its Northwest political director Brad Martin, who as executive director of the Montana Democratic Party oversaw its 2004 gains, and Howard Dean has dispatched more than 30 staff members to the Western states as part of his ''50-state strategy.''
 Still, Democrats hasten to assure the region's notoriously prickly and independent voters that the national party's new Western focus doesn't mean that Washington will exercise any control over candidates in the region. ''We're not trying to be a top-down organization like the Republicans,'' says Karen Finney, spokeswoman of the D.N.C. In the West, of course, being seen as refusing to take orders is a way to demonstrate your frontier spirit. Williams offers this advice to any Western candidate wondering whether to employ a regional strategy: ''If it doesn't exist, create it. And then be against it.''
 As fertile as the West may seem for Democrats, some in the party remain skeptical that it matters much. ''The problem with the Democrats is that they can't count,'' Dave (Mudcat) Saunders, a Democratic campaign strategist, told me. Saunders's book, ''Foxes in the Henhouse,'' argues that the party would be wrong to focus on the West and ignore the South. He notes that 30 percent of the country's electoral votes come from the South, and that by 2025 that percentage will be 40. ''Georgia and Florida have as many votes as all the West put together,'' Saunders points out. 
 Montana Republicans don't concede that the 2004 results show a Democratic trend in Montana -- much less the rest of the West. Roy Brown, the leader of the Republican caucus in the statehouse, says that the Democrats' pickup of seats in the Legislature was not due to a sea change in the electorate but a result of gerrymandering perpetrated by a Montana Supreme Court that is ''in bed with the Democrats.'' Although Montana does not require voters to identify party affiliation, Brown estimates that 40 percent are Republicans, 35 percent are Democrats and 25 percent are independents. He concedes that in recent years the independents have been leaning toward the Democrats, but he says that's not a consequence of a true shift in voter attitudes but a result of a ''filter-down'' effect from unpopular Republican candidates at the top of the ticket. (Schweitzer's Republican predecessor famously declared herself a ''lap dog of industry.'') In any event, the Democrats' success in 2004 was not an aberration; the party had been steadily gaining seats in the state chambers for the previous three elections.
 Schweitzer agrees that Democrats should be careful about trying to extrapolate Montana's political trends to other states. ''Montana ought not serve as a metaphor for the entire West,'' he told me. Indeed, Montana is the West's answer to New Hampshire: independent, contrary and unpredictable. Its demographic trends do not match that of the Southwest. The state's population is growing, but not skyrocketing the way it is in Arizona and Nevada, and with no city larger than 100,000 residents, Montana essentially does not have suburbs or exurbs like those spreading around Phoenix, Las Vegas and Denver. Hispanics account for less than 3 percent of the population; Montana's most sizable ethnic minority is Native American, at 6 percent of the population. And the state's voters have always been less conservative than their neighbors in Idaho, Utah and Wyoming. While it's true that Montanans voted for a Democratic president only twice in the past 50 years, they've often elected Democrats to the House and Senate. In fact, Max Baucus's Senate seat has been held by a Democrat since 1913. The meaning of the 2004 race is further complicated by the fact that Schweitzer chose a Republican -- albeit a moderate of the Jim Jeffords variety -- as his running mate.
 Within the state, politics have historically been split between east and west. Western Montana, with two college towns, Missoula and Bozeman; the unionized mining town Butte; and the capital, Helena, tends to vote more like the liberal Pacific Northwest. The east is more like the Great Plains, with vast ranches, farms, strip mines and oil fields. When the state had two Congressional districts (they were folded into one in 1993), the western one was consistently held by a Democrat and the eastern one by a Republican. According to David Sirota, who was a strategist for Schweitzer in both 2000 and 2004 and who now lives in Helena, the swing vote in the state is in and around Billings, the state's largest city. (''It is Yellowstone County that is Montana's own Ohio,'' he says, ''and Billings the state's Columbus.'') But unlike the rest of the nation, where swing voters are generally characterized as socially conservative suburbanites, Sirota says that many Montana swing voters are rural and libertarian. 
 Marc Racicot, who served two terms as Montana's governor before he went on to be chairman of the Republican National Committee and President Bush's 2004 campaign committee, says his fellow Montanans are unpredictable voters. ''You simply can't classify them,'' he told me, pointing out that in 2004 they simultaneously voted to ban gay marriage and to legalize medical marijuana. ''They are conservative in some ways, but ruggedly independent and populist in others. Party affiliation isn't necessarily the dominant characteristic they consider.'' Montanans are more mistrustful of large institutions like government and corporations than their counterparts on the coasts, while less religious than the South. Fifty-three percent of Montanans say they are pro-abortion rights. In foreign policy they can be rather isolationist: a poll in September showed that Montanans break with the national trend and rank the economy as more important than national security or the Iraq war. They take a libertarian approach to homeland security that is rarely heard nationally; Jon Tester, in a recent debate, said, ''With things like the Patriot Act, we'd damn well better keep our guns.'' And, contrary to the myth that Westerners are opposed to all environmental regulation, they tend to be conservationists. About 60 percent of Montanans favored the Roadless Area Conservation Rule, which protected land from logging; it was signed by Bill Clinton and overturned by George W. Bush. Bush's recent plan to auction off public lands was so unpopular in Montana that even Conrad Burns opposed it. 
 Montana's populist streak dates back more than a century to the mining labor movement, and it surfaced again in 1992, when Ross Perot captured more than a quarter of the vote, allowing Clinton to win the state. As the Republicans honed their populist message in the 1990's, their fortunes improved in Montana. Now, some say, the tide is turning. ''The appeal of populism never changed,'' Sirota says. ''The parties changed. The Republicans were the populists. Now the Democrats have learned that they can be populists, too.''
 It was a sunny day in June, and Brian Schweitzer and Max Baucus were flanked by Cessnas and helicopters, rallying with Jon Tester. Political rallies in other states might take place in hotel ballrooms; here in Montana everyone was gathered in an aircraft hangar outside Missoula. The place smelled like jet fuel. Corralling the top-ticket Montana Democrats in one place can resemble a ''Bonanza'' cast reunion, albeit with two Hosses and no Little Joe. Tester is a third-generation wheat farmer, president of the State Senate and a lumbering tank of a guy with a big gut and a flattop haircut. You want prairie authenticity? Have Tester show you his hand with just a thumb and a pinkie; the other three fingers were chopped off in a meat grinder when he was a boy. Tester, a progressive type, ran in the primary against a better-financed centrist, a career politician supported by the Democratic Leadership Council, and as soon as he won, Schweitzer leapt in to claim him as a brother. Onstage at the airport, Schweitzer played the down-home card. ''Jon's grandparents homesteaded just 20 miles from my grandparents,'' he hollered, to a roar of approval from the hangar. ''He and I were born in the same tiny hospital, up in Havre!''
 Other than the fact that they grew up on farms, it's not immediately clear what unites Schweitzer and Tester, Ritter and the Salazars. With his outspoken criticism of the war in Iraq -- ''I was very public before we went in that it was a bad idea, and history has borne that out,'' he told me -- Schweitzer has become a hero to progressives, while Ken Salazar has infuriated liberals with his support of Alberto Gonzalez's nomination for attorney general and his endorsement of Joe Lieberman's independent re-election bid. Governor Richardson of New Mexico suggests that such differences are evidence that the movement has no overarching strategy. ''It's happening from the bottom up,'' he told me. ''This is a natural evolution. It's no grand design.'' Or maybe it's that the region's Democrats simply don't have many core beliefs in common. Schweitzer remains an iconoclast; he says he supported John McCain's presidential bid in 2000, though he has since soured on McCain because of the way he has courted the religious right, and he says he is now intrigued by the possibility of a presidential run by Mitt Romney, the Republican governor of Massachusetts, in 2008. ''If he gets the nomination, I might support him,'' Schweitzer told me.
 Much of Schweitzer's attraction to voters lies in the fact that he doesn't seem like a politician. ''I'm just a rancher who ended up governor of Montana,'' he likes to say. But Schweitzer is not a politician only in the sense that the young Cassius Clay was not a boxer; by the time his opponent realized he'd been hit, he was already on the mat. And since it's accepted in the West that politicians are generally not to be trusted, Schweitzer's greatest talent may be his endless insistence that he's not one, all the while winning your vote and changing your opinion to agree with his. Which is, of course, what a politician does. His success is not the happy accident of a novice or a rube or a cowpoke who happened to ride his donkey into the halls of power -- but rather the work of an expert, a virtuoso or, perhaps, a natural.
 Besides getting elected and getting on television, what has Schweitzer actually accomplished? Much of the attention he has received came from positions he has taken on national issues: writing an Op-Ed for The Times about the miracle of coal-to-gas liquefaction, or requesting that President Bush return the Montana National Guardsmen from Iraq to fight summer forest fires. His agenda for his first legislative session was hardly radical: it included an increase in education financing, setting a goal to produce more wind power and a tax-reform bill that favored small business over big by eliminating the tax on business equipment valued at less than $20,000, while withdrawing a pending cut on more expensive equipment. He introduced an ultimately unsuccessful plan to prevent government officials from moving directly into lobbying jobs. Still, Schweitzer bristles at the suggestion that he was not sufficiently tested by his first session. ''I had 90 days to pass my agenda,'' he told me. ''It was my first day on the job, and I was working with lobbyists and legislators who'd been there for years. We had a State Assembly that was deadlocked. But I pushed through the most progressive legislative agenda in the country. It was not easy. I took on the lobbyists. I wrestled them to the ground, and now I'm kicking them in the ribs.''
 Despite the boots and bluster, at his core Brian Schweitzer is something of a policy wonk and a science whiz. He says he sleeps no more than five hours a night, and he is at his computer well before dawn, consuming a host of newspapers and a string of political blogs. His true passion is energy independence. On his desk is a contraption of tubes and coils that, as he enthusiastically explains, convert sunlight into hydrogen. In addition to his horsemanship and riflery, Schweitzer likes to tinker with gadgets, and he holds degrees in both soil science and agronomy. He will preach to anyone who will listen about the Fischer-Tropsch process of coal liquefaction, or about his recent switch from a Tahoe S.U.V. to a biodiesel Volkswagen Jetta.
 Schweitzer fancies that he will solve the energy crisis the Montana way, which is to say, with ethanol and syn-fuels and wind power, all readily available in a state that has more grain, coal and wind than it does people. He says he believes that he is setting an example for the rest of the world, and that tends to infuse even the most mundane details of his legislative work with a certain fervor.
 When I was visiting with Schweitzer one day during the legislative session, an aide rushed into his office with news that a group of Democratic state representatives from the Great Falls area were threatening to withdraw their support from the governor's ethanol bill. Schweitzer was leaning back in his chair, beneath an oil painting of a Native American woman playing a flute, beside a window opening onto a view of snow-covered mountains. If Schweitzer is, as his critics contend, mostly a showman, he has chosen the perfect stage. Helena's domed State Capitol is a transcendent gallery of marble columns and stained-glass atria, a temple so sincere in its exultation of frontier democracy that, for the cynical, it may resemble a Frank Capra movie version of government more than it resembles the real thing. Citizens wander freely in the corridors of power and, from the Senate gallery, can observe their lawmakers beneath frescoes of Lewis and Clark meeting Sacagawea, and of General Custer about to take a dagger to the gut at Little Bighorn. 
 The Great Falls representatives refused to come meet Schweitzer in the governor's office -- located about 800 steps from their chamber -- because they were upset that the governor canceled a meeting with them earlier that day. ''That's it,'' Schweitzer said, leaping up. ''I'm taking 'em to the woodshed.'' In an instant he was stomping down the corridor to the rotunda, his dog at his heels, and charging up the staircase to the House chamber. The governor corralled the Great Falls representatives in a meeting room and listened to their grievances. He leaned forward intently, his head bobbing almost imperceptibly, his eyes wide open and blinking in a strict cadence, receiving and processing data as if it were an electrical current. He clutched the edge of the table, and I suspected that if he let go, the rotors spinning in his skull would have broken the pull of gravity and sent him spiraling into orbit.
 Sufficiently charged, the governor whirred into action. His monologue combined pep talk and sales pitch, threats and promises, science lecture and economic briefing. He spoke at length on the difference between malt barley and high-protein wheat, and on the profit margin of ethanol refineries, pounding his finger on the tabletop for emphasis. He went on uninterrupted for seven minutes, and when the fusillade was over, one of the representatives voiced a small objection from an industry lobbyist that Montana wheat would make for low-grade ethanol.
 ''Now that,'' said the governor, slapping the table in triumph, almost evangelically, as if the Republic itself depended on this vote, ''that sounds like somebody who didn't take a single class in agronomy!''
 Later that day, everyone at the meeting voted yes on ethanol, and in the evenly split House, the bill passed 52-48.
 Hungry and emboldened, Democrats are already looking past 2006. A few stalwart Western Republicans who have been in the Senate since the Nixon years are rumored to be contemplating retirement in 2008. Pete Domenici of New Mexico will be 76, and Ted Stevens of Alaska will be 84. In Colorado, Democrats are so eager to oust Senator Wayne Allard that Representative Mark Udall has declared his candidacy a full three years before the election. Udall comes from the political dynasty that has spawned an Arizona Supreme Court justice and a handful of Democratic congressmen, and as a world-class mountaineer who says he is the only member of Congress to have made an attempt on Mount Everest, he fits the bill of an iconic Westerner.
 As Democrats look to Montana to try to figure out how to replicate Governor Schweitzer's success, they can't help noticing one recent poll number: in August, 66 percent of Montana Republicans said they approved of Schweitzer, the same portion who said they approved of Conrad Burns, their own party's incumbent senator. It may be that this sort of popularity comes only to a larger-than-life personality like Schweitzer. 
 Democrats will be wise not to try to replicate Schweitzer himself. When non-Schweitzers try to act like Schweitzer, it usually doesn't work. In his book, Schaller recalls ''campaign images of Al Gore wearing cowboy boots with his belt-clipped Blackberry, or a barn-jacket-clad John Kerry buying a goose-hunting license.'' Schaller goes on to write that these gestures force ''liberals to avert their eyes in horror, while conservatives look on from afar with a mixture of disdain and disbelief.''
 As for Schweitzer's own future plans, he dismisses questions about further political ambitions with one of his trademark similes -- something about having spent more days in a saddle than having been governor. Nonetheless, the scope of his battle is larger than Montana. In addition to campaigning for Jon Tester in Montana and Bill Ritter in Colorado, he also stumped recently at a fund-raiser in Jackson Hole, Wyo., for a singularly non-Western candidate: Eliot Spitzer of New York.

HEADLINE: Try Truth

BYLINE: By STANLEY B. GREENBERG

 BODY:
KARL ROVE is telling Republicans that they should campaign on the American economy, virtually the ''strongest in the world,'' and on the Iraq war because Republicans will be there for ''the last tough battles,'' while Democrats ''fall back on the party's old platform of cutting and running.'' 
 Well, do you want to know what I am telling Democrats? Run on the economy and Iraq. We want this battle. This is indeed the strongest economy in the world for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. But there has been so little income growth for so many years that the great majority of citizens face stagnant incomes, growing financial pressures, high health care and gas prices, and jobs with fewer and fewer benefits.
The more Republicans talk about great times, the more they fuel voter frustration with a party out of touch with people's financial worries. And the more Republicans talk about ''cut and run,'' the more voters focus on the ugliness of today's Baghdad. It is as though a smug conservative debate team were so busy winning the argument over setting a withdrawal deadline that it completely missed the consuming national anxiety and anger over the deception and incompetence, the misplaced priorities, the spread of violence and the failure to keep America safe. So, Karl, thank you. 
 -- STANLEY B. GREENBERG, author of ''The Two Americas: Our Current Political Deadlock and How to Break It'' and former adviser to President Bill Clinton.

HEADLINE: Face the Wave

BYLINE: By JENNIFER GROSSMAN

 BODY:
WHAT should be the Republican strategy in November? Duckdive or turtle. Those are the choices surfers have when they can't scratch over huge closeout waves. And that's what this election will be for Republicans: a rogue cleanup set that will sweep feeble and indecisive political paddlers to shore. 
 It becomes clearer every day that House Republicans will fail to take the kinds of measures that might minimize political fallout from the Mark Foley Follies. Like forcing Dennis Hastert's resignation. Or passing a statute that makes sexual solicitation of a page or intern by an elected congressman immediate grounds for removal.
Such dramatic, emphatic, ''I really get it'' actions might buy Republicans enough time to credibly return the focus to the economy, or to immigration, or to the fight against radical Islamic nihilism. But at present the party remains stuck in defensive blame shifting -- what Jack Welch identified as the third stage of crisis management (after denial and containment). Unless the House can bring itself to face the fourth stage -- blood (in this case, Mr. Hastert's) on the floor -- voters will wield the electoral ax themselves. Even that might not be so bad. Remember: from the ashes of the Nixon resignation, Ronald Reagan rose just six years later.

HEADLINE: Out With the Old

BYLINE: By R. EMMETT TYRRELL JR.

 BODY:
IN the brevity of this encounter let me say that Republicans striving to maintain control of the House and Senate should be mindful of the two historic conditions of the present moment. 
 First, the Old Order is passing. The political party that has for three generations favored government solutions for all manner of human discomfort is now down to one desideratum, to wit, banish the sinful Republicans from government and restore virtue to public life, virtue as embodied by Bill and Hillary Clinton, George Soros and various aging rock stars. For most Americans, this is a hard sell.
Second, within the Democratic Party, the 1960's generation is passing. The Clintons, the Gores and John Forbes Kerry have worn out their welcome with a younger generation of Democrats. This rising generation may have no New Deals to propound, but it cites its colossal anger as reason for the electorate to support it. In prosperous and free America, anger is not a fetching political program. 
 Given these conditions, the Republicans should affirm the New Order that has made them politically numero uno. Affirm growth economics. Affirm national security. Remind the Republican base of the conservative judges who have been confirmed, and rouse that base with the promise of more to come. Finally, reassure the base that the Republicans' older generation in leadership is giving way to vigorous advocates of libertarian, conservative policies, like Representatives Mike Pence, John Shadegg and Paul Ryan.

HEADLINE: Cry 'Pelosi'

BYLINE: By LISA SCHIFFREN

 BODY:
FIRST, get up from that defensive crouch. Until last week no one had ever heard of Mark Foley. He's been booted. His actions were immoral and perhaps criminal. But lewd e-mail messages don't have the graphic sexual imagery of, say, cigars or stained dresses. Silently thank Bill Clinton for lowering the moral bar for officeholders. 
 It's time to project strength abroad. There is a fine line between ''staying the course'' and doing the same thing over and over and hoping for a different result. Mr. President, send a lot of troops to Iraq. Next week. Squash some insurgents.
Candidates should incessantly mention that there have been ZERO terrorist attacks since 9/11 -- a result of administration policy. And the Bush tax cuts have created a strong economy with two (!) record closings of the Dow last week.
 Remind conservatives, who may be annoyed at you, that ''sending a message'' will make Nancy Pelosi the speaker of the House. Ms. Pelosi's Democrats have no plan for Iraq, except leaving; they will not contain immigration and their recently clarified position on domestic security is that we shouldn't wiretap terrorists, but must read the e-mail correspondence of gay congressmen. 
 As for spending, there should have been much less of it. Your base is livid about this -- though it confirms what we think about the evils of government. If someone brings it up, remind voters that, while the Republicans have spent like a drunken sailor, Democrats will do worse, cold sober.
 Finally, do not go to the mats for Dennis Hastert. Leak rumors that the next speaker (or, if it comes to that, minority leader) will be more principled and articulate than Mr. Hastert, a former wrestling coach, while having more coach-like skill in keeping the team out of trouble. 
 -- LISA SCHIFFREN, speechwriter for Vice President Dan Quayle from 1991 to 1992.

HEADLINE: Germany Drafts Policy for Europe to Strengthen Russian Ties 

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: BERLIN, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
The German Foreign Ministry is preparing a new policy toward the east that aims to tighten ties between Russia and Europe, but does not address human rights, a theme dear to Chancellor Angela Merkel. 
 According to Foreign Ministry officials, the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, has been informed of the policy and likes it. He will visit Germany on Tuesday for a meeting of the Petersburg Circle, a group established five years ago to promote economic, cultural, social and youth links between Russia and Germany.
The policy is described in an internal paper prepared by the ministry. The subtext is clearly Europe's increasing dependence on Russia to meet its energy needs. 
 But Mrs. Merkel won support from the German public last year by promising a more critical approach toward Russia, and her advisers say she prefers an approach to the east that takes into account the interests of Poland and the Baltic states, not just Western Europe's ties to Russia.
 ''The view of the chancellery is that we have to take care of Poland, Ukraine and the immediate neighborhood,'' said Jorg Himmelreich, a regional expert in the Berlin office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States.
 The Foreign Ministry paper advocates the adoption of this policy by the European Union during Germany's six-month presidency of the bloc, which begins Jan. 1.
 The gap in the approaches is, at least in part, a reflection of the power-sharing arrangement created after inconclusive elections last September. To create a governing coalition in Parliament, Mrs. Merkel crafted a deal between her Christian Democratic Party and the rival Social Democratic Party in which they split the posts in the 16-member cabinet and she became chancellor. 
 The Foreign Ministry's paper, titled ''The German E.U. Presidency: Russia, European Neighborhood Policy and Central Asia,'' states that ''Russia will play a central role in the German E.U. presidency.''
 In the ministry's vision, this policy would actively engage Russia and the post-Soviet states to bring them closer to Europe.
 The section on Russia highlights the energy ties with Europe that were strengthened by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, a Social Democrat, from 1998 to 2005. 
 Mr. Schroder developed a friendship with Mr. Putin. On losing to Mrs. Merkel last year, Mr. Schroder was immediately appointed to head a German-Russian gas consortium dominated by Gazprom, Russia's state-owned monopoly.
 Some analysts say the Foreign Ministry's outlined policy is shortsighted, because it does not challenge energy relations.
 ''Germany is becoming increasingly dependent on Russia for its energy,'' said Prof. Claudia Kempfert, an energy expert at the German Institute for Economic Research. ''This dependence is dangerous, given how Putin is trying to push foreign investors out.'' 
 Other experts note that it is uncertain that the policy described in the Foreign Ministry paper would lead to better relations. 
 ''We don't have influence with Russia,'' said Roland Gotz, a Russian expert at the government-financed German Institute for International and Security Affairs. ''We cannot integrate Russia into NATO or the E.U., because Russia does not want to be integrated. We have no levers.''

HEADLINE: A Bet on Ethanol, With a Convert at the Helm

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: DECATUR, Ill. 

 BODY:
BACK in 1999, when she was the head of refining at Chevron, Patricia A. Woertz told a group of energy officials that it was ''time to stop mixing agricultural policy with fuels policy.''
 In that same speech, at a fuels conference in Washington, Ms. Woertz also publicly expressed worry about the ''unintended consequences'' of a federal mandate requiring the use of corn-based ethanol in gasoline.
Today Ms. Woertz is standing on the other side of the gasoline debate, wholeheartedly supporting the growth of ethanol, the fuel the oil industry loves to hate but has had to learn to live with. In May, she took over as the chief executive of Archer Daniels Midland, the giant agricultural company that also happens to be the biggest ethanol producer in the country.
 A.D.M. spent nearly three decades pushing relentlessly for the use of ethanol in gasoline, lobbying Congress and the White House and rousing farmers. But only in the last few years, amid record-high oil prices and government mandates to use ethanol, has this clear, colorless fuel -- a form of ethyl alcohol -- finally begun to catch on, transforming it from a dream into almost a religion in the Midwestern states that produce corn. 
 Ethanol has been a boon to A.D.M.'s fortunes, helping it to achieve record earnings last year of $1.3 billion on sales of $36.6 billion. While the company does not break down the sources of its profit, analysts say ethanol could make up 40 percent of A.D.M.'s net income in fiscal 2007, about double what it meant to the company last year.
 With that bigger profit potential has come greater volatility in A.D.M.'s stock, which lately has mirrored more closely the rise and fall of energy prices. That has caused some analysts to caution its investors to go slow on the company. 
 ''For the bulk of the company's history, the vast majority of their profits came from crushing products like corn to feed the world,'' said Eric Katzman, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. But a greater proportion of A.D.M.'s earnings will come from biofuels in the future, he said, as a large portion of the $2.4 billion the company plans to invest in the next two years is energy related. 
 So far, that capital is devoted to sustaining corn as the preferred crop for producing ethanol. While ethanol can be made more cheaply from sugar cane, as it is in Brazil, lobbying by A.D.M. and farm-state politicians has helped corn win out as the crop of choice for ethanol in the United States. It did not hurt that the powerful American sugar lobby helped to erect trade barriers keeping out cheaper imported sugar and cheaper imported ethanol. 
 MOST politicians originally saw ethanol as a way to help farmers to make more money from their corn crop. Now it is being seen by policy makers, including President Bush, as a partial antidote to the nation's reliance on foreign oil. To achieve that vision of energy independence will require much more ethanol, and many agricultural experts have begun to worry about the food-for-fuel trade-off of using so much corn -- more than 60 percent of which is used to feed livestock, an important American export -- to produce fuel. And corn is one of the most energy-intensive and water-intensive crops to grow anywhere.
 But A.D.M. has been slow thus far to be a party to research that might sway ethanol production away from corn and into crops that require less water and fossil-fuel based fertilizers; one such crop is switchgrass, a tall prairie grass that is highly drought resistant. Some outside experts call A.D.M.'s strategy shortsighted.
 ''I am sure A.D.M. shareholders want the company to be economically viable for the next 20 to 25 years, not just for the next 5 to 10,'' said Clayton K. Yeutter, a former secretary of agriculture and United States trade representative. ''If ethanol is going to be a significant part of A.D.M.'s profits, they should have as much interest in finding the lower-cost inputs as anyone would.''
 Sitting in a conference room in A.D.M.'s global headquarters, Ms. Woertz, 53, did not dwell on the risks of A.D.M.'s focus on corn as the primary source of ethanol. She promoted ethanol's growth potential, saying she sees the fuel making up 10 percent of the country's gasoline supply, by sometime next decade, up from about 4 percent this year. 
 The idea that ethanol could one day replace more than half of gasoline is not out of the realm of possibility, either, she said, but will require successful development of ethanol from agricultural waste like corn stalks, or hardy grasses like switchgrass. The technology to efficiently produce this so-called ''cellulosic'' ethanol is most likely many years away. In any event, ''We will be there when it's there,'' she said. ''We want to intersect the future and still be a big player in the bio-energy world.''
 She said she saw little contradiction in her previous concern about the fuel -- a worry that she said was tied to federal clean air standards for tailpipe emissions and the debate over how to meet them. Refiners, she said, wanted to be told what the emissions standards were and to allow their scientists to find a way to meet them, rather than to have a specific gasoline formulation dictated by regulators. 
 ''Things have evolved,'' she said, and the oil industry and ethanol producers ''have come to work much more closely on the fuel supplies for this country.''
 Many analysts saw the hiring of Ms. Woertz as a signal that A.D.M. wanted to become the Exxon Mobil of ethanol. Indeed, her energy experience helped win her the job, A.D.M. officials said. But they added that she was also selected because her background as a strategic planner at Chevron gave A.D.M.'s board members the confidence that she could chart a vision for the company's future.
 ''We needed someone that was a proven and capable strategist,'' said Kelvin R. Westbrook, the board member who led the search process. Her energy experience ''was a valued part of her background but by no means was it a determining factor.''
 Ms. Woertz arrives at a favorable time in the company's 104-year history. A.D.M. paid $400 million last year to settle the last of a pile of lawsuits stemming from a price-fixing scandal in the mid-1990's involving lysine, an animal feed additive. Three top executives were sent to prison over the scandal, including Michael D. Andreas, A.D.M.'s former executive vice president and the son of Dwayne O. Andreas, the chief executive who led the company for 27 years.
 At the same time, prices are rising for high-fructose corn syrup and other products that A.D.M. processes from corn, soybeans and wheat. And the demand for ethanol is forecast to soar as federally mandated fuel formulations take effect. Congress passed a law last year requiring refiners to increase their use of ethanol to 7.5 billion gallons by 2012, from 4 billion this year.
 The future looks even better, if that is possible. While the federal government has mandated greater ethanol use in the United States, European governments are pushing for higher use of soybean-based biodiesel in the fuel supply. A.D.M. is one of the world's biggest producers of both of those fuels.
 A.D.M. is also the world's largest producer of food and animal feed. The company, which adopted the slogan ''Supermarket to the World'' in the 1990's, says it makes enough to feed 300 million people, as well as many millions of cows, chickens and pigs.
 WHEN Ms. Woertz looks to the future, she sees the twin trends of a growing population that needs additional food -- with a diet that increasingly demands protein -- and the quest for alternative sources of energy to oil.
 She said A.D.M. was ''uniquely positioned'' to benefit from growing global demand for both food and fuel. ''We have the technologies, we have the assets and we have the infrastructure,'' she said.
 That optimism is apparent in A.D.M.'s latest annual report, the first to feature Ms. Woertz. Its title is ''We See Opportunity.''
 How exactly A.D.M. will go about capitalizing on its opportunities remains to be seen. Ms. Woertz says senior managers are working on a plan, to be unveiled to analysts in November, that will outline the company's biofuels strategy over the next decade.
 While the plan is still being drafted, Ms. Woertz said that it clearly would involve a stronger push by A.D.M. to develop ways to make ethanol from grasses and agricultural waste -- cellulosic ethanol. She hinted that the plan might involve partnerships with venture capitalists like Vinod Khosla, the founding chief executive of Sun Microsystems, who is investing in companies working on cellulosic ethanol and other alternative fuels, and stumping for ethanol all over the country.
 In August, Ms. Woertz invited Mr. Khosla to sit in on a meeting in Chicago of A.D.M.'s strategic planning committee, where he briefed the executives on cellulosic ethanol opportunities.
 ''We have discussed opportunities we could pursue together,'' Ms. Woertz said of Mr. Khosla. ''All of this question about the longer term is something we absolutely have under way and there will be more to come.''
 In Decatur, Ms. Woertz and two other top executives at the company made it clear that A.D.M.'s plans, for the moment, revolved mostly around getting ethanol from corn. The company has little concern about the amount of corn being harvested for biofuels, even as it is set to commercialize a promising new technology to produce biodegradable plastics that will use even more corn.
 Ms. Woertz and the other A.D.M. executives said they believed that the genetic modification of corn seed, which has led to a 75 percent increase in corn yields since 1980, would continue to keep pace with growing demand for nonfood products like ethanol. That stands in stark contrast to the concern of some agriculture executives -- notably Warren R. Staley, chief executive of Cargill, an A.D.M. rival -- that if the ethanol boom were left unchecked, it would eventually raise food prices and hurt America's grain exports.
 At A.D.M.'s main research center, a converted high school here in Decatur, two company executives seemed unfazed by that concern. Mark G. Matlock, senior vice president for research and development, said A.D.M. was trying to wring more ethanol out of unused parts of the corn crop. He said he was less optimistic about the near-term economics of producing ethanol from switchgrass, an idea promoted by President Bush in his State of the Union address this year. While switchgrass is cheaper to grow than corn, it would be more costly to convert to ethanol, partly because the country lacks the machines to harvest and transport switchgrass efficiently as a crop.
 ''From a strategy standpoint it made the most sense to look at the existing corn streams that we are handling through our network of everything from country elevators to processing facilities,'' said Edward A. Harjehausen, the senior vice president for food and feed ingredients. The company is involved in a research project with the Energy Department to take the corn fiber stream and convert as much of the cellulose as possible to additional ethanol.
 The way the A.D.M. executives see it, by focusing on waste streams already coming out of its corn-processing plants, the company can avoid the ''chicken and egg'' problems that other companies may face in trying to make cellulosic ethanol from new crops like switchgrass: farmers may be hesitant to grow the grass until there is a market for the crop, but companies will be reluctant to create a market and build separate processing plants until they see a ready supply of raw material. 
 ''Everyone has this vision in the end of a billion tons of biomass generating all of our fuel needs,'' Mr. Matlock said. ''That is the far vision. So we focus on those intermediate steps to get to the vision.''
 Ms. Woertz is a fresh start for a company that had been run by four families for a century. The families once controlled more than half its board seats and still control some 10 percent of A.D.M.'s stock, analysts said. That insular grip on power allowed the company to make long-term bets, which paid off handily. In the 1970's, for example, A.D.M. invested heavily in factories to make high-fructose corn syrup, a low-cost corn-based sweetener that later replaced sugar in Coke and Pepsi and hundreds of other foods. 
 A.D.M. fell into the biofuels business later in the decade, when the company tried to solve a problem with seasonal overcapacity in its corn syrup plants by producing something else from abundant corn supplies: ethanol. That set off a two-decade-long lobbying and public-relations effort by the elder Mr. Andreas to win broader acceptance for ethanol as a fuel. 
 CRITICS, noting ethanol's shortcomings like its lower energy content versus gasoline and the fact that it receives a 51-cent-a-gallon subsidy, say that while the marketing campaign has been good for the company, it has been bad for the country. ''A.D.M.'s role in the ethanol debate has largely been to provide the narrative that the politicians need to justify the handouts they want to give to farmers anyway,'' said Jerry Taylor, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who has been critical of ethanol.
 The ethanol promotion campaign was hurt when the lysine price-fixing scandal torpedoed A.D.M.'s reputation. Secret audio tapes made by a former executive, Mark E. Whitacre, in the early-1990's revealed a scheme by top A.D.M. executives to fix the global price for lysine with executives from Japanese, French and Korean competitors. Michael Andreas and Terrance S. Wilson, the head of corn processing, were both sentenced to two years in prison for their roles in the scandal. Mr. Whitacre was sentenced to nine years for embezzling $9.5 million at the same time he was helping the government to investigate his bosses.
 Since the scandals shook public confidence in A.D.M., the board has been overhauled with independent outsiders like Mr. Westbrook, who joined in 2003 and is chief executive of Millennium Digital Media, a broadband services company. Ms. Woertz's hiring continues the trend.
 ''The board was cognizant of the fact that A.D.M.'s image had approached a Mafioso level over the last few decades with all the scandals,'' said John M. McMillin, a longtime analyst for the Prudential Equity Group. ''I am not sure she understands the difference between a soybean and a rapeseed, but she knows people and has identified the people within the company to trust.''
 Ms. Woertz's energy background, especially in refining, has helped her grasp quickly the basics of A.D.M.'s agricultural business. Oil refiners take a barrel of crude oil and process it into a slate of products like gasoline and jet fuel. A.D.M. takes a bushel of corn or soybeans and spits out dozens of food products on the other side.
 Mr. Westbrook and analysts agree that she also brings a human touch that was lacking at A.D.M. in the past. A divorced mother of three grown children, she quickly embraced the idea of moving to Decatur, a sleepy city of 78,000. Other candidates hoped to commute to work from Chicago, some 180 miles away, Mr. Westbrook said.
 SHE is also comfortable with bold initiatives. A.D.M. once controlled more than 60 percent of ethanol production, but today it controls less than 25 percent after the building of a number of farmer-owned ethanol plants in recent years. A.D.M. is planning to recapture some market share by adding 550 million gallons of ethanol capacity over the next two years, pushing up its total by 50 percent, to 1.65 billion gallons.
 Ms. Woertz is also fascinated by aspects of A.D.M. that have nothing to do with biofuels, especially the company's push to commercialize technology that uses corn starch to make plastics that, theoretically, at least, are biodegradable.
 At one point, she reached behind her chair and pulled a clear plastic bag from her purse containing several green plastic items, including golf tees. ''This is made from corn, so it is a corn and starch stream, and you can dial up or dial down the biodegradability,'' she said, showing off a tee. ''People throw their spoons out the window from McDonald's. Ours will biodegrade.''
 But for now, it is ethanol, the fuel she once questioned, that is giving Ms. Woertz the spotlight. She is set to make her first public speech since becoming C.E.O. at a conference promoting biofuels on Wednesday in St. Louis, where she will be joined by Mike Johanns, the secretary of agriculture; Samuel W. Bodman, the energy secretary; and Charles O. Holliday Jr., the chief executive of DuPont. President Bush has been invited and may speak on Thursday. 
 One person who has reviewed Ms. Woertz's speech said it would focus on the ''innovation, investment, partnership and vision'' needed to ensure that biofuels ''fulfill their promise in meeting global needs for sustainable supply, energy security and environmental improvement.''

HEADLINE: Paying for Performance, But Not Share Price

 BODY:
THE compensation of chief executives should be linked to the wealth they create for shareholders, says Robert W. Lane, the chief of Deere & Company, the farm equipment maker based in Moline, Ill. Here are excerpts from a conversation: 


Q. Are some chief executives overpaid?

A. It's possible. What we tried to do, starting in December 2000, was to set up some very high aspirations for improving John Deere's business, at that time 165 years old. Together with the board and senior management, we said, ''It's been good enough for all these years. We have some strengths,'' but Deere had not been known for being a great business. So we set out to create a compensation structure to support that objective and compensate myself and the rest of the senior leadership of the company in a very aligned way.

Q. According to your proxy, you made about $3.5 million in salary and bonus in 2005, and as much as $7.8 million in stock and options. Is that excessive?

A. Not in the eyes of our board, which independently determined that the compensation was appropriate in view of the company's overall performance. Since I became chairman and C.E.O. in August 2000, we have focused on creating economic profit -- or the value we have created for shareholders -- and, for the last two years, it has more than doubled from its previous high.

Q. Your company has divided compensation into three segments -- short-term, medium-term and long-term compensation incentives, which are linked to criteria like return on assets, as opposed to share price. Using your short-term incentive as an example, how did you carry out this system?

A. It wasn't rocket science. Our short-term incentive applies to all salaried employees and it's all rooted in operating return on operating assets. It's how we earned on the basis of what we invested. Every employee is rewarded on how well they invested shareholders' money.

Q. Most chief executives' compensation is linked to share price. Is that the wrong criterion?

A. It could be. Or it could be that it's not based on long-enough-term results. In our case, the midterm incentive was new to us. It is a payment on the absolute creation of shareholder value. That is based on a sustained four-year performance, and our company has a long history of sometimes doing well for a short period of time and then losing it all. For example, we lost more than $2 billion in shareholder value from 1999 to 2003. That was more than twice what we had earned in the entire 1990's.
 Now the new program says that if we lose a lot of shareholder value, then we never get the pay, even though it was fully approved. It's not paid out until we earn it over a rolling four-year period. This helps us think about doing the right thing for the long term. 

Q. If your compensation were at risk of declining, would you go to the board and say: ''Keep me whole. Don't let me get hurt''?

A. No. First of all, I don't go to the board and ask them or talk to them about my compensation. I do not know what is presented to the compensation committee in advance. I don't meet with them. They decide and tell me.

Q. How has Deere withstood the erosion of Midwest manufacturing?

A. We made the decision to invest over $100 million in our Waterloo, Iowa, operations, specifically to allow us to dramatically improve the performance of that operation. Otherwise it couldn't have met the targets we had in mind. I'm talking about bringing down the flow-through, in terms of what is needed to get a tractor completed, from, say, 45 days to 7 days, to cut the amount of space that's involved in half and to improve the quality. We've invested additionally in Davenport and Dubuque, Iowa.
 At the same time, we've also broadened our presence around the world. We now own a complete factory in India where we make transmissions, diesel engines and complete tractors, which we sell in India and other parts of the world as well as the United States. We have factories in China that we now own 100 percent of. We're building a new tractor factory in Brazil right now. We moved diesel engine production from Dubuque down to Mexico. Where we can't be competitive here, we will move operations, after rigorous analysis, to where we can be competitive.

Q. Do those investments offshore really support your domestic operations and the overall American standard of living?

A. The answer unequivocally is yes. We talk about this a lot. Our customers' standards of living and that of the people in our communities -- it's not just our employees that we talk about, or just our customers, it's all our communities -- their lives are enhanced as global trade improves. The wonderful thing about business is that it is not necessarily a win-lose proposition. It can be win-win. In our case, if we just served people here in this country, we would not be able to do it economically. We wouldn't deliver the finest in technology.
 Our customers end up exporting a great deal. So by investing worldwide, we improve the lives of people in other parts of the world, which in turn helps us improve our lives.

Q. But isn't it true that on an emotional level, a majority of Americans probably don't buy that argument?

A. That may be true. But just take the people who make combine harvesters in East Moline, Ill., or tractors in Waterloo, Iowa. Many of those products are being exported to other parts of the world. They realize how important that is.

HEADLINE: A Ride To Glory, Or Market?

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS and JULIE BOSMAN

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich. 

 BODY:
IN the gift shop of the Henry Ford Museum, just steps away from the brightly painted city bus that Rosa Parks defiantly rode into history books 51 years ago, there are tributes of a very different sort to the woman who helped tear down the walls of racial segregation in America.
 A T-shirt bearing an image of Bus 2857 from Montgomery, Ala., will set you back $24. For a mere $4.99, you can buy a refrigerator magnet with a picture of the bus. A poster of the famous, albeit staged, 1956 photo by United Press International of Mrs. Parks sitting in front of a white man on a different bus goes for $16. The word ''Destiny'' is written above the photo.
 There are no fewer than five biographies of Mrs. Parks on sale in the gift shop, including a glossy hardcover picture book and a small paperback, ''Don't Know Much About Rosa Parks.'' 
 And as far as Rosa Parks memorabilia goes, this is the tasteful stuff. 
 On eBay, one seller recently offered commemorative dog tags with her picture for $5.99, not including shipping. Also for sale online were a dishwasher-safe coffee cup bearing a likeness of Mrs. Parks -- $11.21, shipping included -- and an 8-by-10-inch photo of her in an open coffin after her death in October last year. ''The rarest photograph of all,'' boasted the caption on this $10 snapshot. The cemetery in Detroit where Mrs. Parks is buried recently raised prices for crypts near her grave to $60,000 from about $45,000. 
 Rosa Parks -- civil rights symbol in life, marketing phenomenon in death -- has become the centerpiece of the kind of posthumous peddling usually associated with athletes and Hollywood stars. While licensing experts estimate the current value of selling Mrs. Parks's image at only six figures a year, they say that over time millions of dollars will be made by those who control her likeness. Mrs. Parks's courage and standing have also made her one of the few recent African-American political figures, along with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, whose image can generate handsome profits.
 While the likenesses of historical and political figures, from George Washington to Ronald Reagan, are commonly plastered on all sorts of knickknacks, milking the image of Mrs. Parks offers a particularly resonant example of the fine line between good taste and bad, between memorialization and exploitation and between the positive and negative uses of hard-core business marketing. 
 Indeed, profiting from Mrs. Parks's image has long drawn the ire of those who watch over her legacy. But faced with limited resources, her estate has found it impossible to stop everyone who sees dollar signs when they hear the name Rosa Parks.
 Anita Peek, executive director of the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development, the organization that Mrs. Parks charged with safeguarding her image, said that all of the jockeying around the civil rights hero has largely left her resigned to accept a time-worn truism. 
 ''It's America,'' Ms. Peek says. ''And if you can make a buck, someone's going to try to do something.'' 
 THE Parks Institute has decided that if it cannot beat the marketing pack, it might as well join it. In April, it hired CMG Worldwide, a company in Indianapolis that is a powerhouse in the world of celebrity licensing and merchandising. The company handles rights to such luminaries as Marilyn Monroe, James Dean and Mark Twain. Type ''CMG Worldwide'' into Google, and a Who's Who of celebrity Web sites pops up: Jean Harlow, Babe Ruth, Duke Ellington, Vince Lombardi and more, all carrying virtual warning labels bearing the CMG name. 
 RosaParks.com is next on CMG's acquisition list. A cybersquatter currently controls the domain, and CMG is trying to gain the legal rights to it -- without filing a lawsuit. ''We're in the process of getting it back,'' said Mark Roesler, the chairman and chief executive of CMG. ''We anticipate it being an amicable transfer.''
 Mr. Roesler, a 25-year veteran of the licensing business, is accustomed to legal battles involving the Web. Nearly all of the celebrity estates that CMG represents have been engaged in disputes over domain names. ''Typically, with a famous personality, someone who doesn't have the legitimate right to it is hoping to gain something from it,'' he said. 
 Corporate America is also hoping to capitalize on Mrs. Parks's aura, and CMG recently negotiated an estimated six-figure deal with General Motors on behalf of the Parks estate. In a new 60-second Chevrolet commercial, the 1956 U.P.I. photo appears amid a blizzard of Americana images, including Hula Hoop dancers, Vietnam War demonstrators, Richard M. Nixon and Joe Louis.
 Advertisers, after all, have become fond of exhuming dead celebrities to appear in commercials, and Mrs. Parks offers the added oomph of having been something more. She is revered and widely known for doing the right thing -- giving her special cachet in the marketing business. Her likeness has already appeared in a well-known Apple Computer ad that affixed the label ''Think Different'' to the bus passenger photo. 
 Whether Mrs. Parks would have participated in any of this -- or even condoned it -- is, of course, a moot question.
 ''The great thing about dead celebrities is that they don't show up and get in trouble any more,'' said Jeff Lotman, the chief executive of Global Icons, a licensing agency in Los Angeles. 
 Decisions about how Mrs. Parks's image is used and who profits from it are the subject of a legal dispute between her surviving family members and the executors of her estate. Twelve of Mrs. Parks's 13 nieces and nephews, her closest surviving relatives, have challenged her will in a probate court in Detroit. Their aunt's will leaves them out of the decision-making process and out of nearly all of the money when it comes to licensing her name and image. The two sides were unable to settle, and their lawyers are now taking depositions in preparation for a trial.
 William McCauley, 47, one of Mrs. Parks's nephews, is leading the family's legal battle against her estate's executors. Mr. McCauley said he began seeing his aunt's image pop up in advertisements all over Detroit shortly after her death. One of those ads, which ran in The Detroit Free Press, showed his aunt's smiling face, along with the dates of her birth and death, next to a logo for the Greektown Casino, a local gambling establishment. ''What a ride,'' the ad said in bold type. 
 ''We were never approached,'' said Mr. McCauley, a soft-spoken and reserved man. ''I thought that was inappropriate. Especially without involving any family members to let them know what's going on.''
 Mr. McCauley said he and his siblings were challenging the will so they could gain control over marketing and licensing decisions involving their aunt's image. ''We can't do anything about it right now,'' he said. ''We're in court right now for that very reason.''
 Uncertainty about the control of Mrs. Parks's image has been heightened by the fact that she was surrounded by counselors of varying visions for her legacy, both political and business, from almost the moment that she became famous. ''Over the years, Mrs. Parks has had a lot of advisers,'' said Jon B. Gandelot, one of her former lawyers. 
 When Mrs. Parks was alive, decisions about using her name fell to her Parks Institute in Detroit, which she founded in 1987 with her longtime friend Elaine Eason Steele. Mrs. Parks herself was involved in deciding exactly when and where her likeness could appear until late in her life, when she suffered from dementia. 
 ''She would approve and say, 'Yes, that's fine,' or, 'No, I won't allow that,' say, if it was her picture on a keychain or something,'' said Shirley Kaigler, who was Mrs. Parks's personal lawyer and advised the Parks Institute on licensing issues.
 When Mrs. Parks died, control of her image -- and over the cash generated by marketing it -- fell to her estate. In 1998, seven years before her death, she appointed Mrs. Steele and Gregory J. Reed, a lawyer in Detroit, as her executors. In 2003, Mrs. Parks replaced Mr. Reed with a retired judge in Detroit, Adam Shakoor. After Mrs. Parks's death, Mrs. Steele agreed to be replaced by Mr. McCauley, a move that Mrs. Parks's circle of lawyers and advisers hoped would avoid a legal challenge from the McCauley family.
 But the McCauley family and the estate were unable to agree on how to divvy up her property, and a court battle ensued. A judge recently removed Mr. Shakoor and Mr. McCauley as executors, replacing them with two local lawyers, John M. Chase and Melvin D. Jefferson. Both of those lawyers declined repeated requests for interviews.
 Previously, the most notable struggle over Mrs. Parks's affairs was a lawsuit that her advisers filed against LaFace Records, producers for OutKast, the hip-hop duo. OutKast recorded a song, ''Rosa Parks,'' (''Ah ha, hush that fuss/Everybody move to the back of the bus'') which appeared on its 1998 album, ''Aquemini.'' Mrs. Parks sued LaFace and various record distributors for $5 billion, contending that the song defamed her.
 LaFace Records, and its parent company, Sony BMG Music, settled the case a few months before Mrs. Parks died, for an undisclosed amount.
 During the OutKast litigation, Mr. McCauley's family was vocal in its opposition, saying that Mrs. Parks was far too modest to have ever consented to a $5 billion lawsuit. They also said they doubted that she was aware the case was even going on. 
 At the time, Mrs. Parks's relatives described her as feeble and apparently unaware of her surroundings. But even in instances when there may be consensus about exploitation of Mrs. Parks's legacy, her family and the executors of her estate cannot agree on how aggressively to pursue those who make unauthorized use of the Parks name.
 ''It's hard to police unless you have the financial wherewithal,'' Ms. Kaigler said. ''What do you do if they're somebody down in Texas and you're in Michigan?''
 In fact, for those in charge of protecting and managing Mrs. Parks's legacy, there are few clear examples for them to follow. The family of Dr. King has been famously aggressive and litigious when it comes to his image, likeness and properties -- and it has made handsome sums along the way. Despite the disrepair of the King Center in recent years, Dr. King's two sons have continued to collect six-figure salaries from the center -- a situation that many in Atlanta viewed with distaste. The King Center did not respond to requests for comment.
 BEFORE he died, Dr. King donated 80,000 pages of his papers to Boston University, where he received his doctorate, suggesting that he wanted his private papers to be freely available to researchers. His wife, Coretta, later tried to get them back but was unsuccessful. Then last June, the King family sold a separate 10,000-item collection from his archives for $32 million to a company that was hastily formed by a nonprofit organization to keep the papers in Atlanta, Dr. King's birthplace. At the time, critics of the family accused it of appearing greedy. 
 The King family's previous efforts to assert control over Dr. King's image provoked even more scorn. In a lawsuit in 1996, the estate accused CBS of copyright infringement after the television network began promoting a video that contained clips of Dr. King's ''I Have a Dream'' speech. (The family later dropped the lawsuit in exchange for an undisclosed cash payment.) When USA Today published the same speech in 1993, the King family filed a lawsuit, which was later settled, contending copyright infringement.
 The King family has always defended its strict management of Dr. King's image and likeness, an approach that some marketing experts applaud.
 ''The more you say no, the better it is for the brand,'' said Allen Adamson, the managing director of Landor Associates, a branding agency that is a unit of the WPP Group. The Parks family, Mr. Adamson, said, ''has to be very careful because what you do not want to do is take someone whose image is as pristine and untouched as hers, and overuse it.''
 The danger in overusing Mrs. Parks's image, Mr. Adamson added, is that people could start to say, ''How dare you commercialize what she did and how she did it?''
 For the Parks estate, the scramble for a piece of the action began almost immediately after Mrs. Parks's death, when entrepreneurs found out just how lucrative her name could be. Copies of the program from her funeral quickly appeared on eBay, selling for up to $200 each, according to a news report at the time. Even the cemetery where Mrs. Parks is buried drew accusations from her relatives that it was ghoulishly trying to cash in on her death. 
 The Rosa L. Parks Freedom Chapel, renamed shortly after Ms. Parks was interred there last November, is a small gray stone building that looks more like a one-room schoolhouse than a mausoleum. More than 100 years old, it is near the main gate of the Woodlawn Cemetery on Woodward Avenue, Detroit's noisy and blighted north-south artery. Towering pine and oak trees ring the chapel, isolating it from the car dealerships and strip joints that line nearby streets.
 Inside, past the shiny black granite headstone that marks the entrance to the mausoleum, Mrs. Parks's crypt stands about 10 feet off the ground next to a stained glass window in the chapel's main hall. It is an elegant and demure resting place. It is also quite expensive. 
 Woodlawn, owned by the national cemetery operator Mikocem, started charging a hefty premium for the crypts in the Parks chapel not long after the funeral. For the seven crypts nearest to Mrs. Parks, which fetched $45,000 to $50,000 last year, prices were raised to $60,000. More than three dozen other crypts in the outer hall of the chapel were repriced at $24,275 each as of last April; they had been $17,000 to $20,000 before Mrs. Parks's interment.
 THE cemetery has said it raised the prices to help defray the cost of renovating the chapel and donating Mrs. Parks's crypt. One of the hallway crypts now belongs to Proof, the rap artist who was killed in a gunfight last spring. 
 ''You get to be buried with Auntie Rosa for a price,'' said her nephew, Mr. McCauley, as his voice rose in disgust and frustration. ''We feel like her name is cheapened.''
 So it is that the Parks Institute has allied itself with CMG, which has decided to pursue aggressively Internet interlopers, like cybersquatters, through the courts. Not everyone has fought for domain names successfully: cybersquatters control BruceSpringsteen.com and AlbertEinstein.com. But Mr. Roesler said he hopes that RosaParks.com will soon belong to people who have a claim to Mrs. Parks's legacy.
 The Rosa Park trinkets on eBay -- photographs, pins stamped with her image, the dog tags -- are all unauthorized, Mr. Roesler said. Still, blocking every Parks item on the Internet is neither feasible nor economical. So, sometimes, Mr. Roesler said, you have to let things slide.
 ''Our typical action would be to investigate the use and understand what the use was, and let them know they are infringing on the rights of our client,'' Mr. Roesler said. ''Does that mean we would file a lawsuit? We could.''
 He went on: ''It could be somebody who had very good intentions; it could be somebody who's operating out of their home,'' he said. ''It doesn't do anybody any good to kill a gnat with a sledgehammer.''
 Mr. Roesler said future decisions about the appropriate use of Mrs. Parks's image would take into account whether she is depicted in an appropriate historical context. ''She is a symbol that stands for something,'' Mr. Roesler said. ''We will carefully scrutinize those and see that her intellectual property rights are protected. There will be selected uses that will be allowed.''
 At the Henry Ford Museum, Bus 2857 (which the museum bought from a family in Alabama for about $500,000 in 2001) sits restored and repainted to look much as it did on the day when Mrs. Parks, by refusing to give her seat to a white man, helped set the course of the modern civil rights movement. Visitors pass by seemingly unaware of the lawsuits or the commercial enterprises that are increasingly intertwined with her legacy. 
 Nate Hollis, a 58-year-old from Alabama who runs a second-hand store in Highland Park, Mich., stood next to the bus on a recent afternoon. He said he knew little about infighting between Mrs. Parks's relatives and the overseers of her estate, and said he vaguely knew of the controversies over the use of her name. He said it bothered him, but it did not change who Mrs. Parks was or what she stood for.
 ''She's a national treasure,'' he said. ''And she should be treated like one.''

TOP HONORS -- Many people would be hard pressed to name a famous economist, but the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences will do so -- or at least name an economist (or two) who will instantly become famous -- when it awards the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science (Monday). It will also award this week the Nobel Prize in Literature (Thursday) and the Peace Prize (Friday). 


AUTHOR, AUTHOR -- People who cannot get enough of the dirt swirling around Hewlett-Packard can head to the bookstore for the memoir of Carleton S. Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chairwoman and chief executive (Monday). Although Ms. Fiorina was forced out at Hewlett-Packard, she asserts in her book, ''Tough Choices,'' that she did a very good job there. Some Fiorina-style wisdom from the book jacket: ''In the end business isn't just about numbers; it's about people.''

MANY METRICS -- The main economic news this week will be the report of the trade deficit for August and the release of the Federal Reserve's beige book report, giving the latest snapshot of the economy (Thursday). Other reports are wholesale trade for August (Tuesday); minutes of the Sept. 20 Federal Open Market Committee meeting (Wednesday); and retail sales for September, import prices for September, business inventories for August and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index (Friday).

HOW'D THEY DO? -- The third-quarter earnings season gets under way this week. After a week in which the Dow Jones industrial average reached record highs -- with investors heartened by falling oil prices and the prospect that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates any time soon -- the fresh results from heavyweight players are expected to be the main driver for the markets. Among the major companies that will report this week are Alcoa and Genentech (Tuesday); Gannett and Monsanto (Wednesday); Costco Wholesale, Domino's Pizza, PepsiCo and Yum Brands (Thursday); and General Electric (Friday).

STOCKS, BUT NO BONDS -- The bond market is closed on Monday in observance of the Columbus Day holiday; the stock market is open.

HEADLINE: I. M. Pei in China, Revisiting Roots

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SUZHOU, China, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
For I. M. Pei, the sprawling white stucco museum that opened to great fanfare here this weekend is both a possible swan song and a second chance. 
 The only other building he has ever designed in mainland China, a luxury hotel completed in Beijing in 1982, was a disappointment that he says was rescued only by its beautiful setting in the woods. ''I was saved by the trees,'' he said ruefully in an interview Saturday afternoon.
This time Mr. Pei believes he has succeeded, he said. Returning to his ancestral home 100 miles northwest of Shanghai, he has designed a $40 million building that he hopes will help point the way toward a new type of architecture in the world's fastest-growing economy, a building that is Chinese in spirit yet ultimately modern.
 ''I've never done anything like this before,'' said Mr. Pei, the 89-year-old architect, who was nursing a cold and sipping from a cup of hot water. ''I've used gray and white, which are Suzhou colors. But the form is modern.'' 
 Since retiring in 1990 from his New York firm, Mr. Pei has traveled the world, putting his bright, geometric imprints on buildings in London, Luxembourg, Japan and the Middle East.
 The Suzhou Museum is uniquely personal for him, he said. Although Mr. Pei was born south of here, in Guangzhou, and grew up mostly in Hong Kong and Shanghai, his forebears lived in Suzhou for hundreds of years. And he spent several memorable summers here as a youth. ''My grandfather had a house and a garden here,'' he said. ''I was one of the older grandsons. I should learn about the family business. So I came here three summers. I remember it well.''
 Mr. Pei's father was a prominent banker in pre-Communist China, serving at one time as governor of the country's central bank. Mr. Pei himself left China in 1935 to study architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then Harvard. He did not return for nearly 40 years, when he led a group of American architects on a visit in 1974.
 Later, at the behest of the Chinese government, he returned again to design the luxury hotel in Beijing, in the Fragrant Hills park sector. 
 He said the project was fraught with delays and obstacles, including a shortage of quality materials. ''It was an experience that discouraged me a lot about China,'' he says. ''I didn't think China had a future. The young people didn't work. They just slept on the job.''
 Yet four years ago, when he was asked by the Suzhou government to build a large museum on hallowed ground adjoining a complex of 19th-century historical structures and two gardens listed as Unesco World Heritage sites, Mr. Pei did not hesitate.
 ''I had roots here, and I felt I hadn't done right,'' he said, referring to the Fragrant Hills project. ''I wanted to make amends, or to do something that will have a greater impact on architecture.''
 There were challenges. The museum would sit in the city's historic district, and some traditional houses would have to be moved or destroyed to make way for it, prompting complaints from residents. 
 And although government officials showed Mr. Pei great respect, he said, they also lectured him. While the museum should be modern, they said, it also had to be designed in Suzhou style. ''I asked them how,'' he said, ''and no one knew.''
 Mr. Pei toiled over design concepts that might blend East and West while avoiding some of the failures of the Fragrant Hills project, which was also a mix. He sought to remain true to China's tradition of courtyards and gardens yet rethink those models. He wanted neither a flat Western roof nor the arched gray tile roof typical of Suzhou.
 He found a solution that incorporated the idea of whitewashed walls but eliminated the gray tile roofs, accenting the building instead with gray stone.
 ''Instead of gray tile roofs, I needed something that would develop volumes,'' he said, drawing a diagram on a paper showing an ascending roof pattern. ''So I let the walls climb onto the roof. If the walls were stucco, why not the roof?'' 
 The result is a 160,000-square-foot museum that has many of the hallmarks of Mr. Pei's earlier designs -- his squares, rectangles and pyramids -- as well as an expansive use of glass and light. It also has traditional motifs, like a large Chinese garden with an artificial pond, a Chinese footbridge and a wall of thinly sliced rocks that yields an image of a series of mountain peaks against an older, whitewashed garden wall.
 The timing of the opening was ideal, coinciding with the Mid-Autumn Festival, when the Chinese return home to pay homage to their ancestors and to snack on ''moon cakes.'' To celebrate the opening Mr. Pei invited more than 100 relatives and close friends from around the world, including friends from the art and music worlds. On Friday evening the Suzhou government gave a party for Mr. Pei with a show of traditional Chinese art and music, and on Saturday Mr. Pei held his own private party, a night of music, dance and fireworks.
 When the museum finally opened to the public Saturday morning, unruly throngs pressed in a mad rush to see the new design. When one visitor was asked to leave, she pushed past four guards with her camera, shouting: ''I haven't seen the garden. I bought a ticket. I'm going to see that garden.'' The scene was similar on Sunday.
 Suzhou was a major cultural center during the Ming and Qing dynasties, and the museum houses relics from those periods, including jade, porcelain, calligraphy and paintings. Also on view is a special exhibition of works by three contemporary artists, Xu Bing, Cai Guoqiang and Zhao Wuji, all of whom left China to study or create away from home, just as Mr. Pei did.
 Since he left his architectural practice in 1990, Mr. Pei said, he has accepted only commissions outside the United States, largely because of his experience in designing the addition to the Louvre in Paris, with its famed glass pyramid. ''That project taught me that to know a country you have to work there on a project of consequence,'' he said. ''So after that project I told myself, 'Let's learn about the world.' ''
 With his Suzhou Museum design, Mr. Pei said, he hopes to encourage and even inspire China, which is in the midst of a frantic building boom, to consider its own rich traditions, to be neither a slave to the past nor an weak imitator of the West.
 Looking out from the 48th-floor lounge in the Shangri-La Hotel toward a series of huge real estate projects -- row after row of what might be considered Chinese versions of Levittown -- Mr. Pei said: ''Terrible things are happening. I can't stop it. I can't stop progress. But I hope it will be temporary.''
 He said he hoped that in time the country would find its own path.
 In China, ''architecture and the garden are one,'' he said. ''A Western building is a building, and a garden is a garden. They're related in spirit. But they are one in China.'' 
 As for whether the museum is his final project, Mr. Pei said: ''Never predict the future. If you ask my wife, she'll say that's it. But if you ask me, I'm not sure it's the end. There are always challenges in life.''

HEADLINE: Saving the Middle Class

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 An Oct. 4 letter says New York City ''must quickly develop a plan to retain the middle-class population.'' The city can start by abolishing rent control. 
By decreasing the profitability of supplying units occupied by renters, these controls spawn condo conversions and prompt builders to construct fewer rental units and more units for sale to owner-occupiers. People who can't afford to buy housing are unnecessarily disadvantaged. 
 Rent control also encourages empty nesters, who enjoy below-market rents for their three- and four-bedroom apartments, to stay put rather than move into smaller units, thus discouraging younger families with children from moving to the city.

HEADLINE: Toxic Waste And the Poor

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Your editorial ''An African Dumping Ground'' (Oct. 4) and Bob Herbert's column ''Poisoned on Eno Road'' (Oct. 2) demonstrate the universality of dumping hazardous waste on poor, minority and disenfranchised people. 
The hazardous waste dumped in a landfill on Eno Road in Dickson County, Tennessee, has migrated underground for two miles. Wells and groundwater will be poisoned for hundreds of years. We must not continue to allow seemingly benign chemicals like flame retardants to be marketed without accountability for the invasion of our bodies and environment.
 This is particularly true when minority and poor people are invariably the primary victims, and governments have proven ill equipped to prevent such pollution or to clean it up.

To the Editor:
 As a former organizer in the ''cancer alley'' of Lake Charles, La., I know all too well our nation's legacy of environmental injustice, as described by Bob Herbert. As we attempt to undo past wrongs, let's not neglect any opportunity to do positive good for poor communities affected by toxic waste and neglect. 
 Our nation is on the threshold of an energy revolution that will replace old polluting technologies with clean, homegrown alternatives. Clean energy independence will come much faster and with greater public support if we commit now to prepare unemployed and underemployed workers for good, family-supporting jobs in the new energy economy. 
 With the right political leadership, we can create good jobs weatherizing homes and businesses, installing wind turbines and solar systems, and building next-generation, fuel-efficient cars and trucks. That way, we can turn the environmental injustice of the past into the environmental and economic justice of the future.

HEADLINE: Looking Over the Wall

 BODY:
Congress has adjourned to plead for its re-election, having bequeathed to the nation a giant fence-building project as its official strategy for fixing the immigration problem. No doubt some voters will be reassured by the idea that covering 700 miles of the 2,000-mile southwestern border with razor wire and floodlights will solve this thing once and for all. But many others will continue to suspect that it is more complicated than that. 
 With a better start, this election year could have featured a rational debate about immigration policy that went beyond xenophobia and the fear of disorder caused by the presence of immigrant day laborers on suburban street corners. Americans -- particularly those struggling to find decent jobs themselves -- have a reasonable concern about what effect the presence of so many unplanned-for workers has had on the economy. They deserved to hear that talked about in a realistic way.
 Last month the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that wants to reduce immigration, released a study that found that a sharp immigration increase in the last five years corresponded with a steep decline in the employment of young native-born Americans, particularly black men without high school diplomas. Last week in The Times, Rachel Swarns reported on the ways the booming population of Latinos in the Deep South -- particularly Georgia -- had left many black Americans resentful of the immigrants' comparative success. 
 But there is compelling evidence that instead of harming the economy, unskilled immigrants prop it up, filling jobs that better-educated Americans do not want and giving everyone access to cheaper goods and services. The case made by the Center for Immigration Studies is rebutted by other studies that have found that there is no nationwide pattern of job displacement by illegal immigrants, and that immigration has broadly been a net plus to the nation. In Georgia, immigrant labor has kept textile mills, farms and service industries humming. 
 Right now across America, fruit is rotting on the ground because the crackdown along the border has created a shortage of immigrant workers needed for the harvest. Nevertheless, it is impossible to ignore stories of poor American workers who believe that their livelihoods were undermined by immigrants willing to work for below-subsistence wages, and of honest employers who could not compete with unscrupulous competitors using undocumented workers. 
 These serious problems will not be solved at the border with Mexico. Setting things right means adopting policies that fence-obsessed members of Congress have not exactly championed, like raising the minimum wage, improving public education, having a progressive income tax and making sure that workers' rights are protected.
 These are only a few reasonable solutions. A host of others is offered in a new report by the Migration Policy Institute, in which Lee Hamilton, the former congressman, and Spencer Abraham, the former senator and energy secretary, argue that immigration needs to be seen as an integral element of a national economic policy. It is a resource to be embraced and managed, with a lawful, orderly flow of workers governed by flexible quotas set by a national commission advising Congress.
 It's a comprehensive approach and then some. It offers a new way of framing a stalled debate. The wall builders have made their point, and it's a lousy one. Now it is time for those who want serious immigration reform to look beyond them.

HEADLINE: Cash With A Catch

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
A program that has shown promise in changing the behavior of desperately poor people in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Nicaragua is about to get a tryout in New York City, a place that has always had deep rivers of poverty flowing beneath its glittering surface.
 New York has eight million people, and 1.5 million of them are poor. One-third of all children under 5 in the city are poor. 
The federal government's attitude toward the poor in recent years has ranged from indifferent to hostile. Poor kids can be useful as campaign props at election time, but otherwise are expected to remain silent and invisible.
 Municipal governments are hardly equipped to deal with a problem as enormous and deeply embedded as poverty. But to his credit, the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, has directed his aides to roll up their sleeves and do whatever it takes to develop a workable plan for reducing poverty in the city.
 He has said, ''Until we marshal the best efforts of our public and private sectors to help more of [the poor] transform their lives, this will not be the city it can be, or that we want it to be.''
 One of the programs in the works, known as conditional cash transfers, is new to the United States. Hard cash is given by the government to poor families, but the transfers are contingent upon improvements in certain kinds of behavior. Where it has been tried in other countries, families with children would typically agree to enroll the youngsters in school, or improve their attendance, or take them for regular medical checkups.
 The goal of the transfers is to provide immediate cash assistance to the poor while at the same time countering the self-defeating notions and activities that tend to hold people in poverty, sometimes for generations. 
 The amount of money involved varies from program to program. But some of the poorest families have been able to double their incomes with the transfers. Studies looking back over the past few years have shown solid evidence that the transfers have led to significant improvements in the habits and decision-making of participants.
 ''There's often a requirement that mothers go to workshops that cover a range of issues -- for example, health and hygiene and child care,'' said Laura Rawlings, a senior specialist at the World Bank, who compiled an extensive report on the transfers. ''One of the aims of these programs is to make long-term investments that benefit future generations.''
 The question facing the Bloomberg administration, as it develops a pilot project, is how to craft a variation that is suitable for a family in New York that is poor but is not facing the subsistence-level crises that might confront, say, a rural household in Colombia.
 Where young children are involved, the primary concerns here, as elsewhere, will center on the parents' attitudes and behavior with regard to schooling and health. But Linda Gibbs, the deputy mayor for health and human services, said the city would also be looking to see if this system of cash rewards could be used to encourage adolescents to remain in school, and to bolster work habits and the development of employable skills among the working poor.
 The longest-running large-scale cash transfer programs are in Mexico, which established a system of cash rewards in 1997. Ms. Gibbs said studies of the Mexican experience have shown that constructive changes in the behavior of participants far outlasted the receipt of money from the programs. 
 However worthy an experiment, there remains the matter of how to pay for this. Mayor Bloomberg is planning to raise all of the money for the pilot project from private sources -- foundations, corporations, private donors and so on. If the pilot project is successful, the start-up costs for a full-scale program would be formidable, and would require public funding.
 Last month, when he announced the findings of his Commission for Economic Opportunity, Mr. Bloomberg said:
 ''For too long, this widespread poverty has been regarded as a troubling but inevitable condition of life in our city. But time and again -- in reducing crime, reforming our schools, reviving our economy, and in other areas -- New Yorkers have shown that we can devise realistic solutions to even the toughest problems.''
 We haven't much to lose. In an era of almost criminal indifference to the plight of the have-nots, the mayor's antipoverty efforts are, at the very least, a sign that the forces in support of the poor have not been completely routed.

PERSON: David G. Salten

HEADLINE: David G. Salten, 93, Expert on School Desegregation, Dies

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
David G. Salten, an innovative and influential educator who devised a desegregation plan for the New Rochelle, N.Y., school system and, as an expert witness in 1958, urged the immediate opening of the newly integrated schools in Little Rock, Ark., died on Oct. 1 at his home in Port Washington, N.Y. He was 93.
 The cause was a disease of the heart muscle, said his wife, Adrienne O'Brien. 
Dr. Salten began as a teacher in New York City, rose to acting principal and then was superintendent at two suburban school systems, Long Beach, N.Y., and New Rochelle. His wide-ranging career included service on state, federal and global commissions and study groups on education; a top economic development post in Nassau County; and a leadership role in Jewish philanthropies. 
 Until his death, he was a consultant to the president of Hofstra University, and he had been an executive vice president and provost of New York Institute of Technology for more than 20 years.
 Over the years, Dr. Salten consistently pushed for more effective forms of school financing, better compensation for teachers and improved vocational training.
 David George Salten was born on Aug. 23, 1913, in Manhattan. He went to city schools and earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from New York University and a master's in psychology from Columbia. 
 His first job in education was as a science teacher at Metropolitan Vocational High School, where he rose to chairman of the science department and then acting principal. He earned a doctorate from N.Y.U. while working at the school.
 As acting principal, Dr. Salten obtained the Liberty ship John W. Brown, a World War II cargo vessel, which the school used from 1946 to 1982 to train students for maritime careers. He also acquired an old public school on West 46th Street as an annex to his high school. It soon became the first home of the School of Performing Arts.
 In 1950, he became one of the youngest school superintendents in the state when he was appointed to head the Long Beach schools. 
 Dr. Salten ran afoul of local politicians, particularly because of his opposition to building a new school on a site that was sometimes under water. After the school board voted 3 to 2 to fire him in December 1961, New Rochelle hired him as superintendent in 1962. 
 At the time, the federal government was ordering that the city's schools be desegregated. Dr. Salten devised a tougher plan, which involved shutting an elementary school and busing students, and the Justice Department approved it.
 As a result of Dr. Salten's frequent consulting on educational issues, he was asked to testify in desegregation cases. 
 In 1958, he appeared as an expert witness in federal court for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Little Rock, to argue against the local school board's request to delay court-ordered integration for two and a half years.
 ''When certain types of surgery have to be done, it should be done quickly,'' he said, according to The Associated Press.
 Judge Harry J. Lemley of United States District Court granted the delay, but his judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis, and then by the Supreme Court. 
 Dr. Salten resigned from his New Rochelle job in 1965 to become executive director of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, a position he held for four years. 
 Dr. Salten's marriage to the former Frances Claire Brown ended in divorce in 1983. In addition to Ms. O'Brien, his wife, he is survived by three daughters from his first marriage, Phoebe Salten of Providence, R.I., Cynthia Salten of Boston, and Melissa Salten Rothman of Manhattan; 8 grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Where Faith Abides, Employees Have Few Rights

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES; Andrew Lehren conducted computer analysis for this series, and Donna Anderson provided online research assistance.

 BODY:
J. Jeffrey Heck, a lawyer in Mansfield, Ohio, usually sits on management's side of the table. ''The only employee cases I take are those that poke my buttons,'' he said. ''And this one really did.''
 His client was a middle-aged novice training to become a nun in a Roman Catholic religious order in Toledo. She said she had been dismissed by the order after she became seriously ill -- including a diagnosis of breast cancer.
In her complaint, the novice, Mary Rosati, said she had visited her doctor with her immediate supervisor and the mother superior. After the doctor explained her treatment options for breast cancer, the complaint continued, the mother superior announced: ''We will have to let her go. I don't think we can take care of her.'' 
 Some months later Ms. Rosati was told that the mother superior and the order's governing council had decided to dismiss her after concluding that ''she was not called to our way of life,'' according to the complaint. Along with her occupation and her home, she lost her health insurance, Mr. Heck said. Ms. Rosati, who still lacks health insurance but whose cancer is in remission, said she preferred not to discuss her experience because of her continuing love for the church. 
 In court filings, lawyers for the diocese denied her account of these events. If Ms. Rosati had worked for a business or almost any secular employer, she might have prevailed under the protections of the Americans With Disabilities Act. Instead, her complaint was dismissed in December 2002 by Judge James G. Carr of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, who decided that the order's decision to dismiss her ''was an ecclesiastical decision'' that was ''beyond the reach of the court'' because ''the First Amendment requires churches to be free from government interference in matters of church governance and administration.'' 
 Legislators and regulators are not the only people in government who have drafted special rules for religious organizations. Judges, too, have carved out or preserved safe havens that shield religious employers of all faiths from most employee lawsuits, from laws protecting pensions and providing unemployment benefits, and from laws that give employees the right to form unions to negotiate with their employers. 
 Some of these exemptions are rooted in long traditions, while others have grown from court decisions over the last 15 years. Together, they are expanding the ability of religious organizations -- especially religious schools -- to manage their affairs with less interference from the government and their own employees.
 The most sweeping of these judicial protections, and the one that confronted the novice nun in Toledo, is called the ministerial exception. Judges have been applying this exception, sometimes called the church autonomy doctrine, to religious employment disputes for more than 100 years. 
 As a rule, state and federal judges will handle any lawsuit that is filed in the right place in an appropriate, timely manner. But judges will almost never agree to hear a controversy that would require them to delve into the doctrines, governance, discipline or hiring preferences of any religious faith. Citing the protections of the First Amendment, they have ruled with great consistency that congregations cannot fully express their faith and exercise their religious freedom unless they are free to select their own spiritual leaders without any interference from government agencies or second-guessing by the courts. 
 To do otherwise would be an intolerable government intrusion into employment relationships that courts have called ''the lifeblood'' of religious life and the bedrock of religious liberty, explained Edward R. McNicholas, co-chairman of the national religious institutions practice in the Washington, D.C., office of Sidley Austin, a law firm with some of the country's largest religious organizations among its clients.
 Judges have routinely invoked the ministerial exception to dismiss lawsuits against religious employers by rabbis, ministers, cantors, nuns and priests -- those ''whose ministry is a core expression of religious belief for that congregation,'' as Mr. McNicholas put it.
 But judges also have applied the exception to dismiss cases filed by the press secretary at a Roman Catholic church, a writer for The Christian Science Monitor, administrators at religious colleges, the disgruntled beneficiaries of a Lutheran pension fund, the overseer of the kosher kitchen at a Jewish nursing home and a co-founder of Focus on the Family, run by the conservative religious leader James C. Dobson. Court files show that some of these people were surprised to learn that their work had been considered a ''core expression of religious belief'' by their employer.
 Religious employers have long been shielded from all complaints of religious discrimination by an exemption that was built into the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and expanded in 1972. That historic exemption allows them to give preference in hiring to candidates who share their faith. In recent years, some judges have also refused to interfere when religious groups have dismissed lesbians, unwed mothers and adulterous couples, even if they profess the same faith, because they have violated their employers' religious codes.
 A federal court decision has given religious broadcasters an exemption from some of the fair-hiring requirements of the Federal Communications Commission, even when they are hiring secretaries and receptionists. Two other decisions, one in federal court affecting a Mormon church and the other in a state court of appeals case involving a Roman Catholic nursing home, affirmed the right of religious employers to dismiss employees whose faith changed after they were hired.
 ''These are very difficult cases because they pull at some very fundamental heartstrings,'' said Steven C. Sheinberg, a lawyer at Outten & Golden, specializing in employment law. ''There's our belief that employees should be free of discrimination in their work, versus our belief that religious organizations should be free to hire people who best help them fulfill their religious mission, without the intrusion of government.''
 Employees at religious institutions face other risks as well, thanks to pension law exemptions granted by Congress and upheld by the courts. Religious employers are exempt from Erisa, the federal pension law that establishes disclosure requirements and conflict-of-interest restrictions for employee pension plans. That exemption has given rise to several cases in which workers at religious hospitals found that their pensions had vanished because of practices that would not have been allowed under Erisa's rules.
 A related exemption frees religious employers from participating in the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the government-run insurance program that provides a safety net for corporate pension plans. And some significant court decisions in labor disputes in the last several years have made it easier for religious schools and colleges to resist collective bargaining efforts. 
 But for Mr. Heck, the question of whether these workplace exemptions are fair to religious employees was crystallized by the case of Ms. Rosati, the novice nun in Toledo.
 He said the doctor involved in her case had been prepared to testify under oath on Ms. Rosati's behalf. The doctor ''had quite a vivid memory about these events.'' In fact, Mr. Heck said, the doctor had cautioned the nuns who accompanied Ms. Rosati that it would be virtually impossible for the ailing novice to get affordable insurance anywhere else if she were dropped from the diocesan health.
 Lawyers for the diocese disputed Ms. Rosati's account of that visit and denied that health reasons were the causes of her rejection by the order, the Sisters of the Visitation of Holy Mary, which is covered by the diocesan health plan. For the court ''to even begin to inquire into that decision-making process, we believe, crosses the line set by the First Amendment,'' said Gregory T. Lodge, a lawyer for both the Toledo diocese and the order, which operates under papal authority.
 ''I understand and absolutely appreciate that in matters of religion, the state has no business meddling,'' Mr. Heck said. ''It would be unthinkable for a judge to be able to say, 'Hey, I don't like the way you're interpreting the Book of Luke.' ''
 But what religious principle is offended when an employee simply grows old or becomes ill, he asked. If the answer is ''none,'' he continued, judges should be more willing to ''look behind the curtain.''

Exemptions From Employee Suits
 For 28 days last May, Lynette M. Petruska, a former nun who now lives in St. Louis, thought she had finally found judges willing to listen to her complaint against Gannon University, a coeducational Catholic college in downtown Erie, Pa. As it turned out, she was wrong.
 Ms. Petruska was educated in Catholic schools from kindergarten to college commencement, graduated at the top of her law school class and practiced law for several years before deciding to become a nun. In 1999, as she was working toward taking her final vows, she became the first woman to serve as Gannon's chaplain.
 Three years later she was demoted and, according to her complaint, effectively forced out. In her lawsuit, she said this action was in response to her having notified the administration of a case of sexual misconduct by a senior university official, resisted efforts to cover up that case and opposed proposals to weaken campus policies on sexual harassment. In 2004, she sued, accusing the university administration of forcing her out simply because she was a woman and because she had opposed the sexual harassment others experienced on campus.
 Gender bias claims against religious employers have generally been dismissed under the ministerial exception. But some judges across the country have been less quick to dismiss cases where sexual harassment or abuse of an employee is involved. And unlike many other plaintiffs, Ms. Petruska claimed that her supervisor had actually acknowledged to her that she was being demoted solely because of her sex, not because of any religious doctrine.
 Judge Sean J. McLaughlin of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania nevertheless ruled that Gannon was protected by the First Amendment and the ministerial exception from any court interference in its choice of chaplain. Gannon itself argued that it had many women in leadership positions and that Ms. Petruska had resigned simply because she was unhappy with a staff reorganization. But its fundamental argument was that it would be unconstitutional for the court to second-guess these disputed decisions.
 ''You may ask, 'Why should these decisions go unquestioned?' The reason is plain and simple: The First Amendment protects a church's right to freely exercise its religion,'' said Evan C. Rudert, a lawyer for the university. ''And that includes organizing itself as it chooses and selecting those who it believes will serve best as its leaders -- without interference from the courts.''
 Then, last May, in a decision that caused considerable comment in legal circles around the country, a federal appeals court panel reversed the trial judge's decision.
 For four weeks, the prevailing law in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and the Virgin Islands -- the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit -- was that ''employment discrimination unconnected to religious belief, religious doctrine, or the internal regulations of a church is simply the exercise of intolerance, not the free exercise of religion.'' 
 Appellate Judge Edward R. Becker wrote that opinion; his colleague on the three-judge panel, Judge D. Brooks Smith, filed a stinging dissent. A few days later, Judge Becker died. On June 20, in a rare move, the Third Circuit granted Gannon's routine request to have the case reconsidered and named Judge Smith to the new three-judge panel that would do so.
 On Sept. 6, the new panel swept the earlier decision away, unequivocally restoring the protections for religious employers that it had put in doubt. As Judge Smith put it, the ministerial exception ''applies to any claim, the resolution of which would limit a religious institution's right to choose who will perform particular spiritual functions.''
 Ms. Petruska, who has left her order and returned home to work at her old law firm, describes herself as a feminist who is ''committed to peace and freedom.'' She has a long history of putting her words into action -- she has been arrested at protest marches, most recently at an antiwar rally the day before the Iraq war began, she said. She plans to appeal the ruling against her. 
 ''I think this issue needs to be decided by the Supreme Court,'' she said. And she has hopes that the justices will agree with Judge Becker that, absent some grounding in religious doctrine, sex discrimination by religious employers is wrong.

No Recourse On Age Bias
 Add age discrimination to that wish list, the Rev. John Paul Hankins says.
 At 73, Mr. Hankins can look back on 50 years in a loving marriage, 40 years as a minister in the United Methodist Church -- and 3 years as the plaintiff in an uphill court fight over his denomination's mandatory retirement policy.
 Eight months after he turned 70, that policy forced Mr. Hankins to leave his pulpit in the historic Stony Brook Community Church in Stony Brook, N.Y., where he had served for 37 years. He loved his flock and the feeling was mutual: the congregation withheld part of its annual contribution to the regional church that year to express its dismay.
 ''He had served for many, many years and wanted to continue to serve, and his congregation wanted that, too,'' said David S. Warren, a professor of computer science at Stony Brook University who had been a member of the congregation for more than 25 years but who left because of how Mr. Hankins was treated. 
 Mr. Hankins said he was suing because age discrimination is almost as hateful and senseless to him as the racial segregation and bias against women that used to be ''mandatory policies'' of his church.
 ''I feel, and have long felt, that discrimination in any form has no place in the life of a faith community,'' he said. 
 Under the federal age discrimination law, most employees of all but the smallest businesses can sue if they are forced to retire for no other reason than that they reached a certain birthday; increasingly, government and academic employees have the same protection. But Mr. Hankins knows his complaint will probably never come to trial simply because he is a clergy member trying to sue his church. Indeed, court rulings around the country suggest that if he had been forced out at any age and for almost any reason -- for a deceptive reason, or even for no reason at all -- he would face the same judicial roadblock. 
 ''I never, ever thought that the last years of my ministry would be involved in a fight like this,'' Mr. Hankins said. 
 Lawrence H. McGaughey, the lawyer for the regional Methodist governing body and its bishop, acknowledged that there is a movement in the church to eliminate the retirement rule opposed by Rev. Hankins. But if the rule is ultimately changed, it should be the church's decision, not a court's, he said.
 ''Any private employer would feel the same way -- they'd like to be able to make these decisions without having to face the courts,'' Mr. McGaughey said. ''But the difference is the First Amendment.''
 He continued: ''We're talking about worship here. Are you going to go into church and have someone standing there who was ordered to be there by the courts? There are certain things a government just cannot do in this country.''
 In September 2003, a federal trial judge on Long Island ruled that Mr. Hankins's complaint was barred by the ministerial exception. Last February, a federal appeals court panel sent the case back, directing the trial judge to decide the case by applying a 1993 federal law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, rather than the ministerial exception doctrine. But there was little in the instructions to the trial court to encourage Mr. Hankins. 
 He nevertheless thinks his complaint will eventually help his church see that its mandatory retirement rule is unfair. 
 ''I don't need to win the case,'' Mr. Hankins said. ''I feel the movement of history at work here, I really do. Ideas find their feet, and start to walk.''
 State judges have been equally reluctant to interfere in disputes between religious employers and their staff members -- to the sad frustration of Rabbi Isaac H. Celnik of Albuquerque.
 Rabbi Celnik, one of the youngest men ever ordained in Conservative Judaism, was just 30 when he was hired in 1971 as the spiritual leader of Congregation B'nai Israel. Eight years later, he entered into a 30-year contract with the synagogue, an arrangement his congregation endorsed by a margin of almost nine to one, he said.
 Then the medical problems began. In 1996, Rabbi Celnik was told he was in the early stages of Parkinson's disease; in April 2000, his wife, Peggy, was told she had breast cancer. In October 2000, he said, the president of the congregation's governing board at the time suggested he retire on disability.
 But the rabbi did not consider himself disabled and did not want to retire, he said. He had two young children and a wife whose treatment required continuing health insurance. He ''loved the work, and loved the congregation,'' he said. Indeed, when the synagogue's cantor resigned a month after the retirement discussion, Rabbi Celnik proposed, and the board agreed, that he would take on the cantor's duties as well, he said.
 But the relationship deteriorated as he tried to negotiate retirement terms that would provide him and his family with adequate financial security. In January 2002, after those negotiations faltered, he was dismissed; in 2003, he sued. But last February, the state's court of appeals dismissed his case, based on the ministerial exception, also called the church autonomy doctrine.
 ''We are sympathetic to Rabbi Celnik's struggles with Parkinson's and the manifestation of the disease after so many years of service,'' the chief judge wrote. But he ruled that the dispute ''is precisely the type of religious debate that the church autonomy doctrine is intended to protect from judicial review.''
 The congregation's current president, Alan M. Chodorow, declined to discuss the details of the dispute. ''I do not want to talk about anything that might impair our search for reconciliation and forgiveness'' with Rabbi Celnik, he said. ''But I will say that we believe strongly in the separation of church and state, and that the state should not have any part in choosing our spiritual leaders.''
 But Mr. Chodorow said that he was sympathetic to the situation that this freedom for congregations created for employees and that he believed that religious institutions have to provide other protections by contract. Although clergy members in many faiths work without formal contracts, the model contract in wide use within Conservative Judaism provides that rabbis and cantors can terminate the agreement without cause and seek binding arbitration to resolve disputes, he said.
 The church autonomy doctrine ''takes away certain rights and this is put in specifically for the purpose of preserving rights,'' Mr. Chodorow said.
 Rabbi Celnik and his wife continue to struggle with the financial and physical burdens of his deteriorating health and her second episode of cancer. ''They don't teach this in rabbinical school,'' the rabbi said in a recent interview. Teach what? Mrs. Celnik answered before he could: ''Don't get old. Don't get sick.''
 Mr. McNicholas, the Sidley Austin lawyer, acknowledged that some ''unjust and sinful'' treatment has been protected from litigation by the ministerial exception. But he argued that ''the openness of the religious process'' would remedy those situations, making it possible for a clergy member dismissed by one congregation to find a home in another.
 But what if they are sick? ''That's harder -- and very troubling,'' Mr. McNicholas said. ''But if you have a judge deciding it, that's just too much intervention in the process of deciding the hiring issues'' at religious institutions. ''There's no easy answer.''

Protections Against Unionization
 The University of Great Falls, in Montana, has a tidy urban campus, a bold crucifix-topped chapel, a master's program in criminal justice and, according to one student's Internet posting, a cafeteria that serves pretty good spaghetti.
 What the small Roman Catholic college doesn't have is a faculty union.
 It wasn't for lack of trying. In 1995, the Montana Federation of Teachers, which had unionized most of the public universities in Montana, asked the National Labor Relations Board to recognize it as the collective bargaining agent for the teaching staff at Great Falls.
 ''Some of the faculty members there traveled in circles that included professors at the other schools,'' recalled James McGarvey, who was president of the Montana Federation of Teachers at the time. (It has since merged with the Montana Education Association.) Teachers at those other campuses had better pay and more favorable work rules, and some professors at Great Falls had expressed interest in seeing whether the federation could help them as well, according to Mr. McGarvey. ''We felt we had a pretty strong showing,'' he said.
 J. C. Weingartner, a union lawyer who worked on the campaign, said that while ''pay did come into it, it wasn't what got it started.'' That spark was discontent among some professors over the president's appointing members to an important advisory council who ''did not reflect the views of the majority of the faculty'' in negotiations with the administration, he said. ''So they felt their interests would be better served with collective bargaining.''
 The university, which has a new management team today, declined to comment on the long legal battle.
 But when the labor board held a hearing on the union's request, the university's lawyers argued that the board had no jurisdiction because the university was a religious institution, and to force it to negotiate with the union would violate its religious liberty.
 The university based its case largely on a 1979 decision in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that the labor board's jurisdiction did not extend to religious schools. After that decision, which resulted in what is called the Catholic Bishop doctrine, the board began case-by-case examinations to determine whether the schools that came before it were sufficiently religious -- whatever their faith -- to be exempt from its jurisdiction.
 The University of Great Falls did not qualify, the board concluded in February 1996.
 For the next seven years, the little Catholic college fought both the federal labor board and the faculty union, keeping lots of lawyers busy and incurring official charges of unfair labor practices in the process. In 2002, it won.
 The federal appeals court panel in Washington ruled that a three-prong test should be the labor board's only standard for determining which schools were religious enough to be exempt from the nation's collective bargaining laws under the Catholic Bishop decision.
 Any school that is nonprofit, has a religious affiliation and presents itself to the public as a religious institution must be exempted from jurisdiction, the court said. And that included the University of Great Falls.
 And the court ruled that the labor board's old case-by-case approach had to stop immediately. For the board even to conduct such inquiries raised serious issues of religious freedom, the judges said.
 Of course, some casually faithful or broadly tolerant schools that might previously have failed to win a labor board exemption would easily pass the court's new test.
 The appellate judges anticipated that complaint, and dismissed it. ''If the university is ecumenical and open-minded, that does not make it any less religious, nor N.L.R.B. interference any less a potential infringement of religious liberty,'' they said.
 David Strom, general counsel of the American Federation of Teachers in Washington, doesn't mince words about the impact of the Great Falls decision. ''It means that the difficulty of organizing a religiously affiliated college has become enormous.''
 Although federal statistics show that one of every seven colleges in the country describes itself as a religious institution, it is not clear how far-reaching the Great Falls decision will be. On its face, it would seem likely to reduce any union-driven salary pressures on exempt religious schools, allowing them to maintain more competitive tuition levels. However, some colleges that might be eligible for an exemption under the new rules may already have collective bargaining in place or may not oppose unions as fiercely as the Montana university did.
 And the decision limits only the protections of the National Labor Relations Act. But last fall, in a case involving teachers at Catholic schools in Boston, a federal district judge in Massachusetts ruled that part of another federal labor statute called the Taft-Hartley Act could not be applied to church-operated schools without raising First Amendment issues.
 Notwithstanding the protracted battle in Great Falls, Catholic institutions are not doctrinally opposed to collective bargaining, said Julie N. Secviar, senior vice president for strategic resources for the Franciscan Sisters of Chicago Service Corporation, which manages Catholic hospitals, nursing homes and retirement communities.
 In fact, the ethical health care directives of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops require ''recognition of the rights of employees to organize and bargain collectively without prejudice to the common good.'' 

Next, Exemptions for Hospitals?
 At the other end of the spectrum stand the Seventh Day Adventists, a Christian denomination with more than 14 million members worldwide. Like many denominations, it provides global humanitarian relief and maintains a large network of church schools and colleges, including Loma Linda University in California. But it also operates the largest Protestant nonprofit health care system in the country, with 38 hospitals in 10 states, 23 nursing homes and 44,000 employees.
 And not one of those employees is in a union, for a very simple reason: The church believes that collective bargaining ''defies Christ's admonitions that behavior must be directed by individual conscience'' and ''is inherently disruptive'' of the church's healing mission, as lawyers for the denomination first explained to the national labor board in 1998.
 The lawyers were responding to a petition by the California Nurses Association to represent the nonsupervisory nurses employed at Ukiah Valley Medical Center.
 As in the Great Falls case, the lawyers argued that the labor board had no jurisdiction because the hospital was a religious institution and to force it to recognize or bargain with a union would violate its freedom under the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
 As in the Great Falls case, the labor board ruled otherwise. The next step should have been union balloting, explained Jeffrey A. Berman, the Sidley Austin lawyer who represented the hospital in the case. But the nursing association withdrew its petition and the case ended, he said.
 According to the American Hospital Association, about one of every four of its members has a religious affiliation. But the Adventists' problem before the labor board was that hospitals, unlike religious schools, were specifically included in the board's jurisdiction by Congress. The only labor-law accommodation that Adventists have been able to win from Congress was a provision in 1974 allowing church members to pay the equivalent of their union dues to one of several agreed-upon secular charities, according to Mr. Berman.
 Adventist hospitals are still waiting for their own Great Falls moment. As Mr. Berman put it, ''We're not asking for carte blanche, for the ability to be exempt from all laws -- just with respect to what is unique about these hospitals.''

A front-page article on Oct. 9 about the regulatory and legal exemptions available to religious employers referred incorrectly to a sequence of events involving the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in its handling of Petruska v. Gannon University, concerning a Catholic university chaplain's complaint of sex discrimination. The original majority opinion in the case, written by Judge Edward R. Becker, was formally issued several days after Judge Becker's death in May, not before.

HEADLINE: Evangelicals Blame Foley, Not Republican Party 

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: VIRGINIA BEACH, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
As word of Representative Mark Foley's sexually explicit e-mail messages to former pages spread last week, Republican strategists worried -- and Democrats hoped -- that the sordid nature of the scandal would discourage conservative Christians from going to the polls.
 But in dozens of interviews here in southeastern Virginia, a conservative Christian stronghold that is a battleground in races for the House and Senate, many said the episode only reinforced their reasons to vote for their two Republican incumbents in neck-and-neck re-election fights, Representative Thelma Drake and Senator George Allen.
''This is Foley's lifestyle,'' said Ron Gwaltney, a home builder, as he waited with his family outside a Christian rock concert last Thursday in Norfolk. ''He tried to keep it quiet from his family and his voters. He is responsible for what he did. He is paying a price for what he did. I am not sure how much farther it needs to go.'' 
 The Democratic Party is ''the party that is tolerant of, maybe more so than Republicans, that lifestyle,'' Mr. Gwaltney said, referring to homosexuality. 
 Most of the evangelical Christians interviewed said that so far they saw Mr. Foley's behavior as a matter of personal morality, not institutional dysfunction. 
 All said the question of broader responsibility had quickly devolved into a storm of partisan charges and countercharges. And all insisted the episode would have little impact on their intentions to vote.
 It is too soon to tell if the scandal will affect the turnout of evangelical Christians, who make up about a quarter of the electorate and more than a third of Republican voters. Some of President Bush's political advisers have said that pre-election reports in 2000 that Mr. Bush was once arrested for drunken driving depressed turnout among conservative Christians, nearly costing him the White House. 
 Pollsters and conservative leaders have said for months that grass-roots evangelicals were demoralized by what they felt was the Republicans' failure to live up to their talk about social issues -- to say nothing of the economy, the Iraq war and other issues that weigh more broadly across the electorate. A recent poll by the Pew Research Center showed a steep drop in conservative Christian support for Republicans, albeit without a corresponding gain for the Democrats.
 Some in the crowd waiting outside the concert, by the evangelical group MercyMe, said the revelations about Mr. Foley, Republican of Florida, had redoubled their previous concerns about the Republican Party.
 ''The Republicans need to tighten up their ship,'' said Wade Crane, a sign maker from Virginia Beach who said he usually voted Republican but had soured on the party in the last several months. ''They need to stop covering themselves, using their power to protect themselves.'' 
 Charles W. Dunn, dean of the school of government at Regent University, founded here by the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson, said that so many conservative Christians were already in a funk about the party that ''the Foley issue just opens up the potential floodgate for losses.'' The tawdry accusations, Mr. Dunn said, ''give life'' to the charges of Republican corruption that had been merely ''latent'' in the minds of many voters.
 But as far as culpability in the Foley case, Mr. Dunn said, House Republicans may benefit from the evangelical conception of sin. Where liberals tend to think of collective responsibility, conservative Christians focus on personal morality. ''The conservative Christian audience or base has this acute moral lens through which they look at this, and it is very personal,'' Mr. Dunn said. ''This is Foley's personal sin.''
 To a person, those interviewed said that Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois should resign if he knew of the most serious claims against Mr. Foley and failed to stop him. They said the degree of Mr. Hastert's responsibility remained to be seen. Many said the issue had not changed their view of Congress because, in their opinion, it could not sink any lower. 
 But all also noted that the swift Democratic efforts to broaden the scandal to Mr. Hastert and other Republicans had added more than a whiff of partisanship to the stink of the scandal. 
 As the details were emerging last Tuesday, for example, Phil Kellam, the Democrat challenging Ms. Drake, called on her to demand Mr. Hastert's immediate resignation. In a statement, Mr. Kellam said the House Republican leaders' ''lack of attention'' was ''perhaps more shocking'' than what Mr. Foley had done.
 Drew Lankford, a spokesman for Mr. Kellam, said the attacks on Ms. Drake had ''painted her into a corner'' because she was unwilling to denounce Mr. Hastert. Ms. Drake has said she will wait for a thorough investigation into what Mr. Hastert knew. (The matter has come up less in the Senate race between Mr. Allen and Jim Webb, the Democrat.)
 Brian Courtney, a Republican-leaning sales manager attending the concert, said the Foley affair had led to ''the kind of mudslinging one would expect to see at an election time like this.'' He added that he was paying closer attention to the ''values and character'' of the candidates, and that he would probably vote Republican again.
 Republicans have put up a vigorous defense, mainly through conservative allies and on talk radio. An e-mail message to talk-radio hosts from the Republican Party last week asked, ''How would Democrats react if one of their own had a sexual relationship with an intern, was found out, then lied to a grand jury in an attempt to cover it up?'' 
 Rush Limbaugh devoted much of his airtime to the Democrats' defense of President Bill Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Sean Hannity focused on former Representative Gerry Studds, a Massachusetts Democrat who in 1983 admitted having sex with a teenage male page, won re-election and served several more terms with the support of his colleagues.
 Still, many conservative churchgoers said that what stood out for them was not the politics but the individual sin. ''It is not going to affect my vote because I don't live in Florida,'' said Scott O'Connell, a mechanical engineer who described himself as a fundamentalist. ''But there is a bigger moral issue which I would say is the prism I view this through: I do not believe in homosexuality.''
 David Thomas, a father taking his family to the concert, said that he, too, was leaning toward voting Republican and that the scandal only reinforced his conservative Christian convictions. ''That is the problem we have in society,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''Nobody polices anybody. Everybody has a 'right' to do whatever.''
 In an interview on Friday, Pastor Anne Gimenez of the 15,000-member Rock Church here said the scandal ''doesn't change the issues we are voting on,'' like abortion, public expression of religion and same-sex marriage. 
 The church has been actively registering parishioners and reminding them to vote. ''Every Sunday already,'' Ms. Gimenez said.

HEADLINE: Genealogy for the Living, the Dead, the Far Away

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
GENEALOGY sites have long helped their customers reconnect with long-dead ancestors. Now, in keeping with the social networking trend, some of these sites are trying to connect living relatives, as well. 
 Ancestry.com, a division of MyFamily.com in Provo, Utah, has spurred interaction between close and distant relatives by letting them more freely share information about their forebears and post old photos, and it is also considering a family subscription service.
The recent changes are aimed at transforming the site from a niche service for genealogy buffs to one for mainstream users. And the changes have yielded results that would be the envy of nearly any other social networking site. Since the changes were put into effect early last month, users have been adding photos, often from long-dead relatives, at a rate of 3,000 a day, according to Tim Sullivan, MyFamily's chief executive. 
 ''We've seen an explosion in the amount of content we're acquiring from the community," Mr. Sullivan said. ''And this stuff hasn't been that highly promoted yet.'' 
 It is not simply the success of social networking sites like MySpace that is making genealogy sites reconsider their emphasis on dead relatives over live ones. These sites also face new competition from organizations and businesses offering free and innovative online genealogy options, including start-ups that rely on DNA profiles to match remote relatives. 
 One of the most intriguing innovations involves such DNA matching. The nonprofit Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation last month introduced a free service (www.smgf.org) that lets users find distant relatives by tracing their genetic connections.
 Ancestry.com, which charges a fee, also faces new competition from services like Amiglia.com that offer free spaces and tools for families to post videos, share calendars and even build comparatively rudimentary family trees. 
 ''If you define social networks as people you want to hang out with,'' said Charlene Li, a media analyst with the consulting firm Forrester Research, ''you can't get much better than families.''
 ''But it's always really tough when you're asking for significant payments, especially when others are doing similar things for free,'' she said.
 Ancestry.com has no intention of competing directly with free sites, according to Mr. Sullivan, especially because it is redesigning its own free family networking site, MyFamily.com, for introduction in coming months.
 The site already does well, at least for a niche service. The company, which is privately held, generated $140 million in subscription revenue last year, Mr. Sullivan said, up from $47 million in 2002. Sales are growing this year as well, he added, with ''very, very solid'' profit margins despite heavy and continuing spending on digitizing historical records from an array of public databases. 
 Annual subscribers, who pay $155, are renewing at a rate of about 60 percent; monthly subscribers, who pay $30, are renewing at an 80 percent rate. And those figures are on the upswing in recent months, Mr. Sullivan said.
 The Ancestry users are taking advantage of one new service, in which subscribers can invite others to view their family trees free of charge. The site's 725,000 subscribers have invited roughly 42,000 nonsubscribers to look at such material, which includes images of hand-written documents going back as far as the 1790 Census.
 That sharing has been accelerated by the refinement of yet another new feature, the OneWorldTree, which automatically connects a user's family tree to others worldwide if it finds common relatives with another subscriber. Ancestry.com helps those who maintain the family trees connect with each other if they wish. 
 ''There's a lot more social networking going on now,'' Mr. Sullivan said.
 Despite the promising performance of the new services, it is unlikely that Ancestry.com can break into the mainstream, Ms. Li of Forrester Research said. 
 ''Online dating is the perfect analogy for this,'' she said. Fewer than 10 percent of all Internet users in the United States use online dating sites, she said, ''and it's not as if these sites don't work. It's not because they're not easy to use. It's just that not that many people want to do it.''
 Changes in the genealogy industry -- especially the introduction of the DNA services -- could entice more casual users. Scott Woodward, executive director of the Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation, said DNA searches allowed users to find many more family connections than they would otherwise do through documents alone. 
 ''The goal is to be able to take any two people in the world and show them exactly how they're related, where their common ancestors are, where they lived and when,'' he said.
 At the moment, the database is of limited value to the average user because it relies on users to volunteer a DNA sample, and so far just 65,000 people worldwide have done so. But beyond the genealogical information on those 65,000, the DNA database may yield useful information. Those who spend the roughly $100 it costs to obtain their own DNA signature can use that information to search for connections among other DNA donors.
 About 80 percent of those who take that additional step, Mr. Woodward said, find someone else with a common ancestor who lived in the last 500 years and a chart detailing that connection. 
 Ancestry.com is accustomed to competing with public institutions that give away genealogy information for which it charges. EllisIsland.org gives away data about immigrant ship manifests to help raise awareness about Ellis Island, while FamilySearch.org, which is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, gives away census data at least partly to help its members who would like to baptize ancestors into the church.
 Mr. Sullivan of Ancestry.com said the company would offer DNA searching in the near future, and would compete with the Sorenson database as it does with the other free sites -- by surrounding its own version of the service with a broader range of features. 
 ''The real value is in the networking you can do with people that have similar profiles,'' he said. ''It's an opportunity to take this network effect to an entirely new level.''

HEADLINE: Virgin Hopes 'Disembarkaphobia' Is Contagious

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Virgin Atlantic is taking a new tack to promote its economy class service in the United States, publicizing the amenities the service features by associating them with a new disease dubbed ''disembarkaphobia.'' 
 Defined as ''the desire to stay onboard a Virgin Atlantic flight,'' the imaginary malady is the centerpiece of a new, tongue-in-cheek online campaign by Crispin Porter & Bogusky, which is 49% owned by MDC Partners, a Toronto-based marketing communications company.
 Virgin Atlantic has been phasing the campaign in since June, initially running banner ads on travel Web sites and on its own Web site's home page, and, more recently, introducing a cartoon on its site that provides an in-depth description of both the symptoms of the disease and the in-flight pampering the airlinet provides. Some ads also mention Virgin Atlantic's economy class rates. 
 The banner ads ran through early August and were then temporarily suspended, after United Kingdom authorities foiled a terrorist plot against airlines. They began running again on September 12, while the cartoon started running last Friday.
 According to Chris Rossi, vice president of sales and marketing, North America, for Virgin Atlantic, the new campaign is the first the carrier has ever done in this country for economy class that has not focused strictly on airfares.
 ''I think this is a huge opportunity for differentiation, because economy class service has become commoditized, particularly in the United States,'' Mr. Rossi said. ''You simply see price ads for economy class. But we're trying to feature the benefits in tandem with the price; we want people to fly us because of the product features.''
 Stimulating economy class traffic is important to Virgin Atlantic: According to Mr. Rossi, these passengers generate 35% of the airline's revenue.
 ''We'd like to move that up to 40% of the total,'' Mr. Rossi said, noting that the carrier wants to attract new passengers like young adults out of college: Although they might be flying in economy class today, it hopes they will eventually graduate to the airline's premium economy or upper class services when they can afford them.
 The carrier has deliberately opted to keep the campaign totally online, Mr. Rossi said, because doing so creates ''a better chance to increase our ROI on this,'' he said.
 To that end, Virgin Atlantic has been running banner ads explaining disembarkaphobia on travel Web sites like oag.com, sidestep.com, travelzoo.com, hotwire.com and lonelyplanet.com.
 These ads ask questions like, ''Can I get disembarkaphobia from ice cream?'' The response to this is, ''If you're in the air and it's complimentary, the answer is yes.''
 Another banner ad asks, ''If I watch a movie while drinking a complimentary beverage, will I get double disembarkaphobia?'' The answer to this question is ''Yes. And yes.''
 Besides featuring such questions, the banner ads list the price of a roundtrip economy class ticket from Virgin Atlantic's U.S. gateways that are closest to the person viewing the ad, as well as amenities offered in economy class, i.e., a personal entertainment system, ice cream during movies and complimentary beverages. The tagline on these ads and throughout the campaign is ''It's better inside the plane.''
 Virgin is running another banner ad on the home page of its own Web site, a cartoon of a man on a Virgin Atlantic flight, who is depicted eating, drinking, using the in-flight entertainment system, and sleeping while a flight attendant tucks a blanket around him. This ad suggests visitors to the site ''experience first hand the pampering that causes disembarkaphobia,'' and directs them to an animated cartoon on the section of the carrier's Web site that contains its lowest available fares.
 Starring the same passenger shown in the banner ad on the home page, the animated cartoon contains lengthy explanations of disembarkaphobia and of Virgin's economy class service. For example, it poses questions like, Why is dismembarkaphobia ''so difficult to pronounce?'' The answer is, it is a ''word with many letters, which means it's far easier to catch than it is to say.''
 Economy class amenities described here include a 40-channel in-flight entertainment system, ''this leading contributor of disembarkaphobia found in every seatback''; video games; kits containing socks and grooming items like toothbrushes and toothpaste; and a three-meal food service.
 The cartoon is accompanied by sounds passengers can hear in an aircraft cabin, like engine noise at takeoff, announcements from the captain, and the ringing of the cabin crew call bell.
 Bill Wright, the creative director of CPB, called the disembarkaphobia concept ''a parody of medical advertising you see out there today,'' and said the campaign is targeted at the ''general population that's predisposed to travel.''
 Mr. Rossi said Virgin Atlantic found travel Web sites particularly attractive for this campaign because ''we try to be where our customers are at the time they make their decision to travel they do so much research online, we want to be there when they put their thoughts together about their travel.''
 Mr. Rossi said expenditures for the new campaign represent 60% of Virgin Atlantic's online advertising budget.

HEADLINE: Short Odds for Ignorance

BYLINE: By Robert Hahn and Paul Tetlock. 
Robert Hahn, the executive director of the American Enterprise Institute-Brookings Joint Center, and Paul Tetlock, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Texas, are the editors of ''Information Markets: A New Way of Making Decisions.''

 BODY:
LATE last month, as Congress rushed to adjourn, lawmakers passed legislation that would make it a crime for credit card companies and banks to send payments to Internet gambling sites. 
 The measure was attached to an unrelated bill on port security at the 11th hour. If the president signs the legislation, as expected, it will have major implications for the millions of Americans who gamble online. It will also likely lead to a temporary halt in domestic online betting, which will result in billion-dollar losses for Internet gambling sites.
While these would be significant outcomes, they are probably not that important for the overall economy. Consumers will find other ways to spend their money, either in casinos or elsewhere. 
 The bigger economic story is how this act, by effectively prohibiting Internet betting, could unintentionally slow the emergence of new tools that have the potential to improve the productivity of the private sector and the government. Sadly, this is an aspect of the measure that both its supporters and its opponents seem to have overlooked. 
 Representative Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican who was a co-sponsor of the bill, suggests that it will help reduce gambling addiction and money laundering. Not surprisingly, executives at online gambling companies argue that the bill unduly restricts consumer freedom. 
 What neither side has mentioned, however, is how the prohibition on Internet gambling could wind up putting the kibosh on several forms of Internet wagering that provide useful information. 
 For instance, we now have markets for predicting political and economic events, where you can wager on the monthly unemployment rate or the outcome of the presidential race. (If you visit TradeSports.com, you can bet on Hillary Clinton's chances of becoming the next president: a contract purchased for $1.91 would yield $10 if she wins -- implying that the senator has about a 1 in 5 chance of winning.)
 Why should we care? Because information markets, which essentially reflect the collective wisdom of savvy bettors, can help us make more accurate forecasts. Information markets have outperformed experts in a number of areas, whether it's predicting point spreads in football games or elections or printer sales. There are more than 20 Web sites that offer information-market securities, including those run by Goldman Sachs and the University of Iowa.
 These markets work for several reasons: first, almost anyone can participate; second, people think hard when they have to back up their predictions with money -- buy the right presidential contract and you win, buy the wrong one and you lose; third, the profit motive encourages people to look for better information. 
 Many academics across the political spectrum believe that information markets could be critical in improving decision making by governments, nonprofit organizations and the private sector. Yet, because of current regulatory restrictions, the Iowa market is the only place in the United States dedicated to improving our understanding of these markets. Also, those information markets whose purpose is to make money have generally based themselves offshore, partly in reaction to existing state and federal restrictions on Internet gambling.
 So what can be done? Congress needs to draw a distinction between run-of-the-mill Internet gambling and information markets that can serve a broader economic purpose. To this end, it should empower the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to regulate information markets. The commission is already charged with regulating futures contracts, and information-market contracts can be thought of as futures contracts because they represent bets on what will happen down the road.
 Congress should also impose a requirement that information-market contracts pass an economic purpose test. The futures commission should permit information market contracts that are likely to provide significant financial hedging opportunities or valuable information for improving economic decisions. Internet poker games and lotteries would not pass the test; contracts involving Gross Domestic Product, housing starts or expected annual rainfall would. So, too would predictions on who will be president: that would affect the economy.
 For such regulation to work, it needs to be light-handed. To maximize innovation, Congress should allow for federal pre-emption of state and other federal regulatory authorities for information-market contracts that pass an economic purpose test. Such pre-emption would reduce uncertainty for innovators concerned about violating state gambling laws. 
 The regulation should also allow for broad exemptions where sensible. One could, for example, introduce exemptions for research where the size of individual investments does not exceed $1,000 per participant. The futures commission already has the power to encourage such research, but thus far it has only given its blessing to the Iowa markets. 
 We think that Congress has correctly pinpointed Internet gambling as an area deserving of further study, and possibly legislation. But a blanket prohibition on such gambling is premature, and likely to be counterproductive. If this prohibition becomes law, Congress should make sure that productive information markets are allowed to flourish.

HEADLINE: China and Japan Take Steps to Mend Fences

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Monday, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
China and Japan said they had made progress addressing their historical animosities and territorial tensions on Sunday, as Shinzo Abe, the new Japanese prime minister, devoted his first overseas trip to mending ties with Asian neighbors.
 The Chinese president, Hu Jintao, called Mr. Abe's visit, the first to Beijing by a Japanese leader in five years, ''a turning point'' for two Asian powers, whose relations had sharply declined. Mr. Abe told reporters on Sunday night that he also considered the event a turning point ''that will lead Japan-China relations to a higher level.''
The trip coincided with fears that North Korea would test a nuclear weapon at any moment, which may have helped focus the meeting on a common strategic concern rather than on political disputes. 
 North Korea said Monday that it conducted the test. At the time of the meeting, both sides said they would do their utmost to dissuade the North from conducting a nuclear test and would urge it to return to multilateral negotiations. But there appeared to be no agreement on a response if North Korea carried out its threat to conduct a test. ''We saw eye to eye that a nuclear test can never be tolerated because it would pose a grave threat to peace in Asia and the international community,'' Mr. Abe said.
 The fact that China agreed to a visit from Mr. Abe amid the uncertainty over the test and the opening on Sunday of China's annual Communist Party Central Committee meeting, a major political event for Chinese leaders, underscored how eager Chinese leaders were to reduce tensions.
 Mr. Abe, who took office on Sept. 26, broke a tradition among Japanese prime ministers of visiting Washington on their first overseas trip, emphasizing his desire to improve the diplomatic environment among Japan's neighbors. His next stop is Seoul, South Korea.
 While economic ties between China and Japan have remained robust, political relations froze after Junichiro Koizumi, Mr. Abe's predecessor, made visits to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. China views it as a provocative symbol of Japan's World War II-era militarism, which took millions of Chinese lives.
 The countries have also sparred over control of potentially oil-rich exploration sites in the East China Sea and over Japan's ambition to join the United Nations Security Council, as well as Japan's increasingly close alliance with the United States.In early 2005, residents in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities protested Japan's treatment of its history with China, in rare and at times violent urban demonstrations. Chinese security forces initially did little to suppress the protests, but later banned street demonstrations and have taken steps to contain popular outrage.
 China's main television news on Sunday devoted an unusual 12 minutes to Mr. Abe's meetings with Mr. Hu, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and Wu Bangguo, chief of China's Parliament. The official news program rarely devotes that much time to a foreign leader unless Chinese leaders wish to signal their support.
 ''Your ongoing visit is serving as a turning point in China-Japan relations, and I hope it will also serve as a new starting point for the improvement and development of bilateral ties,'' Mr. Hu told Mr. Abe, the state news media reported.
 The only concrete result of the visit was a commitment to step up dialogue on all matters that divide the countries. Mr. Abe said that he had invited Mr. Hu and Mr. Wen to Japan, and that they planned to visit soon.
 The two sides agreed to set up a joint panel of experts to study their common history and to discuss making needed changes in the operations of the United Nations.
 Mr. Abe said the two countries would also discuss exploration in the East China Sea, and broader energy and environmental issues.
 Mr. Abe is regarded by Chinese analysts as a nationalist who favors Japan assuming a more prominent international role commensurate with its status as the world's second-largest economy. Some Chinese have expressed fears that he may be determined to continue Mr. Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni Shrine.
 While Japanese officials say the shrine commemorates those who fell fighting for their country and stands for peace, China and South Korea have opposed the visits because the shrine and an associated museum also honor 14 Class A war criminals.
 Mr. Abe departed slightly from Mr. Koizumi's position. He has declined to say whether he will visit the shrine, opting for ambiguity.
 It is unclear if Japanese and Chinese diplomats reached an understanding before Mr. Abe's visit. Chinese state media indicated then that there was a new understanding. Japan denied that it had offered any concessions.
 But Mr. Abe said Sunday that China appeared to have accepted how he said had he would handle the matter.

HEADLINE: In the Race for Governor of Michigan, the Struggling Economy Is Topic A

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: THREE RIVERS, Mich., Oct. 4 

 BODY:
If for much of the country the economic signs seem relatively healthy, they do not in places like this town. A plastics plant nearby closed days before Christmas, a company that makes mirror parts for cars has shrunk and the mayor says he heard talk, just this month, of possible cuts at a factory that makes drive shafts. 
 And so, while elections in other regions have turned to matters like national security, the war in Iraq and Congressional scandal, Michigan's races for governor and, to a lesser degree, the United States Senate are hinging this year almost entirely on the struggling economy and the question of who is to blame for it.
In the state's cloud of sinking numbers, Republicans hope for an opportunity to pick up two positions. In other states with once-robust industrial bases, including Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania, economic worries are playing a similar, if far more subtle and layered, role this fall. 
 ''We've thought about moving south,'' said Deb Hallock, 44, who said she had lived in Three Rivers for 20 years but lost her home about a year ago when she and her husband could no longer pay the mortgage. Ms. Hallock makes pizzas at a fast-food restaurant; her husband makes cargo trailers at a factory but had no job when they were evicted. ''I don't really know what a governor can do to stop all of what's happening here, but I wish someone would do something.''
 Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, an enormously popular Democrat when she took office four years ago, now faces a serious challenge from Dick DeVos, the former president of the Amway Corporation and the son of a co-founder. 
 While campaigning, Mr. DeVos regularly ticks off dire statistics: with major cuts at the Detroit-area automobile companies, Michigan's unemployment rate of 7.1 percent is one of the worst in the nation; the state has lost 85,000 jobs in the last four years; and it has ranked second in the number of young people moving elsewhere.
 In a testy first debate between the candidates in early October, the answers to questions on almost every topic seemed to circle back to this single issue. Mr. DeVos, who says his own business acumen is just the medicine Michigan needs, said Ms. Granholm was responsible for failing to create ''the atmosphere'' for job creation in Michigan despite the economic recovery plan she talked about at nearly every campaign stop. 
 ''I find it amazing,'' Mr. DeVos said in the debate, ''to hear the governor say the plan is working when the people of Michigan aren't.''
 Ms. Granholm, who said hers was the most aggressive economic recovery plan in the nation, seemed to sidestep responsibility for what has happened here, saying she had ''stepped into this current'' in a state that had long depended on cars for its livelihood.
 ''The question is, Why did we get here, and how are we going to get out?'' Ms. Granholm said. 
 Elsewhere, the economic questions are less extreme, less consuming and, in some cases, far more ambiguous. For the most part, challengers in nearby states have bemoaned economic failures, while incumbents have pointed to opposing, upbeat economic signs or stayed mainly silent on the matter.
 In Ohio, the loss of manufacturing work, along with political corruption and scandal, has contributed to ''a generally sour atmosphere'' among voters, said Herbert Asher, a political science professor emeritus at Ohio State University. 
 Sherrod Brown, the Democratic challenger to Senator Mike DeWine, has worked to remind voters of their economic portrait, ''a thriving manufacturing base dismantled piece by piece,'' in the words of Mr. Brown's spokeswoman, Joanna Kuebler.
 Indiana's economy has improved. But Russell L. Hanson, a political scientist at Indiana University, said the recovery had been slow and spotty in parts of the state, especially where the auto industry's troubles had affected Indiana's component suppliers -- something the challengers in several competitive House races have made an issue.
 A complicated picture has also emerged in Pennsylvania, with candidates, even those from the same political party, pointing to opposing signs as evidence of the relative healthiness, or the horror, of the state's economy. Gov. Edward G. Rendell, a Democrat, has boasted of new job creation. But Bob Casey, another Democrat and an ally of Mr. Rendell, who is running against Senator Rick Santorum, a Republican, has complained of an environment in which tuition and health care costs are rising while incomes cannot keep up.
 In Michigan, meanwhile, no candidate is boasting.
 Mr. DeVos and Ms. Granholm pepper their speeches, commercials and Web sites with proposals for reversing the economic tide. Mr. DeVos has pressed for change, proposing that the state speed the granting of permits for businesses and that the tax on businesses known as the Single Business Tax be ended. 
 His campaign has scoffed at Ms. Granholm's efforts, like a Cool Cities program to give grants to cities for economic development, as too paltry. He has also suggested she did not try hard enough to persuade the Japanese to open a Honda factory in Michigan. 
 ''A cool city is one where you get a job,'' said John Truscott, Mr. DeVos's director of communications. ''We never thought we would surpass Mississippi in a race for the bottom, but we're there.''
 Mr. DeVos, a relative political newcomer from Ada who aides say has poured about $17 million of his own money into the race, began advertising in February, which helps explain how every voter interviewed in towns in the Kalamazoo area, like Three Rivers, and near Lansing said they knew his name. 
 For a time, polls showed Mr. DeVos even or slightly ahead of Ms. Granholm, but more recent surveys suggest she has pulled ahead slightly. In a survey of 600 likely voters taken this month for The Detroit News and several television stations, Ms. Granholm was leading, with 46 percent saying they would vote for her, compared with 40 percent for Mr. DeVos; the margin of error was four percentage points. But of those polled, 12 percent said they were undecided.
 Ms. Granholm, a former federal prosecutor and a former state attorney general, said she was pressing to diversify the state's economy into fields like alternative energy, life sciences and domestic security; wanted to double the number of college graduates in Michigan within a decade; and hoped to change the way the state handles work force training for those without jobs.
 And while Mr. DeVos has tried to blame Ms. Granholm for the state's struggles, in an interview, she directed the blame elsewhere: to circumstances beyond her control (''No other state is the automotive capital of the world''); to the Bush administration (''He has sat idly by while the industry reels''); and even to Mr. DeVos, who supported the trade agreements, Nafta and Cafta, that she said had helped leave the Michigan economy in a wreck.
 ''If we had diversified our state 10 years ago, we wouldn't be here,'' Ms. Granholm said. ''I'm going to go anywhere and do anything to change the economy of Michigan.''
 Similarly, in the Senate race here, Debbie Stabenow, the Democratic incumbent, and Mike Bouchard, a sheriff and her Republican challenger, have each touted economic recovery plans: ''Jobs Agenda'' for her and ''Renewing Michigan's Economy'' for him.
 But at a Laundromat in Three Rivers, all the plans in the world could not convince Steve Brunn that Michigan could be turned around. Like others here, Mr. Brunn, 54, said he was doubtful that any campaign promise would add up to jobs after all the commercials were over and the votes were in.
 ''We're being batted back and forth between the Republicans and Democrats,'' he said. ''DeVos is talking like everybody else -- he wants to make change -- but what is he really going to do to change this? We're competing with these other countries, and there are no answers.''
 Thomas Lowry, who for 11 years has been mayor of Three Rivers, said this town of 7,400 still had its share of manufacturing companies, though the numbers, he said, seemed to shrink little by little each year. The echoes reach far beyond the factories, Mr. Lowry said. The diner downtown loses business. More and more ''for sale'' signs fill front yards along quiet streets. 
 Even his own business, a bookstore in the center of downtown, has seen the sale of magazines, a minor luxury item for many, fall off. ''It ripples everywhere,'' he said.
 Mr. Lowry, who said he expected to vote for Ms. Granholm, said he was not sure to what extent the voters would hold their political leaders responsible for all that had happened -- and all that had not. ''There's something about our species, though, that wants a scapegoat,'' he said.

HEADLINE: E. Coli Worry Spreads to Lettuce; California Grower Issues Recall

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
Less than a week after the Food and Drug Administration lifted its warning on fresh spinach grown in the Salinas Valley in California, a popular brand of lettuce grown there was recalled on Sunday over concerns about E. coli contamination. 
 The lettuce does not appear to have caused any illnesses, said the president of the grower, the Nunes Company.
The recall comes amid warnings that some brands of spinach, bottled carrot juice and recent shipments of beef could cause health risks.
 Executives ordered the recall after learning that irrigation water may have been contaminated with E. coli, said Tom Nunes Jr., president of the company. The company has not found E. coli bacteria in the lettuce itself, Mr. Nunes said.
 ''We're just reacting to a water test only,'' he said. ''We know there's generic E. coli on it, but we're not sure what that means.'' 
 The recall covers green leaf lettuce sold from Oct. 3 to Oct. 6 under the Foxy brand in grocery stores in Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. It was also sold to distributors in those states who may have sold it to restaurants or institutions.
 The lettuce was packaged as ''Green Leaf 24 Count, waxed carton,'' and ''Green Leaf 18 Count, cellophane sleeve, returnable carton.'' Packaging is stamped with the lot code 6SL0024.
 Julie Zawisza, an F.D.A. spokeswoman, said the agency was aware of the voluntary recall but had no details. Mr. Nunes said the bacteria in the lettuce fields probably did not share the source of the E. coli found in spinach that has sickened nearly 200 people and has been linked to three deaths nationwide.
 The recall at Nunes, a family-owned business with more than 20,000 acres of cropland in Arizona and California, comes days after federal agents searched two Salinas Valley produce companies connected to the nationwide spinach scare.
 Epidemiologists also warned consumers last week to stay away from some bottled carrot juice after a Florida woman was paralyzed and three people in Georgia experienced respiratory failure, apparently from botulism poisoning.
 On Friday, an Iowa company announced that it was recalling 5,200 pounds of ground beef suspected of having E. coli. The government said no illnesses had been reported from consumption of the beef.
 The outbreaks have sparked demands to create a new federal agency in charge of food safety. Senators Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, both New York Democrats, are sponsoring legislation written by Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, to create a unified Food Safety Agency.
 The outbreaks have devastated the economy of the Salinas Valley, where farmers in the area began plowing spinach crops under and laying off workers last month.

HEADLINE: North Korea Says It Tested a Nuclear Device Underground

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; William J. Broad contributed reporting from New York, and Thom Shanker from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Monday, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
North Korea said Sunday night that it had set off its first nuclear test, becoming the eighth country in history, and arguably the most unstable and most dangerous, to proclaim that it has joined the club of nuclear weapons states.
 The test came just two days after the country was warned by the United Nations Security Council that the action could lead to severe consequences.
 American officials cautioned that they had not yet received any confirmation that the test had occurred. The United States Geological Survey said it had detected a tremor of 4.2 magnitude on the Korean Peninsula. 
 China called the test a ''flagrant and brazen'' violation of international opinion and said it ''firmly opposes'' North Korea's conduct. 
 Senior Bush administration officials said that they had little reason to doubt the announcement, and warned that the test would usher in a new era of confrontation with the isolated and unpredictable country run by President Kim Jong-il. 
 Early Monday morning, even before the test was confirmed, Bush administration officials were holding conference calls to discuss ways to further cut off a country that is already subject to sanctions, and hard-liners said the moment had arrived for neighboring countries, especially China and Russia, to cut off the trade and oil supplies that have been Mr. Kim's lifeline.
 In South Korea, the country that fought a bloody war with the North for three years and has lived with an uneasy truce and failed efforts at reconciliation for more than half a century, officials said they believed that an explosion occurred around 10:36 p.m. New York time -- 11:36 a.m. Monday in Korea. 
 They identified the source of the explosion as North Hamgyong Province, roughly the area where American spy satellites have been focused for several years on a variety of suspected underground test sites. 
 That was less than an hour after North Korean officials had called their counterparts in China and warned them that a test was just minutes away. The Chinese, who have been North Korea's main ally for 60 years but have grown increasingly frustrated by the its defiance of Beijing, sent an emergency alert to Washington through the United States Embassy in Beijing. Within minutes, President Bush was notified, shortly after 10 p.m., by his national security adviser, Stephen Hadley, that a test was imminent.
 North Korea's decision to conduct the test demonstrated what the world has suspected for years: the country has joined India, Pakistan and Israel as one of the world's ''undeclared'' nuclear powers. India and Pakistan conducted tests in 1998; Israel has never acknowledged conducting a test or possessing a weapon. But by actually setting off a weapon, if that is proven, the North has chosen to end years of carefully crafted and diplomatically useful ambiguity about its abilities.
 The North's decision to set off a nuclear device could profoundly change the politics of Asia.
 The test occurred only a week after Japan installed a new, more nationalistic prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and just as the country was renewing a debate about whether its ban on possessing nuclear weapons -- deeply felt in a country that saw two of its cities incinerated in 1945 -- still makes strategic sense. 
 And it shook the peninsula just as Mr. Abe was arriving in South Korea for the first time as prime minister, in an effort to repair a badly strained relationship, having just visited with Chinese leaders in Beijing. It places his untested administration in the midst of one of the region's biggest security crises in years, and one whose outcome will be watched closely in Iran and other states suspected of attempting to follow the path that North Korea has taken.
 Now, Tokyo and Washington are expected to put even more pressure on the South Korean government to terminate its ''sunshine policy'' of trade, tourism and openings to the North -- a policy that has been the source of enormous tension between Seoul and Washington since Mr. Bush took office. 
 The explosion was the product of nearly four decades of work by North Korea, one of the world's poorest and most isolated countries. The nation of 23 million people appears constantly fearful that its far richer, more powerful neighbors -- and particularly the United States -- will try to unseat its leadership. The country's founder, Kim Il-sung, who died in 1994, emerged from the Korean War determined to equal the power of the United States, and acutely aware that Gen. Douglas MacArthur had requested nuclear weapons to use against his country. 
 But it took decades to put together the technology, and only in the past few years has the North appeared to have made a political decision to speed forward. ''I think they just had their military plan to demonstrate that no one could mess with them, and they weren't going to be deterred, not even by the Chinese,'' a senior American official who deals with the North said late Sunday evening. ''In the end, there was just no stopping them.'' 
 But the explosion was also the product of more than two decades of diplomatic failure, spread over at least three presidencies. American spy satellites saw the North building a good-size nuclear reactor in the early 1980's, and by the early 1990's the C.I.A. estimated that the country could have one or two nuclear weapons. But a series of diplomatic efforts to ''freeze'' the nuclear program -- including a 1994 accord signed with the Clinton administration -- ultimately broke down, amid distrust and recriminations on both sides. 
 Three years ago, just as President Bush was sending American troops toward Iraq, the North threw out the few remaining weapons inspectors living at their nuclear complex in Yongbyon, and moved 8,000 nuclear fuel rods they had kept under lock and key. Those rods contained enough plutonium, experts said, to produce five or six nuclear weapons, though it is unclear how many the North now stockpiles.
 For years, some diplomats assumed that the North was using that ambiguity to trade away its nuclear capability, for recognition, security guarantees, aid and trade with the West. But in the end, the country's reclusive leader, Kim Jong-il, who inherited the mantle of leadership from his father, still called the ''Great Leader,'' appears to have concluded that the surest way of getting what he seeks is to demonstrate that he has the capability to strike back if attacked.
 Assessing the nature of that ability is difficult. If the test occurred as the North claimed, it is unclear whether it was an actual bomb or a more primitive device. Some experts cautioned that it could try to fake an explosion, setting off conventional explosives; the only way to know for sure will be if American ''sniffer'' planes, patrolling the North Korean coast, pick up evidence of nuclear byproducts in the air.
 Even then, it is not clear that the North could fabricate that bomb into a weapon that could fit atop its missiles, one of the country's few significant exports.
 But the big fear about North Korea, American officials have long said, has less to do with its ability to lash out than it does with its proclivity to proliferate. The country has sold its missiles and other weapons to Iran, Syria and Pakistan; at various moments in the six-party talks that have gone on for the past few years, North Korean representatives have threatened to sell nuclear weapons. But in a statement issued last week, announcing that it intends to set off a test, the country said it would not sell its nuclear products.
 The fear of proliferation prompted President Bush to declare in 2003 that the United States would never ''tolerate'' a nuclear-armed North Korea. He has never defined what he means by ''tolerate,'' and on Sunday night Tony Snow, Mr. Bush's press secretary, said that, assuming the report of the test is accurate, the United States would now go to the United Nations to determine ''what our next steps should be in response to this very serious step.''
 Nuclear testing is often considered a necessary step to proving a weapon's reliability as well as the most forceful way for a nation to declare its status as a nuclear power. 
 ''Once they do that, it's serious," said Harold M. Agnew, a former director of the Los Alamos weapons laboratory, which designed most of the nation's nuclear arms. "Otherwise, the North Koreans are just jerking us around.''
 Networks of seismometers that detect faint trembles in the earth and track distant rumbles are the best way to spot an underground nuclear test. 
 The big challenge is to distinguish the signatures of earthquakes from those of nuclear blasts. Typically, the shock waves from nuclear explosions begin with a sharp spike as earth and rock are compressed violently. The signal then tends to become fuzzier as surface rumblings and shudders and after shocks create seismologic mayhem. 
 With earthquakes, it is usually the opposite. A gentle jostling suddenly becomes much bigger and more violent. 
 Most of the world's seismic networks that look for nuclear blasts are designed to detect explosions as small as one kiloton, or equal to 1,000 tons of high explosives. On instruments for detecting earthquakes, such a blast would measure a magnitude of about 4, like a small tremor. 
 Philip E. Coyle III, a former head of weapons testing at the Pentagon and former director of nuclear testing for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a weapons-design center in California, said the North Koreans could learn much from a nuclear test even if it was small by world standards or less than an unqualified success. 
 ''It would not be totally surprising if it was a fizzle and they said it was a success because they learned something,'' he said. ''We did that sometimes. We had a missile defense test not so long ago that failed, but the Pentagon said it was a success because they learned something, which I agree with. Failures can teach you a lot.''

North Korea Announces Test of Nuclear Weapon
North Korea said that it had set off its first nuclear test -- just two days after the country was warned by the United Nations Security Council that the action could lead to severe consequences. American officials cautioned that they had not yet received any confirmation that the test had occurred. A1

The North Korea nuclear test amounted to a major failure for China, which mounted one of its most extensive diplomatic efforts in years to find a negotiated solution to the North Korean nuclear crisis. 
The Chinese expressed their anger in unusually strong terms, saying the test was ''flagrant and brazen.'' A6

Tsunami Project Stalled
Construction of a road in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, meant as a good-will gesture from the American people to the survivors of the 2004 tsunami, has met with difficulty. Because of long negotiations to acquire right of way through residential and farm land, and through several hundred graves of religious significance, the project has not even started. A8

Hints at Need for Iraq Change
James A. Baker III, the Republican co-chairman of a panel reassessing Iraq strategy for President Bush, said he expected that the panel would depart from Mr. Bush's repeated calls to ''stay the course,'' and he strongly suggested that the White House enter direct talks with countries it has so far kept at arms length, including Iran and Syria. A1

American and Iraqi troops fought a fierce battle with militants in the city of Diwaniya, a stronghold of militia members loyal to radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, the American military said. The skirmish was the third serious clash between American or Iraqi soldiers against members of the Mahdi Army in Diwaniya in less than two months. A8

Japan and China Mend Fences
China and Japan said they had made progress addressing their historical animosities and territorial differences as Shinzo Abe, the new Japanese prime minister, made his first trip to mend ties with Asian neighbors. President Hu Jintao of China, left, called Mr. Abe's visit a turning point for two Asian powers whose relations had sharply declined. A3

Iran Opposition Cleric Seized
Ayatollah Mohammad Kazemeni Boroujerdi, a senior cleric who opposes clerical rule of Iran, was arrested after clashes with Iranian police officers, news agencies reported. The reports quoted officials as saying that some of the cleric's supporters were armed with knives and daggers and that the police used tear gas to disperse them. A3

Transponder Not Recalled
The electronic device for broadcasting a plane's identity and altitude carried by the business jet that apparently collided with a Boeing 737 over the Amazon was not one of the potentially faulty ones ordered repaired by American safety officials, the manufacturer said. A9

NATIONAL A10-15

Religious Employers Enjoy Legal Shield From Lawsuits
Legislators, judges and regulators have carved out or preserved safe havens that shield religious employers of all faiths from most employee lawsuits, from laws protecting pensions and providing unemployment benefits, and from laws that give employees the right to form unions to negotiate with their employers. A1

Virginia Republicans Resolute
In dozens of interviews in southeastern Virginia, a swing state in tight races for the House and Senate, many conservative Christians said that rather than discourage them from going to the polls, the scandal surrounding Representative Mark Foley only reinforced their reasons to vote for their Republican incumbents. A1

For all the contradictions and inconsistencies in the tale of Mark Foley, the investigation into how Republicans handled concerns about his conduct may hinge on what transpired in a private meeting that was convened in his office last year. A12

Races Hinge on Local Economy
Michigan's political races for governor and the Senate are hinging nearly entirely on the struggling economy and the question of who is to blame for it. And in other Rust Belt states, including Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania, economic worries are playing a similar role, if a far more subtle one. A10

Lawyer's Book Causes Trouble
Joyce Dudley, a deputy district attorney in Santa Barbara, published a crime novel. The novel concerns a rape case with echoes of a real one. An appeals court in Ventura, Calif., ruled that Ms. Dudley's novel had crossed an ethical line, and removed her from the case. A10

Fight Over National Park Hunt
Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, is fighting to preserve an agreement by the National Park Service to close 45,000 acres of parkland on Santa Rosa Island, Calif., to the public for hunting, August through December. A15

Lettuce Recalled for E. Coli
Less than a week after the Food and Drug Administration lifted its warning on fresh spinach grown in the Salinas Valley, a popular brand of lettuce grown there was recalled over concerns about E. coli contamination. The lettuce does not appear to have caused any illnesses, the president of the grower said. A10

Senator's Finances Questioned
For the past five years, Senator George Allen, Republican of Virginia, has failed to tell Congress about stock options he received for his work as a director of a high-tech company. Congressional rules require senators to disclose all deferred compensation, like stock options. A13

HEADLINE: North's Test Seen as Failure For Korea Policy China Followed

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Monday, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
The North Korea nuclear test amounted to a major failure for China, which mounted one of its most extensive diplomatic efforts in years to find a negotiated solution to the North Korean nuclear crisis and to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula. 
 The Chinese expressed their anger in unusually strong terms, saying the test was ''flagrant and brazen.''
 Last week, the foreign ministry spokesman, Liu Jianchao, took the unusual step of publicly warning North Korea not to follow through with its planned test. Chinese leaders had also warned of ''grave consequences'' if the test was conducted.
 China and North Korea fought together against the United States and its allies during the Korean War and were ideological partners during the cold war. Today, China remains North Korea's most important source of food and oil.
 But China, which also has worked hard to keep good relations with the Bush administration, has tried to bring the United States and North Korea to the negotiating table. President Hu Jintao has met Kim Jong-iIl, the North Korean leader, several times, and the Chinese side tried to persuade the North Koreans to follow a strategy of peaceful opening that focused mainly on economic development, like the Chinese themselves did after Mao's death.
 The test will almost certainly force the Chinese to take a more assertive stance and to join the United States and regional powers into exerting more pressure on the North. 
 It remains unclear what leverage China might be willing to use against the North. Beijing has long argued that along with denuclearizing the country it also intends to preserve peace and stability there, and Chinese leaders are likely to reject any proposals for military action.
 They may also seek to water down any sanctions to ensure that restrictions on the North's trade do not topple the government, an event China fears could set off an influx of refugees and a volatile political environment on its border.

HEADLINE: South Korean Won't Need to Wait Long, Or Look Far, For First Crisis as U.N. Chief

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN and MARTIN FACKLER; Choe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul, and Martin Fackler from Hiroshima, Japan.

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
Ban Ki-moon, the soft-spoken South Korean foreign minister, has spent much of his 35-year career steering his country between its biggest ally, the United States, and its biggest threat, North Korea. Now, on the eve of his confirmation as the next United Nations secretary general, he is preparing to take on the North Korea portfolio on behalf of the world.
 With North Korea threatening to test a nuclear weapon, the next secretary general could face an early challenge to help defuse a standoff and coax North Korea to return to the bargaining table. He would also be called on to mend estranged relations with the United States, the largest donor to the United Nations, which have grown more strained with the war in Iraq.
Mr. Ban would become the second Asian to lead the United Nations, at a time when China's global influence is rising, and Japan, Asia's largest economic power, wants to raise its international profile by gaining a permanent seat on the Security Council. The last Asian secretary general was U Thant of Burma, the nation now called Myanmar. He served from 1961 to 1971. 
 So far, Mr. Ban has been characteristically reserved about disclosing what he might do as secretary general. He has said, though, that he would try to play a more vocal role than the current secretary general, Kofi Annan, in trying to persuade North Korea to end its nuclear program. He has also said he may depart from his predecessor's path by engaging North Korea in personal diplomacy.
 ''I plan to go to North Korea as soon as I get the chance,'' Mr. Ban, who is 62, was quoted as saying last Tuesday by the South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo. ''Secretary General Kofi Annan has never visited North Korea during his 10-year term.''
 The selection of Mr. Ban to lead the United Nations would place a seasoned diplomat at the helm of a sprawling organization with an annual budget of $5 billion and a presence in every corner of the globe, including 92,000 blue-helmeted peacekeepers, according to the latest figures from Jean-Marie Guehenno, under secretary general for peacekeeping. 
 Mr. Ban would also take over an organization reeling from criticism over mismanagement of the oil-for-food program in Iraq, reported sexual misconduct by peacekeepers and accusations of opaque and inefficient financial practices.
 But the biggest challenge Mr. Ban may face as secretary general could be his own personality. While no one doubts the South Korean diplomat's credentials, some have questioned whether his quiet, low-key manner is suited to the job. Known as a cautious consensus-builder, Mr. Ban would be taking a post with few formal powers, but one that has best served as a bully pulpit for swaying global public opinion.
 ''Personality is key for the success of any secretary general,'' said Yasuhiko Yoshida, a former United Nations official who is now a professor of international relations at Osaka University of Economics and Law. ''He must have a strong personality that is persuasive, to draw world attention to issues.''
 In a recent interview, Mr. Ban bristled at suggestions that he may be too mild-mannered to bring about the necessary change at the United Nations. He defended his preference for building consensus, saying that when he wants to criticize something, he first tries to determine whether ''7 out of 10 people'' agree with him.
 ''Then I go and make my point very clearly,'' he said, ''because I know I am right.''
 He added: ''Some Westerners may say I look soft and not pushy. But I remind them that an unreasonably strong character doesn't win respect.''
 Having won the approval of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council last week , Mr. Ban appears certain to replace Mr. Annan of Ghana, who will step down as secretary general at the end of this year. 
 Mr. Ban won four informal polls in the Security Council, coming out ahead of six other candidates. They all withdrew their names last week to clear the way for the formal selection of Mr. Ban by the Council on Monday. His name then goes to the 192-member General Assembly for approval. He would take office on Jan. 1. 
 South Korea has reacted with pride to Mr. Ban's apparently successful candidacy. In his hometown, Chungju, in the nation's center, people hung banners proclaiming him ''the favorite son of Chungju, the favorite son of the world!'' 
 Mr. Ban has risen in the estimation of diplomats with a combination of talent and quiet tenacity. As a teenager in 1962, he scored at the top of an English-language speech contest in South Korea, winning him a trip to the White House to meet President Kennedy. He said the visit only firmed up his resolve to pursue his childhood dream of becoming a diplomat.
 Han Seung-soo, a former South Korean foreign minister who has worked with Mr. Ban, described him as a gifted diplomat whose mild manner disguised an ability ''to make a very tough decision.''
 North Korea is already emerging as the first big crisis Mr. Ban could face. Last Tuesday, it escalated tensions by announcing that it would test its first nuclear bomb, provoking strong international condemnation. 
 As secretary general, Mr. Ban would have to assume a role different from the one he has played as South Korea's top diplomat. Since becoming foreign minister two years ago, he has not always seen eye to eye with the United States on the North Korean weapons program. 
 Mr. Ban has been an advocate of the policy of the South Korean president, Roh Moo-hyun, who has favored engaging North Korea in dialogue and using economic incentives to entice it to compromise. At times, this has put him at odds with the United States, which supports a tougher approach.
 ''His experience and position as South Korean foreign minister is quite different from his position as secretary general,'' said Soh Chang-rok, a professor at Korea University in Seoul, because Mr. Ban must ''act as a global public official with a neutral stance.''
 Mr. Ban is familiar with the United Nations, where he served for four years early in his career as first secretary at the South Korean mission, beginning in 1974. He has also worked at his country's embassy in Washington, and as director of the North American department of the Foreign Ministry. 
 He will need those American contacts to improve the United Nations' ties with the government in Washington, which frayed after the American-led attack on Iraq. Mr. Ban has also promised to mediate disagreements between the United States and third-world member countries. In what seems to be a nod to one of America's concerns, he has vowed to clean up the United Nations' financial management.
 ''I also know the criticism about inefficiency and corruption,'' he said. ''Through reform, the United Nations must be reborn as a viable and efficient organization so that it can properly deal with the challenges it faces in the 21st century.''

HEADLINE: No Language Barriers in a Dance Talk Fest

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA LA ROCCO

 BODY:
The seven people in the small conference room were punchy, having spent the last two days in intense, far-ranging discussions. Now, it was nearing 9 p.m. The beer bottles scattered around the congealing remnants of two pizzas outnumbered the remaining people two to one; earnest exchanges had given way to giggles. And another full day loomed.
 It was not a university cram session, but one of the more exciting international choreographic projects to develop in recent years: the Springdance Dialogue, visiting Dance Theater Workshop this month. 
The Springdance festival in Utrecht, the Netherlands, has been a fixture on the European festival circuit since 1978; it has been held every other year, since 1997. But only since 2000, under the directorship of Simon Dove, have the dialogues been added in off-years.
 ''I was looking at the role of the festival, and what it really needed to be responding to and responsible for,'' Mr. Dove explained last week by phone from Warsaw, where he was attending a conference. ''I felt as a presenting structure, we needed to look much more at the development of the work we were presenting -- not just waiting until work developed and then cherry-picking off the international market.''
 Springdance collaborates with organizations in different countries that recommend choreographers to assemble for several days of closed-door discussions, followed by performances. This New York session includes Dance Theater Workshop, its host, and Dance Agency TSEH in Moscow. All 10 choreographers, from the United States, Russia and various European countries, will present work, beginning tonight with a free studio showing by Nora Heilmann of the Netherlands. Since Wednesday, each has led a workshop presenting his or her work to the others, to focus on the difficulties and pleasures of making dances.
 The dialogues, which vary depending on participants' resources and interests, arose in 2000 from a question: how can established organizations help young, independent choreographers -- those not linked to an institution like an opera house or running a big company -- maintain their artistic integrity while sustaining careers? Mr. Dove said he hoped the dialogues would begin relationships in which participating organizations respond to the very specific needs of each artist. 
 For example, the American choreographer Jeremy Wade attended the Utrecht session in April; since then, with contacts and monetary support from the festival, he has moved from New York to Berlin, where he is working on a piece to be shown there and at Springdance. 
 On Wednesday the 10 choreographers met in one of Dance Theater Workshop's third-floor studios in Chelsea for a welcome brunch of bagels and cream cheese. Led by Andre Lepecki, who teaches performance studies at New York University, and the Romanian choreographer Mihai Mihalcea, they gathered in a circle, some sitting on zebra-stripe pillows, others on beanbag and folding chairs. The mood was anticipatory but anxious, with introductions punctuated by awkward pauses and laughter. Not everyone spoke English with ease; some barely spoke at all. Eduard Gabla from Romania listened intently, his pen poised over a notebook. But his brief introduction said it all: ''I'm open. I'm just open.''
 What followed was a sprawling conversation, thoughtful but halting, as people adjusted to various personalities and cultural contexts. 
 ''I almost get the feeling that in Eastern Europe, the situation is to create the institutions, while in Western Europe the need is to break them,'' Ms. Heilmann said at one point. ''Why do you want an institute of dance? They are the ones that restrict our movement.'' 
 She spoke in response to Mr. Mihalcea's comment that artists can influence governments, as happened when a few dancers demanded, and got, Romania's first national dance house, the National Dance Center Bucharest, which he directs. 
 Mr. Mihalcea, in turn, was responding to a more pessimistic sentiment. As the American Chris Yon said: ''Back in the 60's we all read about Judson Church, and that was a statement against the status quo. Now I feel I have no choice to make that statement; I have to perform in holes in the walls. That's an economic reality.''
 Many of the same themes were picked up in a discussion on Thursday night. Disagreements over the artist's political responsibility grew particularly passionate and revealing, as the American choreographer Levi Gonzalez wondered if making dances was enough in wartime. Ivana Muller, who now works in Amsterdam and Paris, said that when war started in her native Croatia, she and her peers realized that continuing their work was the most important thing they could do.
 Her fiercely political stance was at odds with the Russian choreographers, who, as Tatiana Gordeeva explained, ''never think to be involved in changing politics.'' Challenged by Ms. Muller, they explained that centuries of totalitarian rule had created that mentality. 
 The curious acceptance that is the overwhelming tenor of the Springdance Dialogue must be a tremendous relief to artists who often must justify themselves to everyone from grant givers to critics to relatives. But acceptance does not exclude rigor. ''It's somewhere between a really good, deep conversation with your best friend and being confronted at a university, where you have to clarify yourself, your position and your argument,'' Mr. Dove explained. ''Those things don't always tend to happen in polite conversations.'' 

Nora Heilmann performs today in a free studio showing; other shows are nightly through Saturday in the main theater at Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 924-0077 or dtw.org.

HEADLINE: Injecting a Bold Shot of the New on the Upper East Side

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
I expect Norman Foster's design for a new residential tower at 980 Madison Avenue to infuriate people. Rising out of the old Parke-Bernet Gallery building, a spare 1950 office building between 76th and 77th Streets, its interlocking elliptical forms throw down a challenge to a neighborhood known for an aversion to bold contemporary architecture.
 The tower's height, roughly 30 stories, hardly helps its cause; as with other luxury high rises reshaping the Manhattan skyline, its scale is clearly driven by economic considerations. Defenders will point out that the Carlyle Hotel across the street is slightly taller, but the reality is that the Carlyle's setbacks make it virtually invisible when viewed from the street. Lord Foster's tower would have a far stronger visual presence, soaring above the apartment buildings flanking it to the north and south. 
With a little trimming, though, this could be the most handsome building to rise along Madison Avenue since the Whitney Museum of American Art was completed 40 years ago. 
 The project approaches the existing building with gentleness, respecting its integrity without resorting to historical mimicry. And its glistening forms reaffirm the city's faith in progress, suggesting that Lord Foster has a better grip on what makes New York tick than architects who have worked in the city all their lives.
 Designed by Walker & Poor, 980 Madison's austere limestone facades and urban roof garden were meant to replicate the stylish look of Rockefeller Center, completed a decade earlier. But the building signals the end of an era, not a beginning. Its low, subdued profile is the antithesis of Rockefeller Center's soaring monumentality, giving it a curious sense of incompleteness. And within two years Manhattan would move on to embrace International Style Modernism with the completion of Lever House.
 The building suffered through a major renovation in 1960, when the roof garden was stripped away and replaced with a fifth floor whose horizontal windows clashed with the formal rhythm of the windows below. Yet even after the addition it retains a straightforward elegance, serving as a bridge between Beaux Arts monumentality and classical Modernism.
 Lord Foster was enlisted as someone who has handled sensitive historic sites, even if the results have been somewhat mixed. In his recent addition to the Hearst Building on Eighth Avenue he plunged a faceted 46-story office tower through the original 1920's structure with stunning force, and the collision between the two is mesmerizing. But an earlier design for the courtyard of the British Museum simply smoothed over the differences between old and new, an approach that benefited neither.
 Here, Lord Foster approaches the 1950 building with care, as if leery of riling old ghosts. The unfortunate fifth-story addition from the 1960's would be demolished to make way for a spectacular roof garden framed by lush grass. And the tower is set at the building's northern edge, closer to 77th Street, giving it a connection to the block between Madison and Fifth Avenues and preserving some of the current views from the Carlyle Hotel. 
 Most ingenious is the delicate way Lord Foster links the old and new structures. A slender exposed elevator core rises from the old building, connecting the 77th Street lobby to the glass tower. The tower's petal-shaped floors begin 30 feet above the old structure's roof level, so that the two buildings barely seem to touch. 
 The tower's underbelly forms an entrance canopy at one end of the garden. From the street it would seem as though the tower were floating above the old stone base, its elliptical shaft stretching up to the clouds.
 As with all of Lord Foster's recent buildings, the forms are generated by environmental as well as aesthetic considerations. The tower's interlocking ellipses and uneven heights visually reduce its scale, giving it a more slender profile as it rises. The elegantly curved forms were designed to limit wind resistance; the fluted glass cladding will collect solar energy.
 But the tower's outsize height is a problem. Manhattan was shaped by the hubris of developers struggling against the constraints of the street grid, and its beauty is a result of wild juxtapositions of scales, styles and architectural periods. But I'm not sure a luxury high rise should be allowed the same freedom as a major civic building. 
 Unlike Renzo Piano's planned addition to the Whitney Museum of American Art two blocks south, the Foster tower will serve the interests of a wealthy elite, not the public at large. We're not talking about, say, a project that addresses the city's desperate need for middle-class housing.
 And the argument that the tower's height is in keeping with the Carlyle's is misleading. One of Madison Avenue's most comforting features is the way its scale shifts as you walk north from the corporate towers of Midtown and approach its residential neighborhoods. You read the street differently as the pace and intensity slow.
 The tower need not conform to the height levels of its neighbors, but it should at least establish a visual dialogue with the 16-story residential tower immediately to the north across 77th Street. The challenge will be to scale back the height without sacrificing the elegance of the tower's slender proportions.
 These decisions will play out in haggling between the developer, Aby Rosen, and the Landmarks Preservation Commission, not in a design studio. (The building lies within the landmarked Upper East Side Historic District; the commission plans a public hearing on the project on Oct. 24.)
 Lord Foster is not a social critic; his job, as he sees it, is to create an eloquent expression of his client's values. What he has designed is a perfect monument for the emerging city of the enlightened megarich: environmentally aware, sensitive to history, confident of its place in the new world order, resistant to sacrifice.
 Still, you cannot help but marvel at the project's sophistication as a work of architecture.

HEADLINE: Crashes May Rise When Alcohol Sales Ban Is Lifted

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS BAKALAR

 BODY:
States that repeal blue laws prohibiting the sale of packaged alcohol on Sundays may find themselves subject to a sharp increase in alcohol-related vehicle crashes and fatalities on that day of the week, a new study has found.
 Many state legislatures have repealed Sunday sales laws in recent years. Advocates have argued that the elimination of the restrictions would actually reduce alcohol-related fatalities, since people could drink at home and would not risk driving after drinking in a bar or restaurant. 
But a study published in the November issue of The American Journal of Public Health does not support that view, citing the results of an analysis carried out in New Mexico, where it was illegal to sell packaged liquor on Sundays until July 1, 1995.
 ''Based on our investigation, we would anticipate that if states were to lift bans, you could anticipate an increase in crashes and fatalities,'' said Garnett McMillan, the lead author of the study and a researcher at the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, a nonprofit public health research organization.
 Alcohol sales regulations vary widely by state and locality, and some jurisdictions have different sales rules for wine, beer and hard liquor. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, only 15 states still retain complete bans on Sunday package sales.
 The researchers analyzed all alcohol-related automobile crashes in New Mexico from July 1, 1990, to June 30, 2000, using police and toxicology reports. Of the 492,396 crashes during the observation period, 45,596 were alcohol related. Although less than 10 percent of all accidents, they accounted for 2,341 of the 4,620 fatalities.
 Then the scientists looked at the daily data, comparing Sundays before and after the repeal of the package sales laws. For Sundays alone, they found a 29 percent increase in alcohol-related crash rates and a 42 percent increase in alcohol-related fatalities. No other day of the week showed a statistically significant change in either crashes or fatalities.
 ''That there was no change on any other day of the week,'' Dr. McMillan said, ''is really the most compelling evidence.''
 David M. Ozgo, chief economist for the Distilled Spirits Council, a trade group, disputed the findings, saying there has been a steady decline in New Mexico both in alcohol consumption and alcohol-related fatalities. By 2005, he wrote in an e-mail message, the percentage of alcohol-related fatalities as a percentage of all fatalities declined to under 40 percent from 65 percent in 1990. Per capita alcohol consumption also declined to a little more than 1.72 gallons a year, from 1.82 gallons in 1991.
 ''They're making progress on drunk driving, and alcohol consumption is going down,'' Mr. Ozgo said in a telephone interview. ''So where exactly is the harm? When we look at declining consumption and declining fatalities, their correlation just doesn't lead anyone to any logical conclusion about causality.''
 Mr. Ozgo also questioned at least one of the study's underlying assumptions. ''There's no good evidence that people drink packaged alcohol as soon as they buy it,'' he said.
 Dr. McMillan and his co-author, Dr. Sandra Lapham, acknowledge that the determination of which nonfatal accidents are alcohol related depends partly on subjective observations by police officers at the scene. But that would not apply to fatal crashes, for which alcohol involvement is determined by tests for blood alcohol concentration, they said.

HEADLINE: Bronx Odyssey: From Rebel to Executive to Felon

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Charles Rosen has had the kind of life story that could be found only in New York City. 
 The son of Eastern European immigrants with strong Communist sympathies, he dropped out of college, worked as a night-shift newspaper typographer in the mid-1970's and emerged as leader of a 13-month rent strike at Co-op City that roiled state leaders and fueled the political careers of a future governor and a future state attorney general.
But now, this former champion of the working class has admitted to having enriched himself through a city-subsidized charity set up to help children, teenagers and the elderly. 
 On Thursday, Mr. Rosen, 63, pleaded guilty in State Supreme Court to felony charges of grand larceny and forgery and to a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of government administration. The crimes were part of what city investigators describe as a widespread pattern of fraud and mismanagement at the charity, the Gloria Wise Boys and Girls Club, which Mr. Rosen led from 1993 to 2005. 
 Hillel J. Valentine, a member of the charity's board of directors from its founding until this spring, said the two-year investigation was emotionally devastating. ''I was so close to Charlie and the family -- and his wife and his three daughters and his brother,'' said Mr. Valentine, a retired police officer. ''Because I was so close to him and know the good that he did, and know the good he could have done, I'm more than mad -- I'm disappointed.''
 Mr. Rosen declined to comment for this article, but in an e-mail message that he sent on Sept. 14 to some close friends and associates, he expressed regret and contrition.
 ''There's no crying over spilled milk,'' he wrote. ''I did some dumb things. I trusted some people who many told me to get rid of.''
 Mr. Rosen has agreed to pay a fine of $5,000 and make restitution of $38,575, a fraction of the $69,000 the city's Department of Investigation said he stole. The agreement does not provide for jail time. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for Dec. 6. 
 Jeffrey Aulenbach, deputy director for operations at Gloria Wise from 1999 to 2005, also pleaded guilty to larceny and obstruction. 
 Mr. Rosen's plea marks an ignominious turn in a remarkable life. 
 His father emigrated from Poland, his mother from Ukraine, according to a June article on Co-op City in The New Yorker. 
 Both parents worked in the garment industry and, like many other Jews from Eastern Europe, had an affinity for left-wing politics. Mr. Rosen's father, a former anarchist, was kicked out of the Communist Party after he set up a small garment shop here, and Mr. Rosen's mother was a Socialist, a Zionist and then a Stalinist. They raised Charles and his brother, Jacob, speaking Yiddish and loathing Leon Trotsky.
 Charles Rosen, who attended public schools and left college without a degree, was a night-shift typographer on the production floor at The New York Post, when it was a left-leaning newspaper. He and his wife, Lynn, moved from the Upper West Side to Co-op City in the Bronx on Dec. 31, 1970.
 Co-op City had opened in 1968. It was the brainchild of Abraham Kazan, a Russian immigrant and union activist who recognized a pressing need for decent housing for garment workers crammed into slum housing on the Lower East Side, according to Joshua B. Freeman, a historian at the City University of New York Graduate Center.
 The development, with 15,372 units, became a quagmire. ''Poor planning, shoddy construction, inadequate supervision and widespread reports of corruption plagued Co-op City,'' Dr. Freeman wrote in ''Working-Class New York: Life and Labor Since World II'' (New Press, 2000). 
 The project was built under the state-aided Mitchell-Lama program, which financed moderate-income housing using low-interest mortgages and tax abatements.
 Facing the refusal of tenants to pay a 25 percent increase in their monthly maintenance fees in 1975, the state -- which became caretaker of Co-op City after the board of Mr. Kazan's organization resigned -- moved to foreclose on the property. That could have led to the loss of residents' equity and could have exposed them to eviction.
 ''We'll defend our homes,'' Mr. Rosen declared, calling the state's bluff. ''What will they do, bring in a platoon of police or the National Guard?''
 Judges fined Mr. Rosen and the strike leaders, to no avail. Robert Abrams, then the Bronx borough president and, from 1979 to 1993, the state attorney general, tried to mediate, as did Mario M. Cuomo, then the secretary of state and, from 1983 to 1995, the governor. 
 Finally, the strike ended in 1976 with a compromise. The tenants would pay $20 million in withheld fees, take over management of the complex and set their own fees, but they agreed not to increase the sizable debt they owed the state. 
 ''He was an outspoken, charismatic leader at the time, selected by the people,'' Mr. Cuomo said yesterday of Mr. Rosen. ''There had been various political skirmishes within their group, but in the end Charles was their spokesman.''
 Representative Eliot L. Engel, a Bronx Democrat who lived in Co-op City during the strike, recalled Mr. Rosen as being ''very bright, very smart,'' but also ''very ruthless'' and dismissive of his opponents.
 ''Everybody knew he was very out of the mainstream in his political beliefs,'' Mr. Engel said. ''He didn't make any bones about it. We all knew he was sympathetic to the Chinese and the Soviets, and maybe that was part of his allure to some people.''
 The strike made Mr. Rosen one of the most powerful figures in the Bronx, and it led to the downfall of an assemblyman, Alan Hochberg. In 1976, Mr. Hochberg, a Democrat, was convicted of offering Mr. Rosen a $20,000-a-year do-nothing job with the Assembly, a promise of a $5,000 contribution for a future political campaign and a $3,000-a-year job for Mr. Rosen's brother-in-law, if Mr. Rosen agreed not to run against Mr. Hochberg. 
 For several years, Mr. Rosen was chairman of the RiverBay Corporation, the company created to manage Co-op City. In 1977, he recruited Gloria E. Wise, a civil-rights activist and social work administrator, to form and lead an after-school program that became known as the Youth Activities Committee. 
 In 1992, as Ms. Wise was dying of brain cancer, she turned over the organization to Mr. Rosen, who became executive director in 1993. According to the city, he started to draw a salary in 1994, the same year the committee became a member of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.
 Under Mr. Rosen, the organization -- renamed in 1996 for Ms. Wise, who died in 1993 -- grew rapidly. In 1995, it allied with Goose Bay, an early-childhood group that grew from one center with four classrooms to four centers with 17 classrooms. In 2000, it took over two senior centers within Co-op City. In 2004, it absorbed another charity, Pathways for Youth. 
 ''The combined entities had over 700 employees and annual budgets totaling approximately $20 million,'' the Department of Investigation said in a report released on Thursday.
 Mr. Rosen's salary also grew. From $109,477 in wages and bonuses in 2000, his pay rose to $249,611 in 2004, according to federal tax records.
 The Department of Investigation concluded that he and four other executives ''stole or improperly obtained'' $244,616 from the charity. Mr. Rosen took $69,000, from 2001 to 2004: $14,000 used to buy a Volvo convertible, $21,000 for home furnishings and the renovation of a waterfront apartment in the Rockaways, and $34,000 drawn from off-the-books bank accounts that he opened under the pretext of supporting youth athletic programs.
 Mr. Rosen told investigators that the charity's board had granted him a $400 monthly car allowance toward a Volvo convertible he bought in August 2002, and that he continued to pay for the Volvo through payroll deductions. But according to the investigators' report, he still owed the charity more than $14,000 for the car -- which he kept after resigning in June 2005.
 According to the city, four bank accounts set up by Mr. Rosen and Mr. Valentine were used to pay bonuses for the five executives at the charity, including a $33,850 payment to Mr. Rosen in 2002. (Mr. Valentine was not implicated in any wrongdoing.) 
 In his plea on Thursday, Mr. Rosen admitted to falsifying reimbursements for expenses submitted to the city and state ''for sports programs that the nonprofit never conducted.'' He also admitted to falsifying business records submitted to investigators who were looking into $875,000 that the charity improperly lent Air America Radio, a fledgling liberal network, in 2003 and 2004.
 Mr. Rosen's lawyer, Frederick H. Cohn, said, ''The report by D.O.I. is grossly inaccurate and, were he not a convicted criminal, borders on libel.'' Mr. Cohn did not offer evidence.
 In his e-mail message, Mr. Rosen invoked the memory of Ms. Wise and said he had raised $7.3 million to build a community center, as well as $7.5 million for the New York State Alliance of Boys and Girls Clubs. 
 He concluded: ''I don't know what my future will bring; I can't think that far ahead. I am on autopilot. I am here. After 15 months' unemployment I have to consider earning a living, establishing a place for myself in a world I never thought I would have to face from this vantage point.''

HEADLINE: American Wins Nobel In Economics

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Edmund S. Phelps, a Columbia University professor, was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science yesterday for his contribution to a sophisticated explanation of how wages, unemployment and inflation interact with one another. 
 The explanation holds, in essence, that wages and inflation tend to rise in tandem, one pushing up the other, until the unemployment rate reaches an ''equilibrium'' or ''natural'' level at which prices no longer rise.
 These trade-offs are often considered by Federal Reserve policy makers in setting interest rates and are still a central element of mainstream economic thinking. But the relationships among these factors have eroded over time, many economists say, contributing to assertions from both the left and the right that the Fed has sometimes gone too far in squeezing economic growth in pursuit of a theory that no longer fits the real world. 
 Mr. Phelps, who is 73, is a latecomer to the Nobel for work in this field. He elaborated in the late 1960's on a concept first introduced by A. William Phillips, a British economist. Mr. Phillips described, in a 1958 paper, how lower unemployment pushes up wages and vice versa. The trade-off came to be known as the Phillips curve, and the name stuck through various permutations.
 Mr. Phelps brought inflation into the equation, and also inflationary expectations. So did Milton Friedman, almost simultaneously, and in the Nobel that Mr. Friedman won in 1976, this work was included in the citation. 
 ''Ned Phelps was clearly on everybody's short list to win a Nobel,'' said Robert M. Solow, himself a Nobel laureate in economics. 
 Six Nobels for 2006 have been awarded so far, and all have gone to Americans. Mr. Phelps, in addition, is the fourth economist at Columbia to win a Nobel in the last decade. The award, which carries a prize of $1.37 million, also cited his work in analyzing the intricate relationship between behavior and expectations and the role of investment in education and research. 
 But Mr. Phelps was mainly recognized for his contributions to an understanding of the trade-offs involving inflation, wages and unemployment. He offered more detail than Mr. Friedman about how expectations are formed and how they are affected by incomplete knowledge. 
 Neither workers nor managers have enough information, Mr. Phelps found, to accurately assess what is happening to wages and prices and each, in making its demands, is susceptible to miscalculation.
 ''I've tried to put people into economic models by being more realistic about the situations in which they find themselves,'' Mr. Phelps said in an interview yesterday. He learned of the award in a 6 a.m. telephone call from Stockholm where the Swedish Academy of Science, which selects Nobel winners, has its headquarters.
 ''My wife took the call and passed the phone to me,'' Mr. Phelps said.
 The Phillips curve, as elaborated by Mr. Friedman and Mr. Phelps, holds in effect that in the early stages of a wage-price spiral, both workers and managers settle for increases that are less than actual inflation. But gradually a wage-price spiral develops, and prices rise without any change in the unemployment rate.
 Finally, there is a reaction. As the economy heats up, central bankers step in to push up interest rates in an effort to control inflation by slowing the economy. The unemployment rate begins to rise, and if the nation is lucky, unemployment settles at the natural rate, which means the rate at which inflation holds steady.
 In the 1980's and early 90's, economists put this natural rate as high as 6 percent, and the Fed, aiming for this target, sometimes ended up pushing the economy into higher unemployment and recessions. 
 ''For me,'' Mr. Solow said, ''there was really only one short period, in the 1970's, when this theory really worked.''
 Employers then had more power to raise prices than they do in today's global economy, and workers had stronger unions to help them bargain for higher wages. ''Since the 1970's,'' Mr. Solow said, ''the natural rate of unemployment, this key rate, has been very unstable.''
 Indeed, Fed policy makers found in the 1990's that unemployment could fall much more than they anticipated without causing inflation to escalate.
 ''At this point,'' said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute, ''the concept does more harm to the country than good.''
 Mr. Phelps himself has become less than enchanted by his findings. ''The 'natural unemployment' rate,'' he said, ''leaves people with the idea that there is no hope. It is an act of nature that cannot be repealed by man.''
 Mr. Phelps was born in Evanston, Ill., but at age 6 he moved to a New York suburb, Hastings-on-Hudson, after his parents lost their jobs in the Depression and his father found a new one in Manhattan.
 At Amherst College, he took a course in economics to please his father, and found himself hooked, particularly by the issue of unemployment. He received his Ph.D. from Yale in 1959 and joined the Columbia faculty in 1971 after teaching stints at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania.
 He and his wife, Viviana Montdor Phelps, an interpreter fluent in four languages, have lived for 32 years in a three-bedroom apartment overlooking Central Park. They own neither a car nor a country home, not wanting the bother of maintaining a second residence, Ms. Phelps said. They like to travel, including trips to Argentina, his wife's native country.
 ''We never had enough money to buy an apartment as large and as comfortable as the one we live in,'' she said, ''and the rent for this one is relatively low.''

HEADLINE: North Korea and the Bomb

 BODY:
Let us all agree: North Korea's government is too erratic, too brutal, and too willing to sell what it has built to have a nuclear bomb. There is also no military solution, not least because intelligence experts haven't a clue where Pyongyang has hidden its weapons labs or its stock of plutonium. 
 So after years of temporizing and denial, the world's leaders need to figure out how to force this terrible genie back into the bottle. It is a truism that no country that has tested a nuclear weapon has ever been pressured or cajoled into giving it up. But neither has any nuclear postulant been as vulnerable to outside pressure and bribery as this regime.
The Bush administration seems to want to impose limited sanctions on North Korea -- and inspections of all cargo going into and out of the country -- until it agrees to abandon its entire weapons program. We fear that won't be enough to quickly change Pyongyang's mind -- while key players like China won't sign on to never-ending punishments.
 We believe this must instead be a two-step process, starting with a Security Council-ordered ban on all trade, until the North agrees to stop expanding its arsenal. Pyongyang must be told that there will be no further attempt at negotiation until it halts all plutonium production, forswears additional tests and readmits United Nations inspectors.
 In practice, the North Koreans are likely to back down only if China chokes off their oil supply and other essential trade. Until now Beijing has refused to use its enormous leverage, fearing that too much pressure could topple the North Korean government and unleash a mass of refugees over its border. When told they were enabling their neighbor's nuclear ambitions, Chinese diplomats blithely insisted that the North was likely bluffing about having a weapon. Now, Washington, Tokyo, Moscow and others have to make clear that China will be judged by its willingness to confront this problem. 
 The Security Council must also make clear that it is still demanding the complete dismantlement of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program. For that, negotiations are the only hope. It is impossible to know whether North Korea will give up its weapons at any price. But it has never been tested -- mainly because the Bush administration has not made the sort of serious offer, including security guarantees, that might make a bargain worthwhile. 
 The administration has indulged in its own denial and temporizing. Last year, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice dismissed the North's declaration that it had nuclear weapons as a bid for attention. ''I do think the North Koreans have been, frankly, a little bit disappointed that people are not jumping up and down and running around with their hair on fire,'' she told The Wall Street Journal. 
 Since then, United States policy has whipsawed between negotiations and posturing, incentives and sanctions. It has been months since negotiators even sat down at the table. Administration hawks suggested last week that perhaps the best thing would be for the North to test, so the world would know exactly what it was dealing with. The hawks appear to have gotten their way. So why don't we feel safer?

HEADLINE: A History of Sex With Students, Unchallenged Over the Years 

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI; Sandra Jamison contributed research.

DATELINE: BAYONNE, N.J. 

 BODY:
Many in this gray, insular city are at a loss to explain why Diane Cherchio West was allowed to continue working in the public school system for two decades after she was caught in 1980 kissing and groping a 13-year-old student at an eighth-grade dance.
 Why, after her promotion to guidance counselor at Bayonne High School, no one alerted social services, school officials or the police when she became pregnant by an 11th grader she supervised, Steven West, and married him upon his graduation in 1985.
Or why, when that baby, Steven Jr., grew to be a teenager, no one balked as his 15-year-old friend moved in with Ms. West, who then seduced the friend with Scooby-Doo boxer shorts and evening jaunts to sports bars and used her school authority to rearrange his classes around their secret trysts. 
 It was not until 2001, when relatives of the boy, Christopher Castlegrande, filed a complaint with the police of statutory rape against Ms. West, that she left her $74,000-a-year job and lost her unfettered access to Bayonne High School's students. 
 After Ms. West was arrested, school officials insisted for more than a year that the allegation was the only accusation of misconduct in a sterling 24-year career. They allowed her to take an early retirement package that fattened her pension, and gave her a farewell party with cake and ice cream. When Ms. West pleaded guilty in 2005 to sexual assault charges, glowing references from co-workers, supervisors and friends helped persuade a judge to sentence her only to probation. She was also spared the ordeal of having to register as a sex offender. 
 Now, with Mr. Castlegrande suing the school district for failing to protect students from a woman with a sexual appetite for under-age boys, this city of 62,000 has been forced to examine how little was done to stop her earlier. Even as the news media were saturated with coverage of teachers like Pamela Smart and Mary Kay Letourneau who slept with their students, Bayonne averted its eyes for years.
 Some blame small-town politics; Ms. West's father is a prominent businessman here. Others see a double standard in which people are reluctant to view teenage boys as victims. Mayor Joseph Doria attributes the silence to shock, shame and misplaced civic pride from people afraid the case would tarnish the reputation of Bayonne schools.
 ''No one bothered to do the math,'' said Mr. Doria, who, like many people in town, knew that Ms. West had married a former student, but did not seem to realize that the relationship had started -- and that their child had been born -- when her husband was still in school. ''And the people who suspected didn't want to make it a big issue.''
 The legal age of consent in New Jersey is 16 -- except if the adult is acting in loco parentis, like a teacher or guardian, in which case it is 18.
 Bayonne, on a peninsula jutting between Upper New York Bay and Newark Bay, has an assortment of Irish, Polish, Italian, Egyptian and Hispanic enclaves crammed next to one another yet separated by language, culture and economic status. Ms. West, now 52, was raised in one of the city's more comfortable Italian sections, the daughter of John Cherchio, a regular on who's who lists here, who ran a successful construction and waste-carting business. 
 Ms. West declined repeated requests to be interviewed for this article, and her lawyer did not respond to several telephone messages left at his office. Nor did her father, or his lawyers.
 But court records summarizing her presentencing psychiatric evaluation say Ms. West described her upbringing as happy and uneventful until age 14, when she became pregnant by an abusive boyfriend and gave the child up for adoption.
 By 23, Diane Cherchio had graduated from college and was a special education teacher at Dr. Walter F. Robinson elementary school. Her intelligence and dedication won the admiration of supervisors and colleagues, who told investigators decades later that they had been stunned to see her pawing at a 13-year-old student named Jorge at an eighth-grade dance.
 The school principal at the time, Daniel Doyle, swore in a statement to prosecutors last year that he spoke to a half-dozen teachers and became convinced that she and the student were sexually involved. ''Diane has a thing for young boys,'' Mr. Doyle recalled being told, according to court records. 
 Mr. Doyle said in the statement that he wrote to the superintendent asking that Ms. Cherchio be fired, but was startled to learn, upon returning to school in the fall, that she had instead become a guidance counselor at the high school. 
 ''I accepted it as a political maneuver,'' said Mr. Doyle, now retired, who grew up near the Cherchio family. He added that he suspected her father's business and political connections allowed her to escape punishment. 
 But the superintendent who promoted Ms. Cherchio, James Murphy, said in a recent interview that he does not know her father, and was never pressured by city officials. Mr. Murphy insisted that he was never told about the accusations, adding, ''That's a very serious matter, and I would have treated it that way if I had been informed of it.'' 
 Neither school officials nor Mr. Doyle can locate any written report about the episode.
 At Bayonne High School, the young counselor's enthusiasm when helping with class schedules and college applications -- along with her fashion sense and fluency in pop culture -- made her a hit with students, according to interviews with several faculty members. When she became pregnant in 1984, former colleagues recalled, she said that her baby's father was a musician in the hit musical ''Beatlemania.'' 
 Within months, however, another story began to circulate. According to records in the Hudson County prosecutor's office, Mary Cerreta, an elementary school teacher, had heard from her niece that Steve West, then a junior at the high school, was an expectant father; Mr. Doyle, the elementary school principal, heard from his stepson that the mother-to-be was his -- and Steve's -- guidance counselor.
 Asked about the relationship years later by a court-appointed psychiatrist, Ms. West said that when they met, Steve had been recovering from a suicide attempt and she had been desperately lonely. ''I looked at it like we were saving each other,'' she said, according to the summary in the court file. 
 In his statement to prosecutors, Mr. Doyle said he was shaken by the news that his former employee had again become sexually involved with a student. But he said he did not report it to school administrators or legal authorities because his previous complaint had accomplished nothing. ''She was somebody else's problem now,'' he is quoted as saying in the statement. 
 Diane Cherchio was 31 when she married Steve West after his graduation. The couple became fixtures on West 26th Street, said James Rentas, who lived across the street. In the years that followed, they were often seen walking the family's terrier or hurrying their three children to soccer and baseball practice. 
 But the unusual thing neighbors noticed was the large bay windows that the Wests had installed on the side of the house overlooking the Bayonne High School athletic field. On many afternoons, they said, Ms. West watched intently as the football, baseball or soccer teams practiced.
 By the spring of 2000, one star on that baseball diamond was Christopher Castlegrande, a freshman so burly and quick with a bat that he became the varsity's starting catcher.
 Though he excelled athletically, Chris had a learning disability and a troubled home life. 
 Ms. West, who had been divorced since 1996, was close to Chris's father, Joseph Castlegrande, their sons having played Babe Ruth baseball together. When Mr. Castlegrande complained about his debts and his strained relationship with his son, according to his statements to the authorities, Ms. West invited Chris to live with her and her three children. 
 Now 21 and considering a career in law enforcement, the younger Mr. Castlegrande declined to be interviewed for this article, along with his lawyer, Robert Bianchi, his father and the aunt and uncle who reported the affair to the police. Mr. Castlegrande also sued Ms. West -- who settled for $400,000 last year, according to court records -- and then the Bayonne district and its top administrators, in a civil case now pending in federal court in Newark. 
 According to Ms. West's and Chris's statements to the authorities at the time of her arrest, several weeks after the teenager moved in, she sat next to him on the couch while watching television, put her hand on his leg and kissed him. Within a week, the statements say, they were having sex.
 At school, Chris told investigators, Ms. West rearranged his classes so they could meet at home during lunch. She wrote him excuses for absences and hall passes, and gave him her electronic security card to enter and leave the school building. ''Stick with me, I can get you into a good school and get you a baseball scholarship,'' she told him, according to Chris's statement to the police.
 At home, Ms. West fluctuated between surrogate mother and secret lover. Chris told the authorities that she had opened a bank account for him, had taken him on vacations to Utah with her children, had set his curfew and bedtime, and had helped arrange an operation on his foot. And, several times a week, he said in the statement, she sneaked him into her bedroom to spend the night.
 Eventually, according to the police statements from Chris and Ms. West, Steven Jr. grew troubled by the close relationship, so Chris moved in with an aunt and uncle.
 The aunt, Tammy Laszkow, told prosecutors that she was suspicious that the relationship between Chris and Ms. West had turned sexual and began secretly recording Chris's telephone calls from her home. In December 2001, Mrs. Laszkow taped Ms. West reading Chris a newspaper article about a boy who had shot his father during a hunting trip, and began to fear for Joseph Castlegrande's life, so she called the police. 
 In talking about the relationships with a court-appointed psychiatrist last year, Ms. West said that when she took up with Steve and Chris, she thought it was acceptable because she had had a child at 14. Later, she said, she realized teenage boys can suffer emotional damage if they become sexually involved with an adult, especially an authority figure like a teacher.
 It is unclear what lessons, if any, Bayonne school administrators took from the episodes because they, too, have declined to discuss the matter, citing the pending lawsuit.
 Like many who live here, Enrique Santana, 21, who played baseball with Mr. Castlegrande and had Ms. West as a counselor, said he was shocked to learn about the relationship -- but not about the tepid response.
 Asked whether he was confident that the town would be more vigilant in protecting children like his own daughter in the future, he shrugged. ''Even if you knew, really knew it was happening at the time, who could you go to?'' Mr. Santana said in an interview. ''This is Bayonne, a small town.''

HEADLINE: Polled And Confused

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
You may have heard that American voters are disappointed. They are disappointed with Dennis Hastert and the rest of Congress. They are very disappointed with the war in Iraq. They are very, very disappointed with President Bush.
 I share their unhappiness, but I must confess to one further regret. I am disappointed with the voters -- or at least the ones who show up in public-opinion polls. They keep complaining that Washington doesn't understand what they want, but who on earth could?
Early in the Iraq war, Americans told pollsters they favored it and considered it a major part of the war on terrorism. Then they decided the war was a mistake and didn't reduce the risk of terrorism. Yet as they got angrier and angrier at Republicans for making a mess of Iraq, they kept telling pollsters that they didn't trust the Democrats to do a better job of dealing with terrorism. 
 Their feelings on the economy are even harder to fathom. In the New York Times/CBS News poll released yesterday, a solid majority of voters said the economy was doing well. When asked if they were making enough to pay their bills and sock away savings, they also sounded upbeat -- more upbeat than the respondents 10 years ago who were asked that question when the White House was in Democratic hands. 
 Yet this year's respondents solidly disapproved of Bush's handling of the economy and said they trusted Democrats to do a better job of it. In part, the reaction reflected the generalized anger at Bush and Republicans. But there's another factor, too: the voters like each party for the wrong reasons.
 They can't break their old prejudices. They still think of Republicans as the tough, worldly realists best able to deal with foreign enemies, and Democrats as the compassionate idealists protecting the little guy at home. At one time these stereotypes made sense, but not anymore.
 The Republicans have become Wilsonian idealists in foreign policy, the neoconservative innocents abroad who thought they could quickly transform the Middle East. A few Democrats have tried proposing more pragmatic foreign policies -- like treating terrorism as a law-enforcement problem, not a war -- but most are terrified of sounding weak because they read the polls.
 Despite the Republican failures in Iraq, voters maintain their longstanding mistrust of Democrats' handling of foreign policy. Vic Fingerhut, a Democratic pollster working in battleground states, reported Sunday in The Washington Post that swing voters overwhelmingly trust Republicans on Iraq, terrorism and other foreign policy issues.
 On the domestic front, voters still trust Democrats to deal with issues like education and Social Security even though the Democrats have run out of ideas. Their basic educational strategy is to spend more money and keep teachers' unions happy. They have no plan to keep Social Security solvent, except ''taxing the rich,'' which won't do the trick. 
 The G.O.P.'s Social Security plan last year would have left the poor better off than under the current system, but Republicans couldn't overcome their image as the cruel despoilers of the Democrats' New Deal. They did succeed (with President Clinton's grudging cooperation) in reforming welfare. That did more to break the cycle of poverty than anything done during the Great Society, but in voters' minds the Democrats remained the party of compassion.
 Republicans fought to improve schools at the local level by giving more choices and power to students, parents and principals. These reforms (like vouchers and charter schools) were popular in places where Republicans overcame the resistance of Democrats and teachers' unions, but in national polls, voters preferred Democrats to deal with education. 
 So President Bush abandoned the party's principles and made a deal with Ted Kennedy to enact the No Child Left Behind law, a centralized Democratic-style plan that gave the Republicans a brief boost in the polls. Like previous Democratic plans for reviving education with regulations from Washington, it was an expensive flop, but voters still tell pollsters they trust the Democrats to fix the schools.
 Maybe someday a candidate with Republican domestic policies and Democratic foreign policies will miraculously catch fire with voters. For now, the best hope is for a return to divided government and gridlock, so that each party can stop the other from fulfilling its poll-driven agenda. 
 Of course, if that happens, voters will be complaining to pollsters about how little gets done in Washington. But they won't be as disappointed as they are now.

HEADLINE: Tough Talk From Seoul, If Little Will For a Fight

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Tuesday, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
South Korea warned on Monday that it would ''sternly deal'' with North Korea's announcement that it conducted a nuclear test, saying the action could lead to a ''nuclear arms buildup'' in the region.
 President Roh Moo-hyun said South Korea would coordinate its response with other countries, though he did not give details and suggested that he was not ready to give up yet on his country's ''sunshine policy'' of engaging North Korea. 
''This is a grave threat to peace, not only on the Korean Peninsula but in the region,'' said Mr. Roh, whose government has been accused by critics both in and outside South Korea of coddling North Korea.
 Mr. Roh said South Korea ''has lost ground in arguing for dialogue'' against calls for stronger punitive measures, including economic sanctions, against North Korea.
 On Tuesday morning, Mr. Roh went further by saying in a statement that ''a reconsideration of our engagement policy is needed.''
 The government's response to the nuclear test was firmer and quicker than its reaction to North Korea's missile launchings in early July, when Mr. Roh remained silent for days and avoided harsh criticism.
 Still, there was some ambiguity in his remarks, and experts in South Korea remained divided Monday over whether a nuclear test would simply re-emphasize the hard reality that the policy of engagement is the lesser of evils in dealing with its unpredictable and irascible neighbor.
 The two Koreas were fierce cold war enemies until the late 1990's. But the ''sunshine policy'' under Mr. Roh and his predecessor, Kim Dae-jung, has transformed South Korean attitudes. Increasingly, North Koreans have been viewed here as misunderstood cousins who must be prodded into behaving, and a national consensus has emerged that pits South Korea against the Bush administration, which has sought to isolate and confront North Korea.
 ''There is a general consensus in South Korea, not only among politicians but also in the general population, that engagement is the right policy,'' said Han Sung-joo, a former ambassador to the United States. ''But it doesn't mean we have to rationalize this nuclear test.''
 Mr. Han said that in the near future, South Korea's assistance to the North would probably have to be limited to relief aid. He said that plans to expand major projects to help North Korea develop its economy would probably be put on hold.
 Analysts said that North Korea's action would weaken Mr. Roh and the governing Uri Party, but that the damage would not decisively help the opposition Grand National Party. 
 ''When you look at the opposition's policies toward North Korea, you see that they are 95 percent in agreement with the ruling party's,'' said Choi Kang, a security expert at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul. ''Both emphasize the need to push the North to democratize, to reform internally, by engaging it. What differs is the means. The opposition emphasizes the need for reciprocity -- it shouldn't be unconditional.''
 ''It's too premature to say this is the end of the engagement policy,'' Mr. Choi said. 
 South Korea's priorities remain peace and stability on the peninsula, so few South Koreans favor confronting North Korea and possibly causing a military conflict or its collapse. The United States, in contrast, is concerned about nuclear proliferation. 
 ''Does South Korea share these concerns?'' said Andrei Lankov, a Russian expert on North Korea at Kookmin University in Seoul. ''No. If some crazy regime in Central America goes nuclear, or if terrorist groups or rogue states obtain nuclear arms, South Korea will never become a target. 
 ''In the short term, South Korea will have to show solidarity with the international community and freeze exchanges with the North,'' he added. ''But then they will start looking for a pretext to resume exchanges.''
 Others contend that the American unwillingness to negotiate directly with North Korea, as the North has sought, is to blame for the failure to soften North Korea's stance.
 ''That's why hard-liners in the North Korean government have gained a stronger voice,'' said Han Hong-koo, a historian at Sungkonghoe University in Seoul.

HEADLINE: Army and Other Ground Forces Meet '06 Recruiting Goals

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
One year after the Army failed to meet its annual recruiting goal by the widest margin in two decades, the Pentagon is to announce this week that the ground forces, and the rest of the military, all reached their targets for recruits in 2006.
 Weakness remained in filling the reserves, however. The Marine and Air Force Reserves topped 100 percent of their goals, although the Army National Guard hit 99 percent of its target. 
For active-duty forces, the Army signed up 80,635 people in the 2006 fiscal year, which ended at midnight on Sept. 30, topping its goal of 80,000. The Navy recruited 36,679, after setting a goal of 36,656. The Marines enlisted 32,337, with a goal of 32,301, and the Air Force recruited 30,889, topping its goal of 30,750.
 ''The big question out there is, 'How did you guys do better in '06 if you fell short in '05?' '' the top Pentagon personnel officer, David S. C. Chu, said. ''And yet we have a very demanding set of deployments going on overseas. And, if anything, the nation is more debating this issue of war against terrorism and our deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan than was true in 2005.''
 Cash bonuses are often cited as the primary incentive for recruits, and Pentagon statistics indicate that two-thirds of those who sign up receive bonuses. Mr. Chu noted that successes occurred in a strong economy.
 ''Opportunities for young people have gotten better and better,'' he said. ''They are choosier.''
 To encourage national service and the choice of a military career, additional recruiters were hired last year. Mr. Chu said the real challenge for the Defense Department was persuading adult ''influencers'' like parents and school counselors to advocate, or at least support, military service by young Americans.
 ''If we don't deal with this influencer issue successfully, we will have very difficult challenges ahead of us,'' he said.
 Some efforts to reach recruiting goals brought criticism, especially Army decisions to raise recruits' maximum allowable age and to accept a larger percentage of applicants scoring at the lowest acceptable range on a standardized aptitude examination.
 The Army also offered large bonuses to recruits signing up for particularly dangerous assignments, including up to $40,000 for soldiers willing to drive convoy trucks in Iraq.
 The active-duty Army recruiting goal of 80,000 was the same target as in 2005, a year in which the service fell short of enlistments for the first time since 1999. 
 Across the reserve component, the Air Force Reserve recruited 6,989 people, well over its goal of 6,607, and the Marine Corps Reserve topped its goal of 8,024 by signing up 8,056. The Air National Guard reached 97 percent of its goal, signing up 9,138 people, beneath a target of 9,380, and the Navy reserve attracted 9,722 people, just 87 percent of its goal of 11,180.
 Officials paid particular attention to the Army National Guard members, who may be mobilized for service in war zones as well as for national emergencies, and for the Army Reserve.
 The Army National Guard approached its goal of 70,000 by recruiting 69,042, while the Army Reserve hit 95 percent of its goal, recruiting 34,379 of a goal of 36,032.
 On retaining military personnel, Mr. Chu said, ''People who have elected to join the military are willing, despite the burdens we have asked them to bear, to continue serving.''
 The Army, Air Force and Marines exceeded their retention goals, the Pentagon said. Lt. Gen. Robert L. van Antwerp Jr., commander of the Army Accessions Command, responsible for recruiting and initial training, said the Army had ''defied the odds'' by meeting its active-duty recruiting goals in the 2006 fiscal year as civilian jobs have been more plentiful across the nation.
 In an interview at his headquarters at Fort Monroe, Va., General van Antwerp described how the Army hired 1,000 recruiters, swelling their ranks to 6,500. The Army college fund remains a big draw, he added. 
 The Army has been criticized for raising the allowable age for recruits to 42, from 35. General van Antwerp said no more than 500 new soldiers were in that category. 
 The Army also raised the limit on the percentage admitted into the service from the lower aptitude ranking, increasing the percentage to the Defense Department limit of 4 percent of recruits from 2 percent. 
 General van Antwerp said the decision allowed the acceptance of some otherwise qualified recruits whose deficiency was in English-language skills, not mental aptitude.
 Some recruits also signed up after the Army waived criminal records that would have previously barred them. The Army said waivers would not be granted in cases of a pattern of offenses, as well as for people convicted of drug trafficking and sexual crimes.
 Pentagon personnel officers and Army officials said a continuing focus and new ideas would be needed to meet the recruiting targets.
 One idea under consideration is to offer a signing bonus that could be used solely for a down payment on a house, a feature that Army officials say would appeal to parents of potential recruits more than the unrestricted bonuses that new soldiers might spend on items like stereo systems or motorcycles.
 The Army also announced a new advertising slogan. ''Army Strong'' replaces the previous motto, ''An Army of One.''

HEADLINE: As Religious Programs Expand, Disputes Rise Over Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES; Andrew Lehren and Donna Anderson contributed to this article.

 BODY:
The similarities between Holy Cross Village at Notre Dame, on the north side of South Bend, Ind., and Hermitage Estates, south of town, are almost disorienting. The two retirement communities have the same simple gabled ranch houses, with the same touches of brick and stone, clustered around a pond with the same fountain funneling spray into the air and ducks waddling down the grassy bank.
 But the retired residents of Hermitage Estates pay an average of about $2,300 per unit in property taxes. The management of Holy Cross Village, the Brothers of Holy Cross, says that development should be exempt from property taxes, and it has taken that argument to court.
As the Brothers of Holy Cross, a Roman Catholic religious order, sees it, providing the elderly with the amenities of the village -- a sense of security, social opportunities and various services to make independent living easier -- is a charitable activity rooted in its pastoral mission to serve others. 
 Members of the St. Joseph County Property Tax Assessment Board of Appeals, all but one of them lifelong Catholics, see it differently. To them, a charitable ministry does not consist of providing lovely retirement living to affluent people. The current residents of Holy Cross Village have an average net worth of $1 million. Those with deposits on the units under construction are even better off, averaging $1.6 million.
 If Holy Cross Village is not taxed, members of the assessment board point out, a heavier burden will fall on the working families in the county that are struggling to pay the taxes on their small homes in careworn communities like the west side of South Bend.
 ''I was educated by the Brothers of Holy Cross'' at St. Joseph's High School, ''and I have a great deal of respect, love and affection for them,'' said Dennis J. Dillman, a longtime board member. ''But I think what they're doing is just not right. And that is based on the values they taught me at their schools.''
 The conflict in South Bend echoes disputes from Alaska to Florida that raise the following issue: As religious organizations of all faiths stretch their concept of mission far beyond traditional worship, should their traditional tax exemptions expand as well? Increasingly, government at all levels is answering yes.
 The property tax exemption is one of the oldest tax breaks granted to religious organizations, but it is not the only one. Lawmakers and judges have also approved what amounts to special tax treatment for religious organizations and some of their employees, including exemptions on personal-income and payroll taxes, and have made it easier for them to get tax-exempt construction loans for purely religious projects.
 Like the exemptions from federal and state regulations that have proliferated for religious groups in recent years, these tax breaks are widely defended both as an acknowledgment of religion's contributions to society and as a barrier to unjustified government limitations on the liberty that religious organizations enjoy under the First Amendment.
 But in some communities like South Bend, tolerance of religious tax breaks is fraying as local governments struggle to provide basic services with limited resources.
 There are no national figures on how much money these tax breaks save religious organizations and on how much extra cost is shifted to other citizens. But a typical state, Colorado, reported that religious real estate valued at more than $1.1 billion was exempt from local property taxes there last year. Nationally, tax-exempt financing for religious organizations totaled at least $20 billion during the decade that ended last year. 
 Congressional budget records show that just the income tax breaks uniquely available for ministers, rabbis and other clergy members cost taxpayers just under $500 million a year.
 And the price is almost certainly increasing, experts on taxation and congregational growth agreed, because today's larger congregations need more land, employ more clergy members and pay them more money. Moreover, the definition of a religious mission is expanding beyond schools and hospitals to include operations as obscure as a biblical theme park in Florida and as upscale as a retirement community at Notre Dame.
 Every state affords some type of property-tax exemption to churches, synagogues, mosques and other religious landowners, typically through statutes that also cover charities, libraries, museums, private schools and other secular nonprofit groups. Indeed, when the Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of this tax break in 1970 it noted approvingly that the benefits did not fall exclusively on churches.
 But those venerable tax statutes did not envision the reality of modern congregations that operate athletic programs in their own gymnasiums or fitness centers, as well as bookstores, music and video production units, coffee shops, counseling services, ice cream parlors, child care programs and multimedia ministries that beam their messages from satellite dishes or television transmission towers.
 Leonard A. Wychocki, president and chief executive of the Franciscan Sisters of Chicago Service Corporation, a Catholic organization hired to manage Holy Cross Village, says religious groups should not have to defend property tax exemptions. ''When there were old people on the streets of New York City and Chicago, our sisters took them in,'' he said. The exemption recognizes ''the service such groups provide to society.''
 No residents of Holy Cross Village will be coming in off the streets, of course. ''People pay a lot of money to live in these places,'' Mr. Wychocki acknowledged. ''But they have a need beyond just a place to live. It's around that need that we catalyze our services.'' 
 Financial projections show that the project, if managed well, could eventually generate a surplus. That money, the project's executives said, could help support other mission work of the Brothers of Holy Cross, including a ministry in Africa.
 ''If the county wants to argue that those dollars should go to west South Bend rather than West Africa, I can see their point,'' Mr. Wychocki said. ''You may agree or disagree -- but then it's your judgment, as opposed to the brothers' judgment.''
 He added, after an emphatic pause: ''This is probably where religious freedom kicks in.''

Breaks on Property Taxes
 Neat homes in landscaped clusters make up the first phase of what will be 256 units at Holy Cross Village at Notre Dame. Among the new units will be additional assisted-living and skilled-nursing units to expand the existing ''continuum of care,'' its management said. Three adjacent colleges, the University of Notre Dame among them, expand the cultural opportunities.
 In style and luxury, the project compares favorably with competing retirement communities built by national developers nationwide. But there is a difference: Holy Cross Village describes itself as ''a ministry of Brothers of Holy Cross.'' As such, it is seeking a property tax exemption from the Property Tax Assessment Board of Appeals for St. Joseph County. 
 That rankles Ralph J. Wolfe, an assessment board member who is a resident of Hermitage Estates, a 49-unit neighborhood of retirees whose homeowners association provides services including maintenance and lawn care.
 Mr. Wolfe, 77, is a retired tax assessor and a longtime veteran of the close-knit appeals board. He said his community, like Holy Cross Village, offers its retirees some amenities. ''So maybe we should get ourselves a property tax exemption.''
 He seemed to be teasing Terrance F. Wozniak, the deputy county attorney for St. Joseph County, who was listening. One of Mr. Wozniak's biggest worries about losing the pending battle with Holy Cross is the ripple effects on the retirement communities in the county that do pay taxes.
 The Indiana courts recognize a broad definition of charity, and exemptions already have been granted to a few much smaller religious-affiliated projects that care primarily for less healthy people, Mr. Wozniak said. But this case is different, he said: ''It's a case of escalation.'' An exemption for the charitable care of needy older citizens is being stretched to cover ''more and more luxurious facilities for people who, by and large, can pay their fair share.'' 
 Each case lowers the hurdle for what constitutes a tax-exempt retirement community, he said.
 The management of Holy Cross Village thinks the project's mission fits well within both the Indiana definition of a ''charitable purpose'' and the federal standards for tax-exempt housing providers. The federal test requires, in part, that the project ''be committed by established policy'' to maintaining people as residents even if they become unable to pay, as the project's investment documents explain. 
 There is nothing in writing that guarantees the project will keep indigent residents in place, said Lori McLaughlin, general counsel for the Franciscan Sisters management group. ''It becomes a case of those guarantees bankrupting you,'' she said.
 But in lieu of a guarantee, the management has ''nuns or brothers on the board saying, 'We insist you provide care,' '' Mr. Wychocki said. ''It would be very rare for anybody to be asked to leave.''
 Holy Cross Village initially paid the taxes the county demanded, but subsequently got court permission to hold off on future payments while its appeals go forward, according to Kevin Rose, a spokesman for the project's management.
 When the Brothers of Holy Cross appealed the county's ruling to the Indiana Board of Tax Review last year, it lost. ''A charitable purpose involves something beyond merely successfully marketing one's services to seniors,'' the review board said. ''It implies some level of sacrifice on the part of the entity providing those services. It is this sacrifice that separates an 'obviously charitable act' from the everyday purposes and activities of man in general.''
 The fight has now moved to the courts, where the project's management hopes to fare better. ''We thought we were within the orbit of what was considered to merit that exemption,'' Mr. Wychocki said. ''Now we just stand and shake our heads.''
 While local tax authorities have been inconsistent in their rulings, many untraditional uses of land by disparate religious organizations of many faiths have already qualified for property tax exemptions somewhere in the country.
 In June, for example, the Florida Legislature passed, and Gov. Jeb Bush signed, a law that ended a five-year effort by Orange County tax authorities in Orlando to collect about $300,000 a year in property taxes from Holy Land Experience, a biblical museum and theme park that had sought exemption as a religious ministry but had been repeatedly turned down by the county.
 The park, where a pass good for a week costs $35 for adults and $23 for school-age children, advertises itself as a place that ''brings the world of the Bible alive.'' Its features include replicas of Calvary, the tomb of Jesus and the caves where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found. It also includes a period re-creation of a Jerusalem street market, with actors in costume as the merchants and buyers; and the KidVenture area, with a wilderness rock-climbing wall, a ''misting station'' and toy and gift shops. A cafe and two snack bars serve ''real Middle Eastern fare'' from couscous and falafel to Goliath Burgers.
 The county property appraiser's office had insisted that the park, despite its biblical motif, was taxable, just like Disney World. The park's founder, the Rev. Marvin J. Rosenthal, argued that it was a religious mission from start to finish, aiming to introduce religion to people in an entertaining and enlightening way.
 In July 2005, a local judge ruled against the county, saying the biblical park's intent was to ''spread what it considers to be God's word,'' while the intent of Disney World ''is indisputably to make money.'' When the county decided to appeal that decision, the ministry that operates the park lobbied successfully for relief in Tallahassee. 
 A spokeswoman for Governor Bush said he signed the bill ''merely to prevent future legal action and provide clarification of the law'' on exemptions for religious property.
 In 2003, the Minnesota Tax Court granted an exemption to an elaborate fitness center owned by the Country Bible Church in Ashby, explaining that the center -- which included a weight room, tanning bed, video arcade and bookstore, as well as a small auditorium and prayer room -- was used to attract new church members.
 The church, with about 250 members, has a broad range of programs for children and teenagers, including a day school and toddler program. But it decided in 1996 that its rural location simply did not offer enough for young people, and it conceived the Destiny Center as a place where young people could form healthy habits and ''strong, godly friendships,'' according to its pastor.
 ''We've spent close to $1 million, including the building and staff, and we've never broken even,'' said the Rev. Steven R. Quernemoen, who founded the church 25 years ago. ''But the goal is not to run a for-profit business. The goal was to open a facility that is a safe environment for young kids and families.'' 
 The two-story center, with a center gable soaring high over the entrance, opened in October 2000 a few miles from the church. Besides its fitness facilities, it has a gymnasium that offers room for rock concerts and for family events like wedding receptions, reunions or birthday parties. A day pass costs $4.69, including shower privileges. An annual family membership costs $500, but the elderly pay about half that. It is open most mornings and after school through the week, but is closed all day on Sunday.
 Similarly, in 2002, the Washington State courts granted a tax exemption for the site of a religious broadcaster's transmission tower. And in January the Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed a 1959 decision that had denied tax exemptions to parking lots that serve houses of worship.

Legislative Success
 Some religious organizations have had equal success with state legislators.
 The Anchorage Baptist Temple, which has grown to 4,500 members during the 35-year tenure of the Rev. Dr. Jerry Prevo, is a big, muscular church on a 20-acre campus in eastern Anchorage. Its complex includes a 2,100-seat auditorium, several gymnasiums, a television station and the Anchorage Christian Schools, which serve about 750 students from preschool to 12th grade. The church also owns an assortment of individual properties, 10 of them tax-exempt.
 In April 2004, city tax assessors revoked the exemption for four church-owned homes they said did not qualify as ''parsonages'' because they housed church day-school teachers, not the pastors or other ''spiritual leaders'' specified by law.
 ''We are a high-profile church,'' said Pastor Prevo. ''We were being picked on to make a public statement against tax exemptions generally.''
 Any group as large as Anchorage Baptist Temple would probably have no trouble getting help from state lawmakers, even if its pastor did not have his own television show and even if one of the 16 men on its pastoral staff were not treasurer of the state Republican Party. Last May, after vigorous lobbying by the congregation, the Republican-controlled Alaska Legislature passed and Gov. Frank H. Murkowski signed a bill that extends the parsonage exemption to church-owned residential property occupied by educators at private religious or parochial schools.
 The exemption, which does not cover faculty housing at secular schools, has been challenged in court by the local American Civil Liberties Union. 
 It is a tough fight, a lawyer for several big churches said, because a legislature that can constitutionally exempt a parsonage from the tax rolls can surely extend that exemption to homes a church provides to its schoolteachers.
 And back in St. Joseph County, Ind., the Granger Community Church, a large United Methodist group, took exception to the county's enforcement in 2001 of a long-overlooked law that limited the amount of tax-exempt acreage around a church to 15 acres -- which left the church with 14.54 acres still on the tax rolls.
 It lost in the courts but carried its fight to Indianapolis, and helped push through changes that eliminated the 15-acre cap.

Breaks on Borrowing
 The Rev. Russell Lievers of the First Southern Baptist Church in Clarksville, Ind., a town of 22,000 across the Ohio River from Louisville, Ky., is understandably excited about the new fellowship hall his church is building. 
 At a price of roughly $2.5 million, the facility will contain a ''middle-school-sized'' gymnasium, he said, as well as a kitchen, meeting areas and classroom space. It will ease crowding at the 57-year-old church and open possibilities for new athletic ministries and outreach, he added.
 Pastor Lievers is not familiar with the details for financing the new facility -- but he knows the church has received a good interest rate on some of the money it is borrowing. That's important, he said, because ''our people are giving sacrificially'' to support the new facility.
 ''There are people who are delaying their retirement for a few years to help us build this,'' he continued. ''Others are postponing purchases so they can give more.''
 The explanation for the church's low-cost financing is simple. It is relying on $1 million in tax-exempt revenue bonds sold on its behalf by the town of Clarksville, through its economic development commission.
 ''It is the first time we've had a church apply,'' said Samuel K. Gwin, the town attorney. ''But most of us here on the town council and economic development commission were familiar with the church, and the folks in the church. It's a small town.''
 The church bond issue is structured like any economic development deal: the town sells tax-exempt bonds to an investor -- in this case, a local bank -- willing to accept a lower yield because the interest is tax-free. The town lends the lower-cost money to the church. The bank gets tax-free interest income, the church gets a lower-cost loan and the town gets -- well, at the least, a new gymnasium the community can use when the church's calendar permits.
 ''That will be good,'' Mr. Gwin said. ''Even the Y is pretty crowded.'' 
 In the evolving view of the courts, tax-exempt bonds for churches and other religious organizations do not involve any public money or government subsidy and do not run afoul of the First Amendment ban on government-sponsored religion.
 But in fact, the subsidy provided by all tax-exempt bonds, while indirect, is real: buyers of the bonds do not have to pay income taxes on the interest they earn, which shifts some of the overall tax burden to other taxpayers. And the final beneficiary of the bond issue -- in this case, the church -- can hold on to money it would otherwise have paid in interest.
 Of all the tools that an accommodating government can use to make life easier for religious organizations, perhaps none has changed more and been noticed less than tax-exempt bond financing.
 State and local governments have long used tax-exempt bonds to finance public works like bridges and schools, pledging future tax income to repay the debt. In the 1970's, they began to rely heavily on revenue bonds, debt backed not by taxes but by the future revenues of the projects they were sold to finance, which ranged from airports to stadiums. Through economic development agencies, revenue bonds also were sold for the benefit of private businesses to finance factories or office buildings that would foster economic development.
 In 1973, near the high-water mark of the doctrine of strict church-state separation that dominated the postwar decades, the United States Supreme Court gave its limited blessing to public revenue bond deals to benefit private religious colleges -- so long as they were not ''pervasively sectarian'' and regarded education, not the promulgation of religion, as their primary purpose.
 In a landmark case called Hunt v. McNair, the court reasoned that ''aid normally may be thought to have a primary effect of advancing religion'' -- which would be unconstitutional -- if it went to ''an institution in which religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission, or when it funds a specifically religious activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting.''
 As recently as 1991, the Virginia Supreme Court refused to approve tax-exempt financing for Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., founded and run by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, because of its overarching religious purposes.
 Then, over the next eight years, judicial and government policy made a U-turn.
 Gradually, state bond statutes became less restrictive toward religious institutions and federal and state appeals courts started to permit tax-free financing at unabashedly religious universities -- and later, religious high schools -- so long as the money was used for firmly secular projects, like dormitories and dining halls. (California courts have held on to the ''pervasively sectarian'' standard, but three religious schools are currently challenging that approach before the State Supreme Court.)

Does Financing Count as Aid?
 And the courts began to widely question whether tax-exempt financing even counted as government aid to religion at all, because the schools themselves had to repay the bonds and no public money was involved.
 In June 2000, Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for himself and three other justices, expressed second thoughts about denying tax-free financing to institutions based on how religious they were. ''There was a period when this factor mattered, particularly if the pervasively sectarian school was a primary or secondary school,'' he conceded. ''But that period is one that the court should regret, and it is thankfully long past.''
 A few months later, the Virginia Supreme Court reversed the position it had taken nine years earlier in the Liberty University case and approved tax-exempt bond financing for the construction of a campus for Regent University, a thoroughly sectarian institution founded by Pat Robertson, the religious broadcaster who also founded the Christian Coalition. The Virginia justices did balk at permitting Mr. Robertson to use public bond financing for his department of divinity; that would have to be financed in some other way, they said. 
 But that reluctance seems quaint these days. Early 2005 brought the sale of $28.5 million worth of tax-exempt bonds issued by Cook County, Ill., to finance the construction of an academic center for the Catholic Theological Union, the largest Catholic graduate school of theology in the United States.
 The new building, which a seminary spokeswoman said would open this fall, includes space for the world-class Bechtold library of theology, spacious classrooms for religious study and ''a worship area that has a sacred space for the entire community to gather,'' according to the news release about its grand opening.
 According to Jeffrey O. Lewis, a lawyer with Ice Miller in Chicago and the seminary's bond counsel for that deal, ''The 'pervasively sectarian' restriction began to fall apart in the late 1990's, and quite a few firms are very comfortable doing seminary financing now.''
 So it was perhaps inevitable that a local government would provide tax-exempt financing to an institution as indisputably sectarian and devoutly religious as the First Southern Baptist Church in Clarksville. ''Nobody raised any questions about it at all,'' recalled Mr. Gwin, the town attorney.
 A search of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's database shows that more than $20 billion in tax-exempt bonds have been sold since the late 1980's on behalf of religious institutions or their affiliates, including deals benefiting a Jewish vocational workshop in Michigan, a Baptist retirement home in Arizona, a Presbyterian housing project in Missouri, Lutheran nursing homes and day care centers in Minnesota and Catholic schools in Rhode Island. 
 In one recent deal, the city of Olathe, Kan., agreed to sell more than $83.5 million in tax-free bonds to help an affiliate of the Archdiocese of Kansas City finance Santa Marta, described as a Catholic ''continuing care retirement community'' with 162 units for independent living, 32 assisted-living units, a 32-bed nursing home and a swimming pool.
 Except for the swimming pool, Santa Marta sounds a lot like Holy Cross Village at Notre Dame, whose property tax status is being disputed by the tax assessment appeals board in St. Joseph County. They certainly have this in common: Most of the money needed to build Holy Cross Village has been borrowed at favorable interest rates through the sale of a $40 million tax-exempt bond -- issued by the economic development commission of St. Joseph County.

In God's Name
 Articles in this four-part series examine how American religious organizations benefit from an increasingly accommodate government.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Assesses Responses, Including a Possible Blockade 

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
Now that North Korea seems to have made good on its threat with what appears to be a nuclear test, United States military commanders and civilian policy makers are refining plans in the event that President Bush orders a blockade of North Korean shipments to prevent the sale of a completed bomb or nuclear components.
 Senior officers say Navy and Air Force combat and surveillance equipment are already in the region, and more could be deployed rapidly. 
Still, any unilateral effort by the United States to cordon off North Korea by sea and air could founder along the country's lengthy land border with China.
 ''This is a tough question,'' one senior official with years of experience in military planning said Monday, speaking as did others on the condition of anonymity because he was discussing classified war plans. ''The only good options were before North Korea got the bomb. There are no good options now.''
 For five decades, the American military has written war plans and deployed forces for a worst-case situation in the Korean peninsula: a major artillery, missile and ground attack from north to south across the demilitarized zone.
 But a conventional war is no longer the most pressing military threat. It is nuclear proliferation.
 Many staff officers contend that North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear programs are not primarily intended as part of a plan for a land attack on South Korea.
 If anything, North Korea probably regards its effort to develop a nuclear arsenal as a deterrent against an attack by the United States.
 The North Korean nuclear efforts could also be intended to press South Korea for diplomatic and economic gain, and to hold Japan, another important American ally, at risk, gaining even more leverage against the United States.
 Given that geopolitical geometry, American military officers and senior policy makers say, the Pentagon's abilities in the region, along with those of South Korea and Japan, are sufficient against the shifting North Korean military threat.
 While land combat is not an imminent threat, Pentagon and military officials say, the prolonged deployments of ground forces in Iraq and Afghanistan have doubtless complicated planning for the Korean Peninsula.
 Should more ground forces be required for South Korea, only a handful of combat brigades stand ready in the United States, Pentagon and military officials say. To bolster the force, additional combat units now getting ready for tours in Iraq could be pointed to the Pacific instead, with troops already in Iraq staying there longer than planned.
 Although the decision to move a full combat brigade of American ground forces from South Korea to Iraq in 2004 generated much public debate on the peninsula, the Pentagon more quietly has shifted substantial numbers of heavy Air Force bombers and attack aircraft from the United States to bases throughout the region to offset the decrease in ground forces. The Air Force's stealth bombers, with intercontinental range, are also available from their base in the American Midwest.
 Navy aircraft aboard carriers in the Pacific are on call, as are submarines equipped with a range of conventional and nuclear missiles. The most modern Patriot antimissile batteries have also been assigned to the region, as well as Aegis cruisers with abilities designed to track and shoot down missiles.
 ''Taken together, this has added a tremendous amount of capability more appropriate for the threat right now,'' a senior Defense Department official said. 
 Pentagon officials acknowledge that the sustained deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan have heightened the risks that would be faced if there were a Korean conflict because important equipment is committed to the Middle East.
 Weapons systems that officers call ''enablers'' are routinely in short supply and are heavily engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan; they include intelligence equipment like the pilotless Predator surveillance aircraft. Likewise, large stockpiles of precision-guided munitions have been placed within striking range of Iraq and Afghanistan. While those weapons are also in the Pacific arsenals, senior officials would have to weigh the risk to both military theaters and decide how best to allocate limited resources.
 Even senior commanders agree that the commitments to Iraq and Afghanistan have imposed risks on the American military, an assessment contained in a classified report to Congress last year from the departing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Richard B. Myers.
 General Myers wrote that the concentration of troops and advanced weapons in Iraq and Afghanistan limited the Pentagon's ability to deal with other potential armed conflicts.
 Major combat operations elsewhere in the world, if ordered by the president, still would succeed -- but would be more protracted and would produce higher casualties among American forces and foreign civilians, General Myers wrote. A range of senior officers have said that assessment still stands.
 One of the most significant and worrisome complications is that American intelligence agencies have no confidence that they can locate all of North Korea's weapons depots, development laboratories, nuclear command centers and leadership hide-outs -- though American intelligence abilities are said to have worried the North Korean leadership in the past.
 American intelligence officials concluded that Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, went into hiding during the final buildup to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 because he feared that he, too, might be tracked and attacked.
 After North Korea's newest announcement, military analysts continued Monday to assess whether its announcement that it had tested a nuclear device, in defiance of international opinion, represented a calculation by Mr. Kim that he was less vulnerable now -- or that he needed to join the elite club of declared nuclear powers to deter a possible American attack.

HEADLINE: Mutually Assured Disruption

BYLINE: By David Frum. 
David Frum, a speechwriter for President Bush from 2001 to 2002, is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and the co-author of ''An End to Evil: How to Win the War on Terror.''

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE North Korean nuclear test -- if that indeed is what it was -- signals the catastrophic collapse of a dozen years of American policy. Over that period, two of the world's most dangerous regimes, Pakistan and North Korea, have developed nuclear weapons and the missiles to launch them. Iran, arguably the most dangerous of them all, will surely follow, unless some dramatic action is soon taken.
 It is, alas, an iron law of modern diplomacy that the failure of any diplomatic process only proves the need for more of the process that has just failed. Thus those who have long supported negotiating with North Korea are now calling for the Bush administration to begin direct talks with the Kim Jong-il regime. Sorry, but all this would accomplish would be to reward an actual proliferator in order to preserve the illusion that the world still has a meaningful nonproliferation regime. 
Some even suggest, in worried tones, that the North Korean test might provoke Japan to go nuclear, as if the worst possible consequence of nuclear weapons in the hands of one of America's direst enemies would be the acquisition of nuclear weapons by one of America's best friends.
 A new approach is needed. America has three key strategic goals in the wake of the North Korean nuclear test. The first is to enhance the security of those American allies most directly threatened by North Korean nuclear weapons: Japan and South Korea.
 The second is to exact a price from North Korea for its nuclear program severe enough to frighten Iran and any other rogue regimes considering following the North Korean path.
 The last is to punish China. North Korea could not have completed its bomb if China, which provides the country an immense amount of food and energy aid, had strongly opposed it. Apparently, Beijing sees some potential gain in the uncertainty that North Korea's status brings. If China can engage in such conduct cost-free, what will deter Russia from aiding the Iranian nuclear program, or Pakistan someday aiding a Saudi or Egyptian one?
 To meet these three goals, the United States should adopt four swift policy responses:
 Step up the development and deployment of existing missile defense systems.
 The United States has already fielded 11 missile interceptors, nine in Alaska and two in California. The Navy has designed ship-based interceptors as well. As we well know, they are not perfect -- but they are something. 
 Until now this lack of perfection has been allowed to block full deployment of the technology. But missile defenses do not need to be perfect to complicate any aggressive action by a comparatively weak power like North Korea against the United States or its allies. 
 And deploying a missile defense of growing effectiveness also helps achieve another goal -- it would indirectly punish China by corroding the power of the missiles China uses to intimidate Taiwan.
 End humanitarian aid to North Korea and pressure South Korea to do the same. 
 Since 1995, the United States has provided more than two million tons of food aid to North Korea, plus considerable energy assistance. Officially, Washington says it has ''delinked'' its humanitarian aid from strategic concerns. Many United States officials believe that continuing this aid will sustain hopes for a better American-North Korean relationship in the future. Yet if the United States continues to send such aid even after an illicit nuclear test, North Korean leaders may well conclude that their aggressive actions have won them almost absolute impunity.
 An end to humanitarian aid would not only exact a considerable direct price from North Korea, but it would also hurt China. Chinese leaders often justify their refusal to pressure North Korea by citing the risk of an economic collapse that would send millions of refugees northward into China. We could call that bluff: if a North Korean economic collapse is a thing China fears, why should the United States and South Korea shoulder the cost of helping to avert it? Let China pay the full cost of underwriting its aggressive client state.
 Invite Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore to join NATO -- and even invite Taiwan to send observers to NATO meetings.
 Perhaps North Korea and China imagine that the nuclear test has tilted the strategic balance in the Pacific in their favors. Now would be a good time to disabuse each of them of any such illusion. We need a tighter and stronger security arrangement in the Pacific region, one from which rogue states and those who support them are pointedly excluded. The NATO allies have agreed to expand the organization well beyond Western Europe; now we need to persuade them to make it global. 
 Encourage Japan to renounce the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and create its own nuclear deterrent. 
 World War II ended long ago, and it's time to put an end to the silly pretense that today's democratic Japan owes a burden of guilt to today's rising China. A nuclear Japan is the thing China and North Korea dread most (after, perhaps, a nuclear South Korea or Taiwan). 
 Not only would the nuclearization of Japan be a punishment of China and North Korea, but it would go far to meet our goal of dissuading Iran -- it would show Tehran that the United States and its friends will aggressively seek to correct any attempt by rogue states to unsettle any regional nuclear balance. The analogue for Iran, of course, would be the threat of American aid to improve Israel's capacity to hit targets with nuclear weapons. 
 Countries like North Korea and Iran seek nuclear weapons because they imagine that those weapons will enhance their security and power. The way to contain them is to convince them otherwise. When nonproliferation can be prevented by negotiation, that is always preferred. But when negotiation fails, as it has failed in North Korea and is failing in Iran, rogue regimes must be made to suffer for their dangerous nuclear ambitions.

HEADLINE: Angry China Is Likely to Toughen Its Stand on Korea 

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
China's punctilious Foreign Ministry reserves the word hanran, which translates as brazen or flagrant, for serious affronts to the nation's dignity by countries that have historically been rivals or enemies.
 When the previous Japanese prime minister visited the Yasukuni Shrine, which China condemns as honoring Japan's World War II-era militarism, he was described as ''brazen.'' When the United States bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999, Beijing called that act ''flagrant.''
North Korea, a longstanding ideological ally, has had increasingly testy relations with China in recent years. But it was not until Monday, moments after North Korea apparently exploded a nuclear device, that China accused it of a ''brazen'' violation of its international commitments.
 The wording is just one indication that a nuclear test would cross a red line for China, which has devoted years of painstaking diplomatic effort, and staked its delicate relationship with the United States, on the premise that it could deliver a peaceful, negotiated solution to the nuclear standoff with North Korea. 
 That policy, Chinese analysts say, seems to have failed, and North Korea's action leaves Beijing little choice but to take a tougher approach. But Chinese leaders still see highly punitive sanctions as unpalatable and counterproductive, and the country's elite remains sharply divided over how far to distance China from its neighbor, and how closely to embrace the Bush administration, several senior Chinese foreign policy experts said.
 ''Hanran'' has been applied to North Korea for the first time. But Japan and the United States, which favor the sharpest response to North Korea's test, have been ''hanran'' for years.
 ''China is disappointed and angry and will be willing to support stronger sanctions,'' said Jin Canrong, a foreign policy expert at People's University in Beijing. ''But I think that is different from saying there will be a drastic change. It is still a question of the right balance.''
 The reason there is unlikely to be a major policy change, Mr. Jin and other experts here said, is that North Korea has sharply increased tensions without fundamentally changing China's calculation of its national interests.
 Its priorities remain, first and foremost, promoting internal economic development, the key to longevity for the ruling Communist Party. China's cautious, authoritarian leaders concluded long ago that generating high growth in its gross domestic product required a benign relationship with the world's major powers, secure borders and open markets -- in a word, stability.
 China would like to achieve a denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula but has shown few signs of accepting war or a forced change of government as an acceptable way to achieve that goal.
 ''The core of the issue is not nuclear weapons,'' said Shen Dingli, a leading security expert at Fudan University in Shanghai. ''The core of the issue is peace and stability. That is still strongly in China's interest.''
 While China has begun to think like a big power in some respects, its foremost strategic priority has been reclaiming Taiwan, or at least preventing the island from becoming formally independent of mainland China.
 Conflict in North Korea or the toppling of Kim Jong Il's government there could upset both of those goals, Chinese analysts say. A war is viewed as the worst outcome, potentially creating a wave of refugees into China and even risking a broader engagement that could threaten the extended period of harmony in Northeast Asia.
 Even peaceful change in North Korea could bring a new pro-American government to China's northeastern border as it faces continuing uncertainty over how to handle the pro-American government in Taiwan, off its southeastern coast.
 ''China must continue to look at North Korea through the prism of Taiwan,'' Mr. Shen said. ''You cannot expect China to abandon its ally completely while America continues to back Taiwan and allow the independence movement to thrive there.''
 But analysts say it also cannot afford to alienate the United States, and Beijing has recently taken steps to repair its frayed relationship with Japan. Those ties may well depend on moving to punish North Korea for its nuclear test, and at least experimenting to see if firm pressure on North Korea will bring it back to the bargaining table.
 China provides, by some estimates, 70 percent of North Korea's fuel and food and could almost certainly create severe economic hardship there by slowing shipments across its long, barren border.
 In addition, China has joined the United States in seeking to crack down on North Korean counterfeiting of American dollars and Chinese yuan, as well as on the use of Chinese banks to launder profits from illicit North Korean exports of drugs including amphetamines. Tighter financial sanctions could further deprive North Korea of already scarce hard currency.
 The question is how far down that path China can go, to maintain its cooperation with the Bush administration without foreclosing the possibility of luring North Korea back to negotiations.
 ''China has tried to persuade North Korea that talking with the outside world is in its interest,'' said Zhang Liangui, an expert on North Korea at the Central Party School, a research organization in Beijing run by the Communist Party. ''Now China will have to demonstrate that there is a price to pay for ignoring that advice.''
 Mr. Zhang said North Korea's announcement amounted to a slap in the face for China. Even if the goal remains a negotiated solution, he said, China must first show that it is prepared to take a much tougher line before North Korea will bargain in earnest.
 Susan L. Shirk, a State Department official responsible for East Asia during the Clinton administration, said she believed that the nuclear test could prove to be a turning point for China's approach to the problem. It will, she said, force China to choose between North Korea and a United States-led international consensus rather than split the difference between the two.
 She said the timing of North Korea's announcement -- the day after President Hu Jintao was visited by Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and said they had made progress repairing troubled relations -- also underscored the stakes for China's leadership.
 ''If they do not act strongly they could undo what they have worked to achieve with Japan, while also seriously straining relations with the U.S.,'' she said. ''North Korea has really boxed them in.''
 Even so, many Chinese analysts still view North Korea as a strategic asset. It may be irresponsible and unruly, but it belongs more to China than to the United States. Sacrificing an ally to help achieve America's goals of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons may require a much stronger consensus within the Chinese elite.
 ''I do not believe that Chinese leaders are willing to expend major political capital on this issue,'' Mr. Jin of People's University said. ''They would much prefer to follow the consensus. At the moment there is a heated debate, but no consensus of that kind.''

HEADLINE: Russian Deal to Create World's Biggest Aluminum Maker

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
Two Russian companies and a Swiss commodity trader announced a merger on Monday that would form the world's largest aluminum maker, overtaking Alcoa of the United States. 
 The deal continues a pattern in Russia of uniting companies separated in the breakup of the Soviet Union and the subsequent privatization in the 1990's into large, new monopolies, a crucial part of the economic policy of President Vladimir V. Putin.
Analysts say the mergers have been driven partly by national pride and partly by the efficiencies that large companies can create. 
 ''It's a very important deal for the image of Russia. It creates a global leader, No. 1. This is good for Russia,'' Aleksandr S. Bulygin, the chief executive of Rusal, who will have the same post in the merged company, said in a telephone interview.
 Like Gazprom and the government-owned oil company Rosneft, the new merged aluminum company intends to list shares on Western stock exchanges, leveraging its size and high commodity prices to get access to international capital. 
 Under the deal, Rusal, now Russia's largest aluminum company, would merge with its smaller domestic rival, Sual, and mining assets belonging to the Swiss company, Glencore, to create a company with an estimated value of $25 billion to $30 billion. It will be controlled by Oleg V. Deripaska, owner of Rusal and one of the country's richest men. 
 Sual is majority-owned by Viktor Vekselberg, another wealthy Russian. Glencore was founded by Marc Rich, the American commodities trader who fled the United States to avoid facing charges of tax evasion, racketeering and fraud and was pardoned by President Bill Clinton in January 2001. Glencore is now owned by its employees. 
 The new company intends to place shares on the London Stock Exchange in 18 months, executives said on Monday. Rusal would own 66 percent, Sual 22 percent and Glencore 12 percent. The annual revenue would be $10 billion, Mr. Bulygin said.
 The combined company, also to be known as Russian Aluminum, or Rusal, will produce about 4 million tons a year of aluminum for use in cans, foil and automotive parts, compared with the 3.5 million tons made by Alcoa in 2005. 
 The deal, which company executives said should be closed by April 1, would need regulatory clearance in Russia, the European Union and possibly the United States, along with Jamaica, Ireland and other countries where bauxite mines are located, Mr. Bulygin said. 
 Alcoa, based in Pittsburgh, is a century-old company and a storied name in American business. Alcoa's competitive edge has been dulled because the rising price of electricity, a major factor in the production of aluminum. 
 Rusal has a distinct advantage. Its plants are supplied with some of the world's cheapest electricity, produced by hydropower dams on Siberian rivers, a legacy of the Soviet Union's efforts to develop Siberia. That power is cheap because it is too far from any large city to be sold for higher prices to residential consumers. 
 The Russian company, now the world's third-largest by volume of production, will also leapfrog Alcan of Canada, the current No. 2. 
 Dmitry O. Afanasiev, a partner at the Russian law firm Egorov, Puginsky, Afanasiev & Partners, who was a lead negotiator on the merger, said the merger would better position the companies for an initial public offering. Separately, they would be valued comparably to developing-market aluminum companies, he said, but after the merger, the sheer size and prestige of being the world's largest will invite value comparisons with Alcoa and Alcan. 
 ''The foundation is being built for a very, very powerful company that will be the leader for many years to come,'' Brian Gilbertson, the chief executive of Sual, said on Monday. He will become the nonexecutive chairman of the merged company. 
 The goal, he said, is to raise cash through a public offering for a broad international expansion plan. 
 ''We have the financial resources,'' Mr. Gilbertson said, ''and may I say the ambition in the management team, to pursue global projects.'' 
 The combined company would have 110,000 employees, operate in 17 countries on five continents and produce 11 million tons of alumina, the basic ingredient of aluminum, each year. 
 Kirill S. Chuiko, a metals and mining analyst at UralSib brokerage, said that he expected the Russian government to buy a stake in the combined company within a year or two. Even now, he said, the Kremlin probably had a strong say Rusal's strategic business plan, as is the case in many large Russian companies, both state-owned and nominally private. 
 ''Nobody can argue that at one level or another,'' Mr. Chuiko said, ''the government isn't influencing this company.''

HEADLINE: Voluntary Lettuce Recall Creates More Worry for Farmers

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY; Carolyn Marshall contributed reporting from San Francisco, and Libby Sander from Chicago.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
It is, in scope and severity, a fairly minor recall: about 8,500 cartons of lettuce, which may or may not have come into contact with irrigation water contaminated with E. coli bacteria. No one has gotten sick, the lettuce company involved emphasized, adding that the move was precautionary. 
 But for farmers in the Salinas Valley of California, already reeling from last month's deadly E. coli outbreak in spinach, the timing could not have been worse. 
 ''It clearly has the potential to set back our effort to regain consumer confidence,'' said Bob Perkins, the executive director of the farm bureau in Monterey County, one of three counties to which the contaminated spinach was linked. ''Right now, I don't know how the story is playing out with the general public, whether it's an example of another problem with the industry or it's an example of how the system works.'' 
 The voluntary recall of the lettuce, announced Sunday by the Nunes Company, based in Salinas, involved about 8,500 cartons of green leaf lettuce sold under the Foxy label. Tom Nunes Jr., the company's president, said Monday that only 250 cartons could have reached consumers and that those were believed to be in one of seven Western states: Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon or Washington. Mr. Nunes said the other cartons had been found and were being destroyed.
 The recall was decided on, Mr. Nunes said, after a test of reservoir water at a single Salinas Valley farm that supplies the Nunes Company found ''a dangerous concentration of generic E. coli.'' But he said there was no evidence yet that it was the potentially lethal strain E. coli O157:H7, which contaminated spinach last month, causing three deaths and sickening nearly 200. 
 ''We don't know what kind of E. coli it is,'' said Mr. Nunes, who added that further test results on the E. coli were expected back Tuesday. ''But it was enough to get our attention.''
 Federal health authorities commended the recall and said Monday that no illnesses had been linked to the Nunes Company's products or to the irrigation water. Finding very low levels of E. coli in water is not unusual, said Dr. David Acheson, chief medical officer of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration. 
 Whether that will reassure customers or result in lettuce wilting at the salad bar remains to be seen. In downtown San Francisco, some delis posted signs informing customers that the shops were not using Foxy lettuce alongside notices that their spinach was safe. 
 Tina Lopez, an office worker at Washington Mutual here, said she was not worried about the salad she had just bought for lunch. ''I figured if they had it out, it was probably O.K.,'' Ms. Lopez said. ''If anything it's probably safer because they're scrutinizing everything.'' 
 That was exactly the kind of reaction farmers' groups were hoping for. Tim Chelling, a spokesman for Western Growers, which represents 3,000 farmers and shippers in California and Arizona, said the response to the lettuce recall had been more forceful than the one to the spinach. 
 ''I've been hearing from everybody and their brother,'' Mr. Chelling said. ''Everybody is communicating, trading information. People aren't stumbling around in the fields in shock, but very quickly trying to organize themselves as professionally and diligently as possible.'' 
 The lettuce recall is the latest in a series of food scares, including a recent recall of carrot juice linked to an outbreak of botulism in Georgia and Florida, and an Iowa company's recall of 5,200 pounds of ground beef thought to have been contaminated with E. coli. 
 And though the nationwide spinach warning has been lifted, the investigation continues. Last week, officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Criminal Investigations at the F.D.A. searched two processing facilities in the Salinas Valley. 
 Even more than spinach, however, contaminated lettuce has long been a source of concern for health authorities. In August, the F.D.A. announced the Lettuce Safety Initiative, meant to address E. coli outbreaks in the past decade that had been linked to fields in the Salinas Valley, about 100 miles south of San Francisco.
 Still, Dr. Acheson said that Americans safely consumed hundreds of thousands of pounds of leafy greens every year and that the recent outbreak tied to spinach was an agricultural anomaly. 
 ''Every now and again something goes wrong,'' he said, ''and the spinach example was one of the worst. Are we ever going to reach a point where we can say there is zero risk associated with fresh leafy greens? Probably not.''
 But food safety experts said the lettuce recall only affirmed the need for more governmental oversight of the fresh produce industry, and for the type of inspections that governed meat and poultry.
 ''There's no federal agency that deals with this,'' said Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, public health and food safety at New York University. ''This falls through the cracks, and that needs to be fixed.''
 That need is even more acute, Dr. Nestle said, because many vegetables are eaten raw. ''You could cook spinach, but you don't ever cook lettuce,'' she said. 
 Dave Kranz, a spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation, said it was premature to estimate what kind of economic damage the lettuce recall might inflict on farmers already hit hard by the spinach scare. Although the government warning on that crop was lifted, Mr. Kranz said, many farmers are still on hold, ''waiting to see how much demand there will be, and how soon.''
 While the Salinas Valley has been the focus of the recent E. Coli investigations, the growing season is poised to shift south, and there, farmers are anxious. 
 ''It's a huge worry,'' said Jack Vessey, a vegetable farmer in El Centro, about 500 miles south of Salinas. Mr. Vessey grows 20 winter crops at his 7,000-acre ranch and just seeded green leaf lettuce fields for the mid-November harvest. Now, however, he is having second thoughts. 
 ''The consumer confidence has to come back,'' Mr. Vessey said. ''I'm putting seed in the ground. But I'm pretty much gambling on what I plant now.''

HEADLINE: School Financing Case Plays Out in Court, and in Classrooms

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
Jeremy Ayala has grown up in public schools in the South Bronx, all the way to his fifth year at John F. Kennedy High School, where he is still struggling to earn a diploma. For all that time, more than 13 years, a lawsuit accusing New York State of shortchanging New York City's schools by billions of dollars has wended its way slowly through the courts.
 Jeremy has managed to hold on, through mediocre elementary schools and an intermediate school where only 6.9 percent of its current students read at grade level, persevering even as many classmates dropped out. He now attends class at night so he can work during the day, clinging to the hope of graduation.
 Today, the legal fight enters its final stage, as lawyers for the schoolchildren and for the state face off in New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals. But as the case winds down, the experiences of students like Jeremy and the schools they attended illustrate the heavy human cost as the court case has been fought, long enough for baby-faced kindergartners to become old enough to vote. 
 Since the lawsuit began in 1993, at least 224,000 public students have dropped out, according to city records. And while test scores showed 48.6 percent of city students reading at grade level when the case began, this year's scores show that number little changed, at 50.7 percent. 
 ''When you look at the cumulative deprivation of resources over time, it's not surprising that you end up with dropout rates of 40 percent or higher,'' said Joseph F. Wayland, the lead lawyer for the plaintiff, a coalition called the Campaign for Fiscal Equity. ''What does that tell you about what happened to kids 13 years along the way?''
 Lower courts have blamed the state for these failures, saying its financing system denied city students the opportunity to get a sound, basic education. And they have ordered the state to provide at least $4.7 billion more a year for the schools. At arguments today, the plaintiffs will ask the court to force Albany to pay up, while the state will seek to reduce the judgment to $1.93 billion.
 Critics of the lawsuit have long argued that many complex problems, like mismanagement, rather than a lack of money are at the root of the school system's failings. ''We have no reason to believe that just putting in more money is going to lead to any change,'' said Eric A. Hanushek, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the editor of a new book, ''Courting Failure: How School Financing Lawsuits Exploit Judges' Good Intentions and Harm Our Children.'' 
 Geri D. Palast, the director of the fiscal equity group, said it had asked the court to impose strict controls to make sure the money was spent wisely. ''Accountability is at the core of this,'' she said.
 An end to the dispute may be in sight. While Gov. George E. Pataki has fought the lawsuit relentlessly, the state this year partly complied with the lower court rulings by authorizing more than $11.2 billion in school construction for the city. And Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who has been the state's top lawyer in the case for eight years, has promised a quick resolution if he is elected governor. He leads widely in polls. 
 Deputy Mayor Dennis M. Walcott, who oversees education issues at City Hall, said the additional billions in aid were ''extremely crucial'' to carrying out Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's education agenda, including prekindergarten for all 3- and 4-year-olds and reduced class sizes for all students. 
 Mr. Walcott, who was on the old city Board of Education when the lawsuit was filed, said the inequity in financing had caused incalculable damage. ''There are a number of children who have fallen by the wayside, who have been lost as a result,'' he said. ''It's a price tag to the lives of children. That's a price tag you can't cost out at all.'' 
 Jeremy Ayala had just turned 5 when the Campaign for Fiscal Equity filed suit in the spring of 1993. 
 Although he was born in New York and his native language is English, Jeremy was lumped with other Latino children in an English as a Second Language class when he reached second grade. 
 ''I could speak fluent English; as a matter of fact my second language is Spanish,'' he said during an interview in the Kennedy High School library. ''Because of my last name, I was put in E.S.L, which made me take easier classes.'' 
 What he needed but never received, he said, was extra help in math. ''I was never a math person,'' he said. 
 And while Jeremy said he never felt that his schools lacked supplies, he recalled that textbooks were often outdated in the late 1990's. The clue could be found in graffiti tags scrawled by previous students inside the front covers. ''It was like 'Holler, 1982,' '' he said. 
 After attending Public School 25 on East 149th Street in the Bronx and a second elementary school, P.S. 161 on Tinton Avenue, Jeremy headed to Intermediate School 184 on Forest Avenue, long a failing school that will close after this year. The building will house three small schools. 
 The school's principal, Alejandro M. Soto, arrived in September 2003, three months after Jeremy left. 
 ''This building, to start with, had not been painted in 20 plus years,'' he said. Many classrooms were in disrepair, including huge, ghastly rooms for metal and woodworking shops and home economics classes. ''They had been abandoned for a long time,'' Mr. Soto said. 
 The floors in the gym and a dance room were ruined. ''The library was totally, totally destroyed,'' he said. ''The books were from the 60's and 50's and 40's, whatever was left.''
 ''And that was just the infrastructure, never mind the kids,'' he continued. ''It was like being on another planet, no education, no reading, no writing, no math.'' 
 Slowly, the building has been restored. The old shops are now classrooms with teacher offices tucked behind partitions. The library has been repaired and restocked. Walls have been painted; the gym and dance floors refinished.
 But signs of neglect remain. In the huge playground, only one of four dented backboards hanging along the fence has a rim. 
 With the support of the regional superintendent, Peter Heaney, Mr. Soto said he believed he could turn around the school if he had more time and more money. But he has neither. 
 His first step, he said, would be to seize on the students' love of technology. ''The first thing I would do is revamp the entire multimedia lab,'' he said. ''I would put in state-of-the-art, just like the rich people's schools in New Jersey, computers, LCD projectors, where kids could come in and do their presentations, where we could talk to classrooms around the world.'' 
 Kendra Brown, the school's art teacher, said she would add an extra adult to each classroom, making it more like Saint Ann's, the Brooklyn private school, where a friend teaches. ''They have two teachers for 20 kids; there's a teacher and an associate,'' Ms. Brown said. ''One teacher to every 10 kids fixes so many problems.'' 
 In 2002, only 22 of 238 eighth graders in Jeremy's class at the school, just 9.3 percent, scored at grade level on the state English test. One quarter scored at the lowest level, indicating that they were mostly illiterate.
 Ms. Brown said that many of her adolescent students were too immature to understand their situation fully, but that occasionally reality set in. ''One boy actually started to cry,'' she said last week, ''because he realized how far behind he was and started worrying about his future.'' 
 When Jeremy arrived at Kennedy, on Terrace View Avenue, he said educators once again assumed that his Spanish was better than his English. He was assigned to an advanced placement Spanish course, and asked to write an autobiography. ''I said, 'Listen to me, you are speaking to me in Spanish, and I don't know what you are saying,'' Jeremy said. ''I don't know how to write the accent marks.'' 
 Four years later, Jeremy, now 18, is still hoping to graduate. But many of Kennedy's 3,000 students do not. Only 44.5 percent graduate in four years, and just 63 percent graduate before aging out of the school system at 21, according to the most recent statistics. 
 City officials say they have made the most progress in elementary grades. But at P.S. 25, where Jeremy began school, only 28.1 percent of students today read at grade level. At P.S. 161, which he also attended, the figure is only 38.9 percent.
 Mr. Wayland, the lead lawyer for the coalition, said he would argue to the judges today that they, like Jeremy, and the city school system, have unfinished business. ''We don't want the court to stop,'' Mr. Wayland said. ''We're at the very end, and it would be a shame to watch us go backwards if the court won't take the final step.''

HEADLINE: Poll Shows Foley Case Is Alienating Public From Congress

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEYand JANET ELDER; Marjorie Connelly, Marina Stefan and Megan C. Thee contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Americans say that Republican Congressional leaders put their political interests ahead of protecting the safety of teenage pages, and that House leaders knew of Mark Foley's sexually charged messages to pages well before he was forced to quit Congress, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
 The poll, completed before North Korea announced that it had detonated its first nuclear test, also found that the war in Iraq was continuing to take a toll on President Bush and the Republican Party, and that the White House was having difficulty retaining its edge in handling terrorism.
The number of Americans who approve of Mr. Bush's handling of the campaign against terrorism dropped to 46 percent from 54 percent in the past two weeks, suggesting that he failed to gain any political lift from an orchestrated set of ceremonies marking the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. In addition, the poll shows that Americans are now evenly divided over which party they think can better handle terrorism, the first time in the Bush presidency that Democrats have matched Republicans on national security, despite a concerted White House effort to seize the advantage on the issue this month. 
 With four weeks left before Election Day, the poll indicates that the scandal involving Mr. Foley, a former Republican congressman from Florida, is alienating Americans from Congress, and weakening a Republican Party that was already struggling to keep control of the House and Senate. By overwhelming numbers, including majorities of Republicans, Americans said that most members of Congress did not follow the same rules of behavior as average Americans, and that most members of Congress considered themselves above the law. 
 ''Politics goes to people's heads and they see themselves as their own little entity,'' said Donna Mummert, 68, a Republican from Marsing, Idaho, in a follow-up interview after participating in the poll. ''They forget why they're there to represent us.''
 Seventy-nine percent of respondents said House Republican leaders were more concerned about their political standing than about the safety of teenage Congressional pages. About half of respondents said that the House Republican leadership had improperly handled the Foley case, compared with 27 percent who said they approved of how it was handled; 46 percent of respondents said Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois should step down. And Americans are more likely to say that Democrats, and not Republicans, share their moral values.
 The nationwide telephone poll was conducted Thursday through Sunday with 983 adults, including 891 registered voters. The margin of sampling error for the entire sample is plus or minus three percentage points and is the same for the registered voters.
 The poll describes what is by any measure a difficult political environment for the White House and Republican Congressional leaders. Still, it is a measure of national sentiment rather than the likely outcome in the approximately 40 House races and 8 Senate races that will determine which party controls Congress next January. 
 In many of the races where Republicans are in danger of losing seats, Democrats hold relatively slight leads, according to local polls and internal party polls. Republicans are counting on their strong voter turnout operation, and sizable financial advantage over Democrats, to compensate for the difficulties they face. 
 There has been no change since mid-September in the gap between Americans who said they planned to vote for a Democrat over a Republican in their district this November: 49 percent to 35 percent. But Democratic voters are more likely than Republicans to say they are enthusiastic about voting this November.
 The public's view of Iraq is as dark as it has been since the war began in 2003, with two-thirds saying it is going somewhat or very badly, while only 3 percent are saying the war is going very well. Two-thirds said they disapproved of how Mr. Bush was handling Iraq.
 Mr. Bush's job approval rating has slipped to 34 percent, from 37 percent in September. That is one of the lowest levels of his presidency and poses a complication for the White House as it seeks to send him out on the road to rally base voters. Mr. Bush's job approval rating has even slipped with his base: 75 percent of conservative Republicans approve of the way he has handled his job, compared with 96 percent in November 2004.
 The president clearly faces constraints as he seeks to address the public concerns about Iraq that have shrouded this midterm election: 83 percent of respondents thought that Mr. Bush was either hiding something or mostly lying when he discussed how the war in Iraq was going. Fifty-seven percent of respondents said Mr. Bush was personally aware of intelligence reports before Sept. 11 that warned of possible domestic terrorist attacks using airplanes. When the same question was asked in May 2002, 41 percent said they believed Mr. Bush was aware.
 ''Iraq was a mistake, and even though he gets up and says it's going O.K., it hasn't been going O.K. since Day One,'' said Gertrude Knowles, a self-described independent voter from Quincy, Mass. ''Now he's got to make it sound better than it is.''
 So far, at least, it appears that, at least nationally, Republicans have had little success in pressing what have been their two biggest lines of attacks against Democratic challengers this fall: taxes and terrorism. The poll found that 41 percent of respondents thought Republicans were stronger on handling terrorism, compared with 40 percent who named Democrats, a statistically insignificant difference. Before Labor Day, Republicans had a 42 percent to 34 percent edge on handling terrorism.
 And in a month in which Republicans have sought to discredit Democratic challengers as advocates of big spending and high taxes, 52 percent of respondents said that Democrats would make the right decisions on how to spend taxpayers' money, while 29 percent said Republicans would. 
 Americans said that Democrats would do a better job than Republicans in making decisions on the war, on the economy and on taxes. Democrats are viewed more positively, or less negatively, than Republicans, with 39 percent saying they held a favorable view of Republicans, compared with 54 percent who said they held an unfavorable view. By contrast, 52 percent of respondents had a favorable view of the Democratic Party, compared with 40 percent who had an unfavorable view.
 The problems for Congress have clearly been exacerbated by the Foley scandal. Eighty percent of Americans said they considered the Foley revelations either very serious or somewhat serious. Two-thirds said that House Republicans did not initially take the warnings seriously enough, and 62 percent said they believed House Republican leaders knew before last week that Mr. Foley had sent sexually explicit messages to teenagers.
 ''They just covered it up,'' said Charles Young, a Republican from upstate New York. ''We put them in office to do what is right for the country. It should have been brought to their attention and disposed of. We don't need people in office who corrupt our children.''
 The poll found that 69 percent of Americans thought that members of Congress considered themselves above the law, and 69 percent thought that members of Congress did not live by the same rules of behavior that they did. 
 The poll found that 47 percent of respondents believed that Democrats came closer to sharing their moral values, compared with 38 percent who said Republicans did. The Democratic standing in this areaincluded some unlikely groups: 26 percent of conservatives and 43 percent of people who live in the South named Democrats as the party that came closer to sharing their values.

How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Oct. 5 through Oct. 8 with 983 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 891 said they were registered to vote. 
 The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to ensure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population.
 Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey. 
 The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, marital status, age and education. 
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults. For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. Shifts in results between polls over time also have a larger sampling error. 
 In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: BUSH REBUKES NORTH KOREA; U.S. SEEKS NEW U.N. SANCTIONS 

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Warren Hoge reported from the United Nations, and Sheryl Gay Stolberg from Washington.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
The United States proposed tough new United Nations sanctions on North Korea on Monday after its reported test of a nuclear device, and President Bush warned the North that he considered its activity a potential threat to American national security.
 At an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, the United States pressed for international inspections of all cargo moving into and out of North Korea to detect weapons-related material, and a ban on all trading in military goods and services with the country.
 At the White House, President Bush called the North Korean test ''a threat to international peace and security'' and condemned it as a ''provocative act.''
 But Russia and China, which have veto power and have consistently opposed tough sanctions, did not signal that they were ready to go along with the American proposal. Britain, France and Japan said they were also pressing for strong sanctions, which the Council is expected to debate in the coming days. 
 Coming just a month before the November elections, North Korea's reported test on Monday morning had immediate political ramifications. Democrats were already using their campaigns to argue that the Iraq war had made the United States less secure by diverting attention away from threats like North Korea; now they are using the North's claim to hammer away at their theme.
 Mr. Bush also issued a pointed, albeit carefully worded, warning to the North not to export any nuclear technology it might have. In the past, North Korea has sold its weapons systems to other countries. 
 ''The transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or nonstate entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And we would hold North Korea fully accountable of the consequences of such action.''
 The president has not used the phrase ''grave threat'' in the past with respect to North Korea, and analysts interpreted the remark as a signal that the White House was, in effect, stating new boundaries for what it would accept from the North, given that diplomacy has not worked.
 ''He has finally drawn a very clear red line, which is essentially: we know you have nukes, don't even think about proliferating,'' said Mike Chinoy, an expert on Korean security at the Pacific Council on International Policy, a research institution in Los Angeles.
 ''It's kind of always been the unspoken administration red line,'' Mr. Chinoy said, ''because the reality is that, whatever the harshness of their rhetoric, the Bush administration has not been able to actually stop North Korea from staging this nuclear breakout.''
 Democratic Party strategists quickly circulated a ''talking points'' memorandum to Democratic candidates, urging them to cast the reported North Korean nuclear test as ''a colossal foreign policy failure of the Bush administration.'' Several picked up on that theme.
 Claire McCaskill, a Democratic candidate for the Senate from Missouri, convened a previously scheduled conference call with Richard Ben-Veniste, a member of the commission that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks, and used it to raise the issue of North Korea. Representative Harold E. Ford Jr., the Democratic Senate candidate in Tennessee, issued a statement to reporters, as did Senator Robert Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat in a tough re-election fight.
 ''Today's nuclear test by North Korea confirms our worst fears and illustrates just how much the Bush administration's incompetence has endangered our nation,'' Mr. Menendez said in the statement, adding, ''While George Bush bogged our military down to topple a regime that had no weapons of mass destruction, a brutal dictator in North Korea has strengthened a nuclear arsenal that has the potential to threaten the West Coast of the United States.''
 Republicans were more muted in their reactions; Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican whip, issued a brief statement calling North Korea's claim a ''confrontational move designed only to destabilize the region.'' 
 White House officials insisted that despite the talk of sanctions at the United Nations, the administration's goal remains persuading North Korea to return to the six-nation talks and give up its nuclear program. Those negotiations have dragged on for more than two years with no substantive results, and North Korea left them 13 months ago. 
 Mr. Bush spent more than an hour on the telephone Monday morning in separate calls to leaders of the four nations, aside from the United States and North Korea, that are participating in those talks: Japan, China, South Korea and Russia.
 Asserting Washington's determination to protect Japan and South Korea, its principal allies in the region, Mr. Bush said the United States ''will meet the full range of our deterrent and security commitments.''
 He was careful to say that intelligence officials were still working to confirm North Korea's statement about its test. But he said that ''such a claim itself constitutes a threat to international peace and security.''
 China, North Korea's closest supporter and neighbor, called the action a ''flagrant'' violation of international opinion and said it ''firmly opposes'' North Korea's conduct. Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, said his country ''absolutely condemns'' the test.
 John R. Bolton, the American ambassador to the United Nations, reported that the 15 members of the Security Council were ''solid'' in deploring the North Korean move, and he said he hoped for swift action. But by Monday evening the Council adjourned its deliberations and set further meetings for Tuesday while, Mr. Bolton said, they received instructions from their capitals.
 Richard A. Grenell, Mr. Bolton's spokesman, said that the United States was merging its suggestions with those from Japan and that a draft resolution was being composed on that basis.
 In its 13-point proposal, the United States urged the Security Council to require North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program, suspend its building of ballistic missiles, freeze assets and transactions associated with the development of unconventional weapons, impose a ban on trade in luxury goods and prevent abuse of the international financial system, a reference to North Korean counterfeiting activities.
 According to a draft amendment, the Japanese want to place additional restrictions on North Korean ships, aircraft and products, and prevent North Korean officials from being able to move outside the country's borders.
 Japan is also suggesting that the secretary general ''actively engage in this matter.'' 
 Earlier Monday, the Security Council formally nominated Ban Ki-moon, the foreign minister of South Korea, as the new secretary general, succeeding Kofi Annan when he retires Dec. 31. Mr. Ban had said in a Seoul news conference that he intended to make peace on the Korean Peninsula a high priority.
 Mr. Bolton said the new resolution ought to be drawn up under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, which makes sanctions mandatory and militarily enforceable.
 It is a procedure that China and Russia, both permanent members, traditionally resist. It was eliminated from the resolution passed in July condemning North Korean missile launchings.
 While Wang Guangya, the Chinese ambassador, said Beijing condemned the North Korean action, which it had warned North Korea against taking, he turned aside questions on whether China would now support a sanctions resolution.
 He said only that the Council should ''react firmly, constructively and prudently,'' adding that ''the door to solve this issue from a diplomatic point of view is still open.''
 Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador, also declined to state whether Moscow's view on sanctions had changed. ''I think the North Koreans will be facing a very serious attitude on the part of the Security Council,'' he said, without elaborating.
 Moscow and Beijing would be particularly affected by the American call for border inspections of shipments in and out of North Korea because the borders involved are theirs.

HEADLINE: Talking With the Monsters

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
If there's one overriding lesson from North Korea's apparent nuclear test, it's this: We need to negotiate directly even with hostile and brutal regimes.
 It's probably too late to clean up the mess that President Bush has made on the Korean peninsula, but there is time to apply the lesson to Syria and especially Iran -- where we may soon be facing a third military conflict in a Muslim country.
As former Secretary of State James Baker noted in an ABC News interview on Sunday: ''I believe in talking to your enemies. It's not appeasement to talk to your enemies.'' 
 The administrations of both the first President Bush and of President Clinton talked to North Korea. That engagement sometimes seemed distasteful, but it averted war and created incentives for North Korea to moderate its behavior -- just a bit.
 The bottom line is reflected in the plutonium obtained by North Korea. Here's the scorecard: Amount obtained during the Clinton administration, zero; amount obtained under this administration, enough for about eight nuclear weapons. (North Korea has also tried since late in the Clinton administration to enrich uranium for a separate path to nuclear weapons, but apparently still hasn't succeeded and perhaps never will.)
 ''By not having any contact, we've lost any way of controlling or directing the outcome,'' noted James Laney, a longtime Korea specialist and former ambassador to South Korea. ''As this test indicates, we're completely out of the picture.''
 The real culprit, of course, is not President Bush but Kim Jong-il, North Korea's ''Dear Leader.'' That said, if Colin Powell and other administration moderates had been allowed to engage North Korea as they had wanted, we would not now be caught in this nuclear crisis.
 Administration hard-liners believe that North Korea's regime may collapse at any moment. Maybe. But when I visited last year, the regime seemed as solid (and repressive) as when I first visited in 1989. Sure, it will collapse at some point, but waiting for disintegration is not a strategy.
 Indeed, North Korea may be less vulnerable now, partly because its economy has improved significantly since the late 1990's as a result of increasing trade with China. Last year, North Korea's trade with China was double the level of 2002 and quadruple that of 1999.
 The China-North Korea border crossing at Sanhe has just expanded its operations, and trade could rise sharply if the two countries follow through on discussions to expand rail links and export Chinese containers from the North Korean port of Rajin.
 Mr. Bush's push for tough U.N. resolutions is welcome but is no substitute for direct talks. The reality is that even if China and South Korea were willing to apply tough economic sanctions to the North -- which they are not -- the Dear Leader would stick to his guns. After all, this is a man who imported Mercedes-Benzes in the late 1990's while two million of his compatriots were dying in a famine. 
 So our huffing and puffing won't cause North Korea to back down, but we could drift toward greater dangers: If we move to enforce naval inspections of ships coming in and out of North Korea, the Dear Leader will threaten war. I doubt if he means it -- but I still wouldn't buy real estate in Tokyo, Okinawa or Seoul right now.
 So what should we do?
 While proceeding with U.N. resolutions, we should also talk to North Korea directly. It's probably too late to persuade it to give up its nuclear arsenal, but it's plausible that it would freeze plutonium production and suspend missile and nuclear tests. Those are feasible goals that China might use its leverage to help achieve.
 To show that talking with enemies doesn't mean rolling over, we can also insist on raising human rights issues. American conservatives have led the way in protesting brutality in North Korea, but the protests simply aren't effective. The U.S. government could add to the pressure by going public with satellite images of concentration camps and publicizing other intelligence about North Korean human rights abuses.
 The challenge is larger than North Korea, though -- it concerns how to stand up to all of the world's rogue regimes. Notably, in the two where Mr. Bush has tried engagement he has enjoyed bits of success. Those are Sudan and Libya.
 Even though Mr. Bush says that Sudan is engaging in genocide in Darfur, we continue (quite properly) to negotiate with Khartoum -- and that helped end the war between north and south Sudan, after two million deaths. Likewise, negotiations with Libya led it to give up its W.M.D. programs. 
 In contrast, we eschewed most direct diplomacy with North Korea and Iraq, and the result has been disastrous. So as we lurch ahead toward a showdown with Iran, let's remember the historical evidence: We sometimes do better talking to monsters than trying to slay them or wish them away.

HEADLINE: Japan Now Seems Likely to Rally Behind New Prime Minister's Call for a Stronger Military

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
The last time North Korea tested a powerful new weapon, in 1998 when it fired a ballistic missile over the largest Japanese island, Japan reacted by upgrading its military and swinging politically to the right.
 North Korea's claim that it tested a nuclear weapon on Monday appears likely to push Japan even further down the same nationalist path. Many political analysts say the test, which has yet to be confirmed, could weaken public support for the pacifism Japan adopted after World War II and prompt it to seek a growing regional security role.
But could the crisis be big enough to force Japan to break what might be its ultimate postwar taboo and go nuclear itself? 
 This is what some in East Asia have speculated it would do if the isolated and erratic Communist government to its north suddenly conducted an atomic bomb test. But for now, analysts say, domestic opposition runs too deep for Japan to reverse its renunciation of nuclear weapons.
 ''The nuclear test may prove to be an even bigger shock to public opinion'' than the 1998 missile, said Yasunori Sone, a professor of political and policy analysis at Keio University in Tokyo. ''It will get a minority of people here calling for Japan to build nuclear weapons.''
 The most likely result of North Korea's actions, analysts say, would be to rally public opinion around Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and his calls for taking Japan in a more assertive direction. The crisis may also increase Mr. Abe's chances of revising the Constitution to allow Japan to possess full-fledged armed forces.
 There have been no calls yet here to build atomic weapons. Still, that is not a far-fetched notion. Japan is known to have stockpiles of weapons-grade atomic material, used in its civilian nuclear power and research programs, and some studies have said it would be able to construct a bomb in a matter of months. 
 But Mr. Sone and other analysts say that despite North Korea's claim of a weapons test, Japanese proponents of acquiring nuclear weapons will remain a minority on the far-right fringe. Analysts say going nuclear would face broad and emotional opposition in Japan, which remains the only nation to have suffered atomic bomb attacks. 
 The prospect of a nuclear Japan might also send shudders through the rest of Asia, where memories of Japan's wartime aggression are still raw. Some fear it could even set off a new Asian arms race. 
 Mr. Abe appeared to be trying to take a leading role in responding to the crisis, analysts here said. He and other Japanese leaders were quick to condemn the reported test, saying Japan was working with the United States, its closest ally, and Asian neighbors like South Korea and China to find a response.
 Speaking in Seoul, where he was meeting with President Roh Moo-hyun, Mr. Abe criticized the test as a ''serious threat to the security of Japan and South Korea, and of neighboring countries.''
 ''We have agreed that we must respond resolutely,'' Mr. Abe said in a news conference after the meeting. ''We have entered a new and more dangerous era.''
 He also said Japan was considering imposing economic sanctions against North Korea and increasing its participation in a missile defense shield that it is developing with the United States. He said Japan had requested an immediate meeting of the United Nations Security Council.
 In Tokyo, Yasuhisa Shiozaki, the chief cabinet secretary and top government spokesman, said Japan would try to work with the United States to seek United Nations action, possibly including global economic sanctions. ''We will lodge a stern protest and condemn'' the test, he said.
 If North Korea has exploded a nuclear device, analysts said the effects on Japanese public opinion might take time to appear. When North Korea test-fired a multistage Taepodong missile over Japan in 1998, Japan's initial reaction was muted, but public opinion ended up moving sharply in favor of building a stronger defense.
 That allowed Japan to begin adding weapons that once would have been unthinkable, including Japan's first spy satellite, a troop transport ship now under construction that experts say could serve as a small aircraft carrier, and aerial tankers that would allow Japanese fighter jets to refuel in midair to reach North Korea and other countries.
 For now, analysts said most of Japan's action was likely to come on the diplomatic front. They also said the crisis offered an unexpected chance for Japan to patch up its ties with South Korea and China.
 ''This crisis allows Mr. Abe to say that all three countries face a shared enemy,'' Mr. Sone of Keio University said. ''This is a chance for him to improve relations with Asia.''

HEADLINE: Dot-Com Boom Echoed in Deal To Buy YouTube

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN; Jeff Leeds contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A profitless Web site started by three 20-somethings after a late-night dinner party is sold for more than a billion dollars, instantly turning dozens of its employees into paper millionaires. It sounds like a tale from the late 1990's dot-com bubble, but it happened yesterday.
 Google, the online search behemoth, agreed yesterday to pay $1.65 billion in stock for the Web site that came out of that party -- YouTube, the video-sharing phenomenon that is the darling of an Internet resurgence known as Web 2.0.
 YouTube had been coveted by virtually every big media and technology company, as they seek to tap into a generation of consumers who are viewing 100 million short videos on the site every day. Google is expected to try to make money from YouTube by integrating the site with its search technology and search-based advertising program. [Page C1.] 
 But the purchase price has also invited comparisons to the mind-boggling valuations that were once given to dozens of Silicon Valley companies a decade ago. Like YouTube, those companies were once the Next Big Thing, but some soon folded. 
 Google, with a market value of $132 billion, can clearly afford to take a gamble with YouTube, but the question remains: How to put a price tag on an unproven business? 
 ''If you believe it's the future of television, it's clearly worth $1.6 billion,'' Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, said of YouTube. ''If you believe something else, you could write down maybe it's not worth much at all.''
 In a conference call to announce the transaction yesterday, there were eerie echoes of the late 1990's boom time. There was no mention of what measures Google used to arrive at the price it agreed to pay. At one point, Google's vice president, David Drummond, gave a cryptic explanation: ''We modeled this on a more or less synergistic kind of model. You can imagine this would be hard to do on a stand-alone basis.'' 
 The price tag Google paid may simply have been the cost of beating its rivals -- Yahoo, Viacom and the News Corporation -- to take control of the most sought-after Web site of the moment. It was also perhaps the only price that two YouTube founders, Chad Hurley, 29, and Steven Chen, 28, and their big venture capital backer, Sequoia Capital Partners, were willing to accept, given that they most likely could have continued as an independent company. A third YouTube founder, Jawed Karim, left the company to pursue an advanced degree at Stanford. 
 The deal came together in a matter of days. After rebuffing a series of other overtures, YouTube's founders decided to have lunch on Wednesday with Google's co-founder, Larry Page, and its chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt. The idea of a deal had been broached a few days earlier. The setting was classic Silicon Valley start-up: a booth at Denny's near YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, Calif. The Google executives threw out an offer of $1.6 billion and autonomy to continue running the business.
 That set off a marathon of meetings and conference calls over the next two days, which kicked into even higher gear on Friday, when news of the talks began to circulate, putting pressure on Google to sign a deal before a rival bid emerged. In fact, the News Corporation sent a letter to YouTube seeking to start talks but never received a response.
 ''The Google-YouTube deal has to feel a little like the 1990's, but it isn't,'' said Dmitry Shapiro, chief executive of Veoh, a YouTube competitor that is backed by Time Warner and Michael D. Eisner, the former chairman of Disney. Arguing that online video represents an entirely new medium, he said, ''If you knew then what you know now and you had the chance to acquire Amazon or eBay -- which weren't making any money either -- you would have bought them.''
 Of course, YouTube has also been compared to Napster, whose music-sharing service was eventually shuttered after a series of lawsuits. While YouTube has made some deals with content providers, including one yesterday with CBS, its users have uploaded millions of copyrighted clips, leading some to question whether Google is inheriting a legal minefield. YouTube has said it is different from the old Napster service because it removes content when a copyright holder complains.
 ''There are some issues with YouTube,'' Sumner M. Redstone, chairman of Viacom, said last week on ''The Charlie Rose Show.'' ''They use other people's products,'' he said, alluding to pirated video. ''The only way they avoid litigation now is they stop doing it if you call them.''
 Mark Cuban, who founded Broadcast.com, an early audio and video site that was bought by Yahoo, is even more skeptical of Google's legal position, writing on his blog: ''I still think Google lawyers will be a busy, busy bunch. I don't think you can sue Google into oblivion, but as others have mentioned, if Google gets nailed one single time for copyright violation, there are going to be more shareholder lawsuits than Doan's has pills to go with the pile-on copyright suits that follow.''
 Yet the deal with Google was announced hours after YouTube disclosed deals with entertainment companies that appeared to reduce the risk that it would become mired in copyright disputes. 
 YouTube is Google's first big acquisition after making a series of much smaller deals for companies, including Pyra Labs, creator of Blogger. Google now joins the Internet's establishment -- Yahoo, eBay and Amazon.com, among others -- which have all made giant acquisitions to expand their businesses beyond their traditional trade. 
 But those companies have had mixed results. Yahoo paid $3.6 billion in 1999 for Geocities, a company that allowed users to create their own Web sites; today, MySpace, a social networking site bought by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation last year for only $580 million, far eclipses it. EBay, on the other hand, acquired PayPal, a rapidly growing start-up that lets people make payments via e-mail, for $1.5 billion in 2002. It now represents more than a third of eBay's revenue.
 Rather than pursuing big acquisitions, Google has been known for plowing money into research and development, spending $483.98 million last year, an increase of more than 114 percent over the previous year.
 The success of the YouTube acquisition will probably lie in embedding video advertising into the clips that millions of people watch everyday from their computers. So far, YouTube's management has been reluctant to include advertising within clips, for fear of alienating users. 
 Yesterday, however, Mr. Hurley, one of YouTube's founders, appeared more open to experimenting, saying that he was even considering testing what's known as a pre-roll -- a 15-second ad before a clip -- something he had long derided as potentially ruining the user experience.
 While more marketers have been eager to advertise against online video, some big consumer companies have been reluctant to fully embrace advertising against user-generated content because it is difficult to differentiate good content from offensive material. YouTube has created an assortment of tools for users and content creators to police its site.
 YouTube said it had struck accords to license content from two of the four major music conglomerates -- the Universal Music Group and Sony BMG Music Entertainment -- and the CBS television network in exchange for a percentage of YouTube's advertising revenue. 
 YouTube is also expected to use new technology to identify copyrighted material that users have uploaded to the site without permission, and to share ad revenue with media companies that own the video or music content. (YouTube made a similar pact with the Warner Music Group last month, and had a previous advertising deal with NBC in June). 
 The deals reflect how media companies are rethinking the distribution of their entertainment content online. 
 The deal with Universal, the world's biggest music corporation, drew particular attention because the company had said it was contemplating a lawsuit against YouTube over copyright issues.
 Phil Leigh, the president of Inside Digital Media, said the new arrangements represented ''a strong endorsement that the major media companies are going to see YouTube as a legitimate business partner.''
 Mr. Leigh said that also suggested a rethinking of the approach the companies took to Napster. ''It shows that very important, erstwhile reluctant media companies have got religion,'' he said.
 The YouTube alliances also came the same day that Google announced separate deals to license music videos from Sony BMG and Warner. 
 Under the terms of the deal, YouTube, which has about 60 employees, will retain much of its identity and will keep its name and its office in San Bruno, more than 25 miles from Google's headquarters in Mountain View.
 The transaction was announced after the stock market closed. Earlier, Google shares rose 2 percent, to $429, after DealBook, a Web log published by nytimes.com, reported that a deal would be announced at the end of the market day. 
 Benjamin Schachter, a UBS analyst, wrote in a note to investors. ''The price tag of about $1.6 billion is difficult to justify on a spreadsheet and may be somewhat of a throwback to the days of paying for eyeballs and page views, but this is a strategic bet that Google would be placing for a long-term objective: to be the technology and distribution partner for content owners and publishers.''

 As technology pundits debated the pros and cons of a Google-YouTube deal in recent days, YouTube fans were doing the same -- in homemade videos they posted on YouTube itself. Here are some excerpts:

nxtoracle, age 22
www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPRU2DzWNsc

'' I think it would be awesome if Google bought YouTube. I think the ads would be minimized, I think the content would improve I think we'll see Google do a lot of things in the future that's more community-based like YouTube, and I think that tying in YouTube with everything would be a great move for them.''

xchylerjfk, 19
www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxyVjUL4lyc

'' I don't want them to take over YouTube because, as I said, Google are going to take over the whole of the Internet soon. Everyone will be forced to wear T-shirts which say ''Google.'' In the future I predict, in about 10 years, everything will be Google-controlled. Watch out.''

sgRocker1009, 18
www.youtube.com/watch?v=7joSlUFLrL0

'' I think it would be good for the site because [Google] have a ridiculous amount of resources, and that would mean faster downloads, faster uploads, better searching I also hope that whoever buys it doesn't start making all kinds of changes because that would not go over well with the YouTube community.''

ilikescreaming, 13
www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej26NGC3n6o

'' Google wants YouTube for $1.6 billion $1.6 billion? That's a lot of money. And I love it. Like, this is going to be like I don't even know what this is going to be. But it's going to be big. And I love it.''

HEADLINE: Bold Gestures on Myanmar Only Underscore Stagnation and Other Troubles 

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Oct. 8 

 BODY:
This is a moment of bold gestures from the generals who rule Myanmar and from their critics in the United States, but the gestures only underscore the state of suspended animation that has engulfed that broken country.
 In Myanmar this week, the generals are reconvening a seemingly endless convention that has been working, on and off, for 13 years to draw up a constitution. They portray the meeting as a start on their ''road map to democracy.''
In New York, the United States succeeded in September, after months of lobbying, in placing Myanmar's human rights record on the agenda of the United Nations Security Council. American diplomats call Myanmar a threat to international peace and security. 
 The statements by the two countries should not be taken literally. A consensus among experts on its years of stagnation and repression is that Myanmar, an isolated Southeast Asian nation, is neither heading toward democracy nor threatening world peace.
 Instead, the nation once known as Burma is staying pretty much where it has been since the military quashed a pro-democracy uprising by force in 1988. It remains one of the poorest and most repressed nations in Asia. 
 Its rulers feint and promise and hunker down; its critics recite its transgressions and impose economic sanctions; very little changes. In what has become a familiar dance, local opponents of the government are arrested, released and arrested again, and promises to free the pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi are made and then broken. She has spent 11 of the past 17 years under house arrest.
 Myanmar's official press reported this weekend that the first of 1,000 delegates had begun to gather from around the country for the opening of the convention on Tuesday after an eight-month hiatus.
 It is part of a process that would eventually put a civilian face on military rule, but Western experts say it would not mean any change in power or lead necessarily to any relaxation of repressive measures or the easing of human rights abuses.
 The draft constitution, as presented online, contains several clauses that ensure continued control by the military -- requiring the president to have 15 years of military service, allowing the military to declare a state of emergency and placing its budget outside civilian control. One third of parliamentary seats would be reserved as a bloc for active members of the armed forces.
 ''The National Convention, as you know, is heavily scripted,'' said David Steinberg, a professor at Georgetown University who is a leading expert on Myanmar. ''The government will get whatever it wants, it will finish whenever it wants to, and at some point in the future, they'll hold a referendum that they'll win and an election, which they'll also win, and the military will still be in control.''
 Or as some exiles from Myanmar like to say, ''General elections means elections of generals.''
 The military has controlled Myanmar since 1962, closing itself off from the outside world and killing thousands of people when it crushed the uprising in 1988.
 When the military suffered an overwhelming loss to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, in elections in 1990, it ignored the results and stayed in control. It then organized the constitutional convention in 1993 as a gesture toward forming a civilian government. But it was not long before delegates representing the National League for Democracy walked out of the convention, calling it a sham.
 In response to this political manipulation and to reports of abuses of human rights, the United States has led escalating international economic sanctions that have deepened Myanmar's self-imposed isolation.
 Washington halted new American business investments in 1997 and imposed bans on financial transactions and imports in 2003. Officials tied to the military junta have been denied visas to the United States.
 Myanmar's neighbors in Southeast Asia took the opposite tack, trying gently to influence the junta through a policy of friendly ''noninterference,'' until their patience ran out last year and they became more openly critical of the junta. Through it all, the generals have hardly changed their positions.
 ''I don't think practically it is easy for an outsider to cause Myanmar to change a political system,'' Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore said last month. ''In the case of Myanmar, they want to close themselves off from the world. So if you impose sanctions on them, they say: 'Thank you very much. I am very happy to live by myself.' ''
 If and when change comes, Mr. Steinberg said, it is likely to come from within the military. The hope in exerting international pressure, analysts say, is that it might accelerate any internal dynamic for change within the armed forces.
 So the inclusion of Myanmar on the agenda of the Security Council might be seen as what some countries call a ''noise barrage,'' a public outcry that can force those in power to react. 
 But it is unlikely that the council will take concrete action. Myanmar has a powerful patron and shield in China, and China, Russia and India have provided the trade and aid that have insulated it from international sanctions and criticisms.
 The United States ambassador to the United Nations, John R. Bolton, has argued that drug trafficking, a flood of refugees, human rights abuses and the spread of H.I.V. make Myanmar a threat to international peace.
 He cited a recent United Nations report that 1,147 political prisoners were being held, that 240 villages of minorities had been destroyed in the past four years, that AIDS cases and drug trafficking were widespread and that United Nations agencies were assisting 140,000 refugees along the border with Thailand.

HEADLINE: Mother to Daughter, Since Forever

BYLINE: By JULIA MOSKIN

 BODY:
LIKE its trees, Brooklyn's sukkahs sprout in unlikely places. 
 All over the borough, observant Jewish families spent the first week of October building sukkahs, outdoor rooms with open roofs, in preparation for the holiday of Sukkot, which began last Friday and ends this Friday. Perched on asphalt roofs and in concrete gardens, they will eat under the stars for a week to commemorate the Jews' biblical wanderings in the desert.
For one food-loving community within Brooklyn's sizable Jewish population, Sukkot has additional significance. 
 ''We always cook a lot, but for Sukkot, we do even more,'' said Aida Hasson, who grew up in Beirut and is part of Brooklyn's tight-knit community of Middle Eastern Jews. 
 This network of a few hundred families shares roots in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Egypt, and also an extraordinary culinary tradition. They use the term Syrian Jews, to distinguish themselves within the larger world of the Sephardim, the Jews of the Mediterranean. 
 ''We call ourselves Syrian, Sephardic, Middle Eastern, whatever,'' said Giselle Habert, who was born in Cairo. ''The important thing is that we all know each other, and we all cook the same things.'' 
 This community's favorites are labor-intensive dishes that are still passed down from mother to daughter: sambusak, crisp little half-moons stuffed with allspice-scented meat or tangy white cheese; mujadara, lentils and rice cooked together and thickly piled with gold-brown strands of onion; mahshi, vegetables like tiny eggplant and finger-size zucchini stuffed with spiced meat and rice; and kahk, sesame-sprinkled rounds of crumbly pastry. 
 ''Ours is the real, original cooking of the Jews,'' said Vicki Maijor, whose grandmother was born in Aleppo, Syria. In the Bible, she pointed out, when Esau sells his birthright, ''it is for lentil soup, isn't it?''
 Now spread over the world, ''the community,'' as its members call it, is defined mostly through family and religion, but also by its distinctive food, so different from the brisket and bagels of the Ashkenazic tradition most Americans are familiar with. 
 Ms. Hasson is famous in the community for her typically Lebanese fruit preserves, like tiny apples cooked in sugar syrup, jellied quince paste and finely shredded and candied spaghetti squash, all traditional sweets for the first month of the Jewish year, which began at sundown on Sept. 22. ''In Beirut, we all lived together, and the women cooked together all day long,'' she said. ''Everyone would sit down and help with the stuffing and the folding, someone would make a bowl of tabbouleh, and that way no one was alone doing all the work.'' 
 Middle Eastern cities like Damascus, Baghdad, Beirut and Alexandria all had flourishing Jewish neighborhoods for many centuries. But diasporas became common for many reasons, including the slow death of the camel-caravan economy in the 20th century, the Arab-Israeli wars and Egypt's expulsion of nearly all of its Jews between 1956 and 1967.
 And so the community has slowly reconstituted itself in Los Angeles, Tel Aviv, Paris and Brooklyn, revitalizing the Sephardic neighborhood around the intersection of Kings Highway and Ocean Parkway. Population estimates for the community in Brooklyn range from 30,000 to 50,000; Brooklyn's Jewish population overall is now about 500,000, according to a 2002 study by the UJA-Federation of New York.
 It is not surprising, given the repeated displacements of the centuries, that the community does not welcome attention from outsiders. But its cooking, which I first tasted at the bakeries and restaurants on Kings Highway, is so intriguing that over several months, I slowly persuaded some home cooks to open their kitchens. 
 Although they take their skills for granted -- ''I don't do anything special'' is the refrain -- their well-developed abilities to balance sweet and sour flavors, to weave together spices, simply to cook without recipes and put a home-cooked meal on the table virtually every night, are increasingly rare. 
 Sukkot is also the Jewish harvest festival, and in the community it has become a traditional time to feed 40, 60, even 100 guests -- and to set out almost that many different dishes. On the first night, my dinner began with seven different mezze, or appetizers, then continued with a green Egyptian soup called melokhia, spiked with vinegary scallions to cut its richness. It then moved on to two chickens mounded with rice and pine nut stuffing; brisket in a sweet and sour sauce; a roll of roasted kibbe (ground beef and rice) in cherry sauce; braised celery root and fennel in turmeric; and string beans with caramelized onions. For dessert, there was a plum tart, a pastry roll filled with homemade jam, and walnut-stuffed dates. 
 After the first two festive days, typical Sukkot meals are casseroles and stews -- like sofrito batatas, a spiced veal stew with fried potatoes mixed in -- that can be easily transported to the sukkah, and are warming on cold fall nights.
 Like Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish women, the women of this community keep kosher kitchens, define themselves first as wives and mothers, and rarely work outside the home. But in contrast to those purposefully modest women, these women are fashionable and even glamorous, blending in on the Brooklyn streets in tank tops and French-tip manicures. 
 ''In our community, it doesn't matter so much what we wear,'' said Fernanda Chemtob, who was born in Cairo and now lives in Brooklyn. ''We know who we are.'' They certainly do. Even women who have lived their whole lives in Brooklyn can taste if a cook's roots are in Egypt or Syria, depending on whether garlic and lemon, or allspice and tomato, are more dominant in her cooking. 
 ''We don't like anything bland,'' said Raquel Habert, one of Giselle's daughters-in-law. ''We are always adding flavor, flavor, flavor.'' 
 Florence Habert, another daughter-in-law and a new bride, shrugged off compliments on the pleating technique she uses to seal her sambusak. ''You watch your mother, you watch your grandmother, you love the way it tastes, so you have to learn to do it,'' she said. Developing the patience and dexterity to turn out these tiny pastries earns real respect in this community: a love for sambusak and lahmejun is like a badge of Syrian identity, and cooks say they are always the first to go at any gathering. 
 ''If you put out a thousand sambusak, they will eat a thousand sambusak,'' said Vicki Maijor, Raquel Habert's mother.
 According to Claudia Roden, an expert on Jewish cooking who grew up in the community in Cairo, brides-to-be with long fingers were especially prized -- the better to make classic dishes like stuffed zucchini and kibbe, ground beef stuffed into an impossibly thin shell of bulgur wheat. The women of the community still marry young -- 19 is considered an appropriate age -- and are then expected to learn to cook in earnest, preferably from their new mothers-in-law, who can instruct them on their new husbands' tastes. ''When my husband's aunts visited us, they would go straight to the kitchen,'' said Iris Towers, who married into the community in the 1950's. ''It was their job to teach me to make lahmejun and make sure the freezer was full when they left.''
 Among the women I met, at least part of every day is still devoted to cooking -- not only that night's dinner for her husband and children and often other relatives, but also for the engagements, circumcisions, birthdays, anniversary parties, card games and bake sales that fuel a constant cycle of entertaining and celebration. 
 In August, I went to one of the community's charity bake sales, held in a private home in the town of Deal on the New Jersey shore. Members of the community have spent summers there since the 1920's: its culinary bible, a two-volume cookbook published by the sisterhood of the local synagogue, is titled ''Deal Delights.'' Each summer, the community's butchers and other vendors from Kings Highway make deliveries to Deal or move there altogether, and the men commute to work in New York City via ferry. 
 There were at least 200 women at the sale, buying one another's challahs, jars of bazargan (a cracked wheat salad flavored with tamarind and pine nuts), and pistachio cookies. The bake sale went on for hours, and included seminars on how to make ''Syrian cheese,'' a mozzarella-like twist that is pulled into fine shreds, then eaten with olive oil and pita bread. The sale cleared almost $75,000, estimated one community member who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the group's strong taboos against discussing money with outsiders. 
 In the summer, even these demon cooks relax into a routine of grilled fish, salads and sandwiches by the pool. But as soon as they returned to Brooklyn, the women began stocking their freezers (many of them have not one but two large freezers in the basement) for autumn's Jewish holidays. ''We go from house to house for dinners and lunches,'' said Shirley Mosseri, a mother of four who was born and raised in Brooklyn. ''You can't say no to food in this community,'' she said as she expertly cored 20 small eggplants, removing all but the thinnest shell of purple skin, just as her grandmother had taught her. 
 In the community's kitchens, there are many young women like Mrs. Mosseri -- affluent, American-born, educated -- who have embraced its traditional strictures instead of melting into the American middle class, with its opportunities for secular education, two-income families, and take-out for dinner four times a week. 
 ''It took me a long time to get used to not shopping on the Sabbath, not watching TV, not driving, but now I like it,'' said Mrs. Mosseri, who attended a secular school and finished college. 
 Those who have taken steps away from the community criticize its conformity, its increasing religiosity, and its harsher traditions. An unmarried women of 29, one lapsed member told me, is considered worthy of only a decrepit or widowed groom. But for those who remain, cooking -- and, of course, endlessly talking about food -- cements their ties to one another and to the past. 
 ''You want to make it perfect, just like your grandmother did,'' Raquel Habert said. ''There's nothing in the world I'd rather be doing than this.''

Spiced Meat Pies (Lahmejun)
Adapted from Iris Towers
Time: About 45 minutes plus one hour's rising

For the dough (see note):
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, more for oiling pans

For the topping:
1 pound ground beef (not more than 85 percent lean)
1/4 cup tomato paste
1/2 onion, finely chopped
Juice of 1 lemon
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons allspice
1 tablespoon tamarind paste (available at Middle Eastern and Indian markets)
2 tablespoons pine nuts
Lemon wedges and coarse salt for sprinkling on top.

1. To make dough: Combine yeast and 2 tablespoons warm water and set aside for 5 minutes. Combine flour and salt in a large bowl; add oil, yeast mixture and a scant 1/2 cup warm water. Mix, using hands if necessary, until dough comes together: it should be elastic but not sticky. If needed, add a little more flour or water. Turn out onto a board (no need to flour it) and knead until soft and smooth, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place 1 hour.
2. When dough has risen, combine all ingredients for topping in a bowl. Divide dough in two and roll out on a floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Cut 3-inch rounds with a water glass or cookie cutter, stacking them between layers of wax paper. Roll and cut remaining dough.
3. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Spread a heaping tablespoon of meat mixture on each dough round, spreading all the way to the edge: meat mixture will shrink during baking. (Once assembled, pies can be frozen, stacked in wax paper, and then baked directly from freezer.) Arrange pies on 2 lightly oiled baking sheets. Bake 20 minutes, rotating pans halfway through baking. Serve hot, sprinkled with lemon juice and coarse salt.
Yield: About 2 dozen pies.
Note: Refrigerated pizza dough or dough from a pizzeria will work well in this recipe. Some Middle Eastern markets also stock frozen mini pastry rounds.

Spinach Cheese Pies
Adapted from Raquel Habert
Time: About 45 minutes

2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 large white onion, finely chopped
2 10-ounce boxes frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
3 eggs
1 cup cottage cheese
4 ounces Muenster cheese, coarsely grated
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 dozen mini pastry shells, 1 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter, or 1 9-inch pie crust (see Note)

1. Heat oil in a wide skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring, until transparent. Add spinach and cook, stirring, just until bright green; do not overcook. Transfer to a colander and let cool to room temperature.
2. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Transfer spinach to a large bowl and add eggs, cottage cheese, muenster cheese, salt and pepper; toss together lightly but thoroughly. Spoon into small pastry shells or into a crust-lined 9-inch pie pan. Fill shells or pie pan almost to top; do not pack filling. Arrange on baking sheets and bake 18 to 20 minutes, until puffed and golden brown on top; large pie will take longer. (Filled pies can be frozen and baked, directly from freezer.)
Yield: 2 dozen mini pies or one large pie.
Note: Spinach filling can be baked alone in a casserole and served as a side dish.

Veal Stew With Tomato, Allspice and Fried Potatoes (Sofrito Batatas)
Adapted from Giselle Habert
Time: About 2 1/2 hours

3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 pounds boneless veal, from shoulder or other fatty cut, cut into 3- to 4- inch chunks
Salt and pepper
1 large onion, chopped
1 tablespoon allspice
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup tomato paste
2 large Idaho potatoes
Oil for deep-frying.

1. In a heavy pot with a lid, heat oil over high heat. Sprinkle meat with salt and pepper and lightly brown on all sides, working in batches if necessary to avoid crowding pan. Remove meat as it is browned. To empty pot, add onion and cook, stirring, until soft and golden. Add spices and cook, stirring, a few seconds, then stir in tomato paste. Pour in 1 cup water and bring to a simmer, scraping up browned bits from bottom of pan.
2. Nestle meat into liquid, cover and cook at a bare simmer for at least 2 hours, turning meat every 20 minutes or so, until very soft and tender. Liquid will thicken to a sauce, but if it becomes too thick, add more water a little at a time.
3. When meat has cooked for 2 hours, peel potatoes and cut in half first lengthwise and then crosswise into 1/2-inch- thick half-moons. Heat 2 inches oil in another pot to about 375 degrees. Working in batches if necessary to avoid crowding pan, fry potatoes until just golden and cooked through but not soft, about 5 minutes. Drain.
4. When sauce is thick and meat is falling apart, stew is done; this may take up to 3 hours. If needed, break meat up with a wooden spoon. Stir in potatoes and mix gently but thoroughly, so that potatoes absorb sauce. Serve hot.
Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

HEADLINE: Satan or Savior: Setting the Grape Standard

BYLINE: By Eric Asimov

 BODY:
ENTER Michel Rolland, the world's most famous wine consultant -- perhaps the world's only famous wine consultant. In his natty blue suit, close-trimmed gray beard, carrying a sleek leather briefcase, Mr. Rolland looked ready for the boardroom rather than the vineyard, the cellar or the airport, his usual milieu. 
 He had arrived late this crisp September morning for a breakfast arranged by one of his American representatives at the Union League Club, a far cry from his stylish, very French hotel, Le Parker Meridien (no relation to his good friend, the wine writer Robert M. Parker Jr.). He had jetted over from France the previous day for a corporate tasting, and was dashing back to Pomerol, his home base, after our breakfast and a quick stop at the WNYC-AM studio downtown for an appearance on the Leonard Lopate radio show.
 If he seemed a little out of breath, it was only natural. Bordeaux was in the middle of its harvest, and he wanted to get back to it. ''It began a little earlier than we had expected,'' he said. With more than 100 clients spread out over five continents, it's hard to imagine Mr. Rolland not looking at his watch and whirling off. 
 Business these days is better than ever for Mr. Rolland, 59, who a year and a half ago had some reason to feel concerned. Back then, Jonathan Nossiter's documentary ''Mondovino'' had come out in France and was about to be released in the United States. The movie somewhat polemically posed a conflict between a pastoral, distinctively local wine culture and a globalized economy threatening to overwhelm it with crass marketing and homogenized consumerism. 
 Arch among the villainy assembled by Mr. Nossiter was Mr. Rolland, who is portrayed as the author of rich, plush, sellable wines that taste the same no matter where they are made. He appeared as a chauffeur-driven, cigarillo-waving consultant who only put down his cellphone to disparage the locals, all the while laughing, as one French reviewer put it, like Mephistopheles.
 Mr. Rolland went on the offensive, accusing Mr. Nossiter of manipulation and dishonesty, which Mr. Nossiter denied. Mr. Rolland's clients and good friends rose up in his defense. As a result, Mr. Rolland says, he emerged sympathetically rather than as a laughingstock, as he had feared.
 ''In terms of business, 'Mondovino,' it has been very positive,'' he said, laughing. 
 He does indeed laugh a lot, though not, as his friends take pains to point out, in a sinister way.
 ''Besides the fact that he's a genius, he's a lot of fun to have around,'' said Andy Erickson, a winemaker who has known Mr. Rolland for 12 years and worked with him at Harlan Estate, Staglin Family Vineyards and Ovid Vineyards, an ambitious new Napa Valley estate. ''He's got a way of expressing things and getting people behind him that makes everybody feel as if what they're doing is great, but maybe they can do it a little better.''
 In person, Mr. Roland is informal and down to earth, dunking his croissant in his coffee as we talk. His affect is modest, and he often repeats self-deprecating bromides -- ''A winemaker never, never changes the character of a wine. The character comes from the grapes.'' 
 Yet the laugh and the joking demeanor conceal a steely certainty and disdain for differing views.
 We spoke about the rising level of alcohol in wines and the trend toward allowing grapes to ripen longer before they are harvested. The resulting wines are bigger and more opulent, with sweeter fruit, softer tannins and an absence of herbal flavors that were once commonplace in cabernet sauvignon-based wines. I mention Clos du Val and Corison, two Napa Valley producers whose wines adhere to a less upfront, more austere style, and Mr. Rolland is strikingly dismissive. 
 ''Are they as successful in the marketplace? No,'' he said, warming to the subject. ''Wine is done for what? The public! Wine is a business. They want to make wine to sell wine. In the U.S. they are honest enough to tell you they want good ratings. They don't want loser wines.''
 MR. ROLLAND expresses astonishment that some people are nostalgic for the leaner, less ripe California style of the 1970's. There were good bottles then, he allows, but very few. ''I came to the U.S. in 1984 or '85 and I did a lot of tasting,'' he said. ''Now a young guy like me coming couldn't taste all the good wines in a week. Back then you could in an hour.''
 Needless to say, Mr. Rolland does not make loser wines, at least not according to the critical lights of American writers like Mr. Parker and Wine Spectator, whose ratings can often drive the market for wine. His clients include St.-Emilion luminaries like Angelus, Ausone and Valandraud as well as Pape Clement in Pessac-Leognan, Pontet-Canet in Pauillac, Ornellaia in Tuscany, and Harlan Estate, Bryant Family, Araujo and Dalla Valle in Napa. But Mr. Rolland does not restrict himself to celebrated winemakers. He also assists estates in Bulgaria, Greece, India and Brazil. He and his wife, Dany, who is also an enologist and winemaker, own or have an interest in 11 wineries, extending from Pomerol to Spain, South Africa and Argentina.
 Like Mr. Parker, he asserts that the wine market is far more diverse today than it has ever been before and, more important, the quality of wine has never been as good as it is now. He rejects the criticism that his favored style of ripe, voluptuous fruit flavors and supple textures is making wines taste the same from Pomerol to Napa to Argentina. 
 ''We have less globalization now than we had 20 years ago,'' he said. ''The big brands were much stronger back then. There were far fewer small producers. We aren't standardizing wines. We are just doing good wines.'' 
 In ''Mondovino,'' Michael Broadbent, the legendary British wine writer and auctioneer, criticized the changes Mr. Rolland had made to Chateau Kirwan, a middling Margaux estate that now, Mr. Broadbent said, tasted like a Pomerol. He added, ''I'd rather have an individual wine not up to scratch than a global wine that's innocuous.''
 It's a sentiment that still has Mr. Rolland fuming. ''I think English critics in general -- the English are used to drinking older wines,'' he said. ''Michael Broadbent is always speaking about the 1940's and 1960's. It's like they are stopped in time, like old people always looking back to the old days.''
 For his expertise, Mr. Rolland receives annual fees that start around $30,000 but can go considerably higher, depending on how much time he devotes to his client. At Ovid Vineyards, a new winery on Pritchard Hill on the east side of Napa Valley, Mr. Rolland visits four times a year, said Dana Johnson, who owns Ovid with her husband, Mark Nelson. 
 ''We always walk the vineyard,'' she said. ''He's very involved in helping us to make small adjustments and changes.'' The Ovid vines, planted in 2000 on a hillside with a stunning view of the valley below, are still young. The first Ovid vintage, 2005, won't be released until 2008. As in many vineyards, each discrete section of grapes is vinified and aged separately until it is time to blend them for bottling. 
 ALMOST all his clients marvel at his ability to find just the right blend. But Mr. Erickson, the winemaker at Ovid, sees Mr. Rolland's abilities as much broader. ''The way he can taste the grapes and envision the way the wine is going to taste, it's something that's really learned,'' he said. ''Knowing when to harvest the grapes, knowing when to intervene in the winery and, more importantly, knowing when not to intervene.''
 Mr. Rolland was born in Pomerol in 1947 and grew up in the winemaking business. His father ran the family estate, Chateau Le Bon-Pasteur, and he grew up drinking the aged wines that his grandfather selected. ''We never drank wines younger than 12 years old,'' he said.
 Such aging was fine for those days, Mr. Rolland says, but people today don't have the money, the storage or the patience to wait as long as his grandfather did. It's a feeling that has shaped the way he makes wines.
 ''We had to change that,'' he said. ''Consumers today like to drink much sooner.''
 Mr. Rolland's enthusiasm for wine has taken him far off the beaten trail. He is a consultant to Grover Vineyards in the Nandi Hills in India, north of Bangalore, and while he says the wine isn't much yet, he is proud of the progress he's made in the 10 years he's been involved. He has also explored Chinese efforts to make wine, though he's not involved in any projects there.
 ''My curiosity is intact,'' he said. ''I love to see new vineyards and new projects.'' 
 That curiosity has not yet led him to New Zealand and Australia. Why not? Mr. Rolland laughs. ''Too much travel.''

HEADLINE: Philanthropy From the Heart Of America

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Valley County, not far from the center of Nebraska, seemed to be one of those Great Plains communities that was dying. From World War II to 2000 it had lost almost half its population, and the decline was gathering speed at the end of the century. The I.G.A. and Jack & Jill grocery stores closed, as did most mom and pop gas stations and the local dairy processing plant.
 In the last five years, though, something utterly unexpected has happened. The decline has stopped. More people are moving to Ord, the county seat, than leaving, and the county's population is likely to show its first increase this decade since the 1920's. 
 The economics of rural America have not really changed. If anything, the advantages that Chicago, Dallas, New York and other big cities have over Nebraska have only continued to grow. But Ord has finally figured out how to fight back.
 It has hired a ''business coach'' to help teach local stores how to sell their goods over the Internet and to match up retiring shop owners with aspiring ones. Schoolchildren learn how to start their own little businesses -- like the sixth-grade girl who made a video of the town's history and sells it at school reunions -- so they will not grow up to think the only job opportunities are at big companies in Omaha or St. Louis. Graduates of Ord High School who have moved elsewhere receive mailings telling them about job opportunities back in town. 
 None of this happens naturally in a free-market economy, because the efforts cost money that will never be fully recouped. But it has happened nonetheless thanks to one of the few advantages that Ord does have over Chicago, Dallas and New York: it is in a state with some of the most generous wealthy people in the country.
 In San Francisco, a retired money manager named Claude Rosenberg has founded a small organization called New Tithin g Group. It tries to persuade Americans to base their charitable giving on their assets as well as their income, given how many now have substantial assets. And using tax returns, NewTithing has put together a devilish ranking of the 50 states.
 It began by estimating the liquid assets of households with more than $200,000 in annual income, counting cash, stocks, bonds and the like, but not houses or retirement accounts. Then, with the same federal tax data, it calculated what percentage of those assets the households have given to charity, on average, in recent years. 
 Nebraska ranked third, with its affluent residents giving away just over 1 percent of their assets each year. That does not include the state's most famous donation, Warren E. Buffett's huge gift to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation this year, which came too late to be counted in the ranking. But it does include many smaller gifts to local charities like the Nebraska Community Foundation, which is trying to resuscitate Ord and other towns. 
 What is striking about the top of NewTithing's list is that it is dominated by a group of states that run from the Rockies through the Plains and down into the Southeast. The only ones ahead of Nebraska were Utah (where the Mormon Church asks members to donate 10 percent of their incomes) and Oklahoma, while Minnesota and Georgia came next. 
 As Emmett D. Carson, president of the Minneapolis Foundation, points out, these are places that do not have many beaches, famous cultural institutions or other obvious ways to attract residents. ''So how do you build a community that is a destination?'' Mr. Carson asked. ''You have to be a lot more intentional about it.'' 
 The states with beaches and museums, those that have been winning a growing share of the nation's economic pie, generally failed to crack the top 20 in the ranking. The average affluent resident of New York (23rd on the list) or Florida (41st) owns about one-third more assets than the average affluent Nebraskan, but the Nebraskan still gives away a bigger pile of money. Also lagging are California (21st), Virginia (25th), Massachusetts (32nd), Texas (34th) and Washington (35th). 
 No single list, of course, can fully capture how generous a state's residents are. Through federal taxes, wealthy states like California and New York transfer a significant amount of money to poorer states every year. The NewTithing ranking, by its nature, also fails to count donations that are not tax-deductible, like informal gifts and time spent on community service. 
 But the ranking makes an important point. The middle of the country has developed a culture of philanthropy that the coasts and the Southwest, for all their wealth, do not yet have. Ord is never going to turn into anything resembling New York, no matter what it does. But New York could become a little more like Ord and, in the process, blunt some of the rough edges of inequality that have come with prosperity.
 There is even a bit of evidence that some people on the coasts are starting to catch on. Next week, Mr. Carson will be leaving the Minneapolis foundation he has run for 12 years to take over the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. Part of his mandate, he said, is to transplant some of Minnesota's culture to the donors of Northern California. 
 ''They have the wealth,'' he said. ''They want to capitalize on it and build a community.''

HEADLINE: Levine's Economy Of Gesture

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
With the shoulder injury that put him out of action last season fully behind him, and a summer at Tanglewood to get limber, James Levine has returned to his full workload at the Boston Symphony, which he brought to New York on Monday evening for the first of its three Carnegie Hall concerts this season. 
 But if you're expecting him to have become an arm-swinging hip shaker in the Lorin Maazel mold, forget it: Mr. Levine, though looking notably more flexible than in recent seasons, still conducts from a high stool, and his gestures remain nearly microscopic, in the Fritz Reiner tradition, much of the time.
But what of it? With both the Boston Symphony and the Met Orchestra, Mr. Levine's barely perceptible gestures clearly convey both bold strokes and subtleties to his musicians. As he once told a conducting master class at Tanglewood, the important part is what you project in front of you, to the orchestra, not behind you, to the audience. 
 Mr. Levine's program on Monday was split between Schoenberg and Beethoven. Often you had the sense that he would have loved to compress the distance between them, and there were times when he succeeded. His obsessive attention to dynamic and balancing details in the Schoenberg Piano Concerto and the Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 4 cast both as Romantic high dramas, Beethoven's Classicism and Schoenberg's Serialism notwithstanding. 
 Strangely, the odd work out wasn't Schoenberg's concerto but his early ''Verklarte Nacht.'' The Mahlerian lushness of this 1899 score would have been alien to Beethoven, and Schoenberg had abandoned that language long before he wrote the Piano Concerto in 1942. 
 Mr. Levine, leading a huge ensemble in Schoenberg's later string orchestra expansion, took every opportunity to magnify the score's gestures: dramatic passages had a molten intensity, and pianissimo writing was about as hushed as string players can be while still moving their bows. Where Schoenberg wrote a diminuendo, Mr. Levine often responded with a sweeping gesture in which a phrase began with a brawny robustness and quickly melted into silence. 
 Daniel Barenboim was the soloist in both concertos, and he and Mr. Levine seemed to be of one mind. Their reading of the Schoenberg was vivid and punchy, with an assertive and sometimes zesty piano line set within a thoroughly tactile orchestral fabric. As in ''Verklarte Nacht,'' Mr. Levine's manipulation of color and dynamics bordered on micromanagement, but invariably proved expressive rather than merely fussy. 
 The Beethoven, handled in much the same way, sometimes crossed that line: the pianissimo rendering of the first bars in the finale, for example, had a daintiness that accomplished little more than showing off an effect Mr. Levine had already used amply throughout the evening. 
 Mr. Barenboim's Beethoven was big-boned and warm in the opening Allegro, and fleet in the finale. But he was at his best -- and his collaboration with Mr. Levine was at its most satisfying -- in a graceful, fluid account of the Andante con moto. 

James Levine and the Boston Symphony return to Carnegie Hall on Nov. 11; (212) 247-7800.

HEADLINE: A Pro-Business City Policy Backfires on a Few 

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
After struggling for more than two decades, Harvey Shomer says, he finally found his niche in the city's dwindling garment industry. Operating out of 5,000 square feet in a dilapidated brick building in Brooklyn, his company, M. Franabar Associates, corrects mistakes in bulk orders arriving from manufacturers in China -- the upside-down labels, the incorrect price tags and the missing bar codes.
 Many of Franabar's 26 employees walk to work, passing under the Gowanus Expressway, the dividing line between the industrial and residential sections of Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood.
 In June, however, Mr. Shomer and the owners of 25 other businesses that rent space in a cluster of three century-old industrial buildings along the waterfront learned that the city planned to sell the complex, which is fully occupied, to a developer who would rehabilitate it. 
 The tenants, who provide work for about 300 people, say private redevelopment of the buildings would be likely to result in sizable rent increases, forcing them to leave the city or close their businesses. 
 The city is weighing proposals for the three brick buildings, which sit between 41st and 43rd Streets -- including one from a nonprofit group that would keep the current tenants and let them eventually buy their spaces. The buildings, completed between 1895 and 1905, contain 460,000 square feet. They are part of the Bush Terminal Complex, which stretches from 41st Street to 51st Street.
 New York's industrial companies provide about 466,000 jobs, but space has become increasingly scarce, especially with the recent rezoning of large swaths of industrial neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Greenpoint in Brooklyn to permit the more lucrative residential development. 
 In Sunset Park, for example, the vacancy rate in industrial buildings was less than 1 percent, said Phaedra Thomas, the executive director of the Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corporation, a nonprofit economic development group. 
 The Bloomberg administration has been aggressively trying to nurture light manufacturing in New York by upgrading city-owned industrial real estate, like the three Bush Terminal buildings; offering tax credits and other incentives; and creating 16 protective zones, where residential conversions are banned, in Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx. 
 But the possibility that several hundred jobs may be lost when the city sells the three Bush Terminal buildings has drawn criticism from economic development advocates who otherwise praise the administration's industrial policy as the best in decades. 
 Jonathan Bowles, the director of the Center for an Urban Future, a New York research organization, said the administration should have given the tenants an opportunity to buy the building or renegotiate their leases before putting the complex on the market.
 ''It doesn't seem right, what the city is doing,'' he said. ''It doesn't seem to jibe with the recent policies to try to help industrial businesses.'' But Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the city Economic Development Corporation, said that it would be illegal for the city to negotiate with one group before issuing a request for proposals.
 Carl Hum, director of the mayor's 21-month-old Office of Industrial and Manufacturing Businesses, said tenants in the Bush Terminal buildings were paying rents ''that you cannot find anywhere else in the city.''
 Mr. Hum said the city should not be propping up businesses that would not exist if not for the below-market rent. ''Our focus is to support businesses that are viable, not businesses with operating costs that are artificially low,'' he said. The prospective buyers have all assured the city that they would offer help to the existing tenants, Mr. Hum said.
 The tenants acknowledge that some of them are paying rents that are well below market rate. Fox Paper, a distributor of plastic and paper party items, moved into Building C 21 years ago, when Sunset Park was plagued by drug dealers and prostitutes. The owner, Larry Fox, said he pays an annual rent of less than $4 a square foot for 35,000 feet on the ground floor.
 The market rate for such space in older loft buildings is $10 to $12 a square foot, while space on higher floors may go for $6 or $7 a foot, industrial brokers say.
 Upper-floor tenants, including companies that make high-end furniture, kitchen cabinet doors and lingerie, say they pay $5 or more a square foot for substandard space. The elevator continually breaks down and a power failure can disrupt their business for days, they said. 
 For several years, the business owners in Building C have been month-to-month tenants, frustrated by the city's unwillingness to grant them leases. But they said the city had never told them it planned to sell the buildings. They say they were shocked when the city Economic Development Corporation informed them by letter on June 26 that it would issue a request for proposals for the building that very day.
 Undaunted, Mr. Shomer, who has been in his building for six years, decided to take action. ''I got a crazy idea. I got the guys together and said, 'Let's buy the building.' ''
 But a group of tenants would not have met the city's criteria for prospective buyers. So instead, the tenants sought help from local politicians and business assistance groups. Ms. Thomas's group, Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Corporation, steered them to several potential buyers, including the Fifth Avenue Committee, a local nonprofit developer with extensive experience in low-cost housing. The tenants selected Fifth Avenue, which agreed to offer each tenant a 10-year lease with an option to buy. 
 ''It was smart to get the Fifth Avenue Committee involved,'' Ms. Thomas said. ''They have access to creative financing tools.''
 The Fifth Avenue bid includes Building C and the better-maintained Building B, where a manufacturing company called Fixture Hardware has been a tenant since 1947. ''If I have to move, I'd close the business,'' said the owner, Kenneth L. Weiss. (A plastics company that is the lone tenant in the third building filed a separate proposal to buy that property.) 
 State Senator Martin J. Golden, a Brooklyn Republican, said he was a strong supporter of the Fifth Avenue bid. ''It's unusual to see businesses organizing for their own self-preservation,'' he said.
 Mr. Golden also helped persuade the city Economic Development Corporation to buy a long-vacant 1.1-million-square-foot building on Third Avenue at 30th Street in Sunset Park from the federal government to create more space for local industrial businesses. With its partner, the Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit business assistance group, the city is selecting a developer for the building. 
 Construction on the Third Avenue site is not expected to begin until 2008. But the administration can already point to some successes in its campaign to help light industry. Since April 2005, the city has stepped up its enforcement against illegal conversions of industrial buildings to other uses, Mr. Hum said. The city Buildings Department has issued 470 violations involving more than 70 buildings, said Jennifer Givner, a spokeswoman. Sixteen stop-work orders have been issued, she said.
 Ross F. Moskowitz, a real estate partner at the law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, said he advised clients not to bother seeking variances in the 16 areas designated as industrial business zones, ''where the administration has clearly articulated a policy of maintaining a manufacturing base.''
 There is no question that the new policies have ''thrown a bit of cold water on the market'' for conversions, said Brian T. Coleman, chief executive of the Greenpoint Manufacturing Design Center, a nonprofit real estate company that develops industrial space. But he and other advocates for industrial businesses said they worried that the new industrial business zones might not outlast the Bloomberg administration. 
 ''At least for the time being,'' Mr. Coleman said, ''the Wild West conditions that existed before I.B.Z.'s will no longer be tolerated.''

HEADLINE: Dow Sets Record, Barely, as Earnings Data Is Awaited

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks ended slightly higher yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average reaching a record close after a seesaw session, as investors proceeded cautiously before the unofficial start of the third-quarter earnings period.
 ''This market just doesn't want to go down. I keep waiting for a pullback, but it doesn't seem to be happening,'' said Rick Campagna, portfolio manager at Provident Investment Council in Pasadena, Calif. ''It will be interesting to see what happens with earnings. I've got to believe the economy is slowing and that there will be tempering of guidance for the fourth quarter.''
The Dow gained 9.36 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at a record 11,867.17, after hitting a record intraday high of 11,877.90. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.76 points, or 0.2 percent, to finish at 1,353.42. The Nasdaq composite index added 3.66 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 2,315.43. 
 The aluminum producer Alcoa, the first of the 30 companies in the Dow average to report results for the period, said after the closing bell that its third-quarter profit almost doubled. Analysts had expected the company to report sharply higher results, but earnings and revenue fell short of estimates.
 Alcoa fell to at least $26.61 in after-hours trading after closing at $28.29, up 30 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 During the regular session, shares of Qualcomm, a maker of cellphone handset chips, rose 2.3 percent, or 83 cents, to close at $37.07 on Nasdaq. An International Trade Commission judge found that Qualcomm had infringed on some of Broadcom's patents, but did not ban the United States sale of phones with Qualcomm's chips. Broadcom shares fell 2.7 percent, or 79 cents, to $28.80 in Nasdaq trading.
 Other gainers included shares of home builders. The Dow Jones United States home construction index rose 2.9 percent after J. P. Morgan Securities said it had removed its cautious near-term stance and reasserted a more bullish posture on the home building group.
 J. P. Morgan upgraded D. R. Horton and Standard Pacific to overweight from neutral, while raising Toll Brothers to neutral from underweight. D. R. Horton shares rose 3.9 percent, or 92 cents, to $24.76, Standard Pacific gained 4.9 percent, or $1.25, to $26.62, and Toll Brothers climbed 5.1 percent, or $1.48, to $30.29.
 The grocery chain Supervalu rose 4.5 percent, or $1.38, to $32.39 after it posted quarterly profit that almost quadrupled, helped by its purchase of the rival chain Albertsons.
 Google shares slipped 0.6 percent, or $2.35, to $426.65, a day after it announced a deal to buy YouTube for $1.65 billion in stock. 
 About 1.50 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with last year's daily average of 1.61 billion. On Nasdaq, 1.82 billion shares traded; last year's daily average was 1.80 billion.
 Prices of United States Treasury securities slipped, sending benchmark yields to three-week highs, as investors pared expectations that the Federal Reserve would soon cut rates to expand economic growth. Fed officials said inflation remained a top concern, despite evidence of a housing-led slowdown that will eventually cool upward price pressure.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year note fell 15/32, to 100 30/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.75 percent from 4.69 percent on Friday. (The bond market was closed Monday for the Columbus Day holiday.)

HEADLINE: Hard Math In Oil Cuts Splits OPEC

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Once again, OPEC is finding that it is much easier to agree when prices rise than when they fall.
 After nearly a week of anguished calls, OPEC ministers are still debating how to put a brake on falling oil prices, which have dropped nearly 25 percent since their high in mid-July.
OPEC's current president, Edmund Daukoru, who is the Nigerian oil minister, has said that ''something must be done,'' and proposed that OPEC reduce production by a million barrels a day, from a nominal ceiling of 28 million barrels. 
 But instead of presenting a united front, OPEC's 11 members have found it hard to agree on how quickly to act and how the cuts should be shared, confusing oil markets. In New York yesterday, the price of crude oil for November delivery dropped 2.4 percent, to an eight-month low of $58.52 a barrel, as traders questioned OPEC's resolve.
 This is the time OPEC should have been bracing itself for -- the first quota cut in two years. Instead, as an analyst from Societe Generale noted, ''OPEC failed its return to discipline.''
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is not a homogenous group but a collection of countries with divergent political and economic interests. As oil prices more than doubled over the last three years, OPEC members found it easy to agree on a common policy that resulted in windfall revenue for their governments. 
 But with prices now falling, that consensus is fraying. Iran and Venezuela have called for a special meeting in Vienna next week to endorse production cuts. Others, like Kuwait and Algeria, have backed the proposal but disagree on how to apportion the cuts. And Nigeria has resisted calls for a meeting next week to avoid overshadowing OPEC's next scheduled conference, to be held in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, in December.
 Crucially, the group's most influential member, Saudi Arabia, has remained conspicuously silent. The Saudis are understood to support a production cut, but OPEC watchers reason that the country, which accounts for a third of OPEC's output, wants to be discreet just weeks before the midterm elections in the United States. 
 With bickering in the ranks and without clear leadership from Saudi Arabia, analysts are left weighing vague signs to figure out what OPEC is up to. 
 Paul Horsnell of Barclays Capital, said, ''The Kremlinology of OPEC is back.''
 In the last two years, OPEC producers have been steadily increasing their output to meet rising demand for oil and to make up for unexpected shortages in global supplies. That has led the group to raise its total output above 30 million barrels a day, the highest level in more than 25 years.
 Now, with supplies aplenty, inventories brimming and demand slowing, OPEC finds itself having to shift its focus to manage a declining price pattern, reducing its production to keep world prices above certain levels. 
 Because OPEC has not formally reduced its ceiling on output since April 2004, any talk of how to divide the lower production is certain to lead to acrimonious negotiations as countries fight to keep their market share. One option being discussed is to reduce the group's actual production by a million barrels a day while using the current quotas to calculate each country's contribution. 
 Because some producers have been paring their output in recent months, OPEC now produces 27.5 million to 27.8 million barrels a day, depending on estimates. That excludes oil from Iraq, which has no production quota. 
 Referring to OPEC, Sadek Boussena, a former president of the group and a former oil minister from Algeria, said: ''They have had no training for nearly two years. It's like a football game. Right now, they are warming up for a friendly game. But if prices fall further, it might become vital for them to act.'' 
 OPEC did away with its quotas last year when its members pumped at maximum capacity, but its effectiveness as a cartel comes from allocating output targets to its members and sticking to them. 
 In the past, quota compliance has proved notoriously difficult, as renegade members would regularly disregard their allocations while pretending to adhere to OPEC agreements.
 In the 1980's, widespread quota violations led to a production war initiated by Saudi Arabia -- which basically opened its spigots and flooded the market with oil, leading to a price collapse -- to bring recalcitrant members back into line. That is an experience no one in the organization wants to see happen again.
 After years of low prices, producers have gotten used to today's higher prices. They need the higher revenue to finance their booming economies, their huge investments in energy projects and in real estate. Arab gulf countries, led by Saudi Arabia, will spend an estimated $700 billion by 2010, according to the latest report on the region by the International Monetary Fund.
 ''After two years of free-for-all production, going back to quotas is difficult,'' said Manouchehr Takin, an energy analyst at the Center for Global Energy Studies in London. ''But they know that if they don't get back their discipline quickly, if they don't control the leakage and the cheating, they can lose the market.''
 Some countries -- including Algeria, Libya and Qatar -- are producing way above their nominal quotas and will resist calls to return to the old allocations and give up some of their market share. 
 For example, Algeria produces 1.4 million barrels a day and aims to raise its capacity to 2 million barrels in coming years. Yet its quota is 894,000 barrels. 
 From a quite different perspective, Iran, Nigeria, Venezuela and Indonesia are having trouble meeting their quotas but will be loath to give up their allocations.
 Venezuela's production slumped after a devastating strike by oil workers late in 2002 and the country has since found it tough to increase its output to more than 2.5 million barrels a day. Yet it still has a quota of 3.2 million barrels. 
 And Indonesia, which has a quota of 1.45 million barrels but pumps only 860,000 barrels, too little for its own domestic consumption, has become a net importer of oil. 
 So deciding where the new quotas should stand will be a real challenge, and OPEC's ministers studiously avoided the topic for the last two years. But analysts say that the organization cannot put off the discussion any longer. 
 ''Pandora's box has been opened,'' Frederic Lasserre of Societe Generale said.

HEADLINE: BMW Has Maxi Expectations for Its Next, Slightly Larger Mini Cooper

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting from Detroit.

DATELINE: OXFORD, England 

 BODY:
At first glance down the assembly line at BMW's plant here, it's almost impossible to tell the new Minis from the newer Minis.
 Even the workers have to glance at television screens, which show each car in every color. On a recent Saturday, a black Mini Cooper S was followed by a red convertible and finally by a bright ochre Mini that was the latest version for 2007. Only its headlights and its slightly bigger size set it off from its siblings.
All of which raises an obvious question: Is this version of the Mini different enough to keep its outsize buzz going for a second generation?
 It is no mean feat -- the industry abounds with cars of the moment whose moment has passed, most notably Volkswagen's New Beetle, to which the Mini is most frequently compared. 
 Like Mini, the New Beetle got off to a fast start, only to lose steam several years later -- something Mini has avoided so far. One sign of its success is that at a time when many car companies routinely offer $3,000 or more in rebates and other deals, there have never been such discounts, only some lease deals, on Minis, which typically sell for $18,000 to $25,000.
 That is why much of the auto industry is watching the new Mini's introduction as an important marketing case study. 
 So far, the Mini has helped create an entirely new category of ''personality'' small cars like the Scion models sold by Toyota. These cars are bought not for their size or fuel economy but for their styling and overall cachet, said Karl Bauer, the editor in chief of Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers car-buying advice.
 A key reason both cars are so popular is that owners can customize them with almost every imaginable option, making Mini a challenge to build even if it does not appear to be that different from the next Mini on the line.
 The modern incarnation of the swinging 1960's car, originally designed in 1959 by Sir Alex Issigonis (as an homage to John Cooper, the famed race designer), became an industry darling in Japan, Europe and especially the United States, where Mini barely made an impression in its early years. Although it remained on the market for more than 30 years in its native Britain, only 20,000 Minis were sold over more than three decades in the United States.
 All that changed with the latest Mini, introduced in 2002 in an unprecedented marketing blitz that followed a similar effort in Europe the year before. All told, 875,000 Minis have been sold worldwide in 70 countries since then.
 When it was introduced, Mini meant almost nothing in the United States, save to people who remembered that the Beatles each owned one. So to build demand, the company used a sales strategy that mirrored the car's less-is-more size.
 BMW allowed just 70 dealers to sell the car. They were deluged with orders from the start, remarkable given that only 2 percent of Americans had ever heard of the original car in 1999, according to surveys by BMW, which builds the Mini. 
 There was no national television advertising and the car was promoted primarily on the Internet, in ads painted on city buildings and on cards handed out at auto shows. 
 BMW put Minis on top of sport utilities and drove them around 24 cities, including New York. Because of all that, Mini has sold five times as many cars -- more than 100,000 -- as it ever sold in the United States during the earlier incarnation. 
 ''They did that by having it be very cool-looking, with fun driving dynamics and all kinds of options,'' said Mr. Brauer.
 Not everyone was ready for the Mini. It proved too small for some owners who did not feel comfortable driving it amid tractor-trailers on the highway. 
 Moreover, BMW recommends that owners use premium unleaded gasoline, which shot above $4 a gallon in parts of the country this summer.
 But many owners get around those discomforts by adding a Mini to their household fleet, not relying on it for their sole transportation.
 That was the case for Chris Tuveson, a 41-year-old urologist in Fond du Lac, Wis. 
 He still owns a Mitsubishi Montero S.U.V. but prefers driving his silver 2006 Mini Cooper S, even though it is too small to hold his children or much more than a doctor's satchel.
 The Mini ''has become my fun and my workhorse car,'' he said. ''My S.U.V. just sits unless I need it for something big.''
 With buyers like that, everyone at BMW, from chief executive Norbert Reithofer on down, say they believe it could sell far more Minis. ''It will be a success story in the future, definitely,'' he said.
 Yet it has deliberately limited American sales to about 25,000 annually, out of the 200,000 that this plant produces each year. 
 Through September, just 21,400 Minis were sold in the United States, essentially the same as in 2005, according to statistics from Autodata. By comparison, that is about half the number of Camry sedans that Toyota sold in September alone. 
 But BMW has big plans, relatively speaking, for Mini. 
 First up is the new version, designed at BMW's headquarters in Munich (BMW consulted Rover on the previous model but entered development late in the game). The latest Mini goes on sale in Europe next month and in the United States next year as a 2008 model.
 Along with a slightly bigger body, its most important new features are six airbags, instead of four, and new engines -- gasoline and diesel, the latter sold outside the United States -- that get 20 percent better fuel economy. 
 The only similar personality cars are the three Scion models sold by Toyota dealers, deliberately aimed at the industry's youngest buyers (in theory, anyway, since plenty of their parents are taking them home). Their strongest selling feature aside from their funky styling is the fact that buyers can pick out just about everything, from the color of the dashboard to the power of the stereo system.
 Mini buyers have free rein, too. They can select from 372 different interior options, from fabric or leather seats to the steering wheel cover, and 319 exterior options, like wide racing stripes on the hood. That makes Mini the closest thing to a custom-built car in its size and price.
 About two-thirds of customers choose all the features they want on their cars, while the rest take home something that a dealer brought in, said Anton Heiss, general manager of BMW's Oxford operations. That puts heavy pressure on the Oxford plant to make sure cars are built on schedule and shipped promptly. ''If it is not perfect, it can be a nightmare,'' Mr. Heiss said.
 At one spot on the assembly line, a blue cloth bag containing the car's electrical wiring is tossed inside the empty car body, which is swarmed by eight workers at the next station.
 One worker seizes the bag, pulling out the cables and aiming the empty bag at a nearby bin. Others stretch out the wiring from front to back, some workers hopping inside to attach it to connectors, others securing it inside the hood. 
 The infinite choices mean that parts for Minis are sorted in advance, then brought to the assembly line in plastic bins, instead of having workers take time to search for them. 
 Big components, like seats and the dashboard, are delivered by suppliers just before they are installed.
 The determination of the Mini workers in part reflects the relief that they have jobs at all. There has been a factory on this site, about two hours from London, since the 1920's. But as the British auto industry deteriorated, so did employment here, where BMW built Rover cars until it sold the brand in 2000.
 These workers are about to get much more to do. Late next year, along with building the new version of Mini, the plant will add a wagonlike Mini, called the Traveller, with a longer body and more space. The year after will bring a new version of the convertible. Beyond that, BMW will not say what its plans are for the brand.
 But no matter what, executives are determined to protect it, said Michael Ganal, the BMW board member in charge of Mini. ''It is all about the brand,'' Mr. Ganal said in an interview at the Paris Motor Show. Mr. Ganal said BMW was determined to avoid the boom and bust phenomenon that afflicted the New Beetle. Its sales peaked at 83,000 in 1999, its first full year on the market, but VW is on track to sell fewer than half that number this year.
 If BMW can attract more buyers as loyal as Dr. Tuveson, it may not have to worry. He plans to keep his Mini no matter what else his family is driving. ''I'll hold onto that car until it dies,'' he said.

HEADLINE: H.P. Could Be a Finger-Pointing Case

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL; Laurie J. Flynn contributed reporting from San Jose, Calif.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
The five defendants in the Hewlett-Packard spying case must overcome a paper trail of evidence against them. But they could wind up with as much to fear from one another.
 At least one lawyer involved in the case and several outside legal experts said the five defendants might wind up turning on one another as part of a way to shift blame away from themselves.
''It's every man for himself,'' said Stephen Naratil, the lawyer for Bryan Wagner, who is charged with having misrepresented himself to phone companies to obtain calling records of Hewlett-Packard directors. ''Everyone is going to pass the buck down, and that's where my guy is sitting.''
 Mr. Naratil said he would not be surprised ultimately to see conflict between the lawyers for the company's former chairwoman, Patricia C. Dunn, and its former head of ethics, Kevin T. Hunsaker. ''They're going to point fingers at each other and other executives.'' 
 His comments, and interviews with lawyers for the other defendants, have begun to bring preliminary shape to a defense strategy in a case that is moving from the political and media stage to the courtroom.
 At a joint arraignment hearing on Tuesday in San Jose, Calif., Mr. Wagner and two private investigators -- Ronald R. DeLia and Matthew DePante -- pleaded not guilty and agreed to return to court on Nov. 17 for a preliminary hearing along with Ms. Dunn and Ms. Hunsaker.
 It is not yet clear whether the defendants will be tried together or separately. It is possible that one or more defendants could choose to cooperate with the prosecution and testify against others.
 But lawyers for any of the defendants could also try to shade the evidence in a way that is more favorable to their client and less so to another defendant. If the cases are severed, evidence presented in one trial could be subpoenaed in another trial. 
 Prosecutors want to try all the defendants at once. ''We will resist any attempt to sever the prosecution of the case,'' said Tom Dresslar, a spokesman for Attorney General Bill Lockyer, citing the interest of ''judicial economy.'' 
 Legal experts and lawyers in the case said that for all five defendants, the case was likely to be fought not just on the facts but also on the law. If there is one theme that will unify the defendants, legal experts said, it is that they will seek to challenge whether California law is even applicable to ''pretexting'' -- a technique involving misrepresentation to get personal and calling records.
 The defendants are said to have engaged in a conspiracy to obtain such records to determine the identity of a director who Ms. Dunn and others thought was giving confidential information to the news media.
 ''The thing we're most interested in is whether the statutes selected for charging do not address the alleged conduct,'' said Richard J. Preira, co-counsel for Mr. DePante. Mr. Preira said the defense lawyers ''have a common interest in educating the court as to the inapplicability of the statutes.''
 The defendants are each charged with four felony counts. Among the charges, the state accuses them of violating laws against knowingly gaining unauthorized access to computer data to devise or execute a scheme, or using the data to defraud or deceive, or for unlawful purposes.
 Legal experts said there would certainly be a vigorous pretrial debate about whether the laws fitted the charges. The legal experts themselves are sorely divided on the question.
 ''The statutes would have to be expansively interpreted in order to reach pretexting,'' said Joseph A. Grundfest, professor of law and business at Stanford University. ''But courts have interpreted statutes expansively before.''
 In a recent interview, Mr. Lockyer, the attorney general, said, ''I think our laws are sufficient to cover the behavior.''
 Ms. Dunn's lawyer, Jim Brosnahan, declined to discuss many aspects of his strategy. But he said he might argue that his client had not ordered anyone to commit an illegal act and had not known one was being committed.
 ''If the attorney general has progressed against Pattie Dunn on the theory she didn't have to know she was doing anything wrong or didn't have to order that something be done wrong, the weakness of that case will be subject to some very interesting motions,'' Mr. Brosnahan said.
 Ms. Dunn also hinted at her own strategy in an interview broadcast Sunday on ''60 Minutes.'' She said she did not recall -- as prosecutors assert -- that she had given home phone numbers of Hewlett-Packard board members to Mr. DeLia, the investigator.
 She also rejected contentions, indicated in interview notes from Hewlett-Packard's outside lawyer, that she had been told that investigators might have to use false pretenses to obtain calling records. 
 But legal experts said Ms. Dunn might not have done her defense team any favors by appearing on ''60 Minutes.''
 ''It was an act of total lunacy,'' said Jonathan Turley, professor of law at George Washington University. Because everything in the interview can be used as evidence, it could close the door on some lines of defense, he said.
 Mr. Turley said Ms. Dunn's best defense is ''rather obvious.''
 ''She's got to claim that she did not micromanage the investigation,'' he said. ''Her best defense must not be ignorance of the law, but ignorance of the act.''
 But he and other legal experts said Ms. Dunn and Mr. Hunsaker might have trouble making the case.
 Joel Reidenberg, professor of law and director of the center on law and information policy at Fordham University, said: ''Their best argument is to say, 'We didn't know what Wagner was doing'? Is it a credible argument? I don't think so. They got reports of detailed phone records.'' 
 Mr. Turley said he expected the challenges to be severe for Mr. Wagner as well, because the other defendants would seek to isolate him as the bad actor.
 ''He is someone we call the 'designated defendant,' '' Mr. Turley said. ''He'll be portrayed as the rogue employee or rogue contractor.''
 But that could work against the other defendants, too, he said. ''If prosecutors really want to nail the top executives, they could cut a deal with him.''
 Mr. Wagner's lawyer, Mr. Naratil, said he was still studying the statutes in the case but said one central question was whether the state of California has jurisdiction over his client, who lives in Littleton, Colo.
 Mr. Wagner is said to have been hired to gather phone records in the Hewlett-Packard investigation for Mr. DePante's firm, Action Research Group, based in Florida, which was hired in turn by Mr. DeLia, an investigative consultant in the Boston area. 
 Outside the courtroom on Tuesday, Mr. Naratil said Mr. Wagner ''didn't know anyone at H.P. and he didn't know he was working for H.P.''
 The lawyer representing Mr. DeLia in court on Tuesday, John Williams, declined to comment after the hearing. 
 Michael Pancer, the lawyer for Mr. Hunsaker, said he expected to be able to elaborate on his strategy after he got further into the pretrial procedures. For now, he said, his client's defense is based on a good-faith belief that the investigators' conduct was legal. 
 But Mr. Turley said Mr. Hunsaker could have a tough road, too, partly because of an e-mail message that the defendant is said to have written. In that message -- in response to a note from investigators saying that a ruse had been used to obtain phone records -- Mr. Hunsaker wrote back that he ''shouldn't have asked.''
 Mr. Turley said that, whatever the defense strategy, that message could become a cornerstone of the prosecutor's case. ''The quote supplies a ready-made narrative,'' Mr. Turley said. ''It sums up the case in a single sentence.'' 
 He said prosecutors would characterize a corporate culture in which top executives did not confront the hard questions, telling the jurors: ''Isn't that what Dunn is all about? She knew not to ask.''

HEADLINE: Union Disrupts Plan to Send Ailing Workers to India for Cheaper Medical Care 

BYLINE: By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, Carl Garrett, a 60-year-old North Carolina resident, was packing his bags to fly to New Delhi and check into the plush Indraprastha Apollo Hospital to have his gall bladder removed and the painful muscles in his left shoulder repaired. Mr. Garrett was to be a test case, the first company-sponsored worker in the United States to receive medical treatment in low-cost India.
 But instead of making the 20-hour flight, Mr. Garrett was grounded by a stormy debate between his employer, which saw the benefits of using the less expensive hospitals in India, and his union, which raised questions about the quality of overseas health care and the issue of medical liability should anything go wrong.
''I was looking forward to the adventure of being treated in India,'' Mr. Garrett said the other day. ''But my company dropped the ball.'' 
 The union, the United Steelworkers, stepped in after it heard about Mr. Garrett's plans, saying it deplored a ''shocking new approach'' of sending workers to low-cost countries as a way to cut health care costs. Its officials insisted that Mr. Garrett be offered a health care option within the United States. 
 ''No U.S. citizen should be exposed to the risks involved in traveling internationally for health care services,'' Leo W. Gerard, the president of the union, said in a recent letter to the Senate and House committees that oversee health care. He expressed his concern about the willingness of employers to offer incentives to employees to go overseas. 
 Mr. Garrett, who works for Blue Ridge Paper Products in Canton, N.C., had volunteered to get his treatments in India in return for a share in the company's savings. Blue Ridge now says it will find Mr. Garrett a treatment alternative in the United States and will offer the overseas option only to its salaried employees. 
 IndUShealth, a company based in North Carolina that arranges health care in India for Americans, would have made Mr. Garrett's medical arrangements. The company acknowledged that its plan to send Blue Ridge workers to India was ''on hold'' but said it was exploring deals with other employers. 
 The union's resistance has brought to the fore a critical question in the path of the globalization of the health care industry -- who is liable if something goes wrong in an overseas hospital? And underlying all this is the even more explosive issue of potential job losses in the American health care industry, in an economy already sensitive to the large-scale shift of jobs to cheaper overseas locations.
 Even as the debate continues about insurers' role in health care outsourcing, hundreds of uninsured and under-insured Americans have already gone on their own to India for treatments. 
 With medical costs in India routinely 80 percent lower than in the United States, experts predict that globally standardized health care delivered in countries like India and Thailand will eventually change the face of the health care business. 
 Providing health care to foreigners could generate $20 billion for India by 2012, according to a study by McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, although McKinsey did not say how many patients that figure represents. With 150,000 overseas patients last year -- though only a small fraction of them Americans -- India is already the global leader in importing foreign patients for low-cost treatment. Its best hospitals have Western-trained doctors and are equipped with modern equipment.
 Still, cross-border medical liability in countries like India could prove to be a major hurdle, the experts say. In the case of Mr. Garrett, Blue Ridge Paper asked him to sign a release saying that he was ''on his own as far as medical liability,'' said Bonnie Blackley, the benefits director at Blue Ridge. 
 Tom Keesling, president of IndUShealth, said ''the Indian physician and hospital would be directly responsible for any malpractice.'' 
 Zubin Daruwalla, health care analyst at the consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, said there was no uniform code in India on what could be considered medical negligence and what compensation ought to be paid. ''Compared with the huge payouts in the United States, Indian courts award small amounts,'' Mr. Daruwalla said. 
 So, as Mr. Daruwalla noted, in addition to traveling back and forth to India to fight a legal battle, an American patient might have to be content with a few thousand dollars of compensation in case of a problem.
 Employers have been trying to get their workers' health care costs under control, and the pressure to outsource health care is inevitable, said Aaditya Mattoo, an economist with the World Bank in Washington who specializes in global services trade.
 But United Steelworkers, the largest industrial union in North America with over 850,000 members, said it would fight any effort by American companies to send employees abroad for treatments. ''We are confident that we are in a position to block any employees being exported to India, Thailand or Mexico,'' said Stan Johnson, a spokesman. ''The ailing American health care system cannot be cured by sending patients abroad.''
 But Harpal Singh, chairman of Fortis Healthcare, a large New Delhi-based chain of hospitals, said American corporations would not be able to resist for long the lure of overseas hospitals offering first-world health care delivered at third-world costs.
 McKinsey has forecast that by 2008, top companies in the United States firms would spend as much on health care on average as they made in profits. As insurance costs become unaffordable, companies are scaling back or dropping health benefits.
 ''The health care opportunity has the potential to outshine outsourcing and deliver big advantages for both Indian and U.S. businesses,'' said Mr. Singh, who is also co-chairman of the Working Group on Healthcare, which was set up by two influential trade groups, the United States-India Business Council and Confederation of Indian Industry. 
 Fortis, Mr. Singh's company, runs a dozen hospitals in and around New Delhi, including a modern 250-bed cardiac hospital in neighboring Mohali where uninsured American patients represent a fifth of all patients. The chain plans to add 35 hospitals in the next five years. Many of these, and those run by rival hospital chains like Wockhardt and Apollo, will be built to the specifications of international hospital certification agencies. 
 To be sure, swarms of employer-sponsored patients are unlikely to descend on Delhi or Mumbai any time soon. Crowded airports, traffic-clogged streets, distressing poverty and a reputation for grime can put off even the average Western tourist, let alone a patient arriving for treatment.
 Mr. Johnson of United Steelworkers said Mr. Garrett had been saved from the hazards of international travel and being treated in an alien culture, in addition to the malpractice risk. ''Cost may be a downside but there are many upsides to his not going to India,'' he said.
 If there was an upside to staying home, Mr. Garrett said he could not see it. He was all set to go to India with his fiancee and then return in good health to marry her later this year. Instead, his treatment has been delayed and he is now left to pay high incidental expenses and a higher co-pay for his treatment in the United States. ''I've been left out in the cold,'' Mr. Garrett said.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Inventories Rose 1.1% In August, and Sales Kept Pace

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Inventories at wholesalers rose more than forecast in August, just enough to keep pace with an increase in sales and to suggest that factories will need to churn out more goods in coming months to meet demand. 
 The increase, 1.1 percent, was the biggest since April and came after a 0.9 percent gain in July, the Commerce Department said yesterday.
Economists expected inventories to rise 0.7 percent.
 Sales at wholesalers also rose 1.1 percent in August after a 0.5 percent gain in July.
 The amount of goods in warehouses stayed at a record low at the current sales rate.
 ''Outside of the automobile industry, inventories are pretty much in balance with demand,'' said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Conn. ''For as long as consumer demand holds up, we're expecting stronger rather than weaker production.''
 Richard Fisher, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said the effects of a slump in the housing market on the rest of the economy should not be exaggerated. 
 ''It's important not to overfixate on housing,'' Mr. Fisher said after a speech in London. ''The rest of the economy is running on all pistons.''
 Wholesalers account for about a fourth of all business inventories. Companies added to stockpiles at an annual rate of $53.7 billion in the second quarter after a $41.2 billion pace in the first three months of the year. Inventories added 0.44 percentage point to gross domestic product in the second quarter.
 The inventory-to-sales ratio, which measures how long inventories would last at the current sales pace, stayed at 1.15 months in August, the Commerce Department's report showed.
 The value of wholesale inventories rose in August to $386.6 billion, from $382.4 billion in July. Sales increased to $335.6 billion.
 Stockpiles of durable goods to wholesalers, including cars and computers, increased 0.9 percent for a second month in August. Sales of such goods, meant to last several years, jumped 1.4 percent, the most since May.
 Inventories of machinery, professional equipment and electrical goods increased in August. Sales of machines, electrical equipment and imported automobiles rose during the month.
 Inventories of nondurable goods increased 1.5 percent after a 0.8 percent rise. Sales of such goods were up 0.9 percent in August.

HEADLINE: Religion-Based Tax Breaks: Housing to Paychecks to Books

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES; Andrew Lehren and Donna Anderson contributed to this article.

 BODY:
For tens of millions of Americans, the Rev. Rick Warren is best known for his blockbuster spiritual guide, ''The Purpose Driven Life,'' which has sold more than 25 million copies; his success as the founder of the 22,000-member Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, Calif.; and his efforts on behalf of some of the world's neediest people.
 But for tens of thousands of ministers -- and their financial advisers -- Pastor Warren will also be remembered as their champion in a fight over the most valuable tax break available to ordained clergy members of all faiths: an exemption from federal taxes for most of the money they spend on housing, which typically represents roughly a third of their compensation. Pastor Warren argued that the tax break is essential to poorly paid clergy members who serve society.
The tax break is not available to the staff at secular nonprofit organizations whose scale and charitable aims compare to those of religious ministries like Pastor Warren's church, or to poorly paid inner-city teachers and day care workers who also serve their communities. 
 The housing deduction is one of several tax breaks that leave extra money in the pockets of clergy members and their religious employers. Ministers of every faith are also exempt from income tax withholding and can opt out of Social Security. And every state but one exempts religious employers from paying state unemployment taxes -- reducing the employers' payroll expenses but also leaving their workers without unemployment benefits if they are laid off.
 Another religion-based tax break -- the only one consistently defeated in the courts in recent years -- is an exemption from state sales taxes for religious publications but not for secular ones.
 This sales tax break has been struck down as unconstitutional in at least five states, most recently in Georgia in February, when a United States District Court judge, Richard W. Story, ruled that ''the unique and preferential treatment the state provides to 'religious' literature raises serious constitutional concerns'' under the First Amendment clause prohibiting an ''establishment'' of religion.
 Yet a few states still have a sales tax exemption for religious publications. One of them is Florida, where state officials, lawyers for two religious publications and a national religious liberty advocacy group have joined forces to defend the tax break from a constitutional challenge waged almost single-handedly by an Orlando lawyer named Heather Morcroft.
 Ms. Morcroft is a Legal Aid staff lawyer who works with foster children. She is a believer in Wicca, which she described as a neo-pagan faith loosely based on the traditions of ancient earth-centered religions, and serves as president of the state's small Wiccan Religious Cooperative.
 The cooperative is the formal plaintiff in the pending lawsuit Ms. Morcroft filed almost five years ago to challenge the constitutionality of the Florida exemption. Her arguments echo those that have prevailed in other states: that by exempting religious publications from the sales tax, the government is favoring religious ideas over secular ones, and that tax officials should not be in the business of deciding what publications are sufficiently religious to be exempt.
 In contrast to Ms. Morcroft's lonely fight in Tallahassee, Pastor Warren, who declined to be interviewed for this article, had a host of allies when he went to battle to defend the special tax deduction for housing expenses of clergy members. Ultimately, the allies included both houses of Congress and the president of the United States.

The Housing Exemption
 The one small passage in the vast federal tax code that originally conferred the housing-expense exemption on clergy members did not cap the deduction. But in 1971, the Internal Revenue Service limited it to the ''fair market rental value'' of the furnished home, utilities included.
 During a routine audit in 1996, according to court documents, the I.R.S. decided that Pastor Warren's housing deduction exceeded the rental value of his new home on Via Del Sol in the rugged Trabuco Canyon, southeast of Los Angeles.
 That's when the fireworks began.
 Pastor Warren, who gives 90 percent of his considerable income to charities, later explained in an open letter to other ministers that he decided to sue because the housing allowance was the only way small churches could pay their pastors enough to live -- and he knew that those ministers could not fight the I.R.S. as he could.
 The deduction, usually called the parsonage exemption, is available to ministers, rabbis and other clergy members of all faiths working at houses of worship. It allows them to live in congregation-owned housing without being taxed on the imputed value of their free housing, as almost all other employees are when they live in company-paid housing. 
 Since 1954, the provision had also shielded clergy members from taxes on the entire portion of their paycheck designated by their congregations as a housing allowance, whether they spent it on renting an apartment or buying their own home. But the rules the I.R.S. adopted in 1971 limited the deduction to the smallest of three amounts: the ''fair market rental value'' of the home, the housing allowance paid to the minister or the minister's actual housing expenses.
 That ruling lighted the long fuse that, decades later, propelled Pastor Warren into court.
 It took four years -- and far more of Pastor Warren's money than the $55,300 disputed in the audit -- but on May 16, 2000, the United States Tax Court struck down the I.R.S.'s cap and ruled that clergy members could deduct ''the amount used to provide a home,'' however much that might be.
 If the story had ended there, Pastor Warren's battle would have been an unequivocal victory for the clergy. But the I.R.S. appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. And in March 2002, that court raised an unexpected question: was this tax break constitutional? Or did it treat the clergy so favorably that it violated the First Amendment?
 The court appointed Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor then on the faculty at the University of Southern California, to research the constitutional issue and file a friend-of-the-court brief. The court was immediately pelted with defending arguments from lawyers representing almost every religious organization in the country, from the Central Conference of American Rabbis to the Church of the Nazarene.
 Some defenders noted that employees required to live in certain places for the convenience of their employer, as pastors are, had long been eligible for tax relief. (A similar exemption is available to some military and diplomatic personnel. But only clergy members can apply it so broadly -- for example, applying it even when they work for a church they themselves founded at a location of their own choosing, as was the case with Pastor Warren.)
 Others argued that tax deductions favoring religion had been granted for more than 200 years without any objections from the Supreme Court, and this one was no exception. And a few simply pleaded that clergy members deserved the deduction because they were so poorly paid for their contributions to society.
 Professor Chemerinsky studied the relevant First Amendment case law, especially the 1989 case Texas Monthly v. Bullock in which the Supreme Court had drawn the line at government's granting a ''tax break to those who spread the gospel that it does not also give to others.'' He urged the appeals court to find the tax break unconstitutional.
 Under I.R.S. rules, he noted, this benefit is available to all clergy members who administer sacraments, conduct worship and direct the spiritual life of a religious institution. ''The government thus has to determine what constitutes 'sacraments,' 'religious worship' and the 'spiritual life' of a religion and then to evaluate whether the clergy member is sufficiently engaged in these tasks,'' Professor Chemerinsky continued.
 ''It is difficult to imagine a greater entanglement with religion than this evaluation,'' he wrote in his brief for the court. 
 Moreover, ''the parsonage exemption is a subsidy for religion'' and is therefore unconstitutional, he argued. Current Congressional budget records show that the exemption has cost the government as much as $500 million in tax revenue a year, shifting that much of the national tax burden onto other taxpayers.
 He did not address the pastoral poverty argument in his court briefs, but in an interview, he noted that poorly paid inner-city teachers and day care workers do not benefit from the parsonage exemption, despite their service to society.
 Nor do people at secular nonprofit organizations engaged in humanitarian work. Action Against Hunger U.S.A., based in New York, finances relief programs in Africa, but its director, Cathy Skoula, pays taxes on her entire salary, including what she spends on housing. So does Lawrence Rosenblatt, executive director of the Bowery Residents' Committee, which provides food, shelter and counseling to sick, needy people in Lower Manhattan. 
 Even amid the distractions of the year after Sept. 11, the constitutional challenge to the clergy housing deduction inspired wide coverage in religious publications and some heated words on radio. Pastor Warren quoted comments made to him by a conservative radio commentator, Hugh Hewitt, who said the issue arose because of ''the implacable hostility of the political left to the role of God in the world and the country.''
 But in fact, the political left and right joined forces with ''almost miraculous'' speed to defuse this constitutional time bomb, according to Richard R. Hammar, a lawyer and accountant who edits the Church Law and Tax Report newsletter. Within 40 days, the Clergy Housing Clarification Act of 2002 had been approved unanimously in both houses of Congress and signed into law by President Bush.
 ''It was like the parting of the Red Sea,'' Mr. Hammar said.
 The new law, in Solomonic fashion, affirmed the unlimited deductions ministers like Pastor Warren had taken in the past, but imposed the I.R.S.'s ''fair market rental value'' restriction on deductions going forward. Satisfied, the tax service withdrew its appeal, ending the constitutional challenge in San Francisco.
 Ministers of every faith are also exempt from income tax withholding. And they can opt out of Social Security -- an exemption that Mr. Hammar said was probably widely abused. 
 Until 1968, clergy members were exempt from Social Security unless they joined voluntarily. Since then, they have been automatically covered -- but, unlike other citizens, they are allowed to drop out as conscientious objectors if they assert, by a certain point early in their ministry, that they have a religious opposition to receiving public welfare benefits. 
 ''Few people, outside of the Amish, could plausibly say that,'' said Mr. Hammar, an accountant who also has a law degree from Harvard and attended its divinity school.
 Yet his research shows that 3 of every 10 ministers in America have opted out of Social Security. ''The only conclusion is that the conscience-based objection is usually really a financial decision,'' he said.
 Because the exemption is irrevocable, why would so many ministers take such a drastic step? Clergy members are considered self-employed and therefore pay a 15.3 percent contribution to Social Security, Mr. Hammar explained. So young ministers on tight budgets sometimes decide, or are persuaded, to drop out and thereby give themselves a 15.3 percent raise.
 ''The vast majority of clergy who did opt out of Social Security never replaced it with another retirement scheme,'' he added.
 Several times since 1968, religious denominations have urged Congress to rescue these potentially destitute ministers. On three occasions in the last 20 years, most recently in 1999, Congress has done so, opening a two-year window during which ministers who ''irrevocably'' dropped Social Security could return.
 Mr. Hammar said federal law and the laws of every state except Oregon also exempt religious employers from the unemployment compensation laws that cover other employers. Court rulings widened this exemption to include religious-operated schools, he said, and in 1997 Congress expanded it further to include schools ''operated for a religious purpose'' but not actually controlled or affiliated with a religious denomination or institution.
 As a result, he said, state courts have generally determined that workers who are laid off from these exempt religious employers cannot collect jobless benefits.

Breaks on Sales Taxes
 In her 20 years as a lawyer, Heather Morcroft had never argued a case before the Florida Supreme Court.
 But there she was, on June 9 -- standing alone on her side of the lofty courtroom in Tallahassee to challenge the constitutionality of a Florida law that exempts ''religious publications'' from the state sales tax.
 As Ms. Morcroft sees it, this exemption not only infringes on the liberty of those faiths with writings that may not be deemed sufficiently religious to be exempt, but it also puts government in the role of defining a religious publication and then favoring that publication over secular ones.
 None of that, she says, should be allowed under the First Amendment, which provides, in part, that ''Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.''
 Indeed, in that 1989 case in Texas, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the government could ''not place its prestige, coercive authority, or resources behind a single religious faith or behind religious faith generally'' without violating the Constitution.
 Some legal scholars argue that there was no clear majority opinion, and hence no clear judicial guidance, in the Texas case. 
 But Ms. Morcroft noted in her lawsuit that since the Supreme Court decision in the Texas case, federal and state courts in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Carolina, as well as Georgia, had ''found that a sales tax exemption for items based on their religious content is unconstitutional.''
 Florida is one of several states that still have some sort of sales tax exemption for religious publications. 
 Lawyers defending the exemption, which costs the state just under $10 million each year, say it is consistent with a long list of laws, adopted and upheld since the nation's birth, that have benefited religion in some way. Governments ''have found it prudent to avoid entanglement of religion with the state taxation process by providing exemptions,'' argued Kevin Shaughnessy, a lawyer in the Orlando office of Baker & Hostetler who represents The Florida Baptist Witness and The Florida Catholic, which benefit from the exemption. Similar arguments were made by Liberty Counsel, a religious freedom advocacy group in Orlando.
 Most states give religious groups some sort of broad sales tax exemption, but most do so simply by including religious organizations in omnibus exemptions that cover sales to, and sometimes purchases from, nonprofit groups of all sorts. 
 But a few states go further, exempting specific kinds of religious publications from sales taxes no matter who buys or sells them, said John L. Mikesell, a professor at Indiana University and the co-author of a widely used primer on sales taxation. They include Florida, Massachusetts and Texas, which revised its statute after the Texas Monthly case.
 Several other states grant special treatment to sacramental equipment and supplies, and to materials a private contractor buys for use on many religious construction projects.
 The difficulty of applying these exemptions in real life was revealed in Tallahassee, when Justice Barbara J. Pariente quizzed James A. McKee, the state attorney defending the Florida statute, about how the state went about ''deciding whether my Bible is really a religious text, or if it is historical or something else.''
 Mr. McKee quickly assured her that the revenue department left those constitutionally sensitive ''content'' decisions to the booksellers. ''It's similar to a statute that exempts certain food items,'' he explained. ''The grocery store is actually the one that makes the determination.''
 Sounding a little shocked, Justice Pariente asked, ''So they can say anything is religious and there is no challenge to it?''
 Mr. McKee did not directly respond to her question -- but booksellers have.
 While there is no way of knowing how small bookshops decide what is an exempt ''religious publication,'' big national booksellers have developed definitions to guide their stores in Florida and other states with similar exemptions.
 The problem is, their definitions are different.
 Barnes & Noble recognizes a narrow category that includes the Bible and a short list of other ''sacred texts,'' including the Talmud and the Koran, according to Mary Ellen Keating, a company spokeswoman.
 At Borders, the exemption is broader, including books on theology and religious history as well as Bibles, hymnals, prayer books and the sacred texts of all religions, according to Anne Roman, a spokeswoman there. 
 Hearing that, Ms. Morcroft said she was not surprised at the disparities. ''I have friends who shop at a local Christian bookstore,'' she said. ''They say the only thing that's ever tax-exempt there is the Bible.''
 Like the many other tax and regulatory exemptions that have become available to religious organizations in America, the tax breaks for clergy housing expenses and religious publications benefit religion in ways that some critics say go beyond the limits of the Constitution.
 Until several years ago, ''it was inconceivable for most to think that religion might well be aggressively expanding its power in a way that is harmful to the public good,'' said Marci A. Hamilton, a law professor at the Cardozo law school at Yeshiva University in New York and the author of ''God vs. the Gavel: Religion and the Rule of Law,'' which is critical of many religious exemptions, particularly in the areas of land use and family law.
 But now, Professor Hamilton said, the power of religious entities ''is at its apex.'' 
 Defenders of these exemptions deny that they raise any questions of excessive power or constitutional violations. ''Government deregulation of religion is consistent with a broader pattern of American government going back to the founding,'' said Anthony R. Picarello Jr., vice president and general counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a legal advocacy group in Washington. 
 ''Providing special treatment is not always constitutionally required,'' he said, ''but it is constitutionally permissible.''

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about religion-based tax deductions misstated the financial impact for clergy members electing to opt out of Social Security, as they are allowed to do under federal law. Withdrawing from Social Security would result in a pay raise for the clergy member of 18.1 percent, not 15.3 percent.

HEADLINE: As Election Nears, Groups Plan Negative Ads

BYLINE: By JOHN BRODER; Aron Pilhofer and Kitty Bennett contributed research.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
A previously unknown group led by a Republican political consultant in Houston is financing television advertisements against nine Democratic House candidates from North Carolina to Arizona.
 The group, Americans for Honesty on Issues, is spending more than $1 million on the advertisements, which accuse Democratic candidates of carpetbagging, coddling illegal immigrants, being soft on crime and advocating cutting off money for troops in Iraq.
The television spots appear to be the first wave of a boatload of negative political advertising that will appear in the weeks before the Nov. 7 election. Many of the advertisements will be produced by independent organizations known as 527 groups, after the provision in the tax code that allows such groups to spend virtually unlimited sums on political activity as long as it is not formally coordinated with parties or candidates. 
 The 527 groups had raised nearly $200 million as of June 30, much of which appears to be available to be spent on pre-election activities. And if past trends hold, the total raised and spent by the groups on this election will surpass $300 million, eclipsing the $258 million spent by such groups in the last midterm election, in 2002.
 The increase is striking because the campaign finance law enacted in 2002 now forbids federal elected officials and candidates from operating their own 527 groups. In 2002, committees maintained by such officials raised about a third of the total dollars for the groups.
 The leader of Americans for Honesty on Issues is Sue Walden, a close ally of Tom DeLay, the former House majority leader who left Congress amid questions on ethics and fund-raising. Ms. Walden has also raised money for President Bush and served as an adviser to Kenneth L. Lay, the former chief executive of Enron who died in July.
 She referred a call seeking comment to Glenn M. Willard, a lawyer with Patton Boggs in Washington, who drew up the papers establishing the organization. Mr. Willard confirmed that Ms. Walden was the nominal head of the committee, but he declined to identify the group's donors or say how much it planned to spend.
 The group's Web site does not give an address or phone number, nor does it list any of the officers or sponsors. It says only, ''Americans for Honesty on Issues is organized to engage in political issue communications in compliance with federal and state laws.'' 
 Democrats, generously financed by labor unions and rich individuals like George Soros, dominated the 527 field in the presidential election of 2004, when such groups raised and spent more than $650 million. But Democratic groups have been relatively quiet this year, in part because big donors like Mr. Soros are giving much less money.
 One Democratic 527 group, Majority Action, announced this week that it would run advertisements in four Congressional districts criticizing incumbent Republican House members for voting against federal financing for stem cell research.
 The advertisements will focus on Representatives Chris Chocola of Indiana, Thelma Drake of Virginia, Don Sherwood of Pennsylvania and James T. Walsh of New York.
 Total spending on the 60-second advertisements will be about $500,000, said Bill Buck, spokesman for Majority Action. The group's founders include Joe Andrew and Don Fowler, former chairmen of the Democratic National Committee.
 Another Democratic 527 organization, the September Group, founded by the longtime party operative Harold M. Ickes, is planning a late burst of anti-Republican spending, said Howard Wolfson, a political consultant working with the group. But Mr. Wolfson would not say how much money the group had raised nor how it intended to spend it.
 Emily's List, which supports Democratic candidates at the state and federal level, reported raising $3 million and spending nearly $2 million from July through September. Among its major donors are Linda Pritzker, a member of the family that owns the Hyatt hotel chain; Alida Messinger, a Rockefeller; Lee Fikes, a Texas oilman; and Mr. Soros. 
 Among the most active Republican 527 groups is the Economic Freedom Fund, which was formed this year and received a $5 million contribution from Bob J. Perry, a major Bush donor and an underwriter of the Swift boat veterans group in 2004. The fund is running advertisements on behalf of Republican candidates in Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Oregon and West Virginia.

HEADLINE: Far From Big City, Hidden Toll of Homelessness

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: TRINIDAD, Colo. 

 BODY:
As the Bush administration promotes a widely praised multibillion-dollar effort to end chronic homelessness in cities like Washington and San Francisco, a growing outcry is rising from rural areas that worsening problems far away from urban centers are being overlooked.
 Rural homelessness has always taken a back seat to the more glaring problems in cities. Most studies estimate homeless people in small towns account for about 9 percent of the 600,000 or so homeless nationwide. But local officials and advocates for the homeless in small towns say that economic distress in recent years, including closing plants, failing farms, rising housing costs and other troubles, has left more people without homes and in greater need of help.
Real numbers are hard to come by because most rural areas, where homeless services often means ad-hoc help from church groups or volunteers, are far behind a parade of cities taking head counts. 
 ''We are concerned that the focus on chronic homelessness may have the unintended consequence of shifting services away from families and rural communities,'' said John Parvensky, executive director of the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, one of several groups pushing the federal government to turn more attention to rural areas. 
 Among the homeless here is John Lobato, who offered a tour of his surroundings -- the abandoned shuttle bus where he sometimes sleeps, the makeshift assortment of pallets, mattresses and blankets where he and other men pass time, often drinking, and the Purgatoire River, where he bathes. 
 Sometimes he takes his medicine for schizophrenia, Mr. Lobato said, sometimes not. Sometimes he sobers up for a while, but then the bottle calls.
 ''I know I need help,'' he said, before embarking on a search for a liquor fix at midday in this isolated town 180 miles south of Denver. ''But I don't know where to get it.''
 Until recently, many small towns like Trinidad coped with those who panhandled or set up makeshift encampments in the woods with what Lance Cheslock, director of La Puente, a shelter in Alamosa, near here, calls ''Greyhound therapy.'' They handed out bus tickets. 
 ''They just send them up to the cities and let them deal with the problem there,'' said Mr. Cheslock, among the advocates pushing for a new way to finance rural homeless programs.
 The growing visibility of the problem has made some towns reconsider that attitude and push for local solutions, although they can be expensive and difficult. 
 Rural homelessness ''doesn't get enough attention,'' said Philip Mangano, the executive director of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness and the Bush administration's chief coordinator of homeless services. But Mr. Mangano said the problem had been difficult to assess because rural communities by and large had not chronicled their problems with the data-heavy planning documents the Housing and Urban Development Department and other federal agencies demand.
 ''Like any profile of the homeless, there is a lot of anecdote and hearsay, but you need data and research to create policy,'' Mr. Mangano said.
 To confront the problem, he cited the examples of Washington and Michigan, where every county, many of them rural, has committed to writing a plan to end homelessness.
 Here in Trinidad, a former old West coal town of 9,000 near the eastern slopes of the Sangre de Cristo mountains, people have long struggled through hard times. The downtown is pockmarked with shuttered storefronts, but new cafes and galleries have opened as the town tries to refashion itself as an artists' colony.
 Interstate 25, dotted with motels of various quality and shopping centers, slices through Trinidad, leaving tidy Victorian homes rising on a hill on one side and modest ranches, several in disrepair, on the other. 
 Sandi Espinoza, who directs the Open Door Soup Kitchen, in space borrowed from a church, said the organization was serving more meals than ever -- families, veterans, men just released from prison and a wide assortment of people smelling of liquor before noon. Some 85 people come daily for lunch, double the number from a few years ago, Ms. Espinoza said. ''We need shelter here,'' said one wobbly man, who when asked where he sleeps, replied, ''down under the bridges.''
 There is no homeless shelter, only a few drug, alcohol or mental illness treatment programs for the indigent, and a loose group of church pastors, volunteers and other concerned citizens striving to look after people who have no home.
 ''Pastor helps me out,'' Mr. Lobato said. ''The soup kitchen helps me out and these guys'' -- he motioned to his disheveled companions -- ''help me, too.''
 A couple of weeks ago, officials here cheered the establishment of a ''transitional housing unit,'' a single-family home leased from the government for $1 a year where a displaced family can live for a year or so until they get back on their feet, the first such project started here. The organizers say several families, doubled up with relatives or friends, need a place like that. 
 There is nothing for the men living in the tents and shacks that have popped up behind the Wal-Mart. 
 To seek more stable solutions, a small group was recently formed. With guidance from Becky Vanderslice, an organizer with Housing Justice, a group based in Denver, they gathered around a church conference table and discussed problems that included the need for rehabilitation programs and families unable to make ends meet. 
 Finally, said Cary T. Nelson, pastor at First Christian Church, the group decided to start with the single-family home. Churches and volunteers will subsidize the costs of running the house, a foreclosed property held by the local office of the federal Agriculture Department.
 They called the house Haven of Hope and have begun searching for a family to occupy it. One applicant, Brenda Holguin, said she hoped to move in with at least two of her four children, who are living with her estranged husband. A domestic dispute has left her homeless, living in a nearby domestic violence shelter, and such a house would help set her on a steady path, Ms. Holguin said. ''Having a house, my family in one place, would give me more self-esteem,'' she said. 
 Ms. Espinoza, who runs the soup kitchen, said she was hoping that local businesses or churches would step forward with donated space for an emergency shelter. 
 The National Coalition on Homelessness, an advocacy group, is considering mounting an effort to make the Agriculture Department, with its many field offices and staff members in rural areas, the lead agency for financing homeless programs outside urban areas. The task currently falls to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
 ''It should be the department of housing and urban-only development,'' said Michael Stoops, the executive director of the coalition. ''We should not give up on HUD, but we need to get other federal agencies involved.'' Last year, he said, HUD provided $120 million for 700 projects in rural areas, an amount that federal officials say has remained constant for several years. This year, the federal government has increased direct spending on homeless programs to about $4 billion, up from $2.9 billion and double the spending of five years ago. About 10 percent of that has gone toward a new focus on ending chronic homelessness, Mr. Mangano said. 
 The approach has fired up hope in Denver, San Francisco, Washington and other cities that headway is being made, but it has dismayed advocates in rural areas, where grant-writing expertise and the Talmudic knowledge of federal regulations are lacking.
 Small towns also lack the network of nonprofit organizations and corporations that often underwrite efforts.
 ''The government wants matching funds and the big city funders only fund the big cities,'' said Donna Haddow, a member of the Trinidad-Las Animas County Economic Development Board. ''There's nothing left by the time we come knocking.''
 Ms. Vanderslice of Housing Justice said a prominent foundation would not finance the new housing program in Trinidad because it had decided to focus most of its resources on Denver.
 ''There is a lot of money to end homelessness in the state,'' she said. ''But a lot is going to the Denver metro area because the mayor there has a 10-year plan.''
 Here, she added, ''they are going on open faith.''

HEADLINE: The Bus Is Waiting

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
As eras go, the post-cold war has been a pretty good one. The collapse of communism, the spread of free-market democracies and the general reign of stability bought and paid for by U.S. power all combined to create a world in which China and India have been able to rise peacefully, America has prospered, and Europe has become whole and free. Yes, there's been 9/11, Bosnia, the rise of the petro-dictators and African wars -- which are hardly trivial. But all in all, compared with the vast repression and nuclear standoff that characterized the cold war, the post-cold-war era has been much better for a lot of humanity.
 Too bad it's probably over. 
Yes, one day historians may argue that the post-cold war started on 11/9 and ended on 10/9. 
 The Berlin Wall fell on 11/9 -- Nov. 9, 1989, which ushered in the post-cold-war world. The apparent North Korean nuclear test went up on Oct. 9, 2006, which, may have ushered out the post-cold-war world and ushered in a much more problematic era -- the post-post-cold-war world.
 This post-post-cold-war era will be defined by three new features -- if things continue as they are. First is a nuclear Asia, triggered by North Korea's flaunting of its nuclear weapons. How long will Japan, Taiwan and South Korea remain nonnuclear with Kim Jong-il brandishing his bomb? Second is a nuclear Middle East. Iran is almost certain to follow North Korea's lead, and once the Shiite Persians in Iran have the bomb, how long will it be before the Sunni Arabs in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, even Syria have one too? Third is a disintegrating Iraq in the heart of the Arab world, with its destabilizing impact on oil prices and terrorism.
 Together these will add up to a much more dangerous and volatile post-post-cold-war world -- unless 
 Unless, what? Unless China and Russia get their act together and understand that the post-post-cold-war world is a much bigger threat to their prosperity than a post-cold-war world in which U.S. power is pre-eminent. You read me right -- the post-cold-war world can be preserved only if Russia and China get over their ambivalence about U.S. power and if the Bush team gets over its ambivalence about Iran and North Korea.
 How so? The U.S. is sanctioned out when it comes to Iran and North Korea. We don't have any more unilateral sanctions with which to pressure either regime to halt its nuclear adventure. The only countries that could have an impact on North Korea and Iran are China and Russia. 
 If China told North Korea that unless it dismantled its nuclear program and put its facilities under U.N. inspection, Beijing would cut off its energy and food, Kim Jong-il would relent. He is not suicidal. Anything less than such an explicit Chinese threat will mean a nuclear North Korea and eventually a nuclear Asia -- which will certainly not be good for China's growth prospects. 
 And if China and Russia told Iran that they would join in the toughest possible U.N. economic sanctions on Tehran if it persisted in its nuclear program, the ayatollahs would also back down. Because then the Europeans would have the spine to join in sanctions and Tehran would face a united front.
 To be sure, both moves would be greatly helped by a declaration from the Bush team that it had overcome its infighting and decided to pursue changes in behavior instead of changes in regimes in North Korea and Iran, and would be prepared to give explicit security guarantees to both if they verifiably ended their nuclear programs. When an administration can't make up its mind between regime change and change of behavior, it gets neither. And that is what the Bush team has gotten.
 So, thanks to North Korea's nuclear test, we've come to a moment of truth. Yes, we have to make up our minds, but so, too, must Moscow and Beijing. They constantly advocate ''multilateral'' solutions. Well, will they sign up for the kind of biting multilateral sanctions that would work vis-a-vis Iran and North Korea and make ''unilateral'' U.S. military options unnecessary? If Russia and China want to see the post-cold-war world continue, they can't be free riders anymore -- opposing both U.S. unilateralism and effective multilateralism that requires them to do something hard. They've got to start paying a price to preserve this world. 
 If they do, this relatively benign post-cold-war world might continue. If they don't, if they keep trying to be free riders on our bus, we'll all stall -- because America can't keep this bus moving alone any longer, especially when the road gets this dangerous. 
 The bus stops here.

HEADLINE: Seaside Living

BYLINE: By SHELLEY EMLING

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Malcolm Freeland cannot say enough about the benefits of coastal living.
 He has had a home on the water's edge in South Devon, near the pretty sailing resort of Salcombe, England, since 1972. He described his seven acres, which includes his own beach and a jetty for his 38-foot sailing boat, as ''simply beautiful.''
 ''We raised five children here and certainly they enjoyed growing up along the water,'' he said. ''We moved here for the coastal lifestyle and we've stayed because of this lifestyle.'' And, since telecommunications has improved, Mr. Freeland also has had another benefit: He has been able to continue his career as an engineer from home. 
 Indeed, coastal regions of Britain like Devon are drawing a growing number of professionals who are not required to work in specific locations.
 And Britons in general are finding it harder to resist life by the seaside, and they are willing to pay a premium for the pleasure.
 The growing demand for homes along Britain's coast has meant rising prices.. ''In my area houses usually sell before they are even advertised so it's definitely a hot property market,'' Mr. Freeland said.
 A recent real estate survey by Halifax Estate Agents showed that house prices in more than half of Britain's seaside towns have soared by at least 50 percent over the past three years, with most communities recording jumps that have far exceeded the 31 percent average increase in house prices across the rest of the country.
 Seaham, in the northeastern county of Durham, is the country's best performer over the past three years, with average house prices increasing by 172 percent to $:117,266, or nearly $200,000.
 Much of the improvement in this former coal-mining town on the North Sea coast is credited to a major injection of money from the government and the European Union, part of which financed a number of residential projects.
 Across the country, ''firm demand for second homes has clearly been a factor pushing up prices near the sea but regeneration efforts in seaside towns have also been a positive for prices,'' said Colin Kemp, managing director at Halifax Estate Agents, which completed its annual seaside town review over the summer.
 The surge also has been powered by retirees and families eager to find spacious Victorian and Edwardian homes at reasonable prices, a rare find in almost any British city these days. It is not surprising that Dorset is one of the most expensive seaside counties, with an average home price of more than $:222,853 -- or about $400,000. 
 For one thing, its 95-mile coastline has been given Natural World Heritage Status by the United Nations, placing it in a league with the Grand Canyon in Arizona and the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Each year, millions of tourists visit the fossil-rich beaches of Dorset's Lyme Regis, a hilly town of pretty white Georgian homes mixed with a smattering of thatched-roof cottages. ''Dorset is a location which has grown enormously in popularity in the last decade as people have become happier to commute further and further from London,'' said Liam Bailey, head of residential research for the Knight Frank estate agency.
 ''This is so much more practical as an increasing number of people enjoy the option of working from home part of the week,'' he said.
 But Mr. Bailey warned about the limited number of available properties, noting that the supply is now 20 percent smaller than it was last year. One example is Sandbanks, a town near Bournemouth that was all but a shantytown until the 1960's and is now called ''Monte Carloby the Sea'' by the locals. Homes in the town, known for its quiet streets and white beaches, now top $:500,000, or nearly $1 million. 
 ''High demand and short supply in a very concentrated area make the prices high,'' said Simon Milledge, a waterside properties specialist at The Buying Solution, a search agency that finds homes for wealthy buyers. ''The south coast economy is strong and entrepreneurs like the idea of moving to Sandbanks.''
 Part of the town's appeal may be its celebrity cachet. Many well-known British soccer stars have moved to Sandbanks and even the British actor Hugh Grant and his girlfriend, Jemima Khan, recently were reported to have viewed properties nearby.
 Sandbanks also has flown the European Blue Flag, an award for the cleanest beaches, for 17 consecutive years, longer than any other coastal area in Britain.
 Eight of Britain's 10 most expensive seaside towns are on the country's west coast -- four in Cornwall; three, including Sandbanks, in Dorset; and two in Devon.
 A survey earlier this year by The Sunday Times of London found that properties with boat moorings are typically 30 percent more expensive than identical properties inland. Top-quality homes without moorings, but with uninterrupted water views, are on average 25 percent more expensive, while properties within modern marinas, along lakes or on the banks of canals command 15 percent to 25 percent more.
 Yet property hunters still can find good value in some coastal communities, property experts say. According to the Halifax review, there are 14 seaside towns where homes sell for an average of less than $:100,000 pounds, or about $185,000.
 Britain's most affordable town is Wick in Scotland, where prices average $:64,612 pounds, or about $100,000. In general, Mr. Milledge said, the people seeking coastal properties are searching for a better quality of life -- and, for those looking along the southern coast, one that is only a two-and-a-half-hour drive from London.
 ''They are coming for the landscape, the peace and quiet and the seemingly slower pace of life,'' he said.

Malcolm Freeland cannot say enough about the benefits of coastal living.
 He has had a home on the water's edge in South Devon, near the pretty sailing resort of Salcombe, England, since 1972. He described his seven acres, which includes his own beach and a jetty for his 38-foot sailing boat, as ''simply beautiful.''
 ''We raised five children here and certainly they enjoyed growing up along the water,'' he said. ''We moved here for the coastal lifestyle and we've stayed because of this lifestyle.'' And, since telecommunications has improved, Mr. Freeland also has had another benefit: He has been able to continue his career as an engineer from home. 
 Indeed, coastal regions of Britain like Devon are drawing a growing number of professionals who are not required to work in specific locations.
 And Britons in general are finding it harder to resist life by the seaside, and they are willing to pay a premium for the pleasure.
 The growing demand for homes along Britain's coast has meant rising prices.. ''In my area houses usually sell before they are even advertised so it's definitely a hot property market,'' Mr. Freeland said.
 A recent real estate survey by Halifax Estate Agents showed that house prices in more than half of Britain's seaside towns have soared by at least 50 percent over the past three years, with most communities recording jumps that have far exceeded the 31 percent average increase in house prices across the rest of the country.
 Seaham, in the northeastern county of Durham, is the country's best performer over the past three years, with average house prices increasing by 172 percent to $:117,266, or nearly $200,000.
 Much of the improvement in this former coal-mining town on the North Sea coast is credited to a major injection of money from the government and the European Union, part of which financed a number of residential projects.
 Across the country, ''firm demand for second homes has clearly been a factor pushing up prices near the sea but regeneration efforts in seaside towns have also been a positive for prices,'' said Colin Kemp, managing director at Halifax Estate Agents, which completed its annual seaside town review over the summer.
 The surge also has been powered by retirees and families eager to find spacious Victorian and Edwardian homes at reasonable prices, a rare find in almost any British city these days. It is not surprising that Dorset is one of the most expensive seaside counties, with an average home price of more than $:222,853 -- or about $400,000. 
 For one thing, its 95-mile coastline has been given Natural World Heritage Status by the United Nations, placing it in a league with the Grand Canyon in Arizona and the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Each year, millions of tourists visit the fossil-rich beaches of Dorset's Lyme Regis, a hilly town of pretty white Georgian homes mixed with a smattering of thatched-roof cottages. ''Dorset is a location which has grown enormously in popularity in the last decade as people have become happier to commute further and further from London,'' said Liam Bailey, head of residential research for the Knight Frank estate agency.
 ''This is so much more practical as an increasing number of people enjoy the option of working from home part of the week,'' he said.
 But Mr. Bailey warned about the limited number of available properties, noting that the supply is now 20 percent smaller than it was last year. One example is Sandbanks, a town near Bournemouth that was all but a shantytown until the 1960's and is now called ''Monte Carloby the Sea'' by the locals. Homes in the town, known for its quiet streets and white beaches, now top $:500,000, or nearly $1 million. 
 ''High demand and short supply in a very concentrated area make the prices high,'' said Simon Milledge, a waterside properties specialist at The Buying Solution, a search agency that finds homes for wealthy buyers. ''The south coast economy is strong and entrepreneurs like the idea of moving to Sandbanks.''
 Part of the town's appeal may be its celebrity cachet. Many well-known British soccer stars have moved to Sandbanks and even the British actor Hugh Grant and his girlfriend, Jemima Khan, recently were reported to have viewed properties nearby.
 Sandbanks also has flown the European Blue Flag, an award for the cleanest beaches, for 17 consecutive years, longer than any other coastal area in Britain.
 Eight of Britain's 10 most expensive seaside towns are on the country's west coast -- four in Cornwall; three, including Sandbanks, in Dorset; and two in Devon.
 A survey earlier this year by The Sunday Times of London found that properties with boat moorings are typically 30 percent more expensive than identical properties inland. Top-quality homes without moorings, but with uninterrupted water views, are on average 25 percent more expensive, while properties within modern marinas, along lakes or on the banks of canals command 15 percent to 25 percent more.
 Yet property hunters still can find good value in some coastal communities, property experts say. According to the Halifax review, there are 14 seaside towns where homes sell for an average of less than $:100,000 pounds, or about $185,000.
 Britain's most affordable town is Wick in Scotland, where prices average $:64,612 pounds, or about $100,000. In general, Mr. Milledge said, the people seeking coastal properties are searching for a better quality of life -- and, for those looking along the southern coast, one that is only a two-and-a-half-hour drive from London.
 ''They are coming for the landscape, the peace and quiet and the seemingly slower pace of life,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Word of Test Confirms Stances in 2 Nations

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI and MARTIN FACKLER; Norimitsu Onishi reported from Seoul, and Martin Fackler from Tokyo.

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
In the suburbs north of here, the thaw between the Koreas has led South Korea to dismantle highway barricades meant to slow down an invasion of North Korean tanks. Japan, meanwhile, has begun investing billions of dollars in erecting a high-tech shield against North Korean missiles.
 South Korea and Japan, America's two major allies in this region, have grown increasingly apart in their attitudes and policies toward North Korea, even though President Roh Moo-hyun said Monday that the North's announcement of a nuclear test had put him on the same page as Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe. 
 Still, despite the gravity of a reported nuclear test, the calculations and interests that have led each country on its respective path have changed little. What's more, random interviews with South Koreans and Japanese on Tuesday suggested that the test, rather than changing public opinion, has merely reinforced it.
 South Koreans interviewed, while expressing anger and disappointment, said they did not support the economic sanctions and other punitive measures sought by the United States and Japan, but called for continuing to engage the North, though with more sticks. Japanese were decisively hawkish.
 ''The North Koreans are so greedy,'' said Moon Won-tae, 69, who like most South Koreans of his generation was once fiercely anti-Communist. ''They want more and more from us. They keep transferring the aid we give them into weapons.''
 Mr. Moon was chatting on a street corner with Jung Soon-ni, 74, who blurted out, ''Why does our government keep supporting North Korea?''
 But when pressed, both men said they still backed the engagement policy, though with a firmer hand than Mr. Roh's and more concessions from North Korea. ''Putting a stop to engagement also creates problems,'' Mr. Moon said, adding that he considered South and North Koreans to be one people.
 A 28-year-old mother, Bae Soo-jung, walking in downtown Seoul with her daughter and mother-in-law, said word of the test had made her feel ''nervous.'' But she was even more nervous about isolating the North even further.
 ''If we impose economic sanctions,'' she said, ''that will push North Korea to the edge. We need to keep engaging it.''
 In Japan, people interviewed agreed that the country should take a firmer stance, both in punishing North Korea and in strengthening its own military. While all said that Japan should maintain its defense alliance with the United States, their comments showed that many here now accept a level of rearming that would have been considered radical just a decade ago.
 ''Of course there should be economic sanctions,'' said Shoko Fukuzawa, a 61-year-old hairdresser shopping in downtown Tokyo. ''Whatever Japan can do, it should do.''
 And that includes rearming, she added. ''Every country is building its defenses. But we don't need nuclear weapons.''
 Mr. Abe affirmed to a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that Tokyo had ''no intention'' of possessing nuclear weapons.
 Public opinion toward North Korea has been crafted, in great part, by the governments in Seoul and Tokyo.
 In South Korea, decades of cold war confrontation gave way in the late 1990's to the ''sunshine policy'' of former President Kim Dae-jung, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his work on a rapprochement with the North.
 Lim Doo-hyuk, 24, a college student at Kwangwun University here, said that in elementary school, he once won a prize for writing the best anti-North propaganda: ''Be careful of North Korea all the time -- while awake and asleep.''
 But by high school, with the sunshine policy, North Koreans were no longer regarded as enemies. ''My teachers began teaching me that they were our brothers and we should live with them,'' Mr. Lim said. ''So people of my generation, including myself, have a positive image of North Korea.
 ''Roh Moo-hyun has been too weak -- he keeps giving to the North but receives nothing. Engagement shouldn't be unilateral. But we should have an effective engagement policy.''
 Until about 1997, most Japanese had little interest in North Korea, which at the time appeared to be a quirky but harmless neighbor. Japan's North Korea policy was largely controlled by pro-North Korea Japanese of Korean descent, who were originally brought to Japan as forced laborers and maintained strong ties of identity with their homeland. 
 In the late 1990's, public attitudes started to harden, as major news media and politicians began to take more seriously claims that dozens of Japanese missing since the late 1970's had actually been abducted by North Korean spies. The image of North Korea as an unpredictable threat was reinforced in 1998 when it test-launched a Taepodong missile over Japan.
 But the big turning point came in 2002, when North Korea admitted to abducting citizens and returned five survivors. The image of agents snatching people from Japanese shores turned public opinion decisively against North Korea, analysts said, even more so than missiles or Monday's reported nuclear test.
 ''The abduction issue is much bigger in Japan than the nuclear issue,'' said Masao Okonogi, the dean of the law faculty and a specialist on Korean politics at Keio University in Tokyo. ''It forms the basis of Japan's current view of North Korea.''
 The issue was also seized by Liberal Democrat hard-liners, led by Mr. Abe, who rose to political stardom by advocating a tough line on North Korea. They brandished the perceived North Korean threat to argue for long-cherished conservative goals, including revising the American-imposed peace Constitution and remaking Japan's defense forces into a full-fledged military.
 ''At this point, I think Abe is good,'' said Eiji Noguchi, 33, an office worker in Tokyo. ''The firm stance toward North Korea is good.''
 Mr. Okonogi said Japan and South Korea's perceptions of the North would keep heading in opposite directions, adding, ''And the gap will just keep growing after this nuclear test.''

HEADLINE: RICE ASSERTS U.S. PLANS NO ATTACK ON NORTH KOREA

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and WARREN HOGE; Thom Shanker reported from Washington and Warren Hoge from the United Nations. Steven R. Weisman, David E. Sanger and Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Tuesday that the United States did not intend to invade or attack North Korea, but she warned the North's leaders that they now risked sanctions ''unlike anything that they have faced before.''
 Even China, North Korea's most important ally, said Tuesday that tough measures were in order, though its representatives said the punishments might not necessarily be the harsh ones that Washington was proposing.
''For China, we need to have a firm, constructive, appropriate, but prudent, response,'' said Wang Guangya, the country's ambassador to the United Nations. ''There have to be some punitive actions, but also I think these actions have to be appropriate.''
 The United States, Britain and France all want a resolution drafted under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, which makes sanctions mandatory and poses the possibility of military enforcement. 
 While both China and Russia have spoken of the importance of taking serious action against North Korea's reported nuclear test, they are traditionally against invoking Chapter VII and have not indicated whether they would end their opposition. 
 The United States wants agreement on sanctions this week. But even as the administration sought to push tough language into a Security Council resolution, the White House expressed doubts about the capacity of North Korea's nuclear program, based on evidence that the reported test had a smaller yield than expected. [Page A8.] 
 Sanctions sought by the United States include international inspections of all cargo moving in and out of North Korea to detect weapons-related material. But that might prove difficult for China and Russia to accept, in part because their coastlines and borders would be affected. 
 The diplomatic moves came a day after administration officials responded with shock and outrage to an official announcement from North Korea that it had detonated a nuclear device. 
 In an interview on CNN, one of a series of television appearances, Secretary Rice stressed that ''the diplomatic path is open'' for the North, and that giving up its nuclear program would ''lead to all kinds of benefits for North Korea.'' 
 But she said the North's decision to pursue its nuclear program meant that it would face ''international condemnation and international sanctions unlike anything that they have faced before.''
 The United States has imposed economic curbs on North Korea since the opening of the Korean War in 1950, though President Clinton lifted a few of them toward the end of his time in office, when relations seemed to be thawing. 
 Now, in its bid to tighten sanctions, Bush administration officials say, the United States is pursuing a two-track approach: trying at the United Nations to persuade other countries to cut off economic ties with the North, and using American banking laws to punish banks overseas that deal with North Korean companies.
 At the United Nations on Tuesday, Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, plus Japan, met twice to work out differences on the sanctions proposed Monday by the United States. John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, reported the group was making headway and would meet again Wednesday.
 ''I think there is convergence on many issues, more than I would have predicted perhaps a day or two ago,'' Mr. Bolton said. ''That's not to say we're there by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm pleased by the positive nature of the discussions and look forward to more progress tomorrow.''
 Mr. Bolton said he had discussed the proposal for North Korean ports separately with Mr. Wang, the Chinese envoy.
 As for Russia, Mr. Bolton began the day complaining that Vitaly I. Churkin, the country's ambassador, had arrived at the morning session with no instructions from his government. He said it had left ''a hole'' in the conversations.
 But after the afternoon session, he said Mr. Churkin had heard from Moscow and was able to take part in the debate. ''We'll have some areas to discuss there and he raised some issues we had not thought of entirely, but by and large his comments were supportive,'' Mr. Bolton said.
 Mr. Churkin left without making any comment.
 Mr. Bolton declined to discuss specifics of the talks but said one amendment suggested by Japan -- a ban on travel by members of the North Korean government -- had attracted particular support.
 Asked if he would limit the American demands in the interests of speeding the process of drafting a resolution, he said: ''We want firmness and swiftness, and I think we can have both. That's our objective.''
 In television interviews and briefings for reporters, Secretary Rice and other officials reiterated past assurances that the United States was not moving toward occupying North Korea or toppling its government. 
 She said the administration's policy was still that the diplomatic path would be multilateral, through the stalled six-party talks, and not the two-way dialogue that North Korea has sought with the United States.
 But even as the administration sought to unify its international allies, there were signs of fissures among Republicans over whether Washington should negotiate directly with North Korea. 
 Representative Heather Wilson, a New Mexico Republican and former Air Force officer who has played a leading role on national security issues, advocated bilateral negotiations, within the context of the six-party talks. ''The idea here is to open a path for this rogue regime to walk back from the edge of the ledge,'' she said. ''I don't think there's anything wrong with straight, tough talk with countries that are not our friends.''
 In the administration's quest for tough sanctions, much of the effort is focused on China, Japan and especially South Korea, which supply most of North Korea's imports and investments. Indeed, South Korea has invested heavily in the Kaesong Industrial Park, an economic enclave in the North that employs thousands in factories that produce shoes, cosmetics and other export goods.
 The United States has tried, without much success, to get South Korea to limit its involvement in the enclave, arguing that North Korean financial institutions that are involved in it are also involved in illicit activities. In the wake of North Korea's latest nuclear steps, persuading South Korea may be easier, American officials say.
 The unilateral drive by the United States is likely to expand on existing efforts that American officials maintain have already had a damaging effect on North. Indeed, the sanctions may have propelled North Korea to walk away from negotiations on its nuclear program and test a weapon, some experts say.
 Now, with the enactment of American laws and executive orders after Sept. 11, 2001, new tools have become available, and they are likely to be expanded in coming weeks.
 Under the U.S.A. Patriot Act, signed into law shortly after the 2001 attacks, the United States labeled a bank in Macao, Banco Delta Asia, as a ''primary money-laundering concern'' and declared that any bank doing business on American soil -- virtually every big bank in the world -- could not do business with it.
 Administration officials say the ban on Banco Delta Asia badly disrupted North Korean activities, effectively froze the personal accounts of North Korean leaders and sent a message throughout the international financial system that the United States was prepared to do more.
 Backing up that threat, President Bush has accused several North Korean trading corporations of being involved in nuclear proliferation and missile activities, often in conjunction with Syria, Iran and Pakistan. American officials have also visited banks in Europe, Asia and the Middle East to tell them that dealings with those entities could jeopardize ties with American banks.
 The aim, according to Stuart Levey, under secretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, is to put the international community ''on notice about a particular threat'' and get them to voluntarily end their dealings with North Korean entities.

HEADLINE: Investing in the Poor

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert's Oct. 9 column, ''Cash With a Catch,'' rightly gives Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg credit for trying to alleviate poverty in New York City. But the mayor needs to take a more fundamental step than ''conditional cash transfers,'' as important as that experiment might be. 
 In his Commission on Economic Opportunity, it stated that ''work must pay'' and that ''the challenge today is that many families work hard but remain poor.'' This ''working poor'' dilemma, according to the commission, is rooted in ''an ever-widening skills gap and stubborn wage stagnation'' that ''require strategic approaches to raise the living standards of low-wage workers.''
The city can take a big step in addressing the low-wage problem. The city is providing substantial subsidies to large development projects on the West Side and elsewhere in the city. It should require that developers benefiting from these subsidies ensure that all service jobs in these developments will pay above-poverty wages and benefits. 
 Also, the city should invest in expanded skill-training efforts and work with the private sector to raise the skills and wages of low-wage workers through career advancement programs.

HEADLINE: U.S. Group Reaches Deal to Provide Laptops to All Libyan Schoolchildren

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
The government of Libya reached an agreement on Tuesday with One Laptop Per Child, a nonprofit United States group developing an inexpensive, educational laptop computer, with the goal of supplying machines to all 1.2 million Libyan schoolchildren by June 2008.
 The project, which is intended to supply computers broadly to children in developing nations, was conceived in 2005 by a computer researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Nicholas Negroponte. His goal is to design a wireless-connected laptop that will cost about $100 after the machines go into mass production next year. 
To date, Mr. Negroponte, the brother of the United States intelligence director, John D. Negroponte, has reached tentative purchase agreements with Brazil, Argentina, Nigeria and Thailand, and has struck a manufacturing deal with Quanta Computer Inc., a Taiwanese computer maker.
 Mr. Negroponte, who was in Tripoli this week to meet with Libyan officials, said he discussed the project extensively with the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, in August.
 ''When I met with Qaddafi, it had all the mystique and trimmings expected: middle of the desert, in a tent, 50 degrees C. etc.,'' Mr. Negroponte, who was traveling to Asia on Tuesday, wrote in an e-mail message. ''It took him very little time to find O.L.P.C. appealing as an idea.''
 The idea appealed to the Libyan leader, according to Mr. Negroponte, because it fit into his political agenda of creating a more open Libya and becoming an African leader. The two men also discussed the possibility of Libya's financing the purchase of laptops for a group of poorer African nations like Chad, Niger and Rwanda.
 It is possible, Mr. Negroponte said, that Libya will become the first nation in the world where all school-age children are connected to the Internet through educational computers. ''The U.S. and Singapore are not even close,'' he said.
 To date, One Laptop Per Child has received mixed support from the American computer industry. Test units currently use a low-power microprocessor manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices. However, both Intel and Microsoft have been publicly skeptical about the idea and have proposed competing low-cost educational computer projects. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, suggested that the next generation of cellphones might be a better way to reach across the so-called digital divide.
 Mr. Negroponte said Microsoft refused to sell its Windows software to the project at a price that would make it possible to include in his system. As a result, his laptops will come with the freely available Linux operating system, which is becoming increasingly popular in the developing world.
 The idea of a laptop for every schoolchild grew out of Mr. Negroponte's experience in giving children Internet-connected laptops in rural Cambodia. He said the first English word out of the mouths of the Cambodian students was ''Google.''
 Discussions between the One Laptop project and the Libyan government began as part of work being done by the Monitor Group, an international consulting firm co-founded by the economist Michael E. Porter. It is now helping the Libyans develop a national economic plan.
 Diplomatic relations between the United States and Libya have warmed recently, since Tripoli settled the Pan Am 103 bombing case and agreed to renounce its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Washington lifted a trade embargo two years ago, and the State Department rescinded Libya's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism last June.
 For its $250 million investment, Libya will receive 1.2 million computers, one server per school, a team of technical advisers to help set up the system, satellite internet service and other infrastructure.
 The first test models will be distributed to the five participating countries companies at the end of this November, according to Mr. Negroponte, and mass production is planned for June or July of 2007.
 The computers come with a wireless connection, a built-in video camera, an eight-hour battery and a hand crank for recharging batteries. They will initially be priced below $150, and the price is expected to decline when they are manufactured in large numbers.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about an agreement by Libya to supply its schoolchildren with laptop computers developed by One Laptop Per Child, a nonprofit American group, misstated the reason given by the group's chairman, Nicholas Negroponte, for why the machines will use the freely available Linux operating system instead of Windows software from the Microsoft Corporation. Mr. Negroponte said the group could not reach an agreement with Microsoft over licensing terms, not over price.

HEADLINE: Low-Sulfur Diesel Fuel Is Reaching Market

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
The biggest revolution in highway fuels since lead was removed from gasoline will be nearly complete on Sunday as a vast majority of trucks and buses will be able to fill their tanks with diesel fuel with just 3 percent of the sulfur content in the older fuel.
 Like lead, sulfur generates air pollution that leads to severe health consequences. Like lead, it also gums up the works of fine-tuned pollution control devices, making it exceedingly difficult to produce cleaner-burning engines. 
So the new fuel will pave the way for new generations of diesel engines that experts say will eventually cut lethal particulate pollution from diesel tailpipes an estimated 95 percent.
 On Tuesday, the Bush administration embraced this signal accomplishment as its own, ignoring the origins of the underlying regulation in the 1990's and the fact that it became effective in December 2000, before President Bush took office. 
 In a news conference in Columbus, Ind., the headquarters of Cummins Engine, a major manufacturer of diesel engines, the environmental protection administrator, Stephen L. Johnson, said, ''Under President Bush's leadership, the pumps are primed to deliver clean diesel and a cleaner future for America.''
 The new fuel contains 15 parts per million of sulfur, down from the standard of 500 parts per million, thanks to changes in the refining process. As of Sunday, at least 80 percent of the diesel available for trucks and buses has to meet the new standard. 
 Officials of the environmental agency said Tuesday that the changeover was occurring so swiftly that 90 percent of the fuel would be compatible.
 Old diesel engines burning the cleaner fuel will reduce dangerous particulate emissions by 10 percent, experts say. New engines with improved controls, which have to be available by Jan. 1, will cut this particulate pollution by more than 95 percent. The rule mandates more improved engines in 2010. It is unclear how soon existing trucks and buses, which often are in use for more than 10 years, will be turned in for newer models.
 The new fuel is expected to cost 3 cents to 5 cents more per gallon. Like many regulations that took effect in the twilight of the Clinton administration, the diesel rule, covering fuel and the seven million trucks and buses on the roads, was temporarily stayed by the Bush administration. 
 Then the Environmental Protection Agency allowed it to proceed and in 2004 supplemented it with a similar rule requiring tight controls on engines in off-road equipment like cranes, tractors and construction equipment.
 Leading environmental groups linked arms with industry in a chorus of praise for the new fuel and engines to follow. They emphasized the health benefits and the novel wording of the rule. Unlike earlier regulations, the new rule links the development of the new fuel to developing cleaner-burning engines. Richard Kassel, a senior lawyer and air-pollution specialist with the Natural Resources Defense Counsel, said that when planning for the rule began in 1995, gasoline-powered cars outnumbered diesel-powered trucks and buses by 190 million to 6.7 million. 
 The diesel vehicles emitted 43 percent of the smog- and particulate-forming nitrogen oxides and more than two-thirds of the soot. Even though the diesel-produced particulates were 3 percent of the total particulate matter in the air, most of which was from industrial sources, Mr. Kassel added, ''tailpipe particulates are coming out right where we breathe.''
 Mr. Johnson said diesel engines had been the workhorses of the economy and the vehicle fleet. 
 The relatively high sulfur levels in diesel have been a significant obstacle to producing diesel-powered cars that met federal environmental standards. 
 Several engine and automobile manufacturers have signaled that more high-mileage diesel-fueled cars, a fixture on European highways, may become available. 
 Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the Diesel Technology Forum, an industry group, said in a conference call Tuesday that the new standard was also significant because it ''opens up the door of possibility'' to a new generation of light-duty diesel cars and trucks in the United States in the near future. 
 The environmental agency estimates that when the current truck and bus fleets have been replaced and all are using the heavy-diesel engines that will become standard-issue next year, the new rule will prevent 8,300 premature deaths annually. 
 In the Clinton and Bush administrations, the development and roll-out of the diesel rule for trucks and buses has been notable for the cooperation among industry, the government and environmental groups, officials of the three groups have said. 
 Margo T. Oge, director of the office of mobile sources in the agency's air division, said Tuesday that the speed with which the new fuel became available had exceeded the agency's expectations.
 Carol M. Browner, the administrator who signed the original rule, bristled on Tuesday at the Bush administration's proprietary attitude.
 ''The best they can do in environmental policy,'' Ms. Browner asked, ''is take credit for someone else's work?''

HEADLINE: The Shock Waves From North Korea

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''North Korea and the Bomb'' (editorial, Oct. 10):
 What harm is there in talking directly to North Korea?
 America's unwillingness to talk to that country's top leaders during George W. Bush's presidency is one of the main reasons North Korea is out there flexing its nuclear muscles. 
 There is nothing to lose, only much to be gained from talking to its leaders face to face. Talking is not weakness in a dangerous nuclear world; it is simply common sense. 
 President Bush must be the one to talk to enemy leaders, not just Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Is he up to this critical task, or would he rather let the bullets and bombs of the world's mightiest military power do his talking? 
 If it is the latter, perilous days are ahead. 

Paul L. Whiteley Sr.
Louisville, Ky., Oct. 10, 2006

To the Editor:
 David Frum's prescription for dealing with North Korea's nuclear program is typical of a former Bush administration official (''Mutually Assured Disruption,'' Op-Ed, Oct. 10).
 All his ideas -- expanding missile defenses, ending humanitarian aid to North Korea, expanding NATO and encouraging Japan to develop nuclear weapons -- are sure to isolate and anger North Korea and China and to destabilize the region, when what is needed is calm, smart diplomacy, which the Bush administration has shown zero aptitude for.
 North Korea's nuclear test, while deplorable, is just the latest disaster in the administration's failed, incoherent nonproliferation policy.
 Iraq gets invaded over phantom nuclear weapons. Pakistan opens a veritable nuclear Wal-Mart and barely gets a slap on the wrist. India develops a nuclear bomb and gets rewarded with a deal for nuclear material and technology. 
 Israel's robust nuclear arsenal is winked at, while Iran is threatened with sanctions, bombing and regime change over its nuclear program, which is years away from weaponization, if its government actually wants that.
 Add in the Bush administration's refusal to resubmit the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the Senate for ratification, and is it any wonder the United States has no credibility on nonproliferation?

Kevin Martin
Exec. Dir., Peace Action
Silver Spring, Md., Oct. 10, 2006

To the Editor:
 I am tired of hearing administration officials say that North Korea's actions are unacceptable and then doing nothing in response. 
 With each successive provocative act, the threshold of unacceptable behavior seems to get higher.
 I am also tired of hearing it said that China is helping to solve the problem. It is not. It is the problem. 
 I agree with all of David Frum's measures in response to the North Korean action, but would go further and deny the Chinese the right to dump their goods in our marketplace. The problem with dealing strongly with China, however, is that too many political and economic elites in this country have interests in China.
 As with our support for oil-rich Arab potentates, we are putting profits above principles. Sometime in the future, the democracies of South Korea, Japan and the United States are going to pay dearly for the craven policies of appeasement that have resulted in a desperate country's acquisition of nuclear weapons.

Daniel T. Grossman
Clifton, N.J., Oct. 10, 2006

To the Editor:
 David Frum's contention that ''rogue regimes must be made to suffer for their dangerous nuclear ambitions'' ignores reality. 
 It is American ownership of nuclear power and weaponry, along with those we allow into the nuclear club, that encourages nuclear ambition among rogue nations. 
 The rogue nations are convinced that nuclear power is their only protection against what they perceive as United States imperialism. 

Joan Salemi
West Springfield, Va., Oct. 10, 2006

To the Editor:
 The way to stop North Korea is to prevent it from achieving its goals (front page, Oct. 10). Pyongyang wanted nuclear weapons to enhance its security and international prestige. Let's make sure that it gets neither.
 Let the United States announce that it is making nuclear weapons and delivery systems available to Japan and South Korea to defend them against the North Korean nuclear threat, cancel all diplomatic contacts with North Korea, and outlaw all trade and even humanitarian assistance until its nuclear program has been completely dismantled under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Yaakov Kornreich
Brooklyn, Oct. 10, 2006

To the Editor:
 The Bush administration is right that we don't want a mushroom cloud, but it is talking about the wrong country. 
 Now that the dunderheaded invasion of Iraq has lowered our world stature, consumed our military might and depleted our treasury, we are in a weaker position to deal with an actual threat from North Korea. 
 Mr. President, you're doing a ''heck of a job'' for our security.

HEADLINE: No Hurry To Cut Rates At the Fed 

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Despite indications that inflation pressures may be starting to ease, the Federal Reserve is not inclined to lower short-term interest rates anytime soon, minutes from its most recent meeting show. 
 The reason is uncertainty: uncertainty about the housing market, uncertainty about economic growth and most of all, uncertainty about inflation.
The minutes, released Wednesday after the customary three-week lag from the Sept. 20 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which makes Fed policy, showed that most monetary policy makers expected the economy to slow ''in the near term'' but pick up speed later. 
 Nonetheless, committee members remained wary of inflation, with the minutes indicating that officials ''continued to see a substantial risk that inflation would not decline as anticipated.''
 ''Most participants thought that the most likely outcome was a reduction in inflation pressures,'' the minutes said. ''But the anticipated decline was only gradual and the uncertainties around that forecast were skewed toward higher rather than lower inflation rates.''
 The word ''uncertainty'' or some variation of it appears five times in the minutes.
 The decision to leave the overnight benchmark lending rate unchanged at 5.25 percent reflected the belief that falling energy prices and more than two years of previous interest rate increases would help hold inflation down.
 While the minutes noted that Fed members believed that their decision last month to leave interest rates unchanged for a second consecutive month was ''somewhat less difficult'' than their decision in August, it was not a unanimous vote. One of the 10 voting members, Jeffrey M. Lacker, favored a quarter-point rate increase instead.
 Yesterday in Washington, Mr. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., expanded on the reasons for his dissent. In a speech to the District of Columbia Chamber of Commerce, he said he was concerned that Americans might learn to accept higher inflation as the rule rather than an exception.
 ''If the Fed were to allow inflation to remain above target for too long, inflation expectations could become centered around the higher rate,'' he said. 
 For the last two Fed meetings, Mr. Lacker has been the sole dissenter when the committee voted to leave interest rates unchanged. 
 ''We don't have any perfect measures of inflation expectations,'' he said, ''but what we do have suggests that market participants do not foresee a rapid fall in core inflation. That is why I have argued for further policy actions to convincingly restore price stability.''
 Many investors have been betting that the Fed will keep rates unchanged for now and eventually cut them. Bond yields, which move in the opposite direction from their price, had been falling since early July, indicating that investors thought the Fed's next move would be to cut rates. When interest rates fall, so do bond yields, making them less attractive investments.
 But late last month, bond yields began to rise; after a speech last week by Donald L. Kohn, the Fed's vice chairman, the trend was reinforced. Yesterday the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury closed at 4.78 percent, up from 4.75 on Tuesday. The stock market also fell after the Fed released its minutes in mid-afternoon.
 Trading in futures markets suggests that most investors now see only a slight chance that the Fed will cut rates by March.
 ''The Fed itself, while firmly on hold in the near term, is more biased toward tightening than easing,'' said Dean Maki, chief United States economist for Barclays Capital. ''In the minutes, there was no discussion of the possibility of rate cuts, while they did reference the possibility of additional firming.''
 Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, a consulting firm, wrote in a research report, ''The overall message of these minutes is that the F.O.M.C. is in no hurry at all to ease monetary policy.''

HEADLINE: It's Good Advice, and the Price Is Right 

BYLINE: By ANNE FIELD

 BODY:
As a general rule, you can't get something for nothing. But there are exceptions, as the people at Ironclad Performance Wear discovered three years ago. Since starting up in 1998, the company in El Segundo, Calif., had made a splash selling work gloves that incorporate technology and materials usually used for, say, mountain climbing. But, the company also knew that to fuel growth, it would need to expand into highly specialized new markets. How best to determine the next step?
 The answer was to tap the insights of an unconventional group of consultants. Instead of approaching the usual high-ticket McKinsey types, the company's vice president for sales and marketing, Kent Pachl, decided to try another source: a course for M.B.A.'s taught at the Graziadio School of Business and Management at nearby Pepperdine University. The course offered management consulting services to selected companies, free of charge.
After getting approval from the faculty, Mr. Pachl spent an hour explaining his problem to the class, which was divided into five teams. After 15 weeks, each group presented a proposal on what markets should be the company's focus and how to go about pursuing them. 
 After hearing their presentations, Mr. Pachl decided to further study two of the suggested industries -- oil services and the military -- and eventually, to go after them. Now, according to Mr. Pachl, about 10 percent of the company's $7 million in revenue is from sales to those areas, and he expects that number to rise to 25 percent over the next two years. The experience was such a success, in fact, that, last spring, Mr. Pachl worked on another project with a Pepperdine class, this time analyzing the most effective ways to distribute a new line of apparel. ''The program's cost savings have meant we can spend more on launching the product, and less on paying consultants,'' he said.
 Ironclad is not the only small business to take advantage of such services. While no exact numbers exist, well over 100 of the 900 graduate business schools in the country include for-credit courses in which students provide consulting services to companies, according to John Fernandes, chief executive of AACSB International - Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, in Tampa, Fla. 
 Not all the programs are free. But even the ones that come with a fee -- the Kogod School of Business at American University, for example, charges companies $5,000 -- can be a godsend for time- and cash-short small businesses looking for a helping hand. M.B.A. students work on anything from creating a new business plan to tackling succession issues, providing resources that many businesses ''simply wouldn't have access to otherwise,'' said Doreen Shanahan, Pepperdine's Education to Business program director. 
 Why are so many M.B.A. schools doing this? Quite simply, the programs are a response to the wishes of employers who are looking to hire M.B.A.'s with more hands-on experience. ''Companies need graduates to hit the ground running, to be better able to apply business theory immediately,'' Mr. Fernandes said. 
 At the same time, there's no cookie-cutter model for these programs. At Pepperdine, for example, as Mr. Pachl discovered, there's a competition, in which students all tackle a problem faced by the same company, dividing up into teams to devise a proposal. It is also a required course. On the other hand, American University has an elective, in which faculty members choose companies to work with, then advertise each project to students and select teams from applicants.
 Occasionally, projects also develop from a professor's particular areas of interest. Four years ago, David Gay, a professor of economics at the Sam M. Walton College of Business Administration at the University of Arkansas, who studies the economics of the wine industry, decided the wineries in the area would make a good consulting project. So, he approached the Arkansas Wine Producers' Council, a group of five small family-owned wineries, about using his class to study how the industry could attract more tourism. 
 The companies agreed, and Professor Gay then worked with his students to divide the assignment into small pieces: marketing, legal issues, technology and the like. At the end of the semester, the class made a final presentation to the consortium, with suggestions ranging from starting a Web site to using so-called neck holders on bottles, with information about each wine.
 In most cases, faculty or program administrators start off by working with companies to fine-tune the focus of the project. That is especially important for small businesses, according to the schools. ''They're so stretched on multiple levels, they often come to us with extremely broad requests,'' said Robert Krapfel, associate professor of marketing at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland. ''My job is to home in and narrow the scope.''
 Consider Travis Schneider, founder of a three-year-old company, StarBrand Media, in Pacific Palisades, Calif., which provides an online shopping source for fashions and other products featured in television shows and movies. Last spring, he worked with Pepperdine's program to devise a marketing strategy, focusing on how to make the brand more interesting to consumer-products companies. But, when he first approached the school, ''He just told us, he wanted to grow revenues,'' Ms. Shanahan said. Through a series of meetings, the two came up with a more narrow focus.
 Not every small business that wants to participate in these programs is appropriate, however. Take the University of Arkansas. Situated down the road from the headquarters of Wal-Mart, it is surrounded by offices of major corporations, which provide the majority of the applicant pool. More important, participating businesses have to be facing a challenge appropriate for high-level analysis. In most cases, companies must also be past the start-up stage, with a product they have already brought to market. 
 Of course, there are downsides. A big one has to do with timing. ''If a business needs advice tomorrow and it's springtime, they may be out of luck if the class isn't meeting until the fall,'' said James Nolen, senior lecturer in the finance department at the McCombs School of Business of the University of Texas at Austin. There's also the time commitment. Businesses have to be prepared to meet with students throughout the semester. 
 Another potential problem is the students' level of sophistication. Even those with a few years of work under their belt probably lack the experience and industry knowledge of a more conventional consultant.
 Still, there are ways around some of these issues. To streamline the process, for example, a team usually picks one student to be the leader, responsible for funneling questions to a point person at the company. 
 Daniel Abraham took another tack. Mr. Abraham is the chief executive of Fortius One, a one-year-old firm based in Washington that provides analysis for business decisions involving geography. He recently worked with a team of students at the University of Maryland to study which of six specific vertical markets the company should enter. To make sure the students were as focused as possible, he kicked off the project by developing separate mission statements laying out the needs that each market had to address.
 ''If I didn't do that, I think it might have ended up being a waste of time,'' he said. Ultimately, according to Mr. Abraham, the students came up with many useful insights that helped the company decide which areas to focus on first. 
 Ultimately, many small businesses say the pros simply outweigh the cons. ''We got some fresh ideas from a group of 20-somethings at a tremendous cost savings,'' Mr. Pachl said. ''I've already told the school, next time they're looking for a new project to work on, we'll do it again.''

HEADLINE: In the New China, Banks Still Cling to Old Ways 

BYLINE: By AUSTAN GOOLSBEE. 
Austan Goolsbee is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and a research fellow at the American Bar Foundation. E-mail: goolsbee@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
Perhaps nothing seems to represent new China more than the gleaming, ultramodern headquarters of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. Its laminated glass exterior was intended to showcase the modern, transparent face of China's largest bank. Inside the building, though, many elements hark back to more traditional forms. Wave patterns in the lobby floor and the circular interior space recall a traditional courtyard garden. 
 The announcement this week of details of the planned initial public offering of the bank -- potentially the largest offering in financial history, topping $21 billion -- has foreign investors in a frenzied clamor to get a toehold in the booming Chinese financial market. Apparently, Chinese banking, like Chinese manufacturing before it, has arrived. 
But according to the work of the economists Anil Kashyap at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and Wendy Dobson at the University of Toronto, banks in the new China may look modern on the outside, but they are not so far from their traditional roots. Their behavior seems closer to the 1990's crony capitalism of neighbors like Indonesia and Thailand, which engendered financial panics, than to that of international financial centers like London and New York. 
 The study of Chinese banks by Professors Kashyap and Dobson, titled ''The Contradiction in China's Gradualist Banking Reforms'' (which is available at http://faculty.chicagogsb.edu/anil.kashyap/research/chinabanksoctfullpaper.pdf), raises some troubling issues about the four big government-owned Chinese banks and, by implication, their initial public offerings. 
 The basic problem, they say, is that the Chinese government owns the banks and will continue to control them after the public offerings. The government has always exercised ultimate authority over the banks' lending decisions and, historically, has forced them to lend to corrupt and inefficient state-owned enterprises. That leaves the banks with a large share of loans that, effectively, default. Despite the recent reforms, that basic interference continues. 
 Because the government now badly wants to modernize its financial sector and bring it up to Western standards, it has made a clear attempt to clean up the balance sheets of the big banks in preparation for their public offerings. The Industrial and Commercial Bank received a direct infusion of something like $30 billion from the Ministry of Finance and the Chinese central bank. The government also reduced Industrial and Commercial's ratio of ''nonperforming loans'' to less than 5 percent from 34 percent in 2000 by taking $35 billion in failed loans off its books and giving them to specially created ''asset management companies'' (which, suffice it to say, will probably not be having public offerings anytime soon). 
 At the same time, however, the government desperately wants to prevent a breakdown of regional stability and an overwhelming mass migration of workers out of rural areas (especially before it stages the Olympics in 2008). One major way it does that is by using bank loans to keep afloat the major employers in those remote areas: state-owned enterprises. Those are the same employers that failed to pay back the previous loans. Lending them money another time will, of course, mean that a large fraction of the bank's loans will again go sour. By that point, though, the bank's initial public offering will be long completed. 
 As Professor Kashyap put it in an interview: ''They can move the toxic stuff off the bank's balance sheet but the key issue going forward is whether the same people are in charge of credit evaluation. The government owns them. If someone from the party calls up and says, 'Give money to State Store No. 6,' are they going to say no? If not, then the bad loans will pile up again.''
 He cites the case of a detailed examination by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company of the loans by one Chinese bank to companies in a particular region. For some 60 percent of the loans, the bank had no record of what collateral the borrower had given, what industry the borrower was in or even which bank official had made the decision to lend the money. 
 The Dobson-Kashyap study suggests that despite a laminate of reform pasted onto the banks in preparation for their public offerings, loan behavior looks quite familiar. The government-run banks continue to lend intensively in regions that have high shares of state-owned enterprises. Some of the highest lending rates are to remote regions like those bordering on Tibet, where the government wants people to stay.
 The authors do admit that so long as China maintains the torrid growth rates of the last 10 years, the problems of the banking system will largely go unnoticed. Only with a slowdown may these flaws ignite a crisis. 
 But they are wary about China's ability to sustain its growth rates. They point out that astounding rates of industrial investment -- on the order of 43 percent of gross domestic product -- have largely driven the current boom and that these investments have been artificially stimulated by cheap government loans. They point out that in the steel industry, for example, China has 120 million tons of unused capacity and yet is investing in another 70 million tons. 
 According to Professor Kashyap: ''If there is a slowdown, there will be a day of reckoning. It might be in a long, long time or it might be the day after the Olympics.''
 Back in Beijing, optimists turn to the Industrial and Commercial Bank building as a symbol of the bank's future. It looks transparent and feels decidedly of new China. Yet one cannot help noticing that it is situated only a few blocks from the seat of government in Beijing and the huge painting of Mao in Tiananmen Square. The real estate agent's refrain hangs over the bustling air of the bank's interior courtyard. No matter where you are these days, it's still about three things: di dian, di dian, di dian (location, location, location).

HEADLINE: Profit Rises 53% at Infosys, a Top Indian Outsourcing Company

BYLINE: By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
One of India's largest outsourcing companies, Infosys Technologies, announced a 53 percent climb in its quarterly profit on Wednesday, surpassing market expectations and reflecting a strong demand for technology and back-office services from Western customers. 
 [The company, which is publicly traded, also said Wednesday that it planned a large international stock offering of sponsored American depository receipts worth nearly $1.5 billion, Bloomberg News reported.]
The financial results from Infosys, a bellwether for the industry, augured well for India's $23.6 billion outsourcing industry and indicated that companies were growing at a striking pace despite a shortage of skilled workers, rising salaries and a gradual slowdown in the American economy.
 The results of other top outsourcing concerns like Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro and Satyam Computer, scheduled in coming days, are expected to reflect those at Infosys.
 The company, based in Bangalore, said its quarterly profit rose 9.29 billion rupees ($203.7 million at current rates) from 6.06 billion rupees last year. Revenue grew more than 50 percent, to 34.5 billion rupees ($756.6 million). The company added 45 customers in the quarter ended in September, in addition to increasing business from existing clients like Microsoft and ABN Amro Bank. 
 The chief executive of Infosys, Nandan M. Nilekani, remarked after the earnings announcement, ''Our business model provides compelling value to clients in a flat world.'' 
 Shares of Infosys, whose revenue is forecast to exceed $3 billion this fiscal year, rose nearly 4 percent Wednesday on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The news also lifted the share prices of Tata Consultancy and Wipro.
 An estimated $118 billion annually in global outsourcing contracts are to expire by 2008, according to a report by the Everest Research Institute of Dallas. About half these contracts are likely to be redrawn, and India's outsourcing companies are positioning themselves for this business.
 ''We see competition only heating up as the offshore players step into the fray,'' said Kara Wyatt, chief operating officer of Everest Research, referring to the Indian concerns. ''These newcomers now have the experience, cost advantages and critical mass to be serious contenders.''
 The Indian companies, even as they compete for increased business, worry that a general shortage of qualified technology workers will strain their low-cost model. Infosys Technologies hired 10,795 workers in the quarter recently ended, bringing its employee strength to 66,000. 
 Although Indian engineers are paid a fraction of the wages that Westerners receive, salaries are increasing steadily. ''Entry-level wages have begun to rise 10-20 percent annually,'' said Ashish R. Thadhani, senior vice president for research at Gilford Securities in New York. 
 A slowing of the American economy is another challenge facing outsourcing companies, analysts said. ''One cannot rule out the potential,'' Mr. Thadhani said, ''for a brief pause in spending as clients take stock of a changing environment.'' 
 But Siddharth A. Pai, a partner at the outsourcing advisory firm TPI in Woodlands, Tex., said that the demographics of a young population would work in India's favor and serve as a growth engine for its outsourcing companies. ''With more young workers coming into the pool,'' he said, ''growth will sustain at the current levels in the next 36 to 48 months.''

HEADLINE: A Newspaper Investigates Its Future

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Newspapers are all looking for ways to gain readers, and many have hired consultants to help them. In an unusual twist, The Los Angeles Times is looking to chart its future by using its own reporters and editors, who rank among the best investigators in the business.
 The Times is dedicating three investigative reporters and half a dozen editors to find ideas, at home and abroad, for re-engaging the reader, both in print and online. The newspaper's editor, Dean Baquet, and its new publisher, David Hiller, plan to convene a meeting today to start the effort, which is being called the Manhattan Project. A report is expected in about two months. 
''The newsroom is energized about innovation,'' Mr. Hiller said. ''And having the code name of the Manhattan Project captures the sense of significance and urgency that I think is altogether called for.''
 The name refers, of course, to the American effort to develop an atomic bomb during World War II, an-exaggerated-for-effect overstatement of the problems facing ink-on-paper newspapers: declining circulation, stagnant ad revenues and rising costs. While visits to newspaper Web sites are increasing, they account for a small part of revenue and do not draw enough advertising to support newsroom operations.
 The Los Angeles project sprang from recent turmoil at the paper, when Mr. Baquet and the previous publisher, Jeffrey M. Johnson, said in the pages of the newspaper that they would not go along with cuts ordered by the corporate parent, the Tribune Company. Tribune has cut more than 20 percent of the 1,200 newsroom employees since it bought the paper in 2000. 
 The company dismissed Mr. Johnson last week. Mr. Baquet said he agreed to stay because he was convinced he would have the chance to make a new case for shoring up both his staff and his budget.
 Those involved in the project said they did not want to be passive by-standers as their paper, like many metro dailies, struggled to transform itself in the Internet age.
 ''We shouldn't be waiting for corporate headquarters or a think tank or a consultant to come up with ideas to secure our future,'' said Marc Duvoisin, an assistant managing editor who will direct the investigation. 
 The project underscores just how focused many newsrooms have become on the business side of journalism, especially as Wall Street has shown little confidence in the industry and as share prices of most news organizations have dropped. 
 ''We realized we had to act fast or we wouldn't have anything to act for,'' said Vernon Loeb, the paper's California investigations editor, who helped originate the idea. 
 Tribune's plan to make more cuts at The Los Angeles Times is presumably still on the table, though it is not clear how deep they may go or over what period of time. A company spokesman in Chicago declined to comment on the project. But the team in Los Angeles said the goal was to produce ideas that could be put in place without waiting for permission, or money, from Chicago.
 Newspapers have long struggled to find ways to attract more readers, and the Los Angeles paper in particular has had a hard time figuring out how to balance its national and international ambitions with the demands of covering its sprawling backyard. Adding to the uncertainty is the stated interest of three local billionaires in buying the paper and concentrating on local news.
 Robert Niles, editor of the Online Journalism Review at the University of Southern California, has suggested that the billionaires start a Web site instead, reflecting a sense among some that online publishing will someday push aside many print newspapers.
 Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, teaches seminars in newsrooms trying to rethink their futures. He said that when he asked reporters and editors to imagine how they would build a newspaper from scratch, they had more fun tossing around ideas about their newspaper online than in print.
 Those on the project in Los Angeles said they were already mulling several ideas. They include creating new sections; adding columnists and using citizens to ''report'' on local matters; and expanding the paper statewide. The Times in recent years has eliminated its national edition and cut back its availability outside of Southern California.
 Newsrooms are often involved in brainstorming ideas to make their papers more appealing, but they typically limit themselves to the journalistic realm. The Los Angeles effort differs from most in that it could affect the paper's business side and it is transparent to the public while the reporting is in progress.
 ''We want to collect the best thinking on how to sustain the vitality and profitability of the print franchise,'' Mr. Duvoisin said. ''And we want to find the best thinking on how to transfer our journalism to the Web in the way most likely to grow audience and revenue.'' 
 But Mr. Loeb described the changes to come from the investigative project as a ''reimagining'' of the print paper in conjunction with the Web site.
 The team plans to seek ideas from across the country and perhaps London, where news pages rely heavily on opinion, and Oslo, where a newspaper company called Schibsted is perceived to be in the vanguard of Web-based journalism (though the company recently told The Economist that it turns down its many requests from foreign journalists or it would not get anything done).
 The reporters on the project are Glenn F. Bunting, Chris Gaither and T. Christian Miller, the author of ''Blood Money,'' a new book about corruption, waste and fraud among those trying to profit from the rebuilding of Iraq. 
 As for the notion that reporters could come up with solutions to what ails the business, Mr. Niles said, ''None of these legions of other people have come up with the answers, so why shouldn't reporters take a shot?''

HEADLINE: A Razor-Sharp Profile Cuts Into a Mile-High Cityscape

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
For those who admired Daniel Libeskind's early work, his recent trajectory has been painful to watch. After soaring to stardom in 1999 with the evocative zigzagging form of his Jewish Museum in Berlin, he has suffered humiliation in his role as master planner at ground zero, not so much for his design as his consistent refusal to stand up for it. And his worst buildings, like a 2002 war museum in England suggesting the shards of a fractured globe, can seem like a caricature of his own aesthetic.
 The new addition to the Denver Art Museum captures all of the contradictions within Mr. Libeskind's oeuvre. Its bold, often mesmerizing forms reaffirm the originality of his talent, yet its tortured geometries make it a daunting place to install or view art -- hardly a minor drawback. And for all its emotional power, the building seems eerily out of date, and its flaws readily apparent. 
The centerpiece of the city's new cultural district, the museum is composed as a series of interlocking rectangles evoking a pile of boxes tumbling across the site. The entrance faces a new plaza dotted with trees that links the Civic Center with the Golden Triangle, a neighborhood of once-dilapidated boarding houses that developers are transforming into a hip neighborhood for young urbanites. 
 The new plaza is a well-worn formula: museums, shops and a loftlike apartment complex, also designed by Mr. Libeskind, that are intended to manufacture an instantly vibrant street life. Civic leaders promise that it will help revitalize downtown Denver. (The museum opened on Oct. 7.)
 Within this context the museum can be magical. In its most striking feature, a triangular form at one corner shoots out over a street toward the old Gio Ponti museum building. A bridge connects the two buildings just underneath. Other forms tumble out toward the plaza, partly sheltering the entrance. Yet the genius of the exterior lies in how its appearances when viewed from varying directions. Fragments of the cantilevered beak-like form can be gleaned between towering downtown buildings; from other angles the structure seems static and bunkerlike. At night the building tends to flatten out, giving it a strange stillness.
 Mr. Libeskind pulls some of that energy right up through the building. Visitors enter the galleries by ascending a staircase that spirals up through a four-story atrium lobby. As you climb, the staircase gets tighter, more intimate. Slivers of daylight enter through slotlike skylights set where the walls intersect, so that at times the building looks as if it were pulling apart at the seams. Farther up, beams crisscross the space as if to prevent the walls from falling in on you.
 The intersecting geometries yield the sort of wonderfully odd, leftover spaces typical of an attic, and Mr. Libeskind takes advantage of this by setting up small sitting areas within some of them. 
 Resting on a sofa, you may catch a glimpse of a silhouetted figure wandering up the staircase several levels above. At other times the experience can be like entering the jarring, riotous forms of an Expressionist canvas by Max Beckman.
 Yet this is a place for viewing real works of art. And if criticizing contemporary architects for creating flamboyant museums that mistreat the art they house has become a tiresome pastime, it is overwhelmingly justified here. In a building of canted walls and asymmetrical rooms -- tortured geometries generated purely by formal considerations -- it is virtually impossible to enjoy the art.
 The curators have made a valiant effort. Some of the sculpture, for example, looks terrific here. Antony Gormely's 2000 ''Quantum Cloud XXXIII,'' an anonymous figure fashioned from stainless steel rods, seems to splinter off into space, as if the entire building were floating in pieces around it. But paintings by Degas and Pissarro look absolutely lost in the chaos of the surroundings. A row of Campbell's soup can paintings by Warhol hangs on one side of a column, as if the curators had given up trying to find a suitable spot for them.
 Just as disconcerting is how dated the building looks. Its titanium cladding, whether a respectful homage or a tired appropriation of the famous skin used for Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, looks oddly familiar. And more generally, it can remind you of Mr. Libeskind's geometries in earlier projects: the boxlike tumbling forms of an unbuilt addition for the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the skewed cantilevered shapes of the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco. It's as if you've seen the same building again and again. And unlike, say, Mr. Gehry's best work, the structures often seem shaped entirely by their own internal logic; their relation to their function and the buildings around them seems strained or artificial.
 This problem may be related to the arc of Mr. Libeskind's career. Many of his contemporaries spent the first phase of their professional lives in a desperate struggle to build, laboring night and day as unknowns, churning out design after design that went nowhere. But in the process they built up a storehouse of ideas they could draw on when they finally made a name for themselves and commissions began to pour in.
 Mr. Libeskind spent the first decade or more of his career as an academic. By the time his Berlin museum was completed, he was 54 and had spent an entire decade pouring his heart into a single building that remains his greatest architectural achievement. His newfound celebrity resulted in a torrent of commissions, yet it seems as though he is struggling to expand on that earlier language, as if his stardom has not allowed him the time or space to explore new strains in his work.
 The residential and retail complex he designed across the plaza from the museum looks like a cheap knockoff of his own building. Wrapping around two sides of a five-story parking structure, it lacks compositional rigor. 
 Oddly shaped forms are grafted onto the facades with no apparent rhyme or reason. A gridlike facade of crisscrossing mullions looks cheap and overwrought. And the interiors are blandly conventional except for the random positioning of some windows, which do make for some strange views.
 You can't help wondering what all this bodes for Mr. Libeskind's future. He is building a German military history museum in Dresden and a performing arts center in Dublin; he is at work on more than two dozen residential and office towers in cities like Milan, Singapore, Toronto and Sacramento, Calif. Some of these clients are serious about producing quality architecture; others are probably in it for the Libeskind name.
 But for any architect the proof is in the work, and Denver is a maddening bundle. At turns enchanting, predictable and irritating, it is uncompromising in all the wrong ways.

HEADLINE: A Notable Chess Journey for Talented New York Girls

BYLINE: By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

 BODY:
Medina Parrilla, a sophomore at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, is nervous about a trip next week to Batumi, in Georgia, a republic of the former Soviet Union. She is going to compete in the World Youth Chess Championships.
 But Medina said: ''I'm not nervous about playing. I passed that stage a long time ago. I'm nervous about the country. I don't know what to expect from a place like that.'' 
Darrian Robinson, a seventh grader at Intermediate School 318 in Brooklyn, who is going with Medina as part of the United States team, said she was excited about venturing to a new place. 
 The girls are accomplished chess players -- Medina, 15, is ranked No. 7 in the country among girls under 16 and Darrian, 12, is No. 6 among girls under 13 -- but they stand out among their roughly 25 teammates because as African-Americans they will be making history at the tournament. 
 It will be the first time that two African-American players have represented the United States in an international chess competition. That both are girls makes it that much more remarkable. 
 Although chess is a meritocratic game -- all a player needs is a set, a board and an opponent-- African-American players competing in organized tournaments are rare, according to Bill Hall, executive director of the United States Chess Federation. 
 Part of the reason, he suspects, has to do with economic barriers.
 ''There is a significant cost associated with attending national events, and if you don't have a developed program in your school, then airfare and hotel rooms can be prohibitive,'' he said. 
 Medina and Darrian said that in the past they had private sponsors finance some of their trips, particularly those abroad. But their parents have also had to shoulder a financial burden.
 Darrian said that her mother, Cenceria Edwards, who is a lawyer, paid the entry fee for many of her tournaments. And when she went away, her mother always went with her. ''Sponsors pay for me, but my mom has to pay for herself,'' she said. 
 Ms. Edwards estimated that it cost $10,000 to $12,000 a year to support Darrian's chess activities. 
 Another obstacle for African-Americans, Medina said, is cultural. ''Caucasian parents get their children into chess early,'' she said. 
 Maurice Ashley of Queens, the only African-American to achieve the rank of grandmaster, the highest title awarded by the World Chess Federation, went a step further. ''I think that the full truth of that is that in the U.S. chess is unusual,'' he said. ''Chess is not taken as seriously here'' as in other countries. 
 This will be Darrian's first trip to the World Youth championships. Medina has played twice before and she knows that being an African-American player can draw some curiosity. 
 Three years ago, when she played in the championships in Greece, she said other competitors were curious about her. ''Some walked up to touch my skin,'' Medina said. ''Others asked if they could touch my hair.'' She said she did not mind the attention. 
 The girls started playing chess for different reasons. 
 Medina, who lives in the South Bronx, said that she wanted to find something that she could do better than her two older brothers. ''One is smarter,'' she said. ''One plays basketball. It was the only thing I thought I could beat my brothers in.''
 When she started, about age 8, Medina's brother, Rayshawn, would beat her and she would cry. Now, Medina says, flashing a Cheshire-like grin, ''He doesn't play me anymore.''
 Darrian started playing chess as a way to get involved in an after-school activity. She did not think she would be good at anything else. Actually, she wasn't any good at chess either. 
 She was a fourth grader at Public School 308 in Bedford-Stuyvesant and she went to a tryout for the school's chess club. The teacher, Thomas A. Haggins, gave her and other students some problems and he told them that anyone who solved at least one problem could stay. 
 Darrian got them all wrong. ''I tried, but I didn't know how the pieces moved,'' she said. Told to leave by Mr. Haggins, she did not.
 ''I didn't get picked for anything else,'' Darrian said, ''so I just stayed.'' The next day, she went back and Mr. Haggins relented and let her play. Stubbornness is a useful trait in a chess player. So are discipline and focus.
 ''A lot of girls worry about their nails and their hair,'' Medina said. ''A lot of girls are worrying about boys. That is not one of my priorities.'' 
 Chess clearly is. She has played in more than 150 tournaments and she said she often solves 100 chess problems a day. When she returns home after a tournament, she immediately begins analyzing her games to see what she did right or wrong.
 Darrian is similarly focused. She has in played more than 100 tournaments and when she is home, and ''my homework is done,'' she goes online to play chess. Lately, said Ms. Edwards, she has had to monitor Darrian because she has been staying up later and later to play chess.
 Although they are four years apart in age, the two girls have formed a bond. Medina said Darrian ''is like a little sister.'' Darrian, who has two sisters who are 21, looks up to Medina.
 As they sat and talked at the Marshall Chess Club on West 10th Street in Manhattan on a recent Saturday morning, Darrian mentioned that all she liked to do was play chess. ''I do chess all day,'' she said.
 Medina shot her a knowing look. ''When I was 11 or 12, I was the same way,'' she said. ''As you get older, you get into other things.''

HEADLINE: Electrical Short Forces New Shutdown of Largest U.S. Oil Field 

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
The United States' largest oil field will be shut down for several days as its operator, BP, scrambles to fix an electrical problem.
 So far, the loss of 300,000 barrels a day of Alaskan output has not rattled oil markets.
BP PLC said electrical shorts that shut down the Prudhoe Bay field on Tuesday followed three days of dust storms and then rain, coating insulators on high-voltage lines with mud. 
 The company, which is based in London, has faced intense criticism after two oil leaks in Alaska over the last seven months and said the shutdown of its power system was not a reflection of aging infrastructure.
 Production was 350,000 barrels a day on Monday, but that fell to just 35,000 barrels on Tuesday, after the power failure.
 Prudhoe Bay had produced more than 400,000 barrels a day until leaks and the discovery of pipe corrosion led the company to begin shutting down the eastern half of the field on Aug. 6.
 The eastern side of the field was restarted late last month as the company began to clean out the transit pipeline there.
 A company spokesman, Daren Beaudo, pinned the latest problem problem on a ''highly unusual weather event,'' partly attributable to the lack of snow in the region. But at least one industry analyst, Michael Lynch, questioned whether BP's troubles could be blamed entirely on weather. ''People who are bad carpenters hit themselves on the thumb repeatedly,'' said Mr. Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research Inc. of Winchester, Mass.
 Mr. Lynch acknowledged that BP faced brutal weather conditions on the North Slope of Alaska and said he did not know the details surrounding the recent power failure. But, he added, ''things like this should be dealt with pretty quickly, generally, or not even happen.''
 Mr. Beaudo said that the company was systematically removing the mud from the insulators and that the oil field would come online in phases, but he said he could not specify when production would be fully restored.
 ''It's going to take some time,'' he said. ''Don't know how long. We'll do it as quickly as we can. The emphasis is on safety.''
 The electrical system has been partially re-energized, Mr. Beaudo said, though that power has been devoted to its workers' living quarters.
 For unrelated reasons, the price of oil fell to its lowest level this year on Wednesday.
 Crude oil futures have plunged by more than $20 a barrel since mid-July amid rising global inventories, concerns about slowing economic growth and a milder-than-anticipated hurricane season. On Wednesday, doubts grew that there was a consensus within OPEC for an immediate cut in output, sending oil futures down to $57.59 a barrel.
 The Prudhoe Bay field covers 3,336 square miles. Alaska's three major oil companies --BP, ConocoPhillips and the Exxon Mobil Corporation -- own 98 percent of the field. 
 Most of the electricity at Prudhoe Bay comes from a natural-gas-fired turbine that produces 168 megawatts of power. The system has 13 substations and miles of power lines.
 The system shorted just before 3 a.m. Tuesday. Wind gusts peaked at 66 miles per hour midday Monday, according to the National Weather Service.
 Cleanup plans call for crews in helicopters to use a hot water solution from the air to wash the ceramic insulators. Trying to power up too quickly could cause the entire system to short out again, Mr. Beaudo said.

HEADLINE: North Korea Warns of More Nuclear Tests

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI; Warren Hoge contributed reporting from the United Nations.

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
North Korea said Wednesday that it would consider sanctions a ''declaration of a war'' and vowed to carry out further nuclear tests if the United States maintained a ''hostile attitude.'' The North seems to be following a clear strategy that experts say has allowed it, a small, isolated, nearly bankrupt nation, to keep the attention of the United States for more than a decade.
 In the country's first remarks since its reported nuclear test on Monday, North Korea said it felt compelled to prove its nuclear capacity to ''protect its sovereignty and right to existence from the daily increasing danger of war'' from the United States.
North Korea's official news agency quoted an unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying, ''If the U.S. increases pressure on North Korea, persistently doing harm to it, it will continue to take physical countermeasures, considering it as a declaration of a war.'' 
 This characteristically defiant tone was sounded as the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council prepared to discuss what type of sanctions to mete out.
 In a rare interview, Kim Yong-nam, the North's second most powerful leader, said, ''The issue of future nuclear tests is linked to U.S. policy toward our country.''
 ''If the United States continues to take a hostile attitude and apply pressure on us in various forms,'' Mr. Kim told a Japanese news agency, ''we will have no choice but to take physical steps to deal with that.''
 At the United Nations, ambassadors from Britain, China, France, Russia, the United States and Japan met to settle differences over a resolution to impose sanctions on North Korea. Ambassador John R. Bolton said the United States intended to circulate a revised draft Thursday in the hope of having a vote by Friday.
 The United States is seeking international inspections of all cargo into and out of North Korea to intercept weapons-related material and a resolution drafted under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter that poses the possibility of military enforcement. China and Russia are resisting that, though they say they favor strict punishments for North Korea's defiance of Council warnings not to conduct weapons tests. 
 Secretary General Kofi Annan called the apparent nuclear test ''unacceptable'' and said he expected the Council to take ''a firm action. 
 Asked whether the United States should deal directly with North Korea, Mr. Annan said: ''I have always argued that we should talk to parties whose behavior we want to change, whose behavior we want to influence. And from that point of view, I believe that the U.S. and North Korea should talk. They did talk in the past.''
 That may well be North Korea's aim. Despite a carefully cultivated reputation as a volatile, capricious leader, Kim Jong-il has pursued a consistent, even canny, strategy in his pursuit of nuclear arms.
 As Kim Yong-nam's remarks indicate, North Korea -- an increasingly isolated country that has battled famine, a collapsing economy and desertion across its borders -- has seen nuclear weapons as a form of defense as well as a potential threat. Its leaders have used that threat as way to wrest concessions from Western powers, and gain protection against what they see as hostile nations determined to topple their government. 
 North Korea embarked on this course in 1993, when it announced that it was pulling out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and then won an agreement from the Clinton administration for help in building two nuclear power reactors in exchange for freezing its nuclear activities. Over the ensuing years, despite disastrous economic conditions that led to famine in the mid- to late-1990's, the North succeeded in getting the world's attention through a series of crises of its own making, from declarations that it had nuclear weapons to missile launchings.
 ''Every time they've played this crisis escalation strategy with us before, it's worked,'' said Scott Snyder, a Korea expert with the Asia Foundation in Washington and the author of ''Negotiating on the Edge: North Korean Negotiating Behavior.''
 ''The mind-set was that if you're a small state like North Korea and there are many other problems in the world, the only way to get the United States' attention is to escalate things in such a way as to force the Bush administration to deal with North Korea directly,'' he said.
 Joining the club of nuclear powers was in keeping with North Korea's strategy to be treated on equal terms with Washington, Mr. Snyder said.
 The North made its intentions explicit in March 2005 declaring that, as a nuclear power, it wanted the six-nation talks over its nuclear program to focus instead on ''disarmament talks where participants can solve the issue on an equal basis.''
 The nuclear test was also the product of North Korea's sense of insecurity -- one that grew keener over the past decade because of its troubled economy and the leadership's inability to control a population that began spilling out, by tens of thousands, across the border into China and some to South Korea. In the past few years, as North Korea began liberalizing its economy and trade boomed with China, new threats of money-making and corruption materialized. 
 Many North Koreans still depend on international food aid because of the collapse of the state's food rationing system, though life is less precarious than in the 1990's. Those living near the porous border with China, and even those in remote areas, have increasing access to information from the outside world and contact with it.
 At the same time, the North is confronted by a Bush administration that described its leader, Kim Jong-il, as a ''pygmy'' and lumped it into an ''axis of evil.'' The toppling of Saddam Hussein magnified the threat.
 ''The nuclear test is a response to the threat that North Korea feels,'' said Bruce Cumings, a professor of history at the University of Chicago and an expert on North Korea. ''It's entirely real. It's not a figment of their imagination. They were put in the axis of evil. We have nuclear weapons pointed at them, and we have for decades.''
 North Korea is ''a garrison state of astonishing proportions,'' he said. ''It's not going to commit suicide by attacking South Korea or Japan with nuclear bombs. It knows it will lose. Their fundamental orientation is being hunkered down for defense.''
 The test, experts said, also grew out of the North's frustrations at the stalled six-nation talks and what it perceived as the Bush administration's reluctance to engage in genuine negotiations. Last year, the United States offered security and economic incentives in return for the North's freezing of its nuclear program, but the deal quickly fell apart over its sequence. What is more, Washington imposed economic sanctions around the same time, leading the North to withdraw from the talks.
 ''North Korea has nothing to show for its diplomatic efforts,'' said Peter Beck, the Northeast Asia project director at the International Crisis Group, adding that North Korea had also engaged in recent years in fruitless diplomacy with Japan and Europe. ''That makes the military perspective much more appealing.''
 But for North Korea's closest neighbors, experts said, its leverage comes from its weakness. For South Korea and China, the prospects of the North's collapse and a flood of refugees, as well as the possibility of an even more intractable successor to Mr. Kim, are perhaps even more worrisomedevelopments than nuclear weapons.
 In recent days, President Roh Moo-hyun of South Korea has indicated a willingness to be tough on the North by casting doubts about the South's policy of engaging North Korea. He suspended aid and said the two major projects -- industrial and tourist zones operated by South Koreans inside the North -- would be put under review. But it is not clear how long the tough stance will last.
 ''We're under a lot of pressure both domestically and internationally to give up on engagement,'' said a senior South Korean official. ''But we really don't have an alternative other than the engagement policy.''

HEADLINE: Less Aid for Colombian States Rich in Coca

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SAN JOSE DEL FRAGUA, Colombia, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
A $4 billion battle to wean Colombian farmers off the cocaine trade through a combination of military might and American aid is quietly being cut back in a region where cocaine production is surging. 
 In an internal memo, the United States Agency for International Development cites unacceptable security risks for its workers and a lack of private investment partners for its pullout from Caqueta State.
Six years and more than $4 billion in American tax dollars after Plan Colombia began in Caqueta, coca, the raw ingredient of cocaine, is still the region's No. 1 cash crop. But the programs meant to provide farmers with a profitable alternative to growing coca are vanishing.
 Washington spends $70 million annually on development projects in drug-producing areas of Colombia. But under the Agency for International Development's new five-year, $350 million plan for development projects, Caqueta and four other Amazonian states where coca production is rising will not receive a penny.
 ''Instead of investing generously to eliminate dependency on the illegal drug trade, we're being shunned,'' said Luis Fernando Almario, a congressman from Caqueta.
 An official at the United States Embassy in Bogota said resources from Caqueta would be redirected to areas with a greater likelihood of sustaining development.

HEADLINE: Shares Are Broadly Lower; Talk of Rate Cut Is Damped

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks fell for the first time in three days yesterday after Alcoa had begun the quarterly earnings season by missing analysts' estimates and Federal Reserve meeting minutes discouraged speculation that interest rates would begin dropping.
 Alcoa shares fell, along with those of Monsanto, the largest maker of genetically modified seeds, whose profit also trailed forecasts.
A long-term view was articulated by Rudolph-Riad Younes, who helps manage $40 billion as head of international equities at Julius Baer Investment Management in New York. ''The question you have to ask yourself is whether profits are sustainable,'' he said. ''I tend to believe earnings will revert back to the historical average. If that's the case, it's going to be bad for stocks.'' 
 Stocks slid after the minutes of the Fed rate-setting panel's meeting on Sept. 20 showed that members foresaw a ''substantial risk'' that price rises might not slow as expected. 
 The Dow Jones industrials dropped 15.04 points yesterday, or 0.13 percent, to 11,852.13. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 3.47 points, or 0.26 percent, to 1,349.95. The Nasdaq composite index fell 7.16 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,308.27. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization stocks fell 4.17 points, or 0.56 percent, to 741.71.
 Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange surpassed those advancing by about 3 to 2. Volume was 1.59 billion shares, up from 1.50 billion on Tuesday. 
 Lingering concern about North Korea's nuclear test seemed to be weighing on some investors' minds. President Bush, in an extended session with reporters in Washington, resisted calls for direct negotiations with North Korea of the sort the Clinton administration engaged in, saying ''the strategy did not work.''
 Exxon Mobil and other energy companies were the worst performers yesterday among S.& P. 500 industry groups as the price of crude oil declined to $57.59 a barrel.
 Also yesterday, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Jeffrey M. Lacker, said the Fed must remain ''quite vigilant'' to make sure that inflation slows.
 And Anita Clemons, who manages $1.4 billion at New Covenant Trust in Jeffersonville, Ind., added, ''Investors are concerned about the Fed going from a position of possibly cutting rates to now raising rates, a couple of disappointing earnings reports and North Korea.'' 
 Alcoa lost $1.44, or 5.1 percent, to $26.85. Its net income last quarter, reported sharply higher on Tuesday at 61 cents a share, was nonetheless below the 78-cent estimate of some analysts.
 J. P. Morgan reduced its 2006 estimate of Alcoa's earnings per share to $2.92 from $3.32 and its 2007 estimate to $2.50 from $3.25.
 Monsanto fell $2.46, or 5.3 percent, to $43.95. Its loss widened to 27 cents a share in the fiscal fourth quarter. Analysts had expected a loss of 21 cents. Monsanto also projected profit per share next year of $1.50 to $1.57, below analysts' estimates of $1.62.
 Among the big oil companies, Exxon Mobil fell 67 cents, to $66.53. Chevron closed down 80 cents, at $63.10. Energy shares tumbled 1.3 percent among S.& P. 500 groups.
 In the bond market yesterday, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 6/32, to 100 24/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.78 percent from 4.75 percent.
 The following is the result of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price -- 99.627
High Rate -- 4.785
Coupon Yield -- 4.870
Low Rate -- 4.710
Median Rate -- 4.755
Total applied for -- $26,509,403
Accepted -- $11,889,153
Noncompetitive -- $309,886

YOUTUBE FOUNDER'S JACKPOT -- Jawed Karim -- who hit an Internet jackpot in 2002 when PayPal, the online payment company he had joined early on, was bought by eBay -- hit the equivalent of the PowerBall this week when YouTube, which he helped to found, agreed to be bought by Google for $1.65 billion. [C1.]

CELEBRITIES FLOCK TO TV ADS -- Advertising agencies say they are finding more, and better, choices among celebrities for their television ad campaigns, as television spots are increasingly seen as a good promotional vehicle for other projects. Advertising. [C1.]

RELUCTANCE TO LOWER RATES -- Despite indications that inflation pressures may be starting to ease, the Federal Reserve is not inclined to lower short-term interest rates anytime soon, minutes from its most recent meeting show. [C1.]

BUSINESS LEADERS AND SPITZER -- In the race for governor of New York, some business leaders, rather than viewing Eliot Spitzer's battles with Wall Street as noble or civic minded, see a gigantic, calculating ego run amok. Mr. Spitzer is unapologetic, saying the way to strengthen business is by keeping it honest. [A1.]

SECOND DREAMWORKS OFFERING -- The investment firm owned by Paul G. Allen, below, the co-founder of Microsoft, said it had exercised an option to force DreamWorks Animation to sell part of his stake in the company to the public in a secondary offering.

HEADLINE: A Company Researching Cleaner Fuels Draws Backers

BYLINE: By PETER EDMONSTON

 BODY:
Oil prices may be falling, but venture capitalists continue to see green -- in both senses of the word -- in the business of finding cleaner and more environmentally friendly energy sources. 
 The latest example is Amyris Biotechnologies, a start-up whose focus until recently has been using microbes to produce an antimalarial drug.
Amyris is expected to announce today that it has secured $20 million in financing from a group, including Khosla Ventures, the venture firm led by the Sun Microsystems co-founder Vinod Khosla. 
 With its new money, Amyris hopes to adapt its microbes to produce a molecule similar to that in ethanol, a plant-derived fuel that can be mixed with gasoline, said John Melo, a former BP executive who is joining Amyris as its chief executive. 
 The venture financing is the first for Amyris, which has 41 employees. Previously, the firm relied on grants from organizations, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
 Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the Silicon Valley venture firm where Mr. Khosla was once a partner, and the venture arm of the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group are also investing in Amyris. 
 John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins, Samir Kaul of Khosla Ventures and Geoffrey Duyk of Texas Pacific Group Ventures will also be joining the board of Amyris. 
 Mr. Khosla's firm is just one of many that have invested in companies that improve energy sources or provide alternative ones, a category known as cleantech. Businesses related to ethanol, which is seen by many as a fuel that could rapidly displace gasoline, have been an especially big draw.
 The private investment firm of Bill Gates, Cascade Investment, paid $84 million in April for preferred convertible shares of Pacific Ethanol, a publicly traded ethanol producer. Sir Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Group, plans to invest $3 billion over the next 10 years in alternative energy enterprises.
 After flaring white-hot over the summer, however, enthusiasm for ethanol-related businesses has cooled, in large part because the economics of ethanol is less compelling than it was six months ago when oil prices were higher.
 Mr. Khosla said he welcomed a pullback in what he called a speculative rush to embrace ethanol-related stocks. ''It was getting heated, and I'm glad to see it moderate to more reasonable levels,'' he said.
 Shares of two ethanol makers, VeraSun Energy and Aventine Renewable Energy, have declined sharply since they had initial public offerings within a few weeks of each other this summer.
 Hawkeye Holdings, another ethanol maker, postponed its planned initial public offerings last month citing ''current conditions in the equity markets and the recent pullback in the energy segment in particular.'' Hawkeye originally filed for the stock offering on May 30, less than a month after the private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners agreed to acquire 80 percent of Hawkeye in a deal that valued the company at about $1 billion.

HEADLINE: Insurers Get An Earful From Senator

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Sometimes, political connections come in handy. Ask Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi. 
 Mr. Lott, a Republican and former majority leader, is one of thousands of homeowners on the Gulf Coast who have been fighting with their insurers over payments for damage in Hurricane Katrina. In an interview yesterday, he said he was angry about the insurers' ''insensitivity and outright meanness'' in rejecting many homeowners' claims.
He said he inserted a provision into legislation, signed by President Bush last week, directing the Department of Homeland Security to investigate potential fraud by the insurance industry. Mr. Lott said he was also drafting legislation to challenge the industry's exemptions from antitrust laws and had asked his staff to investigate the industry's tax rates. 
 ''I am outraged,'' he said. ''I'm concerned there are lots of abuses in the aftermath of the hurricane.''
 Mr. Lott's claim for the loss of his $400,000 house in Pascagoula was rejected by State Farm.
 Industry executives and lawyers denied that the insurers had engaged in fraud and some questioned whether Mr. Lott was improperly using his position in Congress.
 ''Given that the senator has a personal dog in the fight, his actions have the appearance of an abuse of power,'' said Randy J. Maniloff, a lawyer in Philadelphia who represents insurance companies. 
 Mr. Lott said he was not acting solely out of personal motivation. ''I've had my own experience, but a lot of people have had similar experiences,'' Mr. Lott said. ''They have abused my people, my friends, the people I love.''
 Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York, said: ''It's unfortunate that the scarce resources of the Department of Homeland Security are being diverted toward an unjustified investigation.''
 The industry executives also asserted that Mr. Lott, as a senator, had a duty to be impartial. They said he should follow the example of several judges in Mississippi whose homes were damaged in Katrina and who have recused themselves from cases involving the storm. 
 ''I don't profess to be impartial,'' Mr. Lott said. 
 Mr. Lott said he was also planning to introduce legislation requiring the insurers to include in their policies a prominent listing in plain English of what they refuse to cover. He said home insurance policies contained ''a bunch of subterfuges'' difficult for laymen or lawyers to comprehend. ''Don't tell me they don't do it on purpose,'' Mr. Lott said.
 Insurance is mainly regulated by the states. But the federal government has authority on antitrust and tax issues. The insurers have been exempted from some antitrust laws since the 1940's. These exemptions permit them to share industrywide information on claims costs and project future costs. 
 The insurers say working with a larger pool of data than any single company could develop enables them to offer lower prices. J. Robert Hunter, an insurance expert at the Consumer Federation of America, said that without the antitrust exemption, insurance prices would probably be lower.
 Mr. Lott told The National Underwriter, an insurance industry publication, that he spoke directly to Edward B. Rust Jr., the chief executive of State Farm. ''He said he would look into my situation,'' Mr. Lott was quoted in January as saying. ''I told him I didn't want any special consideration. I wanted them to do what was right for everybody.''
 State Farm and other insurers promise to pay for wind damage in hurricanes but they say their policies do not pay for flood damage. Federal flood insurance pays up to $250,000 in damage to a home and up to $100,000 for furnishings and clothing. 
 Mr. Lott and several thousand other Mississippi homeowners are suing State Farm and other insurers, arguing that the winds of Katrina pushed floodwaters across the beaches and that the policies they bought that promise coverage against wind damage should be honored. 
 State Farm declined yesterday to discuss Mr. Lott's lawsuit. Insurers have paid $41 billion for damage to homes and businesses from Hurricane Katrina, $13.6 billion in Mississippi alone, resolving, they say, 95 percent of the state's 355,000 homeowner claims.
 Mr. Lott said he bought flood insurance and received the maximum of $350,000 from the government. Industry executives say Mr. Lott clearly understood that flood insurance and private homeowners insurance provide separate coverage. 
 Mr. Lott's lawyer is Richard F. Scruggs, who made a fortune in litigation against tobacco companies. Mr. Scruggs, who is representing many Katrina victims, is Mr. Lott's brother-in-law and a neighbor in Pascagoula. Mr. Scruggs's home was heavily damaged. John Griffin Jones, a lawyer working with Mr. Scruggs on claims, said an insurer also denied Mr. Scruggs's claim. 
 In August, Judge L. T. Senter Jr. of Federal District Court in Gulfport ruled in the first trial over wind versus water damage that the insurers did not have to pay for flood damage. But he said language permitting them to refuse payment when damage results from a combination of wind and water was ambiguous. 
 Mr. Lott said he had sought the Homeland Security investigation because he believed that the insurers shifted the cost of many claims to the federal flood insurance program that they should have paid themselves. 
 Mr. Lott said he wanted Homeland Security to determine if the shifting of costs to the federal program ''was just an occasional mistake or systematic.''
 ''I think it was systematic,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Japanese Back New Leader In Handling of Nuclear Crisis

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
In office three weeks, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is facing his first crisis, North Korea's claimed nuclear test, with a mix of soothing diplomacy and tough sanctions, scoring high marks with his nation's anxious voters.
 Mr. Abe has called on the United Nations to punish North Korea, and on Wednesday his government announced its own sanctions, including a ban on imports. At the same time, he has shown greater flexibility than his predecessor toward China and South Korea, joining them in criticizing the North during hastily arranged summit meetings this week.
Mr. Abe, who rose to popularity by taking a hard line on North Korea, has used the crisis to showcase his more assertive brand of foreign policy. He and other conservatives have used the North Korea threat to advance long-held goals of rearming their nation and giving it an international voice more in line with its economic might. 
 So far, Mr. Abe's blend of nationalist appeals and diplomatic pragmatism has proved popular with the Japanese public, which greeted the North's test announcement with outrage and fear. An editorial in Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a leading daily, compared the level of shock here to that after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.
 An opinion poll of voters published Wednesday in Asahi Shimbun, another leading daily, indicated 83 percent approved of Mr. Abe's visits to Beijing and Seoul, which were arranged before the crisis. The poll, of 1,023 people contacted by telephone, showed 82 percent seeing the North as a threat, a boon for Mr. Abe, whom the poll gave an approval rating of 63 percent.
 ''For now, the North Korea crisis has put the wind at Mr. Abe's back,'' said Hiroshi Nakanishi, a professor of international politics at Kyoto University. ''His longstanding position of putting pressure on North Korea makes him look good at the moment.''
 But Mr. Nakanishi and other analysts also point out that Japan's deep-seated problems with the rest of Asia remain unresolved. The biggest is the belief among former victims of Japanese World War II-era aggression that Tokyo remains unrepentant about its wartime deeds.
 In particular, Mr. Abe has remained purposefully vague on whether he will visit the Yasukuni Shrine, a Shinto memorial that honors Japan's war dead, including executed war criminals. His predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, insisted on paying annual visits, outraging China and South Korea.
 For now, Seoul and Beijing seem to accept Mr. Abe's stance of not stating whether he will go to the shrine. But if he should respond to pressures from his political base on Japan's right and pay a visit, he risks undoing his progress in mending ties, analysts say.
 Mr. Abe has been sending mixed signals about his views on Japan's war responsibility. In Parliament last week he said wartime leaders, including his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, then the munitions minister, had made a mistake in going to war. But he also questioned the rulings of the United States-led Tokyo War Crimes trials after Japan's defeat.
 His avowed goal of revising Japan's pacifist Constitution to allow full-fledged armed forces has also stirred regional concerns of resurgent militarism.
 So far, though, such issues have been overshadowed by North Korea's reported nuclear test, an opportunity Mr. Abe has seized. In Parliament on Wednesday he called the test unacceptable, saying it was Japan that ''faced the biggest threat from North Korea,'' which is about 200 miles away. His tough stance has led many here to call him Japan's ''fighting prime minister.''
 On Wednesday, Japan imposed economic sanctions, including a ban on North Korean ships in Japanese harbors and greater restrictions on visits by North Korean citizens, in addition to the ban on imports. There has also been talk of tougher steps, like Japanese warships joining with the United States fleet if a naval blockade is imposed on North Korea.
 At the same time, Mr. Abe has seen the crisis as a chance to improve ties with China and South Korea, both increasingly important trading partners. In Seoul on Monday, he appeared with the South Korean president, Roh Moo-hyun, to condemn the North's test. A day earlier he met with China's president, Hu Jintao, during the first visit to Beijing by a Japanese prime minister in five years.
 Mr. Abe has also appealed to voters with his vision of a more equal military alliance with the United States, Japan's postwar protector. He has said he wants to increase Japan's participation in the United States-led development of a missile shield. 
 Analysts said his efforts at reconciliation with Seoul and Beijing might also have been made with an eye on Washington. American officials have shown concern over Japan's growing isolation in East Asia because of Yasukuni and other issues, including territorial disputes.
 ''The Yasukuni problem is on the shelf for now, but it will come back to plague Mr. Abe,'' said Mr. Nakanishi of Kyoto University. ''Future tensions with South Korea and China are almost unavoidable.''

HEADLINE: As the Foley Case Unfolds, Hastert Gets a More Enthusiastic Nod From Bush 

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
Early last week, President Bush said he respected J. Dennis Hastert as a father, a teacher and a coach -- but did not say what he thought of him as House speaker. 
 Two days later, amid continuing calls for Mr. Hastert to resign as speaker over the Mark Foley e-mail scandal, Mr. Bush expressed more direct support for Mr. Hastert, but only through aides.
This week, Mr. Bush is giving Mr. Hastert a more unmistakable embrace, telling reporters on Wednesday: ''Denny is very credible, as far as I'm concerned. And he's done a fine job as speaker.'' 
 The president is expected go one step further on Thursday, when he is scheduled to appear side-by-side with Mr. Hastert at a Republican rally in Chicago.
 Aides to both men said Mr. Bush's ever-friendlier declarations of support were one part political calculus, one part personal loyalty. The White House has made clear it agrees with Republican leaders in Congress that Mr. Hastert's resignation would only prompt Democrats to demand more scalps in the imbroglio over what Congressional Republicans knew when about Mr. Foley's risque e-mails to male pages.
 But, aides said, it also reflects Mr. Bush's belief that Mr. Hastert has by and large been a loyal supporter who has come through for him at crucial moments -- though their working relationship has had its rifts. This year, Mr. Hastert has criticized the administration for approving a deal giving control of operations at several major ports to a Dubai-owned company and for pushing an immigration plan that caused open rebellion among his members.
 The strains seemed evident last week as Mr. Bush initially appeared to hold back on giving Mr. Hastert full-throated support as speaker, though aides said the president could only come so far when so many facts were unknown.
 But then last Thursday, Mr. Hastert declared that he took ultimate responsibility for his office's missing signals that Mr. Foley was crossing the line with pages -- though he said he had not personally known of them. This seemed to clear the way for more forceful presidential support.
 Within hours, Mr. Bush called Mr. Hastert at home to say he stood by him as speaker. Aides to both men told reporters about the call minutes later.
 People in Mr. Hastert's inner circle describe the phone call as the equivalent of a papal blessing that helped cool demands for his resignation from within the party, even as new reports emerged accusing Mr. Hastert's office of knowing about potential trouble with Mr. Foley earlier than it had acknowledged.
 Addressing some friction this year, Ron Bonjean, Mr. Hastert's spokesman, said, ''Sure, there have been ups and downs, but at the same time we both have our eye on the ball and we both are trying to defy history in this midterm election.'' 
 Aides to Mr. Bush said the president was also grateful for Mr. Hastert's help on signature issues like his tax cuts. Mr. Bush had urged the speaker to stay on in 2004, to help advance his second-term agenda. Otherwise, Mr. Hastert's associates say, he would now be savoring an ambassadorship or concentrating on building a vacation home in Wisconsin. 
 In the end, Mr. Hastert could not help the president deliver his proposed Social Security overhaul or his immigration plan. But Tony Snow, the White House press secretary, said the president had appreciated Mr. Hastert's candor.
 ''Sometimes Hastert will say 'I agree with you, but given where the votes are, you're not going to get it,' '' Mr. Snow said.
 Only weeks ago, Illinois Republicans worried about having Mr. Bush attend a fund-raiser for local Congressional candidates on Thursday, given his approval ratings. Mr. Hastert's name was highlighted on the invitations, printed larger than Mr. Bush's. 
 Now, it is Mr. Hastert who is seen as the bigger liability. And now it is Mr. Bush who is trying to boost Mr. Hastert. 
 ''When he stands up and says, I want to know the truth -- I believe yesterday he said that if somebody on his staff didn't tell him the truth, they're gone -- I respect that and appreciate that, and believe him,'' Mr. Bush said Wednesday.
 The president predicted that the scandal would not harm the party on Election Day.
 ''This Foley issue bothers a lot of people, including me,'' he said. ''But I think when they get in that booth, they're going to be thinking about how best to secure the country from attack, and how best to keep the economy growing.''

President Bush said that he would not use force against North Korea because ''diplomacy hasn't run its course,'' but acknowledged that many Americans wonder why he invaded Iraq but has not taken military action to head off the North's race for a bomb.

HEADLINE: President Sees Signs Favoring G.O.P. Victory

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
President Bush predicted on Wednesday that Republicans would be victorious in November, declaring that positive economic signs, combined with tough rhetoric against Democrats on national security, would help lift his party on Election Day.
 Mr. Bush made his prediction at a news conference in the Rose Garden at which he promoted new figures from the Treasury Department showing that the federal budget deficit had dropped sharply from last year, to its lowest level in four years, on stronger-than-expected revenues. The event gave the president a chance to call attention to his party's election-year message on the economy, which has largely been drowned out by other news this summer and fall.
''We'll have a Republican speaker and a Republican leader of the Senate, and the reason I say that is because I believe the two biggest issues in this campaign are, one, the economy and the economy is growing,'' Mr. Bush said during the hourlong briefing in the Rose Garden. (The other major campaign issue, he said later, was national security.) 
 The Treasury Department reported that its preliminary data for the fiscal year 2006, which ended Sept. 30, showed that the federal budget deficit was $248 billion, down from $319 billion in 2005. 
 Mr. Bush said the new data showed that his administration had succeeded, three years ahead of time, in fulfilling his promise in 2004 to cut the deficit in half by 2009 and underscored the success of his tax cuts. But that promise was based on a projected 2004 deficit of $521 billion; the deficit that year was actually $413 billion.
 Democrats continue to press attacks against Mr. Bush and Republicans on the economy, saying Mr. Bush's claim is based on an ''artificially inflated'' projected deficit and arguing that trouble lies ahead because of Mr. Bush's tax cuts, the cost of the war in Iraq and baby boomer retirements.
 Still, the new data provided an opportunity to direct attention to positive economic news -- and away from news reports about the Mark Foley scandal involving Congressional pages, casualties in Iraq and declining Republican electoral prospects in November. Administration officials said there was no disputing that they had hit the target deficit of less than $260 billion, three years early. 
 Officials have complained in recent weeks that they have been unable to draw attention to their arguments on the economy even though gasoline prices have dropped.
 Mr. Bush used the occasion of the deficit announcement to pivot against the Democrats, saying that if they were to win control of Congress they would end his tax cuts and economic growth along with them.
 ''Democrats will raise taxes,'' he said. ''Now, I know they say only on rich people, but that's in my judgment -- having been around here long enough to know -- it's just code word: They're going to raise them on whoever they can raise them on.''
 In keeping with a Democratic promise to respond to all Republican attacks, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip, hit back with a statement pointing to the $8.5 trillion national debt and Republican votes to raise the debt ceiling. 
 ''The fact is,'' Mr. Hoyer said, ''this is the most fiscally irresponsible administration in American history.''
 At his news conference, Mr. Bush said he would welcome such debates, which tend to provide opportunities to go toe to toe over tax cuts. ''There's a difference of opinion in the campaign about taxes,'' he said, ''and we will keep them low.''
 Mr. Bush also used the briefing to repeat his attacks on Democrats for, he said, trying to stand in the way of provisions that would give him more latitude to pursue terrorists.
 ''The vast majority of Democrats in the House voted against a program that would have institutionalized the capacity of this government to listen to Al Qaeda phone calls or Al Qaeda affiliate phone calls coming from outside the country to inside the country,'' he said, referring to a bill to give Congressional approval to his program granting wiretaps to the authorities seeking terrorism suspects without warrants.
 Democrats have said that such statements mischaracterize their positions -- in this case to make it appear that they oppose efforts to listen to terrorists' phone calls, when what they oppose is trying to do so without warrants that they argue can be obtained quickly.

HEADLINE: 2008: The Prequel

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
There are always a lot of retirees at campaign events in places like Mansfield, Ohio, and the most telling question you can ask them is: Where are your kids living?
 Most of the factories have shut down in Mansfield. The old Westinghouse plant sits silent and archaic like a medieval castle near the center of town. And the retirees have seen their kids go off somewhere else. If they've gone to college, they're in New York, California, Georgia or Arizona. They're Christmas Ohioans. At holiday time they visit home.
 This is the economic backdrop to the most important political race in the country, the Senate campaign between Sherrod Brown, a Democrat now in the House, and Mike DeWine, the Republican incumbent. It's important because each candidate comes from the most vibrant strain in his own party. Brown is a full-bore economic populist. DeWine is an independent McCainiac conservative. In two years, the national parties will be talking in just these ways, and we're seeing a preview of that battle today. 
 Sherrod Brown is a natural political animal, with the ability to dominate the space around him. At a campaign rally in Mansfield, he pulls a chair into the center of the room while others are speaking, so everyone can see him listening and reacting. He wears a wrinkled, cheap suit, and his raspy voice and plain manners evoke the local diner or union hall more than his alma mater, Yale University.
 Terrorism and national security issues don't come up spontaneously around Brown. He focuses on the problem that is at the core of his career and mission: the hollowing out of Ohio's manufacturing base and the slow destruction of a way of life.
 ''They've sold out our country and betrayed the middle class,'' he says of the Republicans and the big corporations who worked together to write the tax laws, the energy bill and the prescription drug bill. 
 He vociferously opposes free trade. In his defining TV ad, he stands in front of a closed factory and blasts DeWine for supporting trade agreements that cost America jobs. His lapel pin shows a canary in a cage, a symbol of his solidarity with coal miners and workers everywhere. At a time when many Democrats are merely against things, Brown has a coherent approach to globalization and stagnant wages. 
 DeWine is Brown's opposite. He's short and unassuming, the least senatorial-looking man in the U.S. Senate. When he ambles modestly into a rally at Rocky River, almost nobody notices. As Tom Ridge, the former Pennsylvania governor, sings his praises, DeWine slips offstage to the back of the room. He grabs some chicken, finds a table and tucks meditatively into his dinner. Only one person at the table even looks up.
 And yet he's one of the toughest and most widely respected senators. Anti-abortion and pro-tax cut, he angered his evangelical base by supporting the Gang of 14 compromise on judicial filibusters. He voted against the president's last budget because he thought it had the wrong priorities on children's health (he lost a daughter in a car accident). On the stump he touts law after law he has co-sponsored with liberal Democrats. 
 He wasn't in Congress when Nafta passed, but he rattles off statistics on how many Ohio jobs derive from exports and global trade. If Ohio's going to rebound, he says, its going to come from skills and entrepreneurialism not trade protectionism.
 In a normal year, DeWine could probably hold off Brown's formidable challenge. DeWine, who is incapable of grandstanding, embodies the trans-partisan, conversational politics the country longs for.
 But this year he faces an uphill fight. Voter frustration with Republican rule blots out the distaste many may have for liberal Democrats. DeWine has tried to portray Brown as an out-of-step liberal, to little effect. 
 More important, President Bush's polarizing political strategy has made it hard for independent Republicans to distinguish themselves from their party's national brand. As the Catholic University political scientist John K. White points out, we seem to be amid a parliamentary election this year, with voters making decisions about national parties, not local candidates. There is a yawning 19-point gap between those who say they like DeWine personally and those who say they plan to vote for him. 
 Ohio is crucial to winning the presidency. If Brown wins this year, he'll be the model for Democrats nationally. If DeWine pulls this out, Republican will copy him. This is what politics looks like as conservatism wanes: feisty economic liberals against independent, party-bucking Republicans.

HEADLINE: The Blame Game On North Korea

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Instant Fallout for Politicians: Finger-Pointing'' (front page, Oct. 11):
With North Korea's detonation of a nuclear weapon, the world is confronted with a very serious and difficult problem. But on the American campaign trail, Republicans and Democrats aren't discussing solutions; they're trying to blame each other for the problem. 
 The politicians and candidates are worrying about which political party this development will benefit or hurt, not how we as a nation and a society should come to grips with the reality of nuclear proliferation.
 This is playground behavior, not political leadership.

Steve Frolking
Durham, N.H., Oct. 11, 2006

To the Editor:
 During former President Bill Clinton's last years in office, Republicans did everything they could to block any action he tried to take. Now, six years into a Republican administration, they are trying to blame him for the failure of the administration's policy on North Korea. You report (front page, Oct. 11) that Senator John McCain did so on Tuesday at an appearance in Michigan. 
 How long does an administration have to be in office to change the former administration's policies? With majorities in both houses, the Republicans should have been able to change the policies they now decry. 
 Their stated inability to do so exposes their ineptitude and hypocrisy. 
 North Korea may have been cheating on the agreement it had with the Clinton administration, but it was nowhere near producing a nuclear weapon at the time.
 The Bush administration's refusal to continue negotiations while making vague and unenforceable threats led us to the present impasse. To blame an administration that has been out of power for six years is preposterous.

To the Editor:
 Re ''Rice Asserts U.S. Plans No Attack on North Korea'' (front page, Oct. 11):
 More and more, it is obvious that this president and his administration have acted in a foolish and dangerous manner in pursuing a war in Iraq. North Korea could not have asked for a better scenario. 
 The United States is bogged down in a useless and expensive war in Iraq, which was proved to have no weapons of mass destruction. Now Washington is unable to respond in the strongest way to a real threat in North Korea. 
 North Korea appears to want to arm itself, along with perhaps the world's worst terrorists, with weapons of mass destruction, as the United States continues to slog through Iraq, to no perceivable purpose.
 I am appalled at the danger this president has put us in. Can anyone doubt that we are less safe than we were before President Bush took office?

Harriet Husbands
Seattle, Oct. 11, 2006

To the Editor:
 Recent discussion about how we will react to North Korea's apparent nuclear test seems to emphasize tightening embargoes and sanctions. 
 As Jimmy Carter points out (''Solving the Korean Stalemate, One Step at a Time,'' Op-Ed, Oct. 11), that would involve ''increasing the suffering of its already starving people.'' 
 In my view, that is immoral. I recognize that it is possible to morally justify immoral acts, but since there are moral alternatives (as described by former President Carter), a moral justification does not apply here.

HEADLINE: A Gilded Path to Political Stardom, With Detours

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
There could hardly be a more perfect road map to becoming a rich lawyer than the bullet points laid out on Eliot Spitzer's formidable resume. There was high school at prestigious Horace Mann, then Princeton and Harvard Law, followed by stints as a prosecutor for Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, and at top law firms like Paul, Weiss and Skadden, Arps. 
 But along the way, Eliot Spitzer would deviate from that gilded path: at age 20 and while still at Princeton, he set off for a summer in the Deep South to dig ditches and mop rooms at Georgia Tech, before going to pick tomatoes in upstate New York, a trip that he said ''opened my eyes into a part of life I hadn't seen.''
Fifteen years later, at age 35, he took the biggest gamble of his life, giving up his job as a corporate lawyer to run for New York attorney general, a bid many considered preposterous. 
 What his opponents did not count on were twin weapons in the Spitzer arsenal: a fearsome ambition to win, and the millions of dollars that his father, Bernard Spitzer, brought to bear on his son's early campaigns. 
 The money led to accusations, later dismissed by election officials, that Mr. Spitzer was circumventing campaign finance laws to buy the race.
 He finally prevailed in his second run, and would transform the position to take on corporate fraud and propel himself to national renown with his prosecutions of Wall Street investment firms and the insurance industry.
 Now, with a commanding lead in the polls in the race for governor, Mr. Spitzer stands at the brink of taking over a state government that is legendary for its dysfunction and backroom deal-making. 
 He has pledged to overhaul Albany much the same way he used his current job to expose corporate wrongdoing, telling Democrats after they nominated him, ''The crowd in charge in Albany is out of touch, out of ideas and, come Jan. 1, they'll be out of time,'' adding that ''on Day 1, everything changes.''
 His record as attorney general suggests he may have the relentless personality to bring change to the state capital. But his sharp-elbowed, smartest-man-in-the-room demeanor could also undermine his own agenda in Albany, a clubby place where slights have a years-long shelf life in the memories of lawmakers who jealously guard their power.
 For his own part, Mr. Spitzer says he is driven by the sort of Progressive impulse that fueled Theodore Roosevelt, whose picture hangs in his office. But when Roosevelt took on Albany after becoming governor in 1899, he was driven out of town by party bosses who persuaded William C. McKinley to put him on the ticket as his vice presidential candidate. 
 Mr. Spitzer is undeterred. ''You don't change the world by whispering,'' he often says.
 Some business leaders, rather than viewing his battles with Wall Street as noble or even civic minded, instead see a gigantic, calculating ego run amok. Mr. Spitzer is unapologetic, saying the way to strengthen business is by keeping it honest. ''I'm here to protect the true competitors,'' he says, in the way Roosevelt wanted ''a square deal'' both for citizens and business. He also cites Alexander Hamilton, a chief architect of American capitalism, as another political role model.
 Not a moving orator, Mr. Spitzer is a loud one, exuding a prosecutorial demeanor reinforced by his chiseled chin and steely blue eyes. His off-the-cuff remarks veer from sizzling bluntness -- like calling the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan an ''Enron-style debacle'' -- to impenetrable policy whirlwinds spruced with words like ''promulgate'' and ''out-migration.''
 Mr. Spitzer brings edgy confidence to all his endeavors, a trait to be expected from a home that produced a neurosurgeon brother and a sister who is a lawyer. At the center of it all were parents who fostered intellectual probing and social awareness, and who follow their son to this day on the campaign trail as he seeks to return the Democrats to the Governor's Mansion after 12 years of exile.

His Father's Son
 Dinner at the Spitzer household was more like a bout of intellectual pyrotechnics, visitors recalled. Bernard Spitzer, who built a real estate empire worth several hundred million dollars from scratch, had his three children bring weighty topics to the dinner table for rollicking discussions.
 ''He would ask, 'How thick is the Earth's crust?''' recalled Joey Low, a childhood friend of Eliot's. ''And each one of them gave an answer, and Bernie would look at them and see if their answer was up to par.''
 ''He expected a lot from all of their kids and they produced,'' he added.
 Bernard, now 82, is the son of Austrian immigrants who came to the country in the 1920's. His is a classic immigrant rags-to-riches story, having grown up on the Lower East Side in railroad flats with no hot water. He met his future wife, the former Anne Goldhaber, now 78 and a former teacher, at a Catskill resort. 
 Bernard graduated from City College at 18 with a degree in engineering. When he returned from his World War II service in the Navy, he got work as a contractor and then eventually struck out on his own, building a real estate empire that now includes several high-rise apartment buildings on the East Side of Manhattan, including the 57-story Corinthian in Murray Hill. 
 ''The philosophy of my own life was imparted by me to my children,'' he said. ''I wanted to do something that would interest me and I didn't want to abhor going to work in the morning.''
 Of his father, the younger Mr. Spitzer said, ''There is a little bit of what I guess would traditionally be called a Germanic nature to him, but also a really good sense of humor. But there isn't a lot of tolerance just for wasted time and such, so we didn't sit around the dinner table talking about the weather and gossip.''
 If his parents imbued him with a sense of intellectual purpose, it seemed to strike some as wonkish. Jason Brown, a friend and now a lawyer at Ropes & Gray, recalls running against Eliot for the presidency of Horace Mann's seventh-grade class.
 ''My campaign winning slogan was, ''Don't be a dope when things are down, there's still hope if you vote for Brown,'' he recalled with a laugh. ''That clever rhyme beat out Eliot's economic platform.''
 Eliot was something of a jock at Horace Mann, captaining the tennis team and playing soccer. When his teams played Trinity, he crossed paths with John McEnroe, who plays tennis with the same abrasive intensity with which Mr. Spitzer approaches politics. Mr. Spitzer has often told the story of going home after seeing Mr. McEnroe whiz serves past one of his classmates and telling his parents ''I had seen the kid play who would be No. 1 in the world.''
 ''My parents said, 'Eliot, just because he beat you doesn't mean that he's the best in the world,'' he remembered.
 Along the way, Eliot suffered setbacks, or what for him counted as setbacks. His ambitions of going to Harvard were derailed when he was not accepted, so he went to Princeton instead. In an interview, his father also let forth a family secret: that his son had scored a perfect 1,600 on the SAT. Confronted with this, Mr. Spitzer winced, and conceded imperfection.
 ''I think it was 1,590,'' he said, adding that his father must have confused the SAT with his perfect LSAT score.
 At Princeton, he was very much the same precocious and confident person, elected president of the student body -- as a sophomore. 
 ''I remember -- I still bust his chops for this -- it was sophomore year and we were walking back to our dorm, Holder Hall, and he said, 'That's a remarkable fenestration,''' said William Taylor, a college friend. ''And I had no idea what that meant. His father is a builder, so maybe that's a term of art. Yes, he has a very wide-ranging vocabulary.'' (Fenestration is, according to Merriam-Webster, ''the arrangement, proportioning, and design of windows and doors in a building.)

Him, a Politician?
 Twenty-three years ago, two Harvard Law students were wandering through a gay bathhouse in Boston with their professor. The men were meeting with the bathhouse operator, who claimed to have information relating to drug deliveries made to the house of Sunny von Bulow, a socialite who had gone into a coma, and whose second husband, Claus, had recently been convicted of trying to murder her.
 ''If my mother and father knew what kind of education their tuition was buying, they'd transfer me to business school,'' one of the students said, according to the book ''Reversal of Fortune,'' while the other replied, ''If they saw the number of business school graduates that are clients here, they'd send you to divinity school.''
 One of the students was Eliot Spitzer, and the other was Cliff Sloan, now the publisher of Slate. Mr. Spitzer's professor, Alan Dershowitz, was handling Claus von Bulow's appeal, and was the author of ''Reversal of Fortune.'' 
 Mr. Spitzer's involvement in the case showed how he had a knack for good timing, finding himself a ringside seat on one of the most publicized cases of the day. But his name does not even appear in Mr. Dershowitz's book, and young Eliot's role was supplanted in the film version by more comely legal assistants played by Annabella Sciorra and Felicity Huffman. 
 And that was the role many of his friends thought Eliot would play -- brilliant, talented, but not necessarily the guy in front of the cameras. 
 ''He was just off-the-charts brilliant,'' Mr. Dershowitz said recently, but added, ''The last thing anyone in my office thought was that he was going to become a politician.''
 Mr. Spitzer agreed. 
 ''I didn't think I was well suited to it,'' he said of the political life. ''When I say that to people now, they say, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah,' because they say you were student body president of Princeton, which is obviously true, but it really is the case,'' he added. 
 He saw himself as ''an assistant secretary of this, that or the other thing, because I love the policy.'' But in his later campaigns for office, he was known to methodically build ties to key reporters and power players in the state capital, suggesting a good political instinct.
 It was while attending Harvard that Eliot Spitzer also met his future wife, Silda Wall, on a skiing trip to Vermont. Mr. Spitzer and Silda would date for several years, in both Boston and New York, before getting married. In New York in the mid-1980's, Silda worked far longer hours at Skadden, Arps than he did clerking for Robert Sweet, a federal district court judge. She now runs a charity that encourages children to volunteer.
 Mr. Spitzer is Jewish, but his parents were not particularly religious and he did not have a bar mitzvah; Ms. Wall Spitzer was raised Southern Baptist. The couple celebrate the holidays of both religions with their three daughters but do not adhere rigorously to either. 
 On the campaign trail, Ms. Wall Spitzer, a slim, blond North Carolinian, plays the smiling political wife to perfection. But the two Harvard-trained lawyers have their policy disagreements. She opposes the death penalty; he supports it for terrorists and killers of police officers. 
 ''Eliot has a very reasoned basis for his position, but one problem with that position is it assumes that you don't make mistakes,'' she said in an e-mail message. ''I think he is deeply troubled by cases in recent years in which mistakes have been made.''
 She also seconds her husband's professed lack of presidential ambitions: ''That would not be my choice, that he run,'' she said. ''It's a real sacrifice for the family and the girls.''
 Mr. Spitzer said his legal career unfolded like ''an extraordinarily predictable resume.'' 
 ''The clerkship, the big firm'' -- it was Paul, Weiss -- ''you spend a few years as a prosecutor, then I went to Skadden, enjoyed it, thought I would become a partner, then would end up in the family business unless some governmental opportunity emerged.''
 He spent six years as a prosecutor in the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Mr. Morgenthau. His most prominent case involved breaking the mob's stranglehold on trucking in the garment district, an inquiry that took three years and involved an elaborate sting. It forced Thomas Gambino and his associates out of the business, and gave Mr. Spitzer a taste of the public limelight. 
 Mr. Spitzer called it ''a great black bag job.''
 ''We set up a trucking company, we ran the sweatshop, we had wiretaps, bugs,'' he said. ''It was a blast, and we ended up making the antitrust case against the trucking companies, each of which had organized crime tentacles or direct control, and we got amazing tapes.'' 
 He said the outcome of the case foretold the controversial strategy he would later use on Wall Street -- to forgo jail time for settlements, fines and reforms.
 ''People see this as a premonition,'' he said ''There was no jail time but they got out of the business, sold the companies, paid $12 million, which for them was big money.'' 
 In the spring of 1994, while at Skadden, Arps, Mr. Spitzer approached his supervisor, Thomas Schwarz, who ran the firm's litigation department. 
 ''He said 'I've decided to run for attorney general,' and I just about fell off my chair,'' recalled Mr. Schwarz, now president of the State University of New York in Purchase. ''I said, 'What do you mean, do you have any money?' ''
 When Mr. Spitzer told him he did, and how much, Mr. Schwarz told him to use half his money on the campaign ''and give me the other half.''
 ''The result will be just the same,'' he added. ''We both laughed about it.''

From Last to First
 If it seemed preposterous for an unknown private lawyer to run for attorney general, his family's money made it less far-fetched. To this day, Mr. Spitzer and his family live rent-free in a Madison Avenue apartment owned by his father, requiring Bernard to pay gift taxes. During his first campaign, Eliot borrowed $4.3 million from J. P. Morgan to vastly outspend his three rivals, who were suspicious about how he could finance bank loans without family help.
 ''He spent $4 million and came in fourth, but he got a lot of votes for someone who was totally unknown,'' said G. Oliver Koppell, a New York City councilman. Mr. Koppell was appointed attorney general in 1993 after his predecessor left office. Both he and Mr. Spitzer lost to Karen S. Burstein in the Democratic primary in 1994. The Republican candidate, Dennis Vacco, ultimately won. 
 Mr. Spitzer ran again in 1998 and repeatedly denied the extent to which he was using his father's money or that he was violating family contribution limits. But shortly before the election, he conceded that his father actually had lent him millions of dollars to repay the 1994 bank loan.
 The family appear to have pressed the limits of elections law. If such loans are not repaid before an election, they are considered contributions, but Bernard Spitzer's loan was not even made until after the election. Mr. Koppell unsuccessfully sued over the issue. The Board of Elections declined to investigate, partly because the law has a two-year statute of limitations. 
 Bernard called the whole episode ''very painful.''
 ''In my naivete, I couldn't believe that there was any objection, could be any objection, to a father lending money to a son who wants to enter the political world,'' he added. ''It was just unheard of, to me anyway. I was completely taken aback by that. I couldn't understand it.''
 When Mr. Spitzer ran again in 1998, he prevailed in another four-way Democratic primary. He continued to overwhelm his rivals with his spending, but Mr. Koppell said Mr. Spitzer had also learned some lessons. 
 ''He knew that he couldn't just do it with TV, like he tried to do in '94,'' he said. ''He went around the state and did more than just TV, mailings, a lot more personal campaigning.''
 In the general election, Mr. Spitzer faced a far more difficult fight against Mr. Vacco. In that race, Mr. Vacco portrayed Mr. Spitzer as a product of his father's fortune and criticized him for a lack of candor, while Mr. Spitzer accused Mr. Vacco of incompetence. 
 On election night, Mr. Spitzer led by 18,000 votes out of more than 4 million cast. Mr. Vacco did not concede until Dec. 15.
 At age 39, Mr. Spitzer was New York's new attorney general. And there was no hint of the national agenda to come. In an interview last month, he tried to explain what compelled him to run again after finishing last in 1994. 
 ''I watched as the office moved in directions that could rightfully be improved upon and said maybe this is worth a second shot,'' he said. ''And there was also the stomach, pit in the stomach sort of response. The only way to overcome a loss is to win. You don't quit.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 21, 2006

 CORRECTION:
A front-page profile yesterday of Eliot Spitzer, the Democratic candidate for governor of New York, misidentified the location of his New York apartment. It is on Fifth Avenue, not Madison.
A front-page profile on Thursday of Eliot Spitzer, the Democratic candidate for governor of New York, referred incorrectly to the credit he received from Alan Dershowitz, one of his professors at Harvard Law School, for his work on the von Bulow case. In ''Reversal of Fortune,'' Mr. Dershowitz's book about the case, he does indeed credit Mr. Spitzer by name, in the acknowledgments.
Because of an editing error, a front-page profile on Oct. 12 of Eliot Spitzer, then the Democratic candidate for governor of New York, referred incorrectly to President William McKinley, whose vice presidential running mate, Theodore Roosevelt, is one of Mr. Spitzer's political role models. McKinley was not William C.; he had no middle initial. A reader called and pointed out the error shortly after the article ran, but the message did not reach the appropriate editors. The reader sent a follow-up e-mail message on Sunday.

HEADLINE: Kim Jong-il's Suicide Watch

BYLINE: By B. R. Myers. 
B. R. Myers, an associate professor of North Korean studies at Korea University, is the author of ''Han Sorya and North Korean Literature.''

DATELINE: Seoul, South Korea 

 BODY:
HOURS after Monday's nuclear test, President Bush issued a stern warning to North Korea -- but only against the passing of nuclear technology to other states or non-state entities. The president's declaration thus reflected a confident consensus in Washington that while Kim Jong-il may try selling his nukes, he would never dream of using them himself. Why not? The explanation was given by a former national security adviser, Donald Gregg, on Monday: ''Don't panic. Kim Jong-il's objective is survival not suicide.''
 The same soothing logic could be applied to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, but of course it won't be. These long-term diagnoses of Mr. Kim's psyche are a roundabout way of saying that because he is not a fundamentalist Muslim, he is unlikely to do anything really crazy. 
 This sort of cultural profiling, however, can get us into real danger. Japan's emperor during World War II, Hirohito, was neither religious nor suicidal, and he led his nation into a war that no rational leader could have hoped to win. The point is relevant, because although journalists persist in calling North Korea a Stalinist state, its worldview is far closer to that of fascist Japan. 
 Like the Japanese in the 1930's, the North Koreans trace the origins of their race back thousands of years to a single progenitor, and claim that this pure bloodline makes them uniquely virtuous. The country's mass games -- government-choreographed spectacles with a cast of more than 100,000 -- are often mistaken by foreign journalists as exercises in Stalinism. They are in fact celebrations of ethnic homogeneity. ''No masses in the world,'' the state-run Cheollima magazine reminded readers in 2005, ''are purer and more upright than our masses.'' 
 In state propaganda, Kim Jong-il is often linked, as Hirohito once was, to images of white horses, snow-capped mountain peaks and other symbols of racial purity. South Korea, on the other hand, is regarded as contaminated by too close contact with other races. At a recent meeting between generals from both Koreas, the North delegation's leader condemned the South for allowing racial intermarriage. ''Not a single drop of ink,'' he intoned, ''must be allowed to fall into the Han River.''
 Naturally enough, the North Koreans' race theory, like that of the Japanese fascists, actuates a blithe indifference to international law. A uniquely virtuous people has no reason to obey its moral inferiors, be they allies or enemies. China has now learned that despite decades of military and economic assistance it can draw on no residue of good will in dealing with Pyongyang. 
 Neither can the South Koreans, whom the North Koreans will revile for their ethnic treason no matter how much cash they pump northward. This utter imperviousness to gestures of friendship and conciliation bears obvious implications for the prospect of normal relations between North Korea and America. 
 The northern regime has so far restricted its racial propaganda to the home audience, because it wants the world to go on misperceiving it as a Stalinist state. This way we continue to pin our hopes on the kind of trust-building dialogue that worked so well with Communists in the 1980's -- and failed so disastrously with the pure-race crowd a half-century earlier.
 While the North Koreans could kill a lot of people, they do not pose as great a threat to world security as imperial Japan did. Never have they shown any interest in forging an empire. All the same, the irrationality of their worldview is such that we should, at the very least, stop assuming that they would never use their own weaponry. 
 While Kim may not be suicidal himself, he shares Hirohito's penchant for encouraging this quality in his people: ''Defense until Death'' is an increasingly popular slogan. In 2003 a colorful poster was disseminated to the foreign press showing a fat missile in flight with a suicide-readiness slogan on it: ''Yankee, take a good hard look.'' That isn't bad advice.

HEADLINE: Council Tries to Buy Time for Stuyvesant Town Tenants

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The City Council jumped yesterday into the middle of a raging debate over the loss of middle-class housing in Manhattan, with a bill aimed at stalling the multibillion-dollar sale of two vast complexes on the East River. 
 Proponents acknowledge that the legislation, which was sponsored by 32 council members, cannot derail what promises to be the biggest real estate auction of a single property -- the Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village complexes -- in recent American history. The complexes have been an affordable redoubt for firefighters, teachers and utility workers over six decades. 
But the sponsors hope it will highlight the issue and increase political pressure on Metropolitan Life, which hopes to reap $5 billion from the sale, and on Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an advocate of affordable housing who critics say has failed to intervene on behalf of the tenants.
 Residents and tenant advocates fear that a new owner will move aggressively to transform the two complexes, where nearly three-quarters of the 11,232 apartments along First Avenue, between 14th and 23rd Streets, have regulated rents at roughly half the market rate.
 ''What's at stake here is a lot of people's lives,'' said Judy Greene, 64, who has lived in Stuyvesant Town for 43 years and visited City Hall yesterday to support the bill. ''You'll lose a lot of people who are the backbone of the city. New York is pricing out middle-class, and even upper-middle-class, families.''
 The complexes' fate is a family issue for Mrs. Greene, whose daughter and son-in-law also live in Stuyvesant Town. Her parents live in Peter Cooper Village. But the sale of the complexes has also become a cause celebre at a time when the average apartment in Manhattan sells for more than $1 million and even a studio apartment rents for more than $2,000 a month.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer has urged MetLife's chief executive, C. Robert Henrikson, to take a bid by tenants seriously. ''I made the argument that the highest offer is not necessarily the best bid,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''He agreed with the concept.''
 A group aligned with the tenants has submitted a $4.5 billion offer intended to preserve at least 40 percent of the complexes as middle-class housing, for buyers or renters. But it falls about half a billion dollars short of higher bids from some of the biggest names in real estate, including Apollo Real Estate Advisors and the Dermot Company, Tishman Speyer, the Related Companies, the Kushner Companies and Vornado Realty.
 The legislation, introduced by Councilwoman Rosie Mendez, would require the owners of large-scale apartment complexes where more than half the units are rent-regulated to provide 120 days' notice of a sale. The city's housing department, in turn, would asses the impact of losing large numbers of apartments for low-, moderate- and middle-income tenants.
 It is doubtful that the bill would be approved before MetLife completes the sale. The company, which built Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village in 1947 for returning veterans with the help of city subsidies and the use of eminent domain, wants to close the deal in November. It has asked the final bidders, including the tenants, to submit their noncontingent offers by Monday.
 Councilman Daniel R. Garodnick, who lives in a market-rate apartment in Peter Cooper and is a leader of the tenant bid, and others hope to create a climate in which MetLife would take a lower offer from the tenants, or that other bidders would preserve at least some of the apartments for middle-income families.
 Some bidders have opened discussions with the tenants through the Council's speaker, Christine C. Quinn. Given the political uncertainties, one real estate executive involved in the bidding said a buyer would be foolish not to have a strategy for dealing with the issue of affordable housing. 
 Mayor Bloomberg has so far rejected pleas to assist the tenant bid with property tax breaks or bonds. Bloomberg administration officials have told reporters on background that it would be cheaper to build housing in Queens, the Bronx or Brooklyn than to preserve the units at Stuyvesant Town. 
 ''MetLife owns it, and they have a right to sell it,'' Mr. Bloomberg said during his radio program on Friday.
 Yesterday, State Senator Liz Krueger disputed the notion that it would cost more to preserve the apartments than to build new ones. ''Somebody needs to go back to math and economics class,'' she said. ''Losing 11,000 units all at once destroys the math of the mayor's plan.''
 Now, the Republican mayor must decide whether to veto the bill, although the Council may have enough votes to override him. He also has to consider a pledge by City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., a Democrat, to invest city pension funds in the tenant bid. Both men, as well as union leaders, have seats on the city's five pension boards. The Central Labor Council has said it will provide mortgages for tenants who want to buy their apartments.
 A spokesman for the mayor said the city is reviewing the legislation.
 The Bloomberg administration has intervened in ''private'' deals in the past, including one for the West Village Houses. In return for the owner's agreement to sell apartments to the tenants at a discount to fair market value, the city forgave $19 million on a city loan and provided a tax exemption. The agreement, the mayor said in 2004, would preserve affordable housing ''in a neighborhood where tenants might otherwise have been priced out.''
 Tenant advocates say the city's housing programs create apartments for low-, moderate- and middle-income tenants by the dozens, while the sale of Stuyvesant Town raises the possibility of losing thousands of affordable apartments over time. An apartment can be decontrolled after it becomes vacant, or if the rent reaches $2,000 a month and the existing tenants' household income rises above $175,000 for two consecutive years. The Tenants Political Action Committee estimates that as many as 300,000 affordable units in the city have been lost to decontrol in the last decade. 
 ''We have a huge issue here: the continuation of middle-income housing in New York City,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''Giving credit to the mayor, the city has done more to focus on low-, moderate- and middle-income housing than anyone in years. But we're eroding units at almost the same rate as we create them.''

HEADLINE: Investor Pushes DreamWorks To Sell Shares in Offering 

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
The investment firm owned by Paul G. Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, said Wednesday that it had exercised an option to force DreamWorks Animation to sell shares in the company to the public in a secondary offering. 
 Some analysts estimate the offering will be valued around $300 million. That is $200 million -- or 40 percent -- less than the $500 million secondary offering DreamWorks canceled last year after the company missed its projections on DVD sales. Then the stock price tumbled, and Mr. Allen told DreamWorks executives that he planned to revisit the idea of an offering.
The investment firm owned by Mr. Allen, DW Investment II Inc., requested on Wednesday that the offering occur after the Nov. 3 release of ''Flushed Away,'' DreamWorks' next animated release with Aardman Animations. 
 Some animation executives in Hollywood are already predicting that the movie will have a tougher time at the box office than earlier DreamWorks films. For one, there is a glut of animated films in the market right now. DreamWorks' last film in partnership with Aardman, ''Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,'' was a critical success but a commercial flop.
 ''We believe initiating a secondary was the correct economic decision for Mr. Allen,'' said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at Pali Research.
 In August, DreamWorks executives were asked during an investor conference call if Mr. Allen had activated his option to sell but declined to say, noting the company had 90 days to respond. Some analysts suggested then that DreamWorks was trying to buy Mr. Allen's stake privately since the option would send a flood of stock into the marketplace. Other analysts suggested, though, that it would be more advantageous for Mr. Allen to sell shares to the public.
 The chief executive of DreamWorks Animation, Jeffrey Katzenberg, declined to comment about the potential offering. But the president of the company, Lewis Coleman, said in a statement, ''The company and the board have received Paul's request and will determine the appropriate timing for the offering.''
 If successful, a sale would end the complicated relationship between the founders of DreamWorks and Mr. Allen, although he will remain a significant shareholder. 
 Shares of Dreamworks dropped 45 cents yesterday, to $23.73.

HEADLINE: Fed Reports Resilience In Economy

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Maybe the sputtering housing market will not be that big of a drag on the economy after all.
 Falling gas prices are leaving Americans with more money to spend, and inflation has become less of a threat in recent weeks, according to a report released yesterday by the Federal Reserve.
Wall Street reveled at the news. Stock prices -- already buoyed by a series of strong corporate earnings announcements from companies like McDonald's and Costco -- surged even higher after the Fed's report, the beige book, came out yesterday afternoon. 
 The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped to its highest close in more than five and a half years. The Dow Jones industrial average, which last week broke a record high that had stood since 2000, climbed past 11,900 to close fewer than 53 points short of 12,000. The Nasdaq composite gained more than a point and a half. 
 A separate report showing that the nation's trade deficit reached a record high in August was apparently an afterthought for investors. The Commerce Department said that on a seasonally adjusted basis, Americans imported $69.9 billion more than they exported, up 2.7 percent from a $68 billion deficit in July. That increase was in large part a result of near record petroleum prices. 
 While the beige book was hardly a glowing picture of the nation's economy, it did strike a generally optimistic tone. It described a ''widespread cooling'' in residential housing but noted that growth in commercial real estate activity was picking up some of the slack. 
 And there were a handful of areas where residential home sales ''showed signs of resilience,'' the report said. Manhattan, Houston and Sioux Falls, S.D., were among these pockets of strength.
 ''It seems like things are still stable,'' said Marisa DiNatale of Moody's Economy.com. ''There may be moderating growth, but it's certainly not a drastic slowdown.''
 Other potential problem spots in the economy -- rising prices and slower consumer spending -- do not appear to be much of a problem at all in many areas of the country, the report said. Consumers spent freely, taking vacations and shopping for back-to-school items. Wage growth was described as generally ''modest.'' And there were few signs of pressure from higher prices as the cost of gasoline dropped.
 Economists said falling fuel prices should be reflected in the next trade deficit report. Energy costs were the major reason for the widening trade gap in August, with the deficit in petroleum-related products accounting for nearly all of the $1.9 billion increase. The amount Americans spent on foreign-made household appliances and electronics also rose.
 ''The trade balance should improve significantly soon,'' Dimitry Fleming, an economist with ING, said in a research note. ''August, however, was never going to be the starting point, with the lagged effects of higher oil prices.''
 The growing trade imbalance with China was another major factor in the ballooning trade deficit. The unadjusted trade deficit for August was $79 billion. Nearly a third of that, $22 billion, represented the gap in trade between the United States and China.
 The numbers defied expectations. Economists who were surveyed before the numbers came out predicted that the overall deficit would fall in August, but it rose, seasonally adjusted, by $1.9 billion from July. 
 When the gap hit a record in July, economists said they believed that the numbers were nearing a peak. But as energy prices remained high this summer, the deficit continued to swell. Still, many economists said yesterday that they now believed that the turning point was near.
 ''This is probably as bad as it gets,'' wrote Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist with the economics research firm Capital Economics.
 Yesterday, the Chinese reported their own trade numbers, which showed a surplus of $15.3 billion for September. China's trade surplus hit a record $18.8 billion in August. 
 While American reliance on foreign goods is showing no signs of weakening, exports also remained strong. After declining in July, exports grew in August by 2.3 percent, to $122.4 billion. But that rate of growth was not strong enough to offset the rise in imports, which reached $192.3 billion in August. That was an increase of 2.4 percent. 
 Peter Kretzmer, senior economist with Bank of America, said such strong import growth was a sign the economy would expand at a faster rate in the final months of the year. ''We've been surprised by how strong import growth is,'' he said. ''This strong domestic demand may be a bit of a harbinger of a strong domestic economy going into the fourth quarter.''

HEADLINE: Healthy Earnings Push Dow Past 11,900

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average broke through 11,900 to close at another record high yesterday, aided by optimism over the health of corporate earnings.
 The index's gain was its fifth record close in two weeks; the Dow also set a record intraday high.
The markets were upbeat yesterday, with investors focusing on positive news from well-known consumer brands like McDonald's and on the latest economic data. Oil prices, which remain near lows for the year, also helped the mood on Wall Street. 
 ''In general we're getting friendly reports, between oil inventories being up higher than expected and then some bellwether companies that are exceeding estimates,'' said John C. Forelli, portfolio manager for Independence Investment in Boston. ''It's kind of a return to the Goldilocks economy.''
 The Dow rose 95.57 points, or 0.81 percent, to 11,947.70. The advance put the 12,000 threshold within investors' sights. The previous record close, from Tuesday, was 11,867.17. The intraday high set yesterday was 11,959.63, eclipsing an earlier record of 11,872.94 reached Monday.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 12.88 points, or 0.95 percent, at 1,362.83, and the Nasdaq composite index showed the day's biggest gain, advancing 37.91 points, or 1.64 percent, to 2,346.18.
 Bonds rose, with the price of the benchmark 10-year note rising 2/32, to 100 26/32. The yield fell to 4.77 percent, from 4.78 percent on Wednesday.
 Oil prices hovered near lows for the year after an Energy Department report that inventories were higher last week and amid doubts about whether OPEC's members will be able to agree on an immediate production cut. The price of a barrel of light, sweet crude, which settled at a low for the year on Wednesday, rose 27 cents, to $57.86, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Investors got a look at the state of the economy with the release of the Federal Reserve's beige book, which summarizes regional economic activity. It reported that economic growth appeared to be moderate or mixed -- findings that seemed to reassure investors looking for the economy to slow at a reasonable pace.
 Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at Dresdner Kleinwort, said the beige book was more optimistic in tone than the one issued in August. ''They didn't say there was much of an inflation problem. Investors saw this as confirmation that the Fed is on hold,'' he said.
 Positive corporate news proved reassuring for some investors.
 McDonald's rose 98 cents, or 2.38 percent, to $42.23 after saying systemwide same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, rose 9.8 percent in September. McDonald's, the world's largest fast-food chain and one of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow, said its third-quarter profit would top Wall Street's expectation.
 Costco Wholesale, the warehouse chain, advanced $3.83, or 7.65 percent, to $53.90 after reporting profit in its fiscal fourth quarter rose 1 percent while revenue rose 19 percent.
 Yum Brands, parent of the Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC fast-food chains, rose $4.51, or 8.26 percent, to $59.08 after reporting that its third-quarter profit increased 12 percent, aided by growth in China. The company raised its full-year profit forecast above Wall Street's expectation.
 PepsiCo fell $1.01, to $62.85, despite posting a 71 percent increase in its third-quarter profit. The snack food and soft drink maker said sales rose 9 percent from the year-ago period, which was hurt by a tax charge. The company's forecast, however, was short of Wall Street's expectation.
 The Deluxe Corporation, whose products include checks and business cards, jumped $3.08, or 16.9 percent, to $21.29, after raising its third-quarter and full-year profit forecasts.
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners roughly four to one on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 2.53 billion shares, compared with 2.60 billion shares Wednesday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 10-year inflation-protected notes: 



 (000 omitted in dollar figures)	 	High Price	101.503	High Yield	2.426	Low Yield	2.300	Median Yield	2.390	Accepted at low price	41%	Total applied for	$18,122,236	Accepted	$9,411,776	Noncompetitive	$29,871	Interest set at	2 1/2%	

The 10-year inflation notes mature July 15, 2016.

Broadway

'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial 90-minute entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime star of the television comedy ''Soap,'' gives a pocket history of the profession, in addition to an ample demonstration, with partners that include a vulture who sings ''My Way,'' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke, a talking tennis ball and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood)

'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped biomusical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Neil Genzlinger)

'BIRTH AND AFTER BIRTH' Baby is a bruiser in Tina Howe's self-conscious foray into the jungles of absurdism. Written in 1972, this explosion of the nuclear family appears to be stepping, with cautious exactitude, in the footprints of early Edward Albee. Christian Parker directed the rather stilted cast (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BLUE DOOR' An African-American math professor struggles to reconnect to his cultural past in this small but densely packed new play by Tanya Barfield. Reg E. Cathey is the math prof, abandoned by his wife and visited by the ghosts of his ancestors, all played by the vibrant young actor Andre Holland (1:35). Playwrights Horizons, Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

'BUSH IS BAD: IMPEACHMENT EDITION' A musical revue of silly, heavy-handed sketches aimed at Bush-haters (1:30). Triad Theater, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)

'DRUG BUDDY' The aimless Texas drug dealers of David Folwell's slight slacker dramedy are one losers' club we wouldn't mind spending more time with, particularly the engaging lead, Matthew Stadelmann. But ''Drug Buddy'' leaves barely a bruise, let alone a buzz (51 minutes). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 868-4444. (Rob Kendt)

'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)

'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue biomusical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Zinoman)

'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'JOHN FERGUSON' This 1919 tragedy about a poor Irish family and how far its members will go not to lose their farm is a compelling, fully realized drama with a cast that doesn't miss a beat (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Gates)

'KING LEAR' The ''promised end'' comes with disarming swiftness in this Classical Theater of Harlem production, starring Andre De Shields, which clocks in at just over two hours, not including an intermission. There's nothing distilled about Mr. De Shields's vigorous performance in the title role, but his impressive energy is not always productively channeled, and the supporting cast is uneven (2:10). The Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)

* 'NIXON'S NIXON' Russell Lees's savory political satire takes place on the night before the president announced his resignation. Gerry Bamman and Steve Mellor created the roles of Nixon and Kissinger, respectively, in the original production from 1995, also directed by Jim Simpson, and they return to them with the ease of veteran vaudevillians slipping back into a comfortable partnership (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE' A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)

'RICHARD II' Michael Cumpsty plays the ineffectual king who loses a crown and gains a soul in Brian Kulick's middling production for the Classic Stage Company. Mr. Cumpsty traces Richard's worldly downfall and spiritual ascent with affecting clarity, but the production is a little glib and a little bland (2:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood)

'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'SONGS OF THE DRAGONS FLYING TO HEAVEN' Young Jean Lee has fashioned a hysterically funny piece of theater with twisted socio-political power and giggly Korean dancers who would fit right into a Quentin Tarantino movie (1:30). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)

'SUBURBIA' This black-hole revival of Eric Bogosian's 1994 group portrait of losers in Angstville, U.S.A., directed by Jo Bonney, features lively performances from Gaby Hoffman, Kieran Culkin and Jessica Capshaw. But even if you're as success-addicted as Donald Trump, you're likely to find yourself identifying with these characters in the wrong way: They're beyond caring what happens to them, and so are you (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)

'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

* 'THE TOOTH OF CRIME' This highly entertaining revival of Sam Shepard's musical comic-book melodrama about celebrity, mortality and rock 'n' roll may not be the slickest show around. But as directed by George Ferencz, it brings a demystifying clarity to a work often dismissed as a smoky head trip and makes a strong case for ''Tooth'' as one of Mr. Shepard's best plays (2:15). La MaMa Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Brantley)

'THE TREATMENT' A new play by Eve Ensler (''The Vagina Monologues'') depicting fraught encounters between a traumatized war veteran and a military psychologist. Fervently acted by Dylan McDermott and Portia, it is an overwrought amalgam of psychodrama and political sermonizing (1:05). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983, impactfestival.org. (Isherwood)

'WRECKS' The tail wags the scorpion in the latest play by Neil LaBute to be propelled by a poisoned lunch line. This slender, prickly tease of a monologue -- whose whole raison-d'etre is its last-minute revelation -- is given substance by an expert performance by Ed Harris as a newly bereaved widower (1:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley)

Off Off Broadway

'EL CONQUISTADOR!' Thaddeus Phillips's one-man show about a hapless Colombian doorman can be slow, but it's also ingenious and an excellent showcase for Mr. Phillips, who would have made a great silent-movie comedian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'FOOLS AND LOVERS' The idea itself is questionable: let's make a musical about a chintzy wedding based entirely on Shakespearean texts. And the realization does not improve on the inspiration. Andrew Sherman's music perfectly duplicates the aesthetic of a second-rate wedding band, and to add a layer of realism, many of the actors have trouble carrying a tune. All that the exercise ultimately proves is that you can make Shakespeare say anything (1:20). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Anne Midgette)

'IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING' Bill Bowers's zestful, endearing one-man show is about his life as a mime, an actor and a gay boy growing up in Montana (1:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, off Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Gates)

'THE PAIN AND THE ITCH' A sharp-elbowed new comedy by Bruce Norris about the indiscreet hypocrisies of the urban liberal bourgeoisie. Some familiar dysfunctions and some more exotic ones disrupt Thanksgiving dinner. Funny but tough to stomach (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'SISTERS' Declan Hassett's dark tale of sibling rivalry set in rural Ireland occasions the welcome return to the New York stage of Anna Manahan, the Irish actress who won a Tony in 1998 playing the ferociously needy mother in Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane.'' A bit less welcome is Mr. Hassett's relentlessly downbeat play itself (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'THEOPHILUS NORTH' Matthew Burnett's adaptation of the Thornton Wilder novel about a young man's not quite interpersonal relationships in 1926 Newport is affable if sometimes oversentimental (2:00). Harold Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Gates)

'WASPS IN BED' This Berkshires-to-bedroom farce would make a clever sitcom, if only the authors would face the fact that it isn't really about sex (1:45). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Gates)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'ALL THE KING'S MEN' (PG-13, 120 minutes) This second adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's big novel of political and spiritual corruption in Depression-era Louisiana is full of grand themes, good actors (Jude Law, Sean Penn, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo) and lovingly-photographed southern scenery. And yet nothing seems to work. It's a chaotic stew of ambitions and ideas, but in the end neither convincing nor coherent. (A. O. Scott)

'THE BLACK DAHLIA' (R, 119 minutes) Brian De Palma drains the life out of James Ellroy's take on the spectacularly cruel 1947 murder of a young Los Angeles woman known as the Black Dahlia. The stars Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson and Aaron Eckhart don't help matters, though Hilary Swank is dandy. (Manohla Dargis)

'BLACK GOLD' (No rating, 78 minutes, in English, Oromifa and Amharic) This documentary tells an unresolved modern version of the age-old David and Goliath story. The giants in this case are multinational corporations that control the worldwide coffee market. The heroic little guy, Tadesse Meskela, who represents the Oromo Coffee Farmers Co-op Union, devotes himself tirelessly to traveling the world looking for buyers who will pay a fair price for the beans harvested by the country's 70,000 coffee farmers. (Stephen Holden)

'BROKEN SKY' (No rating, 140 minutes, in Spanish) Boy meets boy, as you've never seen, in Julian Hernandez's sex-drenched, extravagantly minimalist epic. (Nathan Lee)

* 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)

'EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH' (PG, 103 minutes) A minimum-wage comedy chronicling the romance between a slacker box boy (Dane Cook) and a bodacious cashier (Jessica Simpson) working at a Costco-like megastore. Directed by Greg Coolidge with the creative flair of an entry-level training video, the movie is tireder than a Wal-Mart greeter at the end of a Saturday shift. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

* '49 UP' (No rating, 134 minutes) In the latest installment of documentary cinema's longest-running, most fascinating experiment, the British schoolchildren first interviewed in ''7 Up'' (1964) have settled into middle age. As always, there are quiet revelations and surprises, and ordinary human experience somehow becomes more fascinating and mysterious than any other subject. (Scott)

'FLYBOYS' (PG-13, 129 minutes) Empty-headed and egregiously polite, this nostalgia trip to World War I is what you'd get if Norman Rockwell directed ''Top Gun.'' (Lee)

'GRIDIRON GANG' (PG-13, 120 minutes) Set in a California juvenile detention center, ''Gridiron Gang'' stars Dwayne Johnson, best known as the Rock, as Sean Porter, the real-life probation officer who fights recidivism with football. Jumping from heartwarming to murderous, this is a sports-as-rehab movie that wants to have its gangbanging and cure it, too. (Catsoulis)

* 'A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS' (R, 98 minutes) Rough, ragged and full of life, this autobiographical movie, written and directed by Dito Montiel, about his youth on the streets of Astoria, Queens, is a remarkable debut, stuffed almost to bursting with bold performances and operatic emotions. (Scott)

'THE GUARDIAN' (PG-13, 139 minutes) A veteran Coast Guard rescue swimmer (Kevin Costner) mentors a young hotshot swimming champion (Ashton Kutcher) in this predictable, overly long but nonetheless serviceable tribute to a branch of the United States military that has been somewhat neglected in the movies. (Scott)

* 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Holden)

* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott)

'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. The director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis)

* 'JACKASS: NUMBER TWO' (R, 92 minutes) Debased, infantile and reckless in the extreme, this compendium of body bravado and malfunction makes for some of the most fearless, liberated and cathartic comedy in modern movies. (Lee)

'JET LI'S FEARLESS' (PG-13, 105 minutes, in Mandarin) Jet Li says goodbye (supposedly) to the martial arts genre with this decent blend of old-school chopsocky and new-school superproduction. (Lee)

'KETTLE OF FISH' (R, 93 minutes) Casting Gina Gershon as a mousy scientist (yeah, right) is the first mistake, though by no means the last, in this deeply misguided romantic comedy. (Lee)

'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)

'THE LAST KISS' (R, 104 minutes) Tony Goldwyn's remake of a popular Italian film is thin and clumsy, but nonetheless unusually candid in its treatment of human sexual misbehavior. Zach Braff plays a young man who, on the brink of turning 30 and about to become a father, panics and cheats on his girlfriend (Jacinda Barrett). (Scott)

* 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)

'OPEN SEASON' (PG, 100 minutes) In this grand-scale animated comedy-adventure about a grizzly bear and a mule deer who assemble an oddball army of animals to fight the hunters, periodic bursts of cleverness and eye-popping imagery, further enhanced in the 3-D IMAX version, can't disguise that it's just another movie full of jive-talking computer-generated animals with little new to say. (Laura Kern)

* 'OUT OF PLACE: MEMORIES OF EDWARD SAID' and 'EDWARD SAID: THE LAST INTERVIEW' (No rating, 138 minutes and 114 minutes, in English, Arabic and Hebrew) Two documentaries about the Palestinian writer and thinker Edward Said explore his life, his chronic alienation and his sympathy for the Palestinian cause. Loosely framed by readings from Mr. Said's 1999 memoir of the same title, ''Out of Place: Memories of Edward Said'' is less a biography than a rambling meditation on exile, identity and the psychological scars of dispossession. More satisfying is the complex portrait provided by ''Edward Said: The Last Interview,'' a riveting record of Mr. Said's 2002 conversation with the journalist Charles Glass. Engrossing and wide-ranging, the film proves that a couch, a camera and a great mind can be all the inspiration a filmmaker needs. (Catsoulis)

* 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis)

'SCHOOL FOR SCOUNDRELS' (PG-13, 101 minutes) Billy Bob Thornton stars as an alpha scoundrel who runs a self-improvement course for sad sacks of the sort persuasively played by the film's other lead actor, Jon Heder. (Dargis)

* 'THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP' (R, 106 minutes, in English, French and Spanish) A bittersweet dream of romance from Michel Gondry. Inventive and enchanting. (Scott)

* 'SHORTBUS' (No rating, 102 minutes) John Cameron Mitchell's ode to the joy and sweet release of sex also manages to be a sincere, modest political venture that finds humor where you might least expect it. (Dargis)

'THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING' (R, 84 minutes) A prequel to a remake of a 1974 movie that spawned several sequels and numberless copycats, this hateful trash begs the question: how many chainsaw massacres can one state possibly contain? (Lee)

'WRESTLING WITH ANGELS: PLAYWRIGHT TONY KUSHNER' (No rating, 98 minutes) In this entertaining but shallow documentary portrait of the playwright Tony Kushner, its likable subject contradicts the cliche image of the left-wing intellectual as a grim, preachy commissar of political correctness. He comes across as a welcoming public figure who has a gift for being very funny and serious at the same time. (Holden)

Film Series

'ECLATS DE RIRE' (Through Oct. 31) The French Institute Alliance Francaise is screening French comedies every Tuesday.

The film, about Washingtonians who maneuver, stars Henry Fonda and a scene-stealing Charles Laughton. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

ART BRUT (Wednesday and Thursday) Rock 'n' roll needs to celebrate as well as ridicule its own mythology, and Art Brut, sarcastically but exuberantly singing about the thrill of plugging in and making a ruckus -- ''Formed a band, we formed a band/Look at us, we formed a band!'' -- is one of the rare groups that can do both. With Spinto Band. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $17.50 in advance, $19 at the door.

BECK (Wednesday) Since he broke through with the slacker anthem ''Loser'' in 1994, Beck has waffled between snidely ironic hip-hop pastiche and glum acoustic balladry. His latest, ''The Information'' (Interscope), is in the hip-hop category, with the kind of pop-culture crazy-quilt lyrics that only Beck could come up with: ''I got a silicon Bible song/Paranoid Jumbotron.'' With Spank Rock. At 8 p.m., the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $54.50. (Sisario)

* CBGB (Tonight through Sunday) The clock is ticking for CBGB, the storied Bowery dive that in the 1970's incubated New York's greatest generation of punk rock. The club must close by the end of the month, and the shows this weekend have been billed as its last. The Dictators, whose muscular three-chord chants are paragons of tidy melody and obnoxious humor, play tonight and tomorrow night. Also tomorrow, Debbie Harry and Chris Stein of Blondie offer an acoustic set. Sunday night is the big blowout with Patti Smith and her band. At 8 p.m., 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com; sold out. (Sisario)

C. J. CHENIER (Sunday) The son of Clifton Chenier, who was the undisputed king of zydeco, C. J. Chenier picked up his father's accordion and his Red Hot Louisiana Band in the 1980's, carrying on the family tradition of bayou dance music laced with blues. At 7:30 p.m., with a free dance lesson at 6:30, Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597, letszydeco.com; $22. (Jon Pareles)

DIRTY DOZEN BRASS BAND (Tonight) The magnificent ensemble that revitalized New Orleans brass-band music. It swaggers through the city's whole musical heritage: parades, rumba, swing, bebop and modern jazz, for starters. Solos can head for the far side of tonality, but the band never loses touch with gutbucket, danceable funk. At 11, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $19. (Pareles)

DUB TRIO (Thursday) Made up of well-traveled session players for the likes of the Fugees and Mos Def, Dub Trio plays spacious reggae grooves spiked with high-adrenaline punk, affectionately recalling Bad Brains. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; $10 a set. (Sisario)

VINCE GILL (Monday) This sweet-voiced country classicist is touring with a 17-piece band and an especially big addition to his repertory: on Tuesday he will release ''These Days'' (MCA Nashville), a four-CD set of all new material, featuring Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt, Michael McDonald, Gretchen Wilson, LeAnn Rimes and enough other stars to fill a downtown Nashville honky-tonk. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $35 to $50. (Sisario)

GOLDFRAPP (Wednesday) Led by Allison Goldfrapp, a techno glamourpuss part Marlene Dietrich and part Debbie Harry, this British duo plays cool, vaguely futuristic electronica. At 7:30 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $30 in advance, $34 at the door. (Sisario)

JOLIE HOLLAND (Wednesday) With a playful quiver of a voice that can make her resemble a countryfied Billie Holliday, and a junk-shop aesthetic that mingles brassy swing with Appalachian folk, Ms. Holland sings charming, deceptively childlike songs: ''Crush in the Ghetto,'' on her new album, ''Springtime Can Kill You'' (Anti-), finds her overdressed on a bus ride home from a one-night stand. With David Dondero. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario)

INDIGO GIRLS (Tonight) Guitar strumming, close harmonies, coffeehouse earnestness and songs about the perpetual struggle for love, self-affirmation and a clear conscience have made the duo of Emily Saliers and Amy Ray perennials for the collegiate at heart. With Roman Candle. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $30 and $40. (Pareles)

* LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO (Tuesday) This great South African vocal group, which introduced so much of the world to close, bass-heavy Zulu harmony on Paul Simon's ''Graceland,'' is at Carnegie Hall for the first time since appearing with Mr. Simon there 19 years ago. Guests include Sarah McLachlan, Natalie Merchant, the Mahotella Queens, Vusi Mahlasela and Pete Seeger. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $21 to $72. (Sisario)

JENNY LEWIS (Tonight) Already the sad-eyed, short-skirted princess of indie rock as the lead singer of Rilo Kiley, Jenny Lewis made an inspired step with her first solo album, whose luscious country-gospel ruminations of romantic and spiritual doubt (''It's not that I believe in your almighty/But I might as well as insurance or bail'') made her its Dusty Springfield as well. At 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; $25. (Sisario)

PET SHOP BOYS (Tomorrow) The British duo that perfected the pouty and aloof techno-pop of Human League returned this year with ''Fundamental'' (Capitol), a reunion with Trevor Horn, one of its 1980's producers. Only the Pet Shop Boys can sing jabberwocky lines like ''I thought I heard a train/Down in the cemetery/Cellophane'' and make them sound sexy and evil. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $29.50 to $99.50. (Sisario)

RASCAL FLATTS (Tomorrow) The sweetest, most tooth-rotting bubblegum is always the best. This pop-country trio -- big emphasis on pop -- specializes in a kind of mawkish sentimentality that has to be admired for sheer shamelessness, as in ''Skin (Sarabeth),'' an after-school special with a waltz beat about a girl with leukemia: ''It would be a mistake/For someone to take/A girl with no hair to the prom.'' (Her date shaves his head in sympathy.) At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $44.50 to $84.50. (Sisario)

RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, MARS VOLTA (Tuesday and Wednesday) Though their transformation from sex-mad punk-funk pranksters to crooning penitents is pretty much complete, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are not above the occasional appearance dressed only in tube socks (not on their feet). With the Mars Volta, leaders of the unlikely renaissance of byzantine prog-metal. At 8 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $63. (Sisario)

ROYAL DRUMMERS OF BURUNDI (Tomorrow and Monday) First heard by most Western listeners as the spooky, lusty pulse on Joni Mitchell's 1975 album ''The Hissing of Summer Lawns,'' these musicians and dancers -- who sometimes call themselves the Master Drummers of Burundi, or simply the Drummers of Burundi -- conjure an elemental musical force through ritualized unison percussion. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rodgers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $50. Sunday at 3 p.m., Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833, lehmancenter.org; $20 to $35. (Sisario)

EARL SCRUGGS (Tonight) Bluegrass banjo as we know it simply would not exist without Earl Scruggs, who joined Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys in 1945 and proceeded to revolutionize banjo playing with a three-finger picking style that accelerates to ballistic speeds. At 7:45 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $40. (Pareles)

ANOUSHKA SHANKAR (Thursday) The sitarist Anoushka Shankar, who has up to this point been an aesthetic acolyte of her father's lithe, neo-traditional take on improvisatory raga, has recently been experimenting with a combination of acoustic and electronic backing instrumentation. At 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rodgers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $55. (Pareles)

SOCIAL DISTORTION (Tonight) Formed in 1978 by its songwriter, Mike Ness, Social Distortion plays punk-rock with a roots-rock twang. In his songs Mr. Ness is still trying to figure out the meaning of life, chronicling everything from anti-fashion stubbornness to feeling his age. At 8:30, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Pareles)

* 'THE SPIRIT OF FES' (Tomorrow) The Festival of Sacred Music in Fes, Morocco, is the inspiration for this ecumenical concert. It includes Daqqa Roudania, a group from Morocco, performing ecstatic, percussion-driven Sufi music and dance; Gerard Edery singing Sephardic songs that hark back to Renaissance music; Susan Hellauer from Anonymous 4, singing Gregorian chant; the South Indian classical singer Aruna Sairam, with Hindu devotional music; and Arabic music from Zafer Tawil, playing oud and violin, and Jamey Haddad on percussion. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 and $42. (Pareles)

ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) The third autobiographical go-round by this feisty 81-year-old legend features 10 astutely chosen new songs (including the theme from ''The Sopranos'') performed with verve and humor. But her between-song patter finds her at a loss to come up with amusing or enlightening new stories from her glittering show business life. At 8:45 p.m., Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $125; dinner required. (Stephen Holden)

TILLY AND THE WALL (Tuesday) An indie-rock band playing tuneful, yearning anthems of sexuality and confusion is nothing new, but this Omaha quintet has one truly unusual (and effective) gimmick: the percussion comes from the manic tap-dancing of one of its members, Jamie Williams. With Northern State. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario)

TV ON THE RADIO (Tuesday and Wednesday) One of Brooklyn's most consistently intriguing bands, TV on the Radio casts a dark and seductive spell with swirling electronics, washes of Pixies-esque guitar and, most alluringly, vocals that draw from both early Peter Gabriel and doo-wop. With Grizzly Bear. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario)

YOU AM I (Wednesday and Thursday) With its exhilarating rave-ups and Tim Rogers's windmill guitar slashes -- both recalling the best of the Who -- You Am I is one of the most exciting bands to come out of Australia in a decade, though it has struggled for recognition here. At 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15. (Sisario)

Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

* SATHIMA BEA BENJAMIN (Tuesday) As a singer, Ms. Benjamin shines on standards without forsaking her South African heritage, a subtle achievement represented on a career-spanning new compilation called ''Song Spirit'' (Ekapa). She performs here in celebration of her 70th birthday, with instrumental support from the pianist Onaje Allan Gumbs, the bassist Buster Williams and the drummer Victor Lewis. At 8 and 9:30 p.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626, sweetrhythmny.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Nate Chinen)

CHRIS BOTTI/JOHN PIZZARELLI (Tonight) Mr. Botti has emerged as the lite-jazz hero of our time, a trumpeter whose photogenic presence and brooding sensuality both suit the current notion of the standard songbook as a lifestyle accessory. His low-gloss polish is likable, and in concert he tends to stretch out a bit with his band, which is first-rate. For a more buoyant take on jazz-pop crossover, though, look to the other half of this bill, featuring Mr. Pizzarelli, the ever-breezy guitarist and singer. At 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, One Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, www.njpac.org; $20 to $58. (Chinen)

DON BYRON PLAYS JUNIOR WALKER (Tonight through Sunday night) The clarinetist Don Byron has lately been playing more tenor saxophone, a development that motivated his latest concept album, ''Do the Boomerang'' (Blue Note). It's a tribute to the Motown saxophonist-singer Junior Walker, by a clutch of musicians equally at home playing jazz and soul: the guitarist David Gilmore, the keyboardist George Colligan, the bassist Brad Jones and the drummer Rodney Holmes. One of the two vocalists on the album, Chris Thomas King, will also appear. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25; $30 tonight and tomorrow. (Chinen)

REGINA CARTER (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Carter is a jazz violinist of uncommon accomplishment: a few years ago she became the first African-American musician to play Paganini's cherished instrument in Genoa, Italy, and a few weeks ago she received a prestigious ''genius grant'' from the MacArthur Foundation. Her recent album ''I'll Be Seeing You: A Sentimental Journey'' (Verve) honors the memory of her mother by reinterpreting some of the prewar popular songs she loved. (Through Oct. 21.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

STEVE COLEMAN AND FIVE ELEMENTS (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Coleman's alto saxophone cuts cleanly through the angular free-funk of his signature ensemble, which includes Jonathan Finlayson on trumpet, Tim Albright on trombone, Jen Shyu on vocals, Tyshawn Sorey on drums and, on Wednesday only, Thomas Morgan on bass. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $12; members, $10. (Chinen)

COOPER-MOORE QUARTET/MATANA ROBERTS QUARTET (Tomorrow) The man known as Cooper-Moore, an extreme polyglot even by avant-garde standards, leads a band that features his own handmade instruments alongside the alto saxophone of Darius Jones and the percussion of Juma Santos and Chad Taylor. Matana Roberts, a husky-toned alto saxophonist and junior member of the A.A.C.M., is at her best when responding to ensemble actions; her group, performing in a later set, includes the tenor saxophonist Matt Bauder, the bassist Tom Abbs and the drummer Tomas Fujiwara. At 7:30 and 9 p.m., Clemente Soto Velez SEA Theater, 107 Suffolk Street, at Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681, visionfestival.org; cover, $20 a set. (Chinen)

EDDIE DANIELS's 65TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Thursday) The clarinetist Eddie Daniels will reach standard retirement age on Thursday, though he doesn't seem to have much interest in laying back. The first of his four nights at Iridium will feature numerous guests, including his fellow clarinetists Ken Peplowski, Ron Odrich and Paquito D'Rivera (who also plays alto saxophone). The house rhythm section will consist of Joe Locke on vibraphone, David Finck on bass and Joe La Barbera on drums. (Through Oct. 22.) At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $32.50, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

* FESTIVAL OF NEW TRUMPET MUSIC (Tonight through Sunday night) This stylistically expansive series concludes this weekend, after a month of horn-centric programming. Tonight the trumpeters John McNeil and Ron Horton jointly present a group that also includes a third trumpeter, the festival's founder, Dave Douglas; tomorrow there will be sets led by Butch Morris and then Ted Daniel. The series finale, a benefit for music programs in New York public schools, will feature an honor roll of guests, including the composer and alto saxophonist John Zorn, the bassist Henry Grimes and the Zlatne Uste Balkan Brass Band. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30, Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $15, with a one-drink minimum. Sunday from 2 to 5 p.m. at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-6377, fontmusic.org; $20 to $100. (Chinen)

DIZZY GILLESPIE ALL-STAR BIG BAND (Tuesday through Thursday) Bebop's goateed ambassador did some of his best work with big bands, a fact that this repertory ensemble, led by his former trombonist and arranger Slide Hampton, happily exploits. The band -- which has a strong recent album, ''Dizzy's Business'' (Telarc) -- includes other veterans of Gillespie's employ, like the saxophonists James Moody and Paquito D'Rivera. The trumpeter Roy Hargrove is a natural choice to fill Gillespie's shoes. (Through Oct. 22.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)

* JIM HALL TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) Jim Hall's economical style and deep harmonic command have made him a quiet hero of jazz guitar; he leads his regular trio with the bassist Steve LaSpina and the drummer Terry Clarke. (Through Oct. 22.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.net; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

STEFON HARRIS (Wednesday) ''African Tarantella: Dances With Duke'' (Blue Note) is the sixth album by the vibraphonist Stefon Harris, and one of his strongest; it's an interpretation of music from two Duke Ellington suites, along with several original themes. As he does on the album, Mr. Harris augments his working quartet here with the trombonist Steve Turre, the clarinetist Mark Vinci, the flutist Anne Drummond, the cellist Louise Dubin and the violist Junah Chung. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $44. (Chinen)

JIMMY HEATH'S 80TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Tonight through Sunday night) The saxophonist and composer Jimmy Heath will turn 80 this month, and the Blue Note is celebrating the occasion with an engagement replete with such special guests as the trumpeter Clark Terry (tonight and tomorrow) and the saxophonist and flutist James Moody (Sunday), who have both infused their octogenarian years with youthful brio. At 8 and 10:30, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)

RODNEY KENDRICK (Tonight) Mr. Kendrick is a commanding pianist who has gradually been returning to the spotlight after a bit of a hiatus. He appears as part of a new Fazioli Salon solo piano series at the Klavierhaus workshop. At 8, Klavierhaus, 211 West 58th Street, Manhattn, (212) 245-4535, pianoculture.com; $20. (Chinen)

* LATIN JAZZ CONCERT USA (Thursday) A rich bonanza of Afro-Caribbean and Latin American artists, including the conga legend Candido Camero, the flutist Dave Valentin, the singer Xiomara Laugart and the guitarist and singer David Oquendo, among many others. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org; $30 to $60. (Chinen)

BEN MONDER (Wednesday) ''Oceana'' (Sunnyside), the most recent album by the guitarist Ben Monder, is a small-scale but ambitious suite of original music that doesn't sound quite like anything else. He will present some of the same material here, with the bassist Ben Street and the drummer Ted Poor. At 9:30 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)

MARK MURPHY (Tomorrow and Sunday) Mr. Murphy is a singer known mainly for sly insouciance, but on his recent album ''Once to Every Heart'' (Verve), he opted for a burnished and broken romanticism. He is performing with a small group featuring the pianist Misha Piatigorsky. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., with a midnight set tomorrow, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

MICHAEL MUSILLAMI TRIO (Wednesday) Serpentine lyricism and angular forms are major attributes of ''Dachau,'' an album released last year by the guitarist Michael Mussillami on his own Playscape label. Joined by the bassist Joe Fonda and the drummer George Schuller, he'll revisit that recording, as well as a newer one, ''Fragile Forms,'' also on Playscape. At 8 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)

TED NASH QUINTET (Tuesday through Thursday) The saxophonist Ted Nash has proved to be a smart and resourceful bandleader, especially for ensembles like this one, which has Marcus Printup on trumpet, Frank Kimbrough on piano, Ben Allison on bass and Matt Wilson on drums. (Through Oct. 22.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)

ROY NATHANSON (Wednesday) ''Sotto Voce'' (AUM Fidelity), the latest recording by the saxophonist Roy Nathanson, makes full use of his unusual skills as a conceptualist and raconteur. All the members of his band double on vocals, occasionally suggesting a literate and subversive barbershop quartet; one, Napoleon Maddox, provides the beat-box percussion that hustles the music along. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $15, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)

AARON PARKS QUARTET (Tonight) Aaron Parks, a promising young pianist who has turned heads for the past few years in Terence Blanchard's working band, leads a quartet full of fine players: the guitarist Ben Monder, the bassist Matt Brewer and the drummer Rodney Green. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15; members, $10. (Chinen)

SECTION QUARTET/TRAVIS SULLIVAN'S BJORKESTRA (Thursday) Two young ensembles, each focused on repertory of a contemporary strain: the Section Quartet takes a crack at the Radiohead album ''OK Computer,'' while the Bjorkestra scores the music of Bjork for big band. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $25 ($20 in advance). (Chinen)

US FREE (Tuesday and Wednesday) The drummer Andrew Cyrille and the bassist Henry Grimes are members of an avant-garde jazz generation that came of age in the 1960's and 70's, while the tenor saxophonist Bill McHenry is a comparably newer arrival who has earned respect in his peer group and beyond. The trio has a goofy name that will probably ring true, with collectivity and freedom high on the agenda. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20. (Chinen)

* BEBO VALDES (Tonight and tomorrow) Mr. Valdes, a pianist, composer and august figure in the history of Cuban music, won a Grammy and a Latin Grammy last year for his superlative album ''Bebo de Cuba'' (Calle 54). The centerpiece of that album is ''Suite Cubana,'' an opus for big band; he will conduct it here with the Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, a resident ensemble of Jazz at Lincoln Center. Mr. Valdes, who turned 88 this week, will also play the piano with musicians culled from the ranks of the orchestra, including some who appeared on the album. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $37.50 to $127.50. (Chinen)

Opera

'LA BOHEME' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Updated to the years around World War I, this is one of the New York City Opera's best productions. A new cast has taken over, including two singers new to the company, Inna Dukach as Mimi and Robert Gardner as Marcello. Dinyar Vania will sing Rodolfo; Dana Beth Miller is the Musetta; Kyungmook Yum is Schaunard; and Eric Jordan is Colline. Steven Mosteller conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Anne Midgette)

'CARMEN' (Wednesday) Rinat Shaham, who made her company debut as Zerlina, is a small singer for Carmen; worse, New York City Opera's production seems to have veiled her spark, rendering her a mere stereotype. Her Don Jose, Mark Duffin, has warm lower notes and a pressed, often flat sound on top; the Escamillo is Adrian Gans, who made his company debut in the role. The high point is Latonia Moore, a radiant-voiced Micaela. Ari Pelto conducts, a little woodenly but competently enough. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Midgette)

'The ELIxIr of love' (Tonight, Sunday and Thursday) The director Jonathan Miller has created an all-American ''Elisir d'Amore,'' transposing the action to a vintage roadside diner to create something that's dramatically consistent but also dramatically slight. Yet ''Elixir'' is a delightful opera, and it's decently sung by Anna Skibinsky, an Adina with a little ribbon of a voice; John Tessier, an honest, solid, if North American Nemorino; and especially Jan Opalach, who has a lot of fun and sounds very good as Dulcamara. George Manahan's conducting is not exactly Italianate. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Midgette)

'FAUST' (Monday and Thursday) Gounod's lush score is back at the Metropolitan Opera in Andrei Serban's staging, now less hyperactive than when it was introduced in 2005. Alas, someone appears to have gotten to its soul before Mephistopheles had the chance: the singers, though all fine, put the drama at arm's length, so the work's intense passions don't quite come through. The cast includes Ramon Vargas in the title role, Ruth Ann Swenson as Marguerite, and Ildar Abdrazakov as Mephistopheles, with Bertrand de Billy conducting. On Thursday Darina Takova takes over the role of Marguerite, and Fernando de la Mora replaces Mr. Vargas. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Allan Kozinn)

'LA GIOCONDA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) This wild and woolly exercise in hate and mayhem continues at the Metropolitan Opera, with stirring music, old-fashioned production values and a strong cast that includes Violeta Urmana, Olga Borodina and Aquiles Machado. On Wednesday Aprile Millo replaces Ms. Urmana. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Bernard Holland)

* 'IDOMENEO' (Tomorrow) Those who count on Ben Heppner to sing the heldentenor repertory may be surprised to hear him in the title role of Mozart's 1781 opera seria. But this role of the tormented king of Crete after the Trojan War has heroic dimensions, dramatically and vocally, which Mr. Heppner relishes in his clarion and compelling yet elegantly Mozartean portrayal. The rich-voiced mezzo-soprano Kristine Jepson is Idomeneo's devoted son Idamante. In the crucial role of Ilia, Nicole Heaston takes the place of Dorothea Roschmann in tomorrow's performance. James Levine conducts. Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's 1982 production is still handsome and effective. At 1 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $320. (Anthony Tommasini)

* 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tuesday) The abstract staging in Anthony Minghella's 0visually beautiful production deftly employs movable screens, billowing fabrics, stylized costumes and a life-size puppet manipulated by three black-clad puppeteers to portray Butterfly's 3-year-old son. Vocally, neither of the leads, the earthy-voiced soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domas as Butterfly and the robustly Italianate tenor Marcello Giordani as Pinkerton, is ideal. But they do honorable work. Asher Fisch conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini)

'THE MERRY WIDOW' (Tonight and tomorrow, and Sunday) The enterprising Dicapo Opera Theater has some ambitious productions lined up, including a revised version of ''Therese Raquin'' by Tobias Picker, who composed ''An American Tragedy'' for the Met. But Dicapo opens its season with a new production by Michael Capasso of this frothy, tuneful and worldly-wise Lehar operetta. It will use spoken dialogue that was essentially rewritten by the playwright Wendy Wasserstein. Constantine Kitsopoulos conducts. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $47.50. (Tommasini)

'ORPHEUS' (Tonight) Next season at Glimmerglass is under the star of Orpheus, not figuratively but literally: All four operas represent different takes on the Orpheus legend, from Offenbach's irreverent satire to Philip Glass's ''Orphee.'' In a kind of preview recital tonight, excerpts from all five operas (the others are by Monteverdi, Gluck and Haydn) will join other Orpheus songs by Vaughan Williams and Schubert. Among the good young singers are the sopranos Caroline Worra and Michael Maniaci -- yes, he's a man, and he will sing the lead in the Gluck/Berlioz version. At 7:30, Morgan Library, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 590-0392, www.themorgan.org; $45; $35 for members. (Midgette)

* 'DIE TOTE STADT' (Tomorrow) Erich Wolfgang Korngold is best known for his pioneering scores for swashbuckling Hollywood films of the 1930's. But in Germany in 1920, at 24, he was hailed as the brilliant and promising composer of a mysterious opera, ''Die Tote Stadt.'' The New York City Opera has revived its 1975 production of this work, which incorporates film elements, video projections and scrims to evoke the dreamlike story. The cast, though not ideal, is appealing, and George Manahan conducts a sweeping account of Korngold's lyrically sumptuous and theatrical music. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Tommasini)

'VIOLET FIRE' (Wednesday) Jon Gibson, best known as an early and steadfast member of the Philip Glass Ensemble, has created this multimedia opera about Nikola Tesla, the early-20th-century scientist and inventor who made early breakthroughs in radio broadcasting, electricity and robotics. Miriam Seidel wrote the libretto, and Terry O'Reilly (a director of the Mabou Mines theater company) directs the impressionistic staging. At 7:30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $40. (Kozinn)

'DIE ZAUBERFLOTE' (Tonight) The revival of Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's ''Zauberflote'' is under way at the Metropolitan Opera, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004. Isabel Bayrakdarian, who sings with a clear, bright, expressive soprano, is a radiant and believable Pamina, and Nathan Gunn uses his vibrant baritone and dramatic energy to create an instantly appealing Papageno. Their charisma somewhat overshadows Jonas Kaufmann as Tamino. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Vivien Schweitzer)

Classical Music

* AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA (Tonight) This orchestra opens its season with the world premieres of Michael Gantonska's ''After the Wings of Migratory Birds,'' Evan Ziporyn's ''Big Grenadilla,'' Brad Lubman's ''Fuzzy Logic'' and Corey Dargel's ''All the Notes and Rhythms I've Ever Loved.'' Also on the program are recent works by Michael Gandolfi and Susie Ibarra, and an oldie -- O.K., an American classic -- by Charles Ives. At 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 and $40. (Kozinn)

APOLLO'S FIRE BAROQUE ORCHESTRA (Thursday) ''Bach in Context'' is the title of the Miller Theater series, and this installment contextualizes Johann Sebastian by presenting him in tandem with his friend and rival Telemann, and letting the audience judge between them. The news is the New York debut of the renowned, Cleveland-based and reportedly excellent baroque orchestra Apollo's Fire. At 8 p.m., Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $35; $15 for students. (Midgette)

CAPPELLA ANDREA BARCA (Wednesday and Thursday) The estimable Hungarian pianist Andras Schiff brings his cutely named ensemble to Alice Tully Hall for two all-Mozart programs. At 8 p.m., Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30 to $56. (Holland)

* LEON FLEISHER (Thursday) After a neurological condition rendered his right hand nearly useless more than 40 years ago, the pianist Leon Fleisher, now 78, spent years performing only left-hand repertory. But thanks to new treatments, he has been making a remarkable comeback. His Carnegie Hall recital features some works from his new CD, ''Leon Fleisher: The Journey'' (Vangard Classics), including Bach's ''Capriccio on the Departure of His Most Dearly Beloved Brother'' and Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue in D minor (BWV 903) and Stravinsky's Serenade in A. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $26 to $88. (Schweitzer)

ANNE-MARIE MCDERMOTT (Thursday) Ms. McDermott, one of New York's more interesting pianists and musicians, has a go at Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations. At 10:30 p.m., Kaplan Penthouse, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30. (Holland)

MET CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Sunday) A new piece by the unquenchable Elliott Carter called ''In the Distances of Sleep'' will be offered by this adventurous and accomplished offshoot of James Levine's Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. The program includes Mozart's G Minor Piano Quartet and the Mendelssohn Octet. At 5 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $58 and $68. (Holland)

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow and Thursday) The Philharmonic's Young People's Concerts may not have the high profile that Leonard Bernstein once brought to them, but they tend to be well-planned and engaging. Tomorrow Delta David Gier conducts ''The Ages of Music: Baroque,'' the first in a series of programs that will survey music history. On the regular subscription series this week the brilliant American conductor David Robertson leads works by Stravinsky and Mozart, including a violin concerto by each, with Gil Shaham as soloist. Then on Thursday Avery Fisher Hall becomes a movie palace when the dynamic young Xian Zhang conducts Prokofiev's pulsating score for Sergei Eisenstein's epic film ''Alexander Nevsky'' (1938), while that cinematic masterpiece is screened. Don't bring popcorn. Today at 11 a.m., tomorrow at 2 (Young People's Concert) and 8 p.m., and Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $24 to $96; remaining tickets for the Young People's Concert are $8 to $24. (Tommasini)

'PROMENADE CONCERT' (Tonight) The ever-inventive George Steel has assembled a program of rarities, both light and serious, in the tradition of the popular (and popularly priced) Promenades concerts. For the occasion, Mr. Steel is conducting the Vox Vocal Ensemble and the Gotham City Orchestra, with Tiffany Jackson, soprano, and Alexandra Cooke, mezzo-soprano. The program includes music by Lalo, Gounod, Chabrier, Villette, Schmitt and Messiaen. At 8, Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $10. (Kozinn)

STEVE REICH TRIBUTE (Sunday) As part of its celebration of Steve Reich's 70th birthday, the Whitney Museum has assembled a four-hour concert of his music and the works of younger composers whose music he influenced. The selections run from Mr. Reich's early phase piece ''It's Gonna Rain'' (1965), through his classic scores of the 1970's and 80's (among them ''Clapping Music,'' ''Music for Mallet Instruments, Voice and Organ'' and ''Vermont Counterpoint'') and more recent works. The performers include several superb new-music bands -- Alarm Will Sound, the Prism Saxophone Quartet, So Percussion and Tactus -- as well as the flutist and conductor Ransom Wilson, and the guitarist Lee Ranaldo, of Sonic Youth. At 2 p.m., 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639, whitney.org; free with admission to the museum, which is $15; $10 for students and 62+. (Kozinn)

* PIETER WISPELWEY (Sunday) Beethoven's complete works for cello and piano have increasingly shown themselves to be a fine large-scale concert for a gifted cellist. Now taking on the corpus -- five sonatas and three sets of variations, with two intermissions -- is this Dutch cellist, whose last cycles in New York have been of the Bach suites. However, he has recorded the Beethoven, to great acclaim, with a regular recital partner who appears with him this weekend, the Croatian pianist Dejan Lazic. At 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $50. (Midgette)

BETONTANC (Thursday) This Slovenian company's press materials say it is composed of ''self-described dissidents, egocentrics, pop-demons, ideologists, pragmatists, humorists, etc.'' It comes to New York as part of the European Dream Festival. The dissidents and egocentrics will take on Dostoyevsky's ''Crime and Punishment'' in ''Wrestling Dostoyevsky.'' Sounds promising. (Through Oct. 21.) At 8.30 p.m., St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194; $15. (Roslyn Sulcas)

COMPLEXIONS (Tomorrow and Sunday) This group, formed by Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson, is known for attracting superb dancers who tend to be stronger than the choreography on offer. That may not be true this time, since the troupe is presenting Ulysses Dove's rarely seen ''Dancing on the Front Porch of Heaven,'' originally choreographed for the Royal Swedish Ballet. Also on the program is a new work, ''Hissy Fits,'' by Mr. Rhoden, and an excerpt from his hyperactive ''Anthem.'' Tomorrow at 7.30 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. (Sulcas)

* MERCE CUNNINGHAM DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) The repertory includes the latest in Merce Cunningham's technological experiments.

Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $44. (Rockwell)

'FOOD FOR THOUGHT' (Tonight through Sunday night) What was it Emma Goldman said about social revolutions and dance? Feed the hungry is the message of this program, whose many participants were chosen by Miguel Gutierrez (tonight), Wendy Blum (tomorrow) and Heidi Latsky (Sunday). At 8:30, Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, danspaceproject.org; $10; $5 with two cans of food. (Dunning)

'FRIDAYS @ NOON' (Today) Choreography by Karen Reedy and Sarah Van't Hul will be performed in this informal dance and discussion series. At noon, 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; free. (Dunning)

* GARTH FAGAN DANCE (Tuesday through Thursday) Garth Fagan's limpid, calligraphic dances will include a world premiere during this one-week run at the Joyce. Among other pieces from Mr. Fagan's repertory is last year's very briefly seen ''Life: Dark/Light,'' to the jazz violinist Billy Bang's ''Vietnam: The Aftermath.'' (Through Oct. 22.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7.30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $42. (Sulcas)

HENNING RUBSAM'S SENSEDANCE (Thursday) A new work, ''Merciless Beauty,'' from the German-born, New York City-based Mr. Rubsam, who works mostly in a balletic idiom but also draws from the worlds of jazz and social dance. His work can be uneven but almost always holds rewards. (Through Oct. 22.) At 8 p.m., Joyce Soho, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479; $25; artists and students, $15. (Sulcas)

* SYLVIE GUILLEM AND RUSSELL MALIPHANT (Tonight through Sunday) This star French ballerina, now segueing into modern dance, joins forces with the British dancer and choreographer Russell Maliphant for a four-part program called ''Push,'' the first result of the newly announced collaboration between City Center and the Sadler's Wells Theater in London. There will be two Guillem solos, one Maliphant solo and a duet. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $35 to $85. (Rockwell)

RENNIE HARRIS (Tonight) Mr. Harris blends hip-hop poetry, rap music and movement and traditional African dance in ''Prince ScareKrow's Road to the Emerald City.'' A preview of the work is part of the Impact Festival, which focuses on human rights, social justice and political activism. At 8, Schimmel Center for the Arts, Pace University, 3 Spruce Street, between Park Row and Gold Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 253-7017, theatermania.com; $15 to $35. (Dunning)

ANNABELLA LENZA AND DAMAN HARUN (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Lenza will present a new work that deconstructs the ritual of the Roman Catholic Mass, and Mr. Harun will explore spirituality and religion in another new piece. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com and dnadance.org; $17. (Dunning)

* SARAH MICHELSON (Wednesday and Thursday) This star of downtown experimental modern dance gets her big Next Wave festival break with four performances of a piece called ''Dogs,'' commissioned by the Brooklyn Academy of Music and designed for its Harvey Theater space. (Through Oct. 21.) At 7:30 p.m., Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $40. (Rockwell)

MOLLIE O'BRIEN/MOB PRODUCTIONS (Thursday) Ms. O'Brien's quartet, ''Mammal,'' explores how aggression and force relate to intimacy and connection. (Through Oct. 22.) At 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com and dnadance.org; $17. (Dunning)

'PEAK PERFORMANCES' (Thursday) This series aims to provoke, and its choice, Jan Fabre, is said to be a first-rate provocateur. His new ''Quando l'uomo principale e una donna'' (''When the Leading Man Turns Out to Be a Woman'') is an homage to Yves Klein, who used nude women as paintbrushes. Mr. Fabre takes things further by coating the stage floor with olive oil. (Through Oct. 21.) At 7:30 p.m., Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, Normal Avenue, Montclair, (973) 655-5112, peakperfs.org; $35. (Dunning)

STEPHEN PETRONIO AND RACOCO PRODUCTIONS (Tomorrow and Thursday) Mr. Petronio and his quicksilver choreography company are featured tomorrow in the Dance at the Winter Garden series. Theater-dance pieces by Racoco Productions on Thursday draw on burlesque and clown and mask work, integrating them with outsider and fine art and traditional dance movement. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Thursday at 12:30 p.m., World Financial Center, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, stephenpetronio.com, racoco.org; free. (Dunning)

SPRINGDANCE DIALOGUE (Tonight and tomorrow night) The American component of this international festival based in the Netherlands ends with work by Myriam Gourfink and Nami Yamamoto tonight and Kristyna Lhotakova, Tatiana Gordeeva and Levi Gonzalez tomorrow. At 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $20; artists, members, students and 65+, $12. (Jack Anderson)

'WOMEN IN MOTION: LIGHT' (Tomorrow) This dance and film program includes work by Jennifer Nugent, Sara Joel, Karen Bernard, Lindsey Dietz Marchant and Ezra Caldwell. At 8 p.m., Morocco's Academy of Middle Eastern Dance, 6 West 20th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $15. (Dunning)

Museums

AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'A DEAF ARTIST IN EARLY AMERICA: THE WORLDS OF JOHN BREWSTER JR.,' through Jan. 7. Few early American artists painted more incisive and empathetic likenesses than John Brewster Jr. (1766-1854), the subject of a fine traveling show at the American Folk Art Museum. And few worked under such potentially limiting circumstances: Brewster was born deaf before remedial help or a common signing language existed. The case the show makes for Brewster's physical condition's being reflected in his art is inconclusive, but the paintings are wonderful. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter)

* ASIA SOCIETY: 'GILDED SPLENDOR: TREASURES OF CHINA'S LIAO EMPIRE (907-1125),' through Dec. 31. For a thousand years the Khitan, who established the Liao Empire, were dismissed by Chinese historians, but they have been redeemed by late-20th-century archaeological discoveries. The evidence is laid out in this show of more than 200 objects excavated from tombs, temples and walled cities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. The first major display of Liao objects outside China, the show gives the lie to the Khitan as cultural nobodies. .Ceramics, wood carvings, painted screens and belts; bronze mirrors that studded the outside of the White Pagoda; writing instruments; and even an ancient spittoon add to the bite and flavor of this show. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Grace Glueck)

* FRICK COLLECTION: 'CIMABUE AND EARLY ITALIAN DEVOTIONAL PAINTING,' through Dec. 31. Weighing in at six works of art, with about 20 images among them, this is one of the most stupendous very small exhibitions most of us are likely to see. It reunites two small, beautiful, newly attributed panels by the Italian master Cimabue, whose turn toward naturalism increased the sense of space, gesture and feeling in Florentine painting, and helped set the Renaissance in motion. The panels, which depict a Virgin and Child Enthroned and a Flagellation and may be from the same altarpiece, are flanked by related works. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Roberta Smith)

* METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'BRUSH AND INK: THE CHINESE ART OF WRITING,' through Jan. 21. If painting and writing can be seen as modes of thinking, and they can, then this exhibition is as much a brainstorming session as an art exhibition, crackling with ideas and arguments every step of the way. It is also a sequence of moods, with impassioned voices calling out from the 80 scrolls and inscribed fans that line the galleries, which include colossal examples of contemporary 21st-century art that both depart from and preserve a tradition, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)

* THE MET: 'SEAN SCULLY: WALL OF LIGHT,' through Jan. 15. The capacious, day-lighted mezzanine galleries at the Met are the perfect setting for Sean Scully's bold and energizing ''Wall of Light'' paintings from the series he started in 1998. These large-scale oils on canvas wow the viewer with their scale, intensity of color and sheer dominance of space. All have this in common: They are richly painted surfaces of close-laid vertical and horizontal bars (he calls them bricks) whose arrangement suggests constructed walls of stone. Although they appear totally abstract, with their all-over arrangements of bars that superficially vary only in color, size and juxtaposition, they evoke landscapes, people, events, the work of other artists. (See above.) (Glueck)

* NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: LEGACIES: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS REFLECT ON SLAVERY, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's, a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)

RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION,' through Jan. 29. Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many Westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? Or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of Hindu ragas, Muslim hymns, and Punjabi folk tunes? This is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. Vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of Sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)

* THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: MARK GROTJAHN, through Jan. 7. Mining the early Modernist cusp where the figurative, the geometric, the spatial and the visionary still remain tangled, this Los-Angeles-based painter deploys his abstract pinwheel motifs on paper in eight brash, door-sized drawings. Multiple vanishing points destabilize radiating compositions that are variously Op and buzzy, darkly monochrome (and a little too pretentiously moody) or candy-color bright. In some works the motif is doubled and angled, decreasing the shield-like frontality and opening up new optical and spatial possibilities. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)

THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'PICASSO AND AMERICAN ART,' through Jan. 28. Despite the glamorous pictures in it, this is one of those dull affairs incubated in the world of academe: a walk-through slide show that states the obvious. Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' a picture of heavenly arrogance, hangs between Arshile Gorky's ''Artist and His Mother'' and de Kooning's ''Standing Man,'' terrific paintings too. We are meant to register the plain insinuation of Picasso's neo-Classicism, then move on. Next slide, please. The show ends with a virtual retrospective of Picasso-inspired works by Jasper Johns. In picture after picture, Johns buries allusions to the great Spaniard, aspiring presumably to Picasso's own late meditations on Velazquez. Except that even when he was old and running out of steam, Picasso still had joie de vivre. Johns doesn't so much enthrone Picasso as repeatedly entomb him. See above. (Michael Kimmelman)

Galleries: Chelsea

DONA NELSON The painter Dona Nelson is in midcareer, and her work process is more experimental than ever, on the evidence of the four large pieces in this show. One is made with layers of hosed-down pigment; another is festooned with ropes of stiffened cloth; a third is a rubbing from an earlier painting; a fourth is reversible. In messing around with form, Ms. Nelson lets beauty fall where it may, which makes her art feel exciting and awake. Thomas Erben Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, fourth floor, (212) 645-8701, thomaserben.com, through Oct. 21. (Cotter)

DARIO ROBLETO: 'FEAR AND TENDERNESS IN MEN' Minus the checklist, these works come across as mawkish facsimiles of conventional 20th-century assemblage, 19th-century funeral wreaths, homemade reliquaries or folk art. Their impact expands as you read the lists of materials involved: all kinds of artifacts of American wars, from shrapnel and battlefield dirt to soldiers' letters used to make pulp. But it all remains too visually inaccessible, in addition to being a bit presumptuous about the keepsakes of people no longer alive. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460, through Oct. 28. (Smith)

Last Chance

BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'LIONS, DRAGONS AND OTHER BEASTS: AQUAMANILIA OF THE MIDDLE AGES, VESSELS FOR CHURCH AND TABLE' Aquamanilia sounds like the latest perfume or sorbet but actually refers to the small, cunningly figurative medieval vessels used for ritual hand washing. Cast in sturdy, glowing copper alloy, most often in the form of lions with serpents on their backs, aquamanilia are now having their first exhibition, complete with lavish catalog. The show feels like a walk-in bestiary and is enhanced by striking abbreviations reminiscent of folk art. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, bgc.bard.edu; closes on Sunday. (Smith)

* GERALD DAVIS Growing up can be hell, especially if you're an art-loving sissy. This is more or less the story told by Mr. Davis's auspicious New York solo debut. The show is titled ''1986,'' for the year the artist entered his teens, and in several polished autobiographical drawings it illustrates a state of social and psychological crisis already in progress. John Connelly Presents, 625 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 337-9563; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)

TOMOO GOKITA: DRUNKO A whiz at drawing, this Tokyo-based artist is making his New York solo debut with a show of his first paintings, executed in black and white gouache on canvas. ATM Gallery, 619 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 375-0349, atmgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

ALICE KONTIZ Ambiguity is the thread in this compact show. Its various small sculptures do double duty as furniture, specifically as supports for other art. Formally, each piece looks at once designer-chic and job lot cheap. The gallery installation could be either a showroom or a living room. Or both, which is the point. Hudson Franklin, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1189; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)

ADAM MCEWEN Most of the more interesting artists these days work in several media and tend to approach ideas at a slant. The British-born Adam McEwen qualifies on both counts in a solo show of abstract paintings made with chewing gum and photographs of an apartment complex in Queens. Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3335, closes tomorrow. (Cotter)

TAYLOR MCKIMENS: 'THE DRIPS' In his second show this artist continues to make highly effective full-scale figures and installations that seem to have escaped from a comic book, which they have. His vision of down-and-out America has intensified and is now dominated by oozing, hairy, often faceless blobs called the Drips. Clementine, 623 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-5937; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

* RIVANE NEUENSCHWANDER: 'OTHER STORIES AND STORIES OF OTHERS' The New York gallery debut of this Brazilian artist is beautifully in step with the somewhat pious trend of making art out of almost nothing to circumvent the big, bad art market. In video, collages and typewriter drawings, randomness rules, and the centerpiece makes everyday magic from fans and bushels of bright tissue-paper circles. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

* SARA VANDERBEEK: 'MIRROR IN THE SKY' Ranging through 20th-century culture, this talented artist pushes set-up photography and photo appropriation in directions at once worldly and highly personal. By building, lighting and photographing little stage-set constructions festooned with cut-out images, buttons, beads, trinkets and sometimes glitter, she creates poetic, strange amalgams of sculpture, collage and photo montage, and cuts Modernism down to size. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

WALLPAPER LAB In this show 15 artists (including Douglas Gordon, Gary Simmons, Fred Tomaselli and Phoebe Washburn) adapt their art to the wallpaper format. The results vary tremendously, but it is always interesting to see how artistic ideas translate from one medium to another. Lennon, Weinberg, 514 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 941-0012; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

AARON YOUNG Before the opening of this show, Mr. Young hired a biker to rev up in the gallery and lay down DeKooningesque tracks of burnt rubber. He also installed painted bronze casts of street curbing and invited skateboarders to perform on them until some of the paint wore off and the gold-colored metal came through. Four ''trick,'' audience-participation paintings hang in the back gallery. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, between Hudson and Greenwich Streets, South Village, (212) 206-1290; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)

'ZOO STORY' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Francoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari and Katharina Fritsch, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, flcart.org; closes on Monday. (Ken Johnson)

HEADLINE: See You In the Funny Papers!

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
''Masters of American Comics'' is a landmark and a pleasure. For many people, I suspect, it will be a revelation too. 
 Organized by the Hammer Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, where it made a splash, it has come east cut in size and split between the far-flung Newark and Jewish museums, in which it looks cramped. Art Spiegelman, one of the masters, who helped instigate the exhibition, felt so aggrieved by the circumstances that at nearly the 11th hour he pulled his work.
This was a pity, for the obvious reasons, and also because the Jewish Museum scrambled to fill the gap he left by appending a half-baked display of superhero comic artists, some great although in general reinforcing the exact cliche about comics just being schlock for kids that the exhibition was conceived to undo. 
 Good grief. 
 Still, the show shouldn't be missed. It spotlights artists like Chris Ware and Gary Panter, amazing state-of-the-art talents and endearing in the tradition of all those shy, gifted kids who drew endlessly in their rooms when other kids wouldn't play with them, dreaming about someday telling the world, ''I told you so.''
 Well, that day has come. Mr. Ware's craftsmanship and supernatural ability to draw serve a singular, melancholy vision that mixes allusions to mechanical drawings, bygone comic artists, Charlie Brown and Superman (the caped crusader ''as signifier of lost illusions,'' as the show's co-curator John Carlin, puts it). Jimmy Corrigan is one of Mr. Ware's title characters and alter egos; the work is surpassingly sad and beautiful. 
 Mr. Panter, also a virtuoso, but rooted in punk, riffs on Goya and Picasso and Ukiyo-e prints and medieval illuminated manuscripts along with Dick Tracy and the Fantastic Four. His ''Jimbo'' comics turn Mr. Panter's evangelical past (raised in Texas, a missionary in Belfast), with an evangelist's stress on storytelling, into wild postapocalyptic fantasies. Forget Batman and Robin fantasy. Think Bosch and Blake.
 But we've gotten ahead of ourselves. The show tracks a century of formal comics invention (in Newark, mostly early strips; at the Jewish Museum, different comic book incarnations) through what are meant to be mini-retrospectives. This means Elzie Crisler Segar's ''Thimble Theater,'' which introduced Popeye (he was far, far darker than the spinach-addled television cartoon), and Milton Caniff's superstylish ''Terry and the Pirates.'' It means Frank King's languid ''Gasoline Alley'' and Chester Gould's ''Dick Tracy,'' which set the standard for hard-boiled grit and packed a visceral punch that came from tightly organized colors and shapes (Mr. Spiegelman calls it ''blueprint Expressionism'') until Mr. Gould went kind of gaga and launched Tracy into outer space to fight bad guys on the moon in a rocket-powered garbage can.
 ''Peanuts'' is also in the show, in Newark, where Mr. Spiegelman (he and I visited there the other day) pointed out how its creator, Charles M. Schulz, designed the strip to be readable on a small scale and in different formats: either laid out left to right or in a box. 
 The elegance of all great comics is that they capitalize on the medium's shifting limitations. Mr. Schulz drew for the new tabloids. He invented a kind of graphic minimalism, which came, chronologically, to dovetail in the most unexpected way with art world minimalism. The warm-puppy side of Charlie Brown disguised the strip's consistent psychological depth, until Mr. Schulz ran out of steam. Its simplicity belied the sophistication of his gossamer line.
 As a commercial enterprise, Mr. Spiegelman added, ''Peanuts'' was what he and underground artists of the 1960's and 70's like R. Crumb thought they were rebelling against. Now, he said, he can see the strip's finesse thanks to younger artists like Mr. Ware. 
 Mr. Schulz aside, comics aficionados will argue about which masters have been grievously excluded from the show. (Where's Charles Burns? Daniel Clowes? Lynda Barry? Milt Gross? Jules Feiffer? Alex Raymond?) That's a sure sign of the vitality of a field that has produced a slew of great artists over a century who haven't had their due in museums. 
 American comics arose partly because of new color-printing technologies that fueled circulation wars between Hearst and Pulitzer. The comic strip's first genius back then was Winsor McCay, a Midwesterner, born just after the Civil War, a sign painter who developed a vaudeville routine painting outdoors high above a paying crowd, and who also drew carnival posters. 
 Mr. McCay was as innovative an artist as America had at the turn of the 20th century. Working at The New York Herald, he early on drew a Sunday half-page feature called ''Little Sammy Sneeze.'' In it a toddler's ''ka-chow!'' cracks the black-outline frame of the comic's panel, as if it were a window, a joke exemplifying Mr. McCay's fixation on the artifice of his craft.
 His strip also conveyed a Midwesterner's goggle-eyed perspective on the metropolis. ''Little Nemo in Slumberland,'' which took over The Herald's Sunday supplement cover in 1905, married something of Muybridge's stop-action photography with Lewis Carroll to invent a phantasmagoric vision that guided a viewer's eye seamlessly across differently shaped candied panels. They magically blended to make a collective cogent abstraction out of the page: the essence of comics art. 
 Did I mention that Mr. McCay, in his ultra-finicky way, drew like a dream? With ''Nemo'' he did other strips like ''Dream of the Rarebit Fiend,'' in which a top-hatted dandy dashes along a city street that suddenly curves up and in on itself, becoming a tunnel, from which the bewildered fop slides (from one panel into the next) onto the seat of a bus, as if down a rabbit hole, saying he must have been dreaming. 
 A slew of second-rate imitators and a few genuine pioneers followed Mr. McCay. One pioneer, the German artist Lyonel Feininger, briefly worked for The Chicago Tribune and also explored the medium's formal devices. He turned the blank spaces between comic panels into architectural motifs, so that his pages had the look of late-19th-century buildings. And he drew changing landscapes that exploited the subtle color range of the early large-format Sunday supplements. 
 Mr. Feininger had what you might call a German sense of humor. In Newark his work is a little lusterless sandwiched between ''Nemo'' and George Herriman's great ''Krazy Kat,'' about which there is not much to add to a long history of praise except that it looks as fresh and modern as ever. 
 All great art invents a universe unto itself, and Mr. Herriman even invented his own language (a crazy quilt of Spanish, Yiddish, English and slang). His slapstick strip, anticipating Beckett, unfolds in a desert landscape whose surrealism also beat Surrealists to the punch. Rooted in doodling, Mr. Herriman's scratchy, elastic line revolutionized the art of comics, as did his canny psychologizing. You can see the influence throughout the show, particularly on Harvey Kurtzman's Mad magazine and Mr. Crumb's ''Zap'' comics.
 It's too bad that both Mr. Kurtzman and Mr. Crumb are shortchanged at the Jewish Museum. Mr. Kurtzman altered not just the comics business, with his taboo-stomping Mad, but helped liberate a whole generation of rebellious teenagers. He deserves better than a Mad cover or two and a ''Little Annie Fanny'' spread from Playboy, the gig that marked his decline. 
 Where are his thumbnail sketches, his early short humor comics, which were seeds for Mad, and which were in Los Angeles? At least one of Mr. Kurtzman's great war comics about Korea is here. ''Corpse on the Imjin!'' -- eschewing gung-ho propaganda -- turns hand-to-hand combat into pure visual poetry. It's a model of economy and dark human truth and, above all, of how the best comic artists organize and pace drama and text across a page.
 As for Mr. Crumb, he's still the Picasso of comics: the unavoidable influence on all younger artists. His early drawings here, done with his brother Charles, are shockingly good. If he can be a little fastidious sometimes, he's always ingenious and himself. The Jewish Museum cut out some of his racier works that had been in the exhibition in Los Angeles, lest they offend delicate visitors. Never mind the offense their exclusion does to the public's intelligence and the show's integrity. 
 I can't forget Will Eisner, master of the comic sweatshop. The show includes one of Mr. Eisner's drawings for a ''splash,'' or title, page of his ''Spirit'' strip, and the printed version of it, each of which has its own aura, and raises the issue central to comic art: What is an original? ''The Spirit,'' which had snappy cinematic ambitions, was full of vertiginous views of the big bad city. Mr. Eisner's later career as a graphic novelist, a term he coined, led him toward maudlin stories ruminating on God, but before that, he set a standard for the industry.
 And last but not least: Jack Kirby, whose ''Fantastic Four,'' ''Captain America'' and ''Thor'' crashed through Marvel Comics' gaudy pages into the 1970's. Their radicalism was plain to see. Being visual space busters, they have done more or less for the art of comics what Cubism did for painting.
 Forgive me. Mr. Kirby doesn't need Cubism to justify his work any more than the other masters here do. They're all heroes of an American tradition based on creative pragmatism.
 Superheroes, that is.

To the Editor:
 From the perspective of someone who teaches at a public university and has two children in public schools, I dispute Eugene Hickok's assertions in ''No Undergrad Left Behind'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 11).
It would seriously weaken the intellectual quality of universities' curriculums to subject them to the principles of educational administration -- restrictive and bureaucratically driven norms and agendas -- that have arisen in the wake of the No Child Left Behind Act. 
 I would hate to see universities duplicate the plight of public schools, where determined and creative teachers are hamstrung by a tepid common curriculum designed by a committee insensitive to the needs of any given classroom or the talents of any given teacher. 
 Is there a parent in America today who hasn't noticed that the schools' mantra has become ''teaching to the test''? Mr. Hickok's ideas threaten to stifle the intellectual vitality, for both faculty and students, of American higher education.

To the Editor:
 While it is distressing that a large number of college seniors failed a civics literacy test, it is not the university's job to remediate for the failures of No Child Left Behind. The job is to develop skills in critical analysis and communication. 
 Stating that higher education is ''seriously out of touch with much of America'' is code that a majority of academics happen to be liberal. Critical analysis defies indoctrination by the left or the right. 
 While I spend about 250 hours a year in the classroom, when class preparation, assessment of papers, advising of students and working with students on independent research projects are added, I can account for at least 50 hours any week that I am working at my job. 
 To add more classroom hours would take away from the time I spend truly educating my students.

To the Editor:
 Eugene Hickok writes as though the No Child Left Behind Act has solved the basic problems of K-12 education. All he needs is the banner shouting ''Mission Accomplished.''
 No Child Left Behind has never been seriously financed, and K-12 education remains in a deplorable state because the boomer generation has abandoned the World War II generation's willingness to tax itself and create the best educational system in the world. 
 Poor and working-class people pour out of this rickety system unprepared for college and, indeed, for life. Conversely, students who end up at the better universities can pass those civics exams and graduate on time. They've taken so many Advanced Placement courses they're sophomores before the flowers of their freshman year bloom. 
 The America the tax revolt has spawned is not pretty. It's two economic worlds, separate and unequal. Excellence costs money; mediocrity is cheap. It is time to get back to basics, though not the basics conservatives imagine.

To the Editor:
 I question Eugene Hickok's understanding of colleges and research universities.
 Our workday doesn't end when we finish teaching. We also conduct research, advise students, read each other's drafts and participate in committee work. A fair amount of our research is used to help with real-world problems. 
 Mr. Hickok questions the value of a course on the history of comic book art. I'm not a comic book historian, but even I know that Art Spiegelman's work on the Holocaust and on 9/11 is important, as is Pogo's classic statement, ''We have met the enemy and he is us.'' 
 If a professor who researches issues in bankruptcy ethics can come up with examples of why we need to study such ideas, shouldn't a former key player in American educational policy be able to do so as well?

The writer is a professor of law and the former dean of the University of Houston Law Center.

To the Editor:
 In arguing for reform in higher education, Eugene Hickok makes a telling comment. He writes that higher education ''is a culture that cherishes independence and freedom'' but one that is ''seriously out of touch with much of America.'' 
 Maybe what needs reforming are those institutions that no longer cherish independence and freedom, rather than those that do.
 Why is the right wing so fearful of independence and freedom? Indeed, those who speak in the service of conservative interests want to ''reform'' cultures of freedom and independence into cultures of policing and surveillance. This turns the notion of reform on its head. 
 If it is true that the culture of higher education is out of touch with much of America, how and why did America lose touch with its culture of freedom and independence and what can we do to get it back?

The writer is an associate professor of education at Montclair State University.

To the Editor:
 While Eugene Hickok expresses some responsible criticisms of the current state of higher education in the United States, he insists on raising the oft-repeated canard about faculty spending too little time teaching. 
 I would respond more fully to such silly claims if I did not have more than 150 exams and papers sitting on my desk awaiting grading.

HEADLINE: Just Asking to Be Caught, Thief Solves Joblessness

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
A man who could not find steady work came up with a plan to make it through the next few years until he could collect Social Security: He robbed a bank, handed the money to a guard and waited for the police. 
 On Wednesday, the man, Timothy J. Bowers, told a judge that a three-year prison sentence would suit him, and the judge obliged.
''At my age, the jobs available to me are minimum-wage jobs,'' Mr. Bowers, who will turn 63 in a few weeks, told the judge, Angela White. ''There is age discrimination out there.'' 
 Judge White told him: ''It's unfortunate you feel this is the only way to deal with the situation.''
 Mr. Bowers said he had been able to find only odd jobs after the drug wholesaler for which he made deliveries closed in 2003. He walked to a bank and handed a teller a note demanding cash in an envelope. The teller gave him four $20 bills and pushed a silent alarm.
 Mr. Bowers handed the money to a security guard standing in the lobby and told him it was his day to be a hero.
 He pleaded guilty to robbery, and a court-ordered psychological exam found him competent.
 The Columbus Dispatch reported that before the robbery, Mr. Bowers had handed his landlady the keys to his apartment, his mailbox and the laundry room and told her he would probably not be back.
 ''It's a pretty sad story when someone feels that's their only alternative,'' said Jeremy W. Dodgion, a defense lawyer, who described Mr. Bowers as ''a charming old man.''
 Prosecutors had considered arguing against putting Mr. Bowers in prison at taxpayer expense, but they worried he would do something more reckless to be put behind bars.
 ''It's not the financial plan I would choose, but it's a financial plan,'' the prosecutor, Dan Cable, said.

PERSON: Peter Henry Rossi 

HEADLINE: Peter H. Rossi, 84, Sociologist Who Studied Homelessness

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Peter H. Rossi, a prominent sociologist best known for documenting the changing face of American homelessness in the 1980's, died on Saturday at his home in Amherst, Mass. He was 84. 
 Professor Rossi died of natural causes, his family said.
At his death, Professor Rossi was Stuart A. Rice professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, where he had taught for many years. 
 He was also director emeritus of the Social and Demographic Research Institute at the university.
 Professor Rossi's most famous book was ''Down and Out in America: The Origins of Homelessness'' (University of Chicago, 1989). In it, he chronicled the shift in the nation's homeless population from the older white male denizens of post-World War II skid rows to a younger, larger group that included many more women, children and minorities.
 For the book, Professor Rossi and a team of researchers took to the streets of Chicago in 1985 and 1986 in one of the first systematic efforts to count the homeless. Their work suggested that the national homeless population was far lower than thought --300,000 to 500,000 people instead of the two million to three million often cited. The findings drew criticism from many advocates for the homeless.
 His other research also centered on the effectiveness of social programs in several areas, among them poverty, hunger and prison reform. Although he personally favored social policies that helped the disenfranchised, his work sought to determine objectively whether such programs actually worked. 
 As a result, it seemed to appeal equally to conservatives (who invoked it to highlight the failure of particular programs) and to liberals (who invoked it to argue for strengthening the same programs).
 Professor Rossi's other books include ''The Education of Catholic Americans'' (Aldine Publishing, 1966), with Andrew M. Greeley; ''Armed and Considered Dangerous: A Survey of Felons and Their Firearms'' (Aldine de Gruyter, 1986), with James D. Wright; and ''Of Human Bonding: Parent-Child Relations Across the Life Course'' (Aldine de Gruyter, 1990), written with his wife, Alice S. Rossi, a sociologist who was a founder of the National Organization for Women.
 Peter Henry Rossi was born on Dec. 27, 1921, in Queens. He earned a bachelor's in sociology from the City College of New York in 1943 and, after Army service in World War II, a doctorate in sociology from Columbia in 1951.
 After teaching at Harvard, Professor Rossi joined the faculty at the University of Chicago, where he also directed the National Opinion Research Center. He later taught at Johns Hopkins and joined the University of Massachusetts in 1974. He retired in 1992.
 Professor Rossi's first marriage ended in divorce. He married Alice Schaerr in 1951. Besides his wife, the Harriet Martineau professor emerita of sociology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, surviving are their three children, Kristin, of Keene, N.H.; Nina Bander of Turners Falls, Mass.; and Peter, an economist at the University of Chicago; and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: In Sex Arrests Hailed by Pirro, Little Jail Time

BYLINE: By SERGE F. KOVALESKI

 BODY:
In press releases she issued over six years, Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, trumpeted the arrests made in Internet sex stings that her office ran.
 By the time she left office at the end of 2005, that undercover pedophile operation had snared 111 men, including a Roman Catholic priest, a private-school headmaster, a New York City detective and a former Brooklyn prosecutor.
Now, as the Republican candidate for attorney general, Ms. Pirro has made her pursuit of these sex predators a central theme. Her campaign Web site says that the sting operation, which she started in the summer of 1999, led to the arrests of ''over 100 pedophiles -- with a 100 percent conviction rate.'' 
 While Ms. Pirro's press releases repeatedly pointed out that the crimes were felonies punishable by up to four years in state prison for each count, a review of the cases shows that the overwhelming majority of people received sentences that let them avoid extensive jail time. 
 In most nearby counties, prosecutors have had a higher rate of felony convictions in similar cases, because Ms. Pirro allowed nearly one in five defendants to plead down from felonies to misdemeanors, according to prosecutors' statistics.
 Only eight of the men prosecuted by Ms. Pirro were given outright prison sentences by judges, according to records from the district attorney's office. The rest, 93 percent, received some form of probation. ''In many cases, we asked for jail time and didn't get it,'' Ms. Pirro said.
 According to Lucian Chalfen, a spokesman for the current Westchester district attorney, Janet DiFiore, who has continued the sting program, 54 people indicted in the operation under Ms. Pirro received only probation, generally of five years. Mr. Chalfen said 46 others received so-called shock probation, which called for weekends behind bars. 
 Two cases went to trial. Both defendants were convicted, but one conviction was overturned on appeal, and the other will be appealed on similar grounds. 
 Ms. Pirro said that she wanted more prison sentences for those who were arrested in the stings, in which investigators posed as teenagers in chat rooms and in e-mail exchanges. It was generally the judges handling the cases who decided to give the defendants probation instead, she said.
 Asked about the felony charges that were dropped to misdemeanors by her office, Ms. Pirro said that the plea offers were decided ''on a case-by-case basis.''
 Other district attorneys' offices in counties of comparable size, like Nassau, as well as in larger ones, like Manhattan and Brooklyn, that have prosecuted Internet sex crimes involving the same statute that Ms. Pirro's office used -- attempting to disseminate indecent material to a minor -- seem more resistant to bargaining with defendants. 
 The Nassau County district attorney, Kathleen Rice, said that of the 40 individuals charged by her office since 2001 for trying to sexually entice minors over the Internet, 34 pleaded guilty to the initial felony charge and only one pleaded to a lesser count, harassment. Of the others, one was found guilty, one died and three cases are pending. 
 ''When we have someone arrested on the top count, my general position is, absolutely no pleas,'' Ms. Rice said.
 Of the 49 people indicted on the felony charge of attempting to disseminate indecent material to a minor in Manhattan between July 1999 and the end of 2005, all but three were convicted on that charge, said Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau.
 And Jonah Bruno, a spokesman for Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, said that his office had used the same statute to indict eight people since the spring of last year, when prosecutors started up a cybersex crimes unit.
 Two of the defendants pleaded guilty to the top charges and were required to register as sex offenders, Mr. Bruno said, adding that they received probation. The remaining six cases are still pending, he said.
 As for the convictions that resulted in probation under Ms. Pirro, one defendant, who was arrested in a sting in February 2003, and was sentenced to four weekends in jail and five years' probation, was caught again in December 2004 after engaging in sexually explicit online conversations with an investigator posing as a 14-year-old boy. As a result of the second offense, that man, Spencer Davis, a former sixth-grade science teacher and a wrestling coach, was sentenced to up to three years in prison, according to the district attorney's office.
 Ms. Pirro's perfect conviction record was broken on July 25 by an appeals court that overturned the conviction in one of the two sting cases that went to trial. In a one-paragraph ruling on the 100th case of the Westchester sting operation, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court reversed the 2005 conviction of Jeffrey Kozlow, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, because Ms. Pirro's office had failed to show that his Internet communications with an undercover police officer ''depicted sexual conduct,'' since they did not contain visual ''sexual images.'' 
 The defendant in the other case that went to trial, Paul Wicht, a former earth science teacher at Bronxville High School, intends to appeal his conviction of three counts of attempting to disseminate indecent material to a minor. The appeal is based on the decision in the Kozlow case, his lawyer, Scott L. Fenstermaker, said.
 Because 105 people charged during the course of the stings while Ms. Pirro was in office pleaded guilty -- either to felonies or misdemeanors -- they waived their right to appeal. Four other cases are pending, according to the Westchester prosecutor's office. 
 During the first three years of Ms. Pirro's cyberspace sex operation, people convicted of attempting to disseminate indecent material to a minor -- the main charge brought -- did not have to register on a sex offender list because state law did not require people convicted of such crimes to do so. 
 That changed in March 2002, when that felony was added to the list of sex offenses requiring registration. Anyone who had been convicted of that crime and was on probation -- generally five years under Ms. Pirro's stings -- or serving a jail sentence at the time of the change had to register. 
 In a telephone interview, Ms. Pirro expressed alarm at the Kozlow decision. She called it ''outrageous and frightening,'' adding that it added new urgency to the need to protect children from ''these deviants'' on the Internet.
 Ms. Pirro, who has expressed concern about recidivism among pedophiles, said the judges in the sting cases brought by her office were perhaps reluctant to be tougher because most of the men charged in the operation did not have criminal records. ''I cannot be prosecutor and judge at the same time. It is the provenance of judges to make the sentences,'' she said.
 Defense lawyers said that in cases like the ones Ms. Pirro brought, it was easier to get defendants who did not have criminal records to plead guilty, in part because they wanted to avoid the publicity of a trial. And the pleas to misdemeanor charges kept Ms. Pirro's conviction rate high.
 Bennett L. Gershman, a professor of law at Pace University in Westchester and a former Manhattan assistant district attorney, who is a frequent critic of Ms. Pirro's tactics, said that the lack of prison sentences in her sting cases also reflected the evidence developed in the operation.
 ''The responses by judges show that they think these cases are not strong enough, that the defendants are not culpable to the extent that they should receive prison terms,'' Mr. Gershman said. ''It seems that the court is looking at these cases more as social nuisances than serious criminal acts.''
 Among those arrested in Ms. Pirro's sting operation, conducted by her office's high-technology crimes bureau, were teachers, lawyers, a lighting technician for a rock band, an actuary, an auto mechanic, a postal worker, a medical student, a fitness trainer and a mathematician.
 ''People thought predators were guys in movie theaters or in parks wearing raincoats,'' Ms. Pirro said. ''We showed they are from every economic strata and professional field.''
 The vast majority of the cases in Ms. Pirro's undercover sting operation involved men exchanging written electronic communications with investigators whom they thought were teenage children, but in some instances the offenders also sent explicit sexual images over the Internet or were found to have pornography on their computers.
 For the most part, the arrests in the stings were made when the individuals arrived at prearranged locations thinking that they were going to meet the boys or girls they believed they had been communicating with over the Internet. 
 In a number of cases, these men had condoms and petroleum jelly with them, and, in some instances, showed up with props like handcuffs and rope. Sometimes, the adults even brought stuffed animals to give to the youngsters. 
 Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, lauded Ms. Pirro for pursuing Internet pedophiles and contended that her job had been made harder because state courts tended to impose more lenient sentences in such cases than federal courts do. ''I think what she has done is exactly the kind of aggressive prosecution effort that we need for this problem,'' Mr. Allen said. ''And if you can't get prison time, you are still creating a record, identifying an offender and providing a conviction, so that next time the sentence will be more substantial.''
 One former federal prosecutor, William I. Aronwald, a White Plains criminal defense lawyer who represented two men who were arrested in the stings, praised Ms. Pirro for being one of the first district attorneys in the state to pursue those kinds of sex cases ''full bore.''
 But he said that she tried to manipulate and overstate the significance of the operation for political gain.
 ''By constantly harping on the sex sting cases, I think that she was pandering to the bedroom community, hoping people would say that she was a crusader who took all these offenders off the streets,'' Mr. Aronwald said. 
 Ms. Pirro dismissed criticism from Mr. Aronwald and others that she had ignored more-important areas of law enforcement.
 ''We prosecuted and convicted about 100 made members and associates of organized crime for murder, loan-sharking, assault, organized criminal enterprises and gambling,'' she said. ''We prosecuted and convicted more than 200 corrupt officials.''

HEADLINE: Bombing Figure Admits Guilt in Plot on U.S. and British Targets 

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
A British man pleaded guilty here on Thursday to plotting to blow up financial targets in the United States and conduct ''dirty bomb'' attacks in Britain. 
 The man, Dhiren Barot, a Muslim convert, admitted planning to bomb the headquarters of the New York Stock Exchange and Citigroup in Manhattan, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington, and Prudential Financial in Newark.
 ''Explosions at these premises were clearly designed to kill as many people as possible,'' said the prosecutor, Edmund Lawson.
 Amid tight security at Woolwich Crown Court in South London, Mr. Barot pleaded guilty to conspiracy to murder, and prosecutors outlined the details of his confession. Mr. Barot, looking relaxed and typing on a laptop computer, spoke just to affirm his guilt.
 In addition to the United States plot, Mr. Barot planned to attack British targets in a conspiracy called the Gas Limos Project. Mr. Lawson said that it ''involved parking three limos with gas cylinders with explosives and detonating them in underground car parks,'' or garages.
 Mr. Barot also admitted a plan to detonate in Britain at least one dirty bomb, able to spew radioactive material in a small area. The prosecution said he had claimed that the dirty bomb was designed not to kill but ''rather to cause injury, fear, terror and chaos.''
 The planning does not seem to have reached an advanced stage. The prosecution said it had accepted Mr. Barot's assertion that no financing, vehicles or bomb-making equipment was in place.
 ''We are happy to confirm that because it's a true statement of fact,'' Mr. Lawson said.
 The British police arrested Mr. Barot in August 2004, after a security alert in the United States. The alert level was raised to high. Officers were posted at possible targets. Barricades were erected, and traffic using bridges and tunnels around Manhattan was restricted.
 The strong American response weeks before the presidential election attracted criticism. Because three years had passed since Mr. Barot had visited his potential targets and he was under tight British surveillance at the time, some Democrats accused the Bush administration of overstating the threat.
 ''I am concerned that every time something happens that's not good for President Bush, he plays this trump card, which is terrorism,'' Howard Dean, now chairman of the Democratic Party, said at the time.
 American officials said in 2004 that they believed that the plot was at an advanced stage, an assertion apparently contradicted by British prosecutors on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Keeping Those Hits Coming

BYLINE: By JOHN BRANCH

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
Near the campus of Georgia Tech, where the city stretches north to suburbia, is a gunmetal-gray building next to a McDonald's. Gray is a commercial district's camouflage, and the building blends into the scenery of sprawl. 
 There is no sign, no indication of what, or who, is inside. Just an intercom next to a locked steel door.
But an interior hallway, a sort of guestbook, is lined with framed gold and platinum records from some of hip-hop, rap and R&B's biggest stars: Beyonce, Ludacris, OutKast and Destiny's Child among them. In the back is a recording studio, a technical marvel with a hipster's vibe, part of an otherwise outwardly unremarkable building that helps spawn hit records. 
 And in a chair is Bob Whitfield. 
 In one world, he is an N.F.L. offensive tackle for the Giants. In this one, he is the owner and chief executive of Patchwerk Recording Studios. Sometimes he cannot believe he is here, either. 
 ''I tell you what, Toni Braxton was in here, and I almost felt like a groupie stalker,'' Whitfield said while visiting his studio during the Giants' recent bye week. ''I stood there with my mouth open, looking stupid. Then I thought, 'I can't believe I'm standing here with my mouth open, looking stupid. I got to be more cool than this.' '' 
 Patchwerk is a 7,500-square foot former art studio, renovated in a style best described as industrial cool. It is a place of exposed brick and glass block and spot lighting, with the best music equipment Whitfield's money can buy and about a dozen full-time employees who keep the beat.
 Ludacris recorded his first two albums at Patchwerk, back when it was in a rented house, since demolished for a parking lot, a few blocks from the current location.
 ''That's why it's so important to me,'' Ludacris said in a phone interview recently. ''Those guys, Bob and everyone there, were very good to me.''
 Whitfield, like Patchwerk, somehow manages to blend into the background. At 6 feet 5 inches and well more than 300 pounds, that is hard to do. It is even harder as a former first-round N.F.L. draft choice, the eighth overall selection of the Atlanta Falcons in 1992, playing your 15th season with your third team. 
 But offensive linemen are relatively anonymous, as football players go, and Whitfield is now a backup tackle. He likely will end his career quietly and relatively unnoticed. 
 But like Patchwerk Studios, Whitfield is something quite different when he opens up. He is funny and honest and smart, sometimes the class clown with a foul mouth, sometimes the introspective thinker still planning on completing his Stanford degree. 
 Both Whitfield and Patchwerk were born in Carson, Calif., a Los Angeles suburb whose middle-class neighborhoods sprouted from cabbage patches. 
 ''We said, 'Let's give homage to the 'hood,'' Whitfield said of the studio's name. ''Everybody who started it was from the 'hood.''
 Fourteen years ago, Whitfield, like other highly drafted rookies, found himself suddenly rich. His best friend soon had an idea on how to spend some money. Curtis Daniel called Whitfield to tell him about another friend from Carson -- John Austin, an aspiring rapper using the name Ras Kass.
 Whitfield helped pay for studio time for Austin and co-produced his first two albums. Along the way, Whitfield met music executives and decided to start his own label -- Patchwerk Records. 
 Whitfield was an economics major but a music-industry neophyte. He prepared by reading books and magazines, and by taking an audio-visual course at the Art Institute of Atlanta. He put a studio in the basement of his Atlanta house -- for a ''hot second,'' he said, until hunger suspended a well-attended recording session. 
 ''I forget what was in the refrigerator,'' Whitfield said, telling the story with a comedian's conviction and precision, the kind that makes him a popular interview subject in the Giants' locker room. ''But I purchased the food. It was for me. I planned to eat it. I did not say that we were going to share it. And they ate my food.''
 He moved the studio out in 1995, but Patchwerk did not have enough artists in its stable to keep the studio busy. So it began selling time, drumming up business as Atlanta's hip-hop and rap scene gained prominence. 
 Daniel, managing the studio as Patchwerk's chief operating officer, enticed Atlanta-based OutKast and their producers to take a look.
 ''I got 35 tickets for a Falcons' game from Bob,'' said Daniel, sitting in his Patchwerk office. ''I told them, you've got to come see our new studio.''
 Whitfield was surprised to learn those details of the story. 
 ''That's what it was?'' he said. ''The tickets? I thought I built a nice studio and they liked it. Hmmm. I guess the tickets did help.''
 OutKast's 1996 album, ''ATLiens,'' went platinum behind the single, ''Elevators,'' recorded at Patchwerk. 
 ''We did that song, then another, then some more,'' Whitfield said. ''And all of a sudden, we were legit.''
 Word spread to Ludacris and others. The producer and songwriter Jazze Pha has brought the likes of Braxton, Ciara, Nelly, Jagged Edge, T-I, Young Buck and TLC to Patchwerk.
 ''It's a great vibing place for me,'' he said in a phone interview recently. ''It's where I have created most of my hits in the last 10 years.''
 Patchwerk turned into a recording studio, not a record label, and Whitfield preferred it that way. He enjoyed the optimism of making records, not the stress of selling them.
 ''This is the place in the recording industry where you are always a star, because the record hasn't hit yet,'' Whitfield said. ''You don't have to worry -- is it a hit or not? Because, to me, it's always a hit in here.''
 He caressed the knobs of the mixing board in Studio 995, named for the house number of the former location. It is an intimate room where most recording is done.
 ''This is my favorite place,'' Whitfield said. ''Little fairies pop out of the board and make hit records. I tell everybody, come over to the small room, where the little fairies come out. That room over there, you'll be cutting a fat check.''
 Patchwerk is no place for wannabes on a whim. The big studio -- Studio 9000, ''that room over there'' -- rents for $200 an hour, or $2,775 for the day. 
 It features a softly lit room built around an enormous mixing console, the SSL J9000. Considered one of the industry's best, it looks lifted from the flight deck of movie-set space ship -- about 12 feet long, with hundreds of knobs and controls. 
 Through thick, wall-sized panes of glass is a wood-floored recording studio, big enough for a large choir. Three smaller isolation booths sit behind it. Each room rests on its own slab of concrete, so the vibrations from one do not affect the sound quality of another.
 The big studio, used for mixing records more than recording them, took about two years to design and build. It cost about $3 million, Whitfield said. 
 Daniel runs the day-to-day operation. Even when Whitfield was in Atlanta -- he played with the Falcons for 12 seasons before signing with Jacksonville in 2004 and the Giants in 2005 -- he kept his distance. His recent trip to the studio was his first in a couple of months. 
 ''I don't implement nothing,'' he said. ''I just think of it. You've got the front line, and I'm the general, with the binoculars.''
 What Whitfield sees from here is a bit blurry. A few days from turning 35, and in the first year of a three-year contract he signed with the Giantsin the off-season, he does not know how long he will play football. And despite making a good living in the recording business -- ''Not a football living, but yeah,'' he said -- he is entertaining offers to sell the studio. 
 ''For me and Curtis, we like the lessons we learned from this,'' Whitfield said. ''Whether it's putting up parking lots or making movies, the resolve you have to have to build something from scratch is what I'll take from it.'' 
 He walked past the gold and platinum albums in the hallway -- past those of Whitney Houston, Pink, Jay-Z -- and through the unmarked steel door, back into the bright sunshine. 
 Cars drove by as Whitfield waited to cross the street to a sandwich shop. The drivers did not give him, or his building, a second glance.

HEADLINE: Firefighters' World, the Fun As Well as the Deadly Games

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
It's not as if firefighters have an image problem. They have always been local heroes -- New York has long called them the city's bravest -- and since more than 300 of them died on Sept. 11, 2001, that image is shinier than ever.
 In fact, about the only embarrassing thing that can be said of firefighters is that they suffer, as a group, from being stereotyped as particularly sexy. In ''Into the Fire,'' a two-hour documentary that has its premiere on the History Channel tonight, one man repeats a favorite riddle. What do police officers and firefighters have in common? The answer: They all want to be firefighters. 
 Still, the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company saw the need to produce ''Into the Fire,'' which at first looks like a really glossy, really professional recruiting film. But Fireman's Fund also saw fit to hire the Oscar-, Emmy- and Peabody Award-winning Bill Couturie as director. This explains why the documentary grows into something much more.
 Mr. Couturie lets the firefighters, both men and women, tell their own stories. They work in big cities like Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles, as well as in the (sometimes volunteer) departments of smaller cities like Hudson, N.Y.; Alexandria, Va.; and Ipswich, Mass. Also included are firefighters in tiny New Auburn, Wis., where answering a call almost always means helping a friend, relative or neighbor.
 At first the film is all bonhomie and laughter. Just about everybody at one firehouse has a disparaging nickname, one man says with a good-natured smile, because ''ego deflation is the No. 1 sport in our fire department.'' 
 One group of firefighters starred in a lottery commercial, and they are such good guys that they donated their fee to buy thermal imaging cameras for the department. ''Into the Fire'' even throws in some comic silent film clips about fires. 
 Then, just as this cheerfulness is becoming tiresome, one veteran firefighter describes his memories of a mother being told that her child is dead. ''I don't want to hear that scream again,'' he says. Another man breaks down, trying to tell the story of failing to save an infant whose mother had desperately thrown her out the window to the firefighters.
 There are horrifying stories of devastating forest fires and of earthquakes. There is a particularly gruesome account of one man who was so badly burned on the job that ''all my skin had just melted.'' He tries to describe the indescribable pain of being treated by doctors with something that seemed to him very much like a scouring pad. 
 Firefighters have families, of course, but one of the points of ''Into the Fire'' is that personal lives can never interfere with duty. One Washington firefighter recalls being called to the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001. It would have been nice to pick up her child on that terrifying day (her husband, a Washington police officer, was unavailable for job reasons, too), but she carried on and did her job.
 Mr. Couturie's past projects include ''Common Threads: Stories From the Quilt,'' a documentary about the AIDS Names Project. So it should not be surprising that when his cameras focus on a wall of photographs of firefighters who fell on Sept. 11, their loss seems newly heartbreaking.

Into the Fire
History Channel, tonight at 8, Eastern and Pacific times; 7, Central time.

Directed by Bill Couturie. Conceived and produced by Fireman's Fund Insurance Company.

HEADLINE: Bush Says Lower Oil Prices Won't Blunt New-Fuel Push 

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
With a tailwind of strong political support behind them, advocates for renewable fuels declared Thursday that ethanol is here to stay and issued a call for greater research and investment to solve the challenges still preventing broader use.
 At a conference to promote bio-fuels, President Bush suggested that the push to wean America from its oil addiction would be a priority of the last two years of his presidency.
''Let me put it bluntly,'' Mr. Bush said. ''We are too dependent on oil.'' 
 Mr. Bush promised that his administration would continue to pay for research into breakthrough technologies in ethanol, hybrid vehicles and nuclear power, and would uphold tax credits that he said were encouraging private investment to flood into the sector. 
 While saying that corn-produced ethanol was good for farmers and good for the country's economy, he also said ethanol from noncorn crops, like wood chips and switchgrass, a tall, drought-resistant prairie grass, would be needed to supply enough of the fuel to substantially blunt America's dependence on oil.
 ''The low gas prices,'' he said, ''are not going to dim my enthusiasm to diversify from oil.''
 Mr. Bush's speech capped a two-day conference that featured government and industry leaders, including three members of Mr. Bush's cabinet, chief executives from Fortune 500 companies like Archer Daniels Midland and DuPont, and venture capitalists like Vinod Khosla.
 Industry groups, in particular the National Corn Growers Association, have been holding a series of meetings across the country in recent months to cheerlead for ethanol and biodiesel, which are at the center of broad efforts to overhaul the Midwestern farm economy.
 ''We are guided by the need to structure and scale renewable energy projects to be commercially viable and replicable,'' said Alexander Karsner, assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy at the Energy Department. 
 The conference was an unusual collaboration between the Energy and Agriculture Departments, which jointly organized the event.
 The Energy Department described some of its efforts to develop cheaper, more efficient ethanol from noncorn crops, but the central investment appeared to be $250 million over five years to "crack the technological barriers to developing wide-scale and cost-effective biofuels." 
 The critical issue is making a breakthrough in the cost of cellulosic ethanol, made from plant waste or nonedible crops. That fuel costs at least twice as much per gallon to produce today as corn-based ethanol.
 The ethanol boom is at the heart of farm state politics these days, and some attendees dismissed the carefully stage-managed celebration, which included rock music, but no opportunity to ask prominent speakers any questions.
 Some major issues were discussed. R. James Woolsey, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said federal subsidies for ethanol should be revised to allow the industry to be more self-supporting. He agreed with a suggestion by Mr. Khosla that subsidies should float according to the price of oil, moving higher when oil prices fall.
 Keith Collins, chief economist at the Agriculture Department, warned that if not carefully managed, the industry's heated rush to produce ethanol threatened to take too much land away from crop production for food. He said ethanol would consume 19 percent of corn production this year, up from 6 percent in 2000.
 That could push up corn prices and cause ripple effects on America's ability to export corn to places like China, where food demand is growing rapidly.
 Only one oil company -- Chevron -- was invited to the conference. The company is involved in several research initiatives with the Energy Department, some of them looking at ethanol and bio-diesel.
 BP, an oil company that invests in biofuels, was snubbed because of concerns that it might not be strong enough in its support of ethanol, said a person at an oil company who had been informed of the decision.
 Donald L. Paul, Chevron's chief technology officer, said in an interview that Chevron saw opportunities to help ''industrialize'' biofuels and ensure that they are sustainable over decades. ''Our view is that fuel diversification will be important,'' Dr. Paul said. ''To meet our fuel needs over the next 25 years we will have to add unconventional fuels, including biofuels. It will take every molecule.''
 But some questioned the oil industry's motives for seeming to support ethanol now when it fought so hard to keep it out of gasoline before. On Wednesday, Mr. Khosla, who helped start Sun Microsystems and has been stumping lately for biofuels and other alternative energy investments, accused the oil industry of trying to slow the effort to incorporate more ethanol into gasoline.
 ''Despite nice words from the American Petroleum Institute, make no mistake about it -- they are not interested in a rapid transition,'' Mr. Khosla said after a speech by Red Cavaney, president of the institute.
 Mr. Cavaney warned that a push to sell more of an 85 percent ethanol/15 percent gasoline blend could prove ''unnecessarily expensive and risky, especially in the earlier years.''
 ''If we are to encourage more long-term use of ethanol, we need to avoid surprising consumers with unanticipated problems.''
 He also cautioned against a ''patchwork of state-by-state laws mandating ethanol use,'' which could result in price spikes and fuel shortages similar to the situation when ''boutique fuels'' were introduced with different ingredients in different regions of the country at the end of the 1990's.
 Mr. Khosla accused the oil industry of trying to confine ethanol's role to 10 percent of gasoline at the pump, serving as a supplement to improve performance, which Mr. Cavaney said was the safest way to go. 
 Energy Secretary Samuel W. Bodman said in an interview that he had personally invited Mr. Khosla to speak because ''he has a viewpoint that has to be heard.''
 Patricia A. Woertz, the chief executive of Archer Daniels Midland, the biggest ethanol producer, said partnerships across different industries and heavy investment in research and infrastructure would be needed to transform biofuels from ''visionary to viable.''
 ''The question is not whether there will be a sustainable market for biofuels, but how big that market can or should that market become,'' Ms. Woertz said. 
 In his speech, Mr. Bush promised to push to make the research and development tax credit a permanent part of the tax code. And he said the flood of private investment into biofuels must continue.
 ''There is a lot of smart money in America going into energy diversification,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I hope you make a good return, and I think you will.''

HEADLINE: Ideas for Democrats: Focus on Energy and Security 

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''How the Democrats Can Win'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 8):
I am appalled that none of the contributors to your roundup focused on energy independence as a major campaign thrust for the Democrats. As Thomas L. Friedman and others have noted, we are financing both sides of the war on terrorism. 
 It seems like a no-brainer that we need political leadership that recognizes this fact and that will lead us to the use of alternative fuels. 
 We can help our economy, we can strike a major blow to terrorism, and we can help the environment.
 This may not be the only issue that's important in the coming election, but it is an issue that touches many bases. 
 Perhaps Democrats can gain control of Congress based on Republican incompetence and the downward spiral of the war in Iraq. But what are they going to do once they have that victory? 
 Not having a meaningful plan for energy independence would be a missed opportunity of the highest magnitude.

To the Editor:
 Re ''How the Democrats Can Win: Competence Sells'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 8):
 Hear, hear, for Rahm Emanuel's advice to the Democratic Party. 
 National security should be the focus of the Democrats' message in November. Not scandal, not blame, and not the tried-and-lost promise of advocacy on behalf of the average hard-working American (as compelling and morally important as it might be).
 Taking a page from Karl Rove's book and flipping the terrorism issue that the Republicans see as their core strength against them is the only way Democrats can win.

Ex-Governor of Virginia Won't Run for President
Mark Warner, the former Virginia governor who spent the past year working to establish himself as the biggest potential rival to Hillary Rodham Clinton for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, said he would not run for the White House. Mr. Warner had drawn interest among party leaders assessing the potential 2008 field both as a centrist Democrat elected in a Southern state and as a wealthy entrepreneur able to finance his own bid.

HEADLINE: South Korea Grapples With Competing Pressures as It Weighs Its Response to North Korea

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
South Korea, one of the few countries that can financially squeeze North Korea, slid into a bitter internal dispute Thursday over how to punish the North for its reported test of a nuclear device.
 After days of squabbling, the South Korean National Assembly passed a resolution on Thursday condemning North Korea's test. But some governing party lawmakers criticized the resolution because it did not refer to ''U.S. responsibility'' for the crisis.
South Korea's inability to make a quick decision reflects a divide among lawmakers over how to reconcile their so-called sunshine policy of engaging North Korea with American pressure for an economic blockade of the North. 
 The division at home leaves President Roh Moo-hyun without a consensus as he prepares to meet the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, in Beijing on Friday.
 The region will closely watch the meeting. Both China and South Korea have tried to engage North Korea. But they also compete for long-term influence there. Many South Koreans are unwilling to punish the North Koreans, partly because it would push the North closer to China.
 On Thursday, Liu Jianchao, a spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said, ''It's necessary to express clearly to North Korea that the nuclear test is the wrong practice.'' Mr. Liu added, however, that ''one can say that punishment isn't the goal.''
 In contrast to South Korea, Japan reacted swiftly to the reports of the North Korean nuclear test by imposing a ban on imports and ships from North Korea.
 In response, a North Korean official warned Thursday that the government would take ''strong countermeasures'' against Japan if it carried out the ban.
 ''The specific contents will become clear if you keep watching,'' Song Il-ho, the North Korean ambassador in charge of relations with Japan, told the Kyodo news agency in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital. ''We never speak empty words.''
 North Korea rattled the Japanese in 1998 by firing a missile that flew over Japan and crashed in the Pacific. A top governing party leader in South Korea highlighted the political divide on Thursday by warning against giving in to demands by conservatives that the country join the American-led Proliferation Security Initiative, which aims to intercept North Korean ships suspected of carrying weapons materials.
 Seoul's participation in the initiative ''could work as a detonator for a military clash,'' the party leader, Kim Keun-tae, said at a meeting with cabinet ministers.
 The main opposition Grand National Party issued its own statement demanding an end to two joint ventures with the North -- the Mount Kumgang tourism project, for which South Korea has provided North Korea over $900 million since 1998, and an industrial complex in Kaesong, where South Korean factories produce garments and kitchen utensils with low-wage North Korean workers.
 Lee Jong-seok, South Korea's unification minister in charge of relations with North Korea, told the National Assembly on Thursday that negotiations, as well as the sanctions being considered by the United Nations Security Council, were needed because ''North Korea is not a country that one can open up with pressure and sanctions alone.''
 President Roh has found himself caught between increasing American pressure to get tough with North Korea and strong resistance among members of his own liberal governing party.
 Conservative South Koreans called the North Korean nuclear threat a ''death penalty'' for the sunshine policy of promoting political reconciliation and economic cooperation with the North. They said billions of dollars funneled into the North -- in cash, aid and trade -- during eight years of engagement had helped North Korea divert its resources into weapons development.
 But liberals within and outside the president's camp say that although they are frustrated with the North Koreans, they see no other option but to engage them. Ending cooperative projects will only worsen inter-Korean relations and increase the danger of military clashes on the divided Korean Peninsula, they say.
 ''It's clear that the sunshine policy has succeeded between the two Koreas, and it could have been more successful were it not for the bad relations between North Korea and the United States,'' former President Kim Dae-jung, the architect of the engagement policy, said, according to the South Korean news media.

HEADLINE: Iran Defies Call to Drop Nuclear Plans 

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
The Iranian leadership is vowing to continue to defy an international demand to stop nuclear activities while refusing to condemn North Korea for its reported test of a small nuclear device.
 Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a speech on Tuesday that Iran would continue its uranium enrichment program, asserting, as other senior Iranian leaders have done, that the program was intended for peaceful civilian purposes.
 He said the decision was made easier by the fact that Iran voluntarily suspended enrichment three years ago, a cooperative gesture that proved fruitless. ''If we had not experienced that path, perhaps we would have criticized ourselves today,'' he said. ''But now we will pursue with a strong heart.'' 
 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in a speech on Tuesday that Iran would ''continue its path of dignity based on resistance, wisdom and without fear.''
 The government spokesman, Gholam Hossein Elham, while saying that ''Iran opposes any use of weapons of mass destruction,'' nevertheless blamed the United States for the nuclear test that North Korea said it conducted Monday. ''The root cause of this should be sought in the policy, behavior and method adopted by the rulers of the United States,'' he said Tuesday in his weekly news conference. 
 It appeared that Iran was emboldened by North Korea's action, and what seemed to be light penalties proposed Wednesday in the United Nations Security Council. Iran and North Korea face possible Security Council sanctions over nuclear activities. 
 ''It looks like the message of North Korea's test for Iran was that it can also continue its program,'' said Saeed Leylaz, an economist and political analyst in Tehran. ''They felt that if they act forcefully and confrontationally, they can also proceed with their program like North Korea.'' 
 Iran, unlike North Korea, contends that its program is for civilian purposes, and Ayatollah Khamenei has repeatedly spoken out against nuclear weapons. Although Iran's facilities are visited by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United States contends that Tehran is using its civilian nuclear activities as a cover for a nuclear weapons program. 
 In an editorial on Tuesday, Kargozaran, a moderate daily newspaper, said North Korea could proceed with its program because it had China as its ally. 
 ''The international community was less tough with North Korea, which has a nuclear bomb, than with Iran, which does not have a nuclear bomb,'' the newspaper said. 
 Iranians were mixed about whether Iran should continue with its nuclear program.
 Some said they felt strongly that their country should pursue nuclear weapons, and dismissed efforts by the United States to halt proliferation. ''A country that has nuclear bombs has no right to tell other countries that they should not have one,'' said Javad Tabatabai, a retired schoolteacher, as he browsed at a newsstand in north Tehran. ''We are a superpower in the region, and no one will dare to stop our program.'' 
 Others said just as strongly that Iran should give up the quest. ''People are hungry,'' said Armin Manouchehri, a 33-year-old mechanic. ''Why do we need a nuclear program when the government is not capable of controlling the inflation?'' Inflation is running in double digits in Iran, with items like bread and fuel rising even more. 
 Some people said they feared that the Security Council might be even tougher on Iran now. ''North Korea's tests will make the West more sensitive toward Iran because Iran is in a more sensitive place in the Middle East than North Korea,'' said Fazlali Mahmoudi, 80, a pharmacist. ''I am afraid that our leaders' policies would drag the country to the brink of war.''

HEADLINE: The Energy Mandate

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
James Carville, the legendary Clinton campaign adviser who coined the slogan, ''It's the economy, stupid,'' knows a gut issue when he sees one. So when Mr. Carville contacted me the other day to tell me about the newest gut issue his polling was turning up for candidates in the 2006 elections, I was all ears. 
 ''Energy independence,'' he said. ''It's now the No. 1 national security issue. It's become kind of a joke with us, because no matter how we ask the question, that's what comes up.'' 
 So, for instance, the Democracy Corps, a Democratic strategy group spearheaded by Mr. Carville and the former Clinton pollster Stan Greenberg, asked the following question in an Aug. 27 survey of likely voters: ''Which of the following would you say should be the two most important national security priorities for the administration and Congress over the next few years?'' 
 Coming in No. 1, with 42 percent, was ''reducing dependence on foreign oil.'' Coming in a distant second at 26 percent was ''combating terrorism.'' Coming in third at 25 percent was ''the war in Iraq,'' and tied at 21 percent were ''securing our ports, nuclear plants and chemical factories'' and ''addressing dangerous countries like Iran and North Korea.'' ''Strengthening America's military'' drew 12 percent. Mr. Carville also noted that because their polls are of ''likely voters,'' they have a slight Republican bias -- i.e., they aren't just polling a bunch of liberal greens.
 ''When we lay out different plans for how to deal with Iraq, any plan that also includes energy independence tops any other plan that doesn't,'' said Mr. Greenberg, who added that people are not expressing this view because they are worried about price, but because they are starting to understand that our oil dependence is fueling a host of really bad national security problems. ''There is frustration that leaders have not taken it up,'' he added. ''There is a sense that the public is ahead of the leaders, and there is actually a sense of relief when anyone talks about [energy independence] with any seriousness.''
 Mr. Greenberg said he started noticing this during this year's re-election campaign by Ed Rendell, the governor of Pennsylvania. When his Republican challenger, Lynn Swann, first jumped into the race, public polls showed the two candidates in a dead heat. Governor Rendell eventually pulled far ahead in the polls, though, and among the key issues that helped to separate him, said Mr. Greenberg, was the governor's stressing of alternative energy, and his ''PennSecurity Fuels Initiative'' to lessen dependence on foreign oil and grow the state's clean energy market. 
 What this means for Democratic Party candidates, argues Mr. Carville, is that it's no longer enough to have ''energy security'' as part of a 12-step plan for American renewal. No, it needs to become a defining issue of what Democrats are all about.
 It should ''not be part of an expanding litany, but rather a contracting narrative,'' explained Mr. Carville. ''It can't just be that we are for a woman's right to choose, and education and energy independence. This is the thing we need to get done above and beyond everything else.'' People should associate ''energy security'' with Democrats the way they associate ''tax cuts'' with Republicans, he argued. ''This is not something to add to the stew -- this is the stock.''
 The best way for a party that is often viewed as weak on national security to overcome that deficit is to be for energy independence, he noted. Indeed, nothing would be more potent for Democrats now than to capture energy security and all the issues that surround it -- from improving our trade deficit by not importing more oil to improving the climate to improving U.S. competitiveness by making us leaders in alternative fuels. 
 So does this mean the public would accept a gasoline or B.T.U. tax? No, said Mr. Greenberg. The public wants government to impose much higher auto mileage standards on Detroit and much more stringent energy codes on buildings and appliances. People want a tough regulatory response, a la California.
 Remember, Mr. Carville and Mr. Greenberg are professional campaign advisers. They get paid to get people elected -- not to offer feel-good nostrums. So when they tell you that their polling and focus groups around the country show that ''reducing dependence on foreign oil'' is voters' top national security priority, you know that this issue has finally arrived. The party that captures it most credibly will be rewarded. 
 Hello? Anybody listening?

HEADLINE: CHINA AND RUSSIA STALL SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE; David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
The American push to win Security Council backing for tough, swift sanctions against North Korea appeared to be set back by China and Russia on Thursday, in an echo of the obstacles the United States faces in a similar push to punish Iran.
 The United States circulated a softened draft resolution to the Security Council in response to North Korea's assertion that it conducted a nuclear test on Monday. The United States pressed for a vote by Friday, but China and Russia immediately signaled their opposition to critical parts of the measure and said they needed more time. On Thursday night, a new draft resolution was circulated, and Reuters quoted the Chinese and Russian ambassadors calling the revisions improvements.
China had sent an emissary to the White House, Tang Jiaxuan, who met with President Bush during the day and appeared to be walking a line between punishing North Korea and preventing the United States from taking measures that would seriously threaten the government, according to the deputy national security adviser, J. D. Crouch. 
 After the first new draft was circulated Thursday, a senior Bush administration official said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was considering a trip to Beijing, Seoul and Tokyo as early as next week to negotiate punitive steps over and above those that might be acceptable to the Security Council. 
 That draft dropped earlier Japanese amendments prohibiting North Korean ships from entering any port and North Korean aircraft from taking off or landing in any country. Japan is imposing its own new sanctions, including a ban on North Korean ships in Japanese waters.
 The draft still cited Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, which makes sanctions mandatory and suggests the possibility of military enforcement. China and Russia have consistently opposed Chapter VII enforcement for North Korea in the past. 
 The version circulated Thursday night retains stringent economic and weapons sanctions, but makes clear that the measures do not include military force, Reuters and The Associated Press reported. 
 The United States was able to win a unanimous Security Council resolution condemning North Korea's missile launchings last July only by dropping the reference to Chapter VII, but John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, said he would resist that step this time.
 ''In light of the fact that North Korea has claimed a test of a nuclear device, we need stronger language,'' he said.
 The latest draft drops the idea of a weapons embargo and keeps a provision to allow nations to inspect cargo to and from North Korea. The provision has aroused particular objections from China, which is wary of such interdiction moves being conducted off its coasts. American officials, while acknowledging how difficult it will be to win Security Council backing for the tough sanctions they prefer, insist that even a weaker resolution would send a strong signal of international condemnation.
 The draft still would require all countries to prevent the sale or transfer of arms, luxury goods and material related to North Korea's nuclear, ballistic missile and unconventional weapons programs. It also maintains a ban on travel by North Korean officials connected to those programs and a freeze on their assets.
 Mention of curbs on activities benefiting North Korea like ''counterfeiting, money-laundering or narcotics'' was dropped, but Mr. Bolton said those activities were covered by the resolution's freeze of North Korean assets, which includes those from ''illicit means.''
 The measure also calls on North Korea to return to the six-nation talks involving South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States that it walked out of 13 months ago.
 As for the international inspections, Mr. Bolton said that the United States already had the power to inspect cargo under the American-led Proliferation Security Initiative, a group of more than 70 countries that have pledged to seize illicit weapons as they move across oceans or are transported by air. But he said the United States wanted language in the resolution that would make it binding on all 192 member states of the United Nations.
 China and Russia had said they believed the steps recommended in the draft proposed by Washington earlier in the day could end up doing more harm than good. ''As we know in this problem and in this part of the world,'' Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador, said, ''some strong statements made by others in the Security Council have hurt the entire thing and have aggravated matters, so we do not want to repeat this on the level of the Security Council.''
 Sounding a note of exasperation, Mr. Bolton protested as ''simply incorrect'' the interpretation that Chapter VII sets a pretext for military force, as many countries at the United Nations believe it did in Iraq.
 ''It would require a separate resolution, if one were needed, to authorize force,'' he said.
 Mr. Bolton said the United States was determined to produce a decision by the end of the week.
 He began the week highlighting the unanimity of outrage over the North Korean move and expressing the conviction that in this instance the Council would act quickly and decisively.
 To those who might claim that the indecision encouraged Iran to believe that it had little to fear from the Security Council in next week's scheduled debate, Mr. Bolton expressed confidence that the Council would take firm action. ''I'm sure they're watching in Tehran,'' he said.
 Mr. Churkin said he had asked Mr. Bolton on Thursday morning not to call for a vote, ''but what happened, happened.''
 Mr. Churkin and Wang Guangya, the Chinese ambassador, said high-level negotiations over the resolution's terms were going on in major capitals over the weekend and ought not to be pre-empted by a hasty vote.
 ''Of course, some people are talking about a possible vote tomorrow,'' Mr. Wang said. ''I'm not sure, but I think we have to see the final text, because there are many common grounds that members agree, but there are some disagreements.''
 Mr. Bolton responded, ''We're certainly very much in favor of keeping all the diplomatic channels open, but we also want swift action and we shouldn't allow meetings and more meetings and more meetings and more meetings to be an excuse for inaction.''
 Mr. Wang said that Beijing thought the North Korean claim that it tested a nuclear device was an ''irresponsible action'' that had to be ''firmly opposed and condemned.''
 But, he added, ''More important, it should be helpful for leading to a solution of this issue by peaceful means.''
 Richard A. Grenell, Mr. Bolton's spokesman, said the Russians and Chinese were already blocking action on other issues before the Security Council regarding places like Zimbabwe, Sudan, Iran and Myanmar, formerly Burma. ''It's all right to keep talking if you are really going to get action, but not if it's just delay and delay and delay,'' he said.
 Asked if the United States would settle for a less than unanimous vote, Mr. Bolton said, ''We would always like the highest number of votes in the Security Council, and we have not given up on our efforts to achieve that, but we have also said that it's important what we send a very clear signal.''
 He said, ''We are going to continue to work on it, but we're not going to work on it at the cost of losing sending a swift and strong response.''

HEADLINE: Pataki Pushes for Vote Today On Moynihan Station Plan

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Eager to get a long-awaited $900 million project to transform the city's general post office into a train station under way before he leaves office, Gov. George E. Pataki is forcing a showdown today with Assembly Democrats over what is called Moynihan Station.
 But if Mr. Pataki expected Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker who has been critical of the state's plans, to budge, he appeared to be mistaken. Mr. Silver said yesterday that he ''will not approve the project in its current form.'' 
The project to turn the James A. Farley Post Office on Eighth Avenue into a grand adjunct to Pennsylvania Station has been stalled in Albany for months awaiting final approval. Mr. Silver, State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the leading candidate for governor, have repeatedly questioned financial details of the project and the state's potential liability for hidden costs.
 In addition, Mr. Silver said he favored a nascent, but far more comprehensive proposal to modernize and expand Penn Station on both sides of Eighth Avenue, between 31st and 33rd Streets, by demolishing Madison Square Garden and building a new arena at the back of the post office building. 
 The Pataki administration has attempted to force the issue by calling for an emergency meeting of the Public Authorities Control Board today to vote on the Moynihan project. The three-member board is controlled by the governor, Mr. Silver and Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader. Any vote to approve a project must be unanimous.
 At a news conference yesterday inside the Farley Building, Mr. Pataki insisted that the project should be approved because it is the right thing to do and the financing is in place. Any delays, he said, could jeopardize the financing, increase construction costs and force the state to lose a $50 million deposit on the purchase of the post office building, if the deal does not close by Dec. 31.
 Mr. Pataki was joined by construction union officials and members of the Municipal Art Society and the New York Landmarks Conservancy.
 ''The Moynihan Station project is one of the most important transportation projects in the country,'' he said. ''New York commuters are in desperate need of a redesigned and updated transit center.''
 Charles A. Gargano, the state's top economic development official, said that the Moynihan Project was the only one up for state approval. The larger proposal, which is referred to as Plan B or Phase II, must still wend its way through the approval process and requires another $1 billion for station renovations.
 Some state officials say that Mr. Silver appears intent on denying Governor Pataki and Mr. Gargano a victory for a project that has been 13 years in the making. The delays, Mr. Gargano said yesterday, were ''politics at its worst.''
 But critics contend that the state's financial plan is flawed.
 ''There are essential financial issues that must be resolved before the project goes forward, such as the total project costs and the exposure of the state and local governments to operating costs,'' said David Neustadt, a spokesman for the state comptroller.
 Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky said a state law adopted in January requires the authorities to conduct an appraisal before selling any assets, which, he said, the state had failed to do before it selected developers for the project and agreed to sell them certain development rights.
 Robin Stout, president of the state's Moynihan Station Development Corporation, disagreed sharply with Mr. Brodsky, the author of the law, saying that the project was ''fully compliant with the law.''
 At a public hearing about Moynihan Station in May, civic and business groups lauded both projects. But it has also become embroiled in politics. Democrats have complained that the Pataki administration is rushing through appointments and projects in a bid to create a legacy.
 Further complicating the matter, the Garden has lobbied in Albany against approving the Moynihan project now in the hope of preserving its leverage in negotiations with both the developers and the city. At the same time, the developers, who must put down $150 million when the deal closes, have curried favor with Mr. Gargano and separately with Mr. Spitzer, while trying to stay out of the line of fire.
 Mr. Silver said that Plan B provides far more transportation benefits for Metro North and Long Island Rail Road riders, as well as New Jersey Transit commuters, than does the Moynihan project. As for the estimated $1 billion cost of rehabilitating Penn Station, Mr. Silver said the developers should help pay for it.

HEADLINE: Faso Jabs Sharply at Spitzer, Who Assails 'Angry' Tone

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
John Faso aggressively attacked Eliot Spitzer as self-aggrandizing and politically timid last night in their final debate in the race for governor, while Mr. Spitzer -- who has rarely been so on the defensive -- denounced Mr. Faso's ''angry, extreme rhetoric.''
 Struggling to close a 50-point deficit in opinion polls, Mr. Faso unleashed a stream of harsh words throughout the hourlong televised debate, saying Mr. Spitzer, the state attorney general, had used ''bluster and intimidation'' in his prosecutions and twice calling him ''asleep at the switch'' as Medicaid fraud ran rampant.
Yet the clearest calculation of Mr. Faso, the Republican nominee, was to call Mr. Spitzer timid four times: once for not proposing steep tax cuts, twice for his plans to overhaul construction contracting, and once for not investigating State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi's misuse of a state worker to chauffeur his ailing wife. 
 Mr. Spitzer, a Democrat, has a reputation as a ruthless lawyer, and he laughed at the idea that he was anything less than aggressive, even bragging at one point that Time magazine had named him ''Crusader of the Year.'' 
 But Mr. Faso's strategy was to suggest that Mr. Spitzer was zealous in promoting himself as attorney general, and would be too compromised by ''special-interest friends,'' like labor allies, to cut spending and taxes.
 ''Mr. Spitzer's philosophy is more government, more taxes, more spending, more borrowing,'' Mr. Faso charged after Mr. Spitzer touted his $1 billion plan for stem cell research. ''My philosophy says, let's let individual entrepreneurs decide where they want to invest.''
 Again and again Mr. Spitzer defended himself and generally kept his cool, though he was chastised by the debate moderator a few times for going over his time limit. Mr. Spitzer repeated his campaign pledges to cut taxes by $6 billion and steer billions of dollars to public schools, transportation projects and job-creating programs.
 ''Mr. Faso wants to run against a mythology; perhaps he believes if he repeats something often enough, he can persuade himself it is true,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''Mr. Faso is the one who has been described by his own party leadership as an Albany insider, and after 16 years in the Assembly he quit to become a lobbyist.'' Mr. Faso, a lawyer, had lobbied at points while out of office.
 More than halfway through the debate, which was held in Buffalo and broadcast on public television, Mr. Spitzer got a little more personal and bemoaned ''all the angry, extreme rhetoric from my opponent.'' 
 Mr. Spitzer called Mr. Faso ''angry'' twice more: first for the repetition of attacks and then after Mr. Faso noted that Mr. Spitzer had received financial support from his wealthy father in his first race for attorney general. 
 Mr. Faso delivered each response with a smile and looked delighted with Mr. Spitzer's retorts after weeks of trying to provoke him and attract media attention to his candidacy.
 ''Mr. Faso, as his own party leaders have said, speaks from the extreme of his own party,'' Mr. Spitzer said, recalling that the state Republican chairman -- who once opposed Mr. Faso's candidacy -- had said Mr. Faso sounded like he was from ''La-La Land.''
 ''When the issue is how do we fund public education,'' Mr. Spitzer continued, ''he says cut the taxes for the rich. He has a George Bush, voodoo economics approach to how we solve these problems.''
 Perhaps the most controversial aspect of Mr. Spitzer's eight-year tenure as attorney general, his aggressive manner toward, and prosecutions of, financial and insurance companies, also set off a sharp exchange.
 Mr. Faso portrayed Mr. Spitzer as a press-release prosecutor, trumpeting wrongdoing but then failing to win major convictions. ''He has used bluster and intimidation to get his way,'' Mr. Faso said.
 Mr. Spitzer was quick with a retort. ''Mr. Faso loves to defend corporate corruption,'' he said. ''We opened up a snake pit of corruption in that sector. If those are the friends that Mr. Faso wants to justify, so be it.''
 Using almost all of the 20-odd debate questions to attack Mr. Spitzer, Mr. Faso was much more sharply critical than in their first debate last month, or than he has been on the campaign trail generally. Three times Mr. Faso invoked the Hevesi controversy to try to discredit Mr. Spitzer, at one point even bringing Mr. Hevesi's name into an attack on Mr. Spitzer's plan to rein in and perhaps cap Medicaid spending.
 ''We just heard two answers: yes, he wants to work towards a cap, but we'll work to switch some revenue sources,'' Mr. Faso said after Mr. Spitzer spoke. ''Maybe it was Alan Hevesi who came up with that plan for him.''
 And he also tweaked Mr. Spitzer for coming from a wealthy family, secretly accepting money from his father to pay for his 1994 campaign and living rent-free in a Fifth Avenue apartment building owned by his father. Insisting that New Yorkers pay too much in taxes, Mr. Faso said, ''Mr. Spitzer simply doesn't get it. Maybe because he doesn't pay any school property taxes himself.''
 Mr. Faso was elliptical on some details. Asked what he would do about illiteracy, he ended up arguing for more charter schools and a reform of labor laws that steer funds toward teachers and administrators. And he called for stronger support for financial aid for state university students, yet he did not say how he would come by the money, since he has also promised not to increase state spending in his first budget.
 If Mr. Faso is to have any hope in this race, Republicans close to his campaign said before the debate, he must forcefully present an attention-grabbing counterargument to Mr. Spitzer's promises to cut taxes, create jobs and overhaul the day-to-day management of government in Albany.
 Those are the same issues that Mr. Faso is championing, making matters more complicated for him.
 Mr. Spitzer has insisted that he can pay for his program without raising taxes, and is even running a ''read my lips'' commercial on television pledging that taxes will not rise in a Spitzer administration.
 Mr. Faso, with less than $1 million on hand and three and a half weeks to go before Election Day, has barely enough money for his own television advertising. An advertising blitz across the state can cost about $1 million a week; he has one ad, running in some upstate media markets, warning that the upstate economy would collapse under the weight of taxes and spending by Mr. Spitzer.
 Among the likely results of the advertising disparity between the two men, however, is that roughly the same numbers of New York voters believe that taxes would go up under either Mr. Spitzer or Mr. Faso, according to a New York Times/CBS poll published late last month. 
 For now, the Faso strategy involves calling for more debates against Mr. Spitzer; trying to bank free media coverage with 14 town hall meetings around the state; and tying Mr. Spitzer to the controversy facing Mr. Hevesi, one of his Democratic allies. 
 Mr. Hevesi has admitted to using a state worker as a chauffeur for his wife for three years; last month he wrote the state a check for $82,688 to cover the cost.

HEADLINE: She Came Roaring Back; He Is Quietly Roaring

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
She doesn't remember. 
 Peter E. Bacanovic, his gall rising, could not believe it. But there it was in print. ''I honestly don't remember exactly what I was prosecuted for,'' Martha Stewart is quoted as saying in the September issue of Harper's Bazaar.
''It's a very striking comment to make, I mean she is on probation,'' Mr. Bacanovic said of his former friend, client and fellow convict, as he sat down for lunch last month at Sette Mezzo, just around the corner from his Manhattan town house.
 Five years ago, this Upper East Side restaurant, which caters to a select mix of society tastemakers, financial kingpins and television celebrities, was the epicenter of Mr. Bacanovic's world as a Merrill Lynch broker to the elite. On this day, however, a less effervescent Mr. Bacanovic shows up, one who seems more interested in venting about Ms. Stewart's memory than finding a friend's cheek to kiss. 
 His eyes are red and a resurgent bout of allergies gives him persistent sniffles. He also suffers from bronchitis bad enough that he frequently has to pause for breath when taking a flight of stairs.
 ''I am chronically sick and chronically unemployed and without any specific plan about how to proceed next.'' He pauses, taking special care to keep a promise he made to himself that he would no longer refer to Ms. Stewart by name. ''I will reserve comment on my co-defendant but it's very glaring to me to take such a cavalier outlook.''
 Susan Magrino, a spokeswoman for Ms. Stewart, said Ms. Stewart declined to comment.
 Ms. Stewart's new lease on life illustrates how her fate and that of Mr. Bacanovic have diverged since their release from prison. She is once again a television celebrity and retains her tight grip on the company that she founded. America loves a comeback story, and, if anything, her brush with the law may have given her a needed dose of vulnerability.
 Life for Mr. Bacanovic, who is 44 and recently completed his probation, has been a slow trudge through the slough of a legal and regulatory despond. Fired from his job at Merrill Lynch and banned from the securities industry, he is now struggling to find a permanent job and restore his tattered health and psyche.
 ''I was indicted not because I was the biggest criminal on the block or the biggest insider trader in history,'' he said. ''I was indicted simply to bring a case against my celebrity co-defendant. I was a device.''
 Mr. Bacanovic's feelings for his former client are complicated: there is resentment fueled by what he sees as the unfairness of his lot relative to hers, yet one that is tempered by warm memories of their shared love for chow chows and of Christmases spent together in the kitchen of Ms. Stewart's home in Westport, Conn. Still, it was more than a fancy for heavily furred dogs with blue-black tongues that bound the two of them together.
 The children of fathers with East European origins, Mr. Bacanovic and Ms. Stewart, 65, combined fierce professional ambition with a keen appreciation for the rewards that high society can confer.
 To some extent this bond may explain why Mr. Bacanovic remained loyal to Ms. Stewart through the ordeal, even though a guilty plea would surely have kept him out of prison. Loyalty to his friends has been a touchstone for Mr. Bacanovic; he says that he also did not want to become another Diana D. Brooks, the former chief executive of Sotheby's who turned against her former boss, A. Alfred Taubman, during the price-fixing scandal at the auction house.
 ''I'm not interested in lying to serve an overzealous 32-year-old prosecutor,'' Mr. Bacanovic said. ''I stood by my friend and client and told the truth. 
 ''I am also aware that if the reverse were possible, the same would not have been done for me. This was business and my co-defendant is first and foremost a businesswoman.''
 That Mr. Bacanovic should be frustrated with a legal system that landed him in prison and upended his life is no surprise. He notes that the trade at the center of his legal woes -- Ms. Stewart's sale of shares of ImClone Systems -- was one in which he made no money. Two other friends of Samuel D. Waksal, the former chief executive of ImClone, made more than $5 million selling the same ImClone stock. Insider-trading charges were dropped against them last year, and they paid a combined $2.7 million to settle with regulators. 
 His rage at the gossip pages is also understandable. Yet the degree to which he has turned against Ms. Stewart, whose connections propelled his career at Merrill, is surprising.
 His grievances are many. They range from not being among those who received a Christmas card from her while she was in prison, to her legal strategy. He claims that she turned down offers from the government to settle charges, which would have resulted in no trial and perhaps no prison term. He also blames her for the $75,000 fine he recently paid to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle insider trading charges. 
 In his view, Ms. Stewart could have reached her own settlement with the commission at any point between late 2004 and this spring, obviating the need for him to pay a fine. This April, as Ms. Stewart continued to delay, Mr. Bacanovic took matters into his hands and called Ms. Stewart's daughter, Alexis, a longtime friend of his who had introduced him to Ms. Stewart. 
 The family friendship no longer existed, but Mr. Bacanovic would ask one last favor -- if Ms. Stewart was going to trial, would she help pay his legal fees, as Merrill Lynch had stopped doing so. 
 ''I said, ''This is harming me,' '' Mr. Bacanovic, who had to borrow money to pay his fine, recalled saying. ''And she said, 'No one here feels we owe you anything.' '' 
 Ms. Stewart's daughter, through Ms. Magrino, declined to comment.
 It was a response that cut Mr. Bacanovic to the bone. ''I was shocked,'' he said. Ms. Stewart was holding him responsible for the nightmare they had lived together so painfully.
 But he conceded it was a fair inference to make. If Mr. Bacanovic had not called Ms. Stewart in December 2001 to inform her that Mr. Waksal was selling shares of his company, ImClone, there would have been no investigation or trial. 
 More than anything, he says he blames Ms. Stewart for the loss of his identity. In the public's mind, he may be known forever as Martha Stewart's broker.
 During his time in prison in Las Vegas, fellow inmates called him Broker and never bothered to learn his name. ''I am so tired of hearing her name attached to mine that the less I hear of it, the better my day is,'' he said.
 The years have taken a toll. His doctor has told him that his immune system has been decimated from years of stress. Sometimes, when he gets out of bed in the morning, he says he feels as if there is a mountain of bricks pressing down upon him. 
 On the surface, Mr. Bacanovic presents a calm, if unsmiling, face. Before sitting down to lunch, he shows off the Old World manners taught to him by his parents, both of whom emigrated here from Europe, and honed during his years spent in and around Manhattan's finest salons. 
 He bows slightly when meeting a woman and engages in polite, precise banter with the lunch crowd. His dress, like his manners, is impeccable. His shirts are crisp with starch and not an unruly hair pokes out from his well-coifed head.
 But once he sits down, his eyes blink often as they scan the room around him. It is the look of someone who still feels hunted.
 ''I was personally attacked in the press,'' he said. ''I was pursued in every possible way.'' His eyes are red and wet, and this time it is not the allergies. ''A great many lives were harmed. This goes far beyond the legal system. What was there in these allegations to warrant this? Is the guy a murderer, a child molester?''
 Certainly not. But at some point during the early months of 2002, Mr. Bacanovic's single-minded dedication to Ms. Stewart's interests caused him to cross a more oblique line even though, after six weeks of testimony during his trial, it is still not entirely clear who said what to whom.
 ''The only people who know for sure what happened didn't testify,'' said Henry M. Blodget, the former Merrill Lynch analyst who wrote about the trial for Slate. ''The real lesson here is that perception is reality. I can't blame the jury.''
 But Mr. Bacanovic, who was convicted on two charges of not telling the truth to investigators, still seems troubled by the verdict. ''This whole case was about lying,'' he said, referring to a government witness who was accused of perjury and a juror who lied about his past. (Ms. Stewart's and Mr. Bacanovic's request for a new trial on this basis was denied by an appeals court.)
 Having reached a settlement with the S.E.C. over his insider trading charges, Mr. Bacanovic has allowed himself to look toward resuming some measure of a normal life. He refuses to give any details, but says he has been looking into careers in film, advertising and real estate. He now spends much of his time in Los Angeles, where he lives alone in a house that he rents. But the past still haunts him.
 ''I've spent a great deal of time thinking about my obituary in the last four years,'' he said. ''I would really rather my tombstone not read 'broker, Martha' with dates. I'd rather it read 'Bacanovic, Peter.' ''


CORRECTION-DATE: October 18, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Friday about the life of Peter E. Bacanovic, the former broker for Martha Stewart, since both were released from prison, incorrectly described a communication he had with Ms. Stewart in December 2001. Mr. Bacanovic called Ms. Stewart at that time and left a message about ImClone Systems; he did not talk to her about Samuel D. Waksal, then the chief executive of ImClone, selling his shares in the company. According to the government's indictment, a brokerage sales assistant told Ms. Stewart about Mr. Waksal's selling of the shares.

HEADLINE: A Growing Free-for-All

 BODY:
By approving the merger between AT&T and BellSouth unconditionally, the Bush administration has again abdicated responsibility for protecting consumers when huge companies combine.
 Fierce competition between private companies is at the core of the nation's economic strength. But government still has an important role to play as referee, making sure that the rough-and-tumble game of capitalism doesn't become perversely uncompetitive through significant concentrations of market power in the hands of a few companies. 
From the very start, the Bush administration's approach to antitrust and merger policy has been much more hands-off than its predecessors'. In an era of rapid consolidation and deregulation, the Justice Department hasn't brought a single major monopoly case under the Sherman Antitrust Act since the Clinton administration went after Microsoft for illegally defending its monopoly for the Windows operating system. The department settled that case during President Bush's first year in office.
 That set the tone for a merger policy that often appears to be little more than ''anything goes.'' One gets the impression at times that the referee has left the playing field. 
 Perhaps the clearest example came earlier this year when the department cleared Whirlpool's $1.7 billion acquisition of Maytag, which gave the combined company up to three-quarters of the market for some home appliances. As Stephen Labaton reported in The Times shortly thereafter, that decision actually demoralized career officials in the department's antitrust division. 
 Not only has the government failed to bring many significant cases, it is opposing one brought and won by a third party. The Supreme Court will hear a case in which a jury found that Weyerhaeuser monopolized a market for logs in the Pacific Northwest. The Bush administration filed a brief asking the court to reverse the decision, already upheld on appeal.
 A federal district judge is reviewing the antitrust settlements that previously allowed SBC Communications to acquire AT&T and Verizon to buy MCI. But by approving the AT&T-BellSouth merger without a single condition, the Justice Department has allowed this one to avoid judicial review. 
 That leaves the Federal Communications Commission. The commission has scheduled a meeting to discuss the merger today. It should take a long, hard look at the deal, and the overall trend toward consolidation in the telecommunications industry. There are strong arguments that competition with cable companies and Internet phone services have changed the playing field. But the commissioners should pursue the question thoroughly rather than wielding a rubber stamp as the Justice Department sometimes appears to. They must think first about protecting consumers, while bearing in mind that bigger is not always better.

HEADLINE: Seeing Something to Cheer in a Big but Stabilizing Inventory of Homes 

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
IN the United States, the news for home builders seems dismal. The National Association of Realtors forecast this week that new-home prices in 2006 will show an annual decline for the first time since 1991. The inventory of houses for sale is at the highest level in history and some economists say a housing slowdown could bring on a recession.
 But the stock market, which hated home builders for much of 2006, now thinks it sees signs of hope. One Wall Street analyst, Michael Rehaut of J. P. Morgan, pointed to inventory numbers, of all things, as a reason for optimism as he raised ratings on some builders this week. 
At first glance, such an opinion seems absurd. The first chart shows the number of homes and condominiums for sale at the end of each month. (Only existing condominiums, as opposed to newly constructed ones, are included, a fact that no doubt holds down the inventory level.)
 At the end of August, the latest figures available, there were 4.5 million homes and condos available for sale, more than double the number in late 2001 and up 35 percent from a year earlier. It was the highest figure ever.
 But as the second chart shows, the year-over-year growth in inventories peaked in May, with a 38 percent rise. 
 To Mr. Rehaut, that is significant. ''While pricing, orders and starts may still show negative trends in the near term,'' he wrote this week, ''we believe inventories -- the leading driver of the market's pullback, on our view, as well as our prior cautious stance -- have begun to stabilize and in turn should drive a market recovery.''
 The stock market is supposed to forecast the future, turning lower before the bad news and higher before the news grows good. In that regard, it got the decline right, with the Bloomberg United States home builder index, shown in the third chart, peaking in July 2005, when the housing sales statistics were running strong but the inventory numbers had started to edge up.
 From the record close to the low this summer, almost exactly a year later, that index fell 46 percent, although even then it was up more than 250 percent from the end of 1999. Since then, it has risen 20 percent, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up only 10 percent. Whether that stock market rebound will last is, of course, a subject of debate. While it is true that figures from HousingTracker.net show inventories of unsold homes have begun to slip in a few previously hot markets like San Diego and Washington, they remain at quite high levels. There is no guarantee that sales will not soften more.
 Declines in the number of homes for sale may come from owners taking their homes off the market because they are unwilling to accept the prices available, hardly a positive sign. And investors may have underestimated the damage already done. Centex's report of low profits and record cancellations of home purchase contracts --it blamed the inability of buyers to sell their existing homes -- caused housing shares to sink yesterday.
 A genuine bottom in the housing market would come as a great relief to Washington policy makers, who have been uncertain what would enable consumers to keep spending if they can no longer monetize rising real estate values and have been worried that exotic mortgages might bring great pain to homeowners who cannot afford to meet higher payments that will someday be required.

HEADLINE: Cheaper Gas Lifts Spending By Consumers

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Lower gasoline prices encouraged Americans to spend more on clothing, furniture and building materials, and propelled consumer confidence to the highest level in more than a year, according to reports released yesterday. 
 The largest decline ever in gas-station receipts pushed overall retail sales down 0.4 percent in September, the Commerce Department said. Excluding service stations, purchases climbed 0.6 percent, three times the gain in August.
In addition, the University of Michigan reported that its consumer sentiment index jumped to 92.3 in October, from 85.4 the prior month. It was the highest reading since July 2005.
 According to the Commerce Department, sales excluding autos, gasoline and building materials, which the government uses to calculate gross domestic product figures, increased 0.8 percent in September, the most since January. The gain was twice as much as in August.
 Sales excluding autos fell 0.5 percent in September after a 0.2 percent rise. No change was forecast by economists. Sales at automobile dealerships and parts stores were unchanged last month after a 0.4 percent decline in August.
 Purchases at nonstore retailers, including online and catalog sales, increased 1.1 percent in September after falling 0.2 percent the month before. Sales at department stores increased 1 percent after no change.
 The data suggests that housing has yet to take a big bite out of consumer spending. This week, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Richard W. Fisher, said that ''it's important not to over-fixate on housing'' because ''the rest of the economy is running on all pistons.''
 A healthy labor market is sustaining consumer spending. The unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent last month, matching a five-year low, and workers' average hourly earnings rose 4 percent from September 2005, matching the biggest gain in five years, the Labor Department said this month.

HEADLINE: Voters' Guides Define Moral Compromises to Take to Polls

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
Voters' guides have gone theological. ''Voting God's Politics.'' ''Voter's Guide for Serious Catholics.'' ''Voting for the Common Good: A Practical Guide for Conscientious Catholics.'' ''Voting With a Clear Conscience.'' And more.
 These are not the familiar guides that line up candidates by their views or votes on a list of selected issues and that, in some cases, give them ratings, a practice that has migrated from lobbies like those on gun control, tax cuts and environmental regulation to religious groups like the Christian Coalition.
No, the new voters' guides try to be mini-manuals of moral theology and church-state relations, offering voters a religious framework for making their choices, not endorsements of candidates or parties. 
 Of course, it isn't that simple. The complex entanglement of theology and politics is made clear in the case of competing Roman Catholic guides, a matter of political import in view of the belief that Catholics constitute a swing vote, especially in what are considered swing states. 
 For example, on the eve of every presidential election year since 1976, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops administrative board has issued a booklet raising questions for Catholics to consider as they carry out their political responsibilities. ''Faithful Citizenship,'' in its 2003 edition, emphasized that politics involved fundamental moral choices. While highlighting issues like abortion and euthanasia having to do with the protection of life, it also gave attention to other issues: warfare and terrorism and world poverty and health care, from marriage (''a lifelong commitment between a man and a woman'') and family life to job creation and racial discrimination. 
 ''Faithful Citizenship'' soon encountered competition, however, from a ''Voter's Guide for Serious Catholics'' prepared by a San Diego group now called Catholic Answers Action. It argued that Catholics should cast their votes based on candidates' positions on ''five nonnegotiable issues'': abortion, euthanasia, embryonic stem-cell research, human cloning and same-sex marriage. 
 Citing church documents, the pamphlet argued that unlike war or capital punishment, these issues involved actions that were ''intrinsically evil'' and ''must never be promoted by law.'' Ten million copies of the ''Voter's Guide for Serious Catholics'' were bought, reproduced and distributed during the 2004 presidential campaign, and a new version has been circulating for the November elections. 
 Now the pamphlet for ''serious Catholics'' has a competitor of its own, a guide for ''conscientious Catholics.'' Just issued by a new group, Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, ''Voting for the Common Good'' rejects the idea that the question of how Catholics should vote can be answered ''by applying a simple 'litmus test' of a few selected issues.'' 
 Echoing the bishops' ''Faithful Citizenship,'' it lists seven major themes of Catholic social teaching and mentions 19 issues in alphabetical order, from abortion and the death penalty to war and workers' rights.
 There are yet more variations on these guides. ''Voting With a Clear Conscience'' originates from Priests for Life. It, too, takes the nonnegotiables stance, but with language equating abortion, for example, with terrorism: ''Suppose a candidate came forward and said, 'I support terrorism.' Would you say, 'I disagree with you on terrorism, but what's your health care plan?' ''
 According to the guide, ''Any candidate who says abortion should be kept legal disqualifies him/herself from public service.'' 
 ''Voting God's Politics'' is very different. The product of Sojourners, a liberal monthly magazine with evangelical roots, this voters' guide gives seven brief headings like ''Compassion and Economic Justice'' or ''Peace and Restraint of Violence.'' Each is followed by a biblical passage and several recommended public policies. Some of these state general objectives (''develop clean, efficient and renewable energy sources''), and some get quite specific (''phased withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq that starts immediately'').
 The dueling guides from Catholic Answers Action and Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good directly challenge each other in the most interesting -- and, given their condensed formats, even the most thoughtful -- ways. 
 Both, of course, urge active participation in the political process. Both lean on official church statements from the bishops and Rome. 
 Both actually agree on what, after all, is the radioactive issue in this whole debate: the moral status of abortion. One guide highlights abortion among the five nonnegotiable issues; the other lists it among four ''affronts to human life''-- abortion, poverty, torture and war.
 And both recognize the inevitability of compromise in political life, which is where things get interesting. 
 ''Where all of the available candidates take morally unacceptable positions on one or more of the nonnegotiable issues,'' the Catholic Answers Action guide says, ''a citizen will be called upon to make tough choices.'' 
 The Catholics in Alliance guide says, ''Since we seldom, if ever, have the opportunity to vote for a candidate with the right positions on all the issues important to Catholics, we often must vote for some candidates who may hold the 'wrong' Catholic position on some issues in order to maximize the good our vote achieves in other areas.'' 
 At this point the two guides diverge. 
 Catholic Answers Action demands that all ''tough choices'' be made within the limits of the five nonnegotiables. It would be legitimate, for example, to vote for a candidate favoring embryonic stem-cell research but at least opposing euthanasia and same-sex marriage. It would be illegitimate to support a candidate aggressive about combating global poverty or preventing genocide in Darfur but favoring embryonic stem-cell research. 
 The Catholics in Alliance guide rejects this approach.
 In addition, the Catholic Answers Action guide always emphasizes candidates' positions. Legitimate compromise, it suggests, involves supporting a candidate with one or more disapproved public stances on central moral issues because he holds other, approved ones. 
 By contrast, the Catholics in Alliance guide says compromise can encompass political effectiveness as well. It compares, for example, candidates who support ending abortion but who ''don't produce results'' with ''candidates who don't believe in making abortions illegal'' but support measures that might reduce the number of abortions. 
 At stake are contrasting responses to the reality of political compromise. In this case, one is focused on the preservation of moral principle, and the other on the moral claims of the practical.

HEADLINE: The Kids Are All Right

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
In 1968, the year after the U.S. population reached 200 million, Linus Pauling, Jonas Salk and other scientific luminaries signed their names to a full-page advertisement. It pictured a beatific baby in diapers who was labeled, in large letters, ''Threat to Peace.''
 ''It is only being realistic,'' the scientists warned, ''to say that skyrocketing population growth may doom the world we live in.'' They shared the concerns of Paul Ehrlich, who was on the best-seller lists warning of unprecedented famines overseas in the 1970's and food riots on the streets of America in the 1980's. 
On Tuesday morning, when the 300 millionth American is born, the parents will not be worrying about a national shortage of food. If anything, they'll worry about their child becoming obese. There is more food available per person -- in America and the rest of the world -- than ever imagined by the 1960's doomsayers, Malthus or the ancient Greek philosophers who discussed the need for population control. 
 ''Overpopulation'' is history's oldest environmental crisis, and it's the most instructive for making sense of today's debates about energy and climate change. It's a case study of intellectual arrogance, and of the perils of putting too much faith in a ''scientific consensus'' of experts infatuated with their own forecasts.
 Four decades ago, scientists were so determined to prevent famines that they analyzed the feasibility of putting ''fertility control agents'' in public drinking water. The physicist William Shockley suggested using sterilization to impose a national limit on the number of births.
 Planned Parenthood's policy of relying on voluntary birth control was called a ''tragic ideal'' by the ecologist Garrett Hardin. Writing in the journal Science, Hardin argued that ''freedom to breed will bring ruin to all.'' He and others urged America to adopt a ''lifeboat ethic'' by denying food aid, even during crises, to countries with rapidly growing populations. 
 Those intellectuals didn't persuade Americans to adopt their policies, but they had more impact overseas. Under prodding from Westerners like Robert McNamara, the head of the World Bank, countries adopted ''fertility targets'' to achieve ''optimal'' population size. When an Indian government official proposed mandatory sterilization for men with three or more children, Paul Ehrlich criticized the United States for not rushing to help. 
 ''We should have volunteered logistic support in the form of helicopters, vehicles, and surgical instruments,'' he wrote, and added: ''Coercion? Perhaps, but coercion in a good cause.''
 India's enraged voters stopped the government from pursuing coercive policies, but the Chinese couldn't prevent their rulers from imposing a one-child-per-family rule. It was ostensibly voluntary, but the penalties were so severe that there were reported cases of forced abortions and infanticide. 
 Now China is facing a new problem: a severe shortage of young workers to support an aging population. The one-child rule turned out to be both an assault on personal liberty and a public-policy mistake. The parents made short-term sacrifices that left them worse off in the long run -- the same risk we run with policies designed to curb global warming many decades from now.
 Of course, the graphs projecting future temperatures could turn out to be more accurate than the old graphs forecasting food production and population growth. Global warming is a real danger, and in some ways controlling carbon dioxide is a more daunting problem than growing more food. It's worth paying for some insurance against drastic climate change. 
 But we need to balance uncertain future benefits against certain costs today. Most steps to combat global warming will be expensive and will slow economic growth, inevitably affecting poor people around the world. More of them will be sick, and more of their children will die. They'll be less educated and live in less technologically advanced societies.
 If the past is any guide, the chief plagues and disasters afflicting future generations will be different from the ones forecast by Al Gore or any other popular prophet. The best insurance policy is to build free, prosperous societies of smart, adaptable people. 
 In the long debate about overpopulation and famine, none of the gloomy projections by intellectuals proved to be as prescient as an old proverb in farming societies: ''Each extra mouth comes attached to two extra hands.'' No matter what problems lie ahead, the good news on Tuesday will be that America has 600 million hands to solve them.

HEADLINE: Conservative Credentials Of Governor Take a Hit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 13 

 BODY:
As he makes forays into Iowa and New Hampshire to generate interest in a possible run for president, Gov. George E. Pataki has taken pains to paint himself as a fiscal conservative, to court local conservatives and to urge Republicans across the nation to return to their conservative roots.
 But Mr. Pataki has long been viewed with suspicion in some conservative quarters. This week one of the most prominent conservatives to serve in his administration -- George J. Marlin, a former Conservative Party candidate for mayor of New York whom Mr. Pataki made executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- is releasing a book that seeks to cast further doubt on Mr. Pataki's conservative credentials. It is called ''Squandered Opportunities: New York's Pataki Years'' (St. Augustine's Press, 2006), and it paints a withering portrait of the governor. 
''New York conservatives must face the fact that Pataki betrayed the fiscal responsibility entrusted to him in 1994,'' Mr. Marlin writes in a chapter devoted to the large rise in state spending since Mr. Pataki took office in 1995. ''Except for his first three years in office, instead of championing conservative fiscal principles, his administration was dedicated to lavishly spending taxpayers' money to reward cronies, placate lobbyists and contractors, and neutralize municipal, healthcare and teachers' labor unions.''
 The Pataki administration minced no words in its reaction to the book. ''Mr. Marlin is nothing more than a disgruntled former employee who is making one last sad and pathetic attempt to make a couple of bucks off of his short and undistinguished tenure in public service,'' Michael Marr, a spokesman for the governor, said on Friday. 
 In 1997, when Mr. Marlin stepped down, Mr. Pataki said in a statement that ''his professionalism, foresight and courage will be hard to replace.''
 The book is the latest in a series of criticisms of Mr. Pataki from the right. 
 Rupert Murdoch, the press baron who is usually counted as a conservative, is quoted in The New Yorker this week complaining that Mr. Pataki, in order to get reelected, was ''prepared to do a deal with his natural enemies, particularly the big state unions who overstaff many state functions.''
 William F. Buckley Jr., an elder statesman of American conservatism, has called Mr. Pataki ''epicene,'' or sexless. And last year National Review ran Mr. Pataki on its cover with the headline ''Spurious George: The Pathetic Reign of New York's Governor Pataki.'' The magazine offered a biting conservative critique.
 The new book is taking a place on a shelf with two other recent books giving a gloomy assessment of New York State government. In ''Three Men in a Room'' (The New Press, 2006), former State Senator Seymour P. Lachman and Robert Polner, a journalist, write of the need to ''return democracy to the Empire State'' and give a dire assessment of the Legislature. In ''The Politics of Decline'' (Whitston Publishing, 2005), Jay Gallagher, the Albany bureau chief for Gannett News Service, charts what he calls New York's descent, focusing on the decline of the upstate economy and the troubled state government.
 Mr. Marlin, the author of ''Squandered Opportunities,'' is an unusual figure in New York's political firmament. He got his start in conservative politics at the age of 13, handing out fliers in Brooklyn and Queens for Mr. Buckley's conservative mayoral campaign. In 1993 he became the Conservative candidate for mayor himself. 
 He was tapped by Governor Pataki in 1995 to head the Port Authority, and spent a sometimes rocky two years there. Now he is a banker and an author who has edited the works of G. K. Chesterton and written histories of New York State's Conservative Party and of the Catholic vote in America. 
 In ''Squandered Opportunities,'' Mr. Marlin shies away from providing much of an insider account of the Pataki administration. Instead, he relies heavily on contemporary news accounts to give an overview of the Pataki years from his perspective as a conservative activist: from the hopes that were raised after Mr. Pataki defeated Mario M. Cuomo, the liberal icon, in 1994, to a feeling of betrayal as the governor tacked left.
 Mr. Pataki, of course, forged deals with unions and increased state spending in ways that helped him win re-election twice in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans five to three, and to win passage of programs by a Legislature that always wanted to spend even more. But he left some conservative supporters feeling betrayed.
 The book takes on a personal tone in places. In a chapter titled ''Patakiland: the Politics of Narcissism,'' Mr. Marlin writes of the governor's ''lax work habits'' and his ''detached approach to governing.'' And he notes that Mr. Pataki began to take on some of the characteristics of the man he unseated. ''Practices of Cuomo's that candidate Pataki criticized -- using state aircraft, appearing on state-financed television, and 'trading his office' by accepting outside speaking fees -- Governor Pataki embraced,'' he writes.
 But it is his portrayal of the governor's fiscal record that could prove the most damaging as Mr. Pataki proclaims his fiscal conservatism on the road. The book has a blow-by-blow retelling of 12 years of budget battles that saw the state budget balloon to roughly $115 billion this year from $62 billion back in 1995.
 On Friday, Governor Pataki canceled what would have been his ninth trip to Iowa since 2004 so that he could deal with the severe snowstorm in Buffalo. A Pataki spokeswoman told The Associated Press in Des Moines, ''He's got to be governor today.''

HEADLINE: Science Ignored, Again

 BODY:
The Bush administration loves to talk about the virtues of ''sound science,'' by which it usually means science that buttresses its own political agenda. But when some truly independent science comes along to threaten that agenda, the administration often ignores or minimizes it. The latest example involves the Environmental Protection Agency's decision to reject the recommendations of experts inside and outside the government who had urged a significant tightening of federal standards regulating the amount of soot in the air. 
 At issue were so-called fine particles, tiny specks of soot that are less than one-thirtieth the diameter of a human hair. They penetrate deep into the lungs and circulatory system and have been implicated in tens of thousands of deaths annually from both respiratory and coronary disease. The E.P.A., obliged under the Clean Air Act to set new exposure levels every five years, tightened the daily standard. But it left unchanged the annual standard, which affects chronic exposure and which the medical community regards as more important.
 In so doing, the agency rejected the recommendation of its own staff scientists and even that of its Clean Air Scientific Advisory Council, a 22-member group of outside experts that had recommended a significant tightening of the standards. Stephen Johnson, the agency administrator, claimed there was ''insufficient evidence'' linking health problems to long-term exposure. He added that ''wherever the science gave us a clear picture, we took clear action,'' noting also that ''there was not complete agreement on the standard.''
 One wonders how much evidence Mr. Johnson requires, and how ''complete'' an ''agreement'' must be before he takes action. A 20-2 vote in favor of stronger standards seems fairly convincing to us; likewise the unanimous plea for stronger standards from mainstream groups like the American Medical Association.
 The environmental and medical communities suspect that the administration's main motive was to save the power companies and other industrial sources of pollution about $1.9 billion in new investment that the more protective annual standard would have required. But here, too, the administration appears to have ignored expert advice. Last Friday, the agency released an economic analysis showing that in exchange for $1.9 billion in new costs, the stronger annual standards could save as many as 24,000 thousand lives and as much as $50 billion annually in health care and other costs to society. Studies like these always offer a range of possible outcomes, but even at the lower end -- 2,200 lives and $4.3 billion in money saved -- the cost-benefit ratios are very favorable. 
 In the next year or so, the administration must decide whether to tighten the standards for another pollutant, ground-level ozone, which causes smog and is also associated with respiratory diseases. The scientific advisory committee has tentatively recommended that the ozone standard be tightened, citing new evidence of smog's adverse effects. This time Mr. Johnson should pay more attention to the scientists and less to the political strategists in the White House.

HEADLINE: The Deathwatch for Cheap Oil

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN. 
E-mail: whatsonline@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THOSE falling prices at the gasoline pump may only be temporary. Indeed, they could signal the start of an era in which, forecasters say, ''the death of cheap, abundant crude might unleash war and plunge the world into a second Great Depression.''
 ''Peak oil is a reality,'' says Willem Kadijk, a hedge fund adviser quoted by Bloomberg Markets magazine. He is just one of many who believe that global oil production is now at or near its peak, and the only place to go is down. 
''Once the flow crests and starts to decline, and some geologists say it already has, oil will no longer be able to slake the world's growing thirst for energy,'' Deepak Gopinath writes in summarizing the argument. ''The result will be the oil shock to end all oil shocks.''
 The price of a barrel of crude oil, which closed yesterday at $58.68, ''will spiral to $200 -- and keep rising,'' he writes.
 Representative Roscoe G. Bartlett, a Maryland Republican, has formed the Congressional Peak Oil Caucus to draw attention to the issue. ''The world has never faced a problem like this,'' he told the magazine. 
 The nation's oil companies dispute the assertions. An Exxon Mobil spokesman says the company's geologists expect global oil production to keep rising for at least the next two decades.

ON SECOND THOUGHT -- If you think ethanol is a simple answer to solving our gasoline needs, think again, argues Consumer Reports in this month's cover article, ''The Ethanol Myth.''
 ''Despite the avid support of the Bush administration and major American car companies,'' E85 -- a commonly used blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline -- ''is unlikely to fill more than a small percentage of U.S. energy needs,'' the magazine says.
 Reasons for the pessimism are that ethanol costs more, is hard to find outside the Midwest -- only about 800 gas stations out of 176,000 nationwide sell E85 -- and provides fewer miles to the gallon. The magazine tested ethanol on a Chevrolet Tahoe and found that the fuel economy dropped ''27 percent when running on E85 compared with gasoline, from an already low 14 m.p.g.''
 At the time of the test, the average retail price of E85 was $2.91 a gallon, which meant the 27 percent fuel-economy penalty would have caused drivers to pay ''$3.99 for the energy equivalent of a gallon of gasoline.''

A FAR BIGGER BANG -- The Rolling Stones, fronted by their 63-year-old lead singer, Mick Jagger, are heading into the home stretch of what will be the most commercially successful rock tour of all time, Rolling Stone reports.
 By the time the tour ends in Hawaii next month, the band will have sold nearly two million tickets for a total of $256 million in revenue, according to the magazine, which cited figures compiled by Pollstar.
 The ''Bigger Bang'' tour, which began last year, set a record during its 2005 leg when it recorded $162 million in 43 dates, ''so this fall's tour could be considered a victory lap,'' Brian Hiatt writes.
 ''We're kind of looking at it like we're Lewis and Clark -- we're playing the Wyomings and Montanas,'' said Keith Richards, the guitarist.
 Michael Cohl, a promoter, said the tour could continue next year, although no dates are scheduled.
 In case you were wondering, U2's 2005 ''Vertigo'' tour is the second-highest-grossing tour ($138.9 million); the Stones own third place with the ''Voodoo Lounge'' tour in 1994 ($121.2 million); Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band grossed $115.9 million in their 2003 tour; and U2 rounds out the top five with $109.7 million in 2001 during its ''Elevation'' tour.

FINAL TAKE -- Even assuming that the growing number of companies devoted to space travel are successful, becoming a rocketman (or woman) is going to cost you at least $200,000. However, Popular Mechanics reports that for $295 ''you can launch a photo of yourself -- or some other keepsake -- into space on Bigelow Aerospace's Genesis II spacecraft, due to launch early next year.'' Not surprisingly, the company plans to sell space for corporate advertising as well. Can orbiting billboards be far behind? PAUL B. BROWN

HEADLINE: Another Record Week for the Dow

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average inched to another record close yesterday, giving it three consecutive weeks of triple-digit increases.
 The Dow spent much of a quiet session in the red after the strong surge Thursday in which it broke through 11,900 for the first time. Thursday's advance came amid optimism over the health of corporate earnings, and yesterday's gain put the Dow 12,000 benchmark within closer reach.
The average's gain yesterday was the Dow's sixth record close in two weeks. Still, stocks showed little overall movement as traders were unimpressed with a profit report from General Electric and brokerage firms issued negative comments about Home Depot. 
 Oil prices, which have supported stocks as they have fallen in recent weeks, moved higher, holding the major indexes to modest gains.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 12.81 points, or 0.11 percent, to 11,960.51, passing the record close of 11,947.70 set Thursday.
 Broader stock indicators also advanced. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 2.79 points, or 0.20 percent, at 1,365.62, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 11.11 points, or 0.47 percent, at 2,357.29.
 Bonds fell, with the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note down 7/32, at 100 19/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rising to 4.80 percent from 4.77 percent late Thursday. The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices fell.
 Crude oil settled up 82 cents at $58.68 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The markets were caught off guard yesterday by a 0.4 percent decline in retail sales last month. The decline, reported by the Commerce Department, was largely a result of a 9.3 percent decline in spending on gasoline. Spending did increase in other areas, however.
 ''I think this morning's retail sales figure was actually positive once you parse out all the details,'' said Mike Malone, a trading analyst at Cowen & Company, referring to a drop in spending on gasoline that enabled consumers to spend elsewhere. ''For all the talk of the death of the consumer, that is definitely not manifesting itself.''
 The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment figure for October was a stronger-than-expected 92.3. In September, the figure was 85.4.
 In corporate news, G.E. reported a 6 percent increase in its third-quarter profit, matching Wall Street's expectations, and turned in better-than-expected revenue. G.E., which was down 24 cents at $35.98, held back the S.& P. 500, which is weighted by market capitalization.
 Home Depot declined $1, or 2.64 percent, to $36.90 after several brokerage firms issued negative comments on the company, the nation's largest home improvement chain. Home Depot, one of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow, announced plans on Thursday to shake up its executive structure to try to improve performance.
 The furniture maker La-Z-Boy fell $1.14, or 7.6 percent, to $13.86, after the company lowered its quarterly earnings and sales forecasts for all three of its divisions, citing a weak retail environment.
 Viewpoint, which provides Web search and advertising services, was down 26 cents, or 25.5 percent, at 76 cents a share after cutting its full-year revenue forecast amid soft ad spending and customers' product delays.
 FMS Financial rose $4.85, or 18.1 percent, to $31.60 after Beneficial Mutual Bancorp agreed to purchase the company, the parent of Farmers and Mechanics Bank, for $28 a share, or about $183.2 million in cash and stock.

HEADLINE: 300 Million of Us, and Counting

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 One hundred million people ago, when the population was 200 million, a commission proposed by President Nixon in 1969 (inspired by Daniel Patrick Moynihan) reached a very different assessment of our population numbers than the unalloyed enthusiasm of your Oct. 11 editorial ''300 Million.''
The Commission on Population Growth and the American Future enacted by Congress consisted of 24 members appointed by the White House. John D. Rockefeller 3rd was the chairman. It met for two years (1970-72) to evaluate the pros and cons of future growth of America's population, based on five volumes of research commissioned by the panel. I was its executive director. 
 The main focus of its report was the implications of continued growth for the economy, the environment, for governance and various social concerns. High levels of unwanted births (still estimated today at 14 percent of all births) and illegal immigration (trivial by today's numbers), which it opposed, were two of its concerns. Its main conclusion was that the stabilization of population would be advantageous on every count. 
 The image that 35 years later we would be celebrating 300 million, let alone the 400 million expected in a few more decades, was never on the drawing board. 

Charles F. Westoff
Princeton, N.J., Oct. 11, 2006

To the Editor:
 Dismissing current concerns about America's rapid population growth chiefly as fears of right-wing xenophobes and alarmists ignores polling data indicating that a majority of Americans, faced with increasingly crowded cities, suburban sprawl, mounting traffic jams and growing environmental concerns, do not want further population growth. 
 While the United States benefits in certain respects from immigration and population growth, and as the United States population would still be growing even if immigration were significantly reduced, the benefits of immigration must be weighed against these concerns, which are shared by Americans of many political views and backgrounds.

Christopher S. Edwards
New York, Oct. 12, 2006

To the Editor:
 I agree wholeheartedly with your editorial criticizing Patrick Buchanan's fear-mongering regarding immigration. But your statement that ''our population issues have mysterious ways of working themselves out'' is a dangerous oversimplification.
 It can't be denied that many of the predictions of the 1968 book ''The Population Bomb'' have been disproved with the passage of time. Its author, Paul R. Ehrlich, certainly didn't foresee surprising developments like declining populations in some technologically advanced nations. 
 But it is also true that most of the serious problems facing humankind are exacerbated or directly caused by exponential population growth. These range from dire environmental degradation to increased human misery from causes such as severe water shortages and, yes, famine.
 Immigration into the United States is a social issue that is best viewed from the perspective of the history of this nation. Global population growth, however, is taking us into distinctly uncharted territory. It is certainly premature to assume that things will ''work themselves out.''

Larry Geni
Evanston, Ill., Oct. 11, 2006

To the Editor:
 Beyond whatever celebrations may accompany the United States' population hitting 300 million, there are some facts worth pondering about this accidental milestone.
 Fully 35 percent of all United States births are unplanned. We still have the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the developed world. And we have laws that promote abstinence-only programs that masquerade as sex education and allow pharmacists in some states to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions.
 Maybe we should stow our party hats and put on our thinking caps instead to start planning for a less crowded future.

John Seager
Washington, Oct. 12, 2006

The writer is president of Population Connection (formerly Zero Population Growth).

To the Editor:
 Your editorial celebrating the 300 millionth American could not be more shortsighted. ''The Population Bomb'' may now be found in garage sales, but its basic premise is as valid today as it was in 1968: environmental impact = population x consumption x technology. This equation demonstrates the simple fact that each American will have far more impact on the world and its resources than will, say, the average Ethiopian. 
 Population growth exacerbates all the problems associated with global warming. I'm afraid we will need to find something other than our ''teeming immensity'' to keep us from growing ''stale.''

HEADLINE: Behind Enemy Reactors

BYLINE: By Jon B. Wolfsthal. 
Jon B. Wolfsthal, who monitored North Korea's nuclear program for the United States, is a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
I CELEBRATED New Year's in 1996 by drinking cheap sparkling wine at the Yongbyon nuclear center, where North Korea produced the plutonium for its first nuclear test. Like dozens of dedicated civil servants, I served as an ''on-site monitor'' under the 1994 United States-North Korean nuclear agreement known as the Agreed Framework. 
 Those of us who served as monitors are proud of what we accomplished. I am not alone in being concerned that many commentators and government officials are trying to lay the blame for at least some of the current nuclear crisis at the feet of the previous administration's efforts to end North Korea's nuclear program. These allegations have little bearing on the facts and minimize the contribution of the Americans who served their country in dangerous circumstances. 
In 1994, the situation with North Korea had become so fraught that the Clinton administration was considering military strikes to prevent North Korea from extracting plutonium from spent nuclear fuel at Yongbyon. At the time, North Korea might have had enough plutonium, produced in 1989, to build one or two nuclear devices. The fuel being discharged contained enough plutonium for five to six additional weapons. 
 Last-ditch talks between former President Jimmy Carter and President Kim Il-sung of North Korea defused the crisis and led to the framework. The deal, which helped us avoid a military conflict that could have destroyed Seoul, froze Pyongyang's plutonium program; eventually, it could have led to North Korea abandoning its nuclear efforts in exchange for diplomatic recognition by the United States and economic incentives. 
 In 2002, however, American intelligence agencies confirmed that North Korea was trying to acquire a uranium enrichment program in violation of the deal. But instead of working within the framework to get North Korea to abandon its nuclear efforts, the Bush administration terminated the agreement altogether. It also began arguing for regime change.
 In jettisoning the framework, the administration jettisoned something of great diplomatic value. A key part of the agreement was the willingness of North Korea to let Americans -- with whom they were legally at war -- into their nuclear center to secure plutonium-bearing fuel rods for internationally monitored storage. In other words, the framework put Americans behind enemy lines.
 As you might imagine, the daily circumstances were nothing short of insane. Assigned to North Korea for a month or so at a time, we were put up in a hastily constructed cement ''guest house'' a half-mile from the most secret nuclear site in North Korea. The 10 people on each rotation were watched by armed guards; our rooms were monitored at all times. No phone calls home or outside communication was possible. When I was there in the winter of 1996, temperatures at night hit 30 below. To get to work every day, we would pass through no fewer than four police and military checkpoints, some with machine-gun nests. The site itself was highly unsafe and radioactive and would have been shut down by safety officials in seconds had it operated in the United States. 
 Those who took the assignment left families and friends behind and bounced between acute stress and extreme boredom. Some read to escape the monotony, some played cards. I ''borrowed'' an International Atomic Energy Agency VCR to watch movies. We all knew that at any moment, should the political winds change, we would be hostages deep in hostile territory with no American embassy to protect us. But we took the job to make our country more secure and to pursue an end to North Korea's nuclear program. 
 Now that North Korea claims to have tested a nuclear device, administration supporters and commentators are seeking to blame the framework for all our problems. 
 They should look elsewhere. Without the framework's freeze, North Korea would have immediately acquired enough plutonium to produce more nuclear weapons and would have completed construction of two much larger weapon production reactors. By now, North Korea would have been capable of producing 20 nuclear weapons per year. 
 The prolonged freeze on North Korea's production and nuclear construction delayed the acquisition of nuclear materials -- and it appears to have prevented North Korea from completing the larger reactors. The testing of a nuclear device by Pyongyang was pushed back at least a decade.
 Those of us who served in North Korea risked our personal safety and comfort for our country. We protected America from danger and our efforts delayed the onset of the nuclear crisis we now face. To argue otherwise is to play politics with history.

PERSON: ELIZABETH MAY 

HEADLINE: An Accidental Canadian Finds Her Environmental Footing

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA 

 BODY:
ONE afternoon 33 years ago, Elizabeth May was picked up outside her dorm at Smith College for what she thought was a weeklong study break. She never returned.
 Once in her parents' car, Ms. May learned that the family's home, a farm outside Hartford, Conn., was up for sale. Her father had quit his job as an insurance executive and all of them, including her younger brother, were headed to a new life in Cape Breton, the picturesque but economically deprived island in Nova Scotia.
For Ms. May, her parents' impulsive move soon meant trading a life of relative affluence for periods of near poverty. Undergraduate life at Smith was exchanged for years of waiting tables and cooking in a restaurant. And instead of her parents' circle of politically active friends, including George McGovern and a young Bill Clinton, there were villagers who were suspicious of, and sometimes unfriendly toward, all who were, as they put it, ''from away.''
 That situation, however, gave Ms. May a perspective that was critical in her development into one of Canada's most prominent environmentalists. After founding the Sierra Club of Canada and running it for almost 17 years, Ms. May has emerged as the leader of the Green Party of Canada, an also-ran in Canadian politics but a group with a platform nonetheless. 
 Under Canadian election law, the 5 percent of votes the party won in the past two national elections entitles it to about 1 million Canadian dollars a year, or about $800,000, in government campaign financing. And in Ms. May, the party -- which has yet to send a single member to Parliament -- has its first leader who is a well-known figure.
 Ms. May's switch from environmentalism to politics was prompted, she says, by the election of a minority Conservative government under Prime Minister Stephen Harper in January. ''I was going through a nail-biting, wrist-slashing phase of my life known as watching Harper get to victory,'' she said.
 Perhaps the most surprising factor in Ms. May's ascent is that she has overcome misgivings about her American upbringing, though she did become a Canadian citizen. Many Canadians, particularly voters on the left, are mistrustful of politicians who have simply lived in the United States, not to speak of being born there.
 Yet, the chaos that Cape Breton brought to her life has helped her bridge many of the subtle, if significant, gaps between Canadians and Americans. ''I'm lucky that I didn't go to Toronto, where I then immediately joined an environmental group,'' she said. ''I wouldn't have developed that strong sense you need to find the differences in a culture that aren't immediately apparent.''
 Canadians, Ms. May said, are more cautious and deferential to authority than are Americans. And brash appeals simply do not work here.
 ''In the United States, I can say: 'I've got a check here, who's going to match it,' '' Ms. May said of her money-raising efforts. ''If you do that in Canada, it's a terrible social faux pas. People look at their shoes.''
 Ms. May's introduction to fund-raising and campaigning came early. Her mother, Stephanie May, was a founder of the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, and that took Elizabeth to Washington for a news conference when she was still a toddler.
 ''My mother represented motherhood, I represented the contaminated innocent,'' Ms. May said. ''I sat on Hubert Humphrey's lap for a good chunk of the press conference.''
 Stephanie May's political work expanded to include fund-raising for several Democratic campaigns, including the presidential bids of Eugene McCarthy and Mr. McGovern. Mr. Clinton, Mr. McGovern's Connecticut organizer, became a regular houseguest and remains a family friend. 
 THOSE campaign efforts ultimately produced disappointment, culminating in the re-election of Richard Nixon in 1972. That and the general disruption of the era gradually soured the Mays on the United States. In the fall of 1973, they decided to abandon the country for a 100-acre farm with two dilapidated houses that Stephanie May had purchased on a whim while vacationing in Cape Breton the previous summer.
 To support the family, or so they thought, they bought a long-closed restaurant along the Cabot Trail, Cape Breton's scenic highway, that was housed in a permanently moored sailing schooner built in 1918. Attached was a gift shop.
 Within a year, the money-gobbling Schooner Village transformed the family into what Ms. May called ''nouveau pauvre,'' as they slept in the gift shop's storeroom over the winter because they could not afford to heat their house as well. Instead of finishing her college degree, Ms. May took correspondence courses in restaurant and kitchen management.
 When not cooking, waiting tables or begging neighbors for vegetables that missed a supplier's weekly shipment, Ms. May found time for environmental work. Gradually she become noticed, not just in Cape Breton but nationally, for organizing a campaign against aerial spraying by the pulp and paper industry, which spread a toxic cloud over the entire island. 
 It was a difficult crusade. The closing of coal mines and the decline of fishing had brought unofficial unemployment levels in Cape Breton to over 30 percent. For many people, work meant cutting spruce trees or leaving the island. But the province eventually banned all aerial spraying of insecticides. 
 With credit for her work experience, Ms. May was admitted to law school in Halifax without even an undergraduate degree, and won scholarships that paid her living expenses and tuition.
 After practicing advocacy law for a while, she accepted a post in 1986 as special adviser to the environment minister in the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney.
 But that ended two years later, when the government allowed a province to build two dams in Saskatchewan without an environmental assessment, and Ms. May quit in protest. A court later found that the government had acted improperly, though the dams were ultimately built. 
 IN 1989, she started the Sierra Club of Canada and, as in Cape Breton, took on unpopular causes -- in particular, Alberta's oil sands or, as she prefers, ''tar sands.'' While they are a source of wealth for Western Canada and oil for the United States, they require tremendous quantities of natural gas in the extraction process -- a huge contribution to the greenhouse gases that are widely believed to be contributing to global warming.
 ''So we've got a huge amount of energy being consumed in order to produce the oil, which we then sell to the United States for cars that don't have proper energy efficiency standards,'' she said. ''This is an appalling megaproject.''
 While calling for a moratorium on new oil-sands developments, she is also focusing on ending subsidies to the industry. ''Fix the tax system, stop subsidizing the most profitable companies in the world to produce the world's most profitable product,'' she said. ''Should be simple.''
 On a recent afternoon, Ms. May was wearing a green and yellow Green Party pin (which actually bears a resemblance to the logo of the oil giant BP) as well as the tiny white, enameled medallion of an officer of the Order of Canada, one of the country's top civilian honors.
 ''Canada's a wonderful country,'' she said. ''If you beat up on the government for 30 years, you can still get the Order of Canada.''

HEADLINE: Is Chivalry Shivved?

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Hillary Clinton became a senator because men abused her. Her husband humiliated her in public and her opponent, Rick Lazio, hounded her in a debate. She was a sympathetic figure to many voters only after she went from pushy to pushed around.
 So John McCain must be wary as he figures out how to push her around. He must slide in the shiv chivalrously. 
 This week, he managed to attack her three ways in one sentence: as a senator, as a wife and as a future opponent. This raises the question: Is it a smart move, pleasing a base that cringes at stories of these celebrity senators palling around, knocking back drinks on an overseas trip? Or is it a misstep, making Mr. McCain look like a sexist bully for pointedly blaming his fellow senator for her husband's old policies -- and calling her ''Mrs. Clinton'' just to rub it in?
 On a trip to Detroit to campaign for a Republican Senate candidate, Mr. McCain singled out Hillary for a shellacking on North Korea. ''I would remind Senator Clinton and other Democrats critical of Bush administration policies that the framework agreement her husband's administration negotiated was a failure,'' he said.
 The next morning on CBS's ''The Early Show,'' he was asked why he would blame the Clintons for North Korea's batty behavior.
 It's clear, after all, that the North Koreans are acting immaturely in response to W. acting immaturely. They want attention because the Bush administration inexplicably refuses to talk to them. And they know, in the pre-emptive world ordained by nutty Dick Cheney, that the best way to protect themselves from the fate of Saddam Hussein is to actually go nuclear, rather than merely fantasizing and boasting about it.
 But the Republicans love to blame Bill Clinton for everything, from the radioactive Congressional page explosion to the radioactive North Korean explosion.
 Mr. McCain told Hannah Storm that he ''was responding to attacks made on President Bush by Mrs. Clinton, Senator Kerry, Senator Reid and other Democrats.'' Hillary advisers noted that she was called ''Mrs.'' while the others were called ''Senator.''
 Just as the male Republican front-runner, known for a short fuse, must be careful how he attacks the female Democratic front-runner, the former first lady must be careful how she attacks the war hero.
 If she doesn't respond forcefully, she's not fit for the alpha chair in the Oval; if she responds too forcefully, the Republicans will try to paint her as an angry harridan who would nag us to death, or go all hypersensitive on us.
 ''It hurts her when she gets in a defensive crouch on her husband's record,'' a McCain adviser said.
 Clearly, the missus does not think so. Billary has their 2008 war room running and finger-wagging. Just as they teamed up recently to punch back when Condi and Bush boosters accused Bill of being lax with Al Qaeda before 9/11, Hillary swiftly rebutted the charge that Bill was lax with North Korea, calling it ''ridiculous.''
 Privately, Hillary's camp was not overly upset by the McCain swipe because it suspected he was doing the bidding of the White House and that he ended up, as one adviser put it, ''looking similar to the way he did on those captive tapes from Hanoi, where he recited the names of his crew mates.'' Besides, Senator Clinton does like to cruise on her husband's coattails and remind Americans that the economy was exploding and the world wasn't.
 Hillary's people think she's better off tying herself to les bon-temps-roulez Bill years than Mr. McCain is tying himself to the war-without-end W. years. ''It's bad enough that he strapped himself to a broken Acme rocket on Iraq and the economy, now he's strapping himself on North Korea,'' said one. ''People were enamored of his independence, but now he just seems like Bush's windup toy, the obedient corporal.''
 Linking to W. may become even more problematic if Republicans lose the House next month, and Democrats begin a lollapalooza of investigations into W.'s economic policies, Katrina management methods, Iraq military plan and Iraq reconstruction record.
 But Hillary and her first lad have their work cut out for them in trying to take out a popular war hero, according to Mark Halperin and John Harris, authors of ''The Way to Win: Taking the White House in 2008.''
 ''Our sense right now,'' Mr. Halperin says, ''is that McCain would beat any Democrat including Hillary Clinton, and Clinton would beat any Republican except for McCain.''

HEADLINE: Champion Boxer and Builder Aim to Help Latinos

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 13 

 BODY:
Oscar de la Hoya and John Long are unlikely business partners: one a championship boxer who is the son of Mexican immigrants, the other a successful but relatively obscure real estate mogul who came to the United States from China as a boy. 
 But the muscular fighter and the slightly built property investor both grew up in working-class neighborhoods in Los Angeles, and that common bond brought them together. In 2005, they formed Golden Boy Partners with a shared $100 million investment and a mission, Mr. de la Hoya said, to ''revitalize Latino neighborhoods by building nice homes that are affordable for people who work in the area, teachers, nurses, fire and police.''
Indeed, judging from the experience of others, investment in urban areas instead of upscale suburbs is not only profitable but a new fashion in enterprise for prominent athletes. These days, they are not just lending their names but forming true partnerships to capitalize on often overlooked projects. 
 Earvin (Magic) Johnson, the basketball star, has been a pioneer in inner-city business for more than a decade, with stakes in movie theaters, coffee shops and restaurants, a mortgage company and Canyon-Johnson Urban Funds, a real estate venture. ''Redeveloping these urban neighborhoods provides business opportunities and jobs,'' he has said. His company recently turned an old Chicago police headquarters into condominiums and retail units in the heart of the city.
 Active athletes are getting into the game. Keyshawn Capital Development, a venture of Carolina Panthers wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, is a partner with the developer Chris Hammond in two shopping center projects in South Los Angeles. And Shaquille O'Neal of the Miami Heat has formed a real estate company to participate in a huge development of 1,100 housing units in downtown Miami. 
 A shift in emphasis has occurred over time from viewing inner cities and minorities who live there as candidates for public assistance to seeing potential for investment and entrepreneurship. The Milken Institute, in Santa Monica, Calif., has been studying what it calls ''emerging domestic markets'' for a decade and its researchers have found that minority businesses (Latino and Asian predominantly) ''are growing even faster than the population in terms of new companies and revenues.'' 
 Of those businesses, real estate is attracting more capital because in urban neighborhoods today ''it is a real business with real returns,'' said Betsy Zeidman, director of the Center for Emerging Domestic Markets at the Milken Institute. 
 Among the largest companies currently engaged in inner city home building is CityView, a firm organized by Henry Cisneros, who was secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Clinton administration and mayor of San Antonio before that. CityView is working with a $500 million revolving fund from the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the country's largest public pension fund, and it has built 4,000 homes in California and major cities across the nation, including Chicago, Detroit and Denver.
 Mr. Cisneros's company reports annual returns on investment of 20 percent and more for the pension fund. 
 CityView gears the cost of its houses to a price that equals one and a half times the median income for the local community, Mr. Cisneros explained. ''I call it work force housing,'' he said, ''because it is meant for the moderate-income working people that are the heart of every community.''
 ''But that is also its strength,'' he said, ''because there is always an active market for such housing while luxury housing is subject to boom and bust with the rise and fall of the economy.''
 And beyond those considerations, Mr. Cisneros looks at a more important underpinning for urban housing markets: population growth. The United States population is projected by census experts to grow by 36 percent in the next four decades to 410 million, from 300 million today. And growth among urban ''minorities'' will be faster than average -- including, Mr. Cisneros said, ''a rise of 63 million in the Latino population.''
 Mr. de la Hoya, 33, a nine-time world boxing champion in six weight classes, grew up in East Los Angeles in a neighborhood he describes as ''nice enough, although nobody owned their own home -- everybody rented.'' Two decades ago, mortgages were hard to find in low-income neighborhoods. 
 But times are changing because of the growth of the Latino community in the Los Angeles area, and the increasing attention from investors and bankers wanting to serve the so-called minority majority, the largest single ethnic group in kaleidoscopic Southern California. 
 Mr. de la Hoya, nicknamed the Golden Boy, is notably unmarked for someone who has fought 265 amateur and professional bouts -- and knocked out more than 170 opponents. He is more than a sports idol in Los Angeles. A successful investor in business and real estate, he owns the downtown Los Angeles building that houses Golden Boy Promotions, his boxing-match promotion company, and Golden Boy Enterprises, through which he has invested in eight Spanish-language newspapers among other ventures. The value of his businesses so far, including the building, is about $70 million, according to estimates by real estate and sports analysts.
 Mr. Long amassed his fortune from commercial real estate. When he came to the United States from China in 1954, Asian people still could not legally own property in California; the state Legislature repealed the Alien Land Law two years later. Mr. Long, then 7, was of a merchant family that owned grocery stores in old Canton, now Guangzhou. But the Communist government took over the stores after coming to power, so the family moved to America.
 Mr. Long grew up in a poor neighborhood in South Los Angeles, but went on to study economics at U.C.L.A. and then earn a master of business administration degree at Harvard Business School. ''I didn't know what I really wanted to do, but coming from my background I wanted to be in business of some sort,'' Mr. Long said. 
 The business he chose was real estate.
 In 1971, he went to work for Kaufman & Broad, a home builder (now KB Homes) and in 1978, he formed his own company, Highridge Partners, with four associates and began investing in commercial real estate. His strategy was to carefully select properties he deemed undervalued. ''We wanted to be owners,'' Mr. Long recalled. ''We would identify assets, negotiate a purchase, lease it out, develop it from soup to nuts and sell it.'' 
 Property ownership has been profitable. For over 28 years, he and his associates have owned more than $6 billion worth of real estate in California and Texas and say they have multiplied their initial investment more than 1,000 times. 
 And now, Mr. Long, whom business acquaintances cite as ''a really tough negotiator,'' is making a new kind of selection. He is investing in urban real estate, specifically in growing Latino communities. His Highridge group has sold most of its properties to focus on Golden Boy Partners. ''In this partnership,'' Mr. Long said, ''we are creating an investment vision in Latino society.'' 
 Golden Boy Partners has six projects in various stages of preparation and is closest to breaking ground to build 107 town houses on the site of a shuttered beer distribution warehouse in South Gate, an industrial city of about 100,000, 12 miles from downtown Los Angeles. The town houses will be sold at up to $400,000 apiece, which might seem high any place but the Los Angeles area.
 ''Homes across the street from the site sell for $500,000,'' said Mr. de la Hoya, interviewed along with Mr. Long at his suite of offices and conference rooms in downtown Los Angeles, decorated partly in mahogany paneling and partly in posters for boxing matches.
 Golden Boy Partners will provide assistance by introducing buyers to mortgage lenders but the business will be done at market rates, Mr. de la Hoya said. ''We have talked to all the mortgage companies and they are eager.'' 
 The emphasis on market rates is characteristic of these ventures in urban real estate, which both men describe as part business, part philanthropy -- profit-making but purposeful. ''Obviously, you go into business to make money but at the same time we want to help families,'' Mr. de la Hoya said.
 ''What Oscar is saying,'' Mr. Long chimed in, ''is we are making profit and also taking into account the needs of the people and the community.''
 Mr. de la Hoya's stature guarantees respectful attention from city councils and permitting boards in Southern California's welter of medium-size cities. And with $100 million in initial equity, Golden Boy Partners can borrow four times that, providing up to $500 million to invest. The company is also looking into building major retail operations in Huntington Park, a city of 65,000 in Los Angeles County that is already a beehive of small shops catering to Latino families. 
 Mr. Long is not only investing in urban development but has also created a center for real estate -- what he calls ''this $20 trillion industry'' -- at U.C.L.A. It is a center intended to look ahead. ''The choice of the next generation will be urban,'' Mr. Long said. ''They won't want to commute. We need to study real estate in relation to the environment and to the legal system and to the choices people will have to make.''
 Underlining the point, Mr. de la Hoya said, ''Young people getting married in the Latino culture want to live near family.'' In addition to his business activities, Mr. de la Hoya, who won a bout in Las Vegas in May, insists he is not retired but could fight again in 2007. That would require two months seclusion for rigorous training, he said, which would take him away from business and from yet another activity he has begun -- writing a book. ''I want to write about the contribution of Latinos to the future of America,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Investors Catch the Consumer Itch to Buy 

BYLINE: By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
SIGNS that the economy is continuing to grow -- even amid what the Federal Reserve said was ''widespread cooling'' in the housing market -- buoyed stock prices and lifted the Dow Jones industrial average to a record close just shy of 12,000. It closed yesterday at 11,960.51. 
 Robust corporate earnings, led this week by McDonald's and PepsiCo, fed optimism about consumers' determination to spend regardless of traditional economic indicators that suggest they would usually tighten their belts. 
Not even the forced departure of several high-profile chief executives was enough to damp investors' enthusiasm.

TURMOIL IN TOULOUSE -- Just three months after he took control of Airbus, the world's largest commercial airplane maker, Christian Streiff, quit amid a bitter clash with other executives over how to reorganize the company, which has been plagued by manufacturing chaos and delays in its new superjumbo airliner, the A380.
 Louis Gallois, a co-chief executive of the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, Airbus's corporate parent, succeeded Mr. Streiff. Thomas Enders, EADS's other co-chief and Mr. Streiff's primary opponent, was relieved of direct supervision of Airbus.
 Airbus, which is based in Toulouse, France, has overtaken Boeing as the world's biggest commercial aircraft maker in recent years but has stumbled badly of late. Costly production delays in the A380 project will sap its profitability, and regular customers have been unenthusiastic about the smaller A350, which was supposed to compete with Boeing's popular 777 Dreamliner.
 Mr. Gallois will take on the job of cutting 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) a year in costs. That will include job cuts, the company said, even as it denied a report in La Tribune, the financial newspaper, that as many as 10,000 jobs are at risk.

SCANDAL SPREADS -- Three more companies said senior executives had stepped down amid a stock option scandal that has so far involved more than 100 companies. The controversy revolves around accounting discrepancies that might have inflated the value of executives' stock options and cost shareholders hundreds of millions of dollars.
 McAfee, the maker of antivirus software, fired its president, Kevin Weiss, and said its chief executive, George Samenuk, had retired. CNet Networks, an online media company, said that Shelby W. Bonnie, a co-founder, had resigned as chairman and chief executive. The Boston Communications Group, a telecommunications company, said E. Y. Snowden had resigned as its chief executive.
 The options investigations have focused on backdating, in which companies base their executives' options on the company's stock price right before a big rise rather than on the stock price the day the options were awarded. The effect is to inflate the value of the options for executives who sell them later at a higher price. 
 Backdating can significantly affect companies. McAfee said it might have to restate as many as 10 years of financial records and take a charge of $100 million to $150 million because of the accounting problem.
 Apple Computer said Fred D. Anderson would resign from its board because of option grant backdating when he was Apple's finance chief. Two former executives of Brocade Communications face criminal charges related to backdating.

BIG DEAL -- In the latest and one of the largest management-led leveraged buyout deals, Charles F. Dolan, the 79-year-old founder of Cablevision Systems, and his son, James L. Dolan, the chief executive, offered $19.2 billion to buy out public shareholders.
 The offer came a year and a half after an independent committee of the company's directors rejected a plan by the Dolans to break the company in two, keeping the lucrative cable systems and spinning off the rest of the company's assets, including Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, the New York Knicks and the New York Rangers.
 Last month, Cablevision suffered its own stock option embarrassment when it had to acknowledge it had granted stock options to a vice chairman after he had died while making it appear as if they were granted when he was still alive.
 A new special committee of independent directors is expected to be impaneled to review the bid, and may ask the family to pay more.

A BOOM'S ECHO -- In a deal that harks back to the dot-com boom of the 1990's, the Web search company Google agreed to buy YouTube, a 19-month-old company that has scant revenue and has never made a profit, for $1.65 billion in stock.
 Nearly every big media and technology company had courted YouTube, a Web site where the young people coveted by advertisers watch as many as 100 million short videos every day. Google is expected to use its advertising skills to match those viewers with companies eager to sell them products and services. 
 Google, which has a market value of $132 billion, did not say how it decided what to pay for YouTube.
 Analysts said Google must hurry to deal with the millions of copyrighted clips that YouTube's users have sent to the site. They could invite copyright-infringement lawsuits against the deep-pocketed Google.

CHIEF ABDICATES -- Ending a yearlong battle with some of his biggest investors, Jay S. Sidhu quit as president and chief executive of Sovereign Bancorp, the company he built from a small savings and loan into a regional powerhouse with 800 branches and $89 billion in assets.
 The company, based in Philadelphia, said Mr. Sidhu, 55, was retiring for family health reasons. He is entitled to $13 million in severance pay, according to public documents.
 He has been under fire since he agreed last October to sell 19.8 percent of Sovereign to a Spanish bank for $2.4 billion. Investors said the deal was aimed at avoiding a 20 percent threshold that would have required shareholder approval. The Spanish bank, Banco Santander Central Hispano of Madrid, has since increased its stake to 24.9 percent.
 With Mr. Sidhu leaving, analysts said that Sovereign, which operates from Maryland to New Hampshire, was vulnerable to being taken over, probably by Santander.

HEADLINE: After Years of Growth, What About Workers' Share?

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
JOB growth is starting to slow, and wages are barely keeping up with inflation. Five years into a relatively robust economic expansion, it's understandable that many American workers feel that they are not getting their fair share of the pie. 
 In fact, the share of the economy devoted to workers' wages and benefits has eroded in the United States over the last five years. But if it's any consolation, the trend for workers in other rich industrial nations isn't much better. 
The portion of the economy going to the workers in wages and benefits is perhaps the broadest measure of the workers' share of economic growth. The numbers are based on how many workers are employed and how much they are paid for their toil. 
 In the United States, this economic slice, including wages, health insurance and pension benefits, declined 2.5 percentage points from 2000 to 2005, to 56.5 percent of gross domestic product, according to the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis. 
 Workers in some countries have lost even more. According to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the forum of industrialized countries, the workers' share of gross domestic product in Germany fell 3.1 percentage points over the last half-decade. In Japan, the decline was 3 points. 
 Over all, the workers' share of the economy fell in 4 of the Group of 7 industrialized nations.
 The recent declines are hardly atypical. While there have been some periods when the workers' share has risen, the overall trend since the 1970's has been downward in most industrialized countries. 
 Economists have identified some important forces causing this erosion, but they are mostly perplexed by the long decline. ''It's a bit of a mystery why the labor share is falling so much,'' said Alan B. Krueger, a professor of economics at Princeton.
 Olivier Blanchard, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, added, ''The complete, integrated story remains to be told.'' 
 For workers, perhaps the most important question is, how long will the slide continue?
 Workers in the United States appeared to get a break for a few years in the second half of the 1990's, when robust growth bolstered employment and increased labor's bargaining power. Workers' share of the economy grew 2.3 percentage points from 1995 to 2000.
 But that increase proved fleeting. While the uptick led some economists to expect a similar rebound in this decade, many are losing hope.
 ''The longer the recovery is delayed,'' Mr. Krueger said, ''the less confident I am.'' 
 To begin with, consider changes in the composition of the American economy. In 1975, manufacturing accounted for 28 percent of output, while finance accounted for 18 percent, according to an analysis by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. By 1995, the relative importance of these sectors had flipped -- with finance accounting for 27 percent and manufacturing for 22 percent.
 This shift took a chunk out of the workers' share because banks and other financial companies use fewer workers than manufacturers to do what they do, and they don't pay their workers proportionally more. 
 And well-known forces continue to whittle away at the workers' share. Cheap imports from China and cheap call centers in India have increased the competition for jobs. New technologies have also replaced many middle-income workers. And immigration is on the rise in much of the industrial world.
 Though economists do not fully understand how these forces are affecting labor markets, most seem to agree that, one way or another, they are eating into the workers' share of the pie.
 In the United States, where labor unions have lost much of their bargaining power and few workplace regulations limit employers' decisions, companies have had an easier time reducing real wages. In the last year, wages have risen only enough to keep pace with inflation. In real terms, the wages of nonmanagement employees in the United States are now 10 percent below their level in the early 1970's, according to Labor Department statistics. 
 In Western Europe, collective bargaining has been more successful in keeping wages up. These differences affect the distribution of the workers' share. America's low-wage labor market is virtually nonexistent in the European Union. There is no Western European equivalent of the American earning $5.15 an hour, the federal minimum wage, on the overnight shift as a convenience store cashier. A $7-an-hour baby-sitter is nearly impossible to find in London. Over all, the wage distribution in Europe is much less polarized than it is in the United States.
 BUT the institutional differences have done little to halt the slide in the share of the economy that is devoted to workers' compensation.
 Mr. Blanchard suggested that the decline in the labor share in Europe might have been prompted in the 1970's by strong unions pushing up employee wages -- which led companies to shed workers, eliminating many occupations entirely -- the late-night cashier, for example -- and replacing others with machines. 
 ''The decline in the wage share is bound to level off,'' said David Grubb, a labor economist at the O.E.C.D. But the question is, when will it stop falling, and how?
 If historical experience in the United States serves as any guide, workers' compensation could still fall a long way. It was a different world then, but it is worth noting that in 1929, workers had less than half of the economic pie.

HEADLINE: An Arm in the Air For That Cab Ride Home

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
LAST weekend, I did a remarkable thing. I hailed a cab.
 It was late, around 2 a.m. and I had just finished dinner with friends in SoHo. I was alone, and raised my hand, looking for an available yellow cab. As if by magic, one drove by, stopped and I stepped in.
That may not sound like anything extraordinary, but it was the first time I can remember getting a cab to carry me uptown that late at night without having to hide in the shadows while white friends procured one for me.
 In fact, after living overseas for nearly a decade, I have noticed that in New York, it is much easier for me -- a black male in my 40's -- to get a cab. 
 The change has led me to ask two questions. First, how did this come about? After all, empty cabs zipping by my outstretched arm seemed like a fact of life -- a persistent form of discrimination, seemingly impossible to end.
 And second, how come progress didn't come sooner? How could such an obvious form of discrimination -- akin to not serving blacks at lunch counters -- continue all these years?
 While I know the problem isn't gone -- more than a few taxis still regularly pass me by -- my black friends and colleagues also say they have had less trouble getting a taxi today than they had just 5 or 10 years ago (although many are reluctant to admit it, because of the lingering anger and anxiety they suffer from past taxi encounters). 
 Now, my friends and I look more mature than we did 10 years ago and, if I dare say, we dress better, which may account for our newfound taxi-hailing success.
 But numbers make me think that something else may be going on. The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission's ''Operation Refusal'' program, in which undercover officers of different races randomly hail taxis, found in its most recent study a 96 percent compliance rate among cabbies. The commission says the compliance rate has grown consistently since the program was instituted in 1997, when it was 88 percent.
 ''It's a better climate today for everybody in the city to catch a taxi than it was back then, no matter what your race,'' said Matthew W. Daus, the city's taxi commissioner. ''Drivers realize that the person they refuse to pick up could be an undercover officer and that has reduced the temptation to discriminate.''
 Taxi officials and academics who have studied this issue attribute the more favorable climate to three factors: security, economics and enforcement. Taxi drivers have less fear of blacks than they did 10 or 20 years ago, especially since New York is a much safer city today and attacks on taxi drivers have declined. In fact, the last cabby homicide in New York was nearly a decade ago, in 1997.
 During the crime wave of the late 1980's, whenever a taxi driver would pick me up, I would often ask why. One driver told me that he stopped because I was wearing a suit and because he looked into my eyes and didn't see any evidence that I used crack cocaine.
 Another explained why he often refused black customers by showing me a scar across his neck, the result of brutal robbery by a black male customer. 
 ''You must understand that I really don't hate black people,'' he said. ''It's just I have to choose which is worse, a fine or death.''
 And truth be told, in my experience, most of the drivers who refused to pick me up or take me to my destination during that time were of African descent.
 Ian Ayres, a Yale Law School professor, says economics may play a role in the discrimination. In a study of the taxi industry in New Haven, Conn., Professor Ayres found that 40 percent of blacks left no tip, compared with 10 percent of whites.
 ''If in fact there has been a decline in difficulty for blacks hailing a cab in New York, it could be based on an actual increase in tipping patterns or a perceived one,'' Professor Ayers said. 
 He added that cabbies make quick economic judgments by appearances. ''If you're a cabdriver and you're pulling up to the curb, you get only one look at the customer and you can't ask them for their resume or where they live,'' he said. ''The decision to pick up a passenger is often tied directly to economics based often on how someone is dressed.''
 But perhaps the biggest factor is enforcement. At the Hess gas station at 45th Street and 10th Avenue, a popular place to refuel, many cabbies said they were less likely to discriminate because of stepped up enforcement by the taxi commission, after the actor Danny Glover complained that five taxis had refused to stop for him because he is black.
 ''I know two drivers who lost their licenses because they chose a white passenger over a black one,'' said a cabby who gave his name only as Arif. ''But I told them they were stupid because the black peoples make good money, too.''
 Mr. Glover's celebrity focused national attention on the problem in a way that hadn't been done before. In the 1980's, I recall filing at least five complaints against taxi drivers who refused to stop for me. It was, for me, a way of dealing with the helplessness and humiliation I felt. 
 I remember telling one cabby, who ordered me out of his cab after I asked to go to Harlem, that I would have my revenge in taxi court, and I did. He was fined $250.
 I often encourage my black friends to file complaints when they are refused taxi service. But few do, arguing a complaint will not make much difference. 
 It's not uncommon. Officials at the Taxi and Limousine Commission said that while there has been a record number of complaints this year for a variety of reasons -- poor service, filthy cabs, refusals, reckless driving -- few riders see the cases through to resolution. 
 Which makes me believe that, yes, times are better -- and no one appreciates it more than me -- but I also know that inevitably, one cold night in SoHo, I will once again stand on a street corner, arm out, and watch cab after cab rush by. I'll probably be frustrated, outraged and perhaps very sad. 
 If I can, I'll file a complaint. And if I'm in a generous mood, maybe I'll remember that progress comes steadily, if too slowly.

HEADLINE: Corporate America's Pay Pal

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON; Eric Dash contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
YOU may not know Frederic W. Cook, but if you are a shareholder or employee who has watched executive pay rocket in recent years, you are likely to be acquainted with his work.
 As the nation's leading executive compensation consultant, Mr. Cook and his colleagues at Frederic W. Cook & Company are probably responsible for creating more wealth for executives over the last 20 years than any other pay advisers.
He and his associates have advised on the $1.1 billion option grant that Computer Associates gave its top three executives in 1998 and the $83 million pension benefit amassed by Hank McKinnell, Pfizer's recently ousted chief executive. And in 2000, court documents show, Mr. Cook's firm provided advice to Tyco International's compensation committee, which heaped a $95 million pay package on L. Dennis Kozlowski, its chief executive at the time. 
 Mr. Cook also invented ''reload stock options,'' the financial equivalent of perpetual-motion machines, which helped bestow millions of lucrative shares on executives over more than a decade until an accounting change forced them into disfavor. This year, officials at the Business Roundtable, a corporate lobbying organization, hired Mr. Cook to counter critics of executive pay; his study tried to justify rapid increases in the packages. 
 The soft-spoken Mr. Cook, 65, does not see himself as corporate America's Pied Piper of pay. Instead, he asserts, he is just a ''foot soldier'' in the army of capitalism. But in any study of executive compensation practices over the last 25 years, the contributions of this foot soldier are more akin to those of a field marshal.
 ''Fred Cook is the dean of compensation consultants,'' said Broc Romanek, a former S.E.C. lawyer and editor of CompensationStandards.com, an educational service that provides guidance on pay issues.
 An examination of Mr. Cook's career, clients and counseling neatly parallels the explosive growth in executive compensation packages, offering a window onto the mechanics and machinations behind the growing windfalls. From 1970 to 2000, according to a Harvard study, the median compensation awarded to the three highest-paid officers at major American corporations rose to $4.6 million from $850,000. More recently, that figure has settled down to around $4.35 million. 
 Concerns about shareholder value, corporate governance and the economic and social impact of soaring C.E.O. pay has led to mounting criticism of compensation practices across the nation. Warren E. Buffett, in his annual report to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders this year, decried the role that consulting firms play in awarding lofty compensation packages that have little to do with how well a company performs. Mr. Buffett's generic name for these accommodating firms is ''Ratchet, Ratchet & Bingo.'' 
 Since its founding in 1973, Mr. Cook's firm has served more than 1,800 clients, including more than half the world's 250 largest corporations. The firm, privately held, employs 50 people; it is based in New York and has offices in Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and London. Cook & Company engineered compensation innovations that other consultants and corporations have emulated, innovations all made palatable by an argument that Mr. Cook propagated to justify this huge transfer of wealth to chief executives: that newfangled pay packages aligned the interests of shareholders and management.
 IN corporate boardrooms across America, Cook & Company is renowned and relied upon when pay is in play. When the board of Empire HealthChoice Inc., a nonprofit insurer in New York, set out to increase its executive pay to reflect private-sector practices, it called on Mr. Cook. According to a 2002 examination of the company's pay practices by the New York State Insurance Department, the nonprofit's directors selected Mr. Cook ''in an effort to be creative when considering total compensation.'' After HealthChoice hired Mr. Cook's firm, the insurer's pay packages increased significantly; the insurance department's report questioned assumptions that Mr. Cook's study used to recommend pay raises at the insurer.
 Creativity where executive pay is concerned is something in which Mr. Cook takes great pride. On many occasions -- at conferences and before Congress -- he has identified himself and his firm as ''the thought leader'' on matters involving executive compensation. Although Mr. Cook declined to be interviewed for this article, previous interviews with him, a review of his speeches, writings posted on his firm's Web site and discussions with industry peers displays his singular influence on the development of executive pay practices.
 In declining to be interviewed, Mr. Cook said that he could not comment on specific clients that he and his firm have worked with, because of confidentiality policies. But amid concerns about escalating compensation packages, some of those who advise corporations on pay say consultants like Mr. Cook can do more than simply engineer or rubber-stamp outsized salaries and stock options. 
 ''It's not so much that the consultant facilitates, but that the consultant doesn't apply the brakes,'' said Brian Foley, head of an independent consulting firm in White Plains. ''You have to read clients the riot act from time to time -- you have to be willing to walk away to the point of being fired.''
 It is entirely possible that in recent years Mr. Cook and his colleagues have tried to brake the runaway pay train at some or all of the companies they advise. 
 On Thursday, Mr. Cook addressed 2,000 compensation professionals at a conference in Las Vegas. Mr. Cook told the gathering that he tried to advise companies to do the right thing on pay but was sometimes rebuffed. He cited two occasions when he encouraged clients to rein in exorbitant executive retirement plans but lost the argument. Asked if he ever thought about walking away from clients with whom he disagreed, he said, ''It wasn't a quitting issue.''
 Even so, Mr. Cook's willingness to attach his formidable name to the Business Roundtable's study exonerating corporate compensation practices suggests that he is friend, not foe, to executives on the receiving end of lottery-sized payouts. 
 While reasonable people continue to argue both sides of the executive pay question -- some say pay is exorbitant, others say it is justified -- few dispute that consulting firms like Mr. Cook's have given corporations the fuel they needed to put compensation growth on the fast track. 
 Compensation consulting firms range from smallish, independent shops like Cook & Company to huge conglomerates like Hewitt Associates and Towers Perrin that house sizable pay-advisory subsidiaries. Although nearly 50 compensation consultancies operate nationwide, up from just a handful 20 years ago, they have been largely hidden from investors' view because publicly traded companies have not had to identify them in their pay disclosure filings. That is about to change: the Securities and Exchange Commission has instituted new rules that will require companies to identify their compensation consultants in public filings next year.
 The business is very profitable, but analysts say that large firms often use pay consulting as a loss leader so they can snare more lucrative consulting contracts. Any consultant that pushes back on executive pay packages runs the risk of putting other consulting contracts at risk.
 A spokeswoman for Hewitt Associates said it had strict policies in place to ensure the independence and objectivity of all its consultants, including those working on executive compensation.
 A Towers Perrin spokesman said the firm ''rigorously applies policies, safeguards and controls to ensure that the objectivity of our professional advice to clients on executive compensation matters is not compromised by any other consulting assignments we undertake for our clients.''
 In that context, some consultants say, the new S.E.C. disclosure rules would have been more robust if, in addition to mandating disclosure of the consulting firm's identity, they also required a rundown of other services a firm provides to each of its clients. But they do not. Pressure to do more business with a compensation client, some consultants say, has given advisers an incentive to push the boundaries of executive pay practices.
 Consultants and the companies often justify pay packages by relying on comprehensive surveys of compensation practices among peer companies. It is out of these studies that the famous percentiles emerge that keep pay rising. Companies report their executives' pay as landing in a particular percentile of their peer group -- the 75th is common -- to make it seem reasonable.
 BUT the data set that these surveys use can be skewed to include, for example, large, one-time stock option grants given to corporate executives for a specific reason -- to reward a promotion, for example, or to induce a top manager to join the company. Though these awards are unusual, they are included in surveys, driving up the pay of every executive who used them. 
 The bull market in stocks that began in 1982 and ran with some stumbles through the 1990's also gave consultants an opportunity to juice their clients' take by showing them that total compensation across corporate America was rising. Mr. Cook pointed this out in a speech last year. Because option grants were valued at the price of the underlying stock when awarded, he said, in periods of rising share prices, consultants could use the fact that total compensation from options was rising in their studies. For companies whose stock prices lagged behind the market or their peers, consultants recommended increasing the size of the option grants, to remain competitive. 
 ''All the benchmarking data everyone is using has been inflated over the past 15 years so most of that data is useless,'' Mr. Romanek said. ''Everybody should start fresh.''
 It is easy to see why compensation consultants are so popular -- and powerful -- with top executives today. But that was not the case when Mr. Cook started out. At the time, compensation consulting was usually a small subsidiary at firms like McKinsey & Company and Booz Allen Hamilton, and actuarial firms like Towers Perrin.
 After graduating from Dartmouth, Mr. Cook spent four years as an infantry officer in the Marine Corps. He began his career at Towers Perrin in 1966, according to a 2001 profile of Mr. Cook in Workspan magazine, a publication for compensation and benefits professionals. 
 Mr. Cook struck out on his own in 1973, when he was 32 and, according to the magazine profile, he felt that he had little to lose. He cashed in $25,000 in a profit-sharing account he had at Towers Perrin and rented office space in the Murray Hill neighborhood of Manhattan. Cook & Company's headquarters are still there. 
 Mr. Cook set himself apart early on, by bringing a keen interest in accounting to executive pay issues. Many companies were concerned about making awards that might prompt tax problems, so a consultant with accounting expertise was in demand. Compensation, meanwhile, was becoming more complex.
 According to ''Board Perspectives: Building Value Through Compensation,'' a book by Paul Hodgson, an expert on compensation issues, stock options were popular throughout the 1960's, before federal legislation in 1969 reduced their tax advantages. Then the bear market struck and millions of options were underwater. Other long-term incentives replaced options, and cash bonuses became more popular throughout the 1970's. 
 During these years, few corporate boards had compensation committees. That changed in the 1980's, when executive pay began to climb at a faster pace. In 1984, the Internal Revenue Service moved to limit the payment of large severance packages known as ''golden parachutes.'' Two years later, when the capital gains tax rate rose to 28 percent, cash and option gains found themselves on equal footing as far as taxes were concerned. 
 Enter Mr. Cook. In 1988, he came up with a new type of stock option -- the reload -- that put him and his firm on the map. Mr. Cook became the ambassador of reloads, selling them to corporate clients interested in pleasing executives. As he explained them, reload stock options were ''enhancements'' that allowed executives to increase their stock ownership, aligning their interests with those of shareholders. 
 IN reality, reloads were awards that were automatically replaced each time they were exercised. For example, if an executive received a grant of 1,000 options carrying a strike price of $10 a share, and later exercised them for $20 a share, he or she instantly got 1,000 more options with a new strike price of $20. Some reloads even had a special feature that covered the tax bills generated by option exercises. In these cases, the replacement option covered a larger number of shares than the original award to pay for taxes due, further diluting the equity stakes of existing shareholders. 
 Mr. Cook designed the first reload stock option plan for executives at the Norwest Corporation, a Minneapolis bank holding company. The plans soon spread through corporate America like wildfire. In a 1998 analysis of reloads, Mr. Cook noted one reason for their increased popularity. ''As executives who have experienced the opportunities of reloads move to other companies or join boards of directors,'' he wrote, ''they are likely to influence the spread of reloads as a tool to obtain the benefits it provides.'' 
 By 2001, reloads had become so popular that Mr. Cook told clients that about one in five of the largest United States companies were using them. About half that many were using tax reloads, he said. In 1997, for example, Sanford I. Weill received 20 different option grants, all with reload features, worth an estimated $142 million. Reloads contributed to an estimated $1 billion received by Mr. Weill over 17 years at the head of Citigroup and some of its predecessor companies. Through a spokesman, he declined to comment.
 Some analysts eventually blamed reloads for an enormous and, some said, stealth transfer of wealth from shareholders to managers. James F. Reda, an independent pay consultant in New York, was among the first to raise a red flag. In a 1999 article in the Journal of Compensation and Benefits, he and Thomas Hemmer, now a professor at the London School of Economics, concluded that reloads were bad for shareholders and that limits should be placed on their use.
 ''I have a lot of respect for the technical aspects of reloads, but I didn't like that they weren't in the best interests of shareholders,'' Mr. Reda said. ''I was always surprised about how many board members thought it was in the shareholders' interests. I never could figure out how.''
 Reloads fell out of favor three years ago after accounting changes made them less attractive. But Mr. Cook has found other ways to keep compensation aloft, and his firm's work on pay packages for executives at Computer Associates and Pfizer ended up angering some shareholders at both companies.
 Cook & Company advised Computer Associates on a pay plan that in 1998 produced a $1.1 billion stock award for Charles B. Wang, its chief executive; Sanjay Kumar, its president at the time; and Russell M. Artzt, an executive vice president. The award was a result of an employee stock ownership plan approved by shareholders in 1995. Under the plan, the three men stood to share as many as six million options if the company's stock traded above certain preset levels on at least 30 trading days over the following five years. Mr. Wang was to receive 60 percent of the grant; Mr. Kumar, 30 percent; and Mr. Artzt, 10 percent. 
 Computer Associates' compensation committee told its shareholders that the plan would ''promote the creation of stockholder value by encouraging, recognizing and rewarding sustained outstanding individual performance by certain key employees who are largely responsible for the management, growth and protection of the business.'' The committee also said the plan would help shareholders by retaining key individuals.
 The plan generated its first big payment to the executives in 1998. Mr. Wang received shares worth $670 million while Mr. Kumar got shares worth $335 million. Mr. Artzt got a grant worth $112 million. All three executives later returned 22 percent of the shares to settle a stockholder suit.
 The company declined to comment beyond saying that the plan was no longer in place.
 High-level executives at Computer Associates, now known as CA, were later found to have artificially inflated sales figures in 1999 and 2000. Mr. Kumar pleaded guilty earlier this year to eight counts of fraud and obstruction in the case. Neither Mr. Wang nor Mr. Artzt was named in the case, and Mr. Artzt remains with the company.
 Mr. Cook's firm also guided Pfizer on the pension plan that awarded $83 million to Mr. McKinnell. When the company disclosed the value of the plan, shareholders were outraged because their stockholdings had fallen by 50 percent on Mr. McKinnell's watch. The pension became the source of picketing and angry questions at the company's annual meeting in April.
 Mr. McKinnell's pension grew so large because it contained a highly unusual element, a Pfizer spokesman explained at the time. While most pension benefits are figured by using a multiple of an executive's salary and bonus, the pension calculation for Mr. McKinnell included the value of Pfizer shares he had received under long-term incentive arrangements from 1993 to 2001. In 2000, Pfizer's compensation committee decided to discontinue that unusual inclusion. 
 As for the Cook firm's work for Tyco, which related to stock options, a spokeswoman for Tyco declined to comment. 
 Last year, Mr. Kozlowski was found guilty of looting the company and covertly selling shares while artificially inflating company results.
 OF course, it is possible that Mr. Cook and his colleagues have tried to reduce the size of their clients' pay packages over the years and have been overruled by them. Consultants are, after all, just advisers. They cannot force clients to follow their advice. 
 But in testimony before Congress last year on the subject of executive compensation, Mr. Cook argued that a bill to try to rein in pay -- the Protection Against Executive Compensation Abuse Act -- was undesirable. Mr. Cook used most of his testimony to criticize news-media reports on executive pay. ''The media has been flooded with a multitude of distorted, misleading and oftentimes erroneous statistics chosen to portray U.S. C.E.O.'s and board governance in a negative light,'' he said. 
 At an executive pay conference last year, attendees were buzzing after James Dimon, the chief executive of J. P. Morgan Chase, delivered his keynote speech. Mr. Dimon took pay consultants to task in his talk, decrying, among other things, the use of peer-group surveys to ''ratchet things up.'' 
 With Mr. Cook in the audience, Mr. Dimon also described the corporate deployment of stock options as ''very capricious'' and said that when he arrived in 2000 as Bank One's new chief executive, he immediately cut back on pay items and perquisites -- supplemental retirement plans, company cars and club memberships -- awarded to top executives. It was too much, he said, because well-compensated professionals should be able to pay their own club dues and car bills. And he eliminated supplemental retirement plans at Bank One.
 Who designed the plans that Mr. Dimon so happily and proudly scrapped? Cook & Company.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Oct. 15 about Frederic W. Cook, an executive compensation consultant, gave an outdated educational affiliation for Thomas Hemmer, who has done research on reload options, a form of stock options developed by Mr. Cook. Mr. Hemmer is an accounting professor at the University of Houston; he left the London School of Economics in August 2005. Mr. Hemmer pointed out the error in an e-mail on Dec. 8.

HEADLINE: That Still Was the Week That Was

BYLINE: By NOAH ROBISCHON

 BODY:
IT'S 7:35 on a recent Friday night, less than four hours until VH1's ''Best Week Ever'' goes on the air, and the producers need to cut two minutes from their tightly packed half-hour of pop-cultural snarkiness. These are the tough choices: snip the MySpace video of Sean Combs, a k a Diddy, urinating, or lose a film clip of Tucker Carlson on ''Dancing with the Stars''?
 As the editor trims, the writers begin riffing on tainted spinach. The news of a death related to the E. coli outbreak was still too sensitive to be turned into compost by the show's panelists, a rotating troupe of around 15 comedians who put their spin on celebrity foibles and other news reports. But all that could change in a week.
''The media has a reaction cycle to things like that,'' Fred Graver, the show's executive producer, said. ''You can see it coming.'' 
 Predicting the coming week's water-cooler chitchat has been essential to the success of ''Best Week Ever,'' now in its fourth season. The show's irreverent humor has attracted a devoted following, persuading VH1 executives to gamble on producing more weekly series instead of concentrating on long-form specials. And the show's Web blog, podcast and online video clips are praised by programming executives at VH1's parent company, Viacom, as a model of how to spin off digital content related to a series.
 Not bad for a series that started as an inside joke.
 Back in 2002 VH1 was still feeling tipsy from the popularity of the ''I Love the '' franchise, a series of hourlong mash notes to the last three decades of American music, movies, television, fashion and politics. Having rerun ''I Love the 80's,'' and then the 70's and the 90's, into oblivion, the obvious question was: What's next? During a meeting with the channel's executives, Mr. Graver said, ''We should do 'I Love Last Week' -- you know, nostalgia for the very short attention span.'' 
 Six weeks later, during a Fourth of July news void, a pilot was tested before an audience. Mr. Graver, who spent six years writing for David Letterman, figured that if ''Best Week Ever'' worked during a holiday week in the middle of summer, then the rest of the year would be a cinch. 
 ''It was one of our best-testing shows ever,'' said Michael Hirschorn, VH1's executive vice president for original programming and production. ''Everybody got it.'' 
 ''Best Week Ever'' is easy to grasp in part because its format is inspired by print magazines, a reflection of the backgrounds of Mr. Hirschorn, a former editor of Spin, and Mr. Graver, who edited National Lampoon, as well as Web blogs. ''That blogger mentality was something that I really wanted to capture,'' Mr. Graver said. 
 The show's site (bwe.tv) accelerates the snarkiness cycle to an even more dizzying pace. One regular feature compiles the best moments from the previous night's TV shows into a five-minute video titled ''Best Night Ever.'' The site attracts around a quarter of a million unique visitors each week, said Brian Graden, the president of entertainment at MTV Networks Music Group. (By comparison, the gossip blog Jossip receives about the same number of visitors each week, while Gawker exceeds that number daily.) 
 Some of the video clips produced by the show have become online hits, like a parody of the Mac vs. PC commercials that were then incorporated into the week's television broadcast. And the comedians who appear on air are often hosts of the podcasts, which have been downloaded at least five million times. 
 Nobody has figured out exactly how to capitalize financially on this success, but that is beside the point, Mr. Graden said. ''Our philosophy is you just have to deal with where the audience is going and figure out how to make money later,'' he said.
 Essentially ''Best Week Ever'' crams a couple of dozen news topics, or ''news-driblets'' as the writers call them, into each 21-minute episode. A clip of LonelyGirl15's Web hoax is thrown into a tease before the commercial break, for example, or a throw-away line from ''CBS Evening News With Katie Couric'' -- she said, ''True that, peeps'' -- is used as the punch line for the opening barrage of video clips. 
 Even the narration that takes viewers from one package to the next becomes microsegments: ''While you were celebrating 'Star Trek's' 40th anniversary -- you know who you are,'' the show's announcer says over images from a Trekkie convention, ''we were finding the week's best moments in case you missed it.''
 ''In Case You Missed It'' is one of the show's regular features, a roundup of four or five video snippets found on TV or online. There is also a gossip-sheet mash-up known as ''The Sizzler.'' And one celebrity, or an inanimate object, is always crowned as having the ''Best Week Ever'' before each show's end. About the only subject not addressed is politics, which is the biggest differentiator between ''Best Week Ever'' and other news-based comedies, including the 1960's satirical series ''That Was The Week That Was,'' which Mr. Graver studied while creating this series. 
 The comedians who pop up throughout lovingly embrace and then demolish one topic after another. Most of them improvise commentary during the studio taping. The ones who manage to carve out a distinctive voice become regulars: Christian Finnegan is the smart aleck; Sherrod Small is the droll hipster; Melissa Rauch plays the hot chick who talks like a truck driver.
 The joined-at-the-hip duo known as Frangelina, Frances Callier and Angela V. Shelton, are the resident social commentators on subjects like Scientology's silent birthing rites. The pair have written a book and an animated series, and have appeared on the comedy series ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' and ''Grounded for Life.'' But ''Best Week Ever'' has ''done more for our career than any single other job,'' Ms. Shelton said, even though all of their appearances on the show during the last season add up to less than 15 minutes of airtime. Fox is now filming a pilot based on their buddy act. 
 Lately the panelists have taken part in skits, like the phony courtroom arguments of ''Paul F. Tompkins Celebrity Defender.'' These personality sketches will expand in the current season, but the production values will always remain closer to cable access than prime time, said Jim Ackerman, VH1's senior vice president of development. The cheesy backdrops were ''a byproduct of economics,'' he said, ''and now it is something that we embrace.''
 Diddy, Paris and Britney have all been edited to within an inch of their lives by 8:20, and the staff settles in to watch the 101st episode one more time. Mr. Graver trots out a makeshift bar and mixes everyone an ''office-tini,'' a weekly ritual inspired by the cocktail cart that once rolled the halls of Time magazine. The show includes 16 commentators, two celebrity D.U.I. arrests and a bleeped-out sex joke that was nearly pulled by the lawyers who preview the show every Friday during lunch. 
 The writers and producers eventually figure out a way to work in the tainted spinach scare too. After scanning dozens of morning shows for reaction to the outbreak, a trend emerged: ''The one thing everyone kept mentioning was that, 'Oh, you could put arugula in there,' '' Mr. Graver said. And so, at the end of the following week's episode, the ''Best Week Ever'' was awarded to arugula.

HEADLINE: Buy-Write Funds: A Blast From the Industry's Past

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
INVESTMENT vogues seldom die. They just hibernate until market conditions change and investors are ready for them again.
 Consider mutual funds using ''covered-call'' strategies, which involve the sale of call options on stocks held in a portfolio. About two decades ago, a clutch of these funds appeared, pitching themselves to income-hungry investors. But most of them soon disappeared as their performance flagged.
Lately, though, funds based on covered-call strategies have re-emerged like cicadas, creating a stir after a long slumber. Now they are generally called ''buy write'' funds and sold as closed-end rather than open-end mutual funds; 21 of them have popped up in the last two years, according to Lipper, the fund tracker. 
 Bill Sickles, a senior research analyst at Lipper, says investment firms hope the funds' combination of equity exposure and current income may entice aging baby boomers. ''There's a big marketing push on,'' he said. 
 A covered-call fund sells options to generate cash and thus guarantees itself a modest return from them, but, in doing so, it also limits its possibility of big gains. (The option buyers, for their part, get the right to ''call away'' the fund's shares if they hit or exceed agreed-upon prices. That lets these buyers speculate on the possibility of stocks rising without having to shell out the full price of the shares.) Fund shareholders must still bear the risk of losing money from large stock-market losses.
 When the market treads water, ''people look for added returns,'' Mr. Sickles said. ''Covered-call funds can give you a little additional return in a sideways market.'' 
 Wall Street, never shy when it comes to promoting new strategies or repackaging old ones, has helped with that search, introducing a variety of tweaks to the basic covered-call approach. Merrill Lynch underwrote more of the new funds than any other firm, raking in tens of millions in fees, which were pulled out of the offering proceeds, as is typical. Eaton Vance, based in Boston, has rolled out five covered-call funds in the last two years, while BlackRock in New York has floated two and recently acquired two more when it merged with Merrill's asset management division. 
 At Eaton Vance, the Tax-Managed Buy-Write Income fund aims to beat the total return of the Standard & Poor's 500, while its Tax-Managed Buy-Write Opportunities fund splits its money, aiming to beat the S.& P. with one pool and the Nasdaq 100 with the other. The BlackRock World Investment Trust, by contrast, roams the world and can invest as much as 25 percent of its money in debt.
 ''We take an active approach on the options side, '' said Kyle G. McClements, BlackRock's head of equity derivative strategies. ''That's a little different than most of what the competition has done. They'll do a stock index and sell index options. With our legacy BlackRock funds, we do actively managed portfolios and sell single stock options.''
 Covered-call funds aren't just marketing razzle-dazzle. They can have a legitimate, if limited, place in many portfolios, Mr. Sickles said. What's more, conservative investors have long sold call options on individual stocks in their portfolios as a way to generate income while waiting to sell the shares. 
 ''If you're an equity investor and you're willing to take the volatility of full equity exposure, this isn't for you,'' said Ronald M. Egalka, an options specialist who advises the five Eaton Vance buy-write funds and is chief executive of Rampart Investment Management in Boston. ''Anytime you do anything that hedges and the asset moves up dramatically, you're going to have an opportunity cost. That's the risk in the strategy.''
 (Opportunity cost, an economics term, equates to the anguish of wondering, ''What if I'd kept those Google shares?'')
 A 2004 study by Ibbotson Associates in Chicago found that, for 16 years starting in the late 1980's, a covered-call portfolio would have slightly beaten the S.& P. 500, while its returns would have zigzagged less. Ibbotson's report gave the strategy a boost, as did the creation in 2002 of a covered-call index by the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The index, called the BuyWrite Benchmark Index, tracks the performance of a passive investment in the S.& P. 500 paired with a monthly sale of an S.& P. 500 index call option. The ''buy write'' name is shorthand for the approach: an investor buys stocks and then writes call options on them. 
 The covered-call strategy has plenty of detractors. Even one fan points out that the sorts of returns documented by Ibbotson could disappear as more investors piled on. Robert E. Whaley, a professor at the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt, helped the Chicago Board create its index. In a 2002 study, he showed that from 1988 to 2001, the strategy would have had about the same return as the S.& P. 500 but only two-thirds the risk. Ibbotson built on his work by stretching the time frame.
 While doing his research, Professor Whaley discovered that index options sold for more than financial theory says they should. Heavy demand by institutional investors for options pushes up their value, and that premium plumps the return of the covered-call strategy. 
 But as new funds crowd into the market, they may gobble up the premium, Professor Whaley said. ''What you have is all these funds jumping in and systematically selling calls, and maybe that will bring the prices back into alignment,'' he explained. ''That could destroy the strategy, though that hasn't happened yet.''
 Faced with these findings, Alan Marcus, a finance professor at Boston College, remains skeptical of the covered-call approach. He faults what he calls ''the peculiar and not particularly attractive risk profile.'' 
 He zeroes in on these funds' willingness to sacrifice big gains. Sure, they collect income from the options they sell, and that helps cushion them when stocks stagnate or fall modestly, he said, but they are still exposed to big drops in stock prices. ''This isn't the way that most people would choose to hedge -- that is, keeping all the risk of a downturn while getting rid of all the opportunity of a major market upside,'' he said.
 Any complex strategy -- and writing options is knottier than, say, buying and holding the S.& P. index -- imposes additional costs that eat into an investor's return. The covered-call funds tracked by Lipper have an average expense ratio of 1.3 percent, whereas the ratio at big index funds typically is much lower: 0.18 percent at Vanguard's 500 Index stock fund, for example, and 0.2 percent at its Total Bond Market Index fund. 
 Another potential difficulty of the current covered-call funds is that they typically operate with a closed-end structure. In a closed-end fund, an underwriter sells all the fund's shares at once; then they trade just as stocks do. Sometimes, the shares trade at a discount, that is, for less than the value of the fund's investments, and other times at a premium. As a result, investors must determine not only whether a fund fits their needs and risk tolerance, but also whether its shares are cheap or expensive compared with the value of the fund's investments. Lipper has cautioned against buying closed-end funds at their initial public offerings, finding that, on average, their value typically falls in their early months because of start-up and sales fees. 
 Many fund managers like the closed-end setup because it frees them from wrestling with daily inflows and outflows of money caused by the customer purchases and withdrawals common inopen-end funds. That lets them focus on picking investments. 
 ''We felt that if you were dealing with inflows and outflows of money, it'd be a disruption of not only the portfolio and but also adverse to the operations of the fund,'' said Walter A. Row III, director of equity research at Eaton Vance. ''When you're thinking about options, you're talking about a fast-moving market, and you want to deploy a reasonable trading strategy.'' 
 PROFESSOR MARCUS recalls that in the 1980's, after the earlier covered-call vogue subsided, brokers pitched another strategy: the sale of deep out-of-the-money put options. Puts require sellers to buy shares at an agreed-upon price. If the stock falls to or below that price, the option buyer can ''put'' his stock onto the seller.
 ''You had all of these brokers telling people to write these out-of-the-money put options because there was supposedly no way the market would go down more than 15 percent in a single day,'' he recalled. ''Many small investors were wiped out by these sorts of positions in the 1987 crash.'' 
 Granted, investing directly in options differs from buying shares in a covered-call fund. But Professor Marcus still wonders whether covered-call funds might lead unsophisticated investors to speculate inadvertently on the options market, when they'd be better off investing in straight stock and bond index funds.

HEADLINE: How High a Gasoline Tax?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Raise the Gasoline Tax? Funny, It Doesn't Sound Republican'' (Economic View, Oct. 8): 
 An increase in the gasoline tax would be in America's best geopolitical interests, as it would break dependence on oil supplied by unstable countries.
 If we can figure out a subsidy program for the poor, who need inexpensive gasoline to get to work and make a living, I would be all in favor of a reasonable increase in the tax. It would help us along the way toward energy independence and a cleaner environment.

Steven M. Clayton
Ocean, N.J., Oct. 8

To the Editor:
 Don't tax the gas; tax the gas guzzlers. Raising general gasoline taxes hurts the poor. If expense will reduce use, taxing the vehicles that use the most gas will be just as effective as raising the gas tax. 
 Everyone who owns a car chooses what kind to buy.

Allison Tupper
Manhattan, Oct. 9

To the Editor:
 There is another way to attack the problem of our nation's overuse of Middle East oil: lower and enforce the speed limit on highways. 
 Lately, by limiting my own highway speed to 60 miles an hour, I have achieved a 15 percent increase in fuel efficiency. 
 Lowering highway speeds would be an excellent way for Americans to reduce fuel consumption and to make a small sacrifice in the war on terror.

HEADLINE: Uneasy Street

BYLINE: By MARK CALDWELL. 
Mark Caldwell is the author of ''New York Night: The Mystique and Its History.''

 BODY:
ON a wintry morning, with commuter traffic racing down the street, a wall of steel shutters glaring at the deserted sidewalks and litter whipping in the wind, Fordham Road can seem as bleak as the Cross Bronx Expressway in a snow squall.
 But on a warm summer or early fall afternoon, the street is alive with shoulder-to-shoulder pedestrians and a noisy traffic jam of young men in monster S.U.V.'s. Store signs are huge, flashy, fluorescent-lighted plastic panels. Music pounds from storefronts, and street criers push through the crowd, shouting about cellphone deals. Occasionally, a three-card monte game sets up, vanishing as soon as a police officer appears.
A food market spills citrus aromas onto the sidewalk. Clerks and customers haggle, shuffling the fruit around like shell-game operators. In high summer, a row of vegetable men sets up south of Fordham Road, selling Scotch Bonnet peppers more incendiary than anything Whole Foods has to offer, at a fraction of the price, willing to bargain over that, and imparting cooking advice besides. 
 From the Jerome Avenue el station down the half-mile-long hill that descends to Webster Avenue, Fordham Road is a broad boulevard, offering a vista so spacious it doesn't quite look like New York. Yet according to Wilma Alonso, executive director of the Fordham Road Business Improvement District, it's too crowded to be anywhere else. 
 In a single hour on Wednesday, Sept. 27, between 5 and 6 p.m., the Fordham BID clocked 2,088 people passing the northeast corner of Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse. Except perhaps for Times Square and Canal Street, few Manhattan streetscapes can rival the crowds there. 
 ''A year ago, people told me business wasn't good,'' said Daniel Bernstein, deputy director of the BID. ''But now, I think we're having a big boom here.'' He cited both a falling vacancy rate and a recent spate of store openings.
 Major crime in the precinct that claims the Fordham Road shopping strip is down 74 percent since 1993. Over the last few years, an assortment of big-box chains -- the Gap, Staples, P. C. Richard & Son, even a Bally fitness center -- have begun colonizing the strip. Good transportation draws customers from as far away as Westchester and New Jersey. 
 But visits to Fordham Road over the past few months suggest that the street's fortunes are less robust and more complicated than they look, a reflection of the struggles of the surrounding neighborhood. In 1999, median family income in the census tracts bordering Fordham Road was about $19,700, compared with nearly $31,000 for the borough and just over $42,200 for the city. As recently as 2000, nearly a third of the residents of Community Board 7, which covers the neighborhoods surrounding Fordham Road, were receiving public assistance.
 The street beats with an erratic rhythm, in part because the fortunes of those who use it ebb and flow dramatically. Its story is told most eloquently through the fluctuating fortunes of several of the businesses along the seemingly thriving street.

On the Corner With Bill the Greek
 Bill the Greek won't give his age: ''Just say I'm old,'' he said. But he's the dean of Fordham's street vendors. A powerfully built man with shrewd green eyes and a gravelly voice, he has an imposing stage presence that he's used to advantage over the 32 years he has manned his food cart. The cart has become a paradoxical element of stability, long outlasting dozens of nearby brick-and-mortar retailers. He proudly displays a poster-size photo of himself with a grinning Hillary Rodham Clinton, who, he says, loves his kebabs.
 Bill the Greek, a k a Bill Kourdis, worked as a ship engineer before emigrating from Athens in 1961. But as he described his career path, ''Change your country, and you change your business,'' and since 1974, he has been selling fast food near the corner of Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse. He has relocated just once, a mere 50 feet, to a small triangular park, where he chatted during a lull in afternoon trade.
 In his eyes, the lulls are not an anomaly. Like other small-business people in the area, he doesn't quite believe that the surging crowds translate into prosperity. His business, he says, is bad.
 ''There's been a big change, my friend: it's down,'' he said wryly. ''In the 80's, I had triple the business. Sometimes I was tired just counting my money. I sold 50 pretzels a day. Now I'm lucky if I sell two or three.''
 The falloff, he thinks, is a consequence of a post-9/11 economy and a change in what people buy with whatever cash they can scrape together. ''The best time was from '85 up to about '90,'' he said. ''Then rents went up; then after that, every poor family spent its money renting movies. And now, with all the beepers and cellphones, everybody's broke.''

A Little Chain Called Planet Earth
 Raymond Yedid, a compact, voluble 35-year old with black hair and dark eyes who emigrated from Israel in 1982 and opened his first Fordham store six years later, is one of the street's success stories. He now owns a chain of businesses called Planet Earth, an empire of 11 flamboyant, high-energy stores lining both sides of the road that sell everything from Diesel jeans to cellphones. 
 The other day, standing behind a counter at the Planet Earth Communications outlet, Mr. Yedid gestured at the nearly empty store and then toward the crowds outside on the sidewalk. ''Look at the street,'' he said. ''It's mobbed. But there's not many customers in here.''
 Trade was good until Sept. 11, 2001, he said, but then ''it went down almost 50 percent, and it hasn't come back.'' 
 Recent incursions by the chains make him anxious. 
 ''When landlords see big stores, they raise rents,'' he said, ''and now I'm paying a couple more thousand a month just for one store.'' (According to the Fordham BID, commercial rents in the area range from $30 to $80 a square foot.) This, he says, puts pressure on Planet Earth's ability to keep attracting its immigrant customer base with the deep discounts that have kept him going in the past. ''What's good about these small stores,'' Mr. Yedid said, ''is that you can get a good deal. We could bargain, give you a little break. A good customer will always try to bargain. But the big stores won't do nothing.''
 This day, at least, the level of activity in his phone store seemed to bear out his assessment of the state of business. As he chatted with a visitor, only one customer drifted in, and she seemed bewildered. ''You have cellphones, right?'' she asked. ''English, right? I only speak English.'' 

Bargain Heaven at Super Mundo
 Up the hill, just off the Grand Concourse, Concord Men's Wear seemed to share the doldrums. In the window were a $79 suit and a sign advertising a tailor on the premises, but the place was empty, not even a clerk to be seen. 
 Yet a block away, right off Fordham on Valentine Avenue, Super Mundo was crowded. And not because of an inviting facade: Super Mundo, where the ambience is Latino and the soundtrack salsa, camps boldly under the soaring spaces of a huge abandoned synagogue, a relic of the neighborhood's earlier demographics. Customers and merchandise line the broad staircases; appliances and furniture sprawl under the barrel arch above the old sanctuary. Bargains tumble out the front doors and sit along the sidewalks in bins and on racks.
 On a street like Fordham Road, if you offer bargains, they will come.
 On the stairs that originally led to the synagogue's women's section, a boy of about 8 was throwing tassels from the furniture department over the railing and onto the floor below. But nobody paid the slightest attention: the attractions there are the stuffed and piled bins, counters and racks offering prices and variety not even a liquidator could match. 
 Between its brisk customer traffic and pinch-yourself bargains, Super Mundo seemed to be conceding nothing to the chain outlets looming nearby. Plastic garden chairs were going for 80 cents each, dresses for $1.59, all-cotton men's briefs for 40 cents, a stockpot for $8, men's shirts for $5.99, a tuxedo shirt with a wing collar and clip-on bow tie for $9.99. There was even an air-conditioner for $68, which was $20 less than the cheapest unit on display at the new P. C. Richard a block away.
 Jewelry stores, which have multiplied in recent years, seem to be prospering as well. At least a dozen energized competitors line the sidewalks, carrying names like King Jewelers and Big Jake that evoke the fire-sale luxuries they sell. Proudly flaunting their urban ambience, they're as busy as bus stations, often just as scuffed-looking, and wouldn't be out of place on a carnival midway. Cavernous, always thumping to hip-hop, cascades of gold and silver plummeting down the walls and pooling in display cases, they're thick with customers and salesmen.

The World of the Vendor
 Fire-sale luxuries and cheap necessities are essential to Fordham Road's aura of nerve and energy. Despite the multiple forms of credit offered by local banks and merchants, life there crowds up to the edge of solvency, a constant race between enjoying the urge to spend when you have money, and improvising when you run out.
 That pattern has made the area a magnet for street vendors. Bronx peddlers are a species apart from their Manhattan versions, who appear more sporadically and seem to cater to tourists, impulse buyers or people caught without an umbrella in a cloudburst. On Fordham Road, the vendor is crucial to the retail mix, well adapted to a market where low price is paramount, a characteristic that rent-paying merchants like Mr. Yedid find frustrating. 
 ''They just make more mess in front of your store,'' he said, ''and they'll give anything away just to get a couple of dollars.'' 
 Yet not all vendors are profiteers. Bill the Greek gives away any food he has left when he closes up at 3 p.m., and he often sells his kebabs and soda on credit. As he talked, a woman with a distracted expression dashed over and pressed a $5 bill into his hand. ''Here,'' she said before rushing off with her food. ''You know I'm good for the rest.''
 Bill the Greek is a stalwart, working the same corner for decades. But more often vendors are a fluid presence, appearing and vanishing with their cargo of fresh fruit and vegetables, belts, wallets, sunglasses and perfumes, in response to the presence or absence of the police.
 Sometimes they line Fordham Road cheek by jowl, hawking roasted nuts and Sno-Cones; sometimes, after an enforcement sweep, they retreat to lower-profile locations on the side streets.
 Nobody professes to know just how many street vendors, with or without licenses or permits, ply Fordham Road on any given day, and Assistant Chief Michael Collins of the New York Police Department acknowledges that enforcement of regulations is a delicate matter, varying by precinct.
 ''To some, vendors have become more of a priority than street crime,'' Chief Collins said. ''But the regulations are pretty complicated, and we leave it up to each precinct to work it out with the community.'' 
 Merchants may dislike vendors, and they may be a headache to the business improvement district and the police, but enforcement in the Bronx, though vigilant, appears more relaxed than in Manhattan, and for an understandable reason. Everybody seems to realize how drab and monotonous the pavements would seem if the hawkers, with all their variety and their iffy offerings, vanished for good.

Trading Games at Gem Pawnshop
 Even Fordham's oldest and most successful stores -- like Gem Pawnbrokers, which has occupied the same premises for about a century -- survive by accommodating themselves to transience and instability. Unlike the jewelry stores and watch vendors, Gem sells only forfeited goods, yet it is among the street's oldest and most continuously successful businesses. That may be because its core business is the short-term lending of urgently needed cash.
 Gem is usually crowded, and customers chat amiably, even boisterously, with the staff. A flat-panel video screen above the counter shows movies to people waiting in line for loans. The place is spotless, its only hard feature the clinical glare of its fluorescent lighting, and it exudes an improbable but apparently genuine party atmosphere. 
 Faces there, of both customers and staff, are the reverse of grim, even though everybody in the store is there to take out a loan and, this day at least, nobody appeared to be buying. Before leaving, several people stopped to chat with the store's manager, Andre Santiago, a man in his early 40's with a military bearing. He arrived in 1983 after a stint as a correction officer. When a customer asked Freddy, the mustachioed and bejeweled security guard, for advice about what video to rent, he recommended ''Eight Heads in a Duffel Bag.''
 The mood may be jovial, but New York State pawnbroking law allows steep terms: The customer who pawns something gets a loan on its appraised value at 3 percent a month. At Gem, to redeem an item requires 48 hours' notice. In addition to repayment of the principal and interest, Gem charges for insurance and service, which can add to the cost of the loan. 
 Nearly all business comes from repeat customers, and activity is seasonal. ''From spring until December, they pawn,'' Mr. Santiago said. ''When they get their income tax refunds in January, they buy back. In February, around Valentine's Day, they start pawning again.''
 Back in the 1980's, electronics and 35-millimeter cameras were the mainstays of pawning, but they have waned. ''Why should people bring a video camera here when there's eBay, right?'' Mr. Santiago asked. These days, jewelry is the staple item, with a peppering of musical instruments, a testimony to the traditional hand-to-mouth nature of the music business. According to Mr. Santiago, last summer's spike in gasoline prices, accompanied by a rise in the value of gold, led to a new cycle, one in which customers would pawn gold jewelry on Mondays to buy a week's worth of gas, and then would redeem it on payday.
 That pattern seems quintessentially Fordham Road. The street transforms itself not just from year to year but from week to week, in a display of now-flush-now-broke volatility that Manhattan's retail hubs haven't seen for decades. Mom-and-pop stores close overnight, only to be replaced in a matter of weeks. Vendors appear, move, then disappear, all in a flash.
 Sometimes an upmarket retailer drops an exploratory module onto the street -- in 1999 a Starbucks opened. But it folded in 2002. Fordham Road may boom from time to time, but in its own way. It's as far a cry from Century 21 as from Madison Avenue, and likely to remain so.

HEADLINE: 'Breathing Room' for First-Timers

BYLINE: By VALERIE COTSALAS

 BODY:
EVEN though the days of fast-rising real estate values have ended and median home sale prices have actually started to fall on Long Island, many working people still have little hope of buying a home on their own.
 Local governments and housing advocates regularly lament the slim supply of homes affordable even to people earning as much as 30 percent more than the median income on Long Island.
''We're in such a high-cost region,'' said Jim Morgo, commissioner of economic development and work force housing in Suffolk County. ''The lack of homes that workers can afford has hurt the overall sustainability of the region.''
 In a 2005 economic survey by Dowling College in Oakdale, business owners cited this lack as the main obstacle to economic development on Long Island. 
 One source of relief has been the nearly annual adjustment of state and federal financing programs that help eligible buyers with first home purchases in Nassau or Suffolk County. Each adjustment -- raising the maximum price of a house that would qualify for home-buying funds, or raising the income cap for buyers -- opens the assistance program to more people. 
 The latest expansion came last month, when the Long Island Housing Partnership announced that the New York State Legislature had approved a $25 million grant marked to help first-time buyers in Nassau and Suffolk. This money will be available to people who earn up to 130 percent of the median income; previously, the income limit was 120 percent of the median. The program now helps with homes priced up to $450,000; that is $60,000 more than the previous maximum. 
 A buyer can tap into this fund only if his or her employer makes an initial contribution toward the home purchase -- $3,000 to $10,000, depending on the company's size. 
 The employee can then apply for state matching funds of triple that amount to be used toward a down payment on a house. Having reached this stage, home buyers can also receive up to $20,000 for renovations.
 Effective Jan. 1, the new grant money will be available to a single person earning as much as $82,800 annually, a couple earning $94,650 and a family of four earning $118,300.
 To get an idea of how the program works and what the assistance amounts to for a young working couple, consider the Keegan family, who were able to buy a home recently under the limits now in effect. 
 In February, Stephen, 36; Aimee, 29; and their infant son ''just squeaked in'' under the maximum income for a family of three, which was $96,000, Ms. Keegan said. (As of Jan. 1, that will increase to $106,450.)
 Ms. Keegan helps children with development disabilities in her work for the nonprofit Association for the Health of Retarded Children. Mr. Keegan is a retail manager for a food contract services firm on Long Island.
 The Keegans both grew up in Nassau County, she in Elmont and he in Levittown. But together over the last few years, the best they could afford was a one-bedroom rental in a house in Suffolk County -- first in Bay Shore and later in West Islip -- for $1,000 a month.
 ''You're paying all that money, $1,000 a month, and it's not even your own,'' Ms. Keegan said. ''We were throwing money out the window.''
 While on maternity leave, Ms. Keegan read about a program administered by the Long Island Housing Partnership, a nonprofit housing organization, to help middle-class people into the housing market.
 At the time, the maximum home price allowed under the program had been raised above $300,000. ''It allowed us more breathing room,'' Ms. Keegan said. ''It was impossible to find anything on Long Island, not even a shack, for less than that.''
 The Keegans found a Cape Cod-style house they liked in Levittown, asking $360,000. They had saved $10,800, including wedding gifts, toward a down payment.
 Ms. Keegan's employer gave the Keegans $3,000 to help with the down payment. That donation qualified them for $5,000 more in state funds.
 The Keegans then received $14,000 in renovation funds to make alterations that would cut energy costs and correct problems found in an engineer's inspection. These included installing new windows, adding a banister at the bottom of the main staircase and adding a second baseboard heat zone on the second floor. 
 A contractor, Murtha Construction, was brought in by the housing partnership to do the work. ''They were excellent,'' Ms. Keegan said.
 Then came the mortgage. Complying with rules set up by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and New York State, the partnership counsels those who apply for the funds to ensure that they will qualify for a mortgage with an approved lender.
 The Keegans qualified for a 30-year fixed mortgage with a low 5.375 interest rate for first-time home buyers from the State of New York Mortgage Agency. It also paid the Keegans' closing fees, a year of homeowner's insurance and six months of taxes -- all told, Ms. Keegan said, about $13,000. The Keegans must stay in the house at least 10 years or pay back the fees.
 As with most good deals, there was a drawback. It took months for the mortgage to be approved and for the state and federal money to arrive.
 ''The sellers were getting impatient,'' Ms. Keegan said. ''We were very worried and were trying to see what we could do to get it pushed through quicker. That was the downside.''
 The state financing program required documentation of income and assets and three years of income tax returns, as did the state mortgage agency. 
 ''What helped us was that I was home, and I was able to do it without having to rush to work,'' Ms. Keegan said. ''But I would tell people not to be intimidated by the paperwork, because in the end you get so much more than you would anywhere else.''
 Starting in January, according to Peter Elkowitz, president of the housing partnership, a family could receive anywhere from $50,000 to $92,000 in assistance, mainly depending on their income.
 The new $25 million grant will also benefit those who buy in downtown areas, Mr. Elkowitz said. A developer who provides five or more below-market-rate homes in a downtown area can qualify each unit's buyers for $25,000 from the state, up to $1.5 million per development.
 The Keegans closed on their Levittown Cape on June 30 and moved in the next day.
 Ms. Keegan is still ecstatic about the assistance that she and her husband received to buy their house. ''Until we were in this program,'' she said, ''we were thinking of leaving Long Island.'' Recently married friends of theirs did just that, moving to New Jersey for less expensive housing.
 Many young adults cannot afford to buy on Long Island, Ms. Keegan said. ''Without a program like this, you wouldn't be able to do it.''

HEADLINE: A Diesel Fit for Polite Society

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
TAKE it from someone who spent a childhood in the backseat of diesel-powered cars: they stunk. 
 It wasn't just the noxious spew from the tailpipe or the kerosene odor you endured while filling up next to towering 18-wheelers. The engines clattered and shook, or they refused to start at all on frigid Michigan mornings. They even caused cancer: several studies found the sooty exhaust to be a carcinogen, and it was linked to asthma, heart attacks and premature deaths.
My only fond diesel memory was how my penny-pinching father coaxed 300,000 miles from his oil-burning Mercedes-Benz cars and International Harvester trucks, which invariably outlived their rusting bodies.
 So when I say the new Mercedes E320 Bluetec is one impressive machine, it is not a judgment colored by nostalgia. Swift, quiet and odor-free, this is definitely not my daddy's diesel. Indeed, the Bluetec probably strikes the best combination of space, performance and efficiency on the road. 
 You associate 38 miles a gallon with squirrel-driven subcompacts, not a powerful midsize luxury sedan. But that is the mileage the Mercedes test car delivered in 250 miles of highway cruising. The Bluetec also posted a thrifty 28 m.p.g. in the city. Both numbers exceeded the car's federal rating of 37 on the highway, 27 in town.
 With its sizable 21.1-gallon tank, travel range becomes a selling point: the Bluetec can cover a remarkable 700-plus highway miles on a tank, or enough to travel from New York to Indianapolis (or from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City). Such all-day range saves time as well as money. Based on the 32 m.p.g. that my test car returned over all, an owner who drives 15,000 miles a year will pull over for fuel just twice a month.
 If there is a downside, at least it is temporary. While the E320 Bluetec is currently the world's cleanest diesel -- and like all diesels, it produces 20 to 40 percent less greenhouse gases than gasoline engines -- its levels of smog-forming nitrogen oxides still preclude its sale in California and four Northeast states, including New York, that follow California's emissions rules.
 That is likely to change in 2008, when a final piece of technology should let Mercedes diesels meet even stricter 50-state standards that take effect in 2009. Once federal regulators sign off, several Mercedes models will carry a small tank of urea, a fluid that releases ammonia to convert smoggy nitrogen oxides into nitrogen and water. The tank must be replenished every 15,000 miles or so, in a process akin to an oil change. 
 But for now, the E320 is the only 2007-model diesel automobile in the United States, to be joined next year by a Jeep Grand Cherokee and three other Mercedes models. Honda recently showed its own diesel that will, it says, meet the 50-state standards within three years with no need for urea. By 2009, General Motors plans to sell a urea-free 50-state diesel V-8 in a pickup truck. Diesels from three other German carmakers -- Audi, BMW and Volkswagen -- are expected to use similar technology. That outpouring wouldn't be possible without a momentous shift that starts today: a federally mandated rollout of diesel fuel from which 97 percent of the polluting sulfur has been removed. Once diesel's sworn enemies, environmental and regulatory groups are hailing the move, which Stephen L. Johnson, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, called ''the single greatest achievement in clean fuel since the removal of lead from gasoline'' in the 1970's. 
 The E.P.A. estimates that the greener fuel will ultimately save $150 billion a year in health and welfare costs and prevent 20,000 premature deaths annually.
 As with the adoption of unleaded gas, the cleaner fuel opens the door to pollution-fighting gear that should make diesels as clean as the top gas models. In contrast to ethanol, available in far fewer than 1 percent of the nation's 170,000 gas stations, diesel is pumped at 40 percent of them.
 The diesel E-Class is largely indistinguishable from gas versions: same styling, same luxurious interior, same cavernous trunk. All '07 E-Classes have a mildly revamped exterior and interior and an excellent seven-speed automatic transmission.
 Now, 208 horsepower may not sound that forceful. But take a look at the 400 pound-feet of torque, which exceeds that of the 500-horsepower BMW M5 sedan. Commanding torque -- the thrust you feel when racing away from a stoplight -- is the secret weapon of diesel engines. Abetted by a turbocharger in the E320 Bluetec, this results in swift 0-to-60 acceleration of 6.6 seconds. 
 That is neck and neck with the car's gas-powered V-6 twin, the E350 sedan. Yet in my testing, the Bluetec sipped far less fuel, beating the E350 by about 40 percent: 32 m.p.g. over all, versus 23 for the E350.
 As for other differences, the E320 skews toward luxury and a comfortable ride, forgoing the E350 Sport's lower stance, sportier bodywork and firmer suspension. The 16-inch wheels and tires (designed to optimize economy) look a bit scrawny and don't grip as well as the 18-inchers on the E350 Sport.
 The engine is slightly louder at idle, though not obtrusive. Precise common-rail fuel injection raises power while cutting emissions and noise; the cleaner fuel burns more quietly and completely. 
 Under acceleration, the diesel's deep drone is less pleasing, but at a steady cruise, the car is so smooth and quiet that even a sharp-eared engineer might not realize there is a diesel engine is under the hood. 
 For luxury buyers who have suddenly awakened to the imperatives of economy and conservation, this is a no-brainer bargain. With a base price of $52,325, Mercedes is charging just $1,000 extra for the frugal engine and Bluetec emissions system, compared with the gasoline V-6. Contrast that with the big premiums for luxury hybrids: the Lexus GS 450h costs $8,000 more than the gasoline V-6 version, yet its overall E.P.A. rating is just 1 m.p.g. higher, at 25.
 In the real world, this means that in about two years the Mercedes -- even with diesel now going for only pennies less, on average, than premium gas -- will save an owner enough in fuel bills to offset its added cost. 
 In contrast, the owner of a Lexus GS 450h might as well be Rip Van Winkle: he will have to drive the car more than 130 years to get back the premium.

INSIDE TRACK: Fill it and forget it.

HEADLINE: Keeping It 'Green' With Panels and More

BYLINE: By COLLEEN KALEDA

DATELINE: MOUNT HOOD, Ore. 

 BODY:
A QUIRKY piece of Pacific Northwest logging history is built into Tom Kelly's new home tucked beneath the northern shadow of Oregon's tallest volcano. Century-old logs that once fell off a Columbia River barge now form stylish support beams in the kitchen and living areas. 
 The beams are just one of myriad ''green'' features that helped Mr. Kelly's house become the first single-family home in the West to be certified by the United States Green Building Council, a nonprofit group based in Washington.
Mr. Kelly, owner of the Neil Kelly Company, a residential builder, walked the perimeter of the house, watching his photovoltaic panels as they tilt to capture the sun's rays. The day is bright, and the solar panels pump 2,320 watts of surplus energy into the local utility grid. The wattage is recorded as a credit, then ''used'' to heat the house this winter. Mr. Kelly intends to be warm after a long day of skiing with his wife, Barbara Woodford, and their two sons. 
 Some green features are easy to see, like the arctic entryway -- a space with two doors that traps cold air before it seeps into the main house. Others are not, like special landscaping. 
 The 1,932-square-foot home was designed for climate control: It is set on the lot so that on a warm day prevailing mountain winds are funneled through high windows.
 ''There's lots of little choices that you make along the way that accumulate to be the overall solution to having a really energy-efficient house,'' Mr. Kelly said.
 Rooted in the commercial sector, green building is catching on for residences. The newest variant is the ''net zero energy'' home which, like Mr. Kelly's, over the course of a full year draws no more energy from the local utility grid than it sends to it.
 Some green-built homes do not tap the local utility grid at all. But many experts argue that being on the grid is actually a greener practice. Tapping into already-built power and water systems takes fewer resources than, say, maintaining new generators and batteries for solar energy systems. 
 A home can be considered green for many reasons, from the eclectic (grass roofing) to the common (ecologically sensitive paint) to the obscure (wheat board cabinetry). Still, buyers and builders can be confused over what constitutes a green house. Must it be constructed with hay-bale walls and bamboo floors? Or can a house be green by simply consuming less energy and water? 
 To create a national standard, the United States Green Building Council recently started a certification program for houses. Called LEED for Homes (the acronym stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), it is a spinoff of the council's commercial program. 
 It is residential builders who are driving the trend, experts say. ''A lot of home buyers are not going to go out and ask for a green-built home,'' said Jay Hall, manager of the LEED for Homes program.
 He said it would continue to be up to the industry to educate buyers. Conferences like Greenbuild, organized by the United States Green Building Council, aim to show builders how to market green homes. But some builders simply claim to build green, so consumers should find out if their home has gone through independent certification.
 ''Anyone can call themselves green builders -- and they do,'' Mr. Hall said.
 To date, only about a dozen homes in the country have been certified under the building council's criteria, intended to set the bar higher than local or regional programs that already exist in many states. 
 Though Mr. Kelly's home was first to gain certification in the West, it was fourth in the nation. It followed homes in Oklahoma City; Freeport, Me.; and Grand Rapids, Mich. The council has been flooded with requests; about 700 are in its registry for review and another 700 are in the application phase.
 Despite major growth in the last five years, residential green building is still a niche market for small and medium-size builders, though large companies are trying to cash in on the trend. DRHorton Homes, one of the largest home builders in the nation, for example, is seeking council certification for every unit in a 100-home subdivision in Sacramento. 
 California, Oregon and Washington lead the nation in residential green building, Mr. Hall said. Portland is one of a handful of cities that have public tours of green homes, conducted through its Office of Sustainable Development. The city is also home to Earth Advantage, among the most stringent green building certification organizations in the nation. Unlike some organizations that rely on self-reporting by builders, it independently checks construction, usually three times for each home or development. 
 But what does green building really mean?
 ''It's hard to put in a sound bite,'' said Duane Woik, a green building consultant for Earth Advantage. ''It's not something the consumer really understands. It needs to be explained to them.''
 Earth Advantage says green building entails energy efficiency, indoor air quality, durability and minimal site impact. Mr. Woik and his staff check installations and materials within each of the four criteria, which earn ''points'' for builders that add up to certification. 
 Builders, depending on cost and customers' preferences, can cut back in some areas and splurge on others. ''Our program is a way for a builder to improve his risk management.'' Mr. Woik said. ''It's an extra set of eyes out there.''
 Whether building custom homes or simply buying green, homeowners should expect to pay more. Mr. Hall estimates green building increases a home's cost about 5 percent over a traditionally built house, though that percentage can rise, depending on materials.
 In Mr. Kelly's home, a black bar countertop made from recycled newspaper, kitchen counters of polished broken wine and beer bottle glass, and Douglas fir from old vinegar vats added extra cost.
 In a more modest house -- for example, a $300,000 house with a 30-year mortgage -- adding 5 percent for green features would increase mortgage payments by $70 a month. Normally, Mr. Hall said, a green-built home will absorb that monthly increase in utility savings.
 After becoming passionate about green architecture and consulting, Nathan Good started his Salem-based architectural firm 18 months ago. He designs custom green homes but is also consulting on a development on the Oregon coast and a subdivision south of Portland.
 Entire neighborhoods designed as green, he said, can offer community benefits like streets with permeable pavement that allows rainwater to seep directly into the ground and reduce the impact on municipal storm sewers. A green home that Mr. Good designed in Cannon Beach, Ore., won the National Association of Home Builders 2005 Custom Green Home of the Year award. 
 Mr. Good says he is finding his custom home clients -- who range widely in age -- often know more than he about green materials and techniques. ''As an architect, I really have to be on my toes because my clients are very well educated,'' he said.


CORRECTION-DATE: October 29, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in Real Estate on Oct. 15 featured homes in the Pacific Northwest that were constructed with environmentally sensitive building methods and materials. The article reported that the United States Building Council had begun a national certification program for these ''green'' houses, and quoted Tom Kelly, a Portland builder whose home was the first in the West to receive certification.
After the article appeared, a reader alerted The Times that Mr. Kelly had made financial contributions to a nonprofit organization in Seattle for which the writer of The Times article, a freelancer, had worked. The group, Sightline Institute, which promotes a sustainable economy in the Pacific Northwest, had hired the freelance writer to help with editing and writing projects.
 The writer did not list her work at Sightline when she filled out a contract that The Times requires of all freelancers. She later told The Times that she had not been aware of Mr. Kelly's connection to Sightline when she quoted him in the article. Had Times editors been aware of her association with Sightline, they would not have given her the assignment.

HEADLINE: Sampling the Diverse Output of Artists From China

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

 BODY:
BEFORE the late 1990's, exhibitions by Chinese artists were a rare sight in United States museums. With economic change and the gradual opening of Chinese society, a few more began to appear, but they still tended to be by those who had emigrated from China in search of professional opportunities -- that is, artists who now lived here and who clustered mostly in and around New York. 
 In recent years, the contingent of Chinese artists showing in museums here has grown much larger and more varied. China-based artists now regularly exhibit in New York commercial galleries and in museums nationally, and many Chinese artists based in the United States have begun to reconnect with their homeland, exhibiting work in China after decades of absence. 
Right now, an exhibition at the Visual Arts Center of New Jersey tracks the changing status and migratory patterns of Chinese artists, touching on issues of identity and culture shock. The center completed a $6.5 million renovation last year; this is the sixth exhibition in its impressive new galleries. 
 The show opens with a video by Lin Yilin, an artist from southern China whom I met in the early 1990's at his home in Guangzhou. Back then he was part of Big Tail Elephant Group, a funky collective of Chinese experimental artists working in performance, video and installation -- art forms banned in China at the time. (They are now accepted and even taught in Chinese art schools.) Those were scary times for contemporary artists in China.
 Mr. Lin has a talent for nutty theatrical performances, which he captures in grainy videos. Here he is seen standing on a traffic island in the middle of a busy intersection somewhere in China giving mock directions in the manner of a traffic officer. Such officers used to be ubiquitous in China, where until recently there were no traffic lights because so few people owned cars. 
 From here the exhibition broadens to include the work of some of the better-known Chinese artists based in the United States, people like Xu Bing, Lin Yan and Wenda Gu, all of whom emigrated to the United States in the late 1980's and early 1990's. These days they are busy, sought-after artists, and the exhibition's curator, Zhijian Qian, has done well to wrest important works from each for the present show. It is a quiet coup.
 Mr. Xu presents a major continuing installation titled ''New English Calligraphy'' (1995-2006), in which audience members are invited into a kind of classroom with tables, chairs and paper and encouraged via an instructional video to try their hand at New English Calligraphy. This hybrid language invented by the artist renders English words as Chinese calligraphic characters. It is brilliant.
 Mr. Gu has long worked with human hair, braiding and weaving it into reels out of which he makes hanging sculptures and wall paintings that resemble scrolls. Here he has a pair of installations, the most impressive of which is a suspended tent structure made from a single continuous braid of human hair several miles long. Restrictions imposed by the building have prevented a proper installation of the work from the ceiling, but it has been arranged in such a way that it offers a good sense of the artist's intention.
 Mr. Xu and Mr. Gu were not the first Chinese artists to come to the United States. Others arrived in the early 1980's, including Zhang Hongtu, who moved to New York in 1982 and lived for a time in New Jersey. He makes humorous paintings and sculptures that fuse and combine historical references to Eastern and Western art. His works have a distinctive Chinese voice, but are about living elsewhere.
 The exhibition includes several of Mr. Zhang's vast oil paintings, which fuse traditional Chinese scroll painting imagery with visual elements of famous Western modernist masterpieces. In one piece here Mr. Zhang repaints a famous work by the traditional 10th-century Chinese painter-scholar Jing Hao in the garishly-colored, somewhat turbulent style of Vincent van Gogh. It is a very unusual fusion. 
 Mr. Zhang's best-known works are disposable fast-food containers cast in bronze to resemble ancient and valuable Shang dynasty (circa 1766-1050 B.C.) archeological artifacts -- a bronze McDonald's Big Mac box, for instance. They are provocative, pleasurable and fun, fusing Eastern and Western cultural traditions to create hybrid objects you could never have imagined. You can only hoot and admire.

HEADLINE: College Students, Poor but Rich in City's Eyes

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

 BODY:
College students like to complain about their empty pockets, but in New Brunswick, their poverty has put money in the city coffers.
 Because of the way the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development calculates the formula for its Community Development Block Grants, students living off campus who earn less than $9,800 a year contribute significantly. 
Of the 48,573 people living in New Brunswick, home to Rutgers University, 11,454, or 27 percent, are below the poverty line, the department says. But if the 3,970 eligible off-campus students were taken out of the equation, the city's poverty rate would slide to 18 percent.
 The poverty rate is not the only factor in determining a city's block grant, but it is a big one. According to federal figures, if the students were not included, the New Brunswick grant for 2006 would be $688,000, not $827,000, a 17 percent difference.
 ''That still doesn't mean we are affluent,'' said Glenn Patterson, the city's director of planning, community and economic development. 
 ''New Brunswick uses this money wisely and needs it,'' he added.
 He said that in recent years the city had used the grant money for rehabilitating low-income housing, demolishing abandoned housing, planning studies, cleaning up parks, increasing police patrols and paving streets. 
 Mr. Patterson said that more affluent college towns like Ann Arbor, Mich., and Palo Alto, Calif., also get substantial increases in block grants because of low student incomes. 
 Camden and Newark, two cities with much poverty, are getting smaller block grants because Rutgers students who live off campus there push the income level up. If the formula did not count them, the cities would receive increases of 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively, in their block grants.
 Housing and Urban Development staff members have urged that the formula be changed to disregard, or at least diminish the effect of, the student poverty rate. Congress is scheduled to consider it after the November elections.

HEADLINE: A Real Old-Timers' Game

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
NEXT Saturday, the Flemington Neshanock and the Elizabeth Athletic Club will play an exhibition base ball game at Riverbank Park in Newark. 
 On exhibit will be men dressed in baggy 19th-century uniforms with woolen caps, long pants, even knickers and high stockings, playing a brand of vintage base ball -- the spelling of the era -- by the rules that governed the national pastime during the days of the Civil War.
Fans, or cranks, as they were known in the mid-1800's, should bring a scorecard (and maybe an eraser) for the journey back to those early innings, when it was one, two, three -- or sometimes four -- strikes you're out at the old ball game. While vendors may no longer be selling apples, sarsaparilla or birch beer, spectators will find an authentic slice of American heritage. 
 ''This game is not a re-enactment, but a recreation of the way the game was played in those times, using the very same rules from those years,'' said Paul Salomone, the captain of the Elizabeth Athletic Club. 
 ''Nothing we do out there is scripted,'' added Mr. Salomone, 49, who lives in Westfield, N.J., where the Elizabeth team is based. ''We are very competitive, but at the same time, we do our best to show spectators what fans of 19th-century base ball would have seen.''
 And what they might have heard.
 ''Well struck!'' players from that era would yell after a teammate made solid contact at the plate. ''Well done, sir,'' a fielder might be told after making a good play.
 ''It was a gentleman's game back then, so these are words that would have actually been spoken,'' said Brad Shaw, 52, the captain of the Flemington squad, who lives in Raritan Township, N.J. ''Sure, players got angry once in a while, but for the most part, these guys were all friends who treated the game, and each other, with respect -- and they rarely argued with an umpire.''
 Saturday's showcase will feature a Flemington team that adheres to base ball rules from the 1860's and 70's, when pitchers threw underhand and fielders did not wear gloves, and an Elizabeth team that plays by the rules of 1891, when pitchers had begun throwing overhand and a few position players wore gloves just slightly larger than their hands. 
 The Flemington and Elizabeth teams are among 55 clubs that play in the Vintage Base Ball Association, a nonprofit barnstorming circuit across 32 states that runs from April to October. 
 Scheduled for 10 innings, the game Saturday will be split in half, allowing each team to play its chosen style for five innings. Modern-day cranks will learn that batters were called strikers and ground balls up the middle were called daisy cutters.
 Then there are the rules, which Mr. Salomone and Mr. Shaw said were as difficult for the players to grasp as for their fans.
 ''It takes a lot of imagination to transform yourself into an 1891 ballplayer,'' Mr. Salomone said. ''It's a lot of fun, but very challenging.'' 
 To illustrate that point, Mr. Shaw imagined a situation involving an outfielder in the mid-1800's playing a line drive on one hop. The batter would not be credited with a base hit, but would be called out. 
 While vintage base ball is popular in New Jersey, it made an initial comeback in 1980 in Old Bethpage, N.Y., to coincide with the annual Long Island Fair. Eleven teams, including the Cold Spring Spiders, Glen Head Zig Zags and Bellmore Seminoles -- actual names of 19th-century clubs -- competed on the Hewlett Playing Grounds at the Old Bethpage Village Restoration, playing an 1860's style of base ball.
 Next April, an organization calling itself the Vintage Base Ball Federation will begin operation with an estimated 100 teams in 15 to 20 states. It was founded by the former major league pitcher Jim Bouton, who will serve as its commissioner, and Greg Martin, its president. The board includes Fay Vincent, the former Major League Baseball commissioner; Frank Deford, the veteran sports journalist; John Thorn, a baseball historian; and Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist. 
 Mr. Martin, who lives in Hartford, organized vintage base ball tournaments there from 2000 to 2004, three-day events that drew more than a dozen teams and up to 10,000 fans a year. He also opened the Hartford-based Vintage Base Ball Factory, which manufactures 19th-century uniforms and equipment. 
 In July 2004, Mr. Martin and Mr. Bouton teamed up to organize what Mr. Martin called ''a farewell game,'' in Pittsfield, Mass. The game was to be played at Wahconah Park, a longtime minor league ballpark that was to undergo a multimillion-dollar restoration to give it an antiquated look, including signs of the era, wooden grandstands and a manually operated scoreboard.
 Two months before that game, Mr. Thorn discovered a document from 1791 suggesting that a version of baseball was already being played at that time in Pittsfield. Before then, the creation of baseball had been widely credited to Abner Doubleday in Cooperstown, N.Y., in 1839, though some later traced the game's beginnings to Hoboken, N.J., in 1846. More recently, a New York University librarian found two newspaper references to a form of ''base ball'' in 1823 in New York City. 
 With Pittsfield in the national headlines, ESPN Classic decided to present the so-called farewell game on television, and 6,500 fans filled the ballpark, built to seat 4,000. 
 The cranks went to see a team called the Pittsfield Hillies, put together by Mr. Bouton, play the Hartford Senators, assembled by Mr. Martin. The Hillies played an early 20th-century style of baseball, the Senators a late-19th-century version. Outside the park, actors playing turn-of-the-century newsboys held newspapers detailing the day's events. ''Extra! Extra!'' they shouted. ''Read all about it!'' 
 ''That game in Pittsfield was really the inspiration for where we are today,'' Mr. Martin said. ''It reconfirmed my vision that vintage base ball could be packaged and marketed. After ESPN covered the event, I saw a bigger potential in terms of growing the concept nationally.'' 
 While the vintage groups are not exactly rivals, Mr. Salomone of the Vintage Base Ball Association and others contend that the Vintage Base Ball Federation is not always playing by the rules of the era.
 ''They are intentionally designing their league to be historically inaccurate,'' Mr. Salomone said. ''They feel that by combining different aspects of the game from different eras, they are somehow providing more entertainment for their spectators.''
 To that, Mr. Bouton replied, ''We've simply decided to cover a swath of time as opposed to any single year, and to incorporate the most interesting rules and equipment that were in use during the latter half of the 19th century, because that is a really fun way of looking at history.''
 ''They are historians, they want to focus on a given year and get it exactly right, which is one way to do it,'' he said of the Vintage Base Ball Association. ''What we are is a combination of theater, history and unscripted sports competition, and by using excellent players, we are also capturing the athleticism of those times.''

HEADLINE: Fresh Sea Legs for a Bygone Port

BYLINE: By JEFF VANDAM. 
E-mail: streetlevel@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE midnight blue banners of the Downtown Staten Island Council whip in the wind over Front Street, but there is hardly a downtown in sight. Weeds, gravel, glass and lots full of dead cars line the road; in the background, a train occasionally hurtles past. Quiet businesses like Unique Electric stare out at a pockmarked roadway and a fence topped with curlicued barbed wire.
 Yet Front Street and the land beyond the inhospitable fence are hailed as the potential birthplace of a new Stapleton. Wedged between the street and the waterfront is the Homeport, a closed naval base that over the years has attracted many development schemes and little action. But, at long last, a plan is well afoot. This month, the City Council is scheduled to vote on a $66 million plan, already approved by the City Planning Commission, to make the Homeport a large extension of the neighborhood by providing apartments, a sports complex and parkland. 
 ''After a decade of missteps, it is a relief,'' said Michael McMahon, the local councilman.
 Nevertheless, Stapleton is not wall-to-wall smiles. Local residents, for instance, want fewer new apartments, while local merchants, seeking customers, want more. 
 ''City Planning has approved 350 units,'' said Michael Behar, chairman of the Downtown Council, which represents local businesses. ''We feel what would be more appropriate is 3,500 units. To support a vibrant community, you need people, people, people. You need density.''
 Cynthia Mailman, president of a local homeowner group called the Mud Lane Society, bluntly dismissed such notions. ''I don't want Manhattan here,'' said Ms. Mailman, an artist and retired art professor from Queensborough Community College. ''I don't think that's why you come to Staten Island. And you start blocking other people's views, which is awful.''
 The Homeport, a collection of warehouse-style buildings with slate-blue roofs, was shut in 1994 as part of a nationwide closing of military bases. The idling of the Homeport was not a stunning blow; nothing much had ever happened there. The main ship that the base was designed to serve, the U.S.S. Iowa, had suffered a deadly turret explosion in 1989 and never docked at the facility. Since the port was shuttered, public agencies like the New York Police Department and the state courts have made use of its idle offices. 
 But plenty of grand plans have been floated for the former naval base. Among them were a dock for casino boats, a coal port, a high-speed auto racetrack and a minor-league hockey rink. Most recently, the actor Danny Aiello was among those who campaigned for a movie studio and entertainment complex there.
 All these ideas sputtered and died, with some failures hurting more than others. ''The biggest disappointment to the Stapleton community was the loss of the movie studio,'' said Joseph Carroll, district manager for Community Board 1.''I can't pretend it didn't happen.''
 The current plan seems on the verge of success. In its current shape, it features apartment houses up to five stories, an indoor soccer field and ice-skating rink, and parkland fringed by a waterfront esplanade.
 Residents and merchants may square off over the number of new apartments, but they agree on matters like keeping stores out of the new development. That way, newcomers would have to shop at existing stores on nearby Bay Street, the area's main retail strip, and in so doing would weave the new complex into the old neighborhood. 
 The avenue could use new shoppers. Its mainstays now include older merchants like the Bay Street Bazaar, a haphazardly arranged market with a dingy yellow awning, and the Paramount Theater, which sits shuttered, its Art Deco columns peeling. 
 Bay Street shows some signs of perking up, however. A few businesses have opened, among them Papa Joe's Fishouse, new this year, and a baby furniture store, where the flags marking its opening are still aflutter. A developer has even proposed constructing two five-story buildings, with 161 co-op apartments in all, on a weedy parking lot between Bay Street and the railroad tracks. 
 For Ms. Mailman, a benefit of the new plan may be a new name for the land behind the barbed wire. She objects to the term Homeport, noting that the naval base was never active. But doesn't something like Stapleton Waterfront sound nice?

HEADLINE: Seeking Change On Brooklyn's Piers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Landlocked in New York,'' by Jason H. Kramer (Op-Ed, Oct. 8): 
 The city's plan for Piers 7 through 12 in Brooklyn is to establish job-intensive, maritime industrial uses, expand cruise uses and provide waterfront access.
Allowing American Stevedoring, a private company operating on the piers today, to continue to underutilize the important space would mean ignoring a prime opportunity to create full-time, industrial maritime jobs.
 Since 1991, American Stevedoring has been handed more than $60 million in public subsidy to operate on the Red Hook piers with little to show for it. 
 The piers handle only 1 percent of the containers that enter the port today, and of these containers, 90 percent are barged back to New Jersey for distribution via truck. 
 It is an inefficient process possible only with subsidy, and, what's worse, it supports only 150 part-time jobs.
 We have an enormous opportunity to reinvigorate Brooklyn's working waterfront on these piers, and the administration has identified companies that are prepared to step in and create 450 full-time, industrial jobs. 
 Given our goals to revitalize the waterfront, support the industrial sector and create jobs in all five boroughs, we have a responsibility to ensure that the piers are put to productive use.

HEADLINE: A Love-Hate Relationship Bears a 50-State Diesel

BYLINE: By KEVIN CAMERON

 BODY:
ASSIGNMENTS this juicy are rare in the career of an automotive engineer: the opportunity to develop a new generation of high-efficiency diesel engines that would lead a major company into a fuel-sipping low-emissions future.
 It was a challenge that Kenichi Nagahiro, whose portfolio as a Honda senior engineer included Formula One racing engines and the company's VTEC variable valve timing technology, should have relished. Instead, he turned it down. 
Mr. Nagahiro eventually relented, agreeing to head the program -- but only if he had a free hand to design an engine that would overcome his disdain for the noisy, smelly diesels previously on the market. 
 The initial product of the program -- the first diesel engine designed entirely by Honda -- was introduced in 2003 to power a European version of the Accord. A British advertising campaign played off Mr. Nagahiro's reluctance, asking, ''What if a diesel engine was built by someone who hates them?'' Television commercials featured Garrison Keillor singing a tune called ''Hate Something, Change Something.'' 
 The project did far more than simply tame a problematic alternative to gasoline engines. Last month, Honda announced that it would bring the 2.2-liter diesel, which it calls the i-CTDi engine, to the United States within three years. The company says that the engine will meet the demanding Tier II Bin 5 regulations, allowing it to be sold in America's largest auto markets -- California and the Northeast states that have adopted California's regulations -- where new diesel cars have not been sold since tailpipe pollutant levels were tightened beyond the reach of available engine technology. 
 Honda is not the only automaker to promise a 50-state diesel; Mercedes-Benz has said it plans to sell diesel versions of its sport utility vehicles across the country in 2008. The first phase of the Mercedes emissions-control system, known as Bluetec, is used in the 2007 E320; next year's 50-state version for three sport utility models will also be equipped with AdBlue, a process that injects liquid urea into the exhaust, enabling a chemical reaction that reduces the output of smog-forming nitrogen oxides. Neither the Honda and nor the Mercedes systems have been through the certfication process. 
 But Honda, the company whose clean-burning CVCC Civic model did the seemingly impossible in the 1970's by meeting emissions standards, has not lost its knack for innovation. The company says the i-CTDi turbodiesel engine will meet the regulations using a much simpler emissions-control system; it requires no added fluids to keep emissions in check.
 Diesel engines achieve high fuel economy by a combination of high compression ratio (16.7:1 in this Honda), lean combustion (a high proportion of air to fuel) and low pumping loss (because they have no throttle). But diesel tailpipes spew higher amounts of nitrogen oxides than comparable gasoline engines, and they are harder to clean up. The three-way catalytic converter, a technology highly effective on gasoline engines, eliminating up to 99 percent of nitrogen oxides, can cut those emissions by only 10 percent or so on diesels -- not nearly enough. 
 Ben Knight, vice president for research and development of American Honda, said that the major components of the i-CTDi engine's emissions-control strategy were improved combustion within the engine and effective aftertreatment -- an industry buzzword for the devices that chemically convert exhaust pollutants to harmless gases. 
 The engine uses common-rail fuel injection at very high pressure, about 30,000 pounds per square inch. Such pressures deliver the fuel more quickly, giving it more time to evaporate. It also breaks the fuel into smaller droplets, increasing its total surface area. High injection velocity -- close to the speed of sound -- ensures that the droplets penetrate deeply into the highly compressed air in the cylinder. The more uniformly fuel and air are mixed during diesel injection, the lower the output of nitrogen oxides. 
 Cooled exhaust gas is recirculated to the cylinders, also reducing combustion temperature and further cutting the production of nitrogen oxides.
 Exhaust gas from the cylinders is piped first to an oxidation catalyst in which carbon monoxide and any unburned hydrocarbons are combined with oxygen to complete their combustion into carbon dioxide and water. Next, the exhaust gases pass through a particulate filter, which removes the carbon particles that in older models made diesel exhaust smoky. The last step, new and crucial to passing the toughest regulations, is cutting nitrogen oxides.
 Instead of adding liquid from an onboard reservoir to produce the ammonia needed to clean up the nitrogen oxides, as the Mercedes Bluetec system does, the Honda makes its own ammonia as it goes, combining hydrogen with nitrogen inside a two-layer catalyst. Honda's catalyst for scrubbing out nitrogen oxides operates in two stages. In normal operation, when the fuel mixture is lean, nitrogen oxides in the exhaust are trapped, or adsorbed, onto the lower layer of the catalyst. When the engine's control computer switches it to rich combustion for a few seconds, hydrogen is released from the exhaust gases. This reacts with the nitrogen from the adsorbed gases to form ammonia, which is stored by adsorption in the catalyst's upper layer. 
 Then, as the engine returns to lean operation, the ammonia reacts with nitrogen oxides in the exhaust stream to produce water and nitrogen. 
 Mr. Knight said that the 2.2-liter turbocharged engine developed 138 horsepower at 4,000 r.p.m., with peak torque of 251 pound-feet at 2,000 r.p.m. Asked what the ratio of lean to rich operation might be, he gave the example of a 60-mile-an-hour cruise, at which the engine would operate lean for three minutes, then rich for five seconds. This system is effective for the light loads of passenger car use, and in the relatively low temperature of diesel exhaust.
 Will this system work with larger engines? Mr. Knight said a V-6 application was being studied. 
 Honda says that with the i-CTDi, it is hard to tell by the sound that the car is diesel-powered. Combined city/highway fuel economy is projected at nearly 42 miles a gallon for the Accord sedan; 0-60 acceleration takes 9.2 seconds.

A two-layer catalytic converter works in stages, adsorbing nitrogen oxides in normal operation to temporarily trap the smog-forming pollutant. An occasional burst of extra fuel produces ammonia in another part of the catalyst, which converts the nitrogen oxides to harmless nitrogen gas.Diagram of two-layer catalytic converter highlighting:Carbon monoxide-hydrocarbon converterParticulate filterNitrogen oxides converterNitrogen oxides are adsorbed in normal operation.Nitrogen oxides are converted to nitrogen gas using ammonia produced in the converter.(pg. 2)

HEADLINE: Impossible Author Dies at 70

BYLINE: By Henry Alford. 
Henry Alford is the author of ''Municipal Bondage'' and ''Big Kiss.''

 BODY:
[Impossible Author], who has died aged 70, was a talented television journalist, writer and photographer; he was also a nightmare drunk.1 He died of a heart attack in an airliner over the Atlantic after an argument concerning what he insisted was his right to have his seat ''upgraded.'' 2 His body was discovered attired in a frogman's outfit.3
''I Am an Alcoholic'' (1959) recounted how his political life had been ruined by the demon drink.4 Meanwhile [Impossible] had developed a curious technique for writing novels, whereby he would cut several pages into quarters and then join them up willy-nilly, in the hope that chance would produce some new and poetic effect.5 A publisher to whom he submitted his most outrageously nauseating book, ''I Was Dora Suarez'' (1984), claimed to have vomited when he read the manuscript.6 
 [Impossible] was a very good talker, but limited by deafness. He used to detach his hearing aid at luncheon not, he said, to banish bores but because the ancient contraption made horrible noises when wine was being poured into his glass.7 To encounter [Impossible] at 9 in the evening in the Colony Room Club, for example, was to witness a transformation that any film actor in ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' would have thought strained credibility. Within minutes, fueled by a rapid series of large gins scarcely diluted by tonic, his polite talks about his great-uncle Bram Stoker or his interlocutor's latest book would turn into a rant of increasing volume and decreasing intelligibility: ''I loathe you, I can't stand you,'' he would roar, gargling in his podgy throat.8
 [Impossible] himself began writing in the 1940's, locking himself in a stall in the men's room in the subway. Making his base of operations the Angle bar at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue, he sold drugs at times and himself at others, not always with notable success.9 [Impossible] looked like Truman Capote and sounded like Bette Davis.10 
 But there were bad memories, too.11 It was his habit, for example, to howl at the moon. In 1984 he was in a bar in California when other drinkers took exception to his howling. Matters came to a head when he decided to exorcise a neighboring drinker, who hit him over the head with a shovel, shouting: ''I'll knock the Devil out of you!''12 He also kept explosives, to blow the legs off pool tables or to pack in a barrel for target practice.13 He held several exhibitions of paintings on wood riddled with bullet holes (''shotgun art'' he called it; he was also a member of the National Rifle Association).14 He was barred from several hotels for trivial offenses such as being found with his trousers round his ankles in the corridor.15 ''Mainly I sleep with cats and the female,'' he once said, describing his domestic situation. ''I love female.''16 The most promising time for conversation was between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. -- after two double vodkas, but before the sixth.17
 [Impossible] was given his first shotgun at the age of 10.18 An empty bottle didn't stand any more of a chance outside than a full one would have had within.

Difficult Writer Found Dead in Spain
 [Difficult Writer], a dramatist and novelist, died in Malaga, Spain, on May 4.20 Cyril Connolly visited her there shortly before his death, and spent an afternoon rummaging through her papers. ''You certainly were a sexpot in your day,'' he concluded.21
 [Difficult] was a little woman with a dollish face and basset-hound eyes, in whose mouth butter hardly ever melted.22 [Difficult] enjoyed love affairs with King Farouk of Egypt, the painters Felix Topolski and Michael Wishart. The cast also included a metropolitan policeman -- ''sex is a great leveler,'' she reflected.23 Young [Difficult] was educated at the Girls' High School in Brooklyn and Cornell University, where she fell in love with Louis Gottschalk, an assistant teacher in ancient history, whom she married in 1920.24 Country neighbors of the [Difficults] used to complain of Mrs. [Difficult's] erratic behavior, especially of her distressing tendency to ''lash out with her walking stick at those who got in her way.''25 Visits to other people's houses were invariably disastrous. ''Do come back when you're less cross,'' suggested one hostess.26
 In 1924 Robert Graves came across [Difficult's] poem ''The Quids'' in an obscure American literary magazine. Graves wrote to express his appreciation. Some trans-Atlantic correspondence ensued; and at the end of 1925 [Difficult] was invited to accompany him to Egypt, where he had taken a chair in English literature. From the moment of her arrival the newcomer dominated the poet's household. For a while even his relations with his wife improved. ''It is extremely unlikely that Nancy, [Difficult] and I will ever disband,'' Graves told Siegfried Sassoon in March 1925. Yet by May 1927 he and [Difficult] had moved to a flat at St. Peter's Square, Hammersmith, while Nancy and the children were installed nearby on a barge on the Thames. In 1929 she declared that ''three-life'' had become ''four-life'' -- her way of indicating that an Irish poet called Geoffrey Phibbs, who had been discriminating enough to praise her poetry, had been summoned to the menage in Hammersmith. Yet Phibbs still showed some disposition toward matrimonial loyalty.27 [Difficult], entirely without expert help, perforce relied on trial and error to learn the arcane arts of animal husbandry -- castration, dehorning, branding, calving and rearing.28
 In 1938 [Difficult's] ''Collected Poems'' were published, to a stunning display of critical indifference. In January 1939, however, a poetaster called Schuyler Jackson reviewed the poems in Time. Jackson's opinion that the work was ''the book of books of the mid-20th century'' seemed to [Difficult] to betray an uncommon insight. Plans were now laid for an American visit. It was unfortunate that Jackson was married, but after [Difficult] had subjected Katherine Jackson to a series of ''talks,'' this difficulty was removed. Mrs. Jackson, who had initially professed a high regard for her interrogator, now cracked up, became violent and was removed to an asylum.29
 During the honeymoon she chanted ''Until Death Us Do Part'' at her husband through clenched teeth. 30

HEADLINE: For General Assembly

 BODY:
The next session of the General Assembly will pass a two-year budget and debate solutions for Connecticut's soaring electric prices, traffic congestion and the educational disparities among cities and suburbs, as well as consider extending health insurance to the uninsured. The state needs creative, intelligent legislators to handle these issues and other challenges that may face the state over the next term. Here are our endorsements in some of the most competitive races for the House and Senate. 

Senate Races
 21st Senate District (Monroe, parts of Stratford, Seymour, Shelton) Vying to take the place of Senator George Gunther, who is retiring after more than 40 years, are Christopher Jones, a Democrat who runs a hardwood floor business, and Dan Debicella, a Republican who is director of strategy for Pepsi. Mr. Jones thinks priorities for the state should be improving state transportation and finding a way to cover the uninsured, and believes the state should use the budget surplus to increase the property tax credit on the state income tax. He is an Army veteran and grew up in Shelton. Proudly blue collar, Mr. Jones is connected to his community through a myriad of volunteer activities. We endorse Christopher Jones. 
22nd Senate District (Bridgeport, part of Monroe and Trumbull) In a rematch of the race two years ago, the Democratic incumbent, Bill Finch, a three-term senator who served nearly 10 years on Bridgeport's City Council, is running against a Republican lawyer, Robert Russo. In the last several years the Republican minority has grown smaller and smaller in the General Assembly, a change that has often deprived the legislature of balance and the public of choice. More Republican candidates like Mr. Russo would go a long way toward reversing that trend. He is smart, thoughtful, and a fourth-generation Bridgeport resident who is close to the district and passionate about improving his hometown. Mr. Russo demands the government accountability necessary to improve both the city and the state. He wants the state to aggressively audit how its money is spent to reduce mismanagement, perhaps by appointing a state inspector general for that purpose. Voters should send him to Hartford. 
 14th Senate District (Milford, Orange, part of West Haven) The Democratic incumbent, Gayle Slossberg, who is completing her first term, is running against a Republican challenger, Barbara Lisman. Senator Slossberg has worked hard on veterans issues during her freshman term, and proved to be a creative thinker, particularly concerning economic development. She is passionate about improving the state's economy and seems like exactly the kind of new blood the General Assembly needs most. We endorse Senator Slossberg.

House Races
 104th House District (part of Ansonia and Derby) The incumbent, Representative Linda Gentile, a Democrat completing her first term, is running against J. R. Romano, who is political director for the Republican party. This is a rematch of the race of two years ago. This time, voters should choose Mr. Romano to represent them in the General Assembly. He has good ideas and is refreshingly honest about what the state's priorities should be. He believes that before the state pays for universal health insurance it should ensure that everyone has access to medical care, possibly through community health clinics, since lack of access to such clinics drives up costs. He favors eliminating the property tax on cars and believes that the state should distribute school aid more fairly. Mr. Romano is bright and would be a fine addition to the legislature.
 132nd House District (part of Fairfield) The Incumbent Democrat, Representative Thomas Drew, who is completing his first term, is running against the Republican Chris DeSanctis, who is a professor of government at Sacred Heart University. Mr. Drew seems to have a deeper understanding of both state and local issues. He has worked to improve transportation and the environment. He helped spearhead an innovative pilot project to reduce beach erosion. We endorse his re-election. 
 136th House District (part of Westport) The Democratic incumbent, Joe Mioli, is being challenged by Bill Harris, a magazine publisher. We appreciate the fact that intelligent candidates like Mr. Harris are willing to invest the time and effort into making a run for office at a time when the Republican party needs resuscitation. But Mr. Mioli, who is completing his first term in office, gets our endorsement. Mr. Mioli says his story is an ordinary one -- he came here as a penniless 21-year-old and built a good life running a pizza restaurant in Westport. What is not ordinary is his common sense. He wants to help make the state competitive and brings to that task his years of perspective as a small-business owner. He sees traffic congestion as a problem that is maddening drivers and hurting the state's economy. Mr. Mioli also wants to help make the state accountable for the manner in which it spends tax money. The Times endorses Joe Mioli.

HEADLINE: Escape From Japan

BYLINE: By SHERIDAN PRASSO

 BODY:
AT the Terminal 8 food court of Kennedy International Airport, over a breakfast of Coca-Cola and greasy Chinese noodles, Miho Mimura slipped her hand into her new American boyfriend's and the tears started to flow. ''I'm sad, I don't want to go back to Japan,'' she said. 
 She looked tired, her complexion worsened by the fierce fluorescent lights. It was the morning after her 23rd birthday, and she and her boyfriend had stayed out celebrating until the wee hours.
''Today I expect cry, so no makeup,'' Ms. Mimura said in her imperfect English, rubbing her eyes. The emotion was understandable. Her three months in New York had changed her forever. 
 Ms. Mimura had come with a broken heart, after splitting with a Japanese boyfriend. To pay for her plane ticket, she took a second job in a bar in Tokyo, supplementing her $10-an-hour wage as a clerk in a clothing shop. 
 She came to New York to heal. She came to dance, particularly the hip-hop moves she had practiced in Japan. And she came to New York, like thousands of other young Japanese, to find herself. 
 In the East Village on any given weekend night, throngs of such Japanese crowd the restaurants known as izakaya that have sprung up on and around St. Marks Place, in an enclave sometimes called Little Tokyo. With red paper lanterns and cacophonous dins, the restaurants serve delectables like raw liver sashimi and grilled rice balls, to tables of expatriates known in Japan as ''freeters'' (a combination of free and the German word for worker, arbeiter), or ''NEETs'' (Not in Education, Employment or Training). 
 As a Japanese version of slackers, such young people are often derided at home as selfish for drifting through part-time jobs or trying to develop talents in the arts -- photography, music, painting, dance -- rather than contributing to society by joining a corporation or marrying and having babies. The pressure can be intense. 
 Many escape to New York, staying from three months to three years. ''In New York they feel they don't get any pressure, that New York gives them freedom,'' said the Japanese-born owner of the Sunrise Mart, a Japanese market in Little Tokyo. 
 The influx is at least a decade old, but unlike in the mid-1990's when men and women freeters came in equal numbers, now it is largely a female wave -- a result of the recovering economy in Japan that has made it slightly easier for young men to find corporate jobs upon graduation.
 Some of the youths are financed by their parents. Others say they wait tables, even when lacking work permits, in Japanese restaurants in New York where little English is required, or take cash jobs like posing nude for drawing classes in Chelsea art studios. 
 ''Three months ago, I asked my parents to send me money, and they said, 'This is the last money!' '' said Misaki Ishihara, 23, an aspiring makeup artist from central Japan, near Kobe, who has been in New York for two years. ''My parents are so conservative, they can't believe I'm here alone. They want me to be married to a Japanese man, an established man, make some kids and live in the same house with them. I can't even believe I am from that family. I am so different!'' 
 Ms. Ishihara's New York sojourn has included learning to surf on the Jersey Shore, studying English and establishing credentials for her career. ''I want to go back to Japan eventually, but now is not the time,'' she said. Her dwindling cash supply notwithstanding, her favorite pastimes are, she said, shopping, clubbing with hipsters on the Lower East Side and partying.
 Peter Pachter, who runs the American Language Communication Center in the Hotel Pennsylvania on Seventh Avenue near Penn Station, has watched the ranks of his Japanese students increase 14 percent, to about 500 in the last two years.
 ''There's a feeling that they kind of blossom here; they finally get a chance to express themselves,'' he said. 
 A number of Japanese freeters have become role models in Tokyo by finding success in New York; their stories make their way home via the weekly radio show ''Good Day New York,'' which broadcasts ''live from the Big Apple'' to 12 million Japanese from a studio on Fifth Avenue, and the ''D.J. Kaori Show,'' which reaches listeners all over Japan. 
 D.J. Kaori, the host, began spinning records at the restaurant Match in SoHo in the mid-90's. After being discovered by Funkmaster Flex of Hot 97, she graduated to D.J. jobs for celebrity parties. That translated into a recording contract for one -- and now eight -- CD mixes in Japan. 
 ''It was so hard in Japan to have the confidence to say, 'I can be what I want to be, I can do what I want to do,' '' Kaori, now in her 30's, said in a mellifluous voice. ''New York is very free. I thought, 'If I want to do this, I can do it. In Japan you have to follow the rails.''
 In Tokyo bookstores, guides like ''Finding Yourself in New York,'' and ''The 'I Love New York' Book of Dreams'' fuel the fantasies of those would follow in Kaori's footsteps. In an indication that a phenomenon has truly taken off, there's a contrarian title, ''Even If You Live in New York, You Won't Be Happy.''
 New York now has the largest number of Japanese living in any city outside Japan: 59,295, according to last year's Japanese Foreign Ministry data. But the Miho Mimuras don't register in those statistics. Like the majority of the nearly 475,000 Japanese who landed at Kennedy and Newark airports last year, she was officially a tourist. In her allotted 90 days in the United States, she took more than 850 photos -- ''my memory souvenir!'' -- of the Statue of Liberty, of Picassos at the Metropolitan Museum of Art when the guards weren't looking, and of Harlem, Radio City Music Hall and all the other places on a Japanese girl's must-see list. 
 She had a favorite East Village restaurant. She marveled over $5 T-shirts at H & M. ''Very cheap!'' she exclaimed. She stood in front of store windows imitating the mannequins. She took classes almost every night, mostly at Broadway Dance Center on West 57th Street, a studio heavily populated with young Japanese women. She saw ''Stomp'' because the 13-member cast includes a Japanese woman who, like Ms. Mimura, came to New York to pursue a dream of being a dancer. 
 On her very first Saturday night in the city last March, at a clandestine Japanese lounge operating without a liquor license in Midtown, Ms. Mimura ordered a drink more appropriate to the girl she still was than the woman she aspired to be: milk and Malibu rum. She had arranged to meet a fellow student from her first hip-hop class who went by the nickname Smiles, and a friend of his. Before their arrival, Ms. Mimura confided, ''I want American boyfriend.'' 
 She spent those first weeks struggling to learn her way around the city. She found it difficult to navigate the subway or to find Internet access. For a month, she slept on the couch in the Brooklyn apartment of her best friend from childhood, a design student at LaGuardia Community College. The two women spent hours in deep conversation. 
 Ms. Mimura wrote in her diary about her ex-boyfriend and why he had abandoned her. In one entry, which she allowed a reporter to read with the help of a translator, she confided that she had been needy and insecure around the boyfriend. Six months after the breakup, it was still hard to let go. She phoned him from New York and they talked about why their romance had ended. ''I still need him,'' Ms. Mimura said.
 One night, Ms. Mimura went to the East Village club Sin Sin, at a monthly party called ''Soulgasm,'' where a well-known dancer, Henry Link of Elite Force Crew (who has danced for Michael Jackson and Mariah Carey), often shows up. The party is popular with young Japanese women interested in hip-hop culture. 
 About 1 a.m. Mr. Link appeared, dressed in a T-shirt and track pants, and soon a circle formed around him as he danced. From time to time challengers stepped into the circle to battle, using their own dance moves, with crowd reaction measuring their success. 
 Ms. Mimura bounced with anticipation. In Japan, she never would have tried such a thing, but when an opening came she handed her beer to a bystander and plunged into the circle. Mr. Link stood back in admiration, and spectators nodded and clapped. 
 ''At Sin Sin I wasn't nervous, just not thinking about it,'' she said later. ''I felt really happy -- everybody cheering. I felt so good!'' 
 A dancer from the Bronx named Mark stood on the edge of the circle watching Ms. Mimura's impressive moves. He walked her to the subway after the club closed at 4 a.m. She thought he was ''very kindness,'' she said later, and agreed to dinner and a movie the next Saturday night.
 But Mark showed up two hours late, and when Ms. Mimura sought an explanation he babbled at her so quickly that she didn't understand. It was a stilted evening, hampered by language difficulties and hurt feelings. But still Ms. Mimura was eager to see him the next week at the House Dance Conference, another monthly event at a club. 
 When she did, however, the initial spark was gone. Smiles, her first American friend, was also there. A 22-year-old student of graphic design at New Jersey City University, he is partial to tank tops that show off his biceps. At the club, he took a proprietary interest in Ms. Mimura's welfare, making sure she got a prime spot on the edge of the challenge floor to watch the action.
 Slowly, Ms. Mimura was gaining confidence about living in New York, discovering an inner strength. She signed up to go to a national dance contest in Boston, where she made it to the semifinals. Her new friend, Smiles, wished her ''Ganbatte!'' a combination of ''Good luck'' and ''Knock 'em dead'' in Japanese. 
 But she didn't win. She blamed too much technique and not enough feeling for her loss. She needed to let the freedom of New York and the let-it-all-hang-out attitude of Americans into her heart while dancing, she said. ''Japanese dancers copy, not create,'' she said, ''and I'm more like typical Japanese dancer.'' She resolved to be more American. 
 Shortly before she was scheduled to return home, over dinner on St. Marks Place, Ms. Mimura declared that New York had changed her. ''I wasn't strong at all when I came here,'' she said. ''In Japan, I had people to rely on, but in New York I didn't have any people. I have to rely myself, so I became stronger. In Japan, I am a little bit shy. But in New York, people have freedom, and that freedom is very good for me.''
 She said that when she returned home she would pursue her dream of becoming a dancer. She had been promised a promotion if she returned to her job at the clothing store in Tokyo, but Ms. Mimura resolved to take a less demanding job to leave time for dance. Indeed, since returning to Japan in June, she has kept that promise to herself and is working in a mobile-phone shop, while entering dance contests -- three so far. 
 It was a mild summer morning when she arrived at Kennedy for her flight home. She had bought a second suitcase for all her purchases -- 30 pairs of Tommy Hilfiger socks for friends back home; a crystal statue for her ex-boyfriend's mother; a stuffed bear for a grandmother; jewelry for her mother and sister; and for herself, dancing shoes and piles of new clothes. 
 Smiles was with her. At some point in the previous days, it seemed clear, he had become her boyfriend. He helped load her suitcases onto the baggage scale. They headed to the food court.
 Alternately crying, then finding something to laugh about, then crying again, Ms. Mimura took out her camera.
 She wanted to remember the moment.

HEADLINE: The Vegetable-Industrial Complex

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POLLAN. 
Michael Pollan, a contributing writer for the magazine, is the author most recently of ''The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals.''

 BODY:
Soon after the news broke last month that nearly 200 Americans in 26 states had been sickened by eating packaged spinach contaminated with E. coli, I received a rather coldblooded e-mail message from a friend in the food business. ''I have instructed my broker to purchase a million shares of RadSafe,'' he wrote, explaining that RadSafe is a leading manufacturer of food-irradiation technology. It turned out my friend was joking, but even so, his reasoning was impeccable. If bagged salad greens are vulnerable to bacterial contamination on such a scale, industry and government would very soon come looking for a technological fix; any day now, calls to irradiate the entire food supply will be on a great many official lips. That's exactly what happened a few years ago when we learned that E. coli from cattle feces was winding up in American hamburgers. Rather than clean up the kill floor and the feedlot diet, some meat processors simply started nuking the meat -- sterilizing the manure, in other words, rather than removing it from our food. Why? Because it's easier to find a technological fix than to address the root cause of such a problem. This has always been the genius of industrial capitalism -- to take its failings and turn them into exciting new business opportunities. 
We can also expect to hear calls for more regulation and inspection of the produce industry. Already, watchdogs like the Center for Science in the Public Interest have proposed that the government impose the sort of regulatory regime it imposes on the meat industry -- something along the lines of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point system (Haccp, pronounced HASS-ip) developed in response to the E. coli contamination of beef. At the moment, vegetable growers and packers are virtually unregulated. ''Farmers can do pretty much as they please,'' Carol Tucker Foreman, director of the Food Policy Institute at the Consumer Federation of America, said recently, ''as long as they don't make anyone sick.'' 
 This sounds like an alarming lapse in governmental oversight until you realize there has never before been much reason to worry about food safety on farms. But these days, the way we farm and the way we process our food, both of which have been industrialized and centralized over the last few decades, are endangering our health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that our food supply now sickens 76 million Americans every year, putting more than 300,000 of them in the hospital, and killing 5,000. The lethal strain of E. coli known as 0157:H7, responsible for this latest outbreak of food poisoning, was unknown before 1982; it is believed to have evolved in the gut of feedlot cattle. These are animals that stand around in their manure all day long, eating a diet of grain that happens to turn a cow's rumen into an ideal habitat for E. coli 0157:H7. (The bug can't survive long in cattle living on grass.) Industrial animal agriculture produces more than a billion tons of manure every year, manure that, besides being full of nasty microbes like E. coli 0157:H7 (not to mention high concentrations of the pharmaceuticals animals must receive so they can tolerate the feedlot lifestyle), often ends up in places it shouldn't be, rather than in pastures, where it would not only be harmless but also actually do some good. To think of animal manure as pollution rather than fertility is a relatively new (and industrial) idea.
 Wendell Berry once wrote that when we took animals off farms and put them onto feedlots, we had, in effect, taken an old solution -- the one where crops feed animals and animals' waste feeds crops -- and neatly divided it into two new problems: a fertility problem on the farm, and a pollution problem on the feedlot. Rather than return to that elegant solution, however, industrial agriculture came up with a technological fix for the first problem -- chemical fertilizers on the farm. As yet, there is no good fix for the second problem, unless you count irradiation and Haccp plans and overcooking your burgers and, now, staying away from spinach. All of these solutions treat E. coli 0157:H7 as an unavoidable fact of life rather than what it is: a fact of industrial agriculture. 
 But if industrial farming gave us this bug, it is industrial eating that has spread it far and wide. We don't yet know exactly what happened in the case of the spinach washed and packed by Natural Selection Foods, whether it was contaminated in the field or in the processing plant or if perhaps the sealed bags made a trivial contamination worse. But we do know that a great deal of spinach from a great many fields gets mixed together in the water at that plant, giving microbes from a single field an opportunity to contaminate a vast amount of food. The plant in question washes 26 million servings of salad every week. In effect, we're washing the whole nation's salad in one big sink. 
 It's conceivable the same problem could occur in your own kitchen sink or on a single farm. Food poisoning has always been with us, but not until we started processing all our food in such a small number of ''kitchens'' did the potential for nationwide outbreaks exist. 
 Surely this points to one of the great advantages of a decentralized food system: when things go wrong, as they sooner or later will, fewer people are affected and, just as important, the problem can be more easily traced to its source and contained. A long and complicated food chain, in which food from all over the countryside is gathered together in one place to be processed and then distributed all over the country to be eaten, can be impressively efficient, but by its very nature it is a food chain devilishly hard to follow and to fix. 
 Fortunately, this is not the only food chain we have. The week of the E. coli outbreak, washed spinach was on sale at my local farmers' market, and at the Blue Heron Farms stand, where I usually buy my greens, the spinach appeared to be moving briskly. I tasted a leaf and wondered why I didn't think twice about it. I guess it's because I've just always trusted these guys; I buy from them every week. The spinach was probably cut and washed that morning or the night before -- it hasn't been sitting around in a bag on a truck for a week. And if there ever is any sort of problem, I know exactly who is responsible. Whatever the risk, and I'm sure there is some, it seems manageable. 
 These days, when people make the case for buying local food, they often talk about things like keeping farmers in our communities and eating fresh food in season, at the peak of its flavor. We like what's going on at the farmers' market -- how country meets city, how children learn that a carrot is not a glossy orange bullet that comes in a bag but is actually a root; how we get to taste unfamiliar flavors and even, in some sense, reconnect through these foods and their growers to the natural world. Stack all this up against the convenience and price of supermarket food, though, and it can sound a little. . .sentimental. 
 But there's nothing sentimental about local food -- indeed, the reasons to support local food economies could not be any more hardheaded or pragmatic. Our highly centralized food economy is a dangerously precarious system, vulnerable to accidental -- and deliberate -- contamination. This is something the government understands better than most of us eaters. When Tommy Thompson retired from the Department of Health and Human Services in 2004, he said something chilling at his farewell news conference: ''For the life of me, I cannot understand why the terrorists have not attacked our food supply, because it is so easy to do.'' The reason it is so easy to do was laid out in a 2003 G.A.O. report to Congress on bioterrorism. ''The high concentration of our livestock industry and the centralized nature of our food-processing industry'' make them ''vulnerable to terrorist attack.'' Today 80 percent of America's beef is slaughtered by four companies, 75 percent of the precut salads are processed by two and 30 percent of the milk by just one company. Keeping local food economies healthy -- and at the moment they are thriving -- is a matter not of sentiment but of critical importance to the national security and the public health, as well as to reducing our dependence on foreign sources of energy. 
 Yet perhaps the gravest threat now to local food economies -- to the farmer selling me my spinach, to the rancher who sells me my grass-fed beef -- is, of all things, the government's own well-intentioned efforts to clean up the industrial food supply. Already, hundreds of regional meat-processing plants -- the ones that local meat producers depend on -- are closing because they can't afford to comply with the regulatory requirements the U.S.D.A. rightly imposes on giant slaughterhouses that process 400 head of cattle an hour. The industry insists that all regulations be ''scale neutral,'' so if the U.S.D.A. demands that huge plants have, say, a bathroom, a shower and an office for the exclusive use of its inspectors, then a small processing plant that slaughters local farmers' livestock will have to install these facilities, too. This is one of the principal reasons that meat at the farmers' market is more expensive than meat at the supermarket: farmers are seldom allowed to process their own meat, and small processing plants have become very expensive to operate, when the U.S.D.A. is willing to let them operate at all. From the U.S.D.A.'s perspective, it is much more efficient to put their inspectors in a plant where they can inspect 400 cows an hour rather than in a local plant where they can inspect maybe one. 
 So what happens to the spinach grower at my farmers' market when the F.D.A. starts demanding a Haccp plan -- daily testing of the irrigation water, say, or some newfangled veggie-irradiation technology? When we start requiring that all farms be federally inspected? Heavy burdens of regulation always fall heaviest on the smallest operations and invariably wind up benefiting the biggest players in an industry, the ones who can spread the costs over a larger output of goods. A result is that regulating food safety tends to accelerate the sort of industrialization that made food safety a problem in the first place. We end up putting our faith in RadSafe rather than in Blue Heron Farms -- in technologies rather than relationships.
 It's easy to imagine the F.D.A. announcing a new rule banning animals from farms that produce plant crops. In light of the threat from E. coli, such a rule would make a certain kind of sense. But it is an industrial, not an ecological, sense. For the practice of keeping animals on farms used to be, as Wendell Berry pointed out, a solution; only when cows moved onto feedlots did it become a problem. Local farmers and local food economies represent much the same sort of pre-problem solution -- elegant, low-tech and redundant. But the logic of industry, apparently ineluctable, has other ideas, ideas that not only leave our centralized food system undisturbed but also imperil its most promising, and safer, alternatives.

HEADLINE: In Relaxed Montevideo, the Past Lives On in Style

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
FOR many tourists, there are only two reasons to visit Uruguay: beachy, clubby Punta del Este and quaint, historic Colonia del Sacramento. Montevideo, the nation's relaxed capital on the banks of the Rio de la Plata, offers an eclectic mix of architecture and culture, but is often relegated to the status of stopover.
 Perhaps that is because the city doesn't exactly reach out to grab you. Like Uruguayans, it sits back and reveals itself little by little. There is much of the old, and a small but slowly growing dose of the new.
''We have a conservative mentality, very conservative, and so we don't like change,'' says Eduardo Lopez, who has been selling coins and antiques at the Saturday flea market on Plaza Constitucion for 12 years. As an impromptu parade of soldiers in ceremonial uniforms tromps by, he adds that since the country's banking crisis in 2002, there has been little money for investing in the future. The economy is growing again, but so far that growth hasn't produced many new facilities for travelers. 
 The past lives on in style, though. Back in 1870, the average living standards there were higher than in the United States, and it shows. Take a walk through the Old City, where almost every street has a view of the water, sometimes at both ends, and you'll discover a bounty of architectural treasures from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
 A good place to start is the National History Museum, housed in 10 old residences. The main museum is in the former home of Fructuoso Rivera, the country's first president, at the intersection of Rincon and Misiones; the collection traces the country's history from before the European colonization to the middle of the 20th century. 
 The corner is marked by an upturned cannon, but you also can't miss the building's octagonal cupola. Another of the houses, in slightly worse repair, was occupied by Giuseppe Garibaldi (known locally as Jose) when he led the Uruguayan fleet in the 1840's.
 A few blocks away stands the gorgeous and idiosyncratic Palacio Taranco, at the corner of 25th of May and 1st of May Streets. It's a sprawling castle from 1910, decked out with stone urns and Roman arches, that used to be a family residence but now houses the Museum of Decorative Arts, with a collection of European antiques that ranges from paintings to porcelain. 
 The Old City isn't just a collection of architectural heirlooms, though. Some of the country's hippest young designers have installed their boutiques on its narrow streets. At 280 25th of May Street, a metal door with pink and red portholes stands out like the proverbial aching digit. Inside is a sleek store selling the creations of Ana Livni and Fernando Escuder, avant-garde designs using soft materials and occasional shots of bright color.
 ''Design here is growing -- very slowly, but it's growing,'' says Stefania Reta, a design student who works there. She also says that there's a streak of patriotism among the younger generation.
 ''They all studied here,'' she says of the local designers. ''The idea is always to make it grow here, to apply our knowledge here.''
 If you're looking for more traditional knits and leather goods, the nearby Mercado del Puerto (Port Market) is worth a stop. For the locals, though, it's more of a lunch spot; dozens sit at long counters, facing open grills covered with fat cuts of beef, sausages and enormous red peppers.
 Alternatively, you can head up Sarandi, a pedestrianized street with outdoor sculpture on show, toward the Plaza Independencia. On the way, you're likely to see a horse or two dragging a cartful of miscellaneous junk, or perhaps some sarcastic graffiti. One wall, for example, reads ''No more multinationals!'' while another nearby says, simply, ''Free money!''
 At the eastern end of the Plaza Independencia looms a uniquely peculiar building. The Palacio Salvo, finished in 1928, looks like a multistage rocket as imagined by Jules Verne. Some people say that once, atop its 26 stories, a lighthouse was able to signal a similar skyscraper designed by the same architect, Mario Palanti, across the gaping river in Buenos Aires. It seems unlikely, though, given the distance of nearly 140 miles between the two cities.
 The surrounding downtown area is dotted with restaurants serving the unofficial national dish, the chivito, perhaps the world's most extravagant steak sandwich. One is the Manchester, a vintage diner at the corner of 18th of July and Convencion whose logo, perplexingly, includes London's Big Ben. Its chivito consists of a tender fillet on homestyle bread with cheese, bacon, tomato, lettuce, roasted red peppers, palm hearts, hard-boiled egg and olives on top -- for 95 pesos ($3.80, at 25 pesos to the dollar).
 On Sundays, a short walk up 18th of July brings you to one of the wildest street markets you'll ever see, the Tristan Narvaja Fair. The fair takes places on Tristan Narvaja Street, but its stalls, selling everything from live tarantulas to tiny clay ocarinas, spill out onto all the surrounding byways.
 The street itself is lined with used book and antiques stores, which quickly fill up when it rains. So does La Tortuguita, a noisy neighborhood joint where the chivitos are served al plato, on a plate with bread on the side. The steak reclines on a bed of fries, lettuce and tomato, and is topped with boiled potatoes, carrots and peas, roasted red peppers, cheese, bacon, olives, mayonnaise and a fried egg. If you don't look as if you're eating it correctly -- that is, slicing through the pile to get a taste of everything on your fork -- a friendly waiter will intervene.
 If the you-could-hardly-call-it-bustle of Montevideo's center gets to be too much, head for the banks of the river, which locals call the sea. The entire city is rimmed by the Rambla, a road that is itself lined with rocky and sandy beaches. There are glassed-in cafes looking out onto the river, and even a few perched on the beach itself like CHE Montevideo, near the corner of 21st of September.
 Over a cappuccino at CHE, Virginia, an architect who did not want her last name used, says that Montevideo is mostly a destination for Argentines, Brazilians and Chileans, with few tourists from farther afield.
 ''The Ministry of Tourism focuses on Punta del Este and not Montevideo -- and it's even less with this government,'' she says. ''There's more cultural activity here, but the tourists don't look for it so much. There are shows, there are galleries, there's the Contemporary Art Foundation,'' which is a self-supporting group made up of young artists working in various media. 
 Indeed, if there is one building that is particularly well cared for, it's the city's cultural temple, the Teatro Solis. The theater, which dates from 1856, was renovated in 1998 and remains pristine. 
 As part of the renovation, a single set of staircases was built to connect all the floors, replacing the old system that had separated the expensive seats from the upper decks at the behest of the theater's original, class-conscious backers. The hall's classic, lyre-shaped space lends a surprisingly intimate feel to its 1,250 seats.
 When the sun sets, well-to-do Montevideans head to Pocitos and Punta Carretas, on a peninsula a few minutes' taxi ride from the city center. In these mostly residential neighborhoods, some of the capital's best restaurants occupy gracious old houses. 
 Between its dark wood floors and ceilings, Da Pentella mixes fresh pasta and nightly specials like roast suckling pig and stuffed rabbit. Not far away, La Perdiz, a buzzing local favorite, offers fresh seafood like grilled chipirones (baby squid) in garlic and oil, as well as the usual meats, in portions that are big enough to share. 
 Afterward, it's back to the Old City, where the streets around Bartolome Mitre and Sarandi quickly fill up with outdoor seating for the city's busiest bars.
 For something a bit quieter, you can retreat to Carrasco, a leafy enclave of the moneyed classes on the east side of Montevideo that boasts a remarkable variety of birdlife. Carrasco even has its own English-style country hotel in the Belmont House, with the requisite antiques as well as portraits by Juan Manuel Blanes, one of Uruguay's best-known 19th-century painters.
 It's worth walking down to the Rambla, past the Argentine ambassador's splendid residence, to see the monstrous hulk of the Hotel Casino Carrasco. Built in 1921, the graying colossus is undergoing a much-needed renovation. 
 Back inland a block or two are several of Carrasco's finer restaurants, notably Baltasar, which opened in 2005. ''The majority of the clientele are families from here, but some also come from Pocitos and Punta Carretas,'' says Fernando de Castro, Baltasar's owner. 
 The trip to Carrasco from the center takes about 20 minutes by car, and longer by bus. But it's clearly not just geography that separates Carrasco from the modest living in the rest of Montevideo.
 That split between the classes leaves Eduardo Lopez, the coin seller, feeling worried. ''There's a high unemployment rate,'' he says. ''The middle class is disappearing. You're poor or you're rich.''
 But Virginia, the architect, who seems pretty middle class, says she isn't planning to leave. ''It doesn't seem like life's better in other countries,'' she says, adding that she spent a couple of months working in Coral Gables, Fla. ''There are different things, but not better ones.''

HEADLINE: Little Wiggle Room for XXL Passengers 

BYLINE: By CHARLES PASSY

 BODY:
WHEN Angela Hult caught an afternoon flight from Seattle to Portland, Ore., a few weeks ago, she was looking forward to having some time and space to herself after a long day of meetings. ''You just want to slump in your chair and relax,'' recalled Ms. Hult, an executive with a health-care company. ''Then, all of a sudden, it's 'Wow!' ''
 The rude awakening was courtesy of her seatmate -- a man of considerable girth who had to lift the armrest to squeeze into the two-seat row. Since the flight was full, Ms. Hult had no choice but to surrender half her seat and position her frame sideways to give herself breathing room.
''I thought, 'Oh boy, am I ever glad this is a short flight,'' Ms. Hult added. 
 These days, travelers are increasingly finding themselves in such tight spots. The culprit is not just the ever-expanding waistlines of Americans. (The average weight of American men has risen to 191 pounds from 166 over the last four decades, according to the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control.) It's also the fact that the major American carriers are flying closer to capacity -- nearly 86 percent full in July, according to the International Air Transport Association.
 So, when a heavier passenger needs an extra seat, there may not be one available. Hence, the big squeeze.
 Adding to the problem is that some airlines don't have rigidly enforced or widely publicized rules when it comes to what Southwest Airlines delicately refers to as ''customers of size,'' often leaving it to those who pack some extra pounds and those who don't to work it out among themselves. Call it the war of the armrests. 
 ''The people who really get hurt are the people sitting next to these folks,'' said Ed Perkins, a contributing editor to smartertravel.com and the founding editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter.
 Then again, the plus-size passenger isn't exactly comfortable, either. But the dilemma for these travelers is whether or not to pay for an extra seat -- or hope that the plane will have enough empty ones available to give them a seat free.
 Many airlines don't push the issue of buying a second seat. For example, a Northwest Airlines spokesman, Roman Blahoski, said that ''when availability permits, Northwest will try to accommodate customers requiring additional space,'' but he wouldn't elaborate on what happens when such space isn't available.
 One noteworthy exception is Southwest: It has a detailed set of rules spelled out on its Web site: passengers needing spillover space must purchase a second seat; if the flight ends up having extra space, the cost of that ticket will be refunded. And lest there be any doubt as to who qualifies as a ''customer of size,'' the carrier's guidelines (under Southwest Policies in the Travel Center section) put it bluntly:
 ''Customers who are unable to lower the armrests (the definitive boundary between seats) and/or who compromise any portion of adjacent seating should proactively book the number of seats needed.''
 Why such a strict policy? A Southwest spokeswoman, Beth Harbin, said it's to be fair, noting that the complaints are mainly from passengers who had someone spill over in their seats. ''You have to do something to address those concerns,'' she said. 
 Such forthrightness might have spared Philip Shafer, a lawyer from Ohio, the discomfort he endured when he flew on Delta from New Orleans to Cincinnati in 2001, seated next to a man who, by Mr. Shafer's estimates, ''was pushing 450 pounds.'' But with no additional space on the plane, Mr. Shafer surrendered at least half his seat. ''From my knee to my shoulder, this guy was pressed up against me,'' he recalled.
 But Mr. Shafer did decide to push the issue after the flight, suing Delta for what he said was a breach of its contract. That is, he didn't get what he paid for -- a full seat.
 The matter was eventually settled out of court, but Mr. Shafer says the issue was never money. Instead, it was about forcing airlines to establish policies that recognize the rights of standard-size passengers. ''Southwest is the only airline that gets it,'' he said. 
 (A Delta spokeswoman, Betsy Talton, said she was not familiar with the case, but she said that Delta works with passengers on such seating issues on a ''case-by-case basis,'' adding that ''we try to make sure everyone has a comfortable flight.'')
 Making sure that everyone is comfortable might mean giving some heavy passengers an extra seat. And that's a seat that some advocates for the obese say should be provided without extra cost. Their argument is that airlines must make accommodations for the disabled, and obesity, particularly morbid obesity -- sometimes defined as 100 pounds over normal body weight -- could well qualify as a disability.
 ''It's not a lifestyle choice or a social choice,'' said Joseph Nadglowski Jr., president of the Obesity Action Coalition, a Florida-based lobbying group. Mr. Nadglowski added that airlines ''make accommodations for others with other health conditions,'' so why not the same for the obese?
 The airlines maintain that the law is on their side: While the Americans with Disabilities Act may offer some protection to the obese, it doesn't apply to airlines, which are covered by the Air Carrier Access Act. And as Southwest points out on its Web site, that law says carriers ''are not required to furnish more than one seat per ticket.''
 Not that some haven't tried to challenge such thinking. In a noteworthy California case, Cynthia Luther, who acknowledged weighing ''more than the average woman,'' sued Southwest for requiring that she pay for a second seat. But a state judge dismissed the lawsuit, saying the airline's actions weren't discriminatory.
 Either way, heavier travelers often note that for all the problems they may cause, they're not necessarily inconveniencing passengers any more than are taller travelers, who are likely to push seats back as far as possible or shift their legs into the aisles. Why not single them out?
 The reason, says C. L. Talmadge, a novelist and syndicated columnist who is an overweight traveler, is simple: ''Fat people are the easiest target in the world.''
 She may have a point: Whenever the issue of plus-size fliers arises, some go so far as to suggest that passengers be weighed -- not only because of the seating issue, but also because a heavier plane uses more fuel -- an expense that is shared by all. Why not penalize those most responsible? 
 To quote one rant on a message board, yellowworld.org: ''Fat people are a burden on society.''
 Still, there could be a certain logic to the pay-per-pound idea: Mr. Perkins, the travel editor, points out that in the early days of air travel, passengers were weighed to make sure that planes weren't carrying more than they could handle. But modern aircraft are capable of transporting heavier loads, and airlines don't seem eager to alienate passengers by putting them on a scale. 
 ''It's not something we ever discussed,'' said a Continental Airlines spokesman, David Messing.
 Some say the solution is to make seats wider than the standard 17 to 18 inches. But to do so, carriers would need to raise prices. And Mr. Perkins maintains that passengers have already shown they'll contend with just about anything -- no in-flight meals, tighter restrictions on checked baggage -- for the sake of paying as little as possible.
 ''A lot of the market says we don't care how narrow the seats are so long as we get those low prices,'' said Mr. Perkins. 
 He added that a possible solution might be for carriers to offer a roomier grade of economy seats, priced higher than coach but cheaper than first class. United Airlines has done just that with its Economy Plus program, though the carrier acknowledges that seats offer more legroom but not more width.
 Which is not to say there aren't other ways to broker peace in the war of the armrests. Carey O'Donnell, a publicist in West Palm Beach, Fla., sat next to a heavy passenger on a flight last year from New York to Florida. A slim but tall woman, Ms. O'Donnell agreed to lift the armrest up, as long as her seatmate would lean her chair fully back so ''we weren't elbow-to-elbow.''
 ''She was really appreciative of someone not glaring at her in accusatory silence and telegraphing bad attitude for the two-hour trip,'' Ms. O'Donnell said.

 BODY:
One day earlier this year I met Wang Hui at the Thinker's Cafe near Tsinghua University in Bejing, where he teaches. A small, compact man with streaks of gray in his short hair and a pleasant face that always seems ready to break into a smile, he arrived, as he would to all our subsequent meetings, on an old-fashioned bicycle, dressed in dark corduroys, a suede jacket and a black turtleneck that would not be amiss on an American campus. 
Co-editor of China's leading intellectual journal, Dushu (Reading), and the author of a four-volume history of Chinese thought, Wang, still in his mid-40's, has emerged as a central figure among a group of writers and academics known collectively as the New Left. New Left intellectuals advocate a ''Chinese alternative'' to the neoliberal market economy, one that will guarantee the welfare of the country's 800 million peasants left behind by recent reforms. And unlike much of China's dissident class, which grew out of the protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989 and consists largely of human rights and pro-democracy activists, Wang and the New Left view the Communist leadership as a likely force for change. Recent events -- the purge of party leaders on anticorruption charges late last month and continuing efforts to curb market excesses -- suggest that this view is neither utopian nor paradoxical. Though New Leftists have never directed government policy, their concerns are increasingly amplified by the central leadership. 
 In the last few years, Wang has reflected eloquently and often on what outsiders see as the central paradox of contemporary China: an authoritarian state fostering a free-market economy while espousing socialism. On this first afternoon, he barely paused for small talk before embarking on an analysis of the country's problems. He described how the Communist Party, though officially dedicated to egalitarianism, had opened its membership to rich businessmen. Many of its local officials, he said, used their arbitrary power to become successful entrepreneurs at the expense of the rural populations they were meant to serve and joined up with real estate speculators to seize collectively owned land from peasants. (According to Chinese officials, 60 percent of land acquisitions are illegal.) The result has been an alliance of elite political and commercial interests, Wang said, that recalls similar alliances in the United States and many East Asian countries. 
 As he spoke about how market reforms have widened the gap between rich and poor, between rural and urban areas, smartly dressed students browsed through a highbrow collection (Leo Strauss, Jurgen Habermas), checked their e-mail and sipped their mochas. At the privately owned Thinker's Cafe and the adjoining All Sages bookshop, Wang seemed to be famous. Students greeted him reverentially; the staff was extra attentive. Yet Wang still belongs to a minority. Recoiling from the excesses of Maoism and the failures of the old planned economy, most Chinese intellectuals, even those with no connection to the state, see the market economy as indispensable to China's modernization and revival. Zhu Xueqin, a history professor at Shanghai University who is one of China's best-known liberal intellectuals, told me that he wants more, not fewer, market reforms. For him, China's present instability is caused not by economic forces but by a politically repressive regime that has prevented the emergence of a representative democracy and a constitutional government. 
 Wang readily acknowledges that China's efforts at economic reform have not been without great benefits. He applauds the first phase, which lasted from 1978 to 1985, for improving agricultural output and the rural standard of living. It is the central government's more recent obsession with creating wealth in urban areas -- and its decision to hand over political authority to local party bosses, who often explicitly disregard central government directives -- that has led, he said, to deep inequalities within China. The embrace of a neoliberal market economy has meant the dismantling of welfare systems, a widening income gap between rich and poor and deepening environmental crises not only in China but in the United States and other developed countries. For Wang, it is the task of intellectuals to remind the state of its old, unfulfilled obligations to peasants and workers.
 Despite his invocation of socialist principles, Wang was quick to tell me that he dislikes the New Left label, even though he has used it himself. ''Intellectuals reacted against 'leftism' in the 80's, blaming it for all of China's problems,'' he said, ''and right-wing radicals use the words 'New Left' to discredit us, make us look like remnants from the Maoist days.'' Wang also doesn't care to be identified with the radical intellectuals of the 60's in America and Europe, to whom the term New Left was originally applied. Many of them, he said, had passion and slogans but very little practical politics, and not surprisingly, more than a few ended up with the neoconservatives, supporting ''fantasy projects'' like democracy in Iraq. 
 Wang prefers the term ''critical intellectual'' for himself and like-minded colleagues, some of whom are also part of China's nascent activist movement in the countryside, working to alleviate rural poverty and environmental damage. Though broadly left wing, Dushu publishes writing from across the ideological spectrum. Wang's own work draws on a broad range of Western thinkers, from the French historian Fernand Braudel to the globalization theorist Immanuel Wallerstein. ''Intellectual quality is important to me,'' Wang said. ''I don't want to run just any left-wing garbage.'' The magazine has carried abstract debates on postcolonial theory as well as, he claims, some of the most interesting analyses in China of how the government's urban-oriented reforms have damaged rural society. There are restrictions on what Dushu can publish, of course, and Wang is frank about them. As with all intellectual journals in mainland China, authors and editors at Dushu have to exercise a degree of self-censorship. Articles cannot directly criticize the leadership or deviate much from the official line on subjects that the Chinese government considers most sensitive -- Taiwan or restive Muslim and Buddhist minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet. ''I get asked in Western countries, 'How do you define your position?''' Wang said. '''Are you a dissident?' I say no. What is a dissident? It is a cold-war category. And it has no meaning now. Many of the Chinese dissidents in America can return to China. But they don't want to. They are doing well in the U.S. To people who ask me if we are dissidents, I say, we are critical intellectuals. Some government policies we support. Others, we oppose. It really depends on the content of the policy.''
 Born in Yangzhou in the southeast province of Jiangsu, Wang was just 7 and entering primary school when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966. The decade-long chaos, which traumatized older generations, seems to have left benign memories for Wang. He remembers being taken by his school to work in the villages for a week or two during the school year. ''My generation of urban intellectuals,'' he said, with a hint of pride, ''is the last to have firsthand experience of conditions in the countryside.'' 
 He counts the 20 months he spent working in factories around Yangzhou after middle school as a valuable experience. In 1977, he took the first university entrance exams to be held after the Cultural Revolution, during which many universities were either shut or would admit only peasants, workers and soldiers. ''Thousands of aspiring students,'' he reminisced, ''were competing for a single place.'' 
 When he moved from Yangzhou to Beijing to begin his doctoral studies in the mid-80's, Wang found himself part of an even more privileged class. ''Intellectuals,'' he said, ''had been targeted during Mao's time; now, post-Mao, they were the elite again.'' And by then, Wang said, they all agreed on what needed to be done: China had to abandon its ''feudal'' and socialist traditions and catch up with the capitalist West. Scarred by the Cultural Revolution, intellectuals saw socialism in China as a failure. Consequently, they had, Wang argues, no real debate on whether a Western-style consumerist society could be successfully recreated or was environmentally sustainable in China. The West, especially the United States, was idealized. 
 Wang first began to develop his own views on contemporary China while working on a dissertation about one of the most admired of modern Chinese writers, Lu Xun (1881 1936). Lu Xun, Wang explained to me, was a writer of the left, but he was very critical of left-wing writers and activists. He criticized Chinese tradition, but was also an excellent classical scholar. He welcomed the Western idea of progress, but was also skeptical of it. The paradoxes in Lu Xun helped Wang to see that Chinese modernity could not be a simple matter of abandoning the old and embracing the new -- as it had been for both Maoists and free-market capitalists.
 For Wang, the problems associated with China's uneven development were first identified by the demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Wang himself was one of the last protesters to leave the square on the morning of June 4, 1989, as the tanks of the People's Liberation Army closed in. Normally rather brisk and matter-of-fact, he grew animated as he described in fluent, if occasionally idiosyncratic, English how a ''broad social movement'' began to grow out of the distress caused by the shock therapy of market reforms. The students demanding freedom of speech and assembly were certainly the most visible. But there were, he said, many more Chinese in the cities -- workers, government officials and small businessmen -- demanding that the government control corruption and inflation, which had shot up to 30 percent after price controls on basic commodities were lifted.
 In the spring of 1989, Wang was a fellow at the prestigious Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Wang told me that he saw ''democratic potential'' in the protests and felt obliged to participate even though he had reservations about the students' lack of ''theoretical or methodological coherence.'' For Wang, the student leaders recalled the Chinese intellectuals of the early 20th century, who were never more united than when they radically rejected everything in the past. Nevertheless, after the government sought to crush dissent by declaring martial law on May 20, 1989, Wang was drawn deeper into the movement. On the night of June 3, when the tanks and armored cars charged through Beijing, killing hundreds of unarmed resisters and injuring thousands more, Wang was among those assembled in the center of Tiananmen Square. He could hear the gunfire, but some of the more radical among the students still refused to leave. 
 Wang decided to stay and to try to persuade the students not to sacrifice their lives. ''I knew,'' he said, ''that if the result was violence, it would be disastrous for the whole country.'' Wang said that his fears were proved right: violence shrank the space for political debate, and the Chinese government used the period of intellectual silence that followed to begin dismantling more aspects of the welfare state, like the state-owned enterprises, that had long offered cradle-to-grave benefits to workers.
 Eventually, the students advocating peaceful retreat prevailed and persuaded the People's Liberation Army to give them safe passage in the southeast corner of the square. Just before dawn, hundreds of students left the square through a narrow corridor, jostled and taunted by hostile soldiers. Within minutes, the students dispersed. Some of them were arrested and sentenced to long prison spells; others fled to Hong Kong and eventually to the West; many others, like Wang, disappeared for a few weeks. 
 When Wang returned to Beijing in late 1989, the authorities were waiting for him. ''That was the most difficult time for me,'' he said. He was asked repeatedly: ''What was your organization? Who were your associates?'' After interrogations lasting for many months, he was sent to the northwestern province of Shaanxi, where dozens of other young scholars from Beijing were already undergoing -- in the uniquely Chinese way -- ''re-education'' by exposure to rural conditions. 
 In Wang's case, punishment by pedagogy seems to have been more successful than Chinese authorities could have anticipated. He dates his ''real education'' to the time he spent in Shaanxi, one of the poorest regions of China. He was shocked by the obvious disparity between the coastal cities, then enjoying the first fruits of economic reform, and the provinces. He was shocked, too, by his own ignorance and that of his colleagues in the 1989 social movement. ''We had no idea that the old order in much of rural China was in deep crisis,'' he said. 
 The commune system in Shaanxi was dismantled as part of Deng Xiaoping's reforms, and land was redistributed. But the area produced nothing of much value, not even enough food. Deepening poverty led to a sharp increase in crime and social problems; violent conflicts broke out over land; men took to gambling, beating up, even selling, their wives and daughters. Wang lived in a low-lying village where his dormitory was frequently flooded while he slept. Much of his daily work consisted of writing didactic pamphlets warning peasants against gambling and crime; he also worked on the reconstruction of a primary school that had been destroyed by floodwaters. ''It was during that year,'' Wang said, ''that I realized how important a welfare system and cooperative network remained for many people in China. This is not a socialist idea. Even the imperial dynasties that ruled China kept a balance between rich and poor areas through taxes and almsgiving. 
 ''People confine China's experience to the Communist dictatorship and failures of the planned economy and think that the market will now do everything. They don't see how many things in the past worked and were popular with ordinary people, like cooperative medical insurance in rural areas, where people organized themselves to help each other. That might be useful today, since the state doesn't invest in health care in rural areas anymore.''
 Many poor people Wang met during his year in Shaanxi saw him as the educated man from Beijing who would tell the mandarins of the central government to send them some help. ''I felt burdened by this role,'' Wang said. ''I couldn't tell them that I was in no position to do anything.'' Wang returned, he told me, from his 10-month exile with a keen sense of the gap between the worlds of intellectuals and ordinary people. 
 During his time in Shaanxi, the influential Journal of Literary Review denounced his research on Lu Xun as an example of ''bourgeois liberalization.'' Nevertheless, Wang had no trouble returning to academic life. Wang doesn't like to talk much about 1989. He complains about the ''stereotype'' of China in the Western media conjured by Tiananmen. Nonetheless, our conversation about Tiananmen was unusual. While traveling through Chinese cities, I had found it hard to get people to talk about it. When Deng Xiaoping sought to bury the ghosts of Tiananmen for good by calling for speedy market reforms in 1992, he may well have calculated that the prospect of personal wealth -- and access to Western brand-name goods -- would compensate many newly enriched people for the lack of political democracy. If so, he seems to have been proved right. The largest public disturbance in China since Tiananmen occurred in August 1992, when hundreds of thousands of Chinese tried to buy shares in the newly opened stock exchange of Shenzen.
 The effort to create wealth in urban areas through export-oriented industries -- part of the ''let some get rich first'' policy announced by Deng Xiaoping and affirmed by his successors -- has given the Chinese economy an average growth rate of 10 percent and made it the fourth largest in the world. Yet China remains one of the world's poorest countries. More than 150 million people survive on a dollar a day. About 200 million of the rural population are crowding the cities and towns in search of low-paying jobs. More than four million Chinese participated in the 87,000 protests recorded in 2005, and these statistics may not fully convey the rage and discontent of Chinese living with one of the world's highest income inequalities and deteriorating health and education systems, as well as the arbitrary fees and taxes imposed by local party officials. Much of this, Wang said, could be laid at the feet of the ''right-wing radicals'' or neoliberal economists who cite Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek (advocates of unregulated markets who inspired Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in the 80's) and who argue for China's integration into the global economy without taking into account the social price of mass privatization. And it is they, Wang added, who have held favor with the ruling elite and have dominated the state-run media. 
 Only in the last decade, Wang said, have intellectuals of the New Left begun to challenge the notion that a market economy leads inevitably to democracy and prosperity. Wang, who helped found an academic journal called Xueren (The Scholar) after returning from exile in 1991, was well placed to observe those intellectuals. As they came into greater contact with Western academics and scholars, they became more aware of problems not just in European and American societies but also in post-Communist countries that were trying to bring their planned economies closer to neoliberal models. China's intention to join the World Trade Organization (which it did in 2001) provoked unexpectedly sharp debates among scholars. As Wang described it, the terms of the debate had changed: ''Many people knew by then that globalization is not a neutral word describing a natural process. It is part of the growth of Western capitalism, from the days of colonialism and imperialism.'' Which is not to say that the New Left embraced an easy antiglobalist position; it has been critical of recent anti-Japanese and anti-American outbursts among urban, middle-class Chinese -- of what Wang dubbed ''consumer nationalism.'' That, Wang said, was the same kind of globalization that America advocates: ''It is really a form of hypernationalism, which is why you hear talk of tariffs and penalties on China when American economic interests are hurt.''
 Wang paused and then added: ''Many people also learned that the reason the Chinese economy did not collapse like the Asian tiger economies in 1997 was that the national state was able to protect it. Now, of course, China with its export-dominated economy is more dependent on the Western world order, especially the American economy, than India.''
 In January of this year, Wang published a long investigative article exposing the plight of workers in a factory in his hometown, Yangzhou, a city of about one million. According to Wang, in 2004 the local government sold the profitable state-owned textile factory to a real estate developer from the southern city of Shenzen. Worker-equity shares were bought for 30 percent of their actual value, and then more than a thousand workers were laid off after mismanagement of the factory led to losses. In July 2004, the workers went on strike. In what Wang calls an agitation without precedent in the history of Yangzhou, the workers obstructed a major highway, halted bus traffic and attacked the gates of local government buildings. 
 Wang told me that he was helping the workers to sue the local government. He had spent time working in a nearby factory before college and this, he said, made him feel a particular connection to them. He remembered that his pay had been low -- less than $2 a month by current exchange rates -- but, he said, what was crucial was that the workers he knew then felt secure in their jobs. ''People claim,'' he said, ''that the market will automatically force the state to become more democratic. But this is baseless. We only have to think about the alliance of elites formed in the process of privatization. The state will change only when it is under pressure from a large social force, like the workers and peasants.'' 
 Wang's story about Yangzhou is not unique. There are many accounts of how local government officials controlling public property have amassed fortunes by privatizing state assets. According to a recent report by the activist Liu Xiaobo, more than 90 percent of the 20,000 richest people in China are related to senior government or Communist Party officials. 
 For Wang, democracy is not just a simple matter of expanding political freedom for the middle class or creating legal and constitutional rights for a minority already substantially empowered by market reforms. Democracy in China, he said, has to be based upon the active consent and mobilization of the majority of its population, and be able to ensure social and economic justice for them.
 Yet for some New Left intellectuals, like Cui Zhiyuan, a close friend and collaborator of Wang's who teaches political science at Tsinghua University, there is opportunity in the collision of capitalism and socialism. ''There is more space here for new ideas,'' Cui told me as he described why he had returned to China after many years in the United States. ''The capitalist system is fixed in the West, but things are still in flux in places like China and India. We have a historic opportunity to build a better, more just society than the West.'' For Cui, it is important to clarify the concepts first. ''It is not helpful,'' he said, ''to see socialism and capitalism as opposed and separate. Both have traveled together in the 20th century. Not just European welfare states, even American capitalism has a socialist component, which was arrived at after compromise with the trade unions.''
 In recent years, Cui has found a receptive and powerful audience on an issue that lies at the very foundation of the Chinese socialist state: the collective ownership of property. Liberal Chinese economists argue that private property is sacred and inviolable in a market economy, a radical idea in the Chinese context. In an article he published in Dushu in 2004, Cui challenged this notion, emphasizing the essentially communal nature of property ownership. He cited Thomas Jefferson's decision to reword John Locke's principles of life, liberty and property with life, liberty and happiness in the Declaration of Independence. 
 ''Jefferson recognized,'' he said, ''that property rights emanate from society, not from nature. That's why there was no specific article on property rights in the U.S. Constitution and it had to be brought in later through the Fifth Amendment.'' Cui went on to relate with something close to glee that his article had circulated widely among legislators in the National People's Congress, China's Parliament, in 2004. It had helped, he said, to provoke a debate that led the Congress to adopt a compromise amendment to the constitution, similar in wording to the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which simply states that no person ''be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.'' 
 This spring it began to become clear that the New Left's advocacy of a welfare state is being echoed within the Communist leadership, which is fearful of social instability and is keen to consolidate its power and legitimacy. In March, a few weeks before I met with Wang, the National People's Congress convened in Beijing and unexpectedly became a forum for the first open ideological debate within the party for years. Legislators accused government officials of selling out China's interests to market forces. Such was the antimarket mood that a bill to defend private property and grant land titles to farmers -- one that both foreign investors in China and Chinese businessmen had been lobbying for -- was not even discussed. Describing major new investments in rural areas, the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, emphasized that ''building a socialist countryside'' was a ''major historic task'' before the Communist Party. He also outlined steps to balance economic growth with environmental protection.
 A German journalist told me that it was the most left-wing speech he had heard from a senior Chinese leader during his eight years in Beijing: ''Even American and European politicians don't talk about achieving a Green G.D.P.'' Wang agreed. He said that he was also pleased to see President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao focusing on relations with Asian countries. ''We were too obsessed with the United States during Jiang Zemin's time,'' he said. ''We really need to improve our relations with Japan and India. We belong to such old and distinguished civilizations, and we cannot just be simple followers and imitators of America. 
 ''It is a huge achievement,'' he added, a smile on his face, ''that the premier should openly admit that health care and education is a failure. It has never happened before.'' Wang said he thought that the government was sincere about eradicating rural poverty. But he was still cautious. ''There has been so much decentralization in China,'' he said, ''that it is not easy to translate central government policy into action.'' Last month, in the first purge of a high-ranking party member since 1995, the central leadership removed the Shanghai party chief on corruption charges, leading to speculation that there would be a reconfiguring of relations between the central government and provincial leaders and perhaps a shift in policy toward shoring up social-welfare systems and stemming pollution. Wang remained skeptical. ''The Shanghai case is encouraging at least,'' Wang said in a recent e-mail message. ''I think there will be some political results from it, but they are results rather than reasons.''
 The dangers of failing to improve conditions for the majority are clear to Wang: ''If we don't improve the situation, there will be more authoritarianism. We have already seen in Russia how people prefer a strong ruler like Putin because they are fed up with corruption, political chaos and economic stagnation. When radical marketization makes people lose their sense of security, the demand for order and intervention from above is inevitable.''
 In attacking corrupt local governments, the New Left often seems to want to institute big-brotherly government of the kind authoritarian politicians like. Certainly the growing accord between the central government's socialist rhetoric and New Left ideas makes many uneasy. Lung Yingtai, a well-known Taiwanese writer and democracy advocate, told me earlier this year that she was wary of the New Left intellectuals, who, she said, appear too close ideologically to the Communist regime. Taking this view one step further, Liu Junning, a popular liberal political theorist who left China in 1999 after being blacklisted by the Chinese government but has since returned, claimed that the New Left was another name for the nationalistic old guard of the Communist Party, which was inspired by hatred of the West.
 While this seems an exaggeration, Wen Tiejun, a former government official who runs rural reconstruction projects and is identified as New Left, had attended what he called ''brainstorming sessions'' with Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao. Typically, intellectuals in Communist countries (Vaclav Havel or Adam Michnik, for example) have gained moral authority by assuming a critical stance toward the all-powerful state. How do New Left thinkers in China calibrate their relationship with a state that has imprisoned many of their colleagues and generally shown little tolerance for criticism of the party? 
 When I posed this question to Cui, he momentarily lost his exuberant manner. ''It is a very important question,'' he said. ''How to deal with the government, both morally and intellectually. This is a big challenge for us.''
 Cui does not regard the Communist regime as a ''totality.'' There were, he said, many different aspects of it, at both the local and central levels. ''Almost every day,'' Cui said, ''The New York Times carries reports of peasants agitating against the Communist government, but if you listen to what the peasants are saying, they are telling the central government that the local government has violated their rights. So even the peasants can see the different aspects of the state, who supports them and who doesn't.''
 Wang Xiaoming, professor of cultural studies at Shanghai University, positions himself to the right of Wang Hui but says that he sympathizes with the New Left's pragmatic attitude toward the Communist regime. ''Civil society is very weak in China,'' he said, ''and since the government is the most active agent of change, we have to push the government to do what it should do besides pushing the government to give up some of its powers.''
 When I met with Wang Hui for the last time, he dismissed any claims about increased New Left influence over the regime. ''What we have tried to do is create an intellectual situation in which new policies can be explored,'' he said. ''I know that many leaders read Wen Tiejun's article; they also read Cui's article on property rights. There have been other articles in Dushu that have been equally influential, and I am pleased about this. But we have no other connection with the regime.''
 Wang also seems to have no anxiety that ideological convergence with the regime will turn New Left intellectuals into pro-government policy wonks and hacks, part of an old Chinese tradition of intellectuals advising the state. ''We look at things from a Chinese perspective naturally, but we also try to think beyond the framework of the nation-state,'' he said. ''People ask in the West, How could China develop capitalism with an authoritarian state? But that's ignoring how modern capitalism grew in the West, without much democracy and with the help of imperialism and colonialism. You have to ask whether this unique economic model of the West can be globalized without great wars and destruction of the environment. This is not an abstract issue. China has stopped felling its forests, most of which have disappeared, but some country still has to produce wood for Chinese consumption.''
 At our last meeting, Wang also spoke more about a subject Cui had brought up with me: how the rise of China and India throws up new challenges and possibilities with profound implications for the world at large. ''Western societies have been on top for the last two centuries and shaped the world with the decisions they made,'' he said. ''China and India will now play equally crucial roles in the new century. But what will they be? I think it is very important for Chinese and Indian intellectuals not just to imitate the West. They have to explore alternatives to the Western model of modernity. Otherwise, the 'consumer nationalists' are already saying, 'America was on top; now we are on top.''' 
 Wang laughed, and added, ''This is not interesting.''

HEADLINE: Opera at a Good Price, for Young and Old Alike 

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Operas for $20? New Audiences Hear Siren Song'' (front page, Oct. 9):
 While the Metropolitan Opera's offer of 200 tickets at $20 for weeknight performances is laudable, the notion that it will bring younger people to its audience is dubious. 
Most young people work until 5 or 6 p.m. and cannot reach the box office in time to buy tickets at the lower price. More than likely, the tickets will be bought by retirees and other seasoned standees. 
 A better idea would be to distribute these tickets through schools or earmark a portion to students under 30.

Bayside, Queens, Oct. 9, 2006

To the Editor:
 I resent the comments by Norman Peck, the president of the Peter Jay Sharp Foundation, regarding attendance at cultural events in the city: ''If you don't do something, you'll be left with guys who have false teeth and white hair'' and ''Eventually, they'll all die and you'll have nothing.''
 My husband and I, both in our 80's, have very good teeth, and his hair is beautifully white. Since our retirement, we have made at least one or more yearly trips to New York City, helping its local economy with our hotel stays, meals and attendance at musical events, museums and the theater. 
 Except for some senior admissions at museums, we have willingly financed our own expenses on the salaries of retired teachers -- which are by no means exorbitant.
 It would have been gracious of Mr. Peck to acknowledge the loyalty of attendees rather than to insult them. 
 We do not plan to die anytime soon, and plan many more visits to our favorite city.

HEADLINE: We Are a Camera

BYLINE: By David Hajdu. 
David Hajdu, the author of ''Lush Life'' and ''Positively Fourth Street,'' is the music critic for The New Republic.

 BODY:
THERE was an air of experimentation in the odd 15-minute television show starring Jonathan Winters that NBC ran weekly in the 1950's. Broadcast live, like nearly all television at the time, the program was largely unscripted, reliant on its star's dependably unpredictable comic imagination. Mr. Winters would amble out in front of the camera, and a stagehand would toss him an everyday object -- say, a pen and pencil set -- as the sole prop for a wholly improvised comedy routine. 
 Thus the audience was prepared for the unexpected and the occasional misfire when, 50 years ago this month, it was told the network would be conducting a test of a new technology. The musical interlude in that week's show, a two-and-a-half minute song by the ever-bubbly Dorothy Collins (then beloved as one of the stars of ''Your Hit Parade''), had been performed the day before the broadcast, captured through an experimental process called videotape recording, and inserted into the otherwise live telecast. The video era had begun. 
At the time, the networks thought of videotape mainly as a solution to a shipping problem, more a means of transportation than a radical new mode of communication. Their product, live television, was manufactured in New York, and their system of transport, the airwaves, could not carry it all the way across the country. The idea was that programs packaged on spools of videotape could be flown to the West Coast and rebroadcast the following day. This, in 1956, represented mass communication of unfathomable speed and reach. 
 Jonathan Winters saw something more in that R.C.A. tape machine the size of a Frigidaire sitting in his studio. Within weeks of that broadcast of Dorothy Collins's recorded tune, he concocted a routine using videotape to appear as two characters, bantering back and forth, seemingly in the studio at the same time. You could say he invented the video stunt, planting the creative seed for the wild overgrowth of gag clips that last week earned YouTube a sale price of $1.65 billion. 
 It is a neat coincidence -- perhaps a wrapping up of things by the fates -- that YouTube had its big payday exactly half a century after it was found that a sequence of action could be documented cheaply and easily, viewed immediately, disseminated widely and replayed endlessly. But it is also a sign of something America has lost; not our innocence, but instead our sense of awe -- the idea that technology should be used to challenge our creativity rather than as a crutch for quick fame or easy laughs. 
 Like the small, hazy box of free images that YouTube provides, video recording derived its appeal not from its technical quality, but from its immediacy and its economy. TV critics derided early broadcasts of taped sequences for their ''bleached'' hues and ''cloudy overcast.'' Magnetic recording improved with time, of course; still, video would never look as good as film until the digital era. Its tonal range was limited, and its definition was restricted by broadcast standards, and no one seemed to mind. 
 Video gave us Super Bowl instant replays, the Eyewitness News and ''America's Funniest Pets,'' as well as countless moments of instant iconography, from the moon landing to Sept. 11, 2001. The mere mention of such images is a cliche, a banality; such is the effect of the endless repetition videotape made possible. It diminishes the power of the images it documents, steadily desensitizing us to the events, much as each pass of a videotape across the heads of a VCR weakens the picture. 
 After the moon landing, two of the three TV networks and innumerable local stations erased their tapes to reuse them for subsequent newscasts of press conferences and fires. The fact that video could be erased ensured that it would be, and so did the ephemeral quality of the invisible patterns of magnetism into which video rendered scenes from life. 
 As Jack Gould, The Times's TV critic from 1947 to 1972, tried to explain video recording: ''The picture is translated into a succession of bursts of electricity. By magnetic means, these bursts are preserved on the moving tape. When the tape is played back, the tape recreates the original bursts of electricity.''
 In the 1980's, the early days of home video, I happened to hear a monologue on video's technical weirdness by the director Martin Scorsese, who said the medium made him nervous. While a great deal has always made Mr. Scorsese nervous, he appeared to find video acutely wracking. The preservationist in him found the fragile images of video unbearable, and the workhorse in him found the technology's ease of use unacceptable. With video, he said, the making of moving images was too easy. 
 Indeed, the emergence of camcorders in the 80's began to make moviemaking treacherously simple and inexpensive, within the grasp of nearly everyone. A generation has grown up with its childhood documented in near real-time on videos too long and dull to replay. 
 With digital cameras, camera phones and the Web to disseminate everything now, moving images seem nearly as commonplace as written language. The world has become an inversion of Orwell's long-dated vision of a future ruled by video; instead of being the objects of observation by a great totalitarian eye, we are all running about pointing digital video cameras, watching each other.
 Among the recurring characters Jonathan Winters played on his show was a man on the street being interviewed for television. He would be struck dumb by the camera, his eyes all whites, his lower lip flapping in panic. The character is still funny today, though as foreign to us as Chaplin's tramp. 
 We have become so accustomed to cameras everywhere that we know how to behave on video as well as we know how to order a burger. And we all know what such familiarity breeds. It is no wonder that, for the generation raised on video, the au courant way to address the camera is to exude contempt for it, degrading it. This is the YouTube aesthetic; and with it, Martin Scorsese's fears are realized. 
 To announce the sale of their company to Google, two of YouTube's founders, going by their first names -- Chad and Steve -- posted a video on their site. It was shot outdoors, in front of their building, with a handheld camera. We hear the sound of cars driving by in the background. Chad and Steve yak and ramble, and the camera keeps rolling after they're finished, waiting for a blooper moment that the fellows finally provide. 
 In its meticulous, ritualized casualness and indifference, the video is as formal and predictable as a presidential address from the Oval Office. Like a great many of the people on YouTube clips -- Jonathan Winters notwithstanding -- Chad and Steve treat themselves as a joke without bothering to be funny.

HEADLINE: New Rules for 'Exotic' Loans 

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
IS the era of the ''exotic'' mortgage near an end?
 Some analysts say the answer is yes, thanks to a new set of lending guidelines set forth by federal agencies that oversee many of the biggest lending institutions in the United States.
Late last month, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, among other agencies, issued new guidelines for marketing and underwriting two types of ''exotic'' loans: interest-only mortgages and adjustable-rate mortgages with payment options. 
 Among other things, the guidelines mandate underwriting procedures that regulators say will diminish the chances these loans will go to unqualified borrowers, as well as more explicit warnings for borrowers who may not know how costly these loans can get.
 Even though such loans are potentially riskier than traditional mortgages, they have boomed in popularity in the last three years because they can reduce the borrowers' monthly payments and thereby allow them to afford costlier houses.
 Interest-only loans, as the name implies, allow borrowers to pay back only the interest portion of their mortgages for a certain period, typically 7 or 10 years. So-called pay-option ARM's, meanwhile, allow borrowers to choose their monthly payment levels, even if it means paying back less than the nominal interest amount.
 In both cases, though, borrowers can face ''payment shock'' when the monthly mortgage bill skyrockets. For those with interest-only loans, that shock happens when they begin paying the principal on the loan, with payments far higher than if they had begun in earlier years of the loan.
 For borrowers with pay-option ARM's, the shock can come much earlier. If their interest payments are insufficient in the early years of the loan, the ''option'' element of the mortgage ceases and they face steeply elevated interest rates.
 Meanwhile, the market share of such loans has soared. More than 20 percent of all mortgages in July were interest-only loans, up from 10 percent three years ago, according to Loan Performance, a financial consultancy in San Francisco. Option ARM's accounted for 12 percent of all mortgages in July, up from 0.4 percent in mid-2003.
 Regulators have feared the effect such loans could have on the economy if borrowers defaulted en masse, so as part of the new guidelines, banks are required to follow certain procedures for determining who qualifies for these mortgages. Some banks had already put the procedures into effect as part of their own risk-management practices.
 More noticeable to consumers will be the new guidelines governing disclosure of the risks inherent in these loans. Starting this month, lenders covered by federal agencies are required to inform applicants early in the process how much their monthly rates could be in the most adverse case. In addition, when lenders advertise these loans, they must now mention the risks involved.
 ''We're not saying that these loans are bad,'' said Kevin Mukri, a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. ''These are good products if the circumstances call for them. But this helps make sure that people know exactly what they're getting into.''
 Mr. Mukri and others pointed out that the new guidelines do not apply to many lenders, whose operations are so localized that they are covered only by state, not federal, laws.
 The Conference of State Bank Supervisors, an industry group representing those who oversee state banks, said it would adopt similar standards, but since most states have not yet codified these regulations, industry analysts said prospective borrowers should approach nontraditional loans carefully because some lenders remain free to ignore the new guidelines.
 But now that the federal regulations have been adopted, fewer borrowers will probably choose exotic mortgages, said Howard Glaser, the principal in the Glaser Group, a mortgage consultancy in Washington. ''Most borrowers will still be able to get a loan,'' he said. ''It'll just be a more conventional loan.''

HEADLINE: Crunch Time on Property Taxes

 BODY:
If there were any doubts that the New Jersey Legislature must reduce the state's soaring property taxes, a Census Bureau report earlier this month should wipe them away. For homeowners with a mortgage, the state has the highest median housing costs of any state in the nation. Property taxes play a major role in those high costs. 
 The details are striking. Four of every 10 New Jerseyans pay 30 percent of their pretax income for housing; 15 percent pay half. Almost half of renters pay 30 percent of their pretax income for housing, and a quarter pay 50 percent. In Newark, 72 percent of mortgage holders paid more than 30 percent of their pretax earnings for housing.
 James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, says high property taxes together with high income and business taxes are having a negative impact on the state's economy. They are certainly working against Gov. Jon Corzine's efforts to bring industry to New Jersey.
 ''It's very difficult for business to transfer workers to New Jersey with its high taxes and high housing costs,'' Dr. Hughes says. One result is that New Jersey has had a net loss of 14,000 office jobs since late 2000. Another is the crescendo of anecdotes about people moving out of the state because of high property taxes. 
 All this adds to a single conclusion: legislators must do something drastic during their current special session on property taxes. 
 ''We have an expenditure problem, not a tax problem,'' Dr. Hughes says. The high annual increases in spending by schools and government at all levels mean that even if the Legislature were to raise income or sales taxes, the additional money would be eaten away in just a few years and the situation would again be as bad as it is now. 
 This means Trenton will have to make big, painful cuts in spending if taxes are to be brought under control. Health and retirement benefits for state, local and school employees, including teachers and police officers, are under discussion. But even those, which will face fierce opposition by public employee unions, will not be enough. 
 And then there is school spending, which few people want to talk about. At an average of about $11,500 per pupil each year, school spending is higher than in any other state, and it may have to come down. So too may the high rate of spending for schools in Newark, Jersey City and more than 25 other poor municipalities designated as special needs districts. These districts, which are supposed to receive the same amount of public money as the state's highest-spending districts, receive more than $14,000 per student. 
 Will a majority of senators and Assembly members risk antagonizing the special interest groups that will fight each of these proposals? New Jerseyans will soon learn which of their representatives have the courage to do something about curbing taxes, and which will succumb to politics as usual.

HEADLINE: The Proletariat And the Parking Lot 

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
SIDNEY HILLMAN, the fabled labor leader who helped create the 12-building union and socialist housing complex on Grand Street known as Co-op Village, once described his vision of America. It is a place, he said, ''that will give its citizens, first of all, a higher and higher standard of living so that no child will cry for food in the midst of plenty.'' 
 Given recent developments at Co-op Village, one wonders about Mr. Hillman's opinion about parking.
In late summer, the board of East River Housing Corporation, one of the four cooperatives within the Village, doubled the monthly fee for its 435 on-site parking spaces, to $150 from $75. The price rise will produce an additional $391,500 a year in revenue for East River, which has operated in the red for three years. 
 Many of the co-op's car owners, however, became accustomed to their strikingly low fees, and some find the price jump so upsetting for ideological reasons that they are suggesting, in unsigned leaflets, the ouster of the board. 
 Al Gaber, a retired accountant who worked for the city, has not called for the board's dismissal; he's a board member. But he had proposed a more modest increase of $25 a month, and is among the co-op residents who disagree with the board's decision. 
 ''If it's a co-op, where everything is owned jointly, I don't think you should charge market rates,'' Mr. Gaber said. ''It would be like a homeowner paying to park in their own garage.''
 For many other board members, however, the decision was economically necessary. ''You can't continue to run $800,000 to $900,000 in the red year after year,'' said Richard Valcich, the board's 64-year-old vice president. ''Who's going to pay the deficit?'' 
 By raising the parking rates, Mr. Valcich added, the board can keep maintenance fees low, a top priority for many of the co-op's elderly residents who live on fixed incomes. 
 Paying $150 a month for parking is still far below the standard for downtown Manhattan; at the Edison ParkFast at 220 South Street, spots go for $290 a month, and at Edison's lot at Spring and Varick Streets, the going price is $450. 
 But Co-op Village residents like Doris Hoenig say the comparison is unfair. ''We're not living on Park Avenue and we don't want to pay Park Avenue prices,'' Ms. Hoenig, a 64-year-old retired teacher, said as she stood last week in the co-op parking lot, a fenced-in area under the Williamsburg Bridge. 
 The parking fee rise is one of several recent price jumps -- in gym memberships and fuel surcharges, among other things -- that have put some co-op residents on edge. ''The increases are coming so fast and furious that people are worried they might get pushed out,'' Ms. Hoenig said. 
 Nevertheless, one economic pattern will probably endure at Co-op Village: the demand for a parking spot. The wait is now about 10 years. STEVEN KURUTZ

HEADLINE: A Real Old-Timers' Game

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
NEXT Saturday, the Flemington Neshanock and the Elizabeth Athletic Club will play an exhibition base ball game at Riverbank Park in Newark. 
 On exhibit will be men dressed in baggy 19th-century uniforms with woolen caps, long pants, even knickers and high stockings, playing a brand of vintage base ball -- the spelling of the era -- by the rules that governed the national pastime during the days of the Civil War.
Fans, or cranks, as they were known in the mid-1800's, should bring a scorecard (and maybe an eraser) for the journey back to those early innings, when it was one, two, three -- or sometimes four -- strikes you're out at the old ball game. While vendors may no longer be selling apples, sarsaparilla or birch beer, spectators will find an authentic slice of American heritage. 
 ''This game is not a re-enactment, but a recreation of the way the game was played in those times, using the very same rules from those years,'' said Paul Salomone, the captain of the Elizabeth Athletic Club. 
 ''Nothing we do out there is scripted,'' added Mr. Salomone, 49, who lives in Westfield, N.J., where the Elizabeth team is based. ''We are very competitive, but at the same time, we do our best to show spectators what fans of 19th-century base ball would have seen.''
 And what they might have heard.
 ''Well struck!'' players from that era would yell after a teammate made solid contact at the plate. ''Well done, sir,'' a fielder might be told after making a good play.
 ''It was a gentleman's game back then, so these are words that would have actually been spoken,'' said Brad Shaw, 52, the captain of the Flemington squad, who lives in Raritan Township, N.J. ''Sure, players got angry once in a while, but for the most part, these guys were all friends who treated the game, and each other, with respect -- and they rarely argued with an umpire.''
 Saturday's showcase will feature a Flemington team that adheres to base ball rules from the 1860's and 70's, when pitchers threw underhand and fielders did not wear gloves, and an Elizabeth team that plays by the rules of 1891, when pitchers had begun throwing overhand and a few position players wore gloves just slightly larger than their hands. 
 The Flemington and Elizabeth teams are among 55 clubs that play in the Vintage Base Ball Association, a nonprofit barnstorming circuit across 32 states that runs from April to October. 
 Scheduled for 10 innings, the game Saturday will be split in half, allowing each team to play its chosen style for five innings. Modern-day cranks will learn that batters were called strikers and ground balls up the middle were called daisy cutters.
 Then there are the rules, which Mr. Salomone and Mr. Shaw said were as difficult for the players to grasp as for their fans.
 ''It takes a lot of imagination to transform yourself into an 1891 ballplayer,'' Mr. Salomone said. ''It's a lot of fun, but very challenging.'' 
 To illustrate that point, Mr. Shaw imagined a situation involving an outfielder in the mid-1800's playing a line drive on one hop. The batter would not be credited with a base hit, but would be called out. 
 While vintage base ball is popular in New Jersey, it made an initial comeback in 1980 in Old Bethpage, N.Y., to coincide with the annual Long Island Fair. Eleven teams, including the Cold Spring Spiders, Glen Head Zig Zags and Bellmore Seminoles -- actual names of 19th-century clubs -- competed on the Hewlett Playing Grounds at the Old Bethpage Village Restoration, playing an 1860's style of base ball.
 Next April, an organization calling itself the Vintage Base Ball Federation will begin operation with an estimated 100 teams in 15 to 20 states. It was founded by the former major league pitcher Jim Bouton, who will serve as its commissioner, and Greg Martin, its president. The board includes Fay Vincent, the former Major League Baseball commissioner; Frank Deford, the veteran sports journalist; John Thorn, a baseball historian; and Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist. 
 Mr. Martin, who lives in Hartford, organized vintage base ball tournaments there from 2000 to 2004, three-day events that drew more than a dozen teams and up to 10,000 fans a year. He also opened the Hartford-based Vintage Base Ball Factory, which manufactures 19th-century uniforms and equipment. 
 In July 2004, Mr. Martin and Mr. Bouton teamed up to organize what Mr. Martin called ''a farewell game,'' in Pittsfield, Mass. The game was to be played at Wahconah Park, a longtime minor league ballpark that was to undergo a multimillion-dollar restoration to give it an antiquated look, including signs of the era, wooden grandstands and a manually operated scoreboard.
 Two months before that game, Mr. Thorn discovered a document from 1791 suggesting that a version of baseball was already being played at that time in Pittsfield. Before then, the creation of baseball had been widely credited to Abner Doubleday in Cooperstown, N.Y., in 1839, though some later traced the game's beginnings to Hoboken, N.J., in 1846. More recently, a New York University librarian found two newspaper references to a form of ''base ball'' in 1823 in New York City. 
 With Pittsfield in the national headlines, ESPN Classic decided to present the so-called farewell game on television, and 6,500 fans filled the ballpark, built to seat 4,000. 
 The cranks went to see a team called the Pittsfield Hillies, put together by Mr. Bouton, play the Hartford Senators, assembled by Mr. Martin. The Hillies played an early 20th-century style of baseball, the Senators a late-19th-century version. Outside the park, actors playing turn-of-the-century newsboys held newspapers detailing the day's events. ''Extra! Extra!'' they shouted. ''Read all about it!'' 
 ''That game in Pittsfield was really the inspiration for where we are today,'' Mr. Martin said. ''It reconfirmed my vision that vintage base ball could be packaged and marketed. After ESPN covered the event, I saw a bigger potential in terms of growing the concept nationally.'' 
 While the vintage groups are not exactly rivals, Mr. Salomone of the Vintage Base Ball Association and others contend that the Vintage Base Ball Federation is not always playing by the rules of the era.
 ''They are intentionally designing their league to be historically inaccurate,'' Mr. Salomone said. ''They feel that by combining different aspects of the game from different eras, they are somehow providing more entertainment for their spectators.''
 To that, Mr. Bouton replied, ''We've simply decided to cover a swath of time as opposed to any single year, and to incorporate the most interesting rules and equipment that were in use during the latter half of the 19th century, because that is a really fun way of looking at history.''
 ''They are historians, they want to focus on a given year and get it exactly right, which is one way to do it,'' he said of the Vintage Base Ball Association. ''What we are is a combination of theater, history and unscripted sports competition, and by using excellent players, we are also capturing the athleticism of those times.''

HEADLINE: A Real Old-Timers' Game

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
NEXT Saturday, the Flemington Neshanock and the Elizabeth Athletic Club will play an exhibition base ball game at Riverbank Park in Newark. 
 On exhibit will be men dressed in baggy 19th-century uniforms with woolen caps, long pants, even knickers and high stockings, playing a brand of vintage base ball -- the spelling of the era -- by the rules that governed the national pastime during the days of the Civil War.
Fans, or cranks, as they were known in the mid-1800's, should bring a scorecard (and maybe an eraser) for the journey back to those early innings, when it was one, two, three -- or sometimes four -- strikes you're out at the old ball game. While vendors may no longer be selling apples, sarsaparilla or birch beer, spectators will find an authentic slice of American heritage. 
 ''This game is not a re-enactment, but a recreation of the way the game was played in those times, using the very same rules from those years,'' said Paul Salomone, the captain of the Elizabeth Athletic Club. 
 ''Nothing we do out there is scripted,'' added Mr. Salomone, 49, who lives in Westfield, N.J., where the Elizabeth team is based. ''We are very competitive, but at the same time, we do our best to show spectators what fans of 19th-century base ball would have seen.''
 And what they might have heard.
 ''Well struck!'' players from that era would yell after a teammate made solid contact at the plate. ''Well done, sir,'' a fielder might be told after making a good play.
 ''It was a gentleman's game back then, so these are words that would have actually been spoken,'' said Brad Shaw, 52, the captain of the Flemington squad, who lives in Raritan Township, N.J. ''Sure, players got angry once in a while, but for the most part, these guys were all friends who treated the game, and each other, with respect -- and they rarely argued with an umpire.''
 Saturday's showcase will feature a Flemington team that adheres to base ball rules from the 1860's and 70's, when pitchers threw underhand and fielders did not wear gloves, and an Elizabeth team that plays by the rules of 1891, when pitchers had begun throwing overhand and a few position players wore gloves just slightly larger than their hands. 
 The Flemington and Elizabeth teams are among 55 clubs that play in the Vintage Base Ball Association, a nonprofit barnstorming circuit across 32 states that runs from April to October. 
 Scheduled for 10 innings, the game Saturday will be split in half, allowing each team to play its chosen style for five innings. Modern-day cranks will learn that batters were called strikers and ground balls up the middle were called daisy cutters.
 Then there are the rules, which Mr. Salomone and Mr. Shaw said were as difficult for the players to grasp as for their fans.
 ''It takes a lot of imagination to transform yourself into an 1891 ballplayer,'' Mr. Salomone said. ''It's a lot of fun, but very challenging.'' 
 To illustrate that point, Mr. Shaw imagined a situation involving an outfielder in the mid-1800's playing a line drive on one hop. The batter would not be credited with a base hit, but would be called out. 
 While vintage base ball is popular in New Jersey, it made an initial comeback in 1980 in Old Bethpage, N.Y., to coincide with the annual Long Island Fair. Eleven teams, including the Cold Spring Spiders, Glen Head Zig Zags and Bellmore Seminoles -- actual names of 19th-century clubs -- competed on the Hewlett Playing Grounds at the Old Bethpage Village Restoration, playing an 1860's style of base ball.
 Next April, an organization calling itself the Vintage Base Ball Federation will begin operation with an estimated 100 teams in 15 to 20 states. It was founded by the former major league pitcher Jim Bouton, who will serve as its commissioner, and Greg Martin, its president. The board includes Fay Vincent, the former Major League Baseball commissioner; Frank Deford, the veteran sports journalist; John Thorn, a baseball historian; and Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist. 
 Mr. Martin, who lives in Hartford, organized vintage base ball tournaments there from 2000 to 2004, three-day events that drew more than a dozen teams and up to 10,000 fans a year. He also opened the Hartford-based Vintage Base Ball Factory, which manufactures 19th-century uniforms and equipment. 
 In July 2004, Mr. Martin and Mr. Bouton teamed up to organize what Mr. Martin called ''a farewell game,'' in Pittsfield, Mass. The game was to be played at Wahconah Park, a longtime minor league ballpark that was to undergo a multimillion-dollar restoration to give it an antiquated look, including signs of the era, wooden grandstands and a manually operated scoreboard.
 Two months before that game, Mr. Thorn discovered a document from 1791 suggesting that a version of baseball was already being played at that time in Pittsfield. Before then, the creation of baseball had been widely credited to Abner Doubleday in Cooperstown, N.Y., in 1839, though some later traced the game's beginnings to Hoboken, N.J., in 1846. More recently, a New York University librarian found two newspaper references to a form of ''base ball'' in 1823 in New York City. 
 With Pittsfield in the national headlines, ESPN Classic decided to present the so-called farewell game on television, and 6,500 fans filled the ballpark, built to seat 4,000. 
 The cranks went to see a team called the Pittsfield Hillies, put together by Mr. Bouton, play the Hartford Senators, assembled by Mr. Martin. The Hillies played an early 20th-century style of baseball, the Senators a late-19th-century version. Outside the park, actors playing turn-of-the-century newsboys held newspapers detailing the day's events. ''Extra! Extra!'' they shouted. ''Read all about it!'' 
 ''That game in Pittsfield was really the inspiration for where we are today,'' Mr. Martin said. ''It reconfirmed my vision that vintage base ball could be packaged and marketed. After ESPN covered the event, I saw a bigger potential in terms of growing the concept nationally.'' 
 While the vintage groups are not exactly rivals, Mr. Salomone of the Vintage Base Ball Association and others contend that the Vintage Base Ball Federation is not always playing by the rules of the era.
 ''They are intentionally designing their league to be historically inaccurate,'' Mr. Salomone said. ''They feel that by combining different aspects of the game from different eras, they are somehow providing more entertainment for their spectators.''
 To that, Mr. Bouton replied, ''We've simply decided to cover a swath of time as opposed to any single year, and to incorporate the most interesting rules and equipment that were in use during the latter half of the 19th century, because that is a really fun way of looking at history.''
 ''They are historians, they want to focus on a given year and get it exactly right, which is one way to do it,'' he said of the Vintage Base Ball Association. ''What we are is a combination of theater, history and unscripted sports competition, and by using excellent players, we are also capturing the athleticism of those times.''

HEADLINE: Refurbishing Computers, and Lives, Too

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
MARINA RIVAS, 43, had no formal training when she became interested several years ago in the internal workings of computers. She began taking home discarded computers she spotted in her neighborhood and taking them apart, becoming familiar with their parts and learning to make relatively simple repairs and revisions, like replacing missing sound cards and reformatting hard drives. 
 But there was much more she wanted to know and do. 
 Nyatui Turnage, 26, had ''book smarts'' about computers, as he calls his conceptual knowledge from college courses in information sciences and technology, but he had never taken a computer apart. 
 And Carlos Quinones, 33, not only lacked either kind of experience, but barely even used a computer, making him, in his own words, a ''cave man.''
 All this was before the three enrolled in the free computer-technician training program run by Per Scholas, a nonprofit group that combines the program with two other operations at its headquarters in the Hunts Point neighborhood of the Bronx. One is reconditioning used computers and selling them at low cost to low-income families and schools. The other is disposing of computers that are beyond upgrading, in an environmentally responsible way -- thus reducing, at least to some extent, the vast amount of toxic materials that end up in landfills and municipal incinerators. 
 The toxic elements in computers and their monitors include lead, mercury and cadmium. The landfill dumping threatens ground water while the burning pollutes the air, many environmental specialists say.
 Per Scholas (pronounced per SKO-las), a Latin phrase that means ''for schools,'' was founded in 1995 to upgrade desktop computers that corporations discard as obsolete and to provide them, at low cost, to schools unable to afford computers. The founder, John Hoyt Stookey, who has been a corporate executive in the chemical and fuel industries, is the group's board chairman.
 Since Per Scholas was established, it has distributed about 35,000 computers, not only to schools, but to families as well, said Plinio Ayala, the group's president and chief executive. The group charges families $195 for a computer, which comes loaded with an operating system and software; the price also includes a monitor, keyboard and speakers, though not a printer. 
 About 80,000 other computers that have been provided by government agencies and individuals, in addition to private companies, have been found unsuitable for upgrading, Mr. Ayala said.
 Such computers are first processed at the group's quarters in disposal machinery that separates metal, plastic and other materials and removes the mercury, he said. The separated materials are then sent to recycling companies for reuse or for safe disposal. Fifty-five people work in the computer reconditioning and recycling operation at the Bronx site. (The group also has a smaller operation in Miami with five employees.)
 Per Scholas began a permanent computer technician training program in 1998, said Linda Quinones-Lopez, the group's training director. From 1998 to last year, she said, 1,105 people enrolled in the course in the Bronx, 860 graduated and 729 got jobs, nearly all in computer-related work at other organizations. She expects this year's enrollment to total nearly 300.
 Eligibility requirements for the full-time 15-week course include a high school or high school equivalency diploma and a passing grade in a 10th-grade-level reading and math test. Applicants must be 18 to 55 and be either unemployed or underemployed. The course teaches the assembly, configuration, installation and repair of personal computers, printers and copying machines, and the design, installation and trouble-shooting of networks. The average age of the students is about 35, Per Scholas says, and at enrollment, more than 90 percent are either unemployed, seeking a first job, re-entering the labor force or looking for a vocation after release from prison. 
 Mr. Turnage, a Manhattan resident who said he left college for financial reasons, spoke of going from completion of the training course in December to computer technician or help-desk work, and ultimately to an executive job in information technology. 
 Mr. Quinones, a Bronx resident who recently finished the course, expressed interest in computer networking. And Ms. Rivas, who is from Brooklyn and is nearly finished with her training, said she hoped to move from receiving welfare to ''a very good job'' in computers and information technology.

HEADLINE: Security Council Supports Sanctions on North Korea

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE; David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 14 

 BODY:
The Security Council voted unanimously on Saturday to impose strict sanctions on North Korea for its reported nuclear test, overcoming objections from Russia and China by explicitly excluding the threat of military force.
 The resolution, drafted by the United States, clears the way for the toughest international action against North Korea since the end of the Korean War. Primarily, it bars the sale or transfer of material that could be used to make nuclear, biological and chemical weapons or ballistic missiles, and it bans international travel and freezes the overseas assets of people associated with the North's weapons programs.
In its most debated clause, the resolution authorizes all countries to inspect cargo going in and out of North Korea to detect illicit weapons.
 That power was the sticking point in days of what the Russian ambassador called ''tense negotiations'' with China and Russia that continued up until minutes before the final vote Saturday afternoon. And less than an hour after joining in the Council vote for the resolution, the Chinese ambassador, Wang Guangya, said China would not participate in the inspection regime because it would create ''conflict that could have serious implications for the region.'' 
 He said China supported the resolution as a necessary way to respond to Pyongyang's ''flagrant'' behavior.
 The 15-0 vote came days after North Korea's claim it had tested a nuclear device, reflecting the immediate global alarm that such a weapon could wind up in the hands of terrorists or other rogue states. Indeed, the resolution's wording hit most of the tough points the United States and Japan, in particular, had sought.
 But China's refusal to take part in searches, and Russia's seeming annoyance at the end of the process, immediately raised questions about how effective the resolution's execution could be. And it raised the prospect, too, that similar action sought by the United States against Iran could face a much tougher battle. 
 After the vote, John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, insisted that China was bound by the resolution's terms and would have to find a way to comply with the inspection provision. ''I can't believe that China won't adhere to obligations that the Security Council has imposed,'' he said.
 Ambassador Pak Gil-yon of North Korea told the Council that his government ''totally rejected'' the resolution, and he accused the panel's members of ''gangster-like'' action and a ''double standards'' attitude that neglected the nuclear threat posed by the United States.
 He said if the United States continued to ''increase pressure'' on North Korea, his government would consider it a declaration of war and take ''critical countermeasures.'' He then rose from his guest seat at the end of the horseshoe-shaped table and left.
 Mr. Bolton asked to be heard and pointed to the empty chair, saying Mr. Pak's impulsive departure was the equivalent of Khrushchev's pounding his desk in protest in the General Assembly. The Russian ambassador, Vitaly I. Churkin, complained that the reference, even at a moment that he described as Mr. Bolton's ''emotional state,'' was ''an inappropriate analogy.''
 Current and former Bush administration officials, and experts on the North, said that while the sanctions did not go as far as Washington wished, they probably gave it and Japan the legal means to squeeze the country. They provide the basis to inspect ships in ports around the world -- though not necessarily on the high seas -- and gives Washington a way to expand a program to force banks to halt dealings with the country.
 Earlier this year, Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, said that the huge pressure put on one small bank in Macao, Banco Delta Asia, ''was the first thing we ever did that got their attention.'' Today one of his aides said, ''Our plan is that Banco Delta is just a beginning.''
 What the administration did not get was authority to use military force to stop ships in international waters. To win over China, it agreed to drop explicit reference to a chapter of the United Nations Charter that authorizes the possible use of military power to enforce sanctions.
 ''This isn't going to be like the Cuban missile crisis, where we put up a full blockade,'' said Michael Green, who led Asia operations on the National Security Council staff until last year, and is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
 The big loophole concerns policing the North's border with China. The two countries had about $1.7 billion in trade last year. The Chinese declaration Saturday cast doubt on the likelihood that China would inspect, much less stop, much of the trade moving across that border.
 Speaking Saturday outside the White House, President Bush said the resolution sent ''a clear message to the leader of North Korea regarding his weapons programs. This action by the United Nations, which was swift and tough, says that we are united in our determination to see to it that the Korea Peninsula is nuclear-weapons-free.''
 In addition to the sanctions and search regime, the resolution demands that North Korea abandon its illicit weapons programs and rejoin the nonproliferation treaty, and it calls on the government to return to the so-called six-nation talks involving South Korea, Japan, China, Russia and the United States.
 [On Sunday, Russia's deputy foreign minister, Aleksandr Y. Alekseyev, who arrived in Beijing following talks in North Korea, said, ''Several times the North Korean side returned to the question that the six-sided process should continue, that they have not rejected the six-sided negotiations and that the goal of the six-sided negotiations -- the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula -- remains,'' according to the official Russian Information Agency.]
 A ban on the shipment of luxury goods in the resolution was particularly championed by Mr. Bolton and J. D. Crouch, the deputy national security adviser, as a way to harm the North's leader, Kim Jong-il, administration officials said. Mr. Kim does not command the kind of loyalty that his father, Kim Il-sung, the country's father and ''Great Leader,'' did until his death in 1994. So instead, according to North Korean defectors, he buys allegiance with Mercedes-Benz cars, bottles of cognac and plenty of walking-around money.
 Mr. Bolton alluded to that this week when he said that one intent of the resolution was to put Mr. Kim, who presides over a starving country but travels on luxurious train cars, on a diet. He said that the resolution left Pyongyang ''utterly and totally isolated'' and that the government should see its only way back to international acceptance was ''abandoning weapons of mass destruction and not continuing to go after them.''
 Mr. Bolton said the measure was aimed at illicit activities of Pyongyang like ''money laundering, counterfeiting and selling of narcotics.'' Those words, however, were removed to gain Chinese and Russian approval. The final draft also dropped a broad arms embargo in favor of one just on heavy equipment like battle tanks, artillery systems, missiles and warships.
 Despite the changes, Mr. Bolton said, ''We think this represents essentially what the United States was asking for when it circulated its draft resolution on Monday.'' 
 Asked about the effect of Saturday's decision on the debate expected next week over sanctions on Iran for its refusal to suspend its nuclear program, he said, ''I think this shows quite strongly that the Council is not going to tolerate proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and Iran should learn from this lesson.''
 But Mr. Churkin, the Russian ambassador, signaled that an obstacle in the talks over North Korea would also arise in the Iran debate, where Russia and China have also been reluctant to back direct punishments.
 Noting that in the cases of both North Korea and Iran, the United States had imposed its own sanctions, he said, ''It is unhealthy that when discussing collective measures and trying to be cooperative and forming a unified approach, one country comes out and adopts unilateral measures which also apply to other countries that are participating in the discussion.''
 He said, ''We very much hope that our American colleagues understand, in terms of the problems we have to solve and tackle in the next stage of our work in the Security Council.''

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD and DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
The declaration last Monday by North Korea that it had conducted a successful atomic test brought to nine the number of nations believed to have nuclear arms. But atomic officials estimate that as many as 40 more countries have the technical skill, and in some cases the required material, to build a bomb.
 That ability, coupled with new nuclear threats in Asia and the Middle East, risks a second nuclear age, officials and arms control specialists say, in which nations are more likely to abandon the old restraints against atomic weapons.
The spread of nuclear technology is expected to accelerate as nations redouble their reliance on atomic power. That will give more countries the ability to make reactor fuel, or, with the same equipment and a little more effort, bomb fuel -- the hardest part of the arms equation. 
 Signs of activity abound. Hundreds of companies are now prospecting for uranium where dozens did a few years ago. Argentina, Australia and South Africa are drawing up plans to begin enriching uranium, and other countries are considering doing the same. Egypt is reviving its program to develop nuclear power. 
 Concern about the situation led the International Atomic Energy Agency to summon hundreds of government officials and experts from around the world to Vienna in September to discuss tightening restrictions on who is permitted to produce nuclear fuel.
 ''These dangers are urgent,'' Sam Nunn, an expert on nuclear proliferation and a former Democratic senator, told the group. ''We are in a race between cooperation and catastrophe and, at this moment, the outcome is unclear.''
 But even the atomic agency itself exemplifies some of the underlying tensions inherent in the development of nuclear energy.
 For decades, the I.A.E.A., known as the world's nuclear policeman, has pursued its other mandate -- to promote safe nuclear power -- by running technical aid programs with roughly a hundred states. Some of that knowledge could be useful in a weapons program, though the aid is meant exclusively for civilian use. 
 The agency still helps Pakistan, which exploded a nuclear bomb in 1998. It also helped North Korea until a decade ago. Even today, it is assisting Iran, which many experts fear is close to mastering the basics of making a bomb. It has 14 programs under way with Iran, including a study on upgrading a nuclear research laboratory, as well as helping it start up its Bushehr reactor.
 North Korea's reported test has shaken the nuclear status quo and raised anew the question of whether Asia will be the first to feel a nuclear ''domino effect,'' in which states clandestinely hedge their bets by assembling the crucial technologies needed to make a bomb, or actually cross the line to become new weapons states. In the Middle East, the confrontation with Iran has focused new attention on countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, both of which fear that an Iranian bomb would make Tehran the greatest power in the region.
 Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the I.A.E.A., has estimated that up to 49 nations now know how to make nuclear arms, and he has warned that global tensions could push some over the line.
 ''We are relying,'' he said, ''primarily on the continued good intentions of these countries -- intentions which are in turn based on their sense of security or insecurity, and could therefore be subject to rapid change.''
 Worry about proliferation is hardly new. In March 1963, President John F. Kennedy said, ''I am haunted by the feeling that by 1970, unless we are successful, there may be 10 nuclear powers instead of 4, and by 1975, 15 or 20.'' That timetable proved to be inaccurate. But in recent years there has been a sense around the globe that President Kennedy's prediction is about to come true, three decades late.
 Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, said this year that ''the international community seems almost to be sleepwalking'' down a path where states, after long living without nuclear arms, now feel compelled to revisit their logic.
 He warned of a new arms race -- not one of superpowers, but of regional powers. ''Perhaps most damaging of all,'' he concluded, ''there is also a perception that the possession of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction offers the best protection against being attacked.''

A New Nuclear Vision
 Democrats and Republicans spent the past week arguing over who lost control of North Korea, Bill Clinton or George W. Bush. But seeds of the problem were planted by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, just months after the armistice ended the fighting on the Korean Peninsula in 1953.
 ''It is not enough to take this weapon out of the hands of soldiers,'' President Eisenhower told the United Nations that year, just as his administration was completing a series of 11 nuclear tests. ''It must be put in the hands of those who will know how to strip its military casing and adapt it to the arts of peace.''
 His program was called Atoms for Peace, and soon involved dozens of nations, all seeking to unlock the magic of nuclear power. The first generation of nuclear reactors sprang up around the globe, as did a huge supporting industry and an international overseer, the I.A.E.A.
 But almost from the start, evidence accumulated that countries were using the civil alliances and reactor technologies to make bombs. By 1960, France had joined the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union as a nuclear weapons state. China conducted its first test in 1964. Israel had the bomb by 1967, India by 1974, South Africa by 1982 (it has since given up its weapons) and Pakistan by 1998.
 All but the original three built their weapons by exploiting at least some technologies that were ostensibly civilian, nuclear analysts say. They enriched uranium beyond the low level needed for power reactors. Or they mined the spent fuel of civil reactors for plutonium -- the path that North Korea started taking in the late 1980's or early 1990's, according to American intelligence officials. 
 The international atomic agency, which still inscribes Atoms for Peace on its business cards, has worked hard to fight this kind of cheating while also helping with the basic technology. In the 1980's, it aided Iran's hunt for uranium. 
 Even today, Iranian technicians fly to Vienna and agency experts go to Iran to lend a hand. In August, two experts went to review progress at the Bushehr reactor, which is scheduled to go critical next year.
 ''It's helping establish that the plant is run in a safe and secure manner, which is in everybody's interest,'' said M. Peter Salema, an agency official. ''Look at Chernobyl. That's the whole point.''
 Many of the agency's cooperative projects use nuclear science to humanitarian ends, like fighting disease and treating cancer. But others involve more basic atomic skills.
 ''We provide expert services,'' Dr. Salema said, ''so they can learn to do things for themselves.''

The Technology Boom
 The Manhattan project scientists who built the first atom bomb predicted that the diffusion of their secret knowledge was inevitable. It was just a question of time. Now, after decades of scholarly digging, government declassification, open research in uranium and plutonium metallurgy and the rise of the Internet, much of that information is freely available.
 ''The general concepts are widely known,'' said Robert S. Norris, the author of ''Racing for the Bomb.'' ''Still, it's another thing to actually do it. That still requires certain skills of engineering and chemistry and physics.''
 The hardest part, experts agree, is not acquiring the weapons blueprints but obtaining the fuel. That is becoming easier because of developments both overt and covert.
 Abdul Qadeer Khan, a chief architect of Pakistan's nuclear arms program who went on to establish the world's largest atomic black market, sold the secrets of how to make centrifuges for enriching uranium to Libya, Iran and North Korea. Tehran insists its intentions are entirely peaceful, though most analysts judge that all three countries bought from the black market because they wanted to make nuclear arms.
 Dr. Khan sold plans and parts for Pakistan's first-generation centrifuge, the P-1, as well as the next generation, the P-2, which can spin faster to enrich uranium more rapidly.
 Investigators are still trying to learn where else Dr. Khan may have planted his nuclear seeds. They discovered outposts of his network in Dubai, Malaysia and South Africa and found that before his downfall in 2004 he visited at least 18 countries, including Egypt, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan, Syria and Saudi Arabia. 
 The worrisome enrichment trends involve not just stealthy military advances but also soaring demands for nuclear power, driven by rising populations, dwindling oil supplies and fears that the combustion of fossil fuels is warming the planet.
 ''The nuclear renaissance is gaining momentum,'' said George B. Assie, vice president for business development at Cameco, the world's largest publicly traded uranium company, based in Canada.
 In London, the World Nuclear Association says 28 new reactors are under construction, 62 planned, and 160 proposed, most in Asia. The required uranium, it estimates, could run to more than 65,000 tons.
 While it is not clear if the expansion of the world's civilian atomic infrastructure will ultimately lead to a rise in the number of countries building nuclear arms, it could give more countries the means to do so.
 There are two main ways to turn civilian technology to military use. The first is to enrich uranium fuel from its usual level of 5 percent for reactors to the 90 percent needed for a bomb, a modest step that requires longer processing in centrifuges. The second is to take spent reactor fuel and mine it for plutonium, the other main fuel for a bomb.
 The Brazilian military, for example, worked hard for decades to develop centrifuges to enrich uranium fuel for a bomb, a secret program it renounced in the 1990's. 
 In May, Brazil, despite growing pressure to give up indigenous production, inaugurated its first uranium enrichment plant -- an assembly of advanced centrifuges in Resende, in the state of Rio de Janeiro. While Iran has aroused global suspicions for erecting a similar plant, Brazil managed to reassure other nations, and the international atomic agency, that its aims are peaceful.
 ''We have an urgent need to expand the electric system,'' said Leonam dos Santos Guimaraes, an official of Electronuclear, which operates nuclear power plants in Brazil.
 Forecasting the size of the revitalized global industry is difficult. Even so, the predictions can be staggering. Hans-Holger Rogner, an economist at the international atomic agency, said that many forecasts for the 21st century foresaw huge expansions beyond the 443 power reactors now operating globally.
 ''An increase to 5,000 reactors is well within the range of many of the longer-range studies,'' Dr. Rogner said, adding: ''People are positioning themselves. There seems to be a race coming and nobody wants to be left out.''

A Complex Game
 A day after North Korea's nuclear test, Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, vowed not to abandon Japan's commitment to reject and never possess nuclear weapons, a cornerstone of Japanese foreign policy since Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
 But, even so, Japan already has all the component parts. It has many tons of plutonium left over from the operation of its reactors, according to a 2004 government report to the I.A.E.A. A small nuclear warhead requires only 10 pounds.
 Japan is the ultimate example of a ''nuclear option'' state, a country that the world knows could become an atomic power virtually overnight, if need be. ''They could be very far down the road toward a virtual deterrent and not be in violation of any of the existing international treaties,'' said Robert L. Gallucci, the former chief American negotiator with North Korea, and now dean of Georgetown University's school of foreign service.
 South Korea has also vowed not to pursue nuclear weapons. But it has an extensive network of nuclear power reactors and a few years ago, I.A.E.A. inspectors found evidence of undeclared experimentation to make highly enriched uranium. In the early 1990's, South Korea signed an agreement to keep the Korean Peninsula nuclear-free -- but it signed the accord with North Korea.
 Iran's nuclear rise has prompted concerns that the Middle East could experience similar pressures. In the region, only Israel is believed to possess nuclear arms, although it has never confirmed that. If Iran -- a Shiite state -- does indeed build nuclear weapons, there are fears that Sunni powers like Saudi Arabia or Egypt will be tempted to make their own bombs. 
 Egypt, which long ago sought to build nuclear arms, may be starting to rethink its earlier renunciation. The 1998 nuclear tests by India and Pakistan shook Cairo. ''Egypt's leaders had placed their bet clearly in favor of the Middle East and the world moving away from nuclear weapons,'' said Robert J. Einhorn, a former senior State Department nonproliferation official. ''But here was a disquieting indication that movement might be in the opposite direction.''
 Recently, the international atomic agency found that Egypt had kept some of its old and new efforts cloaked in secrecy, including a continuing project to acquire uranium ore in the Sinai desert. In September, Cairo announced plans to revive its stalled program to build reactors for generating nuclear power. It gave no sign of whether it, like Iran, planned to make reactor fuel on its own. 
 So the question now is whether North Korea's test, and Iran's challenge, will change the calculus. ''When additional countries get the bomb, it does create new pressures,'' said Matthew Bunn of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, who tracks the spread of nuclear technology. ''But each country is unique and there's little risk that the dominoes will fall quickly, especially if we take steps to prevent it.''

New Ground Rules
 When atomic specialists gathered in Vienna in September to discuss new ground rules for a second nuclear age, their proceedings were fueled by the fear that some of the old restraints -- both technological and political -- are fraying. 
 The central proposal debated at the I.A.E.A.'s headquarters sounded simple: No longer should nations be permitted to develop their own means of enriching uranium to make reactor fuel, which Iran and other developing states have claimed as their inalienable right under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Nearly 40 years after the treaty was drafted, the dangers simply seem too great. 
 Instead, the argument went, nations should band together to make multinational fuel banks where they could watch one another, making sure no fuel is diverted for bomb production. 
 ''A threat exists,'' said Sergei Kirienko, director of the Russian Federal Atomic Energy Agency. ''We understand that only those solutions that are resolved together, that ensure access for all nations today, will be successful.''
 Russia took the lead, proposing an international fuel bank that it would set up on its own soil by next year -- and from which it could potentially extract billions of dollars in sales. But the big splash came when Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire philanthropist, pledged $50 million for a fuel bank to be run by the I.A.E.A., making the United Nations body a ''supplier of last resort'' for any country that forsakes making its own fuel. The Bush administration has backed similar plans.
 But while there is agreement on the problem, solutions bogged down in bickering -- from weapons states that want to maintain their capacity and from developing nations that sniff a conspiracy to deny them the same nuclear rights that large powers have long enjoyed.
 ''We should guard against the notion that sensitive technologies are safe in the hands of some, but pose a risk when others have access to them,'' said Buyelwa Sonjica, the energy minister of South Africa, which wants to restart its enrichment program and build up to six reactors. 
 Few parties involved in the debate are optimistic about reform, and some say the enterprise is doomed to failure.
 ''Nuclear power is inextricably linked with nuclear proliferation,'' the environmental group Greenpeace said in a recent statement. ''None of the schemes being promoted will solve this problem. In fact, they will make it worse.''
 So far, though, the countries that the world most wants to stop from enriching say they have seen no reason to do so.
 At a dinner in New York in September, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran looked supremely confident as he batted away the idea that other countries could be relied upon to provide him with the nuclear fuel he said he needed.
 ''Before stopping enrichment by others, why don't you stop building the next generation of nuclear weapons?'' he asked his American hosts. Then, smiling, he suggested that the United States just buy its nuclear fuel from Iran's new facilities. He would sell it to Washington, he said, ''with a 50 percent discount.''

HEADLINE: Citing Heavenly Injunctions to Fight Earthly Warming 

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE

DATELINE: WYANDOTTE, Mich. 

 BODY:
To find St. Elizabeth Roman Catholic Church in this working class suburb south of Detroit, look toward the roofline, for the windmill. Not a big windmill, it is a spare steel structure maybe nine feet high, perched atop the rectory of the church and facing northeast into the winds that come off Lake Erie. 
 Yet the windmill, two solar panels on the roof, another atop the front porch and a solar water heating system above the garage are the pride of the Rev. Charles Morris, St. Elizabeth's priest.
Over the last five years, Father Morris has sharply reduced his small parish's energy use and emissions of carbon dioxide, the compound most scientists believe has led to global warming, and he has organized other congregations across Michigan to do the same. 
 ''We're all part of God's creation,'' Father Morris said. ''If someone like me doesn't speak about its care, who will? The changes we've made here, that's a form of preaching.''
 Over the last year, religious activism on global warming has won much attention. Last February, 86 evangelical Christian leaders backed an initiative to combat global warming, a move that broke the evangelical movement's broad silence on the issue but exposed stark divisions. 
 In October, 4,000 congregations of various faiths will show films on global warming, including ''An Inconvenient Truth.'' [On Oct. 8, Christian, Muslim, Jewish and Buddhist leaders met in Philadelphia to discuss global warming.] 
 At ground level, clergy members and lay people have been working to increase awareness of global warming and to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions. Many, like Father Morris, were active for years before the issue attracted wider concern. Encounters in their own lives awakened them to global warming, they said. But their faith and the imperatives they see in their Scriptures compelled them to act, they said. 
 ''If you do worship the Creator, you take care of his creation,'' said Greg Wickersham, a high school teacher and a member of the environmental ministry at Intown Community Church in Atlanta, which is affiliated with the theologically conservative Presbyterian Church in America.
 ''If we are made in his image, we should mirror his image in our dominion over the Earth,'' Mr. Wickersham said. ''He is creative and sustaining, not destructive.''
 Father Morris is the executive director of the 124-member Michigan Interfaith Power and Light, the state affiliate of Interfaith Power and Light, the religious association that organized the screenings of the global warming films. 
 The Michigan organization's representatives speak to local congregations about global warming and ways to counteract it. They arrange for ''energy audits,'' so people can learn how to reduce consumption without sacrificing comfort. Changes include replacing regular light bulbs with long-life fluorescent ones and more ambitious projects like installing solar panels. 
 In 2005 and the first three quarters of 2006 combined, energy-saving efforts by the group's members have prevented the release into the atmosphere of 14,130 tons of carbon dioxide, according to Enerficiency, an energy consulting firm. Investments in new technology are projected to save the group's congregations nearly $2 million ''over the life of the new products,'' Enerficiency said. 
 St. Elizabeth itself has reduced its peak energy demand by 60 percent over the last five years and has reduced its annual energy bills by $20,000, Father Morris said. 
 Father Morris's interest in the environment was nurtured as he roamed farmland next to his childhood home in southern Ohio, times, he said, when he had ''an experience of the divine.'' 
 His readings and his degree in urban planning sharpened his awareness of global warming. And his faith buttresses his activism, he said. He notes that the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has urged greater care of the environment. He cites Biblical passages, like Genesis 2:15, that call upon humans to care for God's creation.
 Father Morris has found allies in poor urban churches and well-to-do mosques and synagogues in the suburbs. Rabbi Daniel Nevins of Adat Shalom Synagogue in Farmington Hills, a northwest suburb of Detroit, draws inspiration from many of the Bible passages Father Morris cites. Rabbi Nevins focuses much of his efforts on bringing environmental concerns into some of the worship at Adat Shalom.
 At Yom Kippur, as part of a ritual when Jews admit their sins before God, Rabbi Nevins added a passage he wrote about the ''sin of destroying God's creation.'' As Jews celebrate the Sukkot holiday and sleep in temporary structures meant to evoke those that Jews lived in during their 40 years in the desert, they are also meant to see the beauty of nature and the fragility of their own existence, Rabbi Nevins said. 
 Still, it is slow going, he said. The sprawling Conservative synagogue has replaced many of its windows and lights and instituted a large recycling program, but Rabbi Nevins wants to do more. ''There's not an active resistance, but people give lip service to environmental ideas and don't change their lifestyle,'' he said. 
 Many clergy members run into resistance stemming from theology, economics or politics. The Rev. Gerald Durley of Providence Baptist Church in Atlanta, a largely African-American congregation, said that parishioners often thought of global warming as a distant issue, while problems like crime or the spread of AIDS must be tackled now. 
 Mr. Durley said he reminded them that in the early 1980's, many blacks dismissed AIDS as a remote issue, too, one that affected only gay white men. 
 Despite the February statement by prominent evangelicals about global warming, many in the pews remain unconvinced, often because they see it as an issue of the political left. 
 ''When I give talks on environmental stewardship at Christian colleges, I have students look me in the eye and ask, 'Is global warming real?' '' said Dave Mahan, associate director of the Au Sable Institute of Environmental Studies, a Christian environmental education organization headquartered in Grand Rapids, Mich. ''I answer that God wants us to lead a stewardly life whether or not there is global warming.''
 The Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, a Catholic religious order for women, used an opportunity to renovate their 73-year-old mother house in Monroe, Mich., to create a model of sustainable energy and water use. 
 The 376,000-square-foot building is heated and cooled by geothermal power, provided by some 240 wells dug on the order's property. Water from sinks and showers, or ''gray water,'' is fed into a natural filtration and treatment system in a series of ponds and then recycled for use in toilets. Some lawns have been given over to natural meadows to reduce watering and mowing. Insulation is made of recycled materials. The building now saves $200,000 annually in energy costs.
 Some neighbors find the shaggy meadows unsightly. The city had to be persuaded to allow the gray water scheme. But the order, the average age of whose members at the mother house is 86, is also asked regularly to advise other groups, religious and secular, on building energy efficient facilities.
 ''We are recreating the monastery of old, where people come to learn how to live into the next century,'' said Sister Janet Ryan, a member of the order's leadership council. ''Our dream is that the mother house serves as something of an ecological lab. For a bunch of elderly women, we have a huge agenda.''

HEADLINE: It's Official: To Be Married Means to Be Outnumbered

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Married couples, whose numbers have been declining for decades as a proportion of American households, have finally slipped into a minority, according to an analysis of new census figures by The New York Times.
 The American Community Survey, released this month by the Census Bureau, found that 49.7 percent, or 55.2 million, of the nation's 111.1 million households in 2005 were made up of married couples -- with and without children -- just shy of a majority and down from more than 52 percent five years earlier.
The numbers by no means suggests marriage is dead or necessarily that a tipping point has been reached. The total number of married couples is higher than ever, and most Americans eventually marry. But marriage has been facing more competition. A growing number of adults are spending more of their lives single or living unmarried with partners, and the potential social and economic implications are profound.
 ''It just changes the social weight of marriage in the economy, in the work force, in sales of homes and rentals, and who manufacturers advertise to,'' said Stephanie Coontz, director of public education for the Council on Contemporary Families, a nonprofit research group. ''It certainly challenges the way we set up our work policies.'' 
 While the number of single young adults and elderly widows are both growing, Professor Coontz said, ''we have an anachronistic view as to what extent you can use marriage to organize the distribution and redistribution of benefits.''
 Couples decide to live together for many reasons, but real estate can be as compelling as romance.
 ''Owning three toothbrushes and finding that they are always at the wrong house when you are getting ready to go to bed wears on you,'' said Amanda Hawn, a 28-year-old writer who set up housekeeping near San Francisco with her boyfriend, Nate Larsen, a real estate analyst, after shuttling between his apartment and one she shared with a friend. ''Moving in together has simplified life,'' Ms. Hawn said.
 The census survey estimated that 5.2 million couples, a little more than 5 percent of households, were unmarried opposite-sex partners. An additional 413,000 households were male couples, and 363,000 were female couples. In all, nearly one in 10 couples were unmarried. (One in 20 households consisted of people living alone).
 And the numbers of unmarried couples are growing. Since 2000, those identifying themselves as unmarried opposite-sex couples rose by about 14 percent, male couples by 24 percent and female couples by 12 percent.
 Matt Foreman, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, said gay couples were undercounted because many gay people were reluctant to disclose their sexual orientation. But he said that inhibition seemed to be fading.
 ''I would say the increase is due to people feeling more comfortable disclosing that they are gay or lesbian and living with a partner,'' he said.
 The survey did not ask about sexual orientation, but its questionnaire was designed to distinguish partners from roommates. A partner was defined as ''an adult who is unrelated to the householder, but shares living quarters and has a close personal relationship with the householder.''
 Some of the biggest gains in unmarried couples were recorded in unexpected places. In the rural Midwest, the number of households made up of male partners rose 77 percent since 2000.
 The survey revealed wide disparities in household composition by place. The proportion of married couples ranged from more than 69 percent in Utah County, Utah, which includes Provo, to 26 percent in Manhattan, which has a smaller share of married couples than almost anyplace in the country. But Manhattan registered a 1.2 percent increase in married couples since 2000, in contrast to the rest of New York City and many other places.
 Among counties, the highest proportion of unmarried opposite-sex partners was in Mendocino, Calif., where they made up nearly 11 percent of all households.
 The highest share of male couples was in San Francisco, where, according to the census, they accounted for nearly 2 percent of all households. In Manhattan, they made up 1 percent of households. Hampshire County, Mass., home to Northampton, had the highest proportion of female couples, at 1.7 percent. Some of the highest numbers of unmarried couples were recorded in the South, which as defined by the census, has the largest population of any region.
 David Blankenhorn, president of the marriage advocacy group the Institute for American Values, said married couples had become a minority largely because of the growing number of households made up of people who planned to marry or who used to be married.
 Steve Watters, the director of young adults for Focus on the Family, a conservative Christian group, said that the trend of fewer married couples was more a reflection of delaying marriage than rejection of it.
 ''It does show that a lot of people are experimenting with alternatives before they get there,'' Mr. Watters said. ''The biggest concern is that those who still aspire to marriage are going to find fewer models. They're also finding they've gotten so good at being single it's hard to be at one with another person.''
 But Pamela J. Smock, a researcher at the University of Michigan Population Studies Center, said her research -- unaffiliated with the Census Bureau -- found that the desire for strong family bonds, and especially marriage, was constant. 
 ''Even cohabiting young adults tell us that they are doing so because it would be unwise to marry without first living together in a society marked by high levels of divorce,'' Ms. Smock said.
 A number of couples interviewed agreed that cohabiting was akin to taking a test drive and, given the scarcity of affordable apartments and homes, also a matter of convenience. Some said that pregnancy was the only thing that would prompt them to make a legal commitment soon. Others said they never intended to marry. A few of those couples said they were inspired by solidarity with gay and lesbian couples who cannot legally marry in most states.
 Jennifer Lynch, a 28-year-old stage manager in New York, said she had lived on the Lower East Side with her boyfriend, who is 37 and divorced, for most of the five years they have been a couple.
 ''Cohabitating is our choice, and we have no intention to be married,'' Ms. Lynch said. ''There is little difference between what we do and what married people do. We love each other, exist together, all of our decisions are based upon each other. Everyone we care about knows this.''
 If anything, she added, ''not having the false security of wedding rings makes us work even a little harder.''
 With more competition from other ways of living, the proportion of married couples has been shrinking for decades. In 1930, they accounted for about 84 percent of households. By 1990 the proportion of married couples had declined to about 56 percent.
 Married couples have not been a majority of households headed by adults younger than 25 since the 1970's, but among those aged 25 to 34 the proportion slipped below 50 percent for the first time within the past five years. (Among Americans aged 35 to 64, married couples still make up a majority of all households.)
 ''It's partially fueled by women in the work force; they don't necessarily have to marry to be economically secure,'' said Andrew A. Beveridge, a demographer at Queens College of the City University of New York, who conducted the census analysis for The New York Times. ''You used to get married to have sex. Now one of the major reasons to get married isto have children, and the attractiveness of having children has declined for many people because of the cost.''
 William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, attributed the accelerated trend to the lifestyles of baby boomers.
 ''It's the legacy of the boomers that have finally caused this tipping point,'' Dr. Frey said. ''Certainly later generations have followed in boomer footsteps, with high levels of living together before marriage, and more flexible lifestyles. But the boomers were the trailblazers, once again, rebelling against a norm their parents epitomized.
 ''This would seem to close the book on the Ozzie and Harriet era that characterized much of the last century,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Democrats Have an Intensity, But G.O.P. Has Its Machine

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER; Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 

 BODY:
Clif Kelley, a retired economist from Columbus, Ohio, is the walking, talking, fuming embodiment of what pollsters say is a defining feature of this election: the intensity of Democrats.
 Mr. Kelley and a handful of fellow Democrats in Franklin County's 21st Ward began meeting about two years ago, calling themselves Grassroots 21. Today they have a newsletter, a blog and on one recent Sunday a sprawling audience crammed into Mr. Kelley's suburban backyard for a rally on a semi-rainy day.
Mr. Kelley reminded his friends that he vowed two years ago he would not die under a Bush administration. ''You can see I've been holding on,'' he said as the audience roared.
 Mr. Kelley is 89. And angry. He says he simply ''can't wait'' for Election Day. 
 Voter intensity is a critical element in politics, especially in midterm elections, when Americans' interest and turnout are typically much lower than in a presidential election year. Pollsters say enthusiasm among Democrats is particularly high this year -- significantly higher, by several important measures, than the intensity of Republicans.
 Republican strategists counter that they can compensate for any gap in enthusiasm with their legendary get-out-the-vote operation. The party has built its electoral success in the last two elections on identifying and producing nearly every obtainable Republican vote at the polls; this time may be more challenging, they say, but no different.
 ''I do think our base is coming together and will be coming together later, but four weeks is an eternity in this business,'' said Representative Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican and longtime party strategist. Republicans will ultimately be motivated to vote, Mr. Cole said, and they will turn out on Election Day even if ''this is a race where professionalism has to make up for enthusiasm.'' 
 Even so, in the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, conducted Oct. 5-8, 46 percent of Democrats said they were more enthusiastic about voting this year than in previous Congressional elections, compared with 33 percent of Republicans. 
 A similar trend appears in recent polls by the Pew Research Center and Gallup, which show that Democrats' level of engagement is higher than in the midterm elections of 2002, 1998 and especially 1994, when a Republican landslide gave the party control of the House and Senate.
 Democratic strategists consider this new intensity a critical advantage throughout the ups and downs of a campaign narrative driven at various times by war, national security scares, gas prices and, most recently, the scandal surrounding former Representative Mark Foley, Republican of Florida.
 ''There's been a consistent pattern for the better part of a year that Democrats are pretty focused on what they're voting for and what they're voting against,'' said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, ''while Republican voters are feeling ambivalent on both fronts.''
 Voter intensity can bubble up from the grass roots, but it can also be stoked (or dampened) by the candidates' campaigns and harnessed by a sophisticated turnout campaign.
 Conservative voters have many reasons to be less enthusiastic this year, analysts say, including their party's deficit spending and the scandal over Mr. Foley's conduct toward Congressional pages, not to mention an array of local Republican scandals in Ohio. But if the Republican get-out-the-vote drive, known as the 72-Hour Project, lives up to its billing, said Andrew Kohut, head of the Pew center, ''the turnout consequences for the G.O.P. might not be as dire as these poll numbers suggest.''
 The Republican machine was on full display last weekend in Ohio, where volunteers worked phone banks in all 88 counties on what the party called Super Saturday. They contacted 100,000 carefully selected potential Republican voters and knocked on the doors of 50,000. When the day was done, Jason Mauk, the political director for the state party, said, ''I think that really discredits the notion that Republican voters and volunteers are not energized.''
 At one of those phone banks, in downtown Columbus, the energy level was high, fueled by endless trays of doughnuts, bagels and pizza. Shift after shift of volunteers rotated through, with a steady murmur of voices reading a script, urging a vote, offering to arrange an absentee ballot: ''This is a very important election year, and your vote will help determine Ohio's future.''
 One of the volunteers, Laurie Sutton, said: ''I hit the phone banks every night. I'm addicted to it.''
 At midday, several of the top Republican candidates came by to rally the troops. Betty Montgomery, who is running for state attorney general, acknowledged the challenges facing Republicans this year but summoned the memory of the Ohio State football coach Woody Hayes. ''We know how to win,'' she said. ''We know the fundamentals. He would say, 'Execute the fundamentals!' ''
 Ms. Montgomery recalled the 2004 election, when Ohio delivered the presidency to Mr. Bush, largely on the basis of the Republican turnout operation. ''We blew their socks off,'' she said of the Democrats. ''They didn't know what hit them.''
 But Ohio Democratic leaders say they do know what hit them two years ago and vow that it will not happen again. ''The Republicans talk about that 72-hour operation as if it's the best thing since electricity,'' said Chris Redfern, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. ''The fact is, I believe we will be competitive.''
 Underscoring the rivalry, Ohio Democrats said they also completed 100,000 calls that Saturday. Around the country, though, some Democrats wonder whether their party can match the well-financed 72-Hour Project, created by the Republican National Committee; some of the outside groups who worked on voter turnout for the Democrats in 2004 have curtailed their efforts, although party campaign committees insist that they have stepped forward to fill the gap.
 Ohio is a state where the partisan war has raged, with little interruption, since 2004. But polls suggest that around the nation, voters understand what is at stake in these midterm elections.
 Two major factors drive the Democratic intensity, analysts say: anger about the war in Iraq and other Bush administration policies, and optimism about their chances this year. 
 ''I feel like there's some hope to get more Democrats elected this time,'' said Virginia Crossett, 53, a Democrat and veterinary technician in Louisville, Ky., who was interviewed in a follow-up to the recent Times/CBS poll. Half of the Democrats who were more enthusiastic about voting said they felt that way because victory was in reach.
 ''I think most of the Republicans are doing a horrible job, and I don't feel like my life is any better whatsoever in the last six years -- and probably worse,'' Ms. Crossett said. 
 The flip side to the Democrats' optimism, of course, is that the prospect of Democratic control is a powerful motivator for many Republicans. 
 ''A lot of issues are important to me, major issues like the war on terror, what's going on in Iraq, North Korea and Iran, immigration and the Mexican border,'' said Rick Nunley, 40, a Republican from North Canton, Ohio, who works in industrial sales. ''Those issues will be affected drastically in the not-too-distant future if there are major policy changes or shifts in the government.''
 Republicans say they will keep working to harness their vote. Holly Pendell, a veteran Republican volunteer who works for the United States Chamber of Commerce, was canvassing a suburban Columbus subdivision last Sunday with her ''walk book'' that identified which houses to visit. The advertising campaign started so early and became so intense that people ''can't even make sense of the ads,'' Ms. Pendell said. ''That's why door-to-door is so important.''
 Democrats say they will be doing the same, while also counting on the intensity of the Clif Kelleys of the country. When the Democrats lost the presidential race in Ohio two years ago, it was a painful defeat to many on the local level. But Grassroots 21 has made real progress in its neighborhood, Mr. Kelley said, and ''it gave us confidence that we could so something.'' 
 ''What really pushes us now is the issues,'' Mr. Kelley said. ''We're mad. I'm mad.''
 The group, in fact, recently adopted a new logo: the Fighting 21st.

HEADLINE: Feeding Appetites For the Ipod Of Apples

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: TIVOLI, N.Y. 

 BODY:
''This is really like a franchise apple,'' Peter Gregg, a spokesman for the New York Apple Association, was saying the other day. ''You know how sports teams talk about franchise players? This is like that. Nothing in recent memory has created this kind of a buzz. It's definitely our most exciting new product. People bite into them, and they just go crazy.''
 O.K. Maybe apple people are getting a little overly excited about the Honeycrisp apple. But, hey, if you had what you thought of as the apple business (tree-grown division) version of the iPod in your orchards, maybe you would get a little overly excited, too. 
So in the odd mix of agronomy and product development that is the farming business in much of New York, consider the Honeycrisp apple. On the market for less than a decade, though still hard to find and unknown to many consumers, it is already a legend in its time and an object lesson in the new economics of ag marketing.
 First, let me say, journalistic objectivity aside, they're on to something. Of course, unless you spend time at farmers' markets you might not know what a Honeycrisp apple is. And even if you do, a comparison with an iPod might seem a bit off. You can't download Eminem or Nickelback to one.
 But the Honeycrisp, developed in 1991 by two researchers at the University of Minnesota, really is kind of amazing: firm, wonderfully flavorful, tart and sweet at the same time. It's no wonder that they often sell for twice as much as other apples and that growers sound like used-car dealers when they talk about them.
 ''I've been doing this for 30 years, and there's nothing that's come close to this,'' said Tre Green of Chazy Orchards in Chazy, N.Y. He was one of the first people in the state to try them and now has them on about 80 of his 800 acres. ''It's a hard apple to grow, but it has such a spectacular taste, I think supply is going to take a long, long time, if ever, to catch up with demand.''
 And if nothing in his experience selling apples is comparable, how about in other businesses? He paused: ''Well, maybe the development of the Internet for information exchange.''
 Like most farming stories, the apple story is either horrible (glut, drought, hail, heat, imports) or terrific (bumper crop). This year, it seems to be pretty terrific. One reason, aside from good weather, is that farmers' markets have matured into a standard part of the food chain, allowing farmers to sell their wares directly. Another is that many farmers have become such smart marketers and product developers.
 Take Chuck Mead, 51, and his dad, Sid, 82, at Mead Orchards in northern Dutchess County, where their family has been farming since 1916. In the early 1990's, Chuck Mead was thinking of packing it in -- too much work, too little gain, little prospect of things changing.
 But, in fact, they did. And now instead of just selling fruits and vegetables wholesale, at least half his business is selling at farmers' markets, including ones every week in Mount Vernon, White Plains, the Bronx, Ossining and Rhinebeck. The pick-it-yourself business at the farm is having perhaps its best year, and his own sales there are going well. 
 And rather than planting the same crops, he has developed into something like a buyer at Neiman-Marcus, always alert for exciting new product lines.
 So even though he is near the southern end of the range for growing them, he has planted about 800 or 900 Honeycrisp trees, with plans to add 1,000 more next year.
 ''This is a much more complicated business than it used to be,'' said Mr. Mead, who farms 185 acres on gorgeous hilly terrain across the Hudson from the Catskills. ''You want to pick up on something new, and if you wait four or five years, you might miss it. But you also don't want to plant a whole bunch of something that turns out to be a dog.''
 So, along with his tart cherries from Hungary and slightly weird Asian pears, along with the Cortlands, Cameos, Mutsus and Senshus, the Macouns, Idareds, Romes and Galas, Mr. Mead is now tending his Honeycrisps, a cross between a Macoun and a Honeygold. 
 And having flirted with getting out, he is now so committed to farming he has sold the development rights to his land, meaning it will stay agricultural in perpetuity.
 Still, in the brave new world of entrepreneurial ag, he has one place where he draws the line.
 ''Well, there's also the entertainment angle,'' he said. ''You know the farms that have hay mazes, corn mazes, petting zoos, all kinds of stuff? That's fine for some people and not for others. We get calls all the time: Do you do hayrides, do you do this or that? I just say, no, but we have a beautiful view of the mountains.''

HEADLINE: COMPETITIVE ERA FAILS TO SHRINK ELECTRIC BILLS 

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
A decade after competition was introduced in their industries, long-distance phone rates had fallen by half, air fares by more than a fourth and trucking rates by a fourth. But a decade after the federal government opened the business of generating electricity to competition, the market has produced no such decline.
 Instead, more rate increase requests are pending now than ever before, said Jim Owen, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, the association for the investor-owned utilities that provide about 60 percent of the nation's power. The investor-owned electric utility industry published a June report entitled ''Why Are Electricity Prices Increasing?''
 About 40 percent of all electricity customers -- those in 23 states and the District of Columbia where new competition was approved -- mostly paid modestly lower prices over the past decade. But those savings were primarily because states, which continue to have some rate-setting power, imposed cuts, freezes and caps at the behest of consumer groups that wanted to insulate customers from any initial price swings. 
 The last of those rate protections expire next year, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and other federal agencies warn in a draft report to Congress that ''customers may experience rate shock'' as utilities seek to make up for revenue they did not collect during the period of artificially reduced prices and to cover higher costs of fuel. They warned that ''this rate shock can create public pressure'' to turn back from electricity prices set by the market to prices set by government regulators.
 The disappointing results stem in good part from the fact that a genuinely competitive market for electricity production has not developed. 
 Concerned about rising prices, California and five other states have suspended or delayed transition to the competitive system. 
 And voters around two California cities, Sacramento and Davis, will decide next month whether to replace investor-owned utilities with municipal power in hopes of lowering rates. Drives are under way to expand public power in Massachusetts. In Portland, Ore., the city council tried and failed to buy the local utility company.
 Electric customers in other states are facing rude surprises. 
 In Baltimore, an expected 72 percent rate increase in electricity prices has aroused so much protest that the state legislature met in special session, where it arranged to phase in the higher costs over several years. In Illinois, rates are about to rise as much as 55 percent.
 The three New York area states opened their electricity markets to competition, with different results.
 In Connecticut, residential electric rates rose up to 27 percent last year to an average of $128 a month, and are expected to go up as much as 50 percent more in January. 
 In New Jersey, rates rose up to 13 percent this year, and are poised to go much higher. 
 New York residential customers, by contrast, paid an inflation-adjusted average of 16 percent less in 2004 than in 1996, a state report said. It is not known how much of that is attributable to government-ordered rate cuts, but the state benefited from huge increases in power generated by its nuclear plants and by buying power from New England plants that, starting next year, may have less electricity to sell to New York. 
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and five other agencies, in the draft of the report to Congress, are unable to specify any overall savings. ''It has been difficult,'' the report states, ''to determine whether retail prices'' in the states that opened to competition ''are higher or lower than they otherwise would have been'' under the old system.
 Joseph T. Kelliher, the commission chairman, said Friday that eventually ''market discipline will deliver the best prices'' and noted that every administration and Congress since 1978 had pushed the industry toward competition. He added that the commission recognized a need for ''constant reform of the rules.''
 Under the old system, regulated utilities generated electricity and distributed it to customers. Under the new system, many regulated utilities only deliver power, which they buy from competing producers whose prices are not regulated. For example, Consolidated Edison, which serves the New York City area, once produced almost all the power it delivered; now it must buy virtually all its electricity from companies that bought its power plants and from other independent generators. 
 The goal is for producers to compete to offer electricity at the lowest price, savings customers money. 
 Independent power producers, free-market economists and the Clinton Administration cheered in 1996 when the federal government allowed states to adopt the new system. The new rules ''will benefit the industry and consumers to the tune of billions of dollars every year,'' Elizabeth A. Moler, then chairwoman of FERC, said at the time. She said the new rules would ''accelerate competition and bring lower prices and more choices to energy customers.''
 But that has not happened. A truly competitive market has never developed, and, in most areas, the number of power producers is small. In New Jersey, for example, only six companies produce power, and not all of them sell to every utility. 
 Some utilities have decided to buy electricity not from the cheapest supplier but from one owned by a sister to the utility company, even if that electricity is more expensive. That has been the case in Ohio. 
 And if electricity is needed from more than one producer, utilities pay each one the highest price accepted in the bidding, not the lowest. This one-price system, adopted by the industry and approved by the federal government, is intended to encourage investment in new power plants, which are costlier than older ones.
 But critics say that, as in California five years ago in a scandal that enveloped Enron, the auction system can be manipulated to drive up prices, with the increases passed on to customers. What is more, companies that produce electricity can withhold it or limit production even when demand is at its highest, lifting prices. This happened in California, and the federal commission has found that it occurred in a few more instances since then. Critics say that more subtle techniques to reduce the supply of power are common and that the commission shows little interest in investigating. 
 Bryan Lee, a FERC spokesman, said complaints of manipulation are investigated, but only last year did Congress give the commission the legal tools to punish manipulators. 
 Under the new system there have been some big winners -- including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group, the private equity firm -- that figured out that there were huge profits to be made in one area of the new system. 
 Such investors have in some cases resold power plants they just bought, making a large profit. In other cases, investors have bought power plants from the utilities at what proved to be bargain prices, then sold the electricity back at much higher prices than it would have cost the utility to generate the electricity. 
 Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general, said the supposedly competitive market has been ''a complete failure and colossal waste of time and money.'' 
 He asked the federal commission to revoke competitive pricing in his state, but the commission dismissed the complaint last Wednesday, saying the state had not proved its case. 
 Advocates of moving to the new system say that, in time, the discipline of the competitive market will mean the best possible prices for customers. Alfred E. Kahn, the Cornell University economist who led the fight to deregulate airlines and who, as New York's chief utility regulator in the 1970's, nudged electric utilities toward the new system, said that he was not troubled by the uneven results so far. 
 ''Change,'' Professor Kahn said, ''is always messy.''
 But some advocates of introducing competition to the electric industry have soured on the idea. They include the Cato Institute, a leading promoter of libertarian thought that favors the least possible regulation and that concluded earlier this year that government and electric utilities have made such hash of the new system that the whole effort should be scrapped. 
 ''We recommend total abandonment of restructuring,'' Cato said. If the public rejects a greater embrace of markets, Cato wrote, the next best choice would be a ''return to an updated version of the old'' system.
 The conflicting results among the many studies of electric prices stand in contrast to the sharp, unambiguous drops in the prices of telephone calls, air travel and trucking.
 One study by the utility economist Mark L. Fagan, a senior fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and a consultant to various businesses who favors a competitive system, found that the new system often produces better results. He found that in 12 of 18 states that restructured, prices were lower for industrial customers than they would have been under the old system. But he also found that prices were somewhat lower than his model predicted in seven of 27 states that did not open to competition. 
 In Virginia, a state that did not move to the new system, a report last month by the agency that regulates utilities found ''no discernible benefit'' to customers in the 16 states that had gone the farthest and warned that electricity prices in those states ''may actually be increasing faster than for customers in states that did not restructure.''
 And Professor Jay Apt, a former astronaut who runs the electricity study center at Carnegie-Mellon University, found that savings from introducing competition to sales of electricity to large industrial customers ''are so small that they are not meaningful.''
 Regardless of the debate over the effectiveness of the new system, electricity prices are expected to rise in the next few years for several reasons apart from any rise in the price of coal, natural gas, oil, uranium and other fuels. 
 A study issued in June by the Edison Foundation, which represents investor-owned utilities concluded that utilities would have to raise rates to upgrade local distribution systems and to finance long-distance transmission lines, as well as for new power plants. The study found that utility profit margins had thinned and financial strength had weakened. It called for relief in the form of higher rates. 

Power Play
 Articles in this series will examine the decade-long effort to overhaul the nation's electricity system.


GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: ''Regulated Monopolies Or Competitive Markets?''For decades electricity was provided by legal monopolies, with prices regulated by state utility commissions. A decade ago half the states began moving to a system in which regulated utilities only deliver the electricity, which they buy from competing producers whose prices are not regulated. The goal is for producers to compete to offer electricity at the lowest price. But in many cases prices have not fallen, and rates paid by customers are rising faster than fuel prices. Six states have slowed or suspended their move to the new system, and a growing array of industrial companies, state attorneys general and consumer groups are questioning whether the competitive model is so flawed that the old system may be better.Map of the United States highlights the status of electric market pricing for each state according to the following criteria:TRADITIONAL REGULATIONRESTRUCTURING DELAYED OR SUSPENDEDCOMPETITIVE PRICING(Source by Energy Information Administration)(pg. 24)

HEADLINE: Salmon Find a Surprising Ally In the Rugged Far East of Russia 

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: UTKHOLOK RIVER BIOLOGICAL STATION, Russia 

 BODY:
The wild salmon still rush the dark Utkholok and other rivers here in Kamchatka, one of the last salmon strongholds on earth. They surge in spring and come in pulses for months, often side by side in run after run.
 All six native species of Pacific salmon remain abundant on this eastern Russian peninsula, scientists say, appearing by the tens of millions to spawn in its free-running watersheds. Even in October's chill they come: coho and a trickle of sockeye, mixed with sea-run trout and char.
Now, in a nation with a dreary environmental record that is engaged in a rush to extract its resources, the peninsula's governments are at work on proposals that would designate seven sprawling tracts of wilderness as salmon-protected areas, a network of refuges for highly valuable fish that would be the first of its kind.
 Encompassing nine entire rivers and more than six million acres, the protected watersheds would exceed the scale of many renowned preserved areas in the United States. Together they would be more than four times the size of the Everglades, nearly triple that of Yellowstone National Park and slightly larger than the Adirondack Park, which is often referred to as the largest protected area in the lower United States. 
 These areas would be protected from most development, the government of Kamchatka says. Their purpose would be to produce wild salmon -- for food, profit, recreation and scientific study, and as a genetic reserve of one of the world's most commercially and culturally important fish.
 If approved, the plans would push Russia toward the center of international efforts to prevent the remaining wild Pacific salmon stocks from suffering the declines and population crashes that have beset sturgeon, bluefin tuna and the Atlantic Ocean's salmon, halibut and cod. 
 ''Having weighed everything from the perspective of the economy, I have convinced myself that we have to have a different future, and that salmon must be allowed to return to spawn,'' said Aleksandr B. Chistyakov, Kamchatka's first deputy governor, in an interview in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the region's capital.
 Mr. Chistyakov said Kamchatka was selecting protection zones not to create wildlife reserves but because fish runs were the best foundation for the peninsula's economy. Oil, gas and mining sectors will be developed, he said, but will provide a comparably brief revenue stream. Sustainable fishing, he said, can last generations.
 The government's position, set forth in documents in August, has surprised even the scientists and conservationists who have lobbied to protect habitat from the development pressures of post-Soviet Russia. They have rallied behind it.
 ''This initiative is magnificent,'' said Dr. Dmitrij S. Pavlov, director of the A. N. Severtzov Institute of Ecology and Evolution at the Russian Academy of Sciences, in an interview here. ''It is important not only for people who live today, for contemporary people, but for future generations.''
 Andrei Klimenko, who directs programs on Kamchatka for the Wild Salmon Center, an Oregon-based organization working internationally to conserve salmon runs, said the proposal could become a milestone in the management of a beleaguered resource. ''It will be a precedent,'' he said. ''There is nothing else like this anywhere else.''
 Each year, Russian and American scientists say, a sixth to a quarter of the North Pacific's salmon originate in Kamchatka, a peninsula about the size of California.
 Its endurance as an engine of sea life is attributed to geography and politics. Until 15 years ago it was a closed Soviet military zone, untouched and almost without roads. Today, it remains a remote region of volcanoes and glaciers, ringed by forested slopes and tundra laced with aquatic habitats where salmon spawn and their young grow.
 Since Soviet authority evaporated, however, Kamchatka has faced intensifying pressures.
 Prospecting has begun, mines have been dug, roads have been cut and poaching -- from subsistence harvests to industrial-scale egg-stripping of salmon for caviar -- is nearly unchecked. There are plans to develop oil and gas wells offshore.
 Twice in the last two months the authorities have seized shipments of red Kamchatka caviar -- weighing 20 tons and 10 tons -- from airplanes landing at a Moscow airport.
 A few of the peninsula's salmon rivers are already depleted; others are at risk. ''We face a choice,'' said Olga A. Chernyagina, president of the Kamchatka League of Independent Experts, a Russian conservation group. ''Will there be salmon, or not?''
 Ms. Chernyagina said much could be lost, economically and socially. Estimates of the salmon fisheries' annual value range to $600 million, and Kamchatka's sea-run fish and their bright-red eggs are an important source of protein and employment for Russia and other nations.
 The peninsula is also a nearly mythical destination for outdoor tourism, a northern Amazon for volcano touring, heli-skiing, hiking, fishing, bird-watching and hunting.
 Mr. Chistyakov said that Kamchatka's wild state was its best asset, and that the rivers slated for protection were among its richest in fish yield and diversity. Dr. Jack A. Stanford, an ecology professor at the University of Montana and an adviser to the Wild Salmon Center, who, with Moscow State University, has helped direct research at biological stations on Kamchatka, agreed.
 One river, the Kol, he said, has as many as five million returning salmon each year. ''It has fish coming in from ice to ice,'' he said. ''It's an amazing place.''
 A recent tour of two rivers selected for protection, and helicopter flights over five others, showed a verdant wilderness.
 Rivers without dams fall from mountains and meander through tundra, creating networks of lakes and side-channels, dense plant communities and flood plains fertilized by decaying fish. Brown bears abound. Rare birds, including huge Steller's sea eagles, are a daily sight. At the Kol's mouth, where river meets surf, dozens of seals ambush passing fish.
 But in places, the banks are trampled by poachers and their camps. Treads from their all-terrain vehicles have cut scars in the tundra.
 The efforts to create salmon refuges formally began in 2001 when Kamchatka's administration, which governs the southern part the peninsula, signed a memorandum of understanding with the Wild Fishes and Biodiversity Foundation, a local conservation group, proposing the contiguous Kol and Kekhta basins as a protected zone.
 Later, the Koryak Autonomous Okrug, which governs the peninsula in the north, accepted a proposal to protect the contiguous Utkholok and Kvachina basins. After review and environmental assessment, Kamchatka designated the Kol and Kekhta in April -- 544,000 acres in all.
 Conservationists call the decision fresh thinking in a field in which huge sums have been spent on rivers, like the Columbia in the United States, trying to recover runs. The investments have had limited results.
 ''What makes this special is that these rivers are being protected while they are still amazing fish producers,'' Mr. Klimenko said. ''To preserve something that is not destroyed is much less expensive than restoring an ecosystem that is already broken.''
 The plans accelerated in August, when Kamchatka's administration wrote to the foundation unsolicited and proposed designating five more rivers. It asked the foundation to prepare surveys and assessments.
 The new proposal includes the Oblukovina, Krutogorova, Kolpakova, Opala and Zhupanova rivers. Under the plans, these watersheds would be protected from habitat disruption, but traditional uses would continue, including regulated commercial and sport fishing, trapping and hunting. Each river would have a biological station to study the ecology of the river and the fish.
 Vyacheslav Zvyagintsev, the foundation's director, said his staff was rushing to complete the documents. ''We have a fantastically difficult task,'' he said. ''But I always say: if not us, then who?''
 Mr. Chistyakov said Kamchatka planned to designate all the rivers except the Zhupanova by July 2007, when the Kamchatka and Koryak governments will merge, as part of the Kremlin's redistricting of Russia. The Zhupanova has more users and its designation needs more time, he said. (The Utkholok and Kvachina remain under review.)
 Even if the rivers are protected, some conservation advocates warn, the fish runs could remain at risk. Mr. Chistyakov noted that many Russians might not recognize protected zones. ''But I think this will change in time, and sooner rather than later,'' he said.
 The United Nations Development Program, which has a Kamchatka salmon conservation program, said poaching must also be reduced. It is drafting an antipoaching strategy it plans to release next year. Natalya Olofinskaya, a United Nations program officer, said the protected areas could help by putting scientists on the river who could deter and report poachers. ''By expanding this presence we could do a lot,'' she said.
 Russia is often criticized for behavior that includes crackdowns on democracy and the use of trade and energy levers against its neighbors. Its laws often prove malleable, subject to the whims of politicians or those in their favor. But in Kamchatka, advocates for salmon say the proposed protected zones are an example in which Russia is ahead of the United States, where many salmon runs and habitats were lost long ago.
 ''Russia is getting it right,'' Dr. Stanford said, on the bank of the Utkholok, a river of salmon bones and big, silver-sided fish. ''And we got it wrong.''

HEADLINE: Peacekeeper Commander Mired in Afghan Combat 

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Oct. 14 

 BODY:
Leaning against the red webbing that passes for upholstery in a military aircraft, Lt. Gen. David Richards, the British commander of NATO troops in Afghanistan, scanned a press clip as he flew back to the capital from Kandahar, the center of combat operations in the south.
 The article was by a well-known British columnist who had written in The Guardian that he was ''baffled by Richards's naivete about the Taliban.'' The author, Simon Jenkins, contended that NATO could not possibly win against an enemy that could ''count on the tacit support of tens of thousands of fighters from tribal militias.''
''I am not naive; he's naive,'' General Richards shouted over the roar of the plane engines. He dismissed as ''nonsense'' the idea that the surge by the Taliban across southern Afghanistan this year was driven by ideology or Pashtun tribal grievances. 
 ''This is not a huge popular uprising,'' he added, bristling. ''And to distort the truth is so unjust for the people here who want us. And it is unhelpful since it undermines the fabric of what we are doing.'' 
 ''People do not want a return to the Taliban,'' he said, ''but we need time to allow that aspiration to win.'' 
 Already half through his one-year command in Afghanistan, General Richards, 54, does not have much time.
 He now commands the 31,000 troops of the International Security Assistance Force, including 12,000 American troops, spread across the whole country. 
 The British general, who has led NATO's most elite fighting force, the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, since 2001, served three tours in Northern Ireland, and was commander of British peacekeeping forces three times -- in East Timor in 1999 and twice in Sierra Leone in 2000. 
 When he arrived in Afghanistan in February, he talked like a peacekeeper, too, emphasizing the need to improve security so reconstruction and development projects could take root, to extend the government's reach, and to win hearts and minds. 
 He vowed to do things differently than the Americans. He said that NATO soldiers would treat detainees in a transparent way, respect Islam and Afghan culture, and raid houses only if necessary.
 But the general was quickly forced to put many of those plans aside and engage in hard fighting, not least to show the insurgents, and the wavering local population, that his troops were a force to be reckoned with. 
 Even before he took command of the turbulent south, Taliban insurgents were swarming in numbers not seen since 2001. General Richards estimates that his troops now face 4,000 to 5,000 Taliban fighters. 
 The summer months were consumed by heavy fighting. The general's forces came under repeated attacks, both on patrol and at their bases, forcing NATO to call in air and artillery strikes that inevitably killed scores of the very civilians he was trying to win over. It was not exactly the hearts-and-minds strategy he had planned. Still, the general insists his forces were fully ready: they had spent nine months preparing for the mission, because the NATO deployment was delayed by several months. 
 ''We knew there was a lot of opposition,'' he said, this time in an interview in his headquarters in Kabul, set between the United States Embassy and the presidential palace. ''We had been watching it, and the Americans were very forthcoming with their intelligence.''
 ''There were doubts about NATO and our ability to conduct demanding security operations,'' he said. ''There are no questions about our ability now.'' 
 The fighting was regrettable, but necessary, he added. ''We've killed, sadly -- because in many respects some of them are just unemployed young Afghan men who need employment and are paid cynically by the Taliban to do their dirty stuff for them.
 ''But we have killed many hundreds of Taliban in the last month, chiefly in Kandahar and Helmand, and it has put paid to any doubt in anyone's mind that NATO can do what we were sent here to do.''
 Recently, there have, indeed, been some successes. Not least, his forces regained control of Panjwai, a district just 15 miles west of Kandahar, the main southern city, where the Taliban had gathered in large numbers. The victory was vital for its strategic and psychological impact, the general said. 
 ''The Taliban were very cocky about Panjwai,'' he said on his visit to Kandahar during the operation. ''They think they can face us down. We will prove to them that they are defeatable. It's very important for people to see that happening, and the rather worried atmospherics will change overnight.'' 
 The general says that about 10 percent of the population in the south may support the Taliban, that 20 percent are opposed to them, and that the rest are stuck in the middle. 
 ''They are straightforward, simple folk who above all want security for their family, and they will go with whichever side can convince them they are going to win,'' he said. ''And that 70 percent must not be allowed to slip into the hands of the Taliban this autumn.'' 
 That will mean rolling out tangible benefits -- in the form of assistance -- as soon as security allows, he said. 
 ''It's a very important psychological, physical, military and wider campaign that we are conducting, and I think this autumn is a critical period,'' he said. ''And that's my main focus at the moment, getting those visible improvements, in security, governance and reconstruction and development to start happening in the south so that we can persuade that 70 percent that we will win.''
 Yet in his time in Afghanistan, General Richards has seen up close just how weak and ill equipped the Afghan government is to handle a crisis, like the riots that broke out in Kabul after an American military truck plowed into civilian cars, killing at least four people, in May. 
 He also found a startling lack of coordination among the government, the military and foreign donors, which he described as ''anarchy'' in his first weeks on the job.
 He set to work to help President Hamid Karzai form a kind of privy council to convene crucial ministers and security officials, as well as United States and NATO commanders and ambassadors of leading donor countries, the United Nations and European Union. Called the Policy Action Group, it meets weekly and is designed to bring badly needed coordination to security and aid efforts.
 ''It's a pretty powerful structure,'' said one NATO official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity and who credited General Richards with the idea. ''This is his war cabinet; this is the bit he never had.''
 There is still a long way to go. He talks of the need to combat corruption, replace bad government officials and persuade international donors to drop their lengthy procedures and tendering rules to help reconstruction aid flow.
 ''I am not giving the rosy picture,'' he said on the military flight. ''I'll be honest. There's a lot to do.''

HEADLINE: Wallflower at the Web Party

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

 BODY:
JONATHAN ABRAMS was in a spot. He could take the safe bet and accept the $30 million that Google was offering him for Friendster, the social networking Web start-up he began only a year earlier, in 2002. Saying yes to Google would provide a quick and stunning payout for relatively little work and instantly place the Friendster Web site in front of hundreds of millions of users across the globe.
 But at the same time, some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley were lobbying Mr. Abrams, a computer programmer, to reject Google's offer. America Online had offered the two founders of Yahoo a few million dollars each in the mid-90's for their Web site -- and both became billionaires because they said no. Sell us a stake in your company for $13 million, the advisers told Mr. Abrams, and we will help build Friendster into an online powerhouse worth hundreds of millions -- if not billions -- of dollars.
''It really didn't take much persuading,'' said Russell L. Siegelman, a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which has poured around $10 million into Friendster since November 2003. ''Jonathan clearly wanted to go for it.'' 
 Go for it, he did. Mr. Abrams spurned Google's advances and charted his own course. In retrospect, he should have taken the $30 million. If Google had paid him in stock, Mr. Abrams would easily be worth $1 billion today, according to one person close to Google. And with Google's ample resources, Friendster might have solidified its position as the pioneering front-runner in social networking. Instead, Mr. Abrams has the distinction of founding a company that is shorthand for potential unmet. 
 Roughly once a week, David L. Sze, a venture capitalist at Greylock Partners, hears from entrepreneurs who say they have the next MySpace, the copycat social networking site that has trounced Friendster. ''The counter to that is, 'Tell me why you aren't going to be the next Friendster,' '' Mr. Sze said. ''It's become the iconic case of failure.''
 Reality must smack even harder just after the blockbuster deal in which Google agreed to pay $1.65 billion for YouTube, the video-sharing Web site that has yet to celebrate its first anniversary or its first profits. Friendster essentially created the social networking sector three years ago by offering users a site where they could browse profiles posted by friends and the friends of friends in search of dates and playmates. But so badly did Friendster fumble its early lead that, as of last month, it ranked 14th among all social networking sites tracked by comScore Media Metrix, trailing even myYearbook.com, a site started last year by a 16-year-old high school student.
 It is not too late for Mr. Abrams and his investors to see a handsome payout from Friendster, a well-known brand in a nascent business sector. But why and how Friendster missed the mark is a salutary Silicon Valley tale so instructive that Mikolaj Jan Piskorski, an assistant professor at the Harvard Business School, uses the company's inglorious fall as a case study in his strategy classes.
 Friendster's fate is ''a real puzzle,'' Professor Piskorski said. ''This was a company that had the talent and had the connections.'' he said. ''They had this great idea that people really took to.''
 There is no single reason that explains Friendster's failures, Professor Piskorski added, which is what makes it academic fodder. ''It's a power story,'' he said. ''It's a status story. It's an ego story.'' But largely, he said, Friendster is a ''very Silicon Valley story that tells us a lot about how the Valley operates.''
 EVERY good Silicon Valley start-up story needs an engaging tale about its founding. The YouTube boys -- Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim -- supposedly conjured up the idea of a video-sharing product almost by accident, after a late-night dinner party. (That, at least, is the way two of the three founders tell it.) Earlier, Larry Page and Sergey Brin decided to start Google after Yahoo declined to buy their search technology -- for a paltry $1.6 million. Mr. Abrams drew his inspiration to create Friendster from a broken heart brought on by a failed relationship and the eternal lures of the mating dance.
 ''Basically, Jonathan wanted to meet girls,'' said Mark J. Pincus, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who provided Mr. Abrams with some of the seed money to finance his project at the end of 2002. ''He told me himself, he started Friendster as a way to surf through his friends' address books for good-looking girls.''
 The second half of the 1990's had seen any number of failed social networking sites, including forgotten enterprises like Six Degrees and SocialNet. ''We all basically hit the market several years before the market was ready for social networking,'' said Reid G. Hoffman, the founding chief executive of SocialNet and an early investor in Friendster.
 Mr. Abrams, though, had perfect timing. Friendster made its Web debut in March 2003, and though it was then a speck of a start-up that spent no money on marketing, it signed up three million registered users by the fall. Publications including Time, Esquire, Vanity Fair, Entertainment Weekly, US Weekly and Spin were writing about Friendster before anyone had heard of MySpace. So popular was Friendster in those early days that Mr. Abrams appeared on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live'' -- and then boasted that the Yahoo founders had never been guests on a late-night television talk show.
 ''Jonathan is very much an acquired taste,'' said Larissa Le, a former Friendster employee and longtime friend of Mr. Abrams. ''He's your typical engineer from the Valley who can come off as very arrogant.'' For a time Mr. Abrams, then in his early 30's, cut a high profile in the Valley, showing up regularly at parties with a strikingly attractive woman on each arm and his head in the stars.
 His fellow entrepreneurs might have shaken their heads over the size of Mr. Abrams's ballooning ego, but they also could not deny that he had invented something significant at an opportune moment, when the area was still struggling to shake off its post-bubble doldrums. 
 The list of venture capitalists enticing him to say no to Google and to go it alone included John Doerr, the legendary venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins whose list of greatest hits includes Google, Netscape and Amazon.com, and Bob Kagle, the Benchmark Capital partner who first spotted eBay.
 Andrew L. Anker, a former venture capitalist who is now a top executive at Six Apart, a popular blogging company that considered buying Friendster last year, said he recalled Mr. Abrams's quandary. ''Jonathan had the Google offer,'' he said, ''but he also had these very-well-regarded V.C.'s saying, 'Let's make this thing huge.' ''
 It did not take much to convince him. Mr. Abrams, a former engineer at Netscape, is a byproduct of the Valley, an environment finely calibrated to create monster-sized companies. ''There aren't thousands of V.C.'s running around Silicon Valley to fund a company just to flip it for a quick payout,'' Mr. Anker said. ''The Valley is all about making things huge.''
 Mr. Doerr and Mr. Kagle took seats on Friendster's board, as did another investor, Timothy A. Koogle, who had been the chief executive of Yahoo through the second half of the 1990's. Other investors included Peter A. Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal, which eBay bought for $1.5 billion in 2002, and K. Ram Shriram, one of the first investors in Google and perhaps the most-sought-after angel investor in Silicon Valley. In turn, this gold-plated group helped to recruit to Friendster an equally impressive cadre of top executives and computer programmers.
 Back in late 2003, Mr. Abrams spoke of the all-star cast that had joined him at Friendster the way a Yankee fan might boast about the Murderer's Row that George Steinbrenner assembles each year in pursuit of another World Series ring. Now, however, Mr. Abrams casts that same board -- then composed primarily of men in their 50's who were far older than the site's target demographic -- and the recruits they drafted as the main cause of Friendster's great stumble.
 Through a colleague from a previous tech start-up, Melissa Gilbert, Mr. Abrams declined to comment for this article, saying he was too busy working on a new start-up to talk about the past. Ms. Gilbert, though, who described herself as the first investor in Friendster, echoed the comments of others close to Mr. Abrams, who has loudly proclaimed that he will never again accept a dime in venture capital. Mr. Abrams believed that he had developed a sound business plan for building Friendster into an Internet powerhouse -- and that the plan foundered when his well-known investors shoved him aside and proceeded to mess everything up, Ms. Gilbert wrote in an e-mail message.
 ''Friendster ended up with three levels of V.P.'s, C.E.O.'s and board members who, although they had great resumes, they were not connected to the social networking concept and didn't really use Friendster,'' she wrote.
 Mr. Doerr, at Kleiner Perkins, disputed this. He said that he visited the Friendster site at least once a day. ''It's certainly not fair to say we were out of touch when we were willing to commit millions of dollars to this market,'' he said. ''We understood the opportunity. The company didn't seize that opportunity.''
 But Mr. Siegelman, one of Mr. Doerr's partners at Kleiner Perkins, said Mr. Abrams had a point. The original board had little feel for the product, said Mr. Siegelman, who attended most meetings and eventually replaced Mr. Doerr. But Mr. Siegelman also described Mr. Abrams as a founder in way over his head, which is why, in April 2004, only a few months after investing in the company, the board replaced him as chief executive.
 ''All of a sudden Jonathan had all these high-powered investors to please,'' Mr. Siegelman said. ''He had all this money in the bank, so there was all this pressure to hire people and get things done. Open up new territories: China, Japan, Germany. Add all these new features. Meantime, he took his eye off the ball.''
 But the board also lost sight of the task at hand, according to Kent Lindstrom, an early investor in Friendster and one of its first employees. As Friendster became more popular, its overwhelmed Web site became slower. Things would become so bad that a Friendster Web page took as long as 40 seconds to download. Yet, from where Mr. Lindstrom sat, technical difficulties proved too pedestrian for a board of this pedigree. The performance problems would come up, but the board devoted most of its time to talking about potential competitors and new features, such as the possibility of adding Internet phone services, or so-called voice over Internet protocol, or VoIP, to the site.
 ''THE stars would never sit back and say, 'We really have to make this thing work,' '' recalled Mr. Lindstrom, who is now president of Friendster. ''They were talking about the next thing. Voice over Internet. Making Friendster work in different languages. Potential big advertising deals. Yet we didn't solve the first basic problem: our site didn't work.''
 In retrospect, Mr. Lindstrom said, the company needed to devote all of its resources to fixing its technological problems. But such are the appetites of companies fixated on growing into multibillion-dollar behemoths. They seek to run even before they can walk. 
 ''Friendster was so focused on becoming the next Google,'' Professor Piskorski said, ''that they weren't focused on fixing the more mundane problems standing in the way of them becoming the next Google.''
 The board replaced Mr. Abrams with one of its own, Mr. Koogle, the former chief executive of Yahoo. But Mr. Koogle served only three months, a temporary caretaker who showed up at the office only sporadically, former Friendster employees said. The board next chose a television industry executive, Scott M. Sassa, to replace Mr. Koogle. That selection might have made sense if the company had been in position to start cutting big advertising deals. But it was not, given that its Web site was not up to speed. Mr. Sassa left after less than a year, which was nearly twice the tenure of his successor, Taek Kwan, who left at the end of 2005, six months after he started.
 ''After a while all the changes really wear on you,'' said Jeff Winner, who served under three chief executives in just 12 months as the head of the company's troubled engineering team. ''Every C.E.O. represented a change of direction, and when a company changes direction, the engineers really get jerked around.'' 
 Mr. Winner left at the end of 2004, he said, ''because like a lot of people I no longer believed Friendster was on a course for massive success.''
 People inside the company recognized that they needed to add new features to the site if it was to compete with the new crop of copycat sites trying to cash in on Friendster's early success.
 ''There really wasn't much to do once you set up your network and found your old friends,'' said Ms. Le, one of several people who could describe themselves as a former product manager at Friendster. Other social networking sites, including MySpace, were adding features like blogs and tools that people could use to jazz up their profiles. But adding new features to Friendster would only slow down the site further.
 ''People had great ideas all the time,'' Mr. Lindstrom said, ''but it always boiled down to, 'O.K., but first let's get the basic thing working.' ''
 ONE of the good ideas, Mr. Doerr said, was to encourage users to organize around favorite bands -- the very idea that proved so crucial to MySpace's success. 
 ''We completely failed to execute,'' Mr. Doerr said. ''Everything boiled down to our inability to improve performance.''
 People inside Friendster were closely monitoring MySpace, which was founded by a pair of Los Angeles music aficionados in the fall of 2003, inspired by Friendster's early success. MySpace would have been hard to ignore, given its phenomenal traffic growth starting in early 2004.
 ''I was giving people regular updates on MySpace,'' said Jim Scheinman, who served as Friendster's head of business development from October 2003 until leaving in May 2005 to work at a social networking rival, Bebo.com. ''But a lot of people refused to take them seriously.''
 Many people working at Friendster sneered at MySpace. The holy grail at Friendster -- and the cause of most of its technical problems -- was its closed system: users at Friendster could view only the profiles of those on a relatively short chain of acquaintances. By contrast, MySpace was open, and therefore much simpler from a technological standpoint; anybody could look at anyone else's profile. 
 The two companies also mirrored their founders: where Friendster reflected the ordered vision of its engineer-founder -- early on, the company famously removed the profiles of people who put up joke pictures, like photographs of their dogs in place of themselves -- MySpace was more L.A.-laid back. At MySpace, they rode the wave instead of fighting it, and encouraged users to do pretty much as they pleased.
 Besides, those behind Friendster were so convinced that they were destined to be the next big thing that they instead fixated on the actions of their presumed peers -- at least that is Mr. Siegelman's recollection. ''I remember going to these board meetings and feeling disgusted,'' he said. ''Half of every board meeting was taken up by a discussion of what Google's going to do, or Yahoo.''
 Today, MySpace has more than 50 times the number of monthly domestic visitors as Friendster, according to comScore Media Metrix. The social networking offerings of Yahoo and Google are also tiny when their American audiences are compared with that of the market leader: MySpace's audience is 10 times as big as Yahoo 360, and 200 times that of Orkut, Google's answer to Friendster. 
 Last fall, Friendster hired an investment banker to shop the company around. In part, the board was inspired by the $580 million that Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation agreed in July 2005 to pay for Intermix Media and its primary asset, MySpace. In the end, though, the investors failed to find a suitor willing to pay even $20 million for the company.
 Friendster was nearly out of cash by the end of last year. It had halved its payroll, to 25 employees, and advertising was hard to come by on a site that, three years after its debut, still did not work right. The venture capitalists considered shutting down the company. But a sense of obligation (''It was my feeling that the investors and the board had done something of a disservice to Friendster,'' Mr. Siegelman said) and economics (Friendster still had a well-known brand and millions of registered users, even if most had not visited the site in some time) prompted Kleiner Perkins, Benchmark and some of the private investors to sink an additional $3 million into the company at the start of 2006.
 THE venture capitalists reconstructed the board -- ''I took all the 50-year-old white guys off,'' said Mr. Siegelman, who is white and 44 -- and put Mr. Lindstrom, who had been with the company since mid-2003, in charge. The company hired yet another chief of engineering, who laid down the law: at least 80 percent of his people would work on performance and stability issues until the Web site worked as well as it should.
 ''In the past, we had often chosen the more exotic solution over the more simple solution,'' Mr. Lindstrom said. Trailblazing a new field like social networking was enough of a challenge. ''But we were also trying to innovate on the tech side as well,'' he said. The company finally licked its performance problems this last summer, Mr. Lindstrom said.
 The team now running Friendster valiantly soldiers on, hoping that it can position the company as a site for an older demographic group -- people 25 to 40 -- who do not have the time or inclination to spend hours each day on MySpace. 
 Now the challenge, Mr. Lindstrom said, is ''to focus on a market for more than two months.'' A second challenge is figuring out ways to cash in on its popularity overseas. Three quarters of Friendster's users live outside the United States, mainly in the Philippines, Malaysia and other, smaller southeast Asian countries. 
 ''In the past we've seen that as a problem,'' Mr. Lindstrom said, ''but now we see this as a huge opportunity.''
 The investors apparently are satisfied with this new, less ambitious version of Friendster. In the summer, they sank another $10 million into the company.
 ''Friendster missed the chance to become a multibillion-dollar company,'' said Mr. Thiel, the PayPal co-founder who has continued to invest in Friendster. ''But I still see a lot of opportunity here.''
 Mr. Doerr added: ''There are plenty of second acts in American business.''

HEADLINE: Voters' Allegiances, Ripe for the Picking

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

 BODY:
IN May 1980, the pollster Richard Wirthlin huddled with his presidential candidate, Ronald Reagan, to plot a course through what looked like a daunting landscape for their party. Just over half the country told pollsters that they were Democrats or leaned that way, compared with just 30 percent that said they were Republicans -- a gap that had held steady more or less since the New Deal. 
 The rest is political history. By winning over millions of white working-class Democrats, Mr. Reagan cut that gap in half and ushered in 26 years of Republican dominance at the voting booth.
 Now, on the eve of the midterm elections, surveys show mounting impatience with both the war in Iraq and Republican rule. Some political analysts -- including Mr. Wirthlin -- say they see a chance for a potential Democratic comeback, an opportunity for another historic realignment of the political parties. 
 ''I would not be surprised,'' Mr. Wirthlin said, noting a small slip in the number of voters who say they lean Republican combined with an unusual spike in the number who reject both major parties. 
 In recent Harris Interactive polls, the number of respondents who refuse to acknowledge a preference for either party has risen to about 25 percent of the electorate from about 12 percent for most of the last decade. 
 Much of this increase in independents, he said, is probably accounted for by former Republican voters not quite willing to say they lean Democratic, but also unlikely to turn out this year.
 ''It is a red flag that Republican politicians need to watch,'' Mr. Wirthlin said. Although Republicans have long outperformed Democrats at turning out their voters, he added, ''this year they may be raking water up a hill.''
 Dramatic shifts in political allegiance are clear only in retrospect and hard to foresee. The White House strategist Karl Rove long predicted that President George W. Bush would cement a Republican majority that could govern Washington for decades.
 On the other side, Ruy Teixeira, a Democratic pollster, and John B. Judis, a liberal journalist, responded with their 2002 book, ''The Emerging Democratic Majority,'' published just months before the Republicans defied history to enlarge their majorities in the midterm elections. There are reasons to consider a Democratic resurgence a long shot. No Democratic presidential candidate has won a clear majority of the national vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976, in the aftermath of Watergate. President Clinton won with pluralities, thanks in part to the third-party candidacy of H. Ross Perot in both elections. And in the first midterm of his presidency, in 1994, Democrats lost decisively in the battle for control of the House, which reflects national political trends more closely than the Senate. 
 Still, polls showing Democrats poised for big gains this fall in both chambers of Congress are reigniting the debate: Can Democrats crack apart the Reagan coalition of white blue-collar workers, evangelical Protestants, Southerners and chambers of commerce? Or will shifts in population toward the outer suburbs, the South and the West combine with the Democrats' secular, liberal Northeastern image to keep the party a minority in national elections for years to come? 
 At the heart of the debate is the war in Iraq, which pollsters on both sides agree is the biggest factor propelling Democratic hopes for the fall. 
 To many analysts, the backlash against the war is an inevitable and transient reaction that could fade when the Republicans pick a new standard-bearer in 2008. John Mark Hansen, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, said every conflict since the Mexican-American War has hurt the president's popularity and cost his party in midterm elections. Even in 1942, less than a year after Pearl Harbor, the Democrats lost 45 seats in the House and 9 in the Senate -- during ''the good war'' and at the start of what turned out to be their party's ascendance.
 Democrats, though, argue that Iraq may be singular. No other fight has been so closely associated with one party or its leader. None has been justified with arguments that crumbled as quickly as the suspicions of weapons of mass destruction or an Iraq-Qaeda tie. And the war's end, for now, remains far out of sight.
 ''Iraq has the potential to be to the Republican Party on national security what the Depression was to the Republican Party on economics,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
 The Democrats' hope is that the war changes the reputations of the two parties in a way that may ultimately lead to remaking their constituencies as well, just as Roosevelt's New Deal formed a lasting bond with union members and urban immigrants. President Johnson's Great Society programs, on the other hand, eventually delivered the South to the Republicans by linking the Democrats to civil rights and liberalism -- a gradual shift that reached a sudden tipping point with Mr. Reagan's election. By tarnishing the Republican image of greater competence in foreign affairs, Democrats say, the war could open new inroads for their party among the white working-class voters who have voted Republican since the Reagan days.
 White voters without a college degree make up about half the electorate, according to the census. And Democrats have long contended that those voters should be the natural constituency for their party's brand of economic populism.
 But the white working class has voted overwhelmingly for Republicans since Reagan. President Bush widened the Republican advantage among such voters from a margin of 17 percentage points in 2000 to 23 percentage points in 2004, according to exit poll data compiled by Mr. Teixeira, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation. 
 One reason for the Republican edge with those voters, many pollsters say, has been the party's reputation as the one that shares their values, especially those of traditionally religious Christians. But another major factor has been national security. By two to one, voters in 2004 trusted Mr. Bush over his Democratic opponent, Senator John Kerry, to handle terrorist threats. Now, that security edge has all but disappeared. Among white voters with no college education, approval of the president's handling of the war on terrorism had plummeted from a margin of 22 percentage points the summer of 2004 to just 7 percentage points last week, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll. 
 And the Republican advantage as the party that shares voters' ''moral values'' declined from 12 percentage points to only 5 points -- within the poll's margin of error. (Several polls show that voters also now favor the Democrats to manage the war and the economy.)
 ''Iraq is the squandering of the national security premium the Republicans have been living on,'' Mr. Teixeira said. The Republicans' failure at ''standing up'' to foreign threats, he argued, had diminished their credibility on a whole cluster of ''values'' issues like ''standing up for what is right'' as well. 
 That, he contended, is vindicating his argument for a Democratic ascendance: if the Democrats can cut their margin of defeat among white workers, they can build a durable national majority from their coalition of professionals, women, African-Americans and the fast-growing Hispanic population. Although Mr. Bush's popularity with Hispanics at one time threatened to dislodge them from the Democratic bloc, the Republican moves this year to build a wall along the Mexican border has effectively pushed them back. 
 ''That is fatal,'' Mr. Teixeira said. 
 Turning momentary popularity into a more lasting majority, of course, takes more than a midterm election. For one thing, voters typically develop a party preference based on the political atmosphere at the time they come of age and grow more attached to that party over the course of their lives. The voters who came of age in the 1930's, for example, have remained the most solidly Democratic. Fifty-seven percent are Democrats and only 38 percent are Republican, according to the American National Election Study.
 Recent surveys and exit polls suggest that the Democrats have regained the upper hand among the young voters who entered the electorate over the last 15 years, and political scientists say dismay at the Iraq war is likely to prolong that trend.
 ''The longer Bush's approval ratings stay in the mid-30's, the more lost young Republicans there will be in the next generation,'' said Donald P. Green, a political scientist at Yale. But by the same rule, voters who came of age in the Reagan era are reliably Republican. Voters around the age of 36 are the only age group in which Republicans outnumber Democrats, according to 2006 surveys by the Pew Research Center. And it will be decades before they pass through the populace, ''like an elephant through a boa constrictor,'' Professor Hansen said.
 The true political consequence of the Iraq war also remains to be seen. American voters may hate wars, but they also favor candidates who take a muscular approach to foreign affairs, Professor Green said. Since the Vietnam-era peace movement, Democrats have had a reputation as peaceniks. It has cost them votes, especially among white working-class men and especially since the Reagan era. Unless Iraq leads to a new caution about military force, the war may not do much to change that.
 ''The usual card the Democrats would play would be 'get out of war,' '' Professor Green said. ''That just reinforces it.''
 Others argue that the travails of the Bush administration will be less transformative than the Democrats hope. ''In the Depression, birth rates plunged way down,'' said Michael Barone, a political analyst. ''They stopped having sex. They put their kids to bed hungry. In my opinion, the Iraq war is not that kind of event.''
 ''If the Republicans suffer losses, it is a negative verdict on competence rather than ideology,'' he continued. ''If you look at domestic issues, what are the Democrats talking about? The minimum wage is the first thing they mention, and it is a 1938 law.''
 Mr. Barone, who is associated with the theory of a lasting Republican majority, argued that essential elements remained unchanged. The party is strongest in the regions with the highest growth rates -- the South and West -- and it dominates 97 of the 100 fastest growing counties in the country, mostly booming ''exurbs'' on the outskirts of cities. 
 And whatever happens in Iraq, little has changed to the Democrats' reputation as the party of secular, elite liberals.
 ''Next to race, church attendance is the strongest correlation with voting,'' said Michael Dimock, associate director of the Pew Research Center. ''America remains very religious. A lot of people tell us that someone who does not believe in God is not an acceptable candidate for president. Anything but that.''
 What's more, Democrats will need solutions to capitalize on their opportunity, said Professor Jack Pitney Jr. of Claremont McKenna College.
 ''Franklin Roosevelt had a clear answer, a very specific program, the New Deal,'' he said. ''Do the Democrats have the same kind of clear answer to Iraq? It is damaging to Republicans, but it is hard to see how it is constructive to Democrats.''
 Still, Mr. Wirthlin, puzzling at Republican troubles even in a relatively prosperous economy, pointed to Sept. 11. 
 ''Foreign policy took on a different and darker edge with the destruction of the twin towers,'' Mr. Wirthlin said. ''My assumption is that was a mega-event that refocused people politically from 'myself and my neighbor and getting a job' to 'how are we doing in the world?' '' 
 And at the moment that has meant an even greater focus on the war in Iraq, he said, turning what was once the Republicans greatest strength into a major liability.

HEADLINE: You Can Complain, or You Can Make Money 

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THERE is extreme income inequality in this country. It is hard to say whether it's the fault of President Bush, since there was also extreme income inequality under former President Bill Clinton, and in fact there has always been extreme income inequality. 
 Just to give you an idea of current inequality, statistically speaking, the top 1 percent of all income earners in this great land earn roughly 20 percent of the total income. The top 1 percent of wealth holders have close to one-third of all wealth. The top 5 percent of wealth holders have very roughly 50 percent of all wealth in this country.
As you can see, that does not leave a lot for everyone else.
 There are a number of ways to respond to this situation. You can become indignant and say that it's a violation of American democratic principles. This is a good way to put yourself into a sanctimonious mood, and it offers some psychic satisfaction. 
 I'm not sure that there is any historical basis, though, for believing that the founders of the nation wanted everyone to have equal wages. Certainly, many of them were wealthy men, and the Father of Our Country was said to be the wealthiest man in the colonies from his land and slave holdings. But, again, if you want to be exercised about inequality, you'll have plenty of company.
 Another way, possibly more satisfying in the long run, would be to ask yourself how the top 1 percent of wealth holders and income earners got to be that way, and then to try to do it yourself. My own observation, having been both a critic and a moderately well-paid person, is that while it's nice to be a critic, it's also nice to have your own swimming pool. (The best is both, but that's another story.)
 In other words, look at two recent business stories and decide which side of them you want to be on. Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman of Viacom, recently fired the company's chief executive, Tom Freston. Mr. Freston was a pioneer at MTV, immensely well liked -- people on the Paramount lot literally wept when he said good-bye -- but Mr. Redstone decided that he had to go because he had not done a good job for the stockholders and the stock had languished. 
 In the last paragraph of an article about his departure, The Wall Street Journal dryly noted that Mr. Freston's severance package would be about $60 million and his pay this year was about $20 million.
 An even more recent story has been about Brian Hunter, a commodities trader for the large hedge fund called Amaranth Advisors. Mr. Hunter made big bets in natural gas trades and had been getting good returns for his investors. Then the market turned against him and he lost roughly $6 billion -- yes, billion -- for his investors within a few weeks. He's no longer at Amaranth, and the fund is being dissolved. However, it was noted that his pay for 2005 would have been between $75 million and $100 million. Yes, you read it right.
 That is, Tom Freston, an undeniably great guy, gets $60 million for leading a company whose stock performance was deemed unacceptably poor (although it's been good lately). Brian Hunter is presumably still a wealthy man despite leading his investors to disaster.
 You can be furious about that, and you should be. But you might also think how nice it would be to make that kind of money, or even a small fraction of that sort of wage.
 For students slogging their way through school, here are the merest hints of how you can and cannot reach that top 1 percent, that place where you are paid well even if you make mistakes:
 You do not get to it by studying African feminism in the 19th century, whether or not you are at an Ivy League college. You do not get to it by studying Bulgarian poetry. You do not get to it by any field of endeavor or study that is esoteric and has no connection with helping other people either become healthy or make money.
 You do not get to it by being a civil servant unless you are the kind of civil servant -- say, a cabinet member or a United States Senator -- who can use his or her connections later to lobby for well-heeled clients. You do not get to it by a lifetime of work in any field in which there are government price caps on earnings.
 You do get to it by working in fields in which you can fix your wages, preferably with the government's help. These include law, where you need a license to practice, and thereby can lift yourself out of working for free-market wages. (Everyone in this country pays homage to the free market, but no one wants to work for free-market wages.) They also include medicine, where a far more difficult license is required, and where desperate patients will pay almost anything to look and feel good. They also include accounting at the C.P.A. level.
 You are always better off working in a field where torrents of money are sloshing through and you can grab a handful as it goes by. That means Wall Street. Finance is the ultimate great business. (Warren E. Buffett famously said that you are always better off being mediocre in a great business than great in a mediocre business, and he easily could have been talking about Wall Street.) Money pours through Wall Street in vast oceans. Even if you take off a tiny helping, you are going to wind up in that 1 percent. If you can do the daily double and work on Wall Street and be in a position to fix your own wage -- say, by being in high management at a major Wall Street firm that has such prestige and connections that it can control its fees and other compensation -- you will wind up living a great life, at least money-wise. (It is very difficult in many other ways, and I do not envy the people who do it. The tension is just far too much for little me.)
 You make money by making money for people who already have money. This is another reason finance is such a well-paid field. One good day's work for a man who has a $100 million account you are trading is worth far more than a lifetime's work at the checkout counter at Wal-Mart. Yet, amazingly, managing wealthy people's money is far less difficult and stressful than checking out customers at Wal-Mart. It's not even close. As my smart sister Rachel says, you make money by making money. It's tricky, but it's right.
 You make money by learning skills that lead to any of these: making people feel and look better, learning how to draw their wills, learning how to manage their money so they don't underperform the bogey terribly, learning how to make complex things like computer parts in ways that lead your employer to make money and reward you with stock options. This is by no means an exclusive list. You also make it by manufacturing cardboard boxes and selling scrap metals. But usually, education in finance, medicine, law, accounting, electrical engineering -- something in which you learn to add value instead of having fun in school -- is the key.
 YOU can try to get into that 1 percent by acting, playing drums or shooting hoops. That rarely works. The sure way is to learn skills that allow you to help make money for other people (or that give them the illusion you're doing that) or make them feel better (or that give the illusion of doing that on national television).
 But if you are not one of these people -- if you feel better making pottery or teaching school or policing the streets -- you can have a fabulous life, too. In fact, from what I have seen, you can have a better life if you just stop thinking that everyone is supposed to make the same wage and just feel happy with who you are. 
 Or, with apologies to the big dogs at Goldman Sachs, and quoting the genius Bob Dylan, ''I mean no harm, nor put fault, on anyone that lives in a vault, but it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him.'' But if you do want to please that inner him, now you have an idea of how to do it.

HEADLINE: Tobacco Company To Stay in State 

BYLINE: By JEFF HOLTZ

 BODY:
UST Inc., which announced in August that it would leave its Greenwich headquarters and possibly the state, said last Monday that it would remain in lower Fairfield County. 
 On Oct. 5, Gov. M. Jodi Rell reached an agreement with UST, a smokeless tobacco and wine company, to remain in the state. Under the deal, Mrs. Rell guaranteed the company a $3 million low-interest loan and $950,000 in tax credits. The company would also be reimbursed for 80 percent of its local taxes for five years if it moved to an economic enterprise zone designated by the state. The only enterprise zones in lower Fairfield County are in Norwalk and Stamford, according to the state's Office of Business and Industry Development.
 ''Securing this agreement not only saves 350 professional jobs, but also ensures a company with a long tradition of civic spirit can continue to be an anchor in the region,'' Mrs. Rell said in a statement.
 Michael G. Vazinet, a company spokesman, said UST had been in Greenwich since 1970. He said that the company did not know when it would move and that it planned to put the Greenwich property up for sale within 90 days. 
 ''There's a lot of value locked up in the Greenwich facility that we'll be able to unlock for our shareholders,'' Mr. Vazinet said. ''That's a main motivator for us.'' JEFF HOLTZ

HEADLINE: Thinking Boldly in Stamford

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

DATELINE: STAMFORD 

 BODY:
THE developers strutting their stuff along the boulevards that crisscross this city's downtown represent some of the most prominent names in the trade.
 Lowe Enterprises, a national development company based in Los Angeles; W&M Properties, a New York real estate management firm affilated with the owner of the Empire State Building; and Donald J. Trump are backing projects that could bring some 1,100 residential units, 325,000 square feet of office space and 140,000 square feet of retailing to the downtown area in the next few years.
Yet these projects are overshadowed by what Michael Freimuth, the city's economic development director, calls ''the 800-pound gorilla'' proposed by a lesser-known entity, Antares Investment Partners.
 Its $3.5 billion plan to revitalize the city's underused South End over 10 years covers ''easily a third of the real estate in that neighborhood,'' Mr. Freimuth said, adding that the site's prime location on a peninsula on Long Island Sound and within walking distance of the city's transportation center ''makes it seem even larger.'' 
 Called Harbor Point, the mixed-use project is the latest in a series of bold, if not always immediately successful, moves by Antares, a Greenwich-based development and private equity firm. 
 ''We're looking for things that are big and are transforming to the markets that we do business with,'' said Joseph P. Beninati, the former chief executive of a 615-employee technology firm. Mr. Beninati co-founded Antares in 1996 with a prep school buddy, James P. Cabrera, then a president for the Galbreath Company. Antares was named after one of the brightest stars in the sky, the developers said, describing the name as a symbol of their aggressive corporate philosophy.
 Since it began acquiring properties in the tristate area five years ago, Antares has amassed billions of dollars in capital from the likes of Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and, for the South End project, Lubert-Adler Real Estate Funds. The company estimates the value of its real estate portfolio at $4.5 billion, including $171 million in land bought for Harbor Point. 
 Spread across 82 acres of former industrial sites, abandoned factories and a boatyard-marina, the project calls for the creation of five distinct neighborhoods set around parks and waterfront promenades. 
 New pedestrian walkways and the extension of major access roads from downtown will feed traffic toward the waterfront and the 15.8-acre Kosciusko Park. 
 The plan calls for roughly 4,000 residential units interspersed with at least 400,000 square feet of retail outlets, 200,000 square feet of office space, a 60-room ''boutique'' hotel and a marina. Ten percent of the residences will be reserved for families earning 30 to 80 percent of the Stamford area median family income, currently about $116,300. 
 The project, now before Stamford's Planning Board, has so far generated little opposition, largely because city officials, major employers and residents of the neglected area are eager for its revitalization.
 Some downtown merchants have expressed concern that the project's stores and restaurants might shift the focus away from the downtown core, but even Sandra Goldstein, the downtown's main advocate, is careful in her criticism. 
 ''We love probably 80 percent of the plan,'' said Ms. Goldstein, executive director of the Downtown Special Services District.
 ''Our concern relates to the intensive destination retail, which will have four or five big-box retailers on the Yale & Towne site,'' a factory site now partially occupied by antique and art dealers. Though her organization would like the city to prohibit additional retail development there, Ms. Goldstein emphasizes that ''we don't want to stop this plan.'' 
 The Harbor Point project comes fast on the heels of Antares's $223 million acquisition in February of two apartment complexes in Greenwich for conversion to condominiums. The company is also building mansions starting at $10 million on some 50 acres in backcountry Greenwich; a $40 million retail development in Armonk, N.Y.; and a 27-lot private gated community there called CiderMill. 
 ''We can't confidently say that we're the largest and the most active developer in the tristate area,'' Mr. Beninati said, ''but we're pretty sure there's no one doing more than us.''
 Some of Antares's investments have proved spectacularly successful. The holder of a 22 percent equity stake in the Pickwick Plaza office park in Greenwich and manager of the site, Antares will share in the profit of some $120 million from the pending sale of that property, which is under contract for $230 million.
 The firm is equally pleased with its 50 percent ownership stake in the Delamar Hotel, also in Greenwich, where showy yachts are commonly moored at the private dock and the average room goes for more than $300 a night. 
 But the company's record on its residential projects is less impressive. More than two years ago, Mr. Beninati said that at least 130 people were on a waiting list for 27 town homes and single-family homes at the CiderMill development in Armonk. To date, however, only 11 have sold, at prices of $1.1 million to $2.7 million. 
 ''Our sales have not gone as fast as we like because the product is more of a Ferrari than a Lexus,'' Mr. Beninati said. ''There's obviously a smaller market for that.'' 
 Sales are also slow at the two Greenwich complexes being converted to condominiums: Greenwich Oaks and Greenwich Place.
 Tenants renting at the multibuilding complexes were offered ''insider'' incentives to buy their units, priced at an average $1 million, with reductions that the developers say exceed $100,000 in some cases. Yet, Mr. Beninati said, fewer than 10 tenants have signed contracts to buy any of the 462 units. He ascribes the lack of interest to a hesitancy among longtime renters to buy and dismisses suggestions that Antares misread the market. 
 ''It's a complicated conversion process that has made for some confusion on just how they can become owners there at reasonable prices,'' he said. 
 About 260 tenants are still renting at the complexes, which are being converted building by building. Antares at first contracted with Greenwich Fine Properties to handle sales there but has now decided to use an in-house team, and recently began advertising the condominiums in earnest to outside buyers. The starting price for a one-bedroom is less than $500,000, down from the previous estimate of $600,000. 
 Now, as it gears up for the Harbor Point undertaking, Antares is thinking bigger than ever. In the future, projects like Armonk Square -- a villagelike retailing and housing plan totaling 54,000 square feet -- may be deemed too small for the company. After all, boasted Mr. Beninati, the Harbor Point project will probably be ''the largest commercial job creator in the history of the state of Connecticut.''

HEADLINE: The Border Dividing Arizona 

BYLINE: By Joseph Lelyveld. 
Joseph Lelyveld is the author most recently of ''Omaha Blues: A Memory Loop'' and a former correspondent and executive editor at The Times. His last article for the magazine was a profile of Senator Chuck Hagel.

 BODY:
When House Republicans calculated that their best bet for saving their majority was to run this fall as if illegal immigration and border security were the most urgent issues facing the country -- bigger by far than that great unmentionable, Iraq -- they were finally speaking the language of a Republican state legislator from Mesa, Ariz., named Russell Pearce. The Arizonan was there before Tom Tancredo, the Colorado congressman who talks of making a run for the White House on the issue; there before even Lou Dobbs and Rush Limbaugh if not Pat Buchanan. A fast-talking former cop, Pearce went into electoral politics only after it became clear that he wouldn't soon be able to realize his dream of becoming sheriff of Maricopa County, the area around Phoenix where more than half of Arizona lives. As a lawmaker, Pearce hasn't just embraced the issue of illegal immigration as a tactic; for him it's a passion -- his opponents say an obsession -- ''the root cause'' of almost any other problem Arizona and the nation face. Talk about terrorists and high crime rates, he'll say the border is undefended. 
Are schools failing? They're being overwhelmed by ''a population that don't put a high value to education.'' Are there a million people in Arizona without health care? ''Yeah, they broke into the country illegally. They came into the country poor, they're gonna stay poor. You've imported them!''
Russell Pearce's single-mindedness has proved to be a force in Arizona, setting the political agenda, helping to make illegal immigration the single most important and contested issue in the state. ''He's in the catbird seat,'' a Democratic officeholder conceded last spring. Pearce can point to nine bills on illegal aliens that he has helped drive to passage in the State Legislature: to authorize major expenditures of state money on border enforcement, normally a federal responsibility; to deprive ''undocumented'' residents of social services; to ban Spanish as a language of communication by state agencies and officials; to define being in the state illegally as ''trespass,'' a misdemeanor on the first offense and a felony on the second; to empower the local police to enforce immigration law. But nine times, the Democratic governor, Janet Napolitano, has turned him back with vetoes on crisply asserted fiscal and constitutional grounds, urging him and his Republican supporters to stop playing ''political games.'' 
 ''Shame, shame, shame on those who continue to ignore the No. 1 issue facing America,'' Pearce fumed last month when I visited his office at the State Capitol in Phoenix, which displayed not one but two portraits of John Wayne. The anathema he pronounced was intended not just for his governor but also for the Republican president and the Republican sponsor of the immigration-reform bill the president had backed; in Pearce's terms, ''the treacherous, treasonous bill'' the Senate passed in March. It was known as the McCain-Kennedy bill, McCain being, of course, Arizona's senior senator and, it is presumed, a leading contender for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination. And it contained two provisions Russell Pearce could not abide: a path to citizenship for longtime residents who, after entering illegally, held steady employment, learned English and paid their taxes (plus fines to be levied for entering the country without a visa); and an opening for hundreds of thousands of temporary ''guest workers'' to come across legally for limited periods of work.
 Was he saying that John McCain himself was ''treacherous, treasonous?'' I asked, interrupting Pearce's discourse in midflow. 
 ''Yes, I am,'' he replied, not pausing for breath as he raced on. 
 In Arizona, it becomes evident, the battle over illegal immigration is, in one of its dimensions, a battle over the future of the Republican Party in the state and, because of McCain's ambitions, nationally as well. It also becomes evident that what anti-immigrant zealots call an ''invasion'' is taking place not in spite of federal policies but, at least in Arizona, partly because of them. For 12 years the Border Patrol has deliberately funneled the immigrant flow away from settled urban areas like El Paso and San Diego (and, later, small Arizona border communities like Douglas and Nogales) into the Arizona deserts, where intruders can be more easily spotted, tracked and apprehended by its officers, using everything at their disposal, from high-tech sensors and drones to helicopters, jeeps, floodlights and horses. The number of arrests in Arizona alone has been running at more than half a million a year (slightly more than California, Texas and New Mexico combined for three years running). The number of arrests is larger than the number of individuals who get caught, since many are stopped two or three times. By the same token, it is almost certainly smaller than the number who eventually make it past the patrols -- by a factor of two, three or four, depending on who's doing the extrapolating in order to score what point. The average number of arrests on Arizona's 376-mile border works out to more than 1,400 a day over the last two years. An Arizona politician running on the border crisis can therefore safely assert, since no one really knows, that 5,000 or 6,000 illegal aliens cross into the state every night. 
 What cannot be disputed is that year after year, hundreds die in the desert, usually from hyperthermia (267 by the official count in fiscal year 2005, and 199 for almost the same period in 2006). Among the people who make themselves heard on radio talk shows and in Internet postings, there are some who argue that the intruders get what is coming to them. ''Break the law, pay the price. And another one bites the dust!'' said a posting by a reader reacting to another report of a death in the desert. After crosses were displayed at a small pro-immigrant rally in Phoenix on Labor Day to commemorate the dead, a talk-show host named Bruce Jacobs, who speaks about little besides the ''invasion'' on his drive-time program on the Phoenix station KFYI, objected furiously to the display, in an accent that betrayed his own distant origins, in Ronkonkoma, on Long Island. ''Whites didn't kill these people, America didn't kill these people,'' he said, his voice rising. ''They killed themselves!'' He meant that they'd be alive if they had stayed where they belonged, instead of giving in to the siren call of gainful employment in the globalized economy promoted by the United States. 
 So there's enough raw feeling out there and enough raw reality -- or so you'd think -- to make a state that has become the main thoroughfare for illegal border traffic responsive to the electoral line of House Republicans. While there were probably enough votes in the House last spring to enact some version of McCain-Kennedy had it been brought to the floor, that would have taken an ad hoc bipartisan coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans -- something the current House leadership forbids, allowing bills to come to a vote only when ''a majority of the majority'' supports them. The majority of the majority, responding to what's called its ''base,'' wants to seal the border and deny permanent residence -- which they say would amount to ''amnesty'' -- to the uncounted millions of ''illegals'' already in the country; estimates run from 8 million to 11 million to more than 20 million (roughly half of whom happen not to have crossed the border on foot but simply overstayed visas). 
 Surely a red state that has supported a Democrat only once in the last 14 presidential elections might rally to such a program. But then how come Governor Napolitano, who's up for re-election next month, was so obviously unfazed by a showy visit by the House Republican leadership, including Speaker Dennis Hastert, to the border last summer and two hearings that were staged in her state as a way of whipping up support for the caucus's position? ''If they don't know about the border by now, they don't want to know,'' she told me dismissively, spreading out her hands with the palms up and mugging a humorous look that said something like, ''Who do they think they're kidding?'' Then, realizing that my recording device could not capture her look, she filled in the blank with a sound culminating in a loud laugh. ''Pshaw,'' she said. ''That's how I'd describe it. Pshaw!'' What was needed from Congress was a workable reform, she said, not more posturing. 
 A former U.S. attorney and state attorney general -- described by her opponents as well as her supporters as ''smart'' and ''tough'' -- Napolitano has been dealing with immigration issues for a dozen years. Political photo ops by newcomers to the border don't impress her. For all the Republican efforts to nail her on immigration, it will be a huge upset if she's beaten. Does she know something the majority of the majority in Washington has yet to figure out? 
 And how come, if the issue of illegal immigration is the House majority's ticket to remaining in power, its own creature, the National Republican Campaign Committee, was spending money in the Republican primary held last month to defeat one of Russell Pearce's most conspicuous allies, a down-the-line, seal-the-border, anti-immigrant crusader named Randy Graf, in the one House race in Arizona in which a seat was clearly up for grabs? A self-proclaimed Minuteman, running in the Eighth Congressional District -- a border district in the southeastern corner of the state, the very one that gave rise to the volunteer militia known as the Minuteman Project -- Graf was leading in polls of likely primary voters. Yet the smart money in both parties seemed to be betting that a Graf victory would guarantee that the seat, Republican for the last 22 years, would swing Democratic. So while national parties normally steer clear of local primaries -- and virtually never intervene in the other party's -- out-of-state Republican money was flowing in the Eighth to a moderate with a ''common sense'' approach to immigration issues not unlike John McCain's, while national Democratic money, in a peculiar twist, was paying for ads portraying that same moderate as a wimp on illegals, in hopes of putting the supposedly beatable Randy Graf over the top in the other party's primary. 
 In talking tough on the border and on illegal immigration, Republican candidates can be said to be running against themselves. After all, they control the White House, along with both chambers of Congress, which so far this year have produced two irreconcilable pieces of legislation and therefore a stalemate. The cleavage in the party is between those who want to systematize the country's widening dependence on foreign labor (the Senate version) -- to try to take the ''illegal'' out of illegal immigration -- and those who want to slam the door (the House version). Every 10 years or so Washington is seized with the issue of immigration, and eventually a complicated, contradictory law is produced, making matters worse. After supposed reforms in 1986 and 1996, it became conspicuously harder for migrants to come and go on a seasonal basis; therefore they stayed and, at great hardship and cost, brought their families. The systematizers talk about the needs of a global economy while more and more alien workers, depending on forged Social Security cards and driver's licenses, get paid off the books by subcontractors. Taking a more populist stand, Republican door-slammers call for a crackdown on employers who have become addicted to cheap labor, just as union leaders once did before union jobs were shipped abroad. 
 In a border state like Arizona, this history is not unknown; the promise of reform and the promise of enforcement are each viewed with a certain amount of skepticism. Besides, red states are seldom red all over; often they have patches of blue, especially around large cities and universities. Arizona's Eighth is decidedly purple. It takes in much of Tucson, which is liberal by Phoenix standards, and runs to the edge of the University of Arizona campus. Republicans have a registration edge, but nearly one-third of its voters call themselves independent. Many in older generations can remember voting for Morris Udall, a venerated liberal Democrat. Also worth mentioning may be the fact that its 9,000 square miles all belonged to Mexico until the 1853 Gadsden Purchase established the border where it now stands.
 Since 1984, the district has been represented by Jim Kolbe, a friend of John McCain and like McCain a U.S. Navy Vietnam vet. Kolbe has been considered a leader on Capitol Hill in fights for the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement and programs to combat AIDS in Africa. Ever since a gay publication threatened to out him 10 years ago, the congressman has lived with a label: ''the only openly gay Republican in Congress.'' (For an example of the spread of knowledge in the information age, type those words into Google; you're instantly informed you have 958,000 ''results.'') Arizona's Eighth faithfully re-elected Kolbe thereafter and, having come out, he was quietly forthright on issues touching on sex and sexual orientation, identifying himself as pro-choice and a supporter of same-sex marriage. Kolbe seemed invulnerable, but in the 2004 Republican primary he got a bad scare from Randy Graf, who, running to his right on immigration and border issues, pulled in nearly 43 percent of the vote. 
 Last year Kolbe announced he was stepping down. When I visited his office on Capitol Hill in June, he insisted that he could have beaten Randy Graf by a wider margin in a rematch. Graf and the immigration issue, Kolbe told me, hadn't driven him from politics. (''I want to get out while people are still urging me to stay,'' he said. ''I want to get out while I can walk out and not be carried out of here.'') Kolbe had already endorsed one of Graf's primary opponents, Steve Huffman. He would never support Graf, he vowed. If, despite his best efforts, his old opponent took the nomination, Congressman Kolbe said, it was ''an absolute certainty, guaranteed'' that the seat would go Democratic. The Eighth could never be won, he said, by a ''know-nothing party person -- anti-immigrant, anti-abortion, anti-stem-cell-research, anti-gay-rights, anti-everything, right down the line.'' 
 Randy Graf is anti all those things, but his disposition is sunny and easygoing in a Midwestern way. He informs you pleasantly that he was born in St. Vincent's Hospital in Green Bay, Wisc., two months before Vince Lombardi became head coach of the Packers. Obviously he does not view this as a non sequitur. (Only 30 percent of Arizonans were born in the state, so it's not unusual for a politician to have been born somewhere else. John McCain, son of a naval officer, was born in the Panama Canal Zone; the state's other senator, Jon Kyl, a Republican, in Nebraska; Janet Napolitano, in New York City, then raised in Albuquerque.) Graf, who is now 47, moved to Green Valley south of Tucson to take up a post as a golf pro when Jim Kolbe was in his first term in Congress. Green Valley has a median age of 72.2 and a population, though it is only 40 miles from the border, that is 96.6 percent ''white non-Hispanic,'' according to a Web site for retirees looking for a place to settle. Eventually Green Valley sent Graf to the State Legislature. Though many of his supporters were also from the Midwest, they were not inclined to think of themselves as migrants. 
 Graf's political mantra was standard for a Reagan Republican when he was elected to the state House of Representatives in Phoenix in 2000. He talked about lowering taxes, downsizing government, lowering taxes, protecting the rights of gun owners and lowering taxes. The year 2000 actually set the high-tide mark for the flow of illegal aliens in what the Border Patrol calls its Tucson sector -- already by then its busiest -- encompassing an area of 90,000 square miles along 262 miles of border and including all of Graf's legislative district: the Border Patrol detained 616,346 aliens that year in the sector. As Graf tells it, it wasn't the numbers or the growing presence of the Border Patrol giving chase on highways between Green Valley and the border that drove him to seize on the issue. It was an epiphany one evening in a supermarket. He found himself, so he says, in line behind a grandmother, mother and daughter from a single Hispanic family -- the daughter, eight months pregnant -- all making their purchases with food stamps and uncomprehending when the sales clerk addressed them in English. He had no way of being sure they were here illegally, but for Graf it became a vision of a connection between taxes and illegal immigration that needed to be elevated to a cause.
 Sept. 11, 2001, added a whole other layer to this parable. ''We live in a different day and age in the post-9/11 world,'' Graf now says. ''Ninety-nine percent of them may be coming to support their families, but 1 percent of four million is still an awful lot of people.'' 
 The argument that the border must be secured because of the threat of terrorism remains largely theoretical. The Border Patrol keeps a count on non-Mexicans it detains (O.T.M.'s, they're called, for ''Other Than Mexican''). Mostly they're from Central America and farther south, but a trickle can be traced to what the Department of Homeland Security classes as ''special interest'' countries (a euphemism that refers mostly to countries in the Muslim crescent from North Africa to Pakistan). In the Tucson sector, just 15 such persons had been picked up by Sept. 10 in the fiscal year that was about to end -- scarcely one a month, a total that could easily be exceeded in an afternoon at a busy airport receiving flights from those same places. (In all its sectors, on the northern as well as southern borders, the Border Patrol detained a total of 418 aliens from the ''special interest'' countries in a period of nearly a year. The argument that the influx includes gang members and other criminal elements stands up better. The more difficult crossing the border becomes, the more opportunities there are for the human traffickers known as coyotes, who promise to steer those heading north to safe houses or cars driven by accomplices or relatives, at prices ranging as high as $2,000 a head. The Border Patrol keeps tallies of those it catches who prove to have criminal records, once its computers recognize their fingerprints. In the Tucson sector, about 440 a month are picked up with records of burglary, assault or narcotics charges. Coyotes, when they are caught, face charges of ''alien smuggling'' under the U.S. Criminal Code.)
 Randy Graf's second epiphany was also not driven by numbers. It came at the start of 2004, when he heard a Republican president speak feelingly of immigrant families from Mexico who ''bring to America the values of faith in God, love of family, hard work and self-reliance.'' Citing his own experience as a border governor, George W. Bush said that the border needed to be secured but also that a broken immigration system had to be made ''more compassionate and more humane.'' Congress should ''increase the annual number of green cards that can lead to citizenship,'' the president said. This was not what Graf wanted to hear from the leader of his party. He had a snapshot of himself and the president hanging in his office at the State Capitol; he turned the picture upside down and left it hanging that way for a couple of days as a symbol of his protest. And he decided to run for Congress, in opposition to what the president was calling a comprehensive reform. 
 Graf isn't interested in reforming the system; he wants stricter enforcement of laws on the books -- ''zero tolerance'' for illegal migrants, those trying to cross the border and those already here. If that takes putting the National Guard on the border in a military role and giving the local police the authority and resources to enforce immigration law, he's all for it. In 2004, Graf, Russell Pearce and Randy Pullen, a Republican national committeeman, were the prime shapers of Proposition 200, an Arizona state ballot initiative designed to limit the spending of government funds on services for anyone in the country illegally. Governor Napolitano and every single member of the Arizona Congressional delegation opposed it, yet it passed with 56 percent of the vote. 
 An ''honest debate'' is needed about ''changing demographics,'' Graf argues. The mass border crossings are not just illegal; in their scale, they suggest that the cultural identity of his adopted state could change. ''You can almost say that Los Angeles has been transformed already,'' he says, clinching his point with an example he seems to think will cause a shudder. A half million immigrants demonstrated there last spring. The mayor, a Latino himself, supported them. Graf saw that as a warning for Arizona. 
 One pillar of Graf's support has been in the retirement communities around Green Valley, where few residents seemed to wonder who built their houses or mowed their golf courses. Another was in frontier Cochise County, where the U.S. Army subdued the Apache chief Geronimo, where the shootout at the O.K. Corral occurred, where the Wobblies battled the copper bosses -- and where, after all that history had been turned into lore for tourists, ranchers who graze their cattle on large tracts of scrub land leased from the state became infuriated by the constant incursions of illegal aliens in large numbers. In their desperate passage, the intruders cause regular livestock losses by snipping fences, by littering the desert with plastic bottles and other debris that can play havoc with the delicate insides of a ruminant and by now and then partaking of a calf, despite the risk that even a small roasting fire might betray their whereabouts. The Graf campaign got under way in the county in 2004 at about the same time as the Minuteman Project; inevitably, they formed an alliance -- the candidate, having declared himself a Minuteman, receiving the endorsement of the movement's leader, Chris Simcox.
 I'd encountered Minutemen at the Hispanic rally at the Capitol in Phoenix on Labor Day, which failed dismally to attract a respectable fraction of the estimated 150,000 who turned out on Phoenix's streets in May waving banners and signs that said, somos america or we are america. This time the signs of the counterdemonstrators were almost as conspicuous. you are central americans, we are north americans, you are trespassers, so -- vacate -- leave, a Minuteman placard demanded. what part of illegal don't you understand? asked another. I hadn't gotten far trying to chat with the people planted under those signs, so I asked Randy Graf to introduce me to a Minuteman. To my surprise, he managed to match me up with one from my part of the country, a former consultant on new product lines who once worked in Manhattan and last lived near Princeton, N.J., before retiring in Sonoita, where he now tended several head of longhorn cattle as a hobby.
 No other houses or human activities are visible in the view through the picture windows of Gene Cafarelli's spacious high-ceilinged stucco home, exquisitely sited on a piece of what was once a 2,000-acre ranch, now divided into two dozen parcels for high-end dwellings like his, none of which are supposed to be visible from any other. What you see is not obviously different from what a Spanish conquistador passing this way in the 16th century might have seen -- a long view across a rolling valley, usually dun-colored but now, in September, turned green by the heaviest rainy season in years, to the Whetstone Mountains shimmering at a distance. But when Cafarelli goes out at night, he packs a gun, something he never thought to do in New Jersey.
 Although he has had no direct encounters with migrants, he senses their presence. Some of his neighbors have had their homes broken into while they were away; necessities like food and clothing were seized, tradable luxuries like TV's and laptops left behind. Elderly neighbors have heard Spanish outside their windows at night; the serene landscape is actually teeming. Cafarelli imagines that he was often at close quarters with illegal immigrants when he commuted to New York, but he didn't recognize the look. Now he thinks he would. If there's a problem of racism, it's the racism of the Mexican ruling classes, he thinks, cynically pleased as they are to export their poor in return for dollar remittances in the billions that the laborers then send home. 
 The Minuteman Project was in part symbolic, he acknowledged, a way of calling attention to the failure of government to secure the border. The volunteers have no power of detention; they can only call the Border Patrol when they spot intruders through their night-vision binoculars. (In fact, other citizen patrols have been known over the years to detain migrants at gunpoint.) Now, despite his 68 years, the semiretired consultant -- tall, white-haired, bronzed -- is in training with a new search-and-rescue team the Minutemen are forming. Humane Borders, a Tucson church group, trucks fresh water to stations it has planted in the desert along heavily traveled routes. The Border Patrol sends out its own rescue teams to treat dehydrated, footsore aliens. Even the Minutemen, known widely as vigilantes, have their kinder, gentler side, it seems. The day before, Cafarelli was on two four-hour training missions in the bush, returning just before midnight. Each man carried two gallons of water, one for himself, the other for anyone they might encounter. As it happened, they encountered no one.
 ''I've always admired people who combine intellectual activity with action,'' Cafarelli told me. In his mind, the Minutemen are patriots deserving of the description. 
 In the minds of other Arizonans, the Minutemen and the broader anti-immigration movement put at risk major sectors of the economy, which have long depended on a supply of migrants. Cochise growers, for instance, are often on the other side of the issue from its ranchers. I spoke to an onion farmer who said he expects to plant 100 acres next year instead of 200 because he didn't think he'd be able to hire enough harvesters. ''They yak about securing the border, yak about 'no amnesty,''' the farmer said. ''We need to secure the border, but we've got to have a guest-worker program.'' A builder I spoke to couldn't say enough about the work ethic of the migrants employed on his projects, primarily roofing or putting up drywall. ''God, do I love my boys,'' he said. ''Mind you, I don't know whether my boys are legals or not.'' He would not be surprised, the man admitted, to learn that 25 percent of them had given him bogus Social Security numbers. 
 Randy Graf, the former golf pro, wasn't the only self-described Minuteman running. Early in the year another offered himself as a Republican candidate against Governor Napolitano, running essentially a one-issue, tough-guy campaign on Arizona's responsibility -- whatever the feds did or failed to do -- to control its own southern border. Were it not for the fact that he bore Arizona's most potent political name, Don Goldwater -- a real estate investor and nephew of the late senator -- would have been described as a political nonentity: his campaign resume mentioned that he'd been a delegate to one national convention, volunteered in some campaigns and served as a den leader for the Cub Scouts. Some active Republicans said they had never heard of him. But running basically on shoe leather, the illegals and the name -- ''A name you know, a name you can trust,'' his brochures said -- the candidate, who proved to be a tireless campaigner, overcame a lack of funds and built a lead over the summer in polls on the Republican primary race.
 Goldwater's most original promise was his pledge to empower the local police to detain illegal aliens and corral them in an encampment on the border -- a ''temporary tent city,'' he called it -- where they could be put to work building fences and clearing the desert of the refuse they and those like them had scattered when they came across. When a Spanish news agency reported that Goldwater wanted to build a ''concentration camp'' for illegals, he demanded and got a retraction, but not before a statement had been put out in Washington by Senator McCain denouncing any plan for a concentration camp on the Arizona border.
 I chatted with Goldwater in September outside a movie theater in the northernmost shopping mall on Scottsdale Road, where the desert and Scottsdale's newest housing tracts bump against one another. The theater was previewing a documentary called ''The Border War,'' and a large audience of anti-immigrant stalwarts had turned out. I'd looked for evidence that his uncle had crusaded on the question of immigration, I told the candidate, and hadn't found any. Barry Goldwater, he said, always felt strongly about the rule of law. How was he feeling these days, I asked, about Senator McCain? ''He knows he won't control the state party when Don Goldwater is elected governor,'' the candidate said with calm certitude. ''He's facing a revolt by the grass roots.''
 Randy Graf endorsed Goldwater. So did Russell Pearce, one of several more prominent Republicans who'd flirted with the idea of taking on Janet Napolitano. (''I'd love to get in the ring with her,'' he said.) Another was Maricopa County's popular, showboating sheriff, Joe Arpaio, a former station chief in Mexico for the Drug Enforcement Administration who seems to enjoy the attention he gets when he hints he might run for higher office but then never does. (It was Arpaio who put up Arizona's first tent city in Phoenix, to house the county jail's overflow behind razor wire, making the point that there would be no limit to jail capacity in his jurisdiction. It has since become a photo op for presidential candidates, including George Bush in 2000 and Mitt Romney, the governor of Massachusetts, this year. Pearce, once Maricopa's chief deputy, says it was all his idea.) Most obvious as a potential candidate was Representative J.D. Hayworth, a late but fervent convert to the cause of sealing the border, who finally decided, he says, that in a time of national crisis it was more important that he hang on to his seniority in the House, for Arizona's sake.
 Each said he thought Napolitano could be beaten. Each had a reason not to take her on. That left the little-known Goldwater facing off in the Republican primary against Len Munsil, a ''movement conservative for 20 years,'' by his own description, whose dogged campaigning on pro-life, pro-abstinence, anti-pornography, anti-same-sex-marriage issues had won him a solid base among evangelicals. For Munsil -- an able candidate but far to the right by Arizona standards -- illegal immigration seemed at first to be an afterthought. But just after Labor Day, with less than two weeks to go to the primary, he proclaimed it his highest priority. As governor, he pledged, he would station the National Guard on the border, spend state money to put sensors and fences where the federal authorities had yet to put them and establish a new Arizona Border Patrol to back up the U.S. Border Patrol, which already has 3,300 officers in the state and stands to have more than 5,000 by 2008 under President Bush's promised expansion of the federal force. 
 Janet Napolitano watched the escalating arms race between the two far-right Republican gubernatorial candidates with wry humor and maybe a hint of disdain, from her office on top of a stubby tower that is built into the Arizona Capitol. She wondered where her opponents would find the cash to back up their costly promises. Would they raise taxes or cut programs and if so, which ones, she asked, offering a preview of her own campaign. Her way had been to proclaim, in August 2005, a state of emergency on the border and demand that Washington station Guard troops there and pay for them. She wrote to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and, after a month, heard from a deputy who said it was a matter for the Department of Homeland Security. Then she sent a legal brief in the form of a letter jointly addressed to Rumsfeld and the secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff. All she got back was an answering legal brief from deputies with more citations of laws and policies, bland assurances of how seriously they'd considered her plea, how earnestly they recognized the problem, how deeply they intended to deliberate on it and how little they could do. Then in May everything changed: the president announced in an Oval Office speech that he was sending the Guard to the border to take on some of the Border Patrol's auxiliary duties. The next day he flew to Yuma and posed for pictures on the border with Janet Napolitano. Arizona newspapers reported that he'd embraced her plan. Republicans who'd geared up to fight Napolitano on border issues were less than pleased. Their president had made it possible for this Democrat to claim that progress was being made. (In the same way, she's even likely to benefit from the recent announcement that the Department of Homeland Security will be paying Boeing $67 million over the next eight months to develop a system combining radar, ground sensors, cameras and unmanned aircraft that will first be tested in Arizona.)
 In fact, the number of border intruders actually started to come down over the summer. This may have had more to do with the heavy monsoon rains than with the National Guard. Napolitano herself suspects that some Mexicans have yet to figure out that the Guard is on the border to build roads, repair fences and set up observation posts, not to shoot border crossers. ''I know people need a sense that laws are being enforced,'' she told me. ''They get nervous and frustrated when they think it's out of control. And Arizonans got to the point where they believed -- I believed -- it was out of control.'' Those, she figures, who want to seal the border and bar immigrants, period, rather than ''manage the border'' won't vote for her anyway. Those who want a system that's less cruel, less chaotic are ready, she says, to consider realistic approaches. 
 So when Republicans accuse her of talking a good game and doing little or nothing, she'll retort, she says, ''When are you going to call on Washington, D.C., to do their part?'' Her idea of a workable system is more expansive than the bill the Senate passed. Like President Bush, she would go beyond a temporary ''guest worker'' program to a system that would allow for more visas and green cards for Mexican workers seeking permanent residence. The numbers would have to be adjusted to changing economic circumstances. Most important, there would have to be real penalties for American employers who hired illegals. Many such employers contribute to political campaigns, which may be why, year after year, Congress has withheld financing from agencies charged with making the sanctions it long ago enacted stick. 
 Napolitano presents herself as a problem-solver, not an ideologue. (''I think that's just so anachronistic,'' she remarked when I noted the absence of liberal rhetoric in her pronouncements.) Her tone is brisk, managerial; the language she uses is markedly cooler than the appeals to tradition and compassion found in Bush's several addresses on the subject. But she is prepared to ask, in response to Russell Pearce's complaints about the high costs of educating the huge number of Spanish-language children in Arizona schools, ''whether we want to take a failed national immigration policy out on a child in school.'' 
 ''I'm the governor of this state,'' Napolitano continued, a suggestion of heat now in her voice. ''I've got, let's assume, 160,000 kids in school who speak Spanish. They need to read and write and speak English if they're going to succeed in school. And they've got to succeed in school if they're going to succeed in life. To me, if you don't deal with these issues forthrightly, you're well on your way to creating a permanent underclass.''
 Arizonans, she says, are not easily sold on simplistic solutions to the border crisis involving little besides expenditure on law enforcement and technology. Earl de Berge, a Phoenix pollster, offered some survey results from May that seemed to show that a ''comprehensive'' reform had its own appeal in the state: 73 percent said it should be made possible for migrant workers to enter and leave the country without breaking the law. 
 It's often argued that work-seeking Mexicans drawn to the border should instead find the line at a consulate where they can apply for a visa, then wait their turn. What's missing from the discussion is the realization that there basically is no such line for the sort of semi-skilled border-crossers I repeatedly encountered on roadsides from Tucson on south, forlornly waiting to be processed and taken away by ICE (the unusually apposite acronym, for an agency called Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is pronounced as one word). On State Highway 86, a road heading west from Tucson, for instance, there were 15 who'd just been hauled from two old Chevy Cavaliers that had their backseats removed and blocks of wood jammed into the springs so that the back of the car would ride unnaturally high, not betraying the weight of the human cargo inside, covered by blankets. For the Border Patrol a high-riding old car, in which only two passengers are visible, can be as much of a tip-off as one that sags. These were young men who said they'd come all the way from Chiapas in southern Mexico to find work. 
 Here's the data on legal immigration from Mexico: In fiscal year 2005, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, 157,992 Mexicans were admitted to the United States on immigration visas, less than half the number that were caught entering the Tucson sector illegally in that same period but still about 14 percent of all immigrants who legally entered the United States that year. Of the Mexican total, 45 percent were immediate family members of persons who had already qualified for legal residence; another 40 percent were more distant relatives of legal U.S. residents, most of whom had to wait 15 years or more to have their papers processed, paying regular fees to government agencies to keep them pending. The remaining 15 percent were people who either got in on special visas for highly qualified immigrants with technical training and skills deemed to be desirable, or were among the small number officially sponsored by a prospective employer. 
 The men from Chiapas lined up next to the ICE bus had no such connections. Typical of the thousands bused back across the border every day, they may have had relatives in the United States. But it's highly unlikely that these relatives would have been legal residents. Therefore, if the migrants were determined to take the jobs that were undoubtedly waiting for them in Phoenix and points north, east and west, on construction and landscaping crews or in hotels, slaughterhouses or poultry factories, then the trek across the desert, scary and expensive as it was bound to be, would have been their only obvious and realistic way in. 
 Russell Pearce sees them, these newcomers, when he drives through the district he represents, which happens also to be the district where he grew up. They shape up early each morning in the city of Mesa at the major intersections along Broadway, an area that was the heart of the original Mormon settlement here. Sometimes Minutemen demonstrators show up with their placards and noisily chase them into sidestreets, hoping to embarrass the crew bosses and ordinary householders who come by in their pickups to engage them for a day or a few hours. Many of the migrants, it is presumed, are in transition, hoping to put aside enough cash to finance the next stage of their journey, which will take them to California or Illinois, Nebraska or North Carolina. 
 But some settle in Mesa. This is evident from the latest figures published by the Census Bureau in its American Community Survey. In 2005, Mesa -- now the nation's 40th biggest city -- was found to be 24 percent Hispanic, up from 19.7 percent only five years earlier. Its overall growth was 10 percent, more than half that growth obviously Hispanic, enough to give the City Council district around the Mormon Temple a Hispanic majority. (This could be read as a fulfillment of a panel in the frieze that goes around the temple, a panel said to depict ''the Hispanic people. . .leaving their old homes and coming to join the people of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.'')
 But there are still no Latinos on the Mesa City Council and no discernible increase in the number of Latino voters. Kyle Jones, a Mormon in his second term representing the district, said he would have considered stepping aside for a highly capable Latina candidate who ran against him in the last election if he had thought she had a chance of winning. She came in third, finishing with only 18 percent of the vote, behind not only Jones but a Minuteman running to Jones's right and drawing votes from that portion of the community that is permanently riled by their newer neighbors' tendency to hold big parties in front yards instead of on more seemly rear patios, and to play loud, unfamiliar music in an unfamiliar language. Mesa is farther from the border than Cochise County. But since it's sometimes a destination, not a thoroughfare, resentments accumulate just as surely.
 The gap between the demography of his district and its voter profile strongly suggests to Pearce that the new residents are virtually all illegal. In his lexicon, that makes them ''felons.'' Overall, 7 or 8 percent of the state's population may fall into the category of those who crossed the border without going through any legal channel, accounting for at least one-fourth and possibly one-third of its Hispanic residents. Russell Pearce acknowledges that children born in this country to these migrants are entitled to citizenship under the 14th Amendment, but he thinks something should be done about that. 
 When Pearce puts the tax burden on Arizona citizens resulting from unauthorized immigrations at well over $2 billion, he's rolling together the citizen and noncitizen Spanish speakers in public schools. What's often missed in the public debate is the fact that individual immigrant families often are neither strictly ''legal'' or ''illegal'' but an ambiguous blend. The father may have a green card, the mother not; the older children may not be naturalized, while the younger are deemed citizens by birth. In such households, there's an abiding fear of doing anything that might call attention to the dubious status of some of its members. So a child who has been an outstanding student may be discouraged by her family from applying to college if her Social Security number, or even that of a sibling, won't stand up to scrutiny. 
 I met one evening in September with five young women and their mothers, residents of a remarkably rundown trailer park in western Mesa that looked as if it hadn't been refurbished since the Korean War. Meaning to encourage candor, I said I didn't need to know their last names. Lucy, a high-school senior whose English was easy and idiomatic, completely unaccented, did much of the talking. She already understood, she said, that the local community college would be beyond her reach. Her father had spent thousands on lawyers without seeming to bring the noncitizens in the family closer to legal residence. The obstacles seemed insurmountable.
 ''I don't want people to think we're, like, invading,'' Lucy said. ''We're just trying to make, like, a better life.'' 
 The Republican races got a little crazy in the last days before the primary on Sept 12. Len Munsil, the movement conservative battling for the nomination for governor on the strength of his stand on family-values issues, found himself accused, in a ''push poll'' of uncertain origins, of having fathered an illegitimate child. This crusader for abstinence before marriage then had to confess that he and his wife had yielded to temptation and conceived the first of their eight children a month before their wedding. In the race for Jim Kolbe's seat, the congressman's designated successor, Steve Huffman, was ''unendorsed'' by The Tucson Weekly, which had backed him, for refusing to talk about a bungled undercover mission by a campaign aide caught snapping pictures through a window of a home occupied by an opponent's former wife.
 Before the results were in, two Arizonas were put on display in events held in separate hotel ballrooms. The first was a dinner honoring Congressman Kolbe, which brought 600 persons connected to Tucson's business, political and cultural elites together in the ballroom of a resort in the foothills of the Catalina Mountains. These were people who prided themselves in their ability to work across party lines. The Democratic governor was there to lead the celebration, which included videotaped tributes by Condoleezza Rice, Bono and John McCain on big screens and a cycle of love songs rendered by a soprano, winding up with ''Our Love Is Here to Stay,'' which she sang sitting knee to knee with the honoree. Kolbe seemed swept away but managed a response in which he bemoaned the rise of extreme partisanship in Congress and the decline of the art of compromise. He then thanked supporters, friends and relatives, ending with his partner, a Panamanian national, who half-rose from his seat next to Janet Napolitano to receive a round of applause that did not sound perfunctory.
 The mood was decidedly more righteous and embattled in the smaller, second ballroom in a south Tucson hotel, where fewer than 200 of Randy Graf's supporters gathered on primary night for what they hoped would be a victory party. Testing the ability of the party to come together, I asked one of Graf's supporters whether he'd be able to back Huffman if his man lost. ''I'd vote for any derelict off the street before I voted for him,'' the man said. An hour later the crowd was shouting: ''Randy! Randy! Randy!'' as their candidate claimed victory.
 But there wasn't much evidence in the results of a groundswell of fresh anger over border issues strong enough to determine the outcome of the races in November. Don Goldwater, the one-issue candidate Graf and Russell Pearce had backed, was easily beaten by Len Munsil, who waited till the last days of the campaign to broaden his base by running a TV ad in which John McCain, the nemesis of anti-migrant diehards, called him ''a man we can trust.''
 Even Graf's victory raised questions about his prospects, for his percentage of the vote was no greater than what he drew two years earlier. If the result was to be read as a referendum on immigration reform, it was hard to miss the fact that the combined vote for two runner-up candidates who supported a new guest-worker program -- the Kolbe position all these years -- amounted to slightly more than 50 percent among Eighth District Republicans. A portion of those voters were now likely to be tempted to defect to the Democratic nominee, Gabrielle Giffords, a vivacious former state senator, just 36 years old, who lines up with McCain and Napolitano to support a ''viable guest-worker program that meets the needs of Arizona's economy.'' Of course she's also for ''improved border security,'' more Border Patrol agents, more technology in the form of radar, sensors and drones. Arizona, she says, has paid a heavy price for Republican failures on the border. Like the governor, she aims to show that the immigration issue underscores the need for change in Washington; in other words, that the abiding anxiety about the border and illegal aliens can be made to work for Democrats. It may come as a surprise to tacticians in the Republican House caucus, but no candidate in red-state Arizona or anywhere else is calling for less border security. 
 Having battled his way to the nomination on the issue, Randy Graf's best shot now is to portray Gabrielle Giffords as a coddler of illegals, ''an extreme liberal'' (as she is described in a negative TV ad put up by the Minutemen) who yearns to hand out Social Security benefits to illegal aliens. (The ad even shows a check made out to ''Illegal Alien.'') Anything can happen in a campaign, but the first poll showed Giffords, the Democrat, with a commanding lead. Of course it's also possible that the Republicans will make little headway on the immigration issue in Arizona, or beyond, but still retain control of the House. In that case, the ''majority of the majority'' would be likely to continue to bar any vote on a version of the reform that passed the Senate. They'd do so out of an instinct not to cede power to moderates in their own ranks.
 Randy Graf seemed to define the breach in the Republican Party when I asked him whether he'd seek Senator McCain's support. ''I look forward to talking to John McCain,'' he said. ''It will give me a good opportunity to talk about immigration with him.'' McCain had meant to withhold his endorsement from Graf but reversed himself for the sake of a Republican majority in the House and his own relations with his party in his home state. His endorsement was silent on Graf's anti-immigrant stand. And in fact, the senator had no plans to meet the candidate.

HEADLINE: In Pennsylvania, Questions About War Erode a Traditional Republican Advantage

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

DATELINE: EDGMONT, Pa., Oct. 12 

 BODY:
When Joe Sestak announced he was running for Congress, national Democrats and media consultants told him not to talk about pulling troops out of Iraq, arguing it would only encourage the image of Democrats as weak on national security. 
 Nine months later, having ignored their advice, Mr. Sestak has put a 20-year Republican incumbent on the run for the first time, turning a bid by a political novice into a real race. Polls show that Mr. Sestak is running even or better with his opponent, Representative Curt Weldon, and that the war more than any other issue is propelling voters toward him.
Facing pressure from Mr. Sestak and a stream of bad news from Iraq, Mr. Weldon, who prides himself on his foreign policy credentials, has adopted an unconventional proposal to allow the generals on the ground, rather than President Bush as commander in chief, to decide the pace of a phased withdrawal. 
 ''That's what I've asked the president to articulate,'' Mr. Weldon said in an interview, ''but so far he's been unwilling to do so.'' 
 Mr. Sestak's persistence on the issue, and Mr. Weldon's efforts to recalibrate his position, highlight some of the ways Iraq may be altering the politics of national security after decades in which the advantage has gone to the Republicans.
 Democrats are increasingly confident that they can win on national security by arguing, as Mr. Sestak does, that going to war with Iraq ignored the more potent threats of North Korea and Iran, and that staying has left the nation unprepared to deal with crises elsewhere.
 Mr. Sestak's resume provides the Democrats an especially good opportunity to be seen as strong when it comes to protecting the country: a former three-star admiral, he worked as a national security adviser in the Clinton White House. 
 In an election where every seat matters -- Democrats need 15 to win a majority in the House -- Mr. Sestak's credentials could prove crucial. The Seventh Congressional District race here in the wealthy Philadelphia suburbs has emerged as the most competitive in one of the most competitive states for House races.
 ''We wouldn't be talking about this race if it weren't for the Iraq war,'' said G. Terry Madonna, the director of the Keystone Poll at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster. ''It's been a long time since I've seen a foreign policy issue like the war dominate a suburban Congressional race. No one can honestly believe that Sestak would be a serious challenger to Weldon if it weren't for the war. His experience has given him added credibility.''
 Mr. Weldon is not shy about foreign policy: he has made several trips to North Korea and pushed for a missile defense system. Bucking ridicule and the conclusions of the Bush administration, he has argued that the jury is still out on whether there were unconventional weapons when the United States went into Iraq, and that the 9/11 commission ignored evidence that a secret Pentagon program had identified several hijackers before the attacks. 
 But Mr. Weldon faces other issues on the foreign policy front. Law enforcement officials said Saturday, for instance, that they were investigating his role in securing lobbying contracts for his daughter's international public relations firm.
 In this race, however, Mr. Weldon has tried to run on his local bona fides -- his roots in a blue-collar town here, the money he has brought home -- dismissing Mr. Sestak, who grew up in the district but lived elsewhere for 31 years in the military. But the war has been hard to avoid.
 At an event for Republican women at the Edgmont Country Club, he talked about his successes in land preservation and economic development, and named local hospital and social service agency executives as close friends. ''I'm running on what we've done,'' he told the audience.
 A woman raised her hand: ''You need to instruct us: what about bringing home the troops, which seems to be the most important issue, and the blame and so forth on all our Republican candidates?'' she asked. ''What should campaign workers say about Republicans bringing home the troops?''
 Mr. Weldon replied, ''It's a good question, it's a tough issue,'' then outlined again his plan to let the generals decide when the Iraqi army is ready, and to dismiss an American brigade as each Iraqi one is ready. 
 ''I don't want Dick Cheney or Don Rumsfeld doing it,'' he said. ''We don't need some armchair politician back in Washington, because they want to run for office, to pick a date out of the air. The generals on the ground decide it's time to bring our troops home in a phased withdrawal, which they are doing, then that's the system we have in place.''
 ''Look, all of us want out of that war,'' he added. Then he changed the subject to North Korea, saying he was the first congressman to go there, and had just spent the weekend on the phone with the United Nations to try to resolve the nuclear crisis.
 The most recent Keystone Poll showed about a quarter of registered Republicans saying they would cross lines to vote for Mr. Sestak. He has attracted a broad coalition; in one evening, he went from a fund-raiser with Howard Dean to a meeting of suburban Republican women.
 ''People don't see a clear strategy, they don't see why we went in, they don't see how we're going to get out,'' said Anne St. Clair, a Republican who has voted for Mr. Weldon but is now leading Republicans for Sestak and had invited the women to meet him at her home in Thornton, Pa.
 Ms. St. Clair said she and her husband grew disenchanted with their party when they lived abroad in the last several years and watched the nation's reputation deteriorate. ''The current administration feels they know what's best for this country and for the rest of the world,'' she said. ''I came home and felt like I didn't recognize my party.''
 A drab conference room in East Goshen Township exploded into applause as Mr. Sestak said that he was a few points ahead in a recent poll. For an hour, the audience asked questions on North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and how to provide a powerful defense but avoid war. 
 ''I'm not antiwar,'' he told them. ''I am for a strong defense that helps to shape a global environment that moves towards peace and prosperity by having all elements of our power out there -- from diplomacy to our economy to the power of our ideals, and our military backing them up. That does not mean going on reckless misadventures like Iraq, to impose ourselves, or to go against where there really wasn't a clear and present danger.''
 His answers pleased Lowell Young, a retiree who voted for John Kerry in 2004 but said he did not like to think of himself as a Democrat.
 ''The Democrats are too wishy-washy,'' Mr. Young said, giving as an example the debate over legislation governing treatment of terrorism suspects, where the Democrats sat back while Republicans negotiated with the White House. ''They're afraid to take a stand, they're afraid they're going to be seen as weak on national security. They need a backbone. Joe seems to have it.''
 Still, national Republicans have reserved about $8 million in television time in Pennsylvania for the last month of the campaign, the bulk of it in this district. And Mr. Madonna, the pollster, said the result would probably be influenced by international events in the next several weeks. 
 ''Democrats have begun to turn their image around, but it just takes something like the London bombings to gin up fears,'' he said. ''There's just enough in the Republican arsenal -- to argue that what Clinton did on North Korea was wrong, for instance -- to keep voters not entirely comfortable with Democrats on the national security issue.''

HEADLINE: The Lone Superpower That Couldn't 

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
AFTER Libya gave up its nuclear weapons program in late 2003, President Bush was emphatic about what had led Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to sort out his relationship with Washington: The Libyan had looked down the large-caliber barrel of American power, seen the speed with which another Middle East strongman had been toppled, and thought about his future. 
 ''Before our coalition liberated Iraq, Libya was secretly pursuing nuclear weapons,'' Mr. Bush told troops at Fort Bragg, N.C. ''Today, the leader of Libya has given up his chemical and nuclear weapons programs.''
 That speech was given in June 2005, more than a year ago. Is the converse true today? 
 Have Kim Jong-il and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the men at the center of the twin confrontations that promise to dominate the last years of Mr. Bush's presidency, looked at an America still pinned down in Iraq -- its military stretched thin, its public weary of war -- and concluded that this is their moment?
 And if they have, is there much that Mr. Bush can do about it?
 As America barrels toward this nuclear showdown on opposite sides of Asia, perhaps the best measure of America's power in these matters is its need for Russia and China to cooperate. Each of these Asian giants says it dislikes the prospect of a nuclear-armed North Korea, but each is also dead set against even hinting at the use of military force if diplomacy fails. Each is also highly ambivalent about stringent sanctions, which are at the core of the strategy America wants to pursue.
 In President Bush's first term, taking the measure of American power seemed deceptively simple: The post-9/11 mood of the nation fueled Mr. Bush's impatience with weak-kneed allies who did not see threats the way he saw them, and he thought nothing of driving around them. 
 What a contrast to last Wednesday, when Mr. Bush stepped into the Rose Garden to talk chiefly about North Korea, and used the word ''diplomacy'' no fewer than 11 times. The president was repeatedly questioned about why he keeps drawing new lines in the sand -- lines the North Koreans and Iranians ignore -- and he was asked whether he regretted missing what some people saw as a last opportunity to take out North Korea's nuclear fuel supplies at the start of 2003, after the country threw out United Nations inspectors and announced it was driving headlong for the bomb. He smiled, and cast his questioners as reach-for-the-gun unilateralists lacking faith in the art of peaceful pursuasion. 
 But diplomacy works best from a position of strength. And even though the United States still boasts the world's largest military, most dynamic economy and a culture that the world snaps up, there is rising evidence that many countries -- Russia and China among them -- sniff a distinct change in the strategic atmosphere. 
 So, it seems, do the North Korean hermits and Iranian mullahs, and that may well explain why they are being defiant now. Behind their threats lies an understanding of American vulnerabilities. 
 While North Korea knows it would not last a day in a full-scale war with the United States, it skillfully exploits an American soft point when it stirs fears about its potential to sow havoc among America's Northeast Asian allies and crucial trading partners -- Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China. 
 Such fears also help to make the Chinese and Russians skittish about provoking the North Koreans too much in the nuclear bargaining. 
 The Iranians, for their part, hold two different cards: Oil and a capacity to make things even worse in Iraq and beyond. And both countries know that America's partners, having been burned in the lead-up to the Iraq war, are not eager to give the United States another resolution at the United Nations that can be read as a predicate for military action.
 ''It's a double whammy,'' said James Steinberg, the dean of the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, who dealt with North Korea as deputy national security adviser under President Clinton. The fact that America was willing to invade Iraq, he said, led North Korea and Iran to conclude that they needed nuclear weapons to deter America from putting them in its gunsights next. 
 ''That would have been the case if Iraq went well, or Iraq went badly,'' he said. ''And now, by failing to subdue Iraq and move on, we've encouraged them to conclude that there is little risk to them if they just speed forward into nuclear breakout.''
 Mr. Bush's top aides counter that such explanations are simplistic -- and tinged with election-year self-interest. No matter how popular Iraq-messed-it-up arguments are now, they add, reality is more complicated. 
 The Bush administration says diplomacy had run its course in Iraq, but has not yet in Korea. ''The diplomatic strategy we have pursued in dealing with North Korea would have been the same had we not removed Saddam Hussein from power,'' Dan Bartlett, the president's counselor, said last week. 
 For sure, ugly eruptions with North Korea date back a long way. The Korean War started in 1950, when the North Koreans mistakenly thought Washington would not fight back. And remember the Pueblo, the American spy ship captured in 1968 during another frustrating war? It is now a floating monument to ''U.S. imperial aggression forces,'' bobbing on a river in Pyongyang. 
 Similarly, American efforts to influence Iran -- overtly and covertly -- have run off the rails since the days of the shah. 
 And, of course, there is an American temptation to read every act of defiance only as a slap at or threat to America, rather than also as a play by Mr. Kim or Mr. Ahmadinejad to their home audiences.
 Still, it is hard to remember a moment when the world's sole superpower seemed less positioned to manage a fractured world. It's not only that American hard power is tied up in Baghdad and Kabul; Mr. Bush has acknowledged that soft power -- the ability to lead because you are admired -- is suffering, too. Abu Ghraib ''kind of eased us off the moral high ground,'' he volunteered at the news conference the other day.
 Mr. Bush's approach in the nuclear conundrum has been to act a bit like a major investor: gather partners with the most at stake in solving specific problems, and have them do the management -- with plenty of American oversight. But like manufacturers across America, Mr. Bush has discovered that outsourcing has its frustrations: It's hard to maintain quality control. 
 China is the current case study. It has led the ''six-party talks,'' the agonizing process of bringing the United States, North Korea, Japan, South Korea, Russia and China into one room. The last substantive meeting was more than a year ago, when all the parties signed on to some principles -- denuclearization, eventual aid to the North -- that blew apart as soon as everyone left. 
 At every step, Mr. Bush has relied on China to put pressure on North Korea -- first to come back to the table (they refused); then to halt a missile test (the North launched anyway); then to stop the nuclear test North Korea conducted last week. 
 By all accounts, the Chinese are now plenty mad with the nation they once said was ''as close as lips and teeth'' to China. But does that mean they will impose tough sanctions -- cutting off trade, or, if they really wanted Mr. Kim's attention, oil? No, because the one thing Beijing fears more than a nuclear North Korea is an imploded North Korea. They fear hungry refugees rushing over the border. They don't want a power grab for North Korea's territory that could put them in conflict with other big powers.
 The challenge facing Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice this week on her trip to Beijing, Seoul and Tokyo is to change that mindset. ''How do we do it?'' an aide said, repeating a question he had just been asked. ''We're asking the same question.''
 They could ask it as well about Russia, which is seen as the only country that can deal with the Iranians. Moscow has billions of dollars at stake in Iran's nuclear infrastructure; it went along with the Security Council resolution warning Iran of serious consequences if it keeps enriching uranium, but it is balking at really imposing them.
 Robert Gallucci, the former chief American negotiator with North Korea, sees Iran as the tougher nut to crack.
 ''I think the North Koreans in their hearts still see the United States as nine feet tall,'' he said Friday. ''To them we run the world, dictate the policies of allies and the Security Council, and project force. They want to provoke us into negotiation. But in Iran, while there is division of opinion, there are many who see the bomb as a way to hegemony -- and they know that if we don't bring the Russians along, we don't have many options.''
 In short, being a sole superpower isn't what it was cracked up to be 17 years ago. Back then, you could measure a nation's power in throw-weights. Now, it's the amount of weight you can throw around. For the next two years, Mr. Bush may have to borrow some.

To the Editor:
 Re ''China Drafts Law to Empower Unions and End Labor Abuse; Opposition Voiced by U.S. and Other Corporations'' (front page, Oct. 13): 
Since when does China lead the United States on human rights? 
 I did a double take and had to reread the opening paragraphs of your article. 
 While China is trying to support the right of workers to unionize and take decisive action against sweatshops, many American corporations are opposed to this because it will raise their labor costs.
 Cheap products from China have flooded the world economy to the benefit of millions, but the production has been possible only on the backs of Chinese workers, who often toil under difficult conditions.
 Major international companies should truly adhere to the principles of corporate social responsibility that many tout. 
 If higher costs are the price to pay for supporting human rights through improved labor practices, then as a consumer, I am all in favor.

To the Editor:
 First our Congress approved new rules for the use of torture in interrogations, how much or how bad is allowable. 
 Now our Chamber of Commerce and some major American corporations are fighting against a new labor protection law in China (''China Drafts Law to Empower Unions and End Labor Abuse; Opposition Voiced by U.S. and Other Corporations,'' front page, Oct. 13).
 Makes you proud to be an American, no?

 BODY:

IMPROMPTU OPEC MEETING -- Members of OPEC plan an emergency meeting in Doha, Qatar, to see if they can hammer out the details of a tentative plan to cut oil supplies by a million barrels a day and put a floor under prices (Thursday). Over the weekend, Edmund Daukoru of Nigeria, the president of OPEC, called the drop in crude oil prices since July ''catastrophic.'' Although the 11 members of OPEC seem to agree on the need to rid world markets of excess oil, the situation gets a bit stickier from there, with countries like Iran and Venezuela vying with bigger producers like Saudi Arabia and Algeria for market share. 


TOWARD A BETTER CANAL -- Panamanians will vote in a referendum over whether to add a third set of locks to the Panama Canal (Sunday). The country took over the canal from the United States in 1999, and although there seems to be broad agreement that the project would help bring the outdated canal up to modern standards -- making room for larger ships, for instance, and cutting wait times for vessels lingering offshore -- many Panamanians are skeptical. There is concern, among other things, that the government's $5.2 billion price tag for the seven-year project is a low estimate. Meanwhile, Nicaragua's president has proposed spending $18 billion to build a wider alternative to the Panama Canal.

INDICATORS DU JOUR -- For economic indicators, the focus this week will be on inflation, with the release of the Producer Price Index for September (Tuesday) and the Consumer Price Index for September (Wednesday). Other reports scheduled for release this week are industrial production and capacity utilization for September (Tuesday); housing starts for September (Wednesday); and leading economic indicators (Thursday).

A MONSTER EARNINGS WEEK -- Earnings season gets into full swing with some big names in the Dow. Highlights will include: Intel, I.B.M., Johnson & Johnson, McClatchy, Merrill Lynch, Motorola and Yahoo (Tuesday); AMR, Apple, Boston Scientific, eBay, General Dynamics and J. P. Morgan Chase (Wednesday); Bank of America, Citigroup, Coca-Cola, Dow Jones, Google, Honeywell, Eli Lilly, McDonald's, Nokia, Southwest Airlines, the Tribune Company and Wyeth (Thursday); and 3M and Merck (Friday).

HEADLINE: I'll Trade You My 'Titanic' For Your 'Spider-Man'

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
One of the world's oldest forms of commerce has finally gotten a foothold in the newest commercial medium. 
 Online bartering, an idea with many proponents but few successes, is emerging as an e-commerce model, bolstered by a spate of new Web sites run by veterans of the e-commerce industry. And although these sites won't soon challenge Amazon.com or eBay, they are carving out a significant niche in what could be a highly profitable business.
It sounds unlikely, but it's true, according to Billy McNair, chief executive of Peerflix, a DVD trading service based in Palo Alto, Calif. The company's 250,000 members post titles of DVD's they are willing to trade on the Web site (peerflix.com), which then facilitates the swaps by giving members printable forms that include postage and the recipient's address. 
 Trades are not directly between two people. For every DVD shipped from one's library, the sender receives credit toward the acquisition of other titles available in the network. Peerflix also determines the relative value of a DVD, to prevent people from trading, say, ''Halloween 5'' for a restored version of ''Citizen Kane.'' 
 In exchange for this service, Peerflix charges users $1.50 for each title they receive. Of that, 51 cents goes to cover the company's shipping and handling costs. 
 ''The rest comes to us,'' Mr. McNair said. ''This is an extremely high-margin business.''
 Mr. McNair, who introduced the company in 2004, said the Web site had made significant progress in the last year, with membership growing fivefold and the number of available DVD's growing at nearly the same rate. The site offers roughly 37,000 DVD titles, and has a total inventory of 225,000 copies. By comparison, the DVD rental service Netflix offers about 65,000 titles. Users trade DVD's about five times each month.
 Even though digital distribution is presumed to be the future for media businesses, Mr. McNair says he believes that physical media will remain the bedrock of the industry and of his business for the foreseeable future. About 1.5 billion DVD's are purchased annually in the United States, he said, or about 20 a household. ''And our members say they purchase more DVD's now because they know that after they watch the movie it'll still have value,'' he said.
 Investors are apparently attracted by his logic. Mr. McNair said the company in late 2004 raised about $2 million from the venture firms 3I and BV Capital, a firm founded by former executives from AOL Germany. That cash would have been more than enough to last until mid-2006, Mr. McNair said, but Peerflix raised another $8 million in October 2005, primarily from Battery Ventures, the firm behind the early search engine Infoseek. More money is on the way. 
 ''One of the key differentiators in this space will be who is best capitalized,'' Mr. McNair said. ''We have some announcements coming up that'll be well reflective of that.''
 As Peerflix ventures beyond movies and into other forms of media, as Mr. McNair says he hopes to do, it will face upstarts and established businesses at every turn. Bartering networks have sprung up, for example, around CD's (LaLa.com), video games (www.GameSwap.com) and books (PaperBackSwap.com).
 La La Media, which operates LaLa.com and is also based in Palo Alto, is another recent darling of the Silicon Valley venture capital community, having raised $9 million since the business formed in June 2005. According to Bill Nguyen, one of the company's founders, the site has built an inventory of two million titles since its debut in March, and every day members add 30,000 copies to the collection.
 ''People are starting to realize this is a really great way of finding new music,'' Mr. Nguyen said.
 La La charges $1 a trade -- about 75 cents for postage and handling costs. The company sets aside about 20 cents for musicians who perform on the disc. ''We're a little bit commie, a little bit co-op,'' Mr. Nguyen said.
 Like Peerflix, La La spends little on marketing, relying instead on its members to spread the word. The company, which has 23 employees, also spends little on customer service; members typically rely on the site's online forums to guide each other through problems, and the site has a liberal credit policy for damaged discs. (Members merely send an e-mail to the site, reporting that the disc is damaged, and they are sent another.)
 As promising as these businesses are, they represent no threat to big online companies like Netflix and Amazon, analysts said. ''The mainstream audience, in my view, is not interested in barter, given how simple renting and purchasing have become,'' said Safa Rashtchy, an Internet analyst with the investment firm Piper Jaffray. ''Barter will be a small fraction of e-commerce activity.''
 Run as they are by tiny teams of entrepreneurs, though, these companies embody the kind of asymmetric economic threat that has forced established businesses to at least take notice, if not entirely alter their business plans. Take books, for instance. PaperBackSwap's members trade 30,000 books weekly for $1.59 apiece, according to Richard Pickering, one of the site's founders. The company is now exploring ways to help members trade nonmedia items, possibly within distinct geographical areas. 
 ''You're going to see a lot more from online bartering in the future,'' Mr. Pickering said. ''This is just in its infancy.''

HEADLINE: It's Not a Klimt, but the Eastern European TV Venture Is Sweet 

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
When Ronald S. Lauder, the art collector and cosmetics heir, bought Gustav Klimt's portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer for $135 million last June, the acquisition made headlines around the world.
 But just two months later, Mr. Lauder made an even bigger deal: he quietly sold half his stake in Central European Media Enterprises, known as CME, for $190 million.
The company, which has bought up television stations throughout Eastern Europe, has fed a rising appetite for state-free television in the former Soviet bloc countries with a diet of American programming and locally produced news. The sale put a value on Mr. Lauder's holding in CME, which he founded, of $380 million, a remarkable gain on the $40 million investment he made 12 years earlier. For Mr. Lauder, who has made a number of missteps in his public life, his success in Eastern Europe was a welcome victory. 
 ''I knew the people and the places,'' Mr. Lauder recalled recently. ''Wherever I had traveled, people said they wanted TV. It had all been state-owned. They said they wanted news that was not just propaganda.'' 
 That desire for independent television has helped shift the nexus of growth for media companies. As stocks in American companies have risen, CME shares have soared. Since Jan. 2, 2003, CME shares have risen 1,078 percent to close Friday at $69.28 a share, up from $5.88. In contrast, Time Warner has risen 43 percent in that time, while the News Corporation is up 80 percent and The Walt Disney Company is up 80 percent. Those companies continue to confront the slowing growth of the American economy and the complexities of managing diversified conglomerates. 
 CME, with a market capitalization of $2.8 billion, has TV stations in several markets where political turmoil has diminished and advertiser spending has increased. The company points out that in Western Europe, advertiser spending is $73.72 per capita, but is only $27.50 per capita in Eastern Europe in general, and even less for CME's stations. That, says CME's chief executive, Michael N. Garin, leaves a lot of opportunity. 
 To some American investors, the performance of CME is reminiscent of the United States years ago, when viewership and ad spending clocked steady gains. 
 ''This is where the U.S. was in the 1950's,'' said David J. Londoner, whose former firm, Schroder Wertheim, took CME public in the mid-1990's.
 Given the run-up in the company's stock in recent years, some CME skeptics, including Dennis H. Leibowitz, who heads Act II Partners, a media hedge fund, say they believe CME stock is fully priced. But Mark A. Riely, whose hedge fund Media Group Investors owns about 800,000 shares, is staying in, believing there is still a lot of opportunity to increase ad revenue. 
 CME's success is something of an anomaly for Mr. Lauder. Although he is regarded as one of this country's savviest art collectors -- he was chairman of the Museum of Modern Art for a decade until 2005 and in 2001 he opened his Neue Galerie in New York -- not all of his other ventures in business and politics have worked out so well. 
 Indeed, one of the stated reasons for taking the Estee Lauder Companies public in 1995 was Mr. Lauder's need to pay off $200 million he owed banks and the company. 
 In the intervening decade, he has continued to cash out of Estee Lauder stock, selling millions of shares. And even today nearly all his remaining 13.54 million shares, valued at about $550 million, are pledged either to family trusts or a consortium of banks, according to the most recent company filings. In 2001, his RSL Communications, an international telecommunications company, went bankrupt in the technology bubble. 
 It wasn't just in business that he took his lumps. His ambassadorship to Austria generated some criticism for, among other things, employing a bodyguard at his mother's insistence. He was trounced when he ran for mayor of New York City in 1989, a race that cost him $14 million. 
 Mr. Lauder's fortunes have seemingly reversed, however. The Neue Galerie, where his Klimt now hangs, has received rave reviews. And after some rocky years, CME has paid off handsomely.
 Mr. Lauder began acquiring television licenses in Eastern Europe in the early 1990's after the Berlin Wall fell. The company now owns stations in Slovakia, Romania, Ukraine and Slovenia, all of them profitable. Its most important station, TV Nova in the Czech Republic, dominates its market. For the first six months of this year, the station accounted for 34 percent of CME's $276.3 million in net revenues and 44 percent of its $96.1 million in cash flow from television stations. And TV Nova's cash flow for the first six months of this year increased 49.4 percent.
 But the Eastern European market is not without significant risks. CME spent $20 million two years ago to buy Nova TV in Croatia and invested an additional $60 million to upgrade the station. But it is expected to lose $17 million this year. Mr. Garin cited both political and economic problems in Croatia, where there are currently four networks. 
 ''Two are owned by the state and two are commercial,'' said Mr. Garin, who joined the company in 2004. ''Croatia is the only country in Europe where stations get three sources of revenue: license fees, advertising revenue and a direct subsidy from the Parliament. The state-owned stations can afford to buy programming, such as movie packages, that private companies cannot buy.''
 But he added that when Croatia joined the European Union in several years, it would no longer be allowed to subsidize television stations, and that would level the playing field. But that is some time off, and meanwhile the station continues to lose money. Over all, however, cash flow for CME's six television stations together continues to rise. 
 Several analysts and investors, including David B. Kestenbaum, of Morgan Joseph, said they looked to the organic growth of the stations to measure the company's health, rather than at net income, which has been volatile, partly because of currency fluctuations. 
 Nowhere has the company's survival been more severely tested than in the Czech Republic. The station there had its debut in 1994 with some Western-style programming, including ''Baywatch.'' But in 1999, CME's partner in TV Nova, Vladimir Zelezny, turned off the signal and, with the station's staff, began broadcasting from another location. 
 The company's stock dropped so precipitously that Frederic T. Klinkhammer, then the company's chief executive, did a reverse split to try to prevent delisting. He failed, and for two years the stock was delisted from Nasdaq. It took Mr. Klinkhammer four years of fighting, but in 2002 CME won $29 million from Mr. Zelezny in a ruling by the International Court of Arbitration.
 Then in May 2003, the Czech Republic was forced to pay the company $355 million for failing to protect the majority owners of TV Nova. The ruling was made by a Swedish appellate court that upheld an earlier ruling in the company's favor by an international arbitration panel. 
 By the time the settlement was announced on May 14, 2003, CME's stock had already climbed 50 percent, and it has mostly continued upward since. The stock rose even though the company ultimately chose to buy back TV Nova from the investment group PPF and a private investor for a total of $910 million. 
 The Czech fiasco was the company's worst moment. But Mr. Lauder and his company have generated their share of other criticism over the years. In Czechoslovakia, for example, the company was accused of going downmarket. 
 ''To win the license, they presented a program that was to be accessible and enlightened, but the moment they got the station they went downmarket,'' said Jan Culik, professor of Czech studies at the University of Glasgow. ''In a democracy you are expected to honor that commitment.'' 
 Instead, he said, the station carried game shows, American soap operas, news heavy on crime and a weather forecast in which the forecaster ''would appear naked before the camera and get dressed according to what weather was to follow the next day,'' he said. 
 Last week Mr. Lauder said ''the station's news was balanced,'' and he could not comment on its quality, because ''I don't speak the language.'' 
 Mr. Zelezny was not the only partner of Mr. Lauder whose character has raised questions. In Ukraine, Mr. Lauder struck a partnership with Vadim Rabinovitch. Though Mr. Rabinovitch was a self-made mogul who had the political connections and television experience Mr. Lauder needed, he had also served 10 years in prison for theft. Mr. Lauder has said he was not aware of that when he entered the deal. 
 A rival broadcaster, Perekhid Media Enterprises, alleged in a $750 million lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court that Mr. Lauder's company had used bribes to land its broadcast license -- an allegation that Mr. Lauder's company denied. That case was ultimately dismissed. 
 For the most part, the political atmosphere in the countries CME operates has calmed down. Mr. Lauder, however, is likely to face new competition, as sophisticated competitors look to get a piece of the still-growing television market. CME now has to compete with RTL, owned by Bertelsmann, and the Modern Times Group, a Swedish broadcaster, as well as Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which owns five stations in Eastern Europe and Turkey. 
 And there is still no certainty that such young governments can promise stability. 
 Mr. Lauder says he has no plans to sell his remaining shares. And in an investment world where CME's American counterparts are contemplating stodgy growth, the company's investors seem willing to stay tuned.
